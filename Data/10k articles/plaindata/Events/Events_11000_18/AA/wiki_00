Enlistments had reduced the number of able-bodied men available to play football, the war effort had reduced the number of men able to commit time to running the football clubs in an administrative capacity, and the military had already commandeered North Port Oval and Beach Oval and was potentially going to commandeer Point Gellibrand, the Coburg City Oval and Brunswick Oval.\n\nDespite this, Northcote, Coburg, Brunswick, Yarraville, Brighton and Oakleigh wanted to play the season at the VFA’s April meeting, but Preston, Williamstown, Prahran, Camberwell, Port Melbourne and Sandringham had doubts or were outright against playing. On 20 April, the Association board of management decided to cancel the premiership season for 1942. It is believed that had the season been played, no more than six of the twelve clubs would have been able to field a team. The seconds premiership was also cancelled. The Association premiership was not staged again until 1945, although the seconds competition re-commenced in 1944.\n\nWith the Association in recess, two of its grounds were used by League clubs whose grounds had been commandeered: played its games at Yarraville Oval, and played its games at Toorak Park.\n"}

Drawing inspiration from the 1974 FIFA World Cup which was held in Munich, the rally began in London, Great Britain and travelled to Munich, Germany, via northern Africa. It was won by the privateer Australian crew of Jim Reddiex, Ken Tubman and André Welinski, driving a Citroen DS.\n\n70 cars entered the race - 19 finished. The number of cars entering was lower than the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally as the 1973 oil crisis and the resultant drop in global car sales had its effect on motorsport budgets. Many of the manufacturer teams of the 1970 event did not take part four years later. An error in the navigation notes of the event, caused by the end of a road in Algeria being extended several miles in between the compilation of the notes and the rally taking place saw the majority of competitors becoming lost in the Algerian Sahara Desert. This, in combination with the most gruelling terrain ever traversed by an international rally to that point saw only seven cars travel the full distance south into Nigeria, with only five then completing the full competition distance to Germany. Of the remainder of the \"Kano Seven\". the Lancia Fulvia of Shekhar Mehta and Lofty Drews suffered engine problems on the return leg from Kano to Tamanresset, was towed to Tunis and air-freighted to Salzburg to take part in the final part of the event. The V8 Jeep crewed by Americans Brian Chuchua, Douglas Fortin and Richard Clark made it through Africa, but crashed out of the event following a collision with a large dog in Turkey.\n\nThe majority of the competition did not complete the southern-most leg of the rally, south of the Tamanrasset rally point. Aerial searches for lost competing vehicles were conducted and eventually all cars were accounted for with no casualties. Some competitors abandoned the route and found their own way out of Africa. Notably former Grand Prix racer Stirling Moss and his co-drivers Mike Taylor and Allan Sell in their Mercedes-Benz arrived at an Algerian military fort with no water to find it abandoned. Moss and his crew-mates were unable to continue until the arrival of a water convoy in the following days.\n\nTime penalties quickly climbed into large figures during the stages held in Africa with the majority of the field finishing with over a week's worth of time penalties at the finish. The gap between the winning Citroën DS over the first of the factory supported Peugeots that finished second, third and fourth was over 28 hours. The 19th and last classified finisher acquired over 450 hours of time penalties, approximately 18 days behind the winners.\n\nThe course covered approximately through Europe and northern Africa before returning to Europe. Some of the principal towns and cities visited were, in order:\n\n\nThe course included many special stages, some over long. Time penalties were given for exceeding set times on the special stages, as well as for other infractions of the rules, and the cars' positions determined by the penalties awarded rather than lowest cumulative times.\n\nOnly 19 cars finished the event, with only five cars completing the full rally distance. The route included a 171 km loop in the Hoggar mountains on the southbound transition of Algeria; of the \"Kano Seven\" only the winning Citroën and the Lancia Fulvia of Shekhar Mehta and Lofty Drews completed this part of the course. The Escort of Eric Jackson and Bob Bean also completed the loop, but although they started the leg to Kano, they turned back for Tamanrasset after incurring suspension damage in Niger.\n"}

Vigil, who established the Atlántida Publishing House in 1918. The company's homonymous weekly would also be its first publication. \"Atlántida\" was designed as a news and general interest weekly tailored primarily for women (the company would concurrently launch \"El Gráfico\", for sports readers, and the children's magazine \"Billiken\"). Vigil named both the publishing house and its flagship magazine from a poem of the same name by Olegario Víctor Andrade, who wrote it as an homage to Americanism.\n\n\"Atlántida\" was an early success, with a circulation of 45,000 of its maiden issue (March 7, 1918), and of 56,000 by the end of the year. Its chief competition was \"El Hogar\", printed by Editorial Haynes since 1904; \"Atlántida\" generally appealed to a more upscale readership, however. Advertisers secured space in the magazine months in advance, and news agents forfeited the right to return unsold copies. Adopting as one of its missions \"the destruction of barbaric prejudices which purport women to be inferior,\" \"Atlántida\" featured watercolor images of debonair women on its covers, and featured a women's interest section, \"En rueda de damas\" (\"Ladies' Round\"). It also included sections on culture and the day's politics, notably \"El salón de los pasos perdidos\" (in reference to a pavilion in the Argentine Congress) and a special supplement printed following the 1930 Argentine coup d'état: \"La Revolución del 6 de Septiembre\". The magazine's editorials, titled \"La vida que pasa\" (\"Life as It Happens\") initially reflected Vigil's humanist views. These editorials opposed World War I, and advocated for the rights of poor children, the disabled, and Argentine Amerindians, among other traditionally disenfranchised groups. \n\nThe magazine was also notable for its regular contributors, which included Leopoldo Lugones, Gabriela Mistral (from Chile), and Alfonsina Storni. A glossy insert, \"La Semana Gráfica\", was added to publish special reports, and the magazine was the first in Argentina to incorporate entry submission contests, whereby once a month readers were invited to submit witty captions for a given photograph; these contests attracted up to 15,000 entries monthly.\n\n\"Atlántida\" was eclipsed by its longtime rival, \"El Hogar\", during the 1940s and '50s, and it became a monthly publication. The magazine's distinctive watercolor covers were created by Spanish illustrator Roberto Martínez Baldrich between 1953 and his death in 1959, after which its covers adopted a news magazine format. \"Atlántida\" was affected by competition from a growing number of news magazines in Argentina during the 1960s, notably \"Panorama\", \"Primera Plana\", and \"Siete Días Ilustrados\", among others. The 1965 launch of \"Gente\", a celebrity magazine, by its publishers further diffused its readership, and \"Atlántida\" became largely devoted to cultural and current events commentary. The magazine closed in 1970.\n"}

According to tradition, Siddhartha had recently forsaken years of extreme ascetic practices and resolved to sit under a peepal tree and simply meditate until he found the root of suffering, and how to liberate oneself from it.\n\nTraditions vary on what happened. Some say Siddhartha made a great vow to Nirvana and Earth to find the root of suffering, or die trying. In other traditions, while meditating he was harassed and tempted by the god Mara (literally, \"Destroyer\" in Sanskrit), demon of illusion. Other traditions simply state that he entered deeper and deeper states of meditation, confronting the nature of the self.\n\nIn the Pali Canon, there are several discourses said to be by Buddha himself, relating to this story. In The Longer Discourse to Saccaka (MN 36), the Buddha describes his Enlightenment in three stages:\n\n\nIn his words:\n\nAll traditions agree that as the morning star rose in the sky in the early morning, the third watch of the night, Siddhartha finally found the answers he sought and became Enlightened, and experienced Nirvana. Having done so, Siddhartha now became a Buddha or \"Awakened One\".\n\nThe enlightenment of the Buddha is yearly celebrated in many Buddhist countries.\n\nBodhi Day is observed in many mainstream Mahayana traditions including the traditional Zen and Pureland Buddhist schools of China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. In Japanese Zen, it is also known as \"Rohatsu\". In Tendai and other Japanese sects, it is called either or simply .\n\nServices and traditions vary amongst Buddhist sects, but all such services commemorate the Buddha's achievement of Nirvana, and what this means for Buddhism today. Individuals may choose to commemorate the event through additional meditation, study of the Dharma, chanting of Buddhist texts (sutras), or performing kind acts towards other beings. Some Buddhists celebrate with a traditional meal of tea, cake, and readings.\n\nThe word \"Rōhatsu\" (臘八) is Japanese and literally means 8th Day of the 12th Month. It is typical for Zen monks and layman followers to stay up the entire night before Rohatsu practicing meditation, and the holiday is often preceded by an intensive sesshin. It is observed on the Gregorian date of December 8 as a result of the Westernization of Japan during the Meiji Restoration (1862–1869).\n\nThe Chinese version of this festival is called \"Laba\" (臘八) which means the Eighth Day of the La (or the Twelfth) Month of the Chinese Lunar Calendar. It is most often observed in the first half of January, but it may happen on a date between the Winter Solstice (December 22) and the Chinese New Year (between January 22 and February 21).\n\nBodhi Day is not as popularly celebrated as Vesak Day, on which the birth, enlightenment (Nirvāna), and passing away (Parinirvāna) of Gautama Buddha are celebrated.\n"}

The band played across the US, Canada and Mexico, with many shows ending in riots. \n\nThe management company behind the Bogus Deep Purple registered \"Deep Purple\" as an LLC in February 1980 and mentioned that an album was to be recorded.\n\nOn 18 August 1980, the real Deep Purple put an ad in a newspaper underneath an ad for a Bogus Deep Purple concert that was to take place at Long Beach Arena in California, stating:\n<poem>\nThe following STARS WILL NOT PERFORM at the\nDeep Purple Concert at\nLong Beach Arena Tomorrow, Aug. 19, 1980.\n\nRITCHIE BLACKMORE\nDAVID COVERDALE\nIAN GILLAN\nROGER GLOVER\nGLEN HUGHES (sic)\nJON LORD\nIAN PAICE\n</poem>\nThe real Deep Purple were contacted about the bogus Deep Purple, and their management sued Evans, given that he was the only member of the band who received booking royalties and who had any rights to the name \"Deep Purple\". Evans was sued for damages of $672,000 (USD) (US$ in dollars) for using the band name without permission, which included $168,000 in actual damages (US$ in dollars) and $504,000 (US$ in dollars) in punitive damages. Being unable to pay this amount, Evans was required to forfeit all future royalties from the albums and singles recorded by the Mark I lineup of Deep Purple. This effectively ended Evans' career as a performing musician, as any future earnings he made from performing would have to be paid toward the lawsuit and since then, he no longer receives royalties for his work with Deep Purple.\n\nBoth Ian Paice and Jon Lord remarked it was not about money, but about saving the good name of Deep Purple. Paice stated, \"We didn't make that money, it all went to the lawyers involved. [But] the only chance to stop that band was to sue Rod.\" Lord acknowledged that he did not enjoy having to testify in court against Evans and blamed him for being silly.\n\n\nThe instrumentalists had previously played in a fake Steppenwolf band organised by the same management company a few years before - in fact, there is one gig report stating that the Bogus Steppenwolf opened for the Bogus Deep Purple, using exactly the same backing band.\n\n"}

It marked the beginning of the final stage of Tyrone's Rebellion when the Earl became a fugitive, before his sudden reprieve the following year.\n\nFollowing the defeat of his army at the 1601 Battle of Kinsale, Tyrone retreated into his heartland in County Tyrone, Ulster. Courted by the Crown, many of his allied Gaelic lords now changed sides, which turned much of the local population against him. Tyrone was faced with a three-pronged pincer movement with separate forces under Henry Docwra, Arthur Chichester and Lord Mountjoy advancing on him from Derry, Carrickfergus and Dundalk respectively. A major tactic of Tyrone's had been to avoid fighting stand-up battles, preferring to retreat and ambush. He therefore decided to abandon the town and gave orders to torch it.\n\nSoon after his cousin and enemy, Conn MacShane O'Neill, the son of Shane O'Neill, seized the castle and held it against the Earl. Mountjoy then occupied the ruins of Dungannon. Tyrone and what remained of his followers retreated into the Glenconkeyne Woods where he continued to evade capture. Despite his military defeat, Tyrone was restored to royal favour following political developments in London. The resulting Treaty of Mellifont gave Tyrone a full pardon and restored his territories to him. Tyrone then travelled to London to submit to the new King James I. Following the Treaty, the Earl repossessed his lands and began the rebuilding of Dungannon.\n\n"}

{"id": "60575", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60575", "title": "Cardiac arrest", "text": "Cardiac arrest\n\nCardiac arrest is a sudden loss of blood flow resulting from the failure of the heart to effectively pump. Symptoms include loss of consciousness and abnormal or absent breathing. Some individuals may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea before cardiac arrest. If not treated within minutes, it typically leads to death.\nThe most common cause of cardiac arrest is coronary artery disease. Less common causes include major blood loss, lack of oxygen, very low potassium, heart failure, and intense physical exercise. A number of inherited disorders may also increase the risk including long QT syndrome. The initial heart rhythm is most often ventricular fibrillation. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding no pulse. While a cardiac arrest may be caused by heart attack or heart failure, these are not the same.\nPrevention includes not smoking, physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight. Treatment for cardiac arrest includes immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and, if a shockable rhythm is present, defibrillation. Among those who survive, targeted temperature management may improve outcomes. An implantable cardiac defibrillator may be placed to reduce the chance of death from recurrence.\nIn the United States, cardiac arrest outside hospital occurs in about 13 per 10,000 people per year (326,000 cases). In hospital cardiac arrest occurs in an additional 209,000. Cardiac arrest becomes more common with age. It affects males more often than females. The percentage of people who survive with treatment is about 8%. Many who survive have significant disability. However, many American television programs have portrayed unrealistically high survival rates of 67%.\n\nCardiac arrest is preceded by no warning symptoms in approximately 50 percent of people. For those who do experience symptoms, they will be non-specific, such as new or worsening chest pain, fatigue, blackouts, dizziness, shortness of breath, weakness and vomiting. When cardiac arrest occurs, the most obvious sign of its occurrence will be the lack of a palpable pulse in the victim. Also, as a result of loss of cerebral perfusion (blood flow to the brain), the victim will rapidly lose consciousness and will stop breathing. The main criterion for diagnosing a cardiac arrest, as opposed to respiratory arrest, which shares many of the same features, is lack of circulation; however, there are a number of ways of determining this. Near-death experiences are reported by 10 to –20 percent of people who survived cardiac arrest.\n\nCertain types of prompt intervention can often reverse a cardiac arrest, but without such intervention, death is all but certain. In certain cases, cardiac arrest is an anticipated outcome of a serious illness where death is expected.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) occur when the heart abruptly begins to beat in an abnormal or irregular rhythm (arrhythmia). Without organized electrical activity in the heart muscle, there is no consistent contraction of the ventricles, which results in the heart's inability to generate an adequate cardiac output (forward pumping of blood from heart to rest of the body). There are many different types of arrhythmias, but the ones most frequently recorded in SCA and SCD are ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF).\n\nSudden cardiac arrest can result from cardiac and non-cardiac causes including the following:\n\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), also known as ischemic heart disease, is responsible for 62 to 70 percent of all SCDs. CAD is a much less frequent cause of SCD in people under the age of 40.\n\nCases have shown that the most common finding at postmortem examination of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is chronic high-grade stenosis of at least one segment of a major coronary artery, the arteries that supply the heart muscle with its blood supply.\n\nStructural heart disease not related to CAD (i.e. hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, congenital coronary artery anomalies, myocarditis) account for 10% of all SCDs. Examples of these include: cardiomyopathy, cardiac rhythm disturbances, myocarditis, hypertensive heart disease, and congestive heart failure.\n\nLeft ventricular hypertrophy is thought to be a leading cause of SCD in the adult population. This is most commonly the result of longstanding high blood pressure which has caused secondary damage to the wall of the main pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle.\n\nA 1999 review of SCDs in the United States found that this accounted for over 30% of SCDs for those under 30 years. A study of military recruits age 18-35 found that this accounted for over 40% of SCDs.\n\nCongestive heart failure increases the risk of SCD fivefold.\n\nArrhythmias not due to structural heart disease account for 5 to 10% of SCDs.\n\nExamples of arrhythmic syndromes associated with SCD include: Long QT syndrome, Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, Brugada Syndrome, Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.\n\nLong QT syndrome, a condition often mentioned in young people's deaths, occurs in one of every 5000 to 7000 newborns and is estimated to be responsible for 3000 deaths each year compared to the approximately 300,000 cardiac arrests seen by emergency services. These conditions are a fraction of the overall deaths related to cardiac arrest, but represent conditions which may be detected prior to arrest and may be treatable.\n\nSCA due to non-cardiac causes accounts for the remaining 15 to 25%.\n\nThe most common non-cardiac causes are trauma, bleeding (such as gastrointestinal bleeding, aortic rupture, or intracranial hemorrhage), overdose, drowning and pulmonary embolism. Cardiac arrest can also be caused by poisoning (for example, by the stings of certain jellyfish).\n\n\"Hs and Ts\" is the name for a mnemonic used to aid in remembering the possible treatable or reversible causes of cardiac arrest.\n\nThe risk factors for SCD are similar to those of coronary artery disease and include age, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, lack of physical exercise, obesity, diabetes, and family history. A prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest also increases the risk of future episodes.\n\nCurrent cigarette smokers with coronary artery disease were found to have a two to threefold increase in the risk of sudden death between ages 30 and 59. Furthermore, it was found that former smokers’ risk was closer to that of those who had never smoked.\n\nThe mechanism of death in the majority of people dying sudden cardiac deaths is ventricular fibrillation. Structural changes in the diseased heart as a result of inherited factors (mutations in ion-channel coding genes for example) cannot explain the suddenness of SCD. Also, sudden cardiac death could be the consequence of electric-mechanical disjunction and bradyarrhythmias.\n\nCardiac arrest is synonymous with clinical death.\nA cardiac arrest is usually diagnosed clinically by the absence of a pulse. In many cases lack of carotid pulse is the gold standard for diagnosing cardiac arrest, as lack of a pulse (particularly in the peripheral pulses) may result from other conditions (e.g. shock), or simply an error on the part of the rescuer. Nonetheless, studies have shown that rescuers often make a mistake when checking the carotid pulse in an emergency, whether they are healthcare professionals or lay persons.\n\nOwing to the inaccuracy in this method of diagnosis, some bodies such as the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) have de-emphasised its importance. The Resuscitation Council (UK), in line with the ERC's recommendations and those of the American Heart Association,\nhave suggested that the technique should be used only by healthcare professionals with specific training and expertise, and even then that it should be viewed in conjunction with other indicators such as agonal respiration.\n\nVarious other methods for detecting circulation have been proposed. Guidelines following the 2000 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) recommendations were for rescuers to look for \"signs of circulation\", but not specifically the pulse. These signs included coughing, gasping, colour, twitching and movement. However, in face of evidence that these guidelines were ineffective, the current recommendation of ILCOR is that cardiac arrest should be diagnosed in all casualties who are unconscious and not breathing normally. Another method is to use molecular autopsy or postmortem molecular testing which uses a set of molecular techniques to find the ion channels that are cardiac defective.\n\nClinicians classify cardiac arrest into \"shockable\" versus \"non–shockable\", as determined by the ECG rhythm. This refers to whether a particular class of cardiac dysrhythmia is treatable using defibrillation. The two \"shockable\" rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia while the two \"non–shockable\" rhythms are asystole and pulseless electrical activity.\n\nWith positive outcomes following cardiac arrest unlikely, an effort has been spent in finding effective strategies to prevent cardiac arrest. With the prime causes of cardiac arrest being ischemic heart disease, efforts to promote a healthy diet, exercise, and smoking cessation are important. For people at risk of heart disease, measures such as blood pressure control, cholesterol lowering, and other medico-therapeutic interventions are used. A Cochrane review published in 2016 found moderate-quality evidence to show that blood pressure-lowering drugs do not appear to reduce sudden cardiac death.\n\nIn medical parlance, cardiac arrest is referred to as a \"code\" or a \"crash\". This typically refers to \"code blue\" on the hospital emergency codes. A dramatic drop in vital sign measurements is referred to as \"coding\" or \"crashing\", though coding is usually used when it results in cardiac arrest, while crashing might not. Treatment for cardiac arrest is sometimes referred to as \"calling a code\".\n\nPeople in general wards often deteriorate for several hours or even days before a cardiac arrest occurs. This has been attributed to a lack of knowledge and skill amongst ward-based staff, in particular a failure to carry out measurement of the respiratory rate, which is often the major predictor of a deterioration and can often change up to 48 hours prior to a cardiac arrest. In response to this, many hospitals now have increased training for ward-based staff. A number of \"early warning\" systems also exist which aim to quantify the person's risk of deterioration based on their vital signs and thus provide a guide to staff. In addition, specialist staff are being used more effectively in order to augment the work already being done at ward level. These include:\n\nAn implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a battery powered device that monitors electrical activity in the heart and when an arrhythmia or asystole is detected is able to deliver an electrical shock to terminate the abnormal rhythm. ICDs are used to prevent sudden cardiac death (SCD) in those that have survived a prior episode of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia (secondary prevention). ICDs are also used prophylactically to prevent sudden cardiac death in certain high risk patient populations (primary prevention).\n\nNumerous studies have been conducted on the use of ICDs for the secondary prevention of SCD. These studies have shown improved survival with ICDs compared to the use of anti-arrhythmic drugs. ICD therapy is associated with a 50% relative risk reduction in death caused by an arrhythmia and a 25% relative risk reduction in all cause mortality.\n\nPrimary prevention of SCD with ICD therapy for high risk patient populations has similarly shown improved survival rates in a number of large studies. The high risk patient populations in these studies were defined as those with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy (determined by a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)). The LVEF criteria used in these trials ranged from less than or equal to 30% in MADIT-II to less than or equal to 40% in MUSTT.\n\nMarine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been promoted for the prevention of sudden cardiac death due to its postulated ability to lower triglyceride levels, prevent arrhythmias, decrease platelet aggregation, and lower blood pressure. However, according to a recent systematic review, omega-3 PUFA supplementation are not being associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death.\n\nSudden cardiac arrest may be treated via attempts at resuscitation. This is usually carried out based upon basic life support (BLS)/advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS) or neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) guidelines.\n\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a key part of the management of cardiac arrest. It is recommended that it be started as soon as possible and interrupted as little as possible. The component of CPR that seems to make the greatest difference in most cases is the chest compressions. Correctly performed bystander CPR has been shown to increase survival; however, it is performed in less than 30% of out of hospital arrests . If high-quality CPR has not resulted in return of spontaneous circulation and the person's heart rhythm is in asystole, discontinuing CPR and pronouncing the person's death is reasonable after 20 minutes. Exceptions to this include those with hypothermia or who have drowned. Longer durations of CPR may be reasonable in those who have cardiac arrest while in hospital. Bystander CPR, by the lay public, before the arrival of EMS also improves outcomes.\nEither a bag valve mask or an advanced airway may be used to help with breathing.. High levels of oxygen are generally given during CPR. Tracheal intubation has not been found to improve survival rates or neurological outcome in cardiac arrest and in the prehospital environment may worsen it. When done by EMS 30 compressions followed by two breaths appear better than continuous chest compressions and breaths being given while compressions are ongoing.\nFor bystanders, CPR which involves only chest compressions results in better outcomes as compared to standard CPR for those who have gone into cardiac arrest due to heart issues. Mechanical chest compressions (as performed by a machine) are no better than chest compressions performed by hand. It is unclear if a few minutes of CPR before defibrillation results in different outcomes than immediate defibrillation. If cardiac arrest occurs after 20 weeks of pregnancy someone should pull or push the uterus to the left during CPR. If a pulse has not returned by four minutes emergency Cesarean section is recommended.\n\nDefibrillation is indicated if a shockable rhythm is present. The two shockable rhythms are ventricular fibrillation and pulseless ventricular tachycardia. In children 2 to 4 J/Kg is recommended.\n\nIn addition, there is increasing use of public access defibrillation. This involves placing an automated external defibrillator in public places, and training staff in these areas how to use them. This allows defibrillation to take place prior to the arrival of emergency services, and has been shown to lead to increased chances of survival. Some defibrillators even provide feedback on the quality of CPR compressions, encouraging the lay rescuer to press the person's chest hard enough to circulate blood. In addition, it has been shown that those who have arrests in remote locations have worse outcomes following cardiac arrest.\n\n medications, while included in guidelines, have not been shown to improve survival to hospital discharge following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. This includes the use of epinephrine (adrenaline), atropine, lidocaine, and amiodarone. Epinephrine is generally recommended every five minutes. Vasopressin overall does not improve or worsen outcomes compared to epinephrine. The combination of epinephrine, vasopressin, and methylprednisolone appears to improve outcomes.\n\nEpinephrine does appear to improve short-term outcomes such as return of spontaneous circulation. Some of the lack of long-term benefit may be related to delays in epinephrine use. While evidence does not support its use in children, guidelines state its use is reasonable. Lidocaine and amiodarone are also deemed reasonable in children with cardiac arrest who have a shockable rhythm. The general use of sodium bicarbonate or calcium is not recommended.\n\nThe 2010 guidelines from the American Heart Association no longer contain the recommendation for using atropine in pulseless electrical activity and asystole for want of evidence for its use. Neither lidocaine nor amiodarone, in those who continue in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation despite defibrillation, improves survival to hospital discharge but both equally improve survival to hospital admission.\nThrombolytics when used generally may cause harm but may be of benefit in those with a confirmed pulmonary embolism as the cause of arrest. Evidence for use of naloxone in those with cardiac arrest due to opioids is unclear but it may still be used. In those with cardiac arrest due to local anesthetic, lipid emulsion may be used.\n\nCooling adults after cardiac arrest who have a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) but no return of consciousness improves outcomes. This procedure is called targeted temperature management (previously known as therapeutic hypothermia). People are typically cooled for a 24-hour period, with a target temperature of . There are a number of methods used to lower the body temperature, such as applying ice packs or cold-water circulating pads directly to the body, or infusing cold saline. This is followed by gradual rewarming over the next 12 to 24 hrs.\n\nRecent meta-analysis found that the use of therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is associated with improved survival rates and better neurological outcomes.\n\nSome people choose to avoid aggressive measures at the end of life. A do not resuscitate order (DNR) in the form of an advance health care directive makes it clear that in the event of cardiac arrest, the person does not wish to receive cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Other directives may be made to stipulate the desire for intubation in the event of respiratory failure or, if comfort measures are all that are desired, by stipulating that healthcare providers should \"allow natural death\".\n\nSeveral organizations promote the idea of a chain of survival. The chain consists of the following \"links\":\n\nIf one or more links in the chain are missing or delayed, then the chances of survival drop significantly.\n\nThese protocols are often initiated by a code blue, which usually denotes impending or acute onset of cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, although in practice, code blue is often called in less life-threatening situations that require immediate attention from a physician.\n\nResuscitation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation devices has been attempted with better results for in-hospital cardiac arrest (29% survival) than out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (4% survival) in populations selected to benefit most. Cardiac catheterization in those who have survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest appears to improve outcomes although high quality evidence is lacking. It is recommended that it is done as soon as possible in those who have had a cardiac arrest with ST elevation due to underlying heart problems.\n\nThe precordial thump may be considered in those with witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia (including pulseless VT) if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use, but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery or be used in those with unwitnessed out of hospital arrest.\n\nThe overall chance of survival among those who have cardiac arrest outside hospital is 10%. Among those who have an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 70% occur at home and their survival rate is 6%. For those who have an in-hospital cardiac arrest, the survival rate is estimated to be 24%. Among children rates of survival are 3 to 16% in North America. For in hospital cardiac arrest survival to discharge is around 22% with many having a good neurological outcome.\n\nPrognosis is typically assessed 72 hours or more after cardiac arrest. Rates of survival are better in those who someone saw collapse, got bystander CPR, or had either ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation when assessed. Survival among those with Vfib or Vtach is 15 to 23%. Women are more likely to survive cardiac arrest and leave hospital than men.\n\nA 1997 review found rates of survival to discharge of 14% although different studies varied from 0 to 28%. In those over the age of 70 who have a cardiac arrest while in hospital, survival to hospital discharge is less than 20%. How well these individuals are able to manage after leaving hospital is not clear.\n\nA study of survival rates from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest found that 14.6% of those who had received resuscitation by ambulance staff survived as far as admission to hospital. Of these, 59% died during admission, half of these within the first 24 hours, while 46% survived until discharge from hospital. This reflects an overall survival following cardiac arrest of 6.8%. Of these 89% had normal brain function or mild neurological disability, 8.5% had moderate impairment, and 2% had major neurological disability. Of those who were discharged from hospital, 70% were still alive four years later.\n\nBased on death certificates, sudden cardiac death accounts for about 15% of all deaths in Western countries. In the United States 326,000 cases of out of hospital and 209,000 cases of in hospital cardiac arrest occur among adults a year. The lifetime risk is three times greater in men (12.3%) than women (4.2%) based on analysis of the Framingham Heart Study. However this gender difference disappeared beyond 85 years of age.\n\nIn the United States during pregnancy cardiac arrest occurs in about one in twelve thousand deliveries or 1.8 per 10,000 live births. Rates are lower in Canada.\n\nIn many publications the stated or implicit meaning of \"sudden cardiac death\" is sudden death from cardiac causes. However, sometimes physicians call cardiac arrest \"sudden cardiac death\" even if the person survives. Thus one can hear mentions of \"prior episodes of sudden cardiac death\" in a living person.\n\nIn 2006 the American Heart Association presented the following definitions of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death: \"Cardiac arrest is the sudden cessation of cardiac activity so that the victim becomes unresponsive, with no normal breathing and no signs of circulation. If corrective measures are not taken rapidly, this condition progresses to sudden death. Cardiac arrest should be used to signify an event as described above, that is reversed, usually by CPR and/or defibrillation or cardioversion, or cardiac pacing. Sudden cardiac death should not be used to describe events that are not fatal\".\n\nIn some medical facilities, the resuscitation team may purposely respond slowly to a person in cardiac arrest, a practice known as \"slow code\", or may fake the response altogether for the sake of the person's family, a practice known as \"show code\". This is generally done for people for whom performing CPR will have no medical benefit. Such practices are ethically controversial, and are banned in some jurisdictions.\n\n"}

CPH:DOX has since grown to become one of the largest documentary film festivals in Europe with 110.500 admissions in 2018.\n\nCPH:DOX is devoted to supporting independent and innovative film and to present contemporary non-fiction, art cinema and experimental film. The festival has been recognized for its sharp and daring programme profile with a special focus on exploring the hybrid field between documentary practice and various type of staging - sometimes to controversial effect, as when Harmony Korine won the CPH:DOX Award in 2009 for his film \"Trash Humpers\".\n\nBesides its seven international competitions, the festival presents parallel curated and guest curated sections. In recent years, artists and filmmakers such as The xx, Anohni, Harmony Korine, Animal Collective, Nan Goldin, Douglas Gordon, Ben Rivers & Ben Russell, Ai Weiwei, The Yes Men, Olafur Eliasson and Naomi Klein & Avi Lewis have curated film programmes exclusively for CPH:DOX. Parallel to this the festival has been presenting retrospective programmes with among others Phillippe Grandrieux, Nathalie Djurberg, Vincent Moon, Charles Atlas, and James Benning & Sadie Benning, as well as installations and exhibitions film and video artists, among them Michelangelo Frammartino, Keren Cytter and Charles Atlas.\n\nThe festival hosts seminars, debates and events as well as the curated concert series AUDIO:VISUALS, where bands and artists such as Animal Collective, The Knife, John Maus, Nan Goldin & Genesis P-Orridge, Patti Smith, Beach House have been performing to original work created for the occasion by visual artists.\n\nCPH:DOX also presents a number of other initiatives parallel to the festival itself. The industry platform CPH:FORUM, with the attached CPH:MARKET for buyers and programmers, is a financing and co-production forum as well as a networking facility which takes place for three days during the festival. In 2011, the related ART:FILM branch was launched with the aim to facilitate the development and actual production of artists' films in the feature length format. CPH:DOX runs the five-day CPH:Conference as well as the experimental educational course DOX:Academy for students, both of which take place during the festival.\n\nIn 2009, the festival launched the international talent development and film production workshop CPH:LAB (formerly known as DOX:LAB) where around 20 filmmakers are invited each year to develop and direct a film in teams of two. CPH:LAB has been a great success with films premiering and winning prizes at film festivals such as Venice, the Berlinale, Rotterdam, and elsewhere.\n\nFollowing the 2015 edition of CPH:DOX, the festival announced that it would change its dates from November to March, and the first of the new spring editions of the festival was held from March 16–26, 2017, with the centrally located Kunsthal Charlottenborg as the new festival center. The next edition of CPH:DOX is held from March 20–31, 2019.\n\nCPH: DOX is part of the Doc Alliance – a creative partnership between 7 key European documentary film festivals.\n\nJuries hand out prizes in seven international competition programmes:\n\n"}

It mirrors CyberPatriot, the US version run by the Air Force Association. Cyber Centurion is sponsored by Northrop Grumman in an initiative to try and build awareness for cyber security among school children.\n\nCyber Centurion was set up in 2014 after the success of its US counterpart CyberPatriot and its first final took place at The National Museum of Computing on 17 April 2015. The main aim of Cyber Centurion is the same as its US counterpart; to excite, educate and motivate children towards careers in STEM subjects, with an emphasis on Cyber Security. It is also due to the large deficit in Cyber Security professionals. Northrop Grumman, the sponsors of both CyberPatriot and CyberCenturion hope that it will inspire youths towards choosing Cyber Security as a career.\n\nCyberCenturion is split into two age categories, each with four 'tracks'. This is done to encourage more diversity in the competition. The younger age category is for 12-14 year olds and the older category is for 15-18 year olds.\n\nWithin the age categories, the tracks split teams into four more groups, with a boys only track, a girls only track, a mixed team track and a cadet track.\n\nPlaces for the final are awarded in the following number of ways:\n\n\nThere are four main rounds with Rounds 1, 2 and 3 being online qualifying rounds where \"teams will be provided with a mixture of Windows and Linux virtual machines with the aim to find and fix the vulnerabilities along with answering forensics questions\".\n\nRound 4 is the National Finals round, where qualifying teams compete face to face in London to win the top prize.\n\nPrior to the four main rounds, there are four other 'introductory' rounds where teams play but do not score any points. These are as follows:\n\n\n\"\"The competition is played by teams of between four and six people. Each team must include a responsible adult as the liaison between the organisers and the participants, and every team participant must be 18 years old or under when the game is played. The competition is open to anyone in Europe that meets the age requirements and has the correct team format (including leader).\" \"Each team must play a series of online qualifying rounds, which will challenge them to learn about networking, coding and cyber security. If the team scores higher than most of the other players and makes it to the leaderboard, then they will be invited to play in the National Final, a face-to-face competition which finds the ultimate champion for the year\".\"\n\n\nIn CyberCenturion I, the finals were held in Block H, the original home of Colossus, of The National Museum of Computing in April 2015, with KEGS Young Engineering Club at King Edward VI Grammar School in Chelmsford becoming the first CyberCenturion winners and The Chase School, Malvern being the runners up.\n\nIn CyberCenturion II, the finals were held at The National Museum of Computing in April 2016, with \"G-Sec\" from Bayside Comprehensive School, Gibraltar being first-place winners, and the only team from overseas territories to currently have won Cyber Centurion. The top prize was technology equipment to promote help promote STEM in their school.\n\nIn CyberCenturion III, the finals were held at the Institution of Engineering and & Technology in the Maxwell Library in April 2017.\n\n\nIn CyberCenturion IV, the finals were held at the Institution of Engineering & Technology in March 2018.\n\n"}

They are inspired by the Delphic Games of ancient Greece.\n\nOne of the four Panhellenic Games were the Pythian Games in Delphi. Held every four years, they included competitions in athletics, theatre, music, poetry, and painting to praise the god Apollo, the symbol of the Oracle. In the year 394 A.D., Theodosius I, the emperor of the Byzantine Empire banned all Panhellenic Games as being pagan events.\n\nSince 1912 till 1948, on the initiative of Pierre de Coubertin, art competitions at the Summer Olympics were held in various countries. Medals were awarded for works related solely to sport.\n\nThere was also an attempt to revive Pythian Games at the archeological site of Delphi, at the initiative by the Greek poet Angelos Sikelianos and his wife Eva Palmer. In 1927, the first Delphic Festival was held in Greece, but the revival was then abandoned.\n\nNowadays there are so-called Delphi Festivals, which are the closest to their Panhellenic counterparts. They include religious rituals and activities like poetry competition, religious offerings, sports and of course feasting.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was another attempt to restore Delphic Games. Since the 1990s, representatives from Argentina, Austria, China, Cyprus, Ecuador, France, Germany, Greece, Kazakhstan, Libya, Lithuania, Mexico, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, and the United States came together and organized First International Delphic Games, which took place in 2000 in Moscow, Russia (before that the concept was tested out in Tbilisi, Georgia, where First Junior Delphic Games took place.)\n\nCurrently, there are two organizations conducting Delphic Games.\n\nThe International Delphic Council (IDC) with headquarters in Berlin was founded in 1994 at the Schönhausen Palace. Since 1995 the IDC actively supports the creation of the National Delphic organizations. Since 1997 the IDC has organized the International Youth Delphic Games in Georgia, Germany, Philippines, South Africa, as well as, since 2000, the International Delphic Games for adult participants in Russia, Malaysia, South Korea. The IDC held Delphic Games and Junior Delphic Games in the four-year cycle, two years offset from one another, such as the Olympic Games, held at different locations in the world. The International Delphic Games and Congresses receive greetings, patronage and support from various international organizations and celebrities.\n\nA newer organization, International Delphic Committee (IDC) with headquarters in Moscow, was registered in 2004. It organizes International Delphic Games, Youth Delphic Games of Russia and Youth Delphic Games of CIS. Since 2005 the Junior Delphic Games in Russia and the Junior Delphic Games in Commonwealth of Independent States are conducted by the International Delphic Committee. These Junior Delphic Games are dedicated to significant domestic events. This International Delphic Committee conducted also in September 2008 the Second International Delphic Games in Saratov / Russia, but some Saratov Sunday editions and news portals questioned the status and legitimacy of the games.\n\nUnder the patronage of the International Delphic Committee (headquartered in Moscow) and UNESCO, the First Open Youth European Delphic Games were held in Volgograd, Russia, on May 2–7, 2014.\n\n"}

{"id": "5967625", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5967625", "title": "FATF blacklist", "text": "FATF blacklist\n\nThe \"FATF blacklist\" was the common shorthand description for the Financial Action Task Force list of \"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\" (NCCTs). The FATF blacklist or OECD blacklist has been issued by the Financial Action Task Force since 2000 and lists countries which it judges to be non-cooperative in the global fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, calling them \"Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\" (NCCTs). Although non-appearance on the blacklist was perceived to be a mark of approbation for offshore financial centres (or \"tax havens\") who are sufficiently well regulated to meet all of the FATF's criteria, in practice the list included countries that did not operate as offshore financial centres. The FATF updates the blacklist regularly, adding or deleting entries. \n\nFATF was established by the G-7 Summit that was held in Paris in 1989. Founding stakeholders include the G-7 Heads of State or Government, President of the European Commission and eight other countries. \n\nThe term \"non-cooperative\" was criticized by some analysts as misleading, as a number of countries on the list simply lacked the infrastructure or resources to cope with relatively sophisticated financial criminals who tried to operate there. Since 2008 the FATF has, at the behest of G20 leaders, installed a more analytical process of identifying jurisdictions deficient in their anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regimes. \nOne of the main objectives of the FATF is to establish norms and standards of “legal, regulatory and operational measures” to fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the security and integrity of the international financial system. However, FATF “has no investigative authority.” FATF works with nation-states to bring legislative changes and regulatory reforms in aforementioned sectors. In addition, FAFT also provides policy recommendations that meet international standards to countries for combating “money laundering and the financing of terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. FATF has been providing policy recommendations since 1990 and their recommendations have revised four times since then. FATF also monitors the situations of its members in establishing adequate measures and institutions to fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. FATF also makes sure that it is aware of national-level vulnerabilities of its member states “with the aim of protecting the international financial system from misuse.” \n\nAccording to its official website, there are 37 member of FATF, representing most financial centres around the world. \n\nThere are currently four FATF observers. \n\nThe initial list of fifteen countries regarded as uncooperative in the fight against money laundering, was published in June 2000. The list met criticism from professionals experienced in the offshore financial sector. The designation of the Cayman Islands as non-cooperative was thought to be harsh, particularly as the 2000 report itself acknowledged that \"the Cayman Islands has been a leader in developing anti-money laundering programmes throughout the Caribbean region. It has served as president of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, and it has provided substantial assistance to neighbouring states in the region. It has demonstrated cooperation on criminal law enforcement matters, and uncovered several serious cases of fraud and money laundering otherwise unknown to authorities in FATF member states.\"\nThe list consisted of the following countries:\nThe second FATF report, published in 2001 and including a supplemental report in September, denoted a further eight countries as non-cooperative:\n\nAccording to June 2002 report from FATF, following countries were listed as NCCTs. \n\nAccording to June 2003 report from FATF, the following countries were listed as NCCTs. \n\nAccording to July 2004 report form FATF, the following countries were listed as NCCTs. \n\nAccording to June 2005 report from FATF, the following were listed as NCCTs. \n\nThe seventh list, published in June 2006, listed only the following country as non-cooperative:\n\nFATF's Eighth NCCT Review (Annual Review of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories 2006–2007, dated 12 October 2007) listed no countries as non-cooperative. Myanmar (formerly Burma) was removed on 13 October 2006, Nauru on 13 October 2005 and Nigeria on 23 June 2006.\n\nFATF identified Uzbekistan, Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and São Tomé and Principe, and the northern part of Cyprus as high risk and non-cooperative.\n\nFATF issued a \"Public statement\" on 25 February 2009 noting concerns and encouraging greater compliance by the following countries:\n\nThe following country has not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or has not committed to an action plan developed with the FATF to address the deficiencies. \n\nThe following countries have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan developed with the FATF to address the deficiencies. \n\nA total of 23 countries were committed to, but had not yet implemented the FATF standard.\n\nCountries committed and addressing AML/CFT deficiencies\nCountries committed, but not making sufficient progress\n\nA total of 17 countries were labeled as high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions by FATF. All listed countries below are defined as such; counter-measures were in force only for Iran and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, North Korea).\n\nHigh-risk and non-cooperative countries, to whom counter-measures applied: \n\nHigh-risk and non-cooperative countries, not committed to an action plan:\nA total of 14 countries were identified as jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.\n\nJurisdictions subject to a FATF call on its members and other jurisdictions to apply counter-measures to protect the international financial system from the ongoing and substantial money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks emanating from the jurisdictions.\n\nJurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan.\n\nA total of 13 countries were identified as jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.\n\nJurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan. \nA total of 11 countries were identified as jurisdictions with strategic deficiencies posing a risk to the international financial system.\n\nJurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan.\n\nA total of 6 countries were identified as jurisdictions that have strategic deficiencies that pose a risk to the international financial system.\n\nJurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies that have not made sufficient progress in addressing the deficiencies or have not committed to an action plan.\n\nThe FATF identified following countries which have made significant progress in improving its AML/CFT regime and noted that these countries have established the legal and regulatory framework to meet its commitments in its action plan regarding the strategic deficiencies that the FATF had identified. The following countries are therefore no longer subject to the FATF’s monitoring process under its on-going global AML/CFT compliance process..\nThe FATF statement issued on 23 October 2015 identified three high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions:\n\nCall to apply counter-measures:\n\nJurisdictions with strategic deficiencies:\n\nThe FATF statement from 19 February 2016 dropped Panama from its gray list, but there is still the OECD Myanmar from the list identifying two high-risk and non-cooperative jurisdictions:\n\nCall to apply counter-measures:\n\nRegarding with North Korea, the FATF released the following concern: \n\n“The FATF remains concerned by the DPRK’s failure to address the significant deficiencies in its anti‑money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and the serious threat this poses to the integrity of the international financial system. The FATF urges the DPRK to immediately and meaningfully address its AML/CFT deficiencies. Further, FATF has serious concerns with the threat posed by DPRK’s illicit activities related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and its financing.” \n\n\nAlthough its main focus is on tax crime, the OECD is also concerned with money laundering and has complemented the work carried out by the FATF.\n\nThe OECD has maintained a 'blacklist' of countries it considers \"uncooperative tax havens\" in the drive for transparency of tax affairs and the effective exchange of information, officially called \"The List of Uncooperative Tax Havens\". Since May 2009, no countries were officially listed as uncooperative tax havens in the light of their commitments to implement the OECD standards.\n\nOn 22 October 2008, at an OECD meeting in Paris, 17 countries led by France and Germany decided to draw up a new blacklist of tax havens. It had been asked to investigate around 40 new tax havens where undeclared revenue was hidden and which hosted many of the non-regulated hedge funds that came under fire during the financial crisis of 2007–08. Germany, France, and other countries called on the OECD to add Switzerland to a blacklist of countries which encourage tax fraud. On 2 April 2009, the OECD published a list of countries, divided into three parts depending on whether they implemented an \"internationally agreed tax standard\", in select jurisdictions – tax havens or other financial centers of interest.\n\nThe Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes reviews and issues reports on compliance of its member tax jurisdictions. The Global Forum's peer review process examines both the legal and regulatory aspects of exchange (Phase 1 reviews) and the exchange of information in practice (Phase 2).\n\n\n"}

It is normally of the essence of a fair that it is temporary with scheduled times lasting from an afternoon to several weeks.\n\nVariations of fairs include:\n\nThe Roman fairs were holidays on which there was an intermission of labour and pleadings. In the Roman provinces of Judea and Syria Palaestina, Jewish rabbis prohibited Jews from participating in fairs in certain towns because the religious nature of the fairs contravened the prescribed practice of Judaism.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, many fairs developed as temporary markets and were especially important for long-distance and international trade, as wholesale traders travelled, sometimes for many days, to fairs where they could be sure to meet those they needed to buy from or sell to. Fairs were usually tied to a special Christian religious occasions, such as the Saint's day of the local church. Stagshaw in England, is documented to have held annual fairs as early as 1293 consisting of the sales of animals. Along with the main fair held on 4 July, the city also hosted smaller fairs throughout the year where specific types of animals were sold, such as one for horses, one for lambs, and one for ewes.\n\nThe Kumbh Mela, held every twelve years, at Allahabad, Haridwar, Nashik, and Ujjain is one of the largest fairs in India, where more than 60 million people gathered in January 2001, making it the largest gathering anywhere in the world. \"Kumbha\" means a pitcher and \"Mela\" means \"fair\" in Sanskrit.\n\nIn the United States, fairs draw in as many as 150 million people each summer. Children's competitions at an American fair range from breeding small animals to robotics, whilst the organization 4-H has become a traditional association.\n\nBecause of the great numbers of people attracted by fairs they were often the scenes of riots and disturbances, so the privilege of holding a fair was granted by royal charter. At first, they were allowed only in towns and places of strength, or where there was a bishop, sheriff or governor who could keep order. In time various benefits became attached to certain fairs, such as granting people the protection of a holiday and allowing them freedom from arrest in certain circumstances. The officials were authorized to mete out justice to those who came to their fair; eventually even the smallest fair would have had a court to adjudicate on offences and disputes arising within the fairground, called a \"pye powder\" court (from Old French \"pieds pouldres\", literally \"dusty feet\", meaning an itinerant trader, from Medieval Latin \"pedes pulverosi\").\n\nThe chaotic nature of the Stagshaw Bank Fair with masses of people and animals and stalls inspired the Newcastle colloquialism \"like a Stagey Bank Fair\" to describe a general mess.\n\nThe American county fair is featured in E. B. White's \"Charlotte's Web\".\n\n"}

They often cause cut-type injuries. \n\nFlying glass resulting from an explosion poses a significant risk in the event; up to 85% of injuries from an explosion are due to flying glass.\nSeverity of injury from flying glass depends on the peak overpressure of the blast. Potential for injury has been derived from both experiments and theoretical modeling of blast effects. Among the important features in models of flying glass are breaking pressure, velocity and distribution of flying fragments, fragment shape, and the distance traveled until impact. Mitigation strategies, such as the use of window glazing or laminated glass can reduce flying glass injuries.\n"}

The theatre opened in 1831, and closed in about 1881. The theatre was named for the actor, David Garrick, who had made his début at the nearby Goodman's Fields Theatre on 9 October 1741, playing the role of \"Richard III\".\n\nThe performance on 11 May 1840 was \"Marie!\" and \"Virginius the Rum’un!\", from an existent playbill. The plays were probably melodramas and some indication of the fare available at the time.\n\nThe first theatre burned down in 1846, and was rebuilt to open as \"The Albert and Garrick Royal Amphitheatre\". During rebuilding from 1852-1854, the neighbour, a gun manufacturer, obtained an injunction against the proprietor, Lawrence Levy, to restrict the height of the adjacent wall so as not to impede light to his premises. The theatre was managed by Lawrence Levy from 1854 until 1864. He returned to manage the theatre between 1867 and 1868. In 1856 E.B. Gaston was Stage Manager. The second theatre had a capacity of 462, although when Lawrence Levy put the theatre up for sale in 1866-1868, he claimed it \"will hold 1,600 persons\" and \"can be made to hold 2,500\", and then in 1868 was claiming \"Was built for a circus\" and \"Holds 1,700 persons; can be made for 8,000\".\n\nA young Barney Barnato is reputed to have begged pass outs from theatre leavers, to sell them on to others for a halfpenny\n\nAfter actor-manager J. B. Howe's bankruptcy in 1875, the theatre remained empty until 1879. Actress-manageress May Bulmer then ran the theatre until it was demolished, having a personal success in the light opera \"A Cruise to China\". Although Lawrence Levy had died in 1873, the theatre was still part of his estate in 1882 when his trustee testified at the Old Bailey in the trial of two men called Culver and Jacobs. They had been claiming to hold the lease of the theatre, and had fraudulently been taking payments from actors on the promise of providing them with engagements. The site of the theatre is today occupied by the old Leman Street Police Station, built in 1891.\n"}

{"id": "13458963", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13458963", "title": "Konpira Grand Theatre", "text": "Konpira Grand Theatre\n\nThe Konpira Grand Theatre (金毘羅大芝居 \"Konpira Ōshibai\"), also known as the Kanamaru-za (金丸座) is a restored Kabuki theatre in Kotohira, Kagawa, on the island of Shikoku, Japan. It was originally constructed in 1835, and is the oldest kabuki theatre in Japan. Kabuki plays are performed for one month each year, usually in April.\n\nThe theatre was originally built in 1835 and 1836, and takes its name from the nearby Kompira Shrine which is in turn named after the Hindu/Buddhist deity Kumbhira to which the shrine is dedicated. Prior to its construction, small temporary theatres were frequently built on the site, and doubled as lottery halls. The design was based on that of the Ōnishi Theatre of Osaka, and the construction costs, amounting to roughly 1000 \"ryō\", were raised by the local geisha community.\n\nThe theatre was originally controlled by the Kanemitsu-in, a local Buddhist temple, but in 1877 came to be owned by a man by the name of Kyōhō, an \"otokodate\", wealthy merchant, gang leader, and head of the local fire brigade. He changed the name of the theatre to the Inari-za (named after the Shintō deity Inari), and ran full-day programs as many other major theatres throughout the country began to cut down and only show selected scenes for a few hours a day. The theatre was purchased in 1897 by a man by the name of Kawazoe Sadaji, who changed its name to Chitose-za (One Thousand Years Theatre), and sold it three years later. Kanamaru Genjirō thus obtained the theater in 1900, for 4500 yen, and renamed it once again, to the Kanamaru-za, a name which continues to be used today.\n\nAfter falling into disuse for many years, and being used as a movie theater for some time, the theatre was designated an Important Cultural Property by the Agency for Cultural Affairs of the national government in 1970, after having been designated as such by the prefecture in 1953. Following a fund-raising drive which raised over US$2 million, the theatre was restored in 1976 to its Edo period appearance and moved some 200 meters to a new location.\n\nIn late June 1985, a troupe led by Nakamura Kichiemon II and Sawamura Sōjūrō IX performed the play \"Saikai Zakura Misome no Kiyomizu\" (\"Reunion Amongst the Cherry Blossoms After the First Meeting at Kiyomizu\") and dance drama \"Niwakajishi\" (\"Spirited Lion\"), at the Kanamaru-za, in a three-day stint following performances at the Naka-za in Osaka. Kichiemon was impressed with the theatre's atmosphere and traditional design and amenities, and encouraged other actors to journey to Kotohira. A month-long program has been produced every spring since, featuring major Tokyo/Osaka actors.\n\nMuch of the 1995 film \"Sharaku\", set in 1790s Edo and revolving around the life of \"ukiyo-e\" artist Sharaku, was filmed at the Konpira Theatre, which stood in for the no longer extant Nakamura-za.\n\nThe structure's frontage is about 80 feet long, or 13 \"ken\" and 2 \"shaku\" in the now no longer used traditional Japanese units of measurement. During the month when kabuki actors journey down from Tokyo or Kamigata (the Kyoto-Osaka area) and perform at the theatre, large banners bearing the crest of the Shōchiku company, and signboards with the stars' names are displayed. Fake bushels of rice, representing gifts from fans and sponsors, are also situated outside the theatre.\n\nThere are three entrances into the building. The ones on the left and right are of normal size, but the central entrance, called the , is quite small and requires one to crouch in order to enter. This was an effective form of crowd control in the Edo period, and, along with armed guards, helped prevent anyone from entering without a ticket. While the average commoner playgoer had to use this small \"nezumi kido\", those associated with the Kanemitsu-in used the \"goyō kido\" on the right. The large \"ōkido\" on the left was used by members of the samurai class, and others of importance.\n\nOne of the primary features distinguishing the renovated Konpira Grand Theatre other kabuki theatres in Japan today, which are more modern in style, is the \"tatami\" floor in the main (orchestra section) seating section. Areas of seating for small parties are divided from one another by a grid of wooden planking, into box seats called \"masu\"; sitting this way allows greater range of motion for the viewer, and thus allows one to more easily turn to watch action on the \"hanamichi\", the long stage extension which runs from the stage to the back of the theater. A raised \"tatami\" platform called the \"sajiki\" runs along the left side of the theatre on both the ground and second floors; these were traditionally the most expensive seats, and still are today. A similar section which runs along the right side of the theatre is called the \"demago\", though traditionally this would have been called the \"takadoma\" in Edo.\n\nAnother distinguishing feature is the \"karaido\", or \"empty well\", a space between the \"hanamichi\" and stage accessible from underneath by stairs; while most other theatres utilize an elevator trap called a \"suppon\" (\"snapping turtle\") to allow actors to enter directly onto the \"hanamichi\", the stairs allow an actor to better time his entrance, for better dramatic effect. The Konpira Grand Theatre has a \"suppon\" as well, but scholar Samuel Leiter writes that he is unaware of another active theatre which uses a \"karaido\". A second \"hanamichi\", called the \"kari hanamichi\" and about half the width of the main \"hanamichi\", runs through the theatre towards the right side; a connecting plank is sometimes used to allow actors to cross between the two \"hanamichi\" at some distance from the stage.\n\nMuch of the left and right walls of the seating area are composed of \"shōji\" panels, which can be slid like sliding doors to provide access to corridors which run outside the seating area. The outermost side walls of the theatre building, forming the opposite side of these corridors, consist of rain shutters known as \"madobuta\" (\"window lids\") or \"akarimado\" (\"lighting windows\") which can be raised and lowered by stagehands to let the sunlight in and control the lighting of the theatre, in order to create atmospheric effects, such as a dark and spooky atmosphere for certain elements of ghost plays.\n\nThere are areas for musicians on both stage left and right, along with a second-story room above stage left, called the \"yuka\", used specifically by \"tayū\" (narrative chanters) and shamisen players heard in plays deriving from the \"jōruri\" puppet theatre. This is in contrast to the theatres of Tokyo and Kamigata, which traditionally have boxes for the musicians on only one side of the stage (stage right and left respectively). The stage itself is about half the width of that in the modern theatres; while the stage opening at Kabuki-za in Tokyo is nearly ninety feet wide, the space between the supporting pillars at the Kanamaru-za is eight \"ken\", or roughly 48 feet; Leiter calls the larger scale of the more modern theatres a loss and an artistic weakening, as theatres moved \"away from the most effective means for expressing theatrical art.\"\n\nThe Kanamaru-za also boasts a manually operated rotating stage (\"mawari butai\") and trap doors (\"seri\"), though the \"hell\" (\"naraku\") area underneath the stage from which these were operated was considered by many actors so unpleasant that it would often be avoided in favor of the corridors outside the \"sajiki\" (along the sides of the theatre) as a means for traveling around the theatre.\n\n"}

It was the first spacecraft to reach the surface of the Moon, and the first man-made object to land on another celestial body. On September 13, 1959, it hit the Moon's surface east of Mare Imbrium near the craters Aristides, Archimedes, and Autolycus.\n\nLaunch was scheduled for September 9, but the Blok I core stage was shut down after it failed to reach full thrust at ignition. The booster was removed from the pad and replaced by a different vehicle, delaying the flight by three days. \"Luna 2\", like \"Luna 1\", took a direct path to the Moon, with a velocity high enough to result in a travel time of around 36 hours. \"Luna 2\" hit the Moon about from the centre of the visible disk on 1959 September 13 at 21:02:24 UTC.\n\n\"Luna 2\" was similar in design to \"Luna 1\", a spherical spacecraft with protruding antennas and instrumentation. The instrumentation was also similar to Luna 1, including scintillation counters, geiger counters, a magnetometer, Cherenkov detectors, and micrometeorite detectors. There were no propulsion systems on \"Luna 2\" itself.\n\nOnce \"Luna 2\" was split from its upper stage it started transmitting information back to Earth using three different transmitters. These transmitters provided precise information on its course, allowing scientists to calculate that \"Luna 2\" would hit its mark on the Moon around 00:05 on September 14 (Moscow Time).\nIn order to be able to provide a visual from Earth on September 13, the spacecraft released a vapor cloud that would expand to diameter that would be seen by observatories in Alma Ata, Byurakan, Abastumani, Tbilisi, and Stalinabad. This vapor cloud also acted as an experiment to see how the sodium gas would act in a vacuum and zero gravity.\n\nThe last stage of the rocket that carried \"Luna 2\" did not carry any type of tracking device so there was uncertainty as to where it landed, but it did hit the Moon surface about 30 minutes after \"Luna 2\" hit.\n\nFor a time, Americans were starting to believe that they were making progress in the space race and that although the Soviets might have had larger rockets, the United States had better guidance systems. This myth was busted after the Soviets were able to crash \"Luna 2\" onto the Moon. At that time the closest Americans had come to the Moon was about with Pioneer 4. Khrushchev, on his only visit to the U.S., gave president Eisenhower a replica of the Soviet pennants that \"Luna 2\" had just placed onto the lunar surface.\n\"Luna 2\" and its predecessors all came to be used throughout the USSR and around the world as pro-communist propaganda. Donald W. Cox explains, in his book \"The Space Race\", “Although the Sputniks and Luniks did not themselves provide better cars, refrigerators, color TV sets, and homes for the peasants and laborers of the Soviet Union and her satellite states, they did evoke added inspiration for the earthbound followers of the communist way of life helping to take their minds off shortages of consumer goods. The people were spurred on to work just a little harder for the glorious motherland and to outstrip the west in the less dramatic and more basic things of life, like coal and steel production.”\nAlthough \"Luna 2\" was a success for the Soviets, it also helped the U.S. by starting a trend of crash landing. It would eventually lead to the U.S.-made Rangers which would go on to also crash land on the Moon in exactly the same way. Crash landing proved useful even after soft landing was mastered. NASA used crash landings to test whether Moon craters contained ice by crashing space probes into craters and testing the debris that got thrown out.\n\n\"Luna 2\" carried 5 different instruments to conduct various tests while it was on its way to the Moon. The scintillation counters would be used to measure any ionizing radiation; the Cherenkov radiation detectors would be measuring for electromagnetic radiation caused by charged particles. “The Geiger Counter carried on \"Luna 2\" had the primary scientific objective of determining the electron spectrum of the outer radiation belt. The instrument consisted of three STS-5 gas-discharge counters mounted on the outside of the hermetically sealed container, and would be powered by a 360 V battery”. The last instrument on Luna 2 was, “a three component fluxgate magnetometer similar to that used on Luna 1 but with the dynamic range reduced by a factor of 4 to -750 to +750 gammas so that the quantization uncertainty was -12 to +12 gammas.” Together the devices were searching for lunar magnetic and radiation fields similar to the Van Allen radiation belt around Earth, sending information about once every minute until its last transmission which came about 55 km away from the lunar surface. Although it did prove previous measurements of the Van Allen radiation belts that were taken from Luna 1 around the Earth, it was not able to detect any type of radiation belts around the Moon. Because of claims that information received from Luna 1 was fake, as soon as the scientists of \"Luna 2\" started receiving transmissions they sent out the intended time of impact, and the transmission and trajectory details. Even though Soviet scientists gave all this information, the Americans were still skeptical until Bernard Lovell was able to prove that the radio signal was coming from \"Luna 2\" by showing the Doppler shift from its transmissions. After this no one seemed to question the veracity of the Soviets.\n\n\"Luna 2\" showed time variations in the electron flux and energy spectrum in the Van Allen radiation belt.\n\nThe spacecraft also carried Soviet pennants. Two of them, located in the spacecraft, were sphere-shaped, with the surface covered by identical pentagonal elements. In the center was an explosive charge designed to shatter the sphere, sending the pentagonal shields in all directions. This was a low-tech method that would blow back a few elements in the direction opposite of its velocity vector to greatly reduce the energy upon reaching the surface (in the way that landers are designed to reduce velocity) which would improve the chance that some part of the sphere might survive the impact. Each pentagonal element was made of stainless steel and had the USSR Coat of Arms and the Cyrillic letters \"СССР\" (\"USSR\") engraved on one side, and the words \"СССР январь 1959\" (\"USSR January 1959\") on the other side. They most likely vaporized on impact, however. The third pennant was located in the last stage of the \"Luna 2\" rocket, which collided with the Moon's surface 30 minutes after the spacecraft did. It was a capsule filled with liquid, with aluminium strips placed into it. On each of these strips the USSR Coat of Arms, the words \"1959 январь\" (\"1959 January\"), and the words \"СОЮЗ СОВЕТСКИХ СОЦИАЛИСТИЧЕСКИХ РЕСПУБЛИК\" (English: \"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\") were engraved.\n\nOn September 15, 1959, the premier of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, presented the American president Dwight D. Eisenhower with a copy of the spherical pennant as a gift. That sphere is kept at the Eisenhower Presidential Library and Museum in Abilene, Kansas. The only other known copy of the spherical pennant is located at the Kansas Cosmosphere in Hutchinson, Kansas.\n\n\n"}

The Moderates were never a formal party, but only a movement of liberal-minded reformist patriots, usually secular, from politics, military, literature and philosophy.\n\nSince the Congress of Vienna, inside the Italian Peninsula was diffused a reformist and Romantic moment, inspired from Jacobonism and Bonapartism and explosed in the revolutions of 1820 against the reactionary Congress System. Many patriots, soldiers and intellectuals who took part to the revolutions were definited \"moderates\". \n\nThe Moderates, with time, demarcated themselves from radical and republican organizations like Giuseppe Mazzini's Young Italy, \"Carboneria\" and others. The moderates and radicals disputed mainly for the methods to unified Italy: the Moderates supported secret pacts and strategic alliances between the patriotic movement and the other European powers, whereas the Mazzini's supporters called a popular revolution to establish a democratic Republic. \nAfter the failure of the Italian Revolutions of 1848, attempted by Mazzinians and republicans, the republican ideas declined for the Moderates' agenda.\nDuring this time, several politicians of other Italian states are members of the group: in the Kingdom of Sardinia, the leaders were Massimo d'Azeglio and Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, representing the parliamentary Right, and Urbano Rattazzi, representing the Left; in the Papal States the reform movement was headed by Terenzio della Rovere and Pellegrino Rossi, the last murdered by a republican plot in 1848; in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies prominent moderates were brothers Bertrando and Silvio Spaventa.\nWhen the Kingdom of Italy was founded in 1861, the moderates merged in the Historical Right and Left, the two Piedmontese parliamentary group that monopolized the politics of the new Italian state for almost half-century.\n\nDifferently by democrats and radical republicans, the Moderates were only circles of intellectuals, aristocrats, soldiers and businessmen with patriotic tendencies. However, the Moderate Party wasn't cohesive, because its members were of different political ideologies, from continental liberalism to soft conservatism. Initially, the party wasn't too nationalist, preferring a federation or coalition between the several Italian states, and support both reformist and law and order policies, different by the republicans like Mazzini.\nWhen the possibility of an unified Italian state became real, a new question of division was the form that the new Italian State would have. Someone, like Vincenzo Gioberti, supported a confederation of states, led by the Pope. other simply claimed for a centralized state headed by a monarch, without differences if a Savoy or other.

{"id": "21657843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21657843", "title": "Papua conflict", "text": "Papua conflict\n\nThe Papua conflict is an ongoing conflict between the Indonesian government and portions of the indigenous populations of Western New Guinea (Papua) in the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua on the island of New Guinea in which the Indonesian government has been accused of conducting a genocidal campaign against the indigenous inhabitants. Since the withdrawal of the Dutch colonial administration from the Netherlands New Guinea in 1962, the implementation of Indonesian governance in 1963 and the formal absorption of Papua into Indonesia in 1969, the Free Papua Movement (, a militant Papuan-independence organisation, has conducted a low-key guerrilla war against Indonesia through the targeting of its military and police, and engages in the kidnapping of Papuan Indonesian settlers and foreigners.\n\nThe Papuans have conducted various protests and ceremonies raising their flag for independence or federation with Papua New Guinea, and accuse the Indonesian government of indiscriminate violence and of suppressing their freedom of expression. Over 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 and the Indonesian governance style has been compared to that of a police state, suppressing freedom of political association and political expression. Indonesia continues to restrict foreign access to the region due to sensitivities regarding its suppression of Papuan nationalism.\n\nIn December 1949, at the end of the Indonesian National Revolution, the Netherlands agreed to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over the territories of the former Dutch East Indies, with the exception of Western New Guinea, which the Dutch continued to hold as Netherlands New Guinea. The nationalist Indonesian government argued that it was the successor state to the whole of the Dutch East Indies and wanted to end the Dutch colonial presence in the archipelago. The Netherlands argued that the Papuans were ethnically different and that the Netherlands would continue to administer the territory until it was capable of self-determination. From 1950 onwards, the Dutch and the Western powers agreed that the Papuans should be given an independent state, but due to global considerations, mainly the Kennedy administration's concern to keep Indonesia on their side of the Cold War, the United States pressured the Dutch to sacrifice Papua's independence and transfer the territory to Indonesia.\n\nIn 1962, the Dutch agreed to relinquish the territory to temporary United Nations administration, signing the New York Agreement, which included a provision that a plebiscite would be held before 1969. The Indonesian military organised this vote, called the Act of Free Choice in 1969 to determine the population's views on the territory's future; the result was in favor of integration into Indonesia. In violation of the Agreement between Indonesia and the Netherlands, the vote was a show of hands in the presence of the Indonesian military, and only involved 1025 hand picked people who were forced at gunpoint to vote for integration, much less than 1% of those who should have been eligible to vote. The legitimacy of the vote is hence disputed by independence activists who protest the military occupation of Papua by Indonesia. Indonesia is regularly accused of human rights abuses. They include attacks on OPM-sympathetic civilians and jailing people who raise West Papua's national Morning Star flag for treason.\n\nThrough the transmigration program, which since 1969 includes migration to Papua, about half of the 2.4 million inhabitants of Indonesian Papua are born in Java. intermarriage is increasing and the offspring of trans-migrants have come to see themselves as \"Papuan\" over their parents' ethnic group. As of 2010, 13,500 Papuan refugees live in exile in the neighbouring Papua New Guinea (PNG), and occasionally, the fighting spills over the border. As a result, the Papua New Guinea Defence Force has set up patrols along PNG's western border to prevent infiltration by the OPM. Additionally, the PNG government has been expelling resident \"border crossers\" and making a pledge of no anti-Indonesian activity a condition for migrants' stay in PNG. Since the late 1970s, the OPM have made retaliatory \"threats against PNG business projects and politicians for the PNGDF's operations against the OPM\". The PNGDF has performed joint border patrols with Indonesia since the 1980s, although the PNGDF's operations against the OPM are \"parallel\".\n\nPrior to the arrival of the Dutch, two Indonesian principalities known as the Sultanate of Tidore and the Sultanate of Ternate claimed dominion over Western New Guinea. In 1660, the Dutch recognized the Sultan of Tidore's sovereignty over New Guinea. It thus became notionally Dutch as the Dutch held power over Tidore. A century later, in 1793, Britain attempted a failed settlement near Manokwari. After almost 30 years, in 1824 Britain and the Netherlands agreed to divide the land; rendering the eastern half of the island as being under British control and the western half would become part of the Dutch East Indies. \n\nIn 1828, the Dutch established a settlement in Lobo (near Kaimana) which also failed. Almost 30 years later, the Germans established the first missionary settlement on an island near Manokwari. While in 1828 the Dutch claimed the south coast west of the 141st meridian and the north coast west of Humboldt Bay in 1848, Dutch activity in New Guinea was minimal until 1898 when the Dutch established an administrative center, which was subsequently followed by missionaries and traders. Under Dutch rule, commercial links were developed between West New Guinea and Eastern Indonesia. In 1883, New Guinea was divided between the Netherlands, Britain, and Germany; with Australia occupying the German territory in 1914. In 1901, the Netherlands formally purchased West New Guinea from the Sultanate of Tidore, incorporating it into the Dutch East Indies. During World War II, the territory was occupied by Japan but was later recaptured by the Allies, who restored Dutch rule.\n\nFour years after the Indonesian National Revolution and Independence on 17 August 1945, the Netherlands formally transferred sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia, the successor state to the Dutch East Indies, on 27 December 1949. However, the Dutch refused to include Netherlands New Guinea in the new Indonesian Republic and decided to assist and prepare it for independence as a separate country. In order to resolve the differences, both countries held the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference in late 1949 but to no avail. It was decided that the present status quo of the territory would be maintained and then negotiated bilaterally one year after the date of the transfer of sovereignty.\n\nA year later, both Indonesia and the Netherlands were still unable to resolve their differences, which led Indonesian President Sukarno to accuse the Dutch of reneging on their promises to negotiate the handover of the territory. The Dutch was persistent in their argument that the territory did not belong to Indonesia because the Melanesian Papuans were ethnically and geographically different from Indonesians, and that the territory had always been administrated separately. On top of that, the Papuans did not participate in the Indonesian Revolution, and that the Papuans did not want to be under Indonesian control. \n\nWhile at face-value, the Dutch seems to be having the Papuans’ interest at heart, Arend Lijphart, a Dutch political scientist disagreed. He argued that other underlying Dutch motives to prevent West New Guinea from joining Indonesia included the territory's lucrative economic resources, its strategic importance as a Dutch naval base, and its potential role for housing the Netherlands' surplus population including Eurasians who had become displaced by the Indonesian National Revolution. The Dutch also wanted to maintain a regional presence and to secure their economic interests in Indonesia.\n\nOn the other hand, Indonesia regarded West New Guinea as an intrinsic part of the country on the basis that Indonesia was the successor state to the Dutch East Indies. These sentiments were reflected in the popular Indonesian revolutionary slogan “Indonesia Merdeka- dari Sabang sampai Merauke” \"Indonesia Free—from Sabang to Merauke. The slogan indicates the stretch of Indonesian territory from the most western part in Sumatra, Sabang, and the most eastern part in Merauke, a small city in West New Guinea. Indonesian irredentist sentiments were also inflamed by the fact that several Indonesian political prisoners had been interned at a remote prison camp north of Merauke called Boven-Digoel prior to World War II. Sukarno also contended that the continuing Dutch presence in West New Guinea was an obstacle to the process of nation-building in Indonesia and that it would also encourage secessionist movements.\n\nThe Netherlands and Indonesia tried to resolve the West New Guinea dispute through several bilateral negotiations between 1950 and 1953. These negotiations ended up to become unsuccessful and led the two governments to harden their stance and position. On 15 February 1952, the Dutch Parliament voted to incorporate New Guinea into the realm of the Netherlands and shortly after, the Netherlands refused further discussion on the question of sovereignty and considered the issue to be closed. In response, President Sukarno adopted a more forceful stance towards the Dutch. Initially, he unsuccessfully tried to force the Indonesian government to abrogate the Round Table agreements and to adopt economic sanctions but was rebuffed by the Natsir Cabinet. Undeterred by this setback, Sukarno made recovering the territory a top priority of his presidency and sought to harness popular support from the Indonesian public for this goal throughout many of his speeches between 1951 and 1952.\n\nBy 1953, the dispute had become the central issue in Indonesian domestic politics. All political parties across the political spectrum, particularly the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), supported Sukarno's efforts to integrate the territory into Indonesia. According to historians Audrey and George McTurnan Kahin, the PKI's pro-integration stance helped the party to rebuild its political base and to further its credentials as a nationalist Communist Party that supported Sukarno.\n\nIn 1954, Indonesia decided to take the dispute to the United Nations and succeeded in having it placed on the agenda for the upcoming ninth session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In response, the Dutch Ambassador to the United Nations, Herman van Roijen, warned that the Netherlands would ignore any recommendations which might be made by the UN regarding the dispute. During the Bandung Conference in April 1955, Indonesia succeeded in securing a resolution supporting its claim to West New Guinea from African and Asian countries. In addition, Indonesia was also supported by the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies.\n\nIn terms of international support, the Netherlands was supported by the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and several Western European and Latin American countries. However, these countries were unwilling to commit to providing military support in the event of a conflict with Indonesia. The Eisenhower administration were open to non-violent territorial changes but rejected the use of any military means to resolve the dispute. Until 1961, the United States pursued a policy of strict neutrality and abstained on every vote on the dispute. According to the historian Nicholas Tarling, the United Kingdom took the position that it was \"strategically undesirable\" for control of the territory to pass to Indonesia because it created a precedent for encouraging territorial changes based on political prestige and geographical proximity.\n\nThe Australian Menzies government welcomed the Dutch presence in the region as an \"essential link\" in its national defense since it also administrated a trust territory in the eastern half of New Guinea. Unlike the Labor Party which had supported the Indonesian nationalists, the Prime Minister Robert Menzies viewed Indonesia as a potential threat to its national security and distrusted the Indonesian leadership for supporting Japan during World War II. In addition, New Zealand and South Africa also opposed Indonesia's claim to the territory. New Zealand accepted the Dutch argument that the Papuans were culturally different from the Indonesians and thus supported maintaining Dutch sovereignty over the territory until the Papuans were ready for self-rule. By contrast, newly independent India, another Commonwealth member supported Indonesia's position.\nBetween 1954 and 1957, Indonesia and their Afro-Asian allies made three attempts to get the United Nations to intervene. All these three resolutions, however, failed to gain a two–thirds majority in the UNGA. On 30 November 1954, the Indian representative Krishna Menon initiated a resolution calling for Indonesia and the Netherlands to resume negotiations and to report to the 10th UNGA Session. This resolution was sponsored by eight countries (Argentina, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Syria, and Yugoslavia) but failed to secure a two-thirds majority (34-23-3). In response to growing tensions between Jakarta and the Hague, Indonesia unilaterally dissolved the Netherlands-Indonesian Union on 13 February 1956, and also rescinded compensation claims to the Dutch. Undeterred by this setback, Indonesia resubmitted the dispute to the UNGA agenda in November 1965.\n\nOn 23 February 1957, a 13 country–sponsored resolution (Bolivia, Burma, Ceylon, Costa Rica, Ecuador, India, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, and Yugoslavia) calling for the United Nations to appoint a \"good offices commission\" for West New Guinea was submitted to the UNGA. Despite receiving a plural majority (40-25-13), this second resolution failed to gain a two-thirds majority. Undeterred, the Afro-Asian caucus in the United Nations lobbied for the dispute to be included on the UNGA agenda. On 4 October 1957, Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio warned that Indonesia would embark on \"another cause\" if the United Nations failed to bring about a solution to the dispute that favoured Indonesia. That month, the PKI and affiliated trade unions lobbied for retaliatory economic measures against the Dutch. On 26 November 1957, a third Indonesian resolution on the West New Guinea dispute was put to the vote but failed to gain a two-thirds majority (41-29-11).\n\nFollowing the recent defeat at the UN, Indonesia embarked on a national campaign targeting Dutch interests in Indonesia; leading to the withdrawal of the Dutch flag carrier KLM's landing rights, mass demonstrations, and the seizure of the Dutch shipping line Koninklijke Paketvaart-Maatschappij (KPM), Dutch-owned banks, and other estates. By January 1958, 10,000 Dutch nationals had left Indonesia, many returning to the Netherlands. This spontaneous nationalisation had adverse repercussions on Indonesia's economy, disrupting communications and affecting the production of exports. President Sukarno also abandoned efforts to raise the dispute at the 1958 UNGA, claiming that reason and persuasion had failed. Following a sustained period of harassment against Dutch diplomatic representatives in Jakarta, Indonesia formally severed relations with the Netherlands in August 1960. \n\nIn response to Indonesian aggression, the Netherlands stepped up its efforts to prepare the Papuans for self-determination in 1959. These efforts culminated in the establishment of a hospital in Hollandia (modern–day Jayapura), a shipyard in Manokwari, agricultural research sites, plantations, and a military force known as the Papuan Volunteer Corps. By 1960, a legislative New Guinea Council had been established with a mixture of legislative, advisory and policy functions had been established. Half of its members were to be elected and elections for this council were held the following year. Most importantly, the Dutch also sought to create a sense of West Papuan national identity and these efforts led to the creation of a national flag (the Morning Star flag), a national anthem, and a coat of arms. The Dutch had planned to transfer independence to West New Guinea in 1970.\n\nBy 1960, other countries in the Asia-Pacific had taken notice of the dispute and began proposing initiatives to end it. During a visit to the Netherlands, the New Zealand Prime Minister Walter Nash suggested the idea of a united New Guinea state, consisting of both Dutch and Australian territories. This idea received little support from both Indonesia and other Western governments. Later that year, the Malayan Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman proposed a three-step initiative, which involved West New Guinea coming under United Nations trusteeship. The joint administrators would be three non-aligned nations Ceylon, India, and Malaya, which supported Indonesia's position. This solution involved the two belligerents, Indonesia and the Netherlands, re-establishing bilateral relations and the return of Dutch assets and investments to their owners. However, this initiative was scuttled in April 1961 due to opposition from Indonesia's Foreign Minister Subandrio, who publicly attacked Tunku's proposal.\n\nBy 1961, the Netherlands was struggling to find adequate international support for its policy to prepare West New Guinea for independent status under Dutch guidance. While the Netherlands' traditional Western allies—the United States, Great Britain, Australia, and New Zealand—were sympathetic to Dutch policy, they were unwilling to provide any military support in the event of conflict with Indonesia. On 26 September 1961, the Dutch Foreign Minister Joseph Luns offered to hand over the territory to a United Nations trusteeship. This proposal was firmly rejected by his Indonesian counterpart Subandrio, who likened the dispute to Katanga's attempted secession from the Republic of Congo during the Congo Crisis. By October 1961, Britain was open to transferring West New Guinea to Indonesia while the United States floated the idea of a jointly-administered trusteeship over the territory.\n\nOn 23 November 1961, the Indian delegation at the United Nations presented a draft resolution calling for the resumption of Dutch–Indonesian talks on terms which favoured Indonesia. Two days later, several Francophone countries in Africa tabled a rival resolution which favoured an independent West New Guinea. Indonesia favoured India's resolution while the Dutch, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand supported the Francophone African one. On 27 November 1961, both the Francophone African (52-41-9) and Indian (41-40-21) resolutions were put to the vote failed to gain a two–thirds majority at the UNGA. The failure of this final round of diplomacy in the UN convinced Indonesia to prepare for a military invasion.\n\nBy 1961, the United States had become concerned about the Indonesian military's purchase of Soviet weapons and equipment for a planned invasion of West New Guinea. The Kennedy administration feared an Indonesian drift towards Communism and wanted to court Sukarno away from the Soviet bloc and Communist China. The United States also wanted to repair relations with Jakarta, which had deteriorated due to the Eisenhower administration's covert support for regional uprisings in Sumatra and Sulawesi. These factors convinced the Kennedy administration to intervene diplomatically to bring about a peaceful solution to the dispute, which favored Indonesia.\n\nThroughout 1962, US diplomat Ellsworth Bunker facilitated top–secret high–level negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands. This produced a peace settlement known as the New York Agreement on 15 August 1962. As a face-saving measure, the Dutch would hand over West New Guinea to a provisional United Nations Temporary Executive Authority (UNTEA) on 1 October 1962, which then ceded the territory to Indonesia on 1 May 1963; formally ending the dispute. As part of the agreement, it was stipulated that a popular plebiscite would be held in 1969 to determine whether the Papuans would choose to remain in Indonesia or seek self-determination. Implementation of Indonesian governance was followed by sporadic fighting between Indonesian and pro-Papuan forces until 1969.\n\nFollowing the referendum in 1969, the territory was formally integrated into Indonesia. Instead of 816,000 Papuans, only 1,022 Papuan tribal representatives were allowed to vote and all of these were coerced into voting in favour of integration. While several international observers including journalists and diplomats criticised the referendum as being rigged, the United States and Australia support Indonesia's efforts to secure acceptance in the United Nations for the pro-integration vote. That same year, 84-member states voted in favour for the UN to accept the result, with 30 others abstaining. Due to Dutch efforts to promote a national identity, a significant number of Papuans refused to accept the territory's integration into Indonesia. These formed the separatist Free Papua Movement (OPM) and have waged an insurgency against Indonesia, which still continues to this day.\n\n\n\n\nThe following states have denounced the Act of Free Choice and support Papuan self-determination:\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Use of the term dates to at least 1925. Regime change may replace all or part of the state's most critical leadership system, administrative apparatus, or bureaucracy.\n\nIt can be the deliberate product of outside force, as in warfare. Rollback is the military strategy to impose a regime change by defeating an enemy and removing its regime by force. Regime change can occur through inside change caused by revolution, coup d'état or reconstruction following the failure of a state.\n\nThe transition from one political regime to another, especially through concerted political or military action, as was done in World War II to Italy, Germany, and Japan. (also known as the Axis Powers)\n\nThe term has been popularized by recent US presidents. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush regularly used the term in reference to Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. Ronald Reagan had previously called for regime change in Libya, directing the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to work towards that goal.\n\nThe term regime change is sometimes erroneously used to describe a change in the government of the day.\n\nThe term regime change can also be applied to bodies other than nation states.\n\nRegime change can be precipitated by revolution or a coup d'état. The Russian Revolution, the 1962 Burmese coup and the 1990 collapse of communism in Eastern Europe (→ #Dissolution of the Eastern Bloc) are consummate examples.\n\nExamples of internally driven regime change are the establishment of the French Fifth Republic (1958) and the Federation of Australia.\n\nIn addition to the above uses, the term 'regime change' can also be used in a more general sense, particularly in academic work, to refer to a change in political institutions or laws that affect the nature of the system as a whole. For example, the end of the Bretton Woods system was a regime change in the international system, as was the repeal of the National Mandatory Speed Limit in the United States. Regime changes are often viewed as ideal opportunities for natural experiments by social scientists.\n\nThe United States has been involved in and assisted in the overthrow of foreign governments (more recently termed \"regime change\") without the overt use of U.S. military force. Often, such operations are tasked to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\n\n"}

It was originally built by the St. George Gardeners' Club as a wine cellar. As wine demand decreased, the building was expanded to host theatrical productions. It operated in this capacity until sold to the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company in 1936. It was restored to an opera house in 1988 and is again open to the public.\n\nIn 1861, Brigham Young sent three hundred Mormon families to the south reaches of Utah Territory to establish a new settlement. Young envisioned a Mormon state that was completely self-sufficient, and one important goal in this regard was the production of cotton. The region settled was much warmer than the northern Salt Lake City, and it was thought that this would be good weather for cotton. Unfortunately for the settlers, this was not the case. The climate was too hot during the summer, producing only small harvests of cotton.\n\nThe original function of the St. George Opera House was a wine cellar. Grape production was an important secondary source of income for the settlers. The St. George Gardeners' Club formed in the mid-1860s to provide community support for farmers. In 1864, as one of their first projects, they built the cellar as a cool place to store surplus wine and to process grapes. It was mostly constructed below-ground along a hillside.\n\nAs wine demand diminished due to closing mines and pressure from the church, new plans were made for the cellar building. The Gardener's Club sold it to the Social Hall Company in the late 1870s. Extensions were added on the top and to the west of the main cellar to create a stage and seating for up to four hundred patrons. The performing arts were an important part of Mormon culture, and Young always ensured that artisans were among the families sent when organizing new settlements. Miles P. Romney was president of the Social Hall Company and the St. George Dramatic Association, occasionally performing in some of the plays. Shortly after it opened, Mormon missionaries shipped materials from a bankrupt opera house in New York City to the St. George Social Hall. The hall hosted its first opera 1886.\n\nThe hall was deeded to the local LDS church in 1900, as it was hopelessly in debt to it. However, the church continued to run productions in it. The Great Depression forced the church to sell the property to the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company in 1936. They used the building to process sugar beet seeds, an important source of income for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They sold the property to the St. George Neighborhood Redevelopment Agency in 1988, who restored the building to again function as an opera house.\n\n"}

Syndrome is a 2002 Serbian horror film written and directed by Dejan Zečević.\n\nIn 1958 a disheveled young woman named Margita stumbles into a Turkish bath, gives birth in one of the restrooms, and flushes the baby (the result of a rape) down a toilet. Twenty-two years later, a punk couple having sex in the same bathhouse are killed and dismembered by someone, who flushes the victims' remains down a toilet before meticulously cleaning the crime scene.\n\nNineteen years later, Teodora, her boyfriend Vaki, and their friends Tina and Sale visit the bathhouse (where what sounds like an infant's cries and laughter frequently emanate from the plumbing) to buy drugs from a pair of dealers named Cane and Sleš. Aside from those two, the only other people in the building are an attendant, a wino, and a gay magistar named Djordjevic. While Vaki and Sale are purchasing the narcotics from Cane, someone murders both Sleš and Tina, the latter in front of a hiding Teodora. After finding Tina's body and the traumatized Teodora, everyone attempts to flee the bathhouse, the exits to which have all been sealed. Convinced that the drunk is the murderer, Cane impulsively shoots him to death; the man is afterward revealed to have been innocent when Sale discovers that his dropped camcorder had briefly recorded the real killer, who is wearing boots similar to Djordjevic's.\n\nThe men lock Djordjevic in a washroom stall and explore the bathhouse with Teodora, uncovering the attendant's body (which later vanishes) and a tunnel to the sewers in her living quarters. Vaki and Djordjevic are both murdered by the killer, who is revealed to be the attendant, who is also Margita. Convinced that the baby (called \"Cloaca\") that she had flushed down a toilet decades ago is somehow still alive and living in the sewers, Margita has spent years murdering visitors to the bathhouse so that she can feed her offspring their body parts by flushing them down the building's toilets. Assisting Margita are a deranged former professor named Dragi HadžiTošić (who has filled the sewers with traps for catching both people and crocodiles) and Cane, who she had abducted as a toddler and raised as her son.\n\nAs the psychotic family prepares to butcher their captives, they begin succumbing to infighting; Margita slits HadžiTošić's throat because Cane had been accidentally injured by one of his traps, and because he appeared to be attracted to Teodora, who manages to break free of her restraints and stab Margita. Teodora then releases Sale and together the two enter the sewers, pursued by Cane, who Teodora shoves into a pit where he is seemingly eaten by an entity implied to be Cloaca. Upon reaching the surface, Teodora and Sale are confronted by the wounded Margita, but are saved by a passing vagrant, who dies killing Margita (who, with her dying breath, reveals that Teodora is pregnant). The film ends with a scene of Teodora giving birth to a child who is implied to have the same disorder (\"T.T. Syndrome\") as Cloaca.\n\n\nFrank Lafond of Kinoeye opined that \"T.T. Syndrome\" was \"a very effective, gruesome and rather gory\" film that was one of the \"best surprises\" of the 20th Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival. \"T.T. Syndrome\" was similarly praised by Ain't It Cool News, which called it \"a landmark film\" and \"an outstanding establishing of a potentially great author\" with a directorial-style that was comparable to both Dario Argento's and Lars von Trier's. The entertainingly \"screwed up\" film's style was also compared to Argento's classics by Film Threat, which wrote, \"Yes, \"T.T. Syndrome\" is loud and obnoxious, and the characters are beyond dumb, but this is what makes the genre work. This feels like a period correct Giallo film in almost every single significant way.\"\n\n"}

The language is also well known in linguistic and historical circles for the fact that two young co-conspirators published purported studies of the Taensa language in 1880-1882 that was later proven fraudulent, unequivocally in 1908-1910 by John R. Swanton.\n\nSome French missionary priests reported that they learned Natchez in order to speak to the Taensa; Mooney's summary of the people and missionary efforts describes the Taensa language as a variant of the Natchez.\n\nThe language has received academic attention in largest part for the fact that two young men, one a clerical student named Parisot, published purported \"material of the Taensa language, including papers, songs, a grammar and vocabulary\" in Paris in 1880-1882, reports which led to considerable interest on the part of philologists and linguists of the time. The work proved to be a \"fraudulent invention... of some one... from whom the manuscripts had originally come\" or perhaps of the student Parisot. The fraudulently invented language was unrelated to the actual language variant spoken by the Taensa people; the invention was unique enough in its grammar to arouse the interest referred to above. Several eminent scholars were taken in by the materials, but by 1885, Daniel Garrison Brinton and Julien Vinson had reported the work to be fraudulent. Later, Swanton exposed the work as a clear hoax, and the matter of the Parisot fraud continues to receive modern historical and linguistic attention to modern times.\n\nThe native Americans originally of northeastern Louisiana known as the Taensa were related to, but had separated themselves from the peoples of the Natchez nation, following a series of conflicts with them and others—e.g., the Taensa had been subject to slave raids by the Chickasaw, Yazoo, and Natchez. By the time of the Natchez Massacre under the governor of French Louisiana, Bienville, the Taensa had moved from Louisiana to Alabama. Also referred to as the Tensas, Tensaw, and \"grands Taensas\" (in French), and by many other near variants (see the article on the Taensa people), the people so named were village-dwelling native Americans originally from lands near present day Tensas Parish, Louisiana. Relocating several times in response to inter-tribal hostilities, the Taensa ultimately migrated, \"ca.\" 1740, under French protection to lands along the current Tensas river near Mobile, Alabama, only to return to the Red River in Louisiana after land cessions by the French to the English in 1763, then moving southward to Bayou Boeuf and Grand Lake before their disappearance as a community.\n\nWhile French missionary priests François de Montigny and Jean-François Buisson de Saint-Cosme stated that the Taensa spoke Natchez, a language that both missionaries were learning, others, such as Mooney describe the Taensa language as a variant of the Natchez.\n\nThe Taensa spoken by these people was a form of the Natchez, a language isolate that may be related to the Muskogean languages. Over time small differences in pronunciation emerged, but the two languages appear, based on the available data, and from this historical vantage point, to have been largely the same. Beginning in the early nineteenth century, the Taensa people became intermixed with other groups, particularly the Chitimacha. Their language survived into the second half of the nineteenth century, and people identifying as Taensa have been documented from the 1930s through to the present day.\n\nIn the 1880s two French students published a grammar and other material of what they claimed to be the hitherto undocumented language of the Taensa people of Louisiana. Jean Parisot, who submitted the documents for publication in Paris, was a nineteen-year-old student at a seminary in Plombières, France. The \"Grammaire et vocabulaire de la langue Taensa, avec textes traduits et commentés par J.-D. Haumonté, Parisot, L. Adam\" was published in 1882 in Paris and caused a stir among linguists.\n\nThe material included an outline of the grammar, vocabulary and fragments of text in the Taensa language. Parisot claimed that it was from Spanish sources written in Louisiana. When the material was published, two eminent French Americanists, Lucien Adam and Julien Vinson, supported the work.\n\nAlbert Samuel Gatschet defended the work at first. Gatschet stated that the language was unrelated to any other. In 1885 he started studies in Indiana, and thereafter became silent on the subject. The eminent ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton was also taken in at first. \nWriting of native American literature in 1883, Brinton quoted a complete song from the grammar, praising the songs as \"Ossianic in style.\" Later Brinton reversed his position and declared that the material was fake, publishing his reasons in 1885. Vinson also came to believe it was a hoax. Adam continued to defend the work for a while, but in 1885 he and Brinton co-authored \"Le Taensa a-t-il été forgé de toutes pièces\", which discussed whether the entire work was a forgery. John R. Swanton published definitive works in 1908 and 1910 that removed all doubt based on primarily historical rather than linguistic grounds. The text showed \"palpable and gross\" evidences of fraud. Swanton presented evidence that the Taensa people spoke either the Natchez language or a close variant of it.\n\nThe fraud could have been the work of the unknown individual that created the manuscripts and gave them to Parisot, or it could have been the work of Parisot, although Adam and Parisot jointly stated that the documents had not been Parisot's work when the scandal broke in 1885. Parisot later spent time in Turkey and in 1898 and 1902 published further works on linguistics based on his experience there.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2626534", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2626534", "title": "Tjurunga", "text": "Tjurunga\n\nA Tjurunga or as it is sometimes spelled, Churinga, is an object considered to be of religious significance by Central Australian indigenous people of the Arrernte (Aranda, Arunta) groups. Tjurunga often had a wide and indeterminate native significance. They may be used variously in sacred ceremonies, as bullroarers, in sacred ground paintings, in ceremonial poles, in ceremonial headgear, in sacred chants and in sacred earth mounds.\n\nGenerally speaking, tjurunga denote sacred stone or wooden objects possessed by private or group owners together with the legends, chants, and ceremonies associated with them. They were present among the Arrernte, the Luritja, the Kaitish, the Unmatjera, and the Illpirra. These items are most commonly oblong pieces of polished stone or wood. Some of these items have hair or string strung through them and were named \"bull roarers\" by Europeans. Upon each tjurunga is a totem of the group to which it belongs. Tjurunga are highly sacred, in fact, they are considered so sacred that only a few are able to see them and likewise it is considered sacrilegious to publish a picture of them. Durkheim suggests that the name \"churinga\" is normally a noun, but can also be used as an adjective meaning \"sacred\".\n\nThe term Tjurunga was translated by Strehlow to mean something similar to secret and personal. \"Tju\" means \"hidden\" or \"secret\", and \"runga\" means \"that which is personal to me\". Kempe argued against this translation and suggested that \"Tju\" means \"great\", \"powerful\", or \"sacred\" and that \"runga\" did not translate into personal ownership.\n\nThe ownership of sacred tjurunga amongst the Arrernte groups was determined largely by \"the conception site\" of every individual member of a patrilineal totemic clan. Because these relics are considered sacred, their availability is limited to a small number of people. During the early 20th century and before, only initiated males were able to see or touch these sacred objects. Women and uninitiated males were not allowed to touch them or see them, except from a far distance. The tjurunga were kept separately from the rest of the clan in a sacred location that was also unavailable to the uninitiated and women.\n\nWhile some theorists, such as Strehlow, have suggested these relics are amongst the very few forms of property which may be owned legitimately by individual persons in Central Australia, Durkheim and Kempe contend that the tjurunga cannot be owned by an individual. For example, Durkheim writes, \"As concerns the meaning of the word \"runga\", that seems very doubtful. The ceremonies of the Emu belong to all the members of the Emu clan; all can participate in them; they are not the personal property of any member.\"\n\nIn many myths the ancestors themselves are said to have used them and stored them away as their most treasured possessions. Such myths emphasise the life-holding magical properties of these tjurungas. The ancestor regarded his tjurunga as portions of his own being; and is always worried that strangers might come and rob him of the very essence of his life. Accordingly, legends abound with stories of theft and robbery, and the very fierce vengeance exacted. Tjuringa were thought to have magical properties. They would be rubbed on the body to confer sacredness onto the subject and to do things such as heal wounds. While tjuringa was useful to the individual, the clan's collective fate was also considered to be tied up with the items. After all, it was the totemic image that provided representation for the group on the tjuringa.\n\nThe acquisition of sufficient knowledge leading to possession of personal tjurunga was long, difficult and sometimes extremely painful. Practices differed amongst the various groups. Ted Strehlow describes how the men from the Northern, Southern and Western Arrernte groups were put on probation for several years after their last initiations.\n\nThe tjurunga were visible embodiments of some part of the fertility of the great ancestor of the totem in question. The body of the ancestor merely undergoes a transmutation into something that will weather all the assaults of time, change and decay. Stone tjurunga were thought to have been made by the ancestors themselves. The wooden tjurunga made by the old men are symbolical of the actual tjurunga which \"cannot be found\". These \"man-made\" tjurunga were accepted without reservation as sacred objects.\n\nAt the time of receiving his tjurunga-body a young man may be twenty-five years of age. He will often be thirty-five or forty years of age before the most sacred chants and ceremonies that are linked with it have passed into his possession. As he grows older and continues to demonstrate his worthiness, he receives an ever-increasing share in the tjurunga owned by his own totemic clan. Eventually he may become a member of the assembly of senior Lawmen who are honoured trustees for the ancient traditions of the whole clan.\n\nIn 1933, Strehlow noted that after the advent of white men to Central Australia, the young men employed by the foreign intruders were watched very closely by the old men of their group. In many cases, unless the young men were outstandingly generous in their gifts towards their elders, no ceremonies or chants of power and importance were handed on to this unworthy younger generation. With the death of the old men such chants and ceremonies passed into oblivion.\n\nThe old men would carefully note a young man's conduct. He had to be respectful towards his elders; he had to be attentive to their advice in all things. He would know the value of silence in ceremonial matters; no account of his past experiences could be spoken within the hearing of women and children. His own marriage had to conform to the laws of the group. One day the old men, sitting in a circle, would call him in to sit down in their midst. They began to chant. One man told Strehlow:\n\nThe old men seized my hand. They all struck up the chant-verse:\n\nAn old man produced a sharp kangaroo bone (ntjala). He stabbed my thumb with it, pushed the bone deeply underneath the nail. He drew the point out; the rest kept up the chant. He thrust it under the nail in a different place. He gradually loosened the thumbnail. It was slippery with blood. I almost shrieked with pain; the torment was unbearable. I have not forgotten it: the pain was not slight; it was exceedingly great. When the nail had been loosened, he took a sharp opossum tooth, forced it into the living flesh through the base of the thumb-nail, and tore the nail off from behind. Blood spurted over his hand. The man chanted:\n\nThen they seized my left hand and removed the thumb-nail in like manner.\n\nNowadays we make a great concession to the young men in our group. We no longer tear off their finger-nails. The price is too high; we give the tjurunga to them at a much lower cost. Besides, the young men of the present generation are no longer hardy enough to endure such pain.\n\nThese sacred relics were of high interest to early European anthropologists and sociologists, who were studying the nature of totemic religion and the sacred. Scholars such as Spencer, Gillen, Strehlow, Kempe and Durkheim all studied tjurunga. Durkheim discusses the nature of tjurunga throughout his seminal work \"The Elementary Forms of Religious Life\". He considered the tjurunga to be an archetype of the sacred item.\n\n\n\n\"Aboriginal readers from Central and Western Desert regions are respectfully advised that viewing or displaying images of sacred objects may be considered inappropriate by their communities.\"\n"}

He is the son of King T.J.T. Princewill and is a Prince of the Kalabari Kingdom of Rivers State, Nigeria.\n\nPrincewill was the Chief Technology Officer of Panasonic in the United Kingdom (UK) and served at the Global Asset Management desk of Citibank. His business interests are in both upstream and downstream oil and gas, information technology, environmental waste management, aviation services and film production.\n\nPrince Tonye Princewill was born in the UK to the family of King (Prof) T.J.T. Princewill, the Amanyanabo of Kalabari Kingdom of the Amachree Dynasty of Rivers State. His father was a Professor of Medical Microbiology before he became a monarch.\n\nTonye Princewill started his early education in the United Kingdom, before returning with his parents to Nigeria. In Nigeria, he was enrolled at Hillcrest High School in Jos from 1976–1980. He then attended Federal Government College (Port Harcourt) where he obtained his West African Senior Certificate/ General Certificate of Education O'Level in 1985. He took his BSc in Petroleum engineering at the University of Port Harcourt. He did a master's degree in Mineral Resources Engineering at the Imperial College London.\n\nTonye Princewill started off his career with Royal Dutch Shell as a Reservoir and Well-site Petroleum Engineer. He also worked briefly with the UK's Oil and Gas Regulatory Agency, the Department of Trade and Industry. He later moved into private business and established the Riverdrill Group of Companies (Nigeria) where he is chairman.\n\nPrince Tonye Princewill is a film producer. He premiered the film Kajola, a film which explored the implications of the continuous neglect of the poor as well as the widening gulf between the rich and poor and the ensuing catastrophic outcomes stemming from such neglect. Tonye Princewill also sponsored the premiere of the film Nnenda which was geared towards creating awareness for the less-privileged in society. He has also premiered other movies such as The Figurine and Valour, a movie that deals with the Niger Delta and Boko Haram issues\n\nCurrently, he is one of the executive producers of the first movie in Nigeria on celluloid camera titled '76 (film) hinged and anchored on the coup of 1976 in Nigeria aimed at preserving a remarkable part of Nigeria's history for the incoming generation.\n\nPrincewill's political career started when he was nominated as the gubernatorial candidate of the Action Congress for the governorship of Rivers State in 2007. He was supported by the then former Vice-President of Nigeria and the AC Presidential candidate in 2007 elections, Atiku Abubakar and former Governor of Lagos and National Leader of ACN, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Tonye Princewill's campaign attracted significant grassroots support. He lost the election under contested circumstances to the People's Democratic Party's candidate, Celestine Omehia.\n\nTonye Princewill launched a legal challenge against the newly elected governor shortly after the election results were released. He offered evidence to prove to the electoral tribunal that the election was rigged. In a newspaper interview, he alleged that Celestine Omehia offered him a Naira 1.5 billion (approximately USD 10 million) bribe to withdraw the case before the tribunal, which he rejected.\n\nFollowing a Supreme Court decision to replace Celestine Omehia with another People's Democratic Party candidate Rotimi Amaechi, he withdrew his case at the tribunal following a local party decision of the Action Congress in Rivers State, a move which drew criticism from his supporters. \nTonye Princewill said in a report that \"we took the decision at the time that the enemy of your enemy is your friend,\" noting that he was in battle with Celestine Omehia and his 'godfather', Dr. Peter Odili, the former governor of Rivers State, when Rotimi Amaechi was installed by the court.\"\n\nTonye Princewill later led members of the opposition parties in Rivers State under the banner of the Forum of Organized Opposition Political Parties to form a unity government with Amechi's administration. \nTonye Princewill's support of the Amaechi's government received mixed reviews. Some viewed it with scepticism, while others saw it as necessary for the development and stability of Rivers State. His announcement in 2010 that he was returning to the People's Democratic Party was controversial and weakened opposition in the state.\n\nIn 2013, he joined the management committee of People's Democratic Movement (PDM), the founding movement behind the People's Democratic Party, where his serves as the Director of Organisation.\n\nIn first months of 2014, after several months of speculation on his political future, Tonye Princewill indicated his interest to succeed Rotimi Amaechi, the current governor of Rivers State.\nThen in April 2014, he announced the formation of an Exploratory Committee to explore the viability of his candidacy of running for governor of Rivers State. Tonye Princewill was a governorship aspirant candidate for the People's Democratic Party, but in November 2014 announced that he had been disqualified on the instruction of Nyesom Wike, former minister of State for Education and fellow Governorship aspirant on the grounds of \"not being a PDP member\".\n\nIn January 2015, he became the Rivers State governorship candidate of the Labour Party on a single-issue manifesto; job-creation.\n\nTonye Princewill writes about confronting corruption, infrastructure development, behaviour change, security, health, academic advancement and ethnic harmony in his weekly column in the Vanguard newspaper \nAs a leading advocate of youth empowerment in Nigeria, he has expressed concern about the use of youth in Nigeria, particularly during elections, for violence and thuggery.\n\nFollowing the heavy floods that ravaged parts of Nigeria in 2012, he organised relief activities for Niger Delta communities through the Princewill Trust.\n\nHe has launched several initiatives to support Nigerian youth, rural women, orphans and widows. \nIn June 2012, Tonye Princewill sponsored Nigerian youth delegations on tours to Dubai and Ghana to learn about entrepreneurship, governance, leadership and self-development.\nIn January 2013, in celebration of his 44th birthday, Tonye Princewill released a documentary titled \"Man. Mentor. Maverick\" in which he speaks about his vision of equal opportunities for all.\n\nTonye Princewill is an advocate for open government and effective public service delivery using modern technology. This earned him the nickname, the \"Digital Politician.\"\n\nTonye Princewill sponsored several baseline studies in 2013, covering the state of education, environment, and health in Rivers State. In education, research showed that a large number of Model Secondary and Primary Schools were not finished and had been abandoned. \nThe management of oil spillages in Rivers State, a catalyst for youth restiveness, was seen as ineffective across local governments in the State. Survey respondents reported that funds which ought to have gone into cleaning and sanitisation of their communities were diverted by local officials. These findings also support press reports about corruption in government allocations to oil producing areas. \nIn the area of health, there is widespread disenchantment about the lack of improvement within the sector. Weak health service delivery in Rivers State is forcing many patients to seek medical attention at unregulated traditional medicine shops. Challenges associated to HIV/AIDS, the lack of qualified health professionals, and unfinished health projects, are serious concerns among respondents. These findings substantiate reports in the press that raise questions about the efficacy of funds injected into the sector by the Rivers State administration.\n\nTonye Princewill is married to Rosemary, and has a daughter and twin boys.\n\n"}

The company was founded by Paddy Cosgrave, David Kelly and Daire Hickey. The topic of the conference is centered on internet technology and attendees range from Fortune 500 companies to smaller tech companies. This contains a mix of CEOs and founders of tech start ups together with a range of people from across the global technology industry.\n\nWeb Summit runs events throughout the world including F.ounders, RISE Conference in Hong Kong, Collision in New Orleans, SURGE in Bangalore and MoneyConf in Dublin.\n\nFor the first five years the event was held in Dublin, Ireland. In September 2015 Paddy Cosgrave, Web Summit co-founder, announced that Web Summit would be held in Lisbon starting in 2016. In October 2018, the Portuguese government announced a ten-year contract extension with the Web Summit.\n\nAccording to Forbes, the Web Summit is the best technology conference on the planet.\n\n\nWeb Summit 2017 took place in the Altice Arena in Lisbon from November 6 - 9. The event promised to bring 60,000 attendees from over 160 countries together.\n\n1,000 speakers were initially confirmed for the conference and, finally, over 1200 spoke. From the political sphere, speakers such as Former Vice President of the United States of America Al Gore, European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager, and former president of France François Hollande were announced early. In addition to these speakers, big names in tech attending were Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, Microsoft president Brad Smith, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, Arm Holdings CEO Simon Segars, Slack co-founder and CEO Stewart Butterfield, Asana co-founder and CEO and Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, , Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica and Booking.com president and CEO Gillian Tans.\n\nSpeakers include former world heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko, actress and activist Sophia Bush, former Portuguese professional football player and Ballon D'Or winner Luis Figo, Vogue international editor Suzy Menkes, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, musician Wyclef Jean, and Game of Thrones actor Liam Cunningham.\n\nIn September 2015 Web Summit co-founder and CEO Paddy Cosgrave announced that the event would be held in Lisbon for three consecutive editions, from 2016 to 2018. Cosgrave cited the local startup scene and a \"cosmopolitan city with better infrastructure conditions and a larger number of hotel rooms\" for the decision.\n\nThe three-day event held from November 7—10 at the Altice Arena, site of Expo '98, drew 53,056 attendees from more than 150 countries and more than 1,500 start-ups spread over 21 venues. \n\nAmong the more than 600 speakers were a number of tech top executives from around the world, including John Chambers of Cisco, Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, and Amazon CTO Werner Vogels. Also speaking at the event were prominent figures from non-tech areas, such as actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Salil Shetty of Amnesty International and Mogens Lykketoft, president of the general assembly at the United Nations, as well as footballer Luís Figo and both the Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa and Prime Minister António Costa. The percentage of women among speakers at the Web Summit was 47% according to independent estimates.\n\nWeb Summit 2015 was held over three days from 3 November until the 5 November at the RDS in Dublin. Over 42,000 people attended the event over the three days. Speakers included Ed Catmull of Pixar, Michael Dell, Bill Ford and Chris Froome.\n\nIn September 2015 Web Summit announced that they would be moving the event from Dublin to Lisbon. Following the announcement organisers released email correspondence between the Irish Government and Web Summit CEO Paddy Cosgrave about hotel costs, traffic and other issues around infrastructure in Dublin. This led to a debate in the Irish media about the support the Government had provided to the event since it began and what future promises they could make.\n\nProblems arose with the Wi-Fi, but on a lesser scale than in 2014.\n\nWeb Summit 2014 was held over three days and consisted of nine stages or Summits as they are known; Centre, Machine, Enterprise, Marketing, Builders, Society, Sport, Film and Music. Eva Longoria, Peter Thiel and Bono were among the speakers that spoke over the three-day event, with attendance of 22,000 people from 109 countries.\n\nOn Day 1 there were problems with the WiFi network and Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave took to the stage on two occasions to apologise for the connectivity problems. The RDS defended their technical set-up with CEO Michael Duffy saying, \"The WiFi has successfully responded to the exceptional demands placed on it. This is an unprecedented WiFi density compared to similar European tech events.\" Attendees were mostly disparaging in their remarks, with some deriding it on social media as \"the most Irish thing ever\".\n\nInternational broadcasters including CNBC, CNN, Fox Business News, Bloomberg, Sky News. Al Jazeera and the BBC all covered the event.\n\nAfter the announcement of the decision to move the 2016 Web Summit to Lisbon, several Irish technology correspondents cited the WiFi debacle as one major push factor behind the move.\n\nIn 2013, over 10,000 people attended the Web Summit, the vast majority from outside Ireland. Speakers included Elon Musk, Shane Smith, Tony Hawk, Drew Houston, and Niklas Zennström.\n\nThe event expanded in its scope with a number of side-events launching as part it, including the Night Summit, a series of after-hours events featuring musicians from throughout the world, and the Food Summit, a two-day showcase of gourmet Irish Food.\n\nIrish Prime Minister, Enda Kenny, also opened the NASDAQ Market from the Web Summit, the first time it was opened outside of New York since the Facebook IPO. The event was covered substantially in the international media with Bloomberg Television, CNN, the Wall Street Journal and Wired covering the event.\n\nIn 2012, 4,200 people attended Web Summit, approximately 40% of these came from companies based in Ireland (which provides a European HQ for several major tech companies) and 60% came from companies based elsewhere in Europe. Speakers included Tim Armstrong, Wael Ghonim, and Arkady Volozh.\n\nA number of companies from across the world also launched their new products or made announcements as part of the event.\n\nThe first Web Summit was a mix of bloggers, journalists and technologists in a hotel on the outskirts of Dublin. Panelists and speakers included Iain Dale, the political blogger, Ben Hammersley of the Guardian and Ian Douglas of the Daily Telegraph. In 2010 it was a meet-up for 400 or so of the local technology community in the Chartered Accountants House in Dublin. Speakers were mainly local entrepreneurs, business people, and investors. In 2011, the event tripled in size and moved to the Royal Dublin Society. Speakers included Chad Hurley, Jack Dorsey and Matt Mullenweg.\n\n\n"}

The program has been shared with other spy agencies including the Australian Signals Directorate, Canada's Communications Security Establishment, New Zealand's Government Communications Security Bureau, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, Japan's Defense Intelligence Headquarters and the German Bundesnachrichtendienst.\n\nThe program's purpose was publicly revealed in July 2013, by Edward Snowden in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" and \"O Globo\" newspapers. The code name was already public knowledge because it is mentioned in earlier articles, and like many other code names can also be seen in job postings, and in the online resumes of employees.\n\nOn July 3, 2014, excerpts of XKeyscore's source code were first published by German public broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk, a member of ARD. A team of experts analyzed the source code.\n\nXKeyscore is a complicated system, and various authors have different interpretations of its actual capabilities. Edward Snowden and Glenn Greenwald explained XKeyscore as being a system which enables almost unlimited surveillance of anyone anywhere in the world, while the NSA has said that usage of the system is limited and restricted.\n\nAccording to \"The Washington Post\" and national security reporter Marc Ambinder, XKeyscore is an NSA data-retrieval system which consists of a series of user interfaces, backend databases, servers and software that selects certain types of data and metadata that the NSA has already collected using other methods.\n\nOn January 26, 2014, the German broadcaster Norddeutscher Rundfunk asked Edward Snowden in its TV interview: \"What could you do if you would use XKeyscore?\" and he answered:\n\nAccording to \"The Guardian\"s Glenn Greenwald, low-level NSA analysts can, via systems like XKeyscore, \"listen to whatever emails they want, whatever telephone calls, browsing histories, Microsoft Word documents. And it's all done with no need to go to a court, with no need to even get supervisor approval on the part of the analyst.\"\n\nHe added that the NSA's databank of collected communications allows its analysts to listen \"to the calls or read the emails of everything that the NSA has stored, or look at the browsing histories or Google search terms that you've entered, and it also alerts them to any further activity that people connected to that email address or that IP address do in the future\".\n\nIn an official statement from July 30, 2013, the NSA said \"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.

[...] to collect the information, that enables us to perform our missions successfully – to defend the nation and to protect U.S. and allied troops abroad.\"\nIn terms of access, an NSA press statement reads that there is no \"unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks.\" and that there are \"[...]stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. One feature is the system's ability to limit what an analyst can do with a tool, based on the source of the collection and each analyst's defined responsibilities.\"\n\nAccording to an NSA slide presentation about XKeyscore from 2013, it is a \"DNI Exploitation System/Analytic Framework\". DNI stands for Digital Network Intelligence, which means intelligence derived from internet traffic.\n\nEdward Snowden said about XKeyscore: \"It’s a front end search engine\" in an interview with the German Norddeutscher Rundfunk.\n\nXKeyscore is considered a \"passive\" program, in that it listens, but does not transmit anything on the networks that it targets. But it can trigger other systems, which perform \"active\" attacks through Tailored Access Operations which are \"tipping\", for example, the QUANTUM family of programs, including QUANTUMINSERT, QUANTUMHAND, QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMBOT and QUANTUMCOPPER and Turbulence. These run at so-called \"defensive sites\" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the US. Trafficthief, a core program of Turbulence, can alert NSA analysts when their targets communicate, and trigger other software programs, so select data is \"promoted\" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's \"corporate repositories\" for long term storage.\n\nXKeyscore consists of over 700 servers at approximately 150 sites where the NSA collects data, like \"US and allied military and other facilities as well as US embassies and consulates\" in many countries around the world. Among the facilities involved in the program are four bases in Australia and one in New Zealand.\n\nAccording to an NSA presentation from 2008, these XKeyscore servers are fed with data from the following collection systems:\n\nIn a single, undated slide published by Swedish media in December 2013, the following additional data sources for XKeyscore are mentioned:\n\nFrom these sources, XKeyscore stores \"full-take data\", which are indexed by plug-ins that extract certain types of metadata (like phone numbers, e-mail addresses, log-ins, and user activity) and index them in metadata tables, which can be queried by analysts. XKeyscore has been integrated with MARINA, which is NSA's database for internet metadata.\n\nHowever, the system continuously gets so much Internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content data remain on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for up to thirty days. A detailed commentary on an NSA presentation published in \"The Guardian\" in July 2013 cites a document published in 2008 declaring that \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\n\nAccording to a document from an internal GCHQ website which was disclosed by the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" in June 2014, there are three different types of the Xkeyscore system:\n\n\nFor analysts, XKeyscore provides a \"series of viewers for common data types\", which allows them to query terabytes of raw data gathered at the aforementioned collection sites. This enables them to find targets that cannot be found by searching only the metadata, and also to do this against data sets that otherwise would have been dropped by the front-end data processing systems. According to a slide from an XKeyscore presentation, NSA collection sites select and forward less than 5% of the internet traffic to the PINWALE database for internet content.\n\nBecause XKeyscore holds raw and unselected communications traffic, analysts can not only perform queries using \"strong selectors\" like e-mail addresses, but also using \"soft selectors\", like keywords, against the body texts of e-mail and chat messages and digital documents and spreadsheets in English, Arabic and Chinese.\n\nThis is useful because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous\" and therefore those activities can't be found by just looking for e-mail addresses of a target. When content has been found, the analyst might be able to find new intelligence or a strong selector, which can then be used for starting a traditional search.\n\nBesides using soft selectors, analysts can also use the following other XKeyscore capabilities:\n\n\"The Guardian\" opined in 2013 that most of these things cannot be detected by other NSA tools, because they operate with strong selectors (like e-mail and IP addresses and phone numbers) and the raw data volumes are too high to be forwarded to other NSA databases.\n\nIn 2008, NSA planned to add a number of new capabilities in the future, like VoIP, , Exif tags, which often include geolocation (GPS) data.\n\nThe NSA slides published in \"The Guardian\" during 2013 claimed that XKeyscore had played a role in capturing 300 terrorists by 2008, which could not be substantiated as the redacted documents do not cite instances of terrorist interventions.\n\nA 2011 report from the NSA unit in the Dagger Complex (close to Griesheim in Germany) said that XKeyscore made it easier and more efficient to target surveillance. Previously, analysis often accessed data NSA was not interested in. XKeyscore allowed them to focus on the intended topics, while ignoring unrelated data. XKeyscore also proved to be outstanding for tracking active groups associated with the Anonymous movement in Germany, because it allows for searching on patterns, rather than particular individuals. An analyst is able to determine when targets research new topics, or develop new behaviors.\n\nTo create additional motivation, the NSA incorporated various gamification features. For instance, analysts who were especially good at using XKeyscore could acquire \"skilz\" points and \"unlock achievements.\" The training units in Griesheim were apparently successful and analysts there had achieved the \"highest average of skilz points\" compared with all other NSA departments participating in the training program.\n\nAccording to documents \"Der Spiegel\" acquired from Snowden, the German intelligence agencies BND (foreign intelligence) and BfV (domestic intelligence) were also allowed to use the XKeyscore system. In those documents the BND agency was described as the NSA's most prolific partner in information gathering. This led to political confrontations, after which the directors of the German intelligence agencies briefed members of the German parliamentary intelligence oversight committee on July 25, 2013. They declared that XKeyscore has been used by the BND since 2007 and that the BfV has been using a test version since 2012. The directors also explained that the program is not for collecting data, but rather only for the analysis of collected data.\n\nAs part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand (called the Five Eyes) for the purpose of intelligence collaboration and data sharing. According to documents leaked by Snowden, the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore.\n\nThe classified documents leaked by Snowden also indicate that in April 2013, NSA had secretly provided the XKeyscore system to the Japanese government.\n\n\n"}

The exhibition is organised by the National Eisteddfod and supported by the Arts Council of Wales.\n\nTo exhibit in the exhibition, artists and designers must be either born in Wales, have Welsh parents, or have lived or worked in Wales for at least three years prior to the submission deadline, or have the ability to speak, read or write Welsh. In 2010 exhibitors were chosen from 2,500 entries. Forty finalists were chosen to exhibit. The final selection is chosen by a panel of experts. \n\nY Lle Celf is usually housed in a temporary building on the Eisteddfod grounds, though at Ebbw Vale in 2010 it was held in the disused basement of a steel rolling mill and, in Cardiff Bay in 2018, was held inside the Welsh Government Senedd building.\n\nIn 2012 the Eisteddfod were forced to issue an apology and withdraw four portrait paintings, by artist David Rees Davies, which showed imagery related to a nearby murder of a schoolgirl. One of the paintings appeared to portray the bleeding victim, another showed her killer.\n\nIn 2013 the Gold Medal for Fine Art was won by video artist Josephine Sowden, despite her work using English language based gibberish and seemingly flouting a language rule dating back to 1950. The 2013 Ivor Davies Award winner, Iwan Bala, had included English and Spanish text in his paintings, in addition to Welsh. For 2014 entries, application forms drew attention to the language rule, which says any original words in art works must be in Welsh.\n\nEach year the following are awarded to an exhibitor at Y Lle Celf:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31081608", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31081608", "title": "Yéle Haiti", "text": "Yéle Haiti\n\nYéle Haiti was a charitable organization established in 2001 by Haitian musician and rapper Wyclef Jean, who was born in Haiti and has kept ties there. It is legally known as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and incorporated in the state of Illinois, United States. It operated into 2012, when it was closed after investigations by the New York State Attorney General over financial issues. The title was coined by Jean, meaning \"cry for freedom.\" It publicized its fundraising to aid victims of the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, but by February of that year, the \"New York Times\" reported that questions were raised over its finances, and that funds had been used to benefit Jean personally and members of his circle. The charity is subject to suits in Haiti attempting to recover unpaid debts.\n\nYéle Haiti was founded as a charitable organization by Haitian musician and rapper Wyclef Jean. Born in Haiti and immigrating with his family to the United States at age nine, he grew up in northern New Jersey. Becoming a Grammy Award-winning musician and rapper, he has kept family and other ties in Haiti.\n\nThe charity was known legally as the Wyclef Jean Foundation and was incorporated in 2001 in the state of Illinois. After the island suffered damage in 2004's Hurricane Jeanne, the foundation provided scholarships to 3,600 children in Gonaïves, Haiti, with funding from Comcel telephone service company. Yéle continued to provide scholarships, school funding, meals, and other charitable benefits to citizens of Haiti in the following years.\n\nThe 2010 Haiti earthquake devastated the island and its capital Port-au-Prince. According to Jean, Yéle raised more than $1 million in 24 hours using a plea on Twitter. His foundation raised additional funds after Jean took part in an MTV donation drive and other publicity efforts to benefit survivors of the earthquake. Together with actor and producer George Clooney, Jean organized the \"Hope for Haiti Now\" telethon. The most watched telethon to date in history, it aired on almost every network and many cable channels. Jean appeared as the last performer on the telethon, singing a medley that ended with Haiti's traditional Rara music.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, the Yéle organization donated funds to orphanages, street cleaning crews, hospitals, and medical clinics. It also organized food service to provide hot meals to refugees and victims.\n\nNot long after Yéle's heavily publicized efforts to raise money for disaster relief, questions were raised beginning in February 2010 about the history and management of the charity. Referring to materials posted during an investigation by the Smoking Gun website, the \"New York Times\" reported that the Wyclef Jean Foundation had failed to file required tax returns for 2005, 2006 and 2007 until 2009. It said that by early 2010, returns and records for 2008 had still not been filed with the Internal Revenue Service. The article, which included allegations by the Smoking Gun of mismanagement of funds, also reported criticism of the foundation by its former executive director, Sanjay Rawal. He questioned the foundation's ability to handle large projects and criticized its lack of financial controls.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2012, Yéle Haiti was managed by Rawal, co-founder and former chief executive Hugh Locke, Wyclef Jean (until he resigned after he announced his candidacy in August 2010 for the presidency of Haiti), and former chief executive Derek Q. Johnson. In August 2012, Johnson resigned and announced the closure of the charity. He said in a statement, \"As the foundation’s sole remaining employee, my decision implies the closure of the organization as a whole.\" Johnson's resignation followed an investigation of the charity by the New York state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman. His office had been conducting settlement talks with Yéle officers over allegations of mismanagement - including improper payments by the charity to Jean, members of his family, and others connected to Jean. A forensic audit conducted by Schneiderman's office disclosed that in 2010, the year of the earthquake in Haiti, the organization had spent more than $9 million, with half of it for travel by Jean and other representatives, as well as salaries and consultants’ fees, and expenses related to the charity's offices and warehouse. The charity, which remains closed, is the subject of lawsuits in Haiti for unpaid debts.\n"}
