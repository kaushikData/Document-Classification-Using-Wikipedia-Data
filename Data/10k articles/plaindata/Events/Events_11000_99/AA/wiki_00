It was discovered on 17 October 1906, by astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg Observatory in Germany. The asteroid was named after Patroclus from Greek mythology. It was the second trojan to be discovered and the only member of the Trojan camp named after a Greek character. The dark D-type asteroid is also slow rotator and one of the largest Jupiter trojans. \"Patroclus\" is one of five Jovian asteroids targeted by the \"Lucy\" space probe to be visited in 2033. In 2001, a moon – later named Menoetius, and slightly smaller than its primary – was discovered. It was the first discovery of binary asteroid among the Jupiter trojans.\n\n\"Patroclus\" orbits in Jupiter's trailing Lagrangian point, , in an area called the Trojan camp after one of the sides in the legendary Trojan War (the other node, at the , is called the \"Greek camp\").\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.5–5.9 AU once every 11 years and 11 months (4,353 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 22° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid's observation arc begins at the discovering Heidelberg Observatory in November 1906, about 3 weeks after its official discovery observation.\n\nIn 2001, it was discovered that \"Patroclus\" is a binary system, made up of two components with a minor-planet moon of roughly similar size. It is one of 18 binary Trojan asteroids known to exist. In 2006, accurate measurements of the orbit from the Keck Laser guide star adaptive optics system were reported.\n\nIt was estimated that the two components orbit around their center of mass in days at a distance of in a roughly circular orbit. Combining these observations with thermal measurements taken in 2000, the sizes of the components of the system were estimated at 106 km and 98 km, with an equivalent whole-system diameter of 145 km, refined by later measurements from the Keck Observatory to approximately 122 km and 112 km for each partner, and a co-orbital period of hours ( days).\n\nMore recent direct optical measurements using stellar occlusion data pin the orbital distance closer to 664.6 km, and give a size for the slightly larger component, which retains the name Patroclus, as 124.6x98.2 km and overall volume equivalent to a 113 km sphere, with the smaller component, now named Menoetius ( ; official designation (617) Patroclus I Menoetius) after the legendary father of Patroclus, measuring 117.2x93.0 km with a volume equivalent to a 104 km diameter sphere. It was previously known by the provisional designation .\n\nSince 1989, several rotational lightcurves of \"Patroclus\" have been obtained from photometric observations. Analysis of the best rated lightcurves gave a rotation period between 102.8 and 103.5 hours with a brightness amplitude of less than 0.1 magnitude (). A low brightness variation typically indicates that a body has a nearly spheroidal shape. Its long rotation period makes it a slow rotator.\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the \"Patroclus\" system has an effective combined size between 140.36 and 140.92 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.047. The \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0471 and a diameter of 140.92 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.19.\n\nRecent evidence suggests that the objects are icy like comets, rather than rocky like most asteroids. In the Tholen classification, \"Patroclus\" is a dark P-type asteroid.\n\nBecause the density of the components (0.88 g/cm³) is less than water and about one third that of rock, it was suggested that the Patroclus system, previously thought to be a pair of rocky asteroids, is more similar to a comet in composition. It is suspected that many Jupiter trojans are in fact small planetesimals captured in the Lagrange point of the Jupiter–Sun system during the migration of the giant planets 3.9 billion years ago. This scenario was proposed by A. Morbidelli and colleagues in a series of articles published in May 2005 in \"Nature\".\n\nPatroclus is a proposed target for \"Lucy\", a mission to several asteroids, mostly Jupiter trojans. The mission's targets with their flyby dates are:\n\nThis minor planet was named after the Greek hero Patroclus from Greek mythology. Friend of Achilles, he was killed by Hector during the Trojan War \"(see also and )\". The minor planet's name was proposed by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa. The official naming citation was mentioned in \"The Names of the Minor Planets\" by Paul Herget in 1955 ().\n\n\"Patroclus\" is the only object in the Trojan camp to be named after a Greek rather than a Trojan character. The naming conventions for the Jupiter trojans were not adopted until after Patroclus was named (similarly, the asteroid Hektor is the only Trojan character to appear in the Greek camp).\n\n"}

{"id": "847879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=847879", "title": "Age of the universe", "text": "Age of the universe\n\nIn physical cosmology, the age of the universe is the time elapsed since the Big Bang. The current measurement of the age of the universe is billion (10) years within the Lambda-CDM concordance model. The uncertainty has been narrowed down to 21 million years, based on a number of projects that all give extremely close figures for the age. These include studies of the microwave background radiation, and measurements by the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe and other probes. Measurements of the cosmic background radiation give the cooling time of the universe since the Big Bang, and measurements of the expansion rate of the universe can be used to calculate its approximate age by extrapolating backwards in time.\n\nThe Lambda-CDM concordance model describes the evolution of the universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state over a span of about 13.8 billion years of cosmological time. This model is well understood theoretically and strongly supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP. In contrast, theories of the origin of the primordial state remain very speculative. If one extrapolates the Lambda-CDM model backward from the earliest well-understood state, it quickly (within a small fraction of a second) reaches a singularity. This is known as the \"initial singularity\" or the \"Big Bang singularity\". This singularity is not understood as having a physical significance in the usual sense, but it is convenient to quote times measured \"since the Big Bang\" even though they do not correspond to a physically measurable time. For example, \"10 seconds after the Big Bang\" is a well-defined era in the universe's evolution. If one referred to the same era as \"13.8 billion years minus 10 seconds ago\", the precision of the meaning would be lost because the minuscule latter time interval is eclipsed by uncertainty in the former.\n\nThough the universe might in theory have a longer history, the International Astronomical Union presently use \"age of the universe\" to mean the duration of the Lambda-CDM expansion, or equivalently the elapsed time since the Big Bang in the current observable universe.\n\nSince the universe must be at least as old as the oldest things in it, there are a number of observations which put a lower limit on the age of the universe; these include the temperature of the coolest white dwarfs, which gradually cool as they age, and the dimmest turnoff point of main sequence stars in clusters (lower-mass stars spend a greater amount of time on the main sequence, so the lowest-mass stars that have evolved off of the main sequence set a minimum age).\n\nThe problem of determining the age of the universe is closely tied to the problem of determining the values of the cosmological parameters. Today this is largely carried out in the context of the ΛCDM model, where the universe is assumed to contain normal (baryonic) matter, cold dark matter, radiation (including both photons and neutrinos), and a cosmological constant. The fractional contribution of each to the current energy density of the universe is given by the density parameters Ω, Ω, and Ω. The full ΛCDM model is described by a number of other parameters, but for the purpose of computing its age these three, along with the Hubble parameter formula_1, are the most important.\n\nIf one has accurate measurements of these parameters, then the age of the universe can be determined by using the Friedmann equation. This equation relates the rate of change in the scale factor \"a\"(\"t\") to the matter content of the universe. Turning this relation around, we can calculate the change in time per change in scale factor and thus calculate the total age of the universe by integrating this formula. The age \"t\" is then given by an expression of the form\nwhere formula_1 is the Hubble parameter and the function \"F\" depends only on the fractional contribution to the universe's energy content that comes from various components. The first observation that one can make from this formula is that it is the Hubble parameter that controls that age of the universe, with a correction arising from the matter and energy content. So a rough estimate of the age of the universe comes from the Hubble time, the inverse of the Hubble parameter. With a value for formula_1 around , the Hubble time evaluates to formula_5 = billion years.\n\nTo get a more accurate number, the correction factor \"F\" must be computed. In general this must be done numerically, and the results for a range of cosmological parameter values are shown in the figure. For the Planck values (Ω, Ω) = (0.3086, 0.6914), shown by the box in the upper left corner of the figure, this correction factor is about \"F\" = 0.956. For a flat universe without any cosmological constant, shown by the star in the lower right corner, \"F\" = is much smaller and thus the universe is younger for a fixed value of the Hubble parameter. To make this figure, Ω is held constant (roughly equivalent to holding the CMB temperature constant) and the curvature density parameter is fixed by the value of the other three.\n\nApart from the Planck satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) was instrumental in establishing an accurate age of the universe, though other measurements must be folded in to gain an accurate number. CMB measurements are very good at constraining the matter content Ω and curvature parameter Ω. It is not as sensitive to Ω directly, partly because the cosmological constant becomes important only at low redshift. The most accurate determinations of the Hubble parameter \"H\" come from Type Ia supernovae. Combining these measurements leads to the generally accepted value for the age of the universe quoted above.\n\nThe cosmological constant makes the universe \"older\" for fixed values of the other parameters. This is significant, since before the cosmological constant became generally accepted, the Big Bang model had difficulty explaining why globular clusters in the Milky Way appeared to be far older than the age of the universe as calculated from the Hubble parameter and a matter-only universe. Introducing the cosmological constant allows the universe to be older than these clusters, as well as explaining other features that the matter-only cosmological model could not.\n\nNASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) project's nine-year data release in 2012 estimated the age of the universe to be years (13.772 billion years, with an uncertainty of plus or minus 59 million years).\n\nHowever, this age is based on the assumption that the project's underlying model is correct; other methods of estimating the age of the universe could give different ages. Assuming an extra background of relativistic particles, for example, can enlarge the error bars of the WMAP constraint by one order of magnitude.\n\nThis measurement is made by using the location of the first acoustic peak in the microwave background power spectrum to determine the size of the decoupling surface (size of the universe at the time of recombination). The light travel time to this surface (depending on the geometry used) yields a reliable age for the universe. Assuming the validity of the models used to determine this age, the residual accuracy yields a margin of error near one percent.\n\nIn 2015, the Planck Collaboration estimated the age of the universe to be billion years, slightly higher but within the uncertainties of the earlier number derived from the WMAP data. By combining the Planck data with external data, the best combined estimate of the age of the universe is old. \n\nCalculating the age of the universe is accurate only if the assumptions built into the models being used to estimate it are also accurate. This is referred to as strong priors and essentially involves stripping the potential errors in other parts of the model to render the accuracy of actual observational data directly into the concluded result. Although this is not a valid procedure in all contexts (as noted in the accompanying caveat: \"based on the fact we have assumed the underlying model we used is correct\"), the age given is thus accurate to the specified error (since this error represents the error in the instrument used to gather the raw data input into the model).\n\nThe age of the universe based on the best fit to Planck 2015 data alone is billion years (the estimate of billion years uses Gaussian priors based on earlier estimates from other studies to determine the combined uncertainty). This number represents an accurate \"direct\" measurement of the age of the universe (other methods typically involve Hubble's law and the age of the oldest stars in globular clusters, etc.). It is possible to use different methods for determining the same parameter (in this case – the age of the universe) and arrive at different answers with no overlap in the \"errors\". To best avoid the problem, it is common to show two sets of uncertainties; one related to the actual measurement and the other related to the systematic errors of the model being used.\n\nAn important component to the analysis of data used to determine the age of the universe (e.g. from Planck) therefore is to use a Bayesian statistical analysis, which normalizes the results based upon the priors (i.e. the model). This quantifies any uncertainty in the accuracy of a measurement due to a particular model used.\n\nIn the 18th century, the concept that the age of the Earth was millions, if not billions, of years began to appear. However, most scientists throughout the 19th century and into the first decades of the 20th century presumed that the universe itself was Steady State and eternal, with maybe stars coming and going but no changes occurring at the largest scale known at the time.\n\nThe first scientific theories indicating that the age of the universe might be finite were the studies of thermodynamics, formalized in the mid-19th century. The concept of entropy dictates that if the universe (or any other closed system) were infinitely old, then everything inside would be at the same temperature, and thus there would be no stars and no life. No scientific explanation for this contradiction was put forth at the time.\n\nIn 1915 Albert Einstein published the theory of general relativity and in 1917 constructed the first cosmological model based on his theory. In order to remain consistent with a steady state universe, Einstein added what was later called a cosmological constant to his equations. However, already in 1922, also using Einstein's theory, Alexander Friedmann, and independently five years later Georges Lemaître, showed that the universe cannot be static and must be either expanding or contracting. Einstein's model of a static universe was in addition proved unstable by Arthur Eddington.\n\nThe first direct observational hint that the universe has a finite age came from the observations of 'recession velocities', mostly by Vesto Slipher, combined with distances to the 'nebulae' (galaxies) by Edwin Hubble in a work published in 1929. Earlier in the 20th century, Hubble and others resolved individual stars within certain nebulae, thus determining that they were galaxies, similar to, but external to, our Milky Way Galaxy. In addition, these galaxies were very large and very far away. Spectra taken of these distant galaxies showed a red shift in their spectral lines presumably caused by the Doppler effect, thus indicating that these galaxies were moving away from the Earth. In addition, the farther away these galaxies seemed to be (the dimmer they appeared to us) the greater was their redshift, and thus the faster they seemed to be moving away. This was the first direct evidence that the universe is not static but expanding. The first estimate of the age of the universe came from the calculation of when all of the objects must have started speeding out from the same point. Hubble's initial value for the universe's age was very low, as the galaxies were assumed to be much closer than later observations found them to be.\n\nThe first reasonably accurate measurement of the rate of expansion of the universe, a numerical value now known as the Hubble constant, was made in 1958 by astronomer Allan Sandage. His measured value for the Hubble constant came very close to the value range generally accepted today.\n\nHowever Sandage, like Einstein, did not believe his own results at the time of discovery. His value for the age of the universe was too short to reconcile with the 25-billion-year age estimated at that time for the oldest known stars. Sandage and other astronomers repeated these measurements numerous times, attempting to reduce the Hubble constant and thus increase the resulting age for the universe. Sandage even proposed new theories of cosmogony to explain this discrepancy. This issue was finally resolved by improvements in the theoretical models used for estimating the ages of stars. As of 2013, using the latest models for stellar evolution, the estimated age of the oldest known star is billion years.\n\nThe discovery of microwave cosmic background radiation announced in 1965 finally brought an effective end to the remaining scientific uncertainty over the expanding universe. It was a chance result from work by two teams less than 60 miles apart. In 1964, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson were trying to detect radio wave echoes with a supersensitive antenna. The antenna persistently detected a low, steady, mysterious noise in the microwave region that was evenly spread over the sky, and was present day and night. After testing, they became certain that the signal did not come from the Earth, the Sun, or our galaxy, but from outside our own galaxy, but could not explain it. At the same time another team, Robert H. Dicke, Jim Peebles, and David Wilkinson, were attempting to detect low level noise which might be left over from the Big Bang and could prove whether the Big Bang theory was correct. The two teams realized that the detected noise was in fact radiation left over from the Big Bang, and that this was strong evidence that the theory was correct. Since then, a great deal of other evidence has strengthened and confirmed this conclusion, and refined the estimated age of the universe to its current figure.\n\nThe space probes WMAP, launched in 2001, and Planck, launched in 2009, produced data that determines the Hubble constant and the age of the universe independent of galaxy distances, removing the largest source of error.\n\n"}

It stars Campbell and Embeth Davidtz. It is the third installment in the \"Evil Dead\" franchise, and continuing from \"Evil Dead II,\" Ash Williams (Campbell) is trapped in the Middle Ages and battles the undead in his quest to return to the present.\n\nThe film was produced as part of a production deal with Universal Studios after the financial success of \"Darkman\". Filming took place in California in 1991. The makeup and creature effects for the film were handled by two different companies: Tony Gardner and his company Alterian, Inc. were responsible for the Ash & Sheila makeup effects, while Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group was credited for the remaining special makeup effects characters.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" premiered at the Sitges Film Festival on October 9, 1992, and was released in the United States on February 19, 1993. It grossed $21.5 million total over a $11 million budget, and received positive reviews, though notably less than the first two films. Since its video release it has acquired a cult following, along with the other two films in the trilogy. The film was dedicated to Irvin Shapiro, who died during the film's production in 1989 on New Year's Day.\n\nAfter being transported to the Middle Ages, Ash Williams is captured by Lord Arthur's men, who suspect him an agent for Duke Henry, with whom Arthur is at war. He is enslaved along with the captured Henry, his gun and chainsaw confiscated, and is taken to a castle. Ash is thrown in a pit where he kills a Deadite and regains his weapons from Arthur's Wise Man. After demanding Henry and his men be set free, as he knew it was a witch hunt, and killing a Deadite publicly, Ash is celebrated as a hero. He grows attracted to Sheila, the sister of one of Arthur's fallen knights.\n\nAccording to the Wise Man, the only way Ash can return to his time is through the magical \"Necronomicon Ex-Mortis.\" Ash then starts his search for the \"Necronomicon\". As he enters a haunted forest, an unseen force pursues Ash into a windmill, crashing into a mirror. Small reflections of Ash in the mirror shards come to life, with one becoming a life-sized clone, after which Ash kills and buries it. \n\nWhen he arrives at the \"Necronomicon\"s location, he finds three books instead of one and determines which is the actual book. Attempting to say the phrase that will allow him to remove the book safely \"Klaatu barada nikto\" he forgets and tries to unsuccessfully mumble and cough \"nikto\". He then grabs it and rushes back, while the dead and his evil copy resurrect, uniting into the Army of Darkness.\n\nUpon return, Ash demands to be returned to his own time. However, Sheila is abducted by a Flying Deadite, and later transformed into one. Ash becomes determined to lead the humans against the Army and the people reluctantly agree. Using knowledge from textbooks in his 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88, and enlisting the help of Duke Henry, Ash successfully leads the medieval soldiers to victory over the Deadites and Evil Ash, saving Sheila and bringing peace between Arthur and Henry. The Wise Men tells him how to return to the present by giving him a potion after reciting the phrase.\n\nBack in his present time, Ash recounts his story to a fellow employee at an S-Mart department store. As he talks to a woman who is interested in his story, a surviving Deadite, allowed to come to the present due to Ash again forgetting the last word, attacks the customers. Ash kills it using a Winchester rifle from the Sporting Goods department, and exclaims \"hail to the king, baby\" before passionately kissing the woman. \n\nIn the film's original ending, Ash miscounts the amount of potion needed to be able to correctly return to his own time. As a result, he wakes up in a post-apocalyptic future where human civilization is destroyed, and he screams in dismay at having overslept. Universal Pictures objected to this climax, feeling that it was too negative in tone, and a more optimistic ending was filmed and ultimately incorporated into the theatrical cut.\n\n\nPlans to make a third \"Evil Dead\" film had been circulating for a number of years, even prior to the production of \"Darkman\". \"Evil Dead II\" made enough money internationally that Dino De Laurentiis was willing to finance a sequel. Director and script writer Sam Raimi drew from a variety of sources, including literature with \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\" and Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\" and films like \"The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad\", \"Jason and the Argonauts\", The Three Stooges, and \"Conan The Barbarian\". \"Evil Dead II\", according to Bruce Campbell, \"was originally designed to go back into the past to 1300, but we couldn't muster it at the time, so we decided to make an interim version, not knowing if the 1300 story would ever get made\". Promotional drawings were created and published in \"Variety\" during the casting process before the budget was deemed too little for the plot. The working title for the project was \"Medieval Dead\",before it was later known as\"Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness\". The title \"Army of Darkness\" came from an idea by Irvin Shapiro, during the production of \"Evil Dead II\".\n\nInitially, Raimi invited Scott Spiegel to co-write \"Army of Darkness\" because he had done a good job on \"Evil Dead II\", but he was busy on rewrites for the Clint Eastwood film \"The Rookie\". After the good experience of writing the screenplay for a film called \"Easy Wheels\", Sam and his brother Ivan decided to co-write the film together. They worked on the script throughout the pre-production and production of \"Darkman\". After filming \"Darkman\", they took the script out and worked on it in more detail. Raimi says that Ivan \"has a good sense of character\" and that he brought more comedy into the script. Campbell remembers, \"We all decided, 'Get him out of the cabin.' There were earlier drafts where part three still took place there, but we thought, 'Well, we all know that cabin, it's time to move on.' The three of us decided to keep it in 1300, because it's more interesting\". Campbell and Tapert would read the script drafts, give Raimi their notes and he would decide which suggestions to keep and which ones to discard.\n\nThe initial budget was $8 million but during pre-production, it became obvious that this was not going to be enough. \"Darkman\" was also a financial success and De Laurentiis had a multi-picture deal with Universal and so \"Army of Darkness\" became one of the films. The studio decided to contribute half of the film's $12 million budget. However, the film's ambitious scope and its extensive effects work forced Campbell, Raimi and producer Robert Tapert to put up $1 million of their collective salaries to shoot a new ending and not film a scene where a possessed woman pushes down some giant pillars. Visual effects supervisor William Mesa showed Raimi storyboards he had from Victor Fleming's film \"Joan of Arc\" that depicted huge battle scenes and he picked out 25 shots to use in \"Army of Darkness\". A storyboard artist worked closely with the director in order to blend the shots from the \"Joan of Arc\" storyboards with the battle scenes in his film.\n\nTraci Lords was among the actresses auditioning for the film, saying in 2001, \"I didn't get the part but I clicked with Bruce [Campbell],\" with whom she would later work as a guest star in the TV series \"\".\n\nPrincipal photography took place between soundstage and on-location work. \"Army of Darkness\" was filmed in Bronson Canyon and Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. The interior shots were filmed on an Introvision stage in Hollywood. Raimi's use of the Introvision process was a tribute to the stop-motion animation work of Ray Harryhausen. Introvision uses front-projected images with live actors instead of the traditional rear projection that Harryhausen and others used. Introvision blended components with more realistic-looking results. To achieve this effect, Raimi used 60-foot-tall Scotchlite front-projection screens, miniatures and background plates. According to the director, the advantage of using this technique was \"the incredible amount of interaction between the background, which doesn't exist, and the foreground, which is usually your character\".\n\nShooting began in mid-1991, and it lasted for about 100 days. It was a mid-summer shoot and while on location on a huge castle set that was built near Acton, California on the edge of the Mojave Desert, the cast and crew endured very hot conditions during the day and very cold temperatures at night. Most of the film took place at night and the filmmakers shot most of the film during the summer when the days were longest and the nights were the shortest. It would take an hour and a half to light an area leaving the filmmakers only six hours left to shoot a scene. Money problems forced cinematographer Bill Pope to shoot only for certain hours Monday through Friday because he could not be paid his standard fee. Mesa shot many of the action sequences on the weekend.\n\nIt was a difficult shoot for Campbell who had to learn elaborate choreography for the battle scenes, which involved him remembering a number system because the actor was often fighting opponents that were not really there. Mesa remembers, \"Bruce was cussing and swearing some of the time because you had to work on the number system. Sam would tell us to make it as complicated and hard for Bruce as possible. 'Make him go through torture!' So we'd come up with these shots that were really, really difficult, and sometimes they would take thirty-seven takes\". Some scenes, like Evil Ash walking along the graveyard while his skeleton minions come to life, blended stop-motion animation with live skeletons that were mechanically rigged, with prosthetics and visual effects.\n\nWhile Dino De Laurentiis gave Raimi and his crew freedom to shoot the film the way they wanted, Universal took over during post-production. Universal was not happy with Raimi's cut because it did not like his original ending, feeling it was negative. In this ending, the potion Ash is given causes him to oversleep, and when he wakes up he is a futuristic, post-apocalyptic wasteland. A more upbeat ending was shot a month later in a lumber store in Malibu, California. Then, two months after principal filming was finished, a round of re-shoots began in Santa Monica and involved Ash in the windmill and the scenes with Bridget Fonda. Raimi recalls, \"Actually, I kind of like the fact that there are two endings, that in one alternate universe Bruce is screwed, and in another universe he's some cheesy hero\".\n\nRaimi needed $3 million to finish his film, but Universal was not willing to give him the money and delayed its release due to a dispute with De Laurentiis over the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character which Universal needed so that they could film a sequel to \"The Silence of the Lambs\". The matter was finally resolved, but the release date for \"Army of Darkness\"' was pushed back from summer of 1992 to February 1993.\n\nFor the film's poster, Universal brought Campbell in to take several reference head shots and asked him to strike a sly look on his face. They showed him a rough of the Frank Frazetta-like painting. The actor had a day to approve it or, as he was told, there would be no ad campaign for the film. Raimi ran into further troubles when the Motion Picture Association of America gave it an NC-17 rating for a shot of a female Deadite being decapitated early on in the film. Universal wanted a PG-13 rating, so Raimi made a few cuts and was still stuck with an R rating. In response, Universal turned the film over to outside film editors who cut the film to 81 minutes and another version running 87 minutes that was eventually released in theaters, still with an R rating.\n\nDanny Elfman, who composed the score for \"Darkman\", wrote the \"March of the Dead\" theme for \"Army of Darkness\". After the re-shoots were completed, Joseph LoDuca, who composed the music for \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\", returned to score the film. The composer used his knowledge of synthesizers and was able to present many cues in a mock-up form before he recorded them with the Seattle Symphony. The score was released during the MondoCon in Austin, Texas on October 3 and 4, 2015, on Vinyl, over Mondo Records.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" was released by Universal on February 19, 1993 in 1,387 theaters in the United States, grossing $4.4 million (38.5% of total gross) on its first weekend. In total, the film earned $11.5 million in the US.\n\nThe film currently holds a 72% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 46 reviews, which made its critical reception above average but much lower than \"The Evil Dead\" and \"Evil Dead II\", which received 96% and 98% respectively. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 57 out of 100, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars and wrote, \"The movie isn't as funny or entertaining as \"Evil Dead II\", however, maybe because the comic approach seems recycled.\" In her review for \"The New York Times\", Janet Maslin praised, \"Mr. Campbell's manly, mock-heroic posturing is perfectly in keeping with the director's droll outlook.\" Desson Howe, in this review for \"The Washington Post\" praised the film's style: \"Bill Pope's cinematography is gymnastic and appropriately frenetic. The visual and make-up effects (from artist-technicians William Mesa, Tony Gardner and others) are incredibly imaginative.\" However, \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the film a \"C+\" rating and wrote, \"This spoofy cast of thousands looks a little too much like a crew of bland Hollywood extras. By the time \"Army of Darkness\" turns into a retread of \"Jason and the Argonauts\", featuring an army of fighting skeletons, the film has fallen into a ditch between parody and spectacle.\"\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" won the Saturn Award for Best Horror Film (1994). It was also nominated for Best Make-Up. \"Army of Darkness\" was nominated for the Grand Prize at Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, and won the Golden Raven at the Brussels International Festival of Fantasy Film in 1993. The film also won the Critics' Award at Fantasporto, and was nominated for the International Fantasy Film Award in the category of Best Film in 1993. It was also nominated for Best Film at Sitges, the Spanish International Film Festival.\n\nIn March 2013, shortly before the release of \"Evil Dead\", a reboot and loose continuation of the franchise, Raimi confirmed that the next \"Evil Dead\" film will be \"Army of Darkness 2\". Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older, but not necessarily wiser, Ash. At a WonderCon panel in March 2013, Campbell and Fede Alvarez, director of the reboot, stated that their ultimate plan was for Alvarez's \"Evil Dead 2\" and Raimi's \"Army of Darkness 2\" to be followed by a seventh film which would merge the narratives of Ash and Mia. On October 18, 2013, Campbell once again confirmed in an interview with ComicBook.com that he will be reprising his role as Ash in the sequel. Fede Alvarez posted a status update on his Twitter account that Raimi will direct the sequel. Campbell later commented that the rumor about him returning is false.\n\nIn July 2014, Campbell stated it was likely the planned sequel would instead be a TV series with him as the star. The ten-episode season of \"Ash vs Evil Dead\" premiered on Starz on October 31, 2015, with the pilot co-written and directed by Sam Raimi. Due to legal issues with Universal, the events from \"Army of Darkness\" could not specifically be mentioned in the first season. In addition to Campbell, the series stars Dana DeLorenzo, Ray Santiago, and Lucy Lawless.\n\n\"Army of Darkness\" had a comic book adaptation and several comic book sequels. The movie adaptation, from publisher Dark Horse Comics, was actually published before the film's theatrical release.\n\nEden Studios, Inc. published the \"Army of Darkness Roleplaying Game\" in 2005.\n\n\n\n"}

Organized by A.C.F.F., Ltd., the convention was a nonprofit entity designed to promote the fantasy genre in the American Southeast. Over its two-decade run, the AFF featured hundreds of guests, encompassed hotels in downtown Atlanta and ran thousands of hours of programming for fans of science fiction, fantasy, comic books, and other elements of fandom.\n\nMost AFFs took place over three days, from Friday to Sunday. The convention featured a large range of pop culture elements, primarily comic books but also science fiction/fantasy, film/television, animation, anime, manga, toys, horror, and collectible card games. Along with panels, seminars, and workshops with industry professionals, the AFF often featured previews of upcoming films, and such evening events as a costume contest. The convention featured a large floorspace for exhibitors, including comic book dealers and collectibles merchants.\n\nThe Atlanta Fantasy Fair was a family-friendly event that worked on a \"membership\" basis, which enabled attendees to gain admittance to the show for the entire weekend. The show was known for its program booklet (titled \"Visions\") and for the annual presentation of the Atlanta Fantasy Fair Award for Outstanding Achievement.\n\nThe Atlanta Comics & Fantasy Fair was founded in 1975 by Harley Anton, Lamar Waldron, and Gary Cook. The first convention was held July 22–24, 1975, at the Ramada Inn and Conference Center located near Interstate 85 and Monroe Drive. The guest of honor was Marvel Comics figurehead Stan Lee. The convention offices were in Morrow, Georgia.\n\nDr. Kenneth Smith, a local fantasy illustrator, small-press publisher, and philosophy professor, was a guest of every show from 1975 until 1988, when a dispute with an attendee led to him leaving and not coming back.\n\nBy 1977 the co-chairmen of the convention were Harley Anton, Gary Cook, and Lamar Waldron.\n\nBy 1982, the convention was officially being organized as a nonprofit through the organization Atlanta Comics & Fantasy Fair, Ltd. In 1984, the AFF headquarters were in Marietta, Georgia.\n\nWaldron was displaced as convention chair after the 1986 convention. Terry (alternately spelled as \"Terri\") Loggins was convention president from 1986-1989. In 1989, the AFF headquarters were in Norcross, Georgia.\n\nThe Atlanta Fantasy Fair, Inc. registered as a Georgia Domestic Non-Profit Corporation on August 12, 1991. Their headquarters were in Stockbridge, Georgia, and the two principals were listed as CEO (Felton) Wayne Loggins and CFO David Denton.\n\nBy the early 1990s, attendance at AFF was declining, in many ways due to competition with the also Atlanta-based Dragon Con (est. 1987), as well as the collapse of the comic speculator market. The quality of guests began to decline and the show petered out in 1995.\n\nFormer Atlanta Fantasy Fair co-organizer Wayne Loggins attempted to rebrand the convention the next year, producing Atlanta StarCon & Comics on November 1–3, 1996. Held at the Atlanta Marriott North Central Hotel, the show boasted such guests as George Pérez, Michael O'Hare, Kane Hodder, Frank Marshall, and Kathleen Kennedy. Programming included a party at Planet Hollywood, a masquerade contest, meals \"with the stars,\" a dealer room, and gaming. The show was not enough of a success to continue the following year.\n\nFrom 1979–1987, the convention produced \"Visions,\" a program booklet given out to convention attendees. Each issue of the AFF zine highlighted that year's special guests, publishing biographies and checklists of their work. Each issue also featured pinup illustrations by professional and amateur artists. \"Visions\" was published by convention organizers Gary Cook and Lamar Waldron, and then, beginning with issue #4 (1982), under the name Atlanta Comics & Fantasy Fair, Ltd. \"Visions\" was edited by Lamar Waldron and was typically 12\" x 9\" in size.\n\n\"Visions\" #1 (1979) features the first appearance of Bob Burden's Flaming Carrot. \"Visions\" #3 (1981) contains an extremely rare early Flaming Carrot story by Burden.\n\nThe AFF published 4,000 copies of \"Visions\" #4 (1982), which contained a Frank Miller Batman pinup, a Miller checklist, a Forrest J Ackerman article written by Robert Bloch, artwork by Ray Harryhausen and Will Eisner, and the fourth appearance of Burden's Flaming Carrot.\n\n\"Visions\" #5 featured checklists of the books of Robert Bloch and Larry Niven, and \"Remembering Boris Karloff\" by Forrest J Ackerman. The cover depicted model Susan Barrow (a.k.a. Susie the Floozie).\n\nIn 1982 the Atlanta Fantasy Fair Award for Outstanding Achievement was established, bestowed for lifetime achievement in the fields of science fiction, fantasy, horror, comics, and related fields in any medium. The prize (sculpted by Edward Knox) was a sterling silver statuette of \"Miss Fantasy Fair,\" with an elaborate headdress and a diamond in one eye.\n\nWinners were required to be present to claim the award, or it would pass to the next choice. The inaugural recipient was science fiction and fantasy fan, spokesman, and promoter Forrest J Ackerman.\n\n"}

He was the author of several army manuals on duties and customs eventually adopted by the U.S. military.\n\nBorn in Ispringen, Baden, Germany, Kautz immigrated with his parents to Brown County, Ohio in 1832. He later enlisted as a Private in the 1st Ohio Infantry, serving in the Mexican–American War from 1846 to 1847.\n\nEntering the United States Military Academy following the war, Kautz graduated in the class of 1852. He primarily served at Fort Steilacoom in the Pacific Northwest, where he was wounded twice with the 4th U.S. Infantry during Rogue River Wars with Indians along the Rogue River in 1855, and also served in the Puget Sound War in 1856. He was rewarded with a commission as a lieutenant in the regular army.\n\nOn July 16, 1857, Kautz made what is sometimes credited as the first ascent of Mount Rainier. Kautz is reported as having climbed to the edge of Rainier's crater rim, but as he did not make the final walk to Rainier's Columbia Crest, his ascent has often been described as incomplete.\n\nDuring his time in the Pacific Northwest, Kautz became a supporter of Chief Leschi, who was executed in 1858. Kautz believed the execution was illegal and that Leschi should have been considered a prisoner of war. Shortly before Leschi's execution, Kautz published two issues of a newspaper defending him. The newspaper was called the \"Truth Teller\", and its masthead stated: \"Devoted to the Dissemination of Truth and the Suppression of Humbug.\"\n\nFrom 1859 to 1860, he traveled in Europe. In August 1860, under Major George A. H. Blake's command, he traveled with recruits on a march from Fort Benton to Fort Vancouver, commanding a detachment of 150 recruits, which broke off from the main group at Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to begin service at Colville Depot, Washington Territory. He returned to the Eastern United States in April 1861, shortly after the outbreak of hostilities between the Union and Confederacy.\n\nKautz was a captain with the 6th U.S. Cavalry during the Peninsula Campaign from April to July 1862. Transferred to the Western Theater, Kautz later assisted in operations as a colonel with the 2nd Ohio Cavalry against Confederate General John Hunt Morgan's highly successful raid behind Union lines in Indiana and Ohio during June–July 1863 and under the command of Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside at the Battle of Knoxville from September to December 1863.\n\nPromoted to brigadier general of volunteers on April 16, 1864, Kautz led cavalry operations under the command of Maj. Gen. Benjamin Butler during Ulysses S. Grant's campaigns against Richmond and Petersburg between April and June 1864. His cavalry division was a part of the Army of the James and was forced to withdraw from its position at White's Tavern following an attack by parts of Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard H. Anderson's Corps. On December 12, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln nominated Kautz for appointment to the brevet grade of major general of volunteers, to rank from October 28, 1864, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on February 14, 1865. He was mustered out of the volunteers on January 15, 1866. On July 17, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Kautz for appointment to the brevet grade of major general, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.\n\nIn early April 1865, Kautz marched into Richmond in command of a division of colored troops which belonged to Godfrey Weitzel's XXV Corps. He was active during the Union pursuit of Robert E. Lee from April 2 to April 9, 1865, until Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House.\n\nAfter the war, Kautz served (from May to June 1865) on the trial board investigating the conspirators involved in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, before performing extensive service in the southwest frontier, including as the commander of the Department of Arizona and commanding officer of Fort McDowell. He was appointed commander of the Department of the Columbia in July 1891 with the rank of brigadier general. After leaving military service in 1892, he lived in retirement until his death at Seattle, Washington. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was rebuilt in 1802 according to the designs of the architect Thomas de Thomon and renamed the Bolshoi, but burned down in 1811. The building was restored in 1818, and modified between 1826 and 1836 by Alberto Cavos to accommodate more modern machinery.\n\nUntil 1886, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was principal theatre for both the Imperial Ballet and the Imperial Russian Opera. It was there that the first Russian operas — Glinka's \"A Life for the Tsar\" and \"Ruslan and Lyudmila\" — were premiered. Although the theatre would include many of the great Russian operas in its repertory, many of the works of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their world premieres on the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Many of the great 19th century ballets of Marius Petipa and Arthur Saint-Léon were given for the first time on the stage of the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre.\n\nIn 1886 the building was declared unsafe and, at the behest of the theatre director Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the ballet and opera performances moved to the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, where they have remained ever since.

The CPFF was created on 27 October 2008 and funded a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that purchased three-month unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper (CP) from eligible issuers. This resulted in greater availability of credit for firms doing business. It worked under the aegis of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York where the NY Fed finances the purchase of highly rated unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper from eligible issuers via eligible primary dealers. The facility expired February 1, 2010. The final CP purchased matured on April 26, 2010. All CP notes purchased were repaid in full.\n\nThe CPFF began operations on October 27, 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers and government bailout of AIG and the global credit freeze that ensued. The CPFF method of short-term funding provided liquidity to U.S. issuers of commercial paper through an SPV, which bought unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper for three-month period from eligible issuers with funds made available by the NY Fed. The commercial paper remained in the custody of the SPV until the CP matured. On maturity, the proceeds from commercial paper and other assets were used to repay the loan that was originally taken from the NY Fed. All purchases of the Commercial Papers by the SPV was done through the New York Fed’s primary dealers. This program lent out a total $738 billion before it was closed. 45 out 81 of the companies participating in this program were foreign firms. Research shows that Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) recipients were twice as likely to participate in the program than other commercial paper issuers who did not take advantage of the TARP bailout. The Fed incurred no losses from the CPFF.\n\nThis program was created at the same time that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program to increase liquidity in inter-bank lending.\n\nOnly \"Active\" U.S. issuers of commercial paper (including those with a foreign parent), were eligible to sell commercial paper to the SPV. Active was defined as having at least three consecutive months of commercial paper outstanding during the period starting January 1, 2008 through August 31, 2008.\n\nThe commercial paper had to be rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by a major nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) and, if rated by multiple major NRSROs, must have been rated at least A-1/P-1/F1 by two or more major NRSROs.\n\nAs part of the application process to be eligible for this program issuers had to pay a 10 basis point (0.1%) fee based on their maximum CP balance during the active period mentioned above.\n\n"}

It first opened in the summer of 1995, and emerged as Nintendo’s biggest online event. Camp Hyrule, which was usually held in August, allowed Nintendo fanatics to chat, play online games, and win prizes under the supervision of Nintendo employees and \"Nintendo Power\" columnists. The camp's name is eponymous to the fictional land of Hyrule, a prominent and recurring setting in \"The Legend of Zelda\" series. The last camp was in 2007, with no plans to host another Camp Hyrule.\n\nEssentially an online simulation of a summer camp, Camp Hyrule had refined many traditional outdoor themes, such as campfires, water sports, and archery into many Java-based games. Participants were assigned to cabins, where they worked with other teammates to earn points by participating in games, Photoshop contests, and other activities. After the camp session ended, the cabin with the most points won a special prize, while runner-up cabins received other consolation prizes.\n\nThe camp was also used to promote various Nintendo-related products. In past years, some of the camp's games have revolved around \"1080° Avalanche\", the Game Boy Advance SP, and \"Donkey Konga.\" Additionally, the camp had a theme, related to an upcoming video game, that often prompted mini-story line. For example, in 2005, the camp's design and layout reflected the upcoming \"\". Nintendo went to further detail to add a story line to that camp session, in which games and layouts were mysteriously vanishing at the hands of an evil force. Nevertheless, all the issues were always resolved at the camp's closing ceremony, where awards and grand prize winners were announced.\n\nCamp Hyrule was moderated and maintained by Nintendo of America's online staff. Staff members, called counselors, were responsible for moderating their assigned cabin’s message board and chat rooms, while also advocating participants to earn points. The camp’s staff also sent participants daily emails pertaining to earning points or the camp’s plot developments. In recent years, Nintendo had turned to the \"NSider Forums\", their official online community, in order to provide additional moderators. Camp Hyrule also had a mascot, named Stumpy, who was often seen wandering the campgrounds.\n\nThe community elements were removed from Camp Hyrule in 2007, coinciding with the closing of the NSider forums and the impending switch from in-house publication of Nintendo Power to publication by Future US, which occurred in November 2007.\n\nUnless announced otherwise, Nintendo usually opened registration for Camp Hyrule in late July or early August. Although there was no limit as to how many users could sign up, registration was only open for one week. To register, one first needed to acquire a \"My Nintendo\" account (which Nintendo has since phased out to bring Club Nintendo to the US), and then visit the official Camp Hyrule website for further instructions.\n\nThe 2007 year camp was open from August 13 to August 23 to all My Nintendo members, and registration was not required.\n\nCamp Hyrule features several landmarks which have appeared year after year on the campgrounds:\n\n\n"}

The term also can refer to very specific seating, such as the \"takamikura\" (高御座) throne in the Shishin-den at Kyoto Imperial Palace.\n\nVarious other thrones or seats that are used by the Emperor during official functions, such as those used in the Tokyo Imperial Palace or the throne used in the Speech from the Throne ceremony in the National Diet, are, however, not known as the \"Chrysanthemum Throne\".\n\nIn a metonymic sense, the \"Chrysanthemum Throne\" also refers rhetorically to the head of state and the institution of the Japanese monarchy itself.\n\nJapan is the oldest continuing hereditary monarchy in the world. In much the same sense as the British Crown, the Chrysanthemum Throne is an abstract metonymic concept that represents the monarch and the legal authority for the existence of the government. Unlike its British counterpart, the concepts of Japanese monarchy evolved differently before 1947 when there was, for example, no perceived separation of the property of the nation-state from the person and personal holdings of the Emperor.\n\nAccording to legend, the Japanese monarchy is said to have been founded in 660 BC by Emperor Jimmu; Akihito is the 125th monarch to occupy the Chrysanthemum Throne. The extant historical records only reach back to Emperor Ōjin, who is considered to have reigned into the early 4th century. \nThe chrysanthemum is a symbol of the emperor and the imperial house. In particular, a \"chrysanthemum crest\" (菊花紋章, \"kikukamonshō\" or\" kikkamonshō\"), i.e. a \"mon\" of chrysanthemum blossom design, indicates a link to the emperor. Notable uses of and reference to the imperial chrysanthemum include the Imperial Seal of Japan, a number of formerly state-endowed shrines (官国弊社, \"kankokuheisha\") have adopted a chrysanthemum crest, and the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum. \n\nThe current Constitution of Japan considers the Emperor as \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.\" The modern Emperor is a constitutional monarch. The metonymic meanings of \"Chrysanthemum Throne\" encompass the modern monarchy and the chronological list of legendary and historical monarchs of Japan.\n\nThe throne is located in the Kyoto Imperial Palace. It is the oldest surviving throne used by the monarchy. It sits on an octagonal dais, above the floor. It is separated from the rest of the room by a curtain. The sliding door that hides the Emperor from view is called the , and has an image of 32 celestial saints painted upon it, which became one of the primary models for all of Heian period painting. The throne is used mainly for the enthronement ceremony, along with the twin throne .\n\nThis flexible English term is also a rhetorical trope. Depending on context, the Chrysanthemum Throne can be construed as a metonymy, which is a rhetorical device for an allusion relying on proximity or correspondence, as for example referring to actions of the Emperor or as \"actions of the Chrysanthemum Throne.\" The Chrysanthemum throne is also understood as a synecdoche, which is related to metonymy and metaphor in suggesting a play on words by identifying a closely related conceptualization, e.g.,\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the State Visit in 2007 of the Emperor and Empress of Japan to the United Kingdom, the \"Times\" reported that \"last night’s dinner was as informal as it could get when the House of Windsor entertains the Chrysanthemum Throne.\"\n\n\n\n"}

Located in the civil parish of Condeixa-a-Velha e Condeixa-a-Nova, in the municipality of Condeixa-a-Nova, it is situated from the municipal seat and from Coimbra (the Roman town of \"Aeminium\").\n\nConímbriga is a walled urban settlement, encircled by a curtain of stone structures approximately long. Entrance to the settlement is made from vaulted structures consisting of two doors (one on hinges), and at one time was defended by two towers. The walls are paralleled by two passages, channelled to excavations, in order to remove water infiltration from the walls. The urban settlement consists of various structures such as a forum, basilica and commercial shops, thermal spas, aqueducts, insulae, homes of various heights (including interior patios) and domus (such as the \"Casa dos Repuxos\" and \"Casa de Cantaber\"), in addition to paleo-Christian basilica.\n\nA visitors' centre (which includes restaurant/café and gift-shop) was constructed to display objects found by archaeologists during their excavations, including coins, surgical tools, utensils and ceramics.\n\nLike many archaeological sites, Conímbriga was evolved sequentially and built up by successive layers, with the primary period of occupation beginning in the 9th century; during this period the area was occupied by a Castro culture. Before the Roman occupation, the Conii peoples (who would later settle in southern Portugal) occupied the settlement. The Conímbriga designation came from \"conim\", used by pre-European indigenous to designate \"the place of rocky eminence\", and \"briga\", the Celtic suffix meaning \"citadel\". This site had become a junction between the road that linked Olisipo to Bracara Augusta, by way of Aeminium (Coimbra).\n\nAround 139 BC, Romans began arriving in the area, as a consequence of the expeditionary campaigns of Decimus Junius Brutus. At the time, Conímbriga was already a built-up settlement. The Romans introduced the formal organization of space to the settlement. Owing to the peaceful nature of rural Lusitania, Romanisation of the indigenous population was quick and Conímbriga, inevitably, became a prosperous town.\n\nBetween 69 and 79 AD, during the reign of Vespasian, Conímbriga was elevated to the status of \"municipium\". At that time, new urban programs were initiated. Judging by the capacity of the amphitheatre, by this time, the city had an estimated population of approximately 10600. Many of the new colonists came from the Italian peninsula (like the Lucanus, Murrius, Vitellius and Aponia families) and intermarried with local inhabitants (such as the Turrania, Valeria, Alios and Maelo families).\n\nConstruction of the \"Casa dos Repuxos\" began in the 2nd century, likely over a pre-existing structure. At the end of the 3rd century, the Augustian walls were replaced by the existing structures. In addition there was a remodelling of the baths and construction of a majority of the larger homes of the town, leading to the construction of the paleo-Christian basilica in the 4th century.\n\nBetween 465 and 468, invasions by Sueves caused the destruction of the city, and its inhabitants dispersed, some into slavery.\n\nThe bishopric of Conímbriga was established between 561 and 572, under the direction of Lucêncio, its first bishop. By 589, Conímbriga ceased to be the episcopal seat, and was transferred to Aeminium, which later became Coimbra.\n\nDuring the reign of King Manuel (1519), the king ordered the inscriptions on the facade of the Church of Condeixa-a-Nova.\n\nIn the 18th century, Conímbriga was first referred to in parochial documents, resulting in the 1869 visit by Hubner to the site. In 1873, the \"Instituto de Coimbra\" (\"Coimbra Institute\") was created, in addition to the formation of a museum dedicated to archaeology, instigating the first formal excavations at Conímbriga in 1873. Mosaics were removed from the uncovered homes and the first excavations were made in 1899, resulting in the plan for the oppidum.\n\nIn 1911, the Coimbra Institute ceded its collection to the Museum Machado de Castro, resulting in the beginnings of the studies by Augusto Filipe Simões and António Augusto Gonçalves.\n\nOn the occasion of the 11th International Congress on Archaeology and Pre-History (1930) in Portugal, the state acquired the first lands and official excavations on the site. At the time of this congress the eastern gates to the city were unobstructed. The following year the DGEMN started the work of reconstructing and consolidating the ruins, which were continued in 1955.\n\nIn 1956, there were archaeological studies of \"Oppidum Romano\", by the \"Serviços dos Monumentos Nacionais\" (\"National Monument Service\"). New excavations occurred in 1964.\n\nIn 1962, the \"Museu Monográfico de Conímbriga\" (\"Conímbriga Monographic Museum\") was inaugurated. It was followed in 1964 by the collaboration between this museum and the archaeological mission from the University of Bordeaux: under the direction of J. Bairrão Oleiro, Robert Étienne and Jorge de Alarcão, the centre of the Roman city was unearthed.\n\nIn 1970, the work with the mosaics was consolidated, at a time when the monograph museum was expanded (with a basement, installations for a guard and interior shelter). But, throughout the transition to Portuguese democracy and beyond, the team at Conímbriga attempted to consolidate and maintain the site. The early work continued into 1974, with the consolidation, restoration and expansion of the museum and 1975, with the prospecting into other zones, the paving of walkways, landscaping and solutions to drainage issues. In 1976, the gazebo and interior of the older Monographic Museum was repaired. These repairs continued into 1977, with expansion of the museum, restoration of the facades, the old portico and the colonnade was transformed into an internal gallery, the arrangement of the principal atrium and creating a gutters to alleviate pedestrian walkways. The following year began the construction of a ticket booth in cement and glass, while in 1979 an electrical transformer and litter incineration unit was installed. The installation of electrical devices, illumination and climate control units in the museum only occurred between 1981 and 1982. In 1986 a new awning was installed to cover the \"Casa dos Repuxos\".\n\nThe first permanent public exposition was opened in April 1985.\n\nDuring the 1990s, there were projects to remodel the museum and upgrade the displays and various installations to support visitors, under the direction of Cruz Alarcão, Arquitectos Lda. They were re-contracted between 2004-2005 to improve the site, including the reconstruction of the Augustian forum and southern thermal spas, construction of a small structure for spectacles (consisting of a roadway, stage and bunks molded to the terrain), alongside the aqueduct.\n\nOn 9 August 1991, the museum became part of the \"Instituto Português de Museus\" (\"Portuguese Institute for Museums\"), leading to the 1 June 1992 transfer to the \"Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico\" (IPPAR), and then on 29 March 2007, the \"Instituto dos Museus e Conservação\" (\"Institute for Museums and Conservation\").\n\nThe excavation site and visitors' centre is located on the outskirts of the rural community of Condeixa-a-Nova, based on a plateau-shaped triangular spur over two deep depressions (one occupied by the Ribeira dos Mouros).\n\nAlthough Conimbriga was not the largest Roman city in Portugal, it is the best preserved, with archaeologists estimating that only 10 percent of the city has been excavated.\n\nThe urbanized civitas includes integrated structures starting from the Iron Age and extending to the 5th century. There were specifically three phases of spatial organization: in the 1st century BC, under the reign of Augustus, a late republican forum (that included crypto-portico, basilica, curia and commercial shops), thermal baths, an aqueduct and the first residential pre-Roman architectural structures; a 1st-century AD group, established under Flavius, that included a reconstructed imperial forum, Vitruvian baths and revised urban plan; and a 3rd-century settlement that fell within revised walls.\n\nThe civil/residential buildings included numerous examples of remodeled and reused structures dating from the first century BC. Most of these homes were insulae (houses with more than one floor), with open patio/courtyards and domus with peristyle (such as the \"Casa dos Repuxos\" and \"Casa de Cantaber\"). Most of the private/civil architecture and public buildings included abundant decorative materials, including mosaics, sculptures and painted murals.\n\nOf the Suebic occupation, there is a paleo-Christian basilica (5th-6th century), which was a reused and transformed domus. The robust, rustic walls imply an urgency in its construction. It was built using large, carved, irregular blocks, with most coming from other constructions. The height of the walls vary from to , suggesting the significance of its military feasibility.\n\nThere are three distinct baths within the walls: the Great Southern Baths, the Baths of the Wall, and the Baths of the Aqueduct. The network of stone heating ducts under the (now-missing) floors are the most distinct structures in the Roman baths.\n\nThe amphitheatre, dating from the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, takes advantage of a natural depression that surrounded the city to the north. The first was identified in 1993 by Virgílio H. Correia, and excavations began in 2012-2013. Part of the amphitheatre was located below local homes in Condeixa-a-Nova, consisting of three entranceways to the Roman structure. The 5000-capacity monument was , and underground, with some rural homes built using part of the structure.\n\nThe Luso-French mission (1965-1968) unearthed public structures of great dimensions, whose architecture was reconstructed. This included two phases, where the first structures can not be reconstructed with certainty. These Flavian monuments coincide with the location of some important elements, such as the central square.\n\n\n\n"}

During the Second World War he made seventeen attempts at escaping from POW camps, including several attempts to escape from Colditz Castle, a castle that housed prisoners of war \"deemed incorrigible.\"\n\nFamed for his time in Colditz, Bruce also escaped from Spangenberg Castle and the Warburg POW camp. In Spangenberg Castle he escaped with the \"Swiss Red Cross Commission escape,\" it is also argued he co-innovated the wooden horse escape technique whilst serving time inside Spangenberg. In Warburg he escaped dressed as a British orderly in a fake workers party. Inside Colditz Castle, Bruce authored the \"Tea Chest Escape\" and also faced a firing squad for an attempted escape via a sewer tunnel. Whilst held in solitude in Colditz, along with two other prisoners, Bruce became a key witness to the post war Musketoon, commando raid trial.\n\nFor his exploits in WWII he was awarded the Military Cross and is the only known person to have received both the Military Cross and the Air Force Medal.\n\nIn his later years he received the OBE for his services to education.\n\nBruce was born on 7 June 1915, in Hebburn, County Durham, England. He was the second of the four children of William and Mary Bruce. Mary (née McClurry) Bruce was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1956 for her services to the care of the sick and infirm and was known as the 'Angel of Hebburn'. His older brother was Brother Thomas (William) Bruce , a member of the De La Salle religious congregation or Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools who died in Nazareth in 1974, and is buried in a wall tomb in the crypt of the University of Bethlehem. His two younger siblings were Anne Bruce-Kimber and John Bruce (who died in infancy). Dominic Bruce's escaping adventures started early in his life when he ran away from home by means of a train to London. Remarkably on arrival in London he was recognised by a police officer married to his father's sister Anne. He was quickly returned to Shakespeare Avenue in Hebburn. Bruce was educated at and matriculated from St Cuthbert's Grammar School, Newcastle, 1927-1935. He was of an adventurous disposition and as an alternative to his formal education he spent some time as an unauthorised visitor to the Newcastle law courts during school time. \n\nBruce married Mary Brigid Lagan on 25 June 1938 at Corpus Christi Catholic Church, Maiden Lane, London, WC2.\n\nOn joining the Royal Air Force in 1935 he trained as an wireless operator, then as an airgunner. In November 1936 Bruce joined No. 214 Squadron at Scampton. Scampton was equipped with Virginias and Harrows. On 25 March 1937 he was involved in the crash of the Handley Page Harrow \"K6940\" which resulted from a badly judged descent which removed the roof of a train travelling on railway lines adjacent to the Handley Page works airfield at Radlett.\n\nOn 6 October 1938, while with No. 214 Squadron, he survived the crash of Harrow \"K6991\" at Pontefract, Yorkshire. While acting as a wireless operator for his aircraft he was knocked out by a lightning strike. Once recovered he alerted his base to the fact that the crew were bailing out. Wishing to get out of an escape hatch he found his way blocked by other airmen who were hesitating about throwing themselves out of the aircraft into the howling darkness. He rushed to the other side of the hatch and jumped. His parachute harness caught on projecting clamps and pulled the trapdoor shut above him. Bruce was now suspended under the bomber and unable to escape further. Realising what had happened his fellow crew members were now galvanised into action raised the trapdoor and were shocked to have Bruce shoot back into the aircraft, though not too shocked to eject him again. Bruce was subsequently awarded the Air Force Medal (AFM) on 8 June 1939. According to Pete Tunstall, Bruce was very proud of being the only man known to have bailed from an aircraft three times and to have landed only twice. After the war he used to entertain his children with the seemingly insoluble riddle: \"How is it that I baled out three times, but only landed twice?\" Bruce called his AFM medal the 'Away From Mam' medal.\n\nIn March 1939 Bruce retrained as an air observer and studied at the Bombing School Stranrear. \n\nAt the outbreak of war, in 1939, and following his training, Bruce was an instructor at OTU Harwell. In May 1940 he was posted to No. 9 Squadron which was equipped with Vickers Wellingtons. After 25 operations, Bruce became the squadron’s Navigation and Bombing Leader, which was a staff appointment with restricted operational flying duties. By 1940, Bruce, had won an AFM, was part of the staff, was a qualified instructor, had experience as a Wireless Operator, had experience as an air-gunner and now had experience as a Navigator with the RAF No.9 Squadron. The mortality risk for RAF Bomber Command aircrew in World War II was significant. One of his roles as a navigator would have involved keeping the aircraft on course at all times. He would have had to have had a high level of concentration as missions could last up to seven hours. His account (including a photo of the actual handwritten report) of a bombing raid, on military infrastructure in Leverkusen in 1940 can be read in 'Voices of Colditz.' The report describes the aircraft swinging around Cologne on a moonlight night, Bruce using the silver river Rhine as the navigational signpost; how the guns were firing more to make it look like a raid than to hit the aircraft; and how the run up in this raid was textbook. He finishes the report, mentioning the parking in the hanger; highlighting his workload filling up his bulky navigators satchel and how he sadly climbed out of the plane on to nothing, resulting in him receiving a sprained ankle.\n\nOn 20 January 1941 Acting Flight Sergeant Bruce was granted a commission \"for the duration of hostilities\" as a probationary pilot officer, with seniority from 8 January. By June 1941 Bruce had been promoted to Flying Officer. \n\n Bruce was a notorious prankster. In Pat Reid's book about Colditz he describes how a group of new Navy entrants to the castle were horrified when a uniformed German doctor (in fact, Howard Gee, one of the 'prominente' hostages) insisted that they were lice ridden and must strip naked for their private parts be treated by his medical orderly. This alarming figure in white overalls would approach each man with a lavatory brush dipped in a bucket of evil smelling blue liquid (consisting of lavatory disinfectant and theatrical paint) and dabbed each man's genitals. The new boys would later realise that the evilly grinning orderly was Bruce.\n\nIn the IWM interview tapes held in the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive, Bruce tells the tale of a bombing mission over Berlin when he persuaded the pilot to descend to five hundred feet over the city. Bruce climbed down into the now empty bomb bay, hand cranked the doors open; sat on the bomb rack and threw a lit distress flare out of the plane. When asked later why, he answered \"Because I've always wanted to see the Unter den Linden lit up at night.\"\n\nBruce, like a lot of his comrades, participated in goon baiting. In his book 'Colditz: the German Story' (1961, translation by Howard Gee), Reinhold Eggers, the castle's Security Officer, describes how Bruce was fond of sowing confusion amongst the German guards during Appel, or roll call, using the 'rabbit run' prank. Bruce would stand in the ranks, wait until he had been counted, then duck quickly along the line, only to be counted again at the other end. This trick was also used for more serious purposes, to cover up for a missing escapee.\n\nJohn 'Bosun' Chrisp explained that after their sewer drain escape attempt, Bruce, billed the Kommandant and Staff Paymaster Heinze in the castle for £600 on behalf of Messrs Chrisp, Lorraine and Bruce, for their service of cleaning the drains that had not been cleaned for 300 years.\n\nIn his IWM interview tapes he tells how he fooled the King's cousin Viscount Lascelles (later the Earl of Harewood, he was being kept in Colditz as a hostage by the SS) into believing that the average or medium size of home sapiens was 5 feet 3 inches (his own height). When Lascelles told his mess mates about this novel theory it did not take them long to discover who had fooled him. That resulted in his nickname, 'the Medium Sized Man.' Bruce was also known as the 'Medium Sized Officer.'He was also was known as 'Brucie' or 'Bruce.'\n\nDuring his failed escape under the wire at Colditz he discovered his German nickname, as the guard who fell over him in the dark (and in his fright shot at Bruce, just barely missing his eyebrow) answered the security patrol's question as to who it was by saying 'Der Kleine' ('the little one'). The sentry overcame his shock only to burst out laughing when Bruce shouted \"I surrender\" in an effort to prevent him shooting again. When he emerged from his six-week sentence in solitary confinement he asked another prisoner, Cyril Lewthwaite, who spoke excellent German, if he could explain the guard's odd reaction. Lewthwaite asked Bruce what he had said in German. Bruce obliged, whereupon Lewthwaite pointed out that \"Ich ueber gebe mich\" does not in fact mean \"I surrender\" but \"I am going to be sick\" (taken from a private letter to Peter Tunstall dated 5 September 1979).\n\nOver forty percent of those in the RAF were killed in action in WWII. Bruce and his comrades in RAF Bomber Command would have had to have \"nerves of steel.\"\nNotoriously short tempered (his father 'Billie' Bruce was supposed to be the 'worst tempered man in the North of England') he was described as 'as hard as nails' by his fellow Spangenberg inmate, Squadron Leader Eric Foster, in his autobiography. Foster's autobiography is also an eye witness source for the Swiss Red Cross Commission escape at Spangenberg Castle. Tunstall explained Bruce was very meticulous, and gave plaudits to him by describing him as having the draw of a big personality. After the Swiss commission escape, Tunstall also claimed that compared to him with his bad ankle, Bruce and Newborn had mental toughness to keep going whilst on the march; and that of the three Bruce, with his stamina, was the pacesetter.\nIngenious he may have been, but not all Bruce's escape ideas were successful. The Colditz dentist, Julius Green (in his book 'From Colditz in Code') tells the story of an escape attempt that was a little too ingenious. Bruce persuaded a friend, Rex Harrison of the Green Howards, who was six feet five inches, to carry him inside his long greatcoat from a series of straps. Rex was to carry a football under his arm, into which Bruce would put his head using a hole cut into the back of the football. The idea was simple. Harrison would exit the castle to go the exercise park below the castle walls with Bruce clinging to his waist. Once in the park, accomplices would create a distraction, Bruce would slip out from under Harrison's coat, and then hide under a pile of leaves. When the guards counted the prisoners as they re-entered the castle, the count would be identical to the number who went out. Unfortunately, while the duo were practising the escape on a staircase, another inmate came rushing down the stairs, crashed into Harrison, and all three went tumbling down the staircase. Bruce reluctantly abandoned the idea.\n\n On 9 June 1941, while navigating a Wellington bomber over the North Sea, on a mission to bomb enemy shipping on the Dutch and Belgium coast, his aircraft was shot down by, what was thought to be, two Bf 109’s. The Bf 109’s were first encountered four miles from Calais. Black smoke was seen coming out of the Wellington.\n\nThe area in which the Wellington was shot down was hazardous. From 1939 to 31 December 1942 1497, sailors, airmen and soldiers were either killed or went missing in that area, with over 370 aircraft losses counted. Of the No. 9 Squadrons four Wellington planes on this operation only two come back. In total 18 aircraft took part in this raid.\n\nJust prior to this raid, Bruce had previously flown three operations with three various scratch crews. On this raid Bruce also formed part of another scratch crew. The crew included: Bruce, Wing Commander pilot Roy Arnold, air-gunner Thomas Albert Bax, air-gunner Sgt. R. H. Barratt who was also from staff, Sgt. James Murray Pinkham and Sgt. Harold Arthur Wink. Wing Commander Arnold lost his life. The pilot Wing Commander Roy Arnold bravely and calmly stayed at the controls of the burning Wellington, at low height, in order to keep it steady and allow the other five crew members to escape. He did this in the certain knowledge that he would die doing so. He was thirty years old and married. Arnold is buried in the CWG cemetery at Blankenberge, Belgium. The story of his heroic act of self-sacrifice did not emerge until after the war when the crew returned from captivity and could tell their squadron commander.\n\nThe 9 squadrons other Wellington (R2620) lost in this raid resulted in 2 deaths, 3 airmen being noted as missing in action and one airman noted as surviving. The Luftwaffe airman who claimed shooting down the Wellington (R1758) was Walter \"Jap\" Schneider. Jap would also become a fatality of warfare when flying over Abbeville France in 1941. \n\nIn WW2, the survival rates for bailing out into the sea were not great with roughly one third surviving and despite the fact that he could not swim, Bruce, with at least air-gunner Thomas Bax, baled out into the sea, hoping to allow the current to wash him south towards France and the resistance life lines that had been established there. However, motor launches were quickly despatched from the port and he was picked by the German Navy in the sea near Zeebrugge. He earned membership of the \"Caterpillar Club\" as a result of this exit from a \"disabled aircraft\" as can be seen from his wearing of the Club tie in the photo taken in 1995 at RAF Fairford (right).\n\nOn the day of the raid Bruce had told his wife he would be back for tea. Bruce would later write, \"This was a silly daylight raid... with no escort against enemy fighters.\" Bruce became a casualty of this raid suffering burns. Documents also highlight a comrade, the Australian air-gunner Thomas Bax became a casualty of warfare. Bax would eventually be repatriated because of the seriousness of his condition. After capture Bruce was sent to Dulag Luft, where from the camp he was immediately sent to Hohemark for treatment for burns.\n\nInformation exchange in WWII was slow, with a reliance on telegram. At first, it was thought that all the crew had died as a result of their Wellington being shot down. The father of 9 Squadrons Thomas Bax received a telegram on the 3 July 1941 explaining that his son was a POW and no longer missing. Later, on the 19 August 1941, the Red Cross received information that Bax had been sent to Spangenberg. It was similar for Bruce. After two weeks without news, the International Red Cross sent a message to his wife, Mary Lagan Bruce, that her husband was in fact alive. In recordings, now lodged in the Oral History Sound Archive of the British Library, she tells how that she had been utterly convinced that he was alive, despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\n On the 23 June 1941 Bruce was sent to Oflag IX-A/H, a German prisoner of war camp at Spangenberg Castle. Spangenberg Castle () is a \"schloss\" above the small German town of Spangenberg in the North Hesse county of Schwalm-Eder-Kreis. He was also awaiting trial after being involved with an altercation with an overzealous guard in Dulag Luft. Inside the castle he would be joined by the injured No. 9 Squadron air gunner Thomas Albert Bax. His other surviving No. 9 Squadron comrades were sent to other POW camps.\n\nIt has been argued that Bruce and Tunstall are the original innovators of the wooden horse escape technique.\nAlong with Eustace Newborn and Peter Tunstall, Bruce came up with the escape plan now known as \"the Swiss Red Cross Commission.\" Tunstall, also highlights that in 1941, prior to he and Bruce planning an escape with the famed 'Swiss Red Cross Commission,' he and Bruce had been digging an escape route with a wooden horse tunnel from inside the gymnasium, the wooden horse was placed roughly four feet from the wall that separated the gym from the moat. The digging was a very slow process, it required the removal of spoil, bricks and stone work, and was aided by other prisoners distracting the guards. They were later joined by Sammy Hoare and a syndicate who were promised a second go if they escaped undiscovered. Other members of this syndicate were also named as: Harry Bewlay, John Milner and Eustace Newborn.\n\nWhen Bruce and Tunstall noted the slow process they began examining the rest of the castle and left the digging to the other team involving Hoare. The tunnel almost reached completion but unfortunately the digging team got caught when a guard become suspicious at the large stones that were accumulating outside of the gym. The guard then called a search, and then found found the escape tunnel. When the guards found the shaft they called an Appell and Hauptmann Schmidt confidently stated to the prisoners, \"It is impossible to escape by tunnel or any other way.\" \n\nThis wooden horse gym escape tunnel was two years prior to the famed Sagan wooden horse escape. Tunstall stated that he would like to think some of the watchers and workers who helped on their original wooden horse escape may have mentioned it from time to time; and would like to think that their idea contributed to the success of the effort at Sagan.\n\nWhilst the wooden horse tunnel was being dug, Bruce and Tunstall, were planning, after they had escaped from the castle grounds, to steal an aircraft from Kassel airfield to fly to Basle Switzerland. To do this they also created Luftwaffe uniforms. As the tunnel was being dug by other prisoners, Bruce and Tunstall were also in the process of exploring the castle and keeping their options open for other escape possibilities in case the tunnel route was found. At this time, Bruce and Tunstall got to know a new prisoner called Eustace Newborn who was in the wooden horse tunnel syndicate. Newborn was a South African airman with plenty of experience flying Junkers Ju 52 and Junkers Ju 86 airplanes. Needing his experience with Junkers Ju 52 airplanes, Newborn joined their escape team. In the escape it was decided Tunstall, who could speak better German, would be a Feldwebel and Bruce and Newborn would be privates.\n\nBruce, Newborn and Tunstall also wanted to explore a walled off flat. The flat had once been explored by a French lieutenant named Merlin, who had broke into the flat in 1939. It was rumoured the previous occupant of this apartment was a forestry school principal who was now at the front for Germany. They eventually found a way into this flat via a chamber found at the top of the staircase which had a plaster ceiling. This chamber led to the attic. They broke through this plaster ceiling in the chamber with a four foot long metal-pole that they claimed could break through anything and that they affectionately pun-named Napoleon. From the attic they found a staircase down to the principals flat. Bruce and Tunstall picked the locked door at the bottom of the stairs. Inside the room they found escape material such as civilian clothes, officer uniforms, guns including a Luger pistol, maps, a compass, cases and stale cigars. Upon sourcing these materials Bruce and Tunstall then gave up their wooden horse tunnel escape completely and left it all to Hoare. Instead they began solely focussing on the bridge and gate security. Unfortunately the gate security had been increased because of a 1940 escape from the castle by three Canadians, Keith Milne, Don Middleton and Hank Wardle.\n\nThere were three companies working the castle gate. Tunstall called them, \"A company,\" \"B company\" and \"C company.\" Each company worked shifts. All staff rotated their roles and sometimes a staff member would be the sentry on the castle side of the bridge who opened the gate. There could be ten other posts a guard could be on.\n\nThe guard commander was on the other side of the bridge away from the castle. The sentry on the castle side of the bridge was to open and close the gate on command. To let people into the castle the sentry could only open the gate after an order that could only come from the guard commander, and this order would come after the guard commander had signed the people in. To let people out of the castle, the sentry, would blow a whistle, and the guard commander would come through the gate to sign the people out, then following a command, the sentry would then open the gate. Over time, they observed the C company Feldwebel was the least meticulous of the three companies and that there was no chance of escape if A company and B company had a shift, being they followed the protocol to the letter.\n\nThey worked out that C company had two big flaws that could be exploited. They noticed the guard commander did not bother with the protocol when the orderlies went to the moat to feed the pigs potato peelings and rubbish from the kitchen, this left the gate open. They also pinpointed the weak link in the C company team. Tunstall called the guard \"Blockhead.\" They believed he would be the least alert enough of the guards to notice their faces when they were in disguise.\n\nThey hid all the gear needed for the escape in the sick bay. They decided the escape would revolve around the three being disguised as a visiting Swiss Red Cross Commission inspection team. It was planned that on the day of escape, Tunstall would be dressed as an army Hauptmann and carrying the ID card which was no more than a touched up fishing license with an official seal, and Bruce and Newborn would be dressed as visiting doctors. Bruce and Newborn would be very well dressed, carrying dispatch cases. Bruce would also be wearing a Homburg hat and smoking a cigar. Newborn would be wearing a Tyrolean hat. Underneath the attire they would be each wearing their Luftwaffe uniforms. They also had a debate about carrying the Luger pistol. Bruce and Tunstall were in favour of carrying the gun for the sake of authenticity. Newborn, along with a prisoner called Joe Kayll were strongly against it, arguing you cannot expect the protection of the Geneva convention for carrying it. The argument was in turn settled by the SBO, Brigadier Somerset who strictly forbade them taking the Lugar with them. Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall then settled on building a replica using wood and lead stripped from the roof. They polished and blued the replica until it looked perfect. The escape was planned to be \"shit or bust\", as such the cases only carried three rations. More important to the three was boot polish, shaving equipment which would keep them presentable as Luftwaffe airmen, and the local map and compass. \n\nBruce and Tunstall estimated their escape from the castle grounds depended on these three things, pig feeding time leaving the gate to the bridge open, 'Blockhead' being on the gate and C company being on the afternoon shift. They waited a long time for these conditions to occur, waiting all through August. These conditions in turn rested on Blockhead failing a gullibility test. The plan was for this test to be performed by a prisoner called John Milner who spoke good German. The planned test was to see if Blockhead would bluff. In German, Milner would ask Blockhead if the German officer and the two Swiss doctors had left the castle? If Blockhead bluffed this question, he failed the test and this would probably mean he assumed a Swiss Commission team was inside the castle. If he bluffed Milner would give a thumbs up from behind his back and this thumbs up would mean the escape plan would kick into action. If ‘Blockhead,’ passed the test Milner would give a thumbs down signal from behind his back and the escape would not go ahead.\n\nUpon the thumbs up sign the kitchen orderlies would immediately go to the door with their kitchen rubbish. It was always predicted Blockhead and C company would always open the gate to the orderlies to allow the orderlies to feed the pigs with rubbish from the kitchen. At this point, when the gate was predicted to be left open by Blockhead, they devised to immerse Blockhead in to a social orchestration. They arranged for: Blockhead to be blustered and overwhelmed by his perceptions; they scheduled deftly timed goon baiting from the orderlies at the gate to overwhelm him; and timed for a perception of urgency from Swiss Commission inspection team and the Army Hauptmann, to rush him. \nPrior to walking through the gate the faux Swiss commission team would be seen having chats with the British medical officers to help with the frame. Upon reaching the gate they had lined up for Tunstall to state in German to Bruce, right in front of Blockhead, \"“Du lieber Gott, Herr Doktor, schon viertel zwei. Kommen, wir müssen weitergehen!”\" (“Good God, Doctor, it’s already a quarter to two. We must hurry!”).\n\nUpon exiting the castle security they planned on heading down the hill. At the bottom of the hill they planned on removing and hiding their Swiss commission clothes. They arranged to walk to the forest on their way to Kassel, dressed as Luftwaffe airmen, knowing the guards would eventually be searching for two civilians and an army Hauptmann. They also organised for a white smoke signal. The white signal would come from the kitchen. This white smoke would warn Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn that the guards are now searching for them.\n\nThe 'Swiss Red Cross Commission' has been described as the most audacious escape of World War II. Bruce's MC citation described it as a \"very clever escape.\" On the 3 September 1941 using an officer uniform and civilian clothes found in a walled off apartment belonging to the forestry principal, the three POWs simply walked out of the camp posing as a German officer (Tunstall) and two doctors (Bruce and Newborn) of a Swiss Red Cross inspection team.\n\nThe escape plan to escape the castle grounds worked. Milner tested the guard Blockhead and Milner gave the thumbs up. Bruce, disguised as a doctor, conversed with the British medical officers to help frame Blockheads confusion, the orderlies goon baited Blockhead at the gate, the Hauptmann (Tunstall) then marched to the gate in a hurry and stated to Bruce, \"“Du lieber Gott, Herr Doktor, schon viertel zwei. Kommen, wir müssen weitergehen!”\" Blockhead even saluted the Hauptmann (Tunstall). Tunstall walked by and walked through the gate, and Bruce and Newborn, carrying dispatch cases, with Bruce insouciantly smoking a cigar (a rarity by this period of the war; and convincing evidence for the guards that the visitor was Swiss), followed him over the bridge. The guards at the other end of the bridge saluted at the Hauptmann as they made it over the bridge on their way out of the castle grounds. Though Kassel is a right turn from the exit of the castle, exiting the grounds they turned left before they set on their way to Kassel and made their way to the bottom of the hill, were they removed and hid their commission disguises. They then, chose one of two roads that led from the castle, and marched to Kassel, along Melsunger Straße, dressed as Luftwaffe airmen.\n\nIn their escape plan there was only one thing that did not come off, at the bottom of the hill they did not see the white smoke warning that come from the kitchen warning them the security team was searching for them. There were also some close calls on the way to the forest. When on an open road heading towards the forest, search parties drove past them, even asking Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn if they had seen three escapees dressed as the Swiss Commission inspection team, causing some mild anxiety. Along the route, after walking openly through the streets saluting with German officers, they gained confidence their disguises were working.\n\nThey reached the airfield the next day. At Kassel airfield they intended to steal a Junkers Ju 52, which Newborn had flown before the war, and then fly to Basle Switzerland.They penetrated the aerodrome, but were discovered trying to start a Luftwaffe aircraft, so they decided to find another aerodrome that was less heavily guarded near the Belgian frontier. Whilst on the road from Kassel, unknown to Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall, every police and military unit in German occupied Europe had been informed of the escape of an army Hauptmann and two civilians from Spangenberg castle. They also decided it was better to travel in plain sight and in daylight with their Luftwaffe uniforms, whilst saluting and using colloquial phrases, instead of going cross country, and getting their uniforms dirty. As the escape was originally planned as \"shit or bust\" and they had packed limited rations, they decided they had to live of the land where possible, aiming to eat apples, plums and pears stolen from trees and by eating crops out of the soil. They also stole three loafs of bread from a horse and cart. To the laughter of Bruce and Newborn, Tunstall, stole three loafs of bread from a horse and cart whilst matching the horses gallop, and painfully crouching to stay out of the sight-line of the driver. \nOn the march Tunstall explained the three were approached by some women. As they could not hold a conversation in German this raised anxiety they could immediately be caught. Tunstall explained to the women that they must not speak to them. The women asked ‘warum’ (why). Tunstall mentioned “they are under arrest.” Bruce caught on quickly, and Tunstall claims Bruce then leered at them and did the ”finest brutal-and-licentious-soldiery act you can imagine.” In the IWM tapes Bruce expands on this. He relates how one morning (after a night sheltering under cover on farmland) they woke up to an audience of German land girls. They questioned Tunstall as to why the trio were travelling in such an unorthodox fashion. Tunstall, in an effort to allay their suspicions, claimed that he and Newborn were taking their prisoner Bruce to a military prison. The women asked what crimes Bruce had committed. As a prank, Bruce leered at the girls and replied 'unmentionable sexual practices' -upon which they ran away in alarm.\nAfter ten days on the road, near a small prison camp used for farm labour, they were arrested by a soldier who followed them on a bike with another guard and a civilian. This soldier, who just three weeks previously worked as a guard at Spangenberg, recognised Tunstall.\n\nBruce, Tunstall and Newborn were taken many miles to Frankenberg on the river Eder and interrogated by the Gestapo. During WWII, the Gestapo were notorious for not verifying information and sending people to concentration camps. Not much was known about the Gestapo in 1941. Tunstall described how even the Wehrmacht, who had transported them, become anxious in the malevolent presence of the Gestapo. Tunstall wanted to get out of the presence of the softly spoken Gestapo interrogator as soon as possible. When Tunstall was answering his questions, Bruce and Newborn looked at Tunstall with disdain, consequentially, when Bruce and Newborn were interrogated, they instead, approached the questioning from the interrogator with disrespect. Tunstall believes had the same situation happened just three years later, Bruce's and Newborn's approach could have been fatal.\n\nThey were then sent back to Spangenberg. Hauptmann Schmidt was incensed at the audacity of the escape. The three were each held to a long period in solitary confinement. Bruce received 53 days in solitude for the Spangenberg Castle escape, which was longer than the Geneva convention suggested. In Spangenberg they were not sentenced for their escape but held in \"preventative arrest.\" The Senior British Officer also complained that according to the Geneva convention guidelines, the exercise yard in Spangenberg was too small, and they needed to be moved to another camp.\n\nIn solitary confinement, Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall were placed in three separate cells in front of, and high above, the moat they had previously escaped from. The approach by C company to Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall was different to A and B company. When compared to C company, A and B company treat Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall with good humour. To the amusement of Bruce, Newborn, and Tunstall, in the remaining cell, Blockhead was also doing his time in confinement for letting the fake inspection team through the gate. Whilst they were held in confinement, they even managed to defy solitude after Bruce picked the lock on his, Newborn's and Tunstall's cell doors in order that they might join him in his cell to play poker with a set of home made cards a previous occupant had left behind. For the breaking of the solitude, Bruce was eventually court-martialled on the serious military charge of breaking free from arrest, the other two eventually got 5 extra days solitude. Tunstall explained he thought Bruce eventually got away with it by Bruce explaining escaping was not a court-martial offence for a POW, according to the Geneva Convention. Inside of solitary, Tunstall claims, early on, there were rumours of Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn being shot. After nearly eight weeks, the whole camp was made to move; Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn were rumoured to be, and expected to be, sent straight to the Colditz \"Straflager\" (punishment camp), instead, they were sent to Warburg. This immediate move was a hindrance to Bruce and Tunstall as they had been formulating two more escape plans. Tunstall mentions that on the journey to Warburg there was a flurry of train jumpers.\n\nAfter his Spangenberg Castle escape, Bruce was eventually sent to Oflag VI-B, then in the village of Dössel (now in Warburg). The Warburg camp has been described as soulless, bleak and unfinished. It roughly housed 3000 prisoners.\n\nUpon arrival Bruce and Tunstall immediately \"cased the joint\" and formulated escape plans. They noticed the secondary gate was used occasionally to march out guarded working parties of orderlies and that the security here was lax, when compared to Spangenberg. Bruce and Tunstall then created their first plan. The plan involved walking out of the camp dressed as guards. Bruce and Tunstall, then registered their new plan of escape with the Warburg escape committee. They then got working on German army uniforms to walk out through the lax security. They soon faced two problems. The first problem being being they were immediately put back into solitary; and the next problem being, the escape committee changed their plans.\n\nTheir previous \"preventative arrest\" in Spangenberg amounted to almost two months, and despite the fact they had been promised that their arrest time in Spangenberg would count against any sentence in Warburg, a Major called Rademacher announced to Bruce, Tunstall and Newborn that they each would be serving 28 days in solitary. This was the first immediate blow to Bruce's and Tunstall's first escape plan. The second blow occurred when the escape committee decided on adjusting their plan; they wanted their escape plan to accommodate more prisoners. The escape committee new plan was to use the uniforms and the forged papers and then march out a big bogus working party. Bruce and Tunstall were to be orderlies in the plan and the uniforms were to be worn by two fluent German speakers. One of the guards was called Peter Stevens MC who was a fluent German speaker; and the other guard of the orderlies was called Lance Pope who also spoke good German. Tunstall explains he and Bruce, accepted the change selflessly but were worried that the change in plan was too ambitious and would complicate things. Still the escape committee worked on the uniforms, dummy rifles and the forged documents which were forged by John Mansel. Mansel who Tunstall described as the master forger of WWII.\n\nThe first two times the worker party escape was tried it was held back at the gates via faults in the documentation. In January 1942, the third time they attempted the bogus worker party, they forged the signature of the guard Feldwebel Braun. This opened the gate. Though this escape was immediately hindered by the guardsman noticing Feldwebel Braun could not have signed the papers as he was on compassionate leave. The guards then started firing, and the bogus workers party dispersed. According to Tunstall, not one of the escape party was caught and the German uniforms, the dummy rifles and forged papers where quickly stowed away in the hides at emergency speed. The German search party, though, did find a piece of green cloth which was used to make the German uniform, on the camps belongings. Bruce and Tunstall were blamed for this by Major Rademacher. For this action Bruce received more time in solitary confinement.\n\nBruce and Tunstall were sent to solitary confinement for the attempted escape with a workers party and they were given three months. They felt persecuted by Rademacher as they perceived the Major was always putting them into confinement for baseless reasons. Whilst in solitary though they still constructed more escape plans. In this specific stretch of confinement, they worked out one more plan, and this set up involved an actual escape from inside the solitary confinement. They wanted to break out of the camp and follow a previous route to France which was attempted by a former prisoner who had jumped on a goods train in Dössel and had evaded capture for five days. They also noted the cell block was made of a heavy timber, and that to escape from the camp with this type of timber it required adequate tools. Knowing this escape needed tools, they then made a selection of hand made tools and wrapped them up. Bruce eventually hid the tools in the wood shavings in his mattress.\n\nKnowing the tools were now safe and they could pick their moment, on the morning of their planned escape, they noticed more snow had fell. They observed that this was not escaping weather and because of the conditions they had no option but to wait. This wait, sadly for Bruce and Tunstall, prolonged. Whilst waiting for the weather conditions to improve, Bruce and Tunstall were ordered to pack their belongings... and they were then sent to Colditz.\nA year later, inside Colditz, former Warburg prisoner Douglas Bader, explained the escape tools they left inside Warburg had been successfully used by another prisoner.\n\nBruce arrived in Colditz Castle, known as officer prisoner-of-war camp Oflag IV-C, on 16 March 1942. Colditz was near Leipzig in the State of Saxony. It was intended to contain Allied officers who had escaped many times from other prisoner-of-war camps and were deemed \"incorrigible\". It was the only POW camp with more guards than prisoners. The Nazis regarded it as the most escape proof prison in Germany. Colditz, because of the escapee prisoners it housed, eventually become thought of as an \"international escape academy.\" Heavily guarded Colditz, still managed more home runs than anywhere else.\n\n On the train journey to Colditz, they had been escorted to Colditz by three privates and one NCO. These guards were in turn briefed about Bruce's and Tunstall's propensity for escaping; the guards were under a threat of severe retribution if they ever escaped. The guards called Colditz \"Sonderlager\" (Special Camp) and the prisoners called Colditz \"Straflager\" (Punishmant Camp). When Bruce arrived at Colditz late at night and, for the first time, entered the deserted, flood lit exercise yard, on his way to the \"upper cells\", Tunstall recollects that Bruce's first words were, \"We'll get out of this bloody place too.\" To which Tunstall recalls he replied, \"You bet.\"\n\nAfter recapture from his Spangenberg and Warburg escapes, Bruce, now in Colditz, was put in a cell whilst waiting for trial. He was charged with breaking and entering for picking a lock in a walled off part of the Spangenberg Castle; and theft of the uniform he found in the walled off room inside Spangenberg Castle; the documents also show, he was put into solitary confinement in Spangenberg Castle, and allege, Bruce kicked the cell door down whilst in his cell. The alleged action of kicking the cell door down, added a very serious charge of sabotage of state property. Tunstall description of the events, differs to Bruce's charge sheet, it highlighted that no state property was broken and Bruce, Newborn and Tunstall were defying solitude after Bruce picked the locks in their solitary confinement. In WWII it was generally accepted that the main rules of escaping were: don't wear German uniform; don’t use violence; and don’t engage in espionage or sabotage. It was perceived that breaking these rules could result in the prisoner facing a court-martial, and even death. Bruce was clearly in trouble with regards to his charge sheet in that he had stolen a German uniform, and had been charged with an alleged sabotage of state property. The sabotage of state property being a very serious charge.\n\nTo defend himself, Bruce choose a fellow Colditz prisoner, Lieutenant Alan Campbell, a trained lawyer, to advocate for him. Campbell (subsequently Baron Campbell of Alloway ERD QC (24 May 1917 – 30 June 2013)) argued that, according to King's Regulations, Bruce had a duty to escape; and using a precedent, cited a case of a German fighter pilot called Franz von Werra who had escaped, von Werra who was famed for getting the German High Command to change its policy with regards to POW's; and highlighted the fact that Bruce had never used violence. After the trial, Bruce received a moderate sentence of three months in solitary.\n\nOn 21 April 1942 Bruce's commission was confirmed and he was promoted to the war substantive rank of flying officer.\n\nWithin six months Bruce escaped the castle grounds with the tea chest escape.\n\n Bruce was the author of the famed \"Tea Chest Escape\" which was featured in the Imperial War Museum's 'Great Escapes' exhibition in 2004, where the museum built a facsimile of the tea chest and invited children to see if they could 'escape from Colditz'. He made use of a \"silk map.\" The silk escaping map Bruce used in the escape to guide him to Danzig (now Gdansk) which was sent to him by his wife concealed in a brass button of a uniform, at the behest of MI9, can be seen in the IX Squadron archive museum at RAF Marham, donated to the Squadron in a handover ceremony by the Bruce family. Because of his very small stature Bruce was known ironically as the \"medium-sized man\" (see camaraderie with messmates section for the origin). When a new Commandant arrived at Colditz in the summer of 1942 he enforced rules restricting prisoners' personal belongings. On 8 September 1942 POWs were told to pack up all their excess belongings and an assortment of boxes were delivered to carry them into store. Bruce immediately seized his chance and was packed inside a Red Cross packing case, three foot square, with just a file and a length of rope made from bed sheets. Bruce was taken to a storeroom on the third floor of the German \"Kommandantur\" and that night made his escape. The next morning the castle was visited by General Wolff, officer in charge of POW army district 4. He inspected the camp and found everything to his satisfaction. Fortunately for the camp commandant, as Wolff was driven away, his back was turned to the southern face of the castle. If he had turned his head he would have seen a length of blue and white checked (bedsack) rope dangling from a remote window. It was, however, eventually noticed by a hausfrau (housewife) in the town, who quickly reported it to the duty officer. When the German guards entered the storeroom they found the empty box on which Bruce had, in yet another of his pranks, inscribed in chalk: \n\n He is thought to be the inventor of the 'triple identity' ploy for use when captured, which he explains in the Imperial War Museum Sound Archive tapes. The triple identity meant that he had three personae; his real identity as himself, the identity shown on his false ID papers; and another identity that he would only reveal under pressure. When he was captured, he was disguised as a Belgian Gastarbeiter or 'guest worker' named Josef Savon (his false ID is still in the possession of the Bruce family) another example of Bruce's fondness of disguises. In his autobiographical book, 'The Tunnellers of Sandborstal' (Robert Hale, 1959), Lieutenant Commander John 'Bosun' Chrisp MBE RN said that \"Bruce's adventures in various corners of occupied Europe read like John Buchan (author of 'The Thirty Nine steps') at his most melodramatic\" and that Bruce \"can claim to be the most ingenious and unlucky escaper of the war.\" The use of the Josef Savon disguise is also another example of Bruce's predilection for pranks, as Josef Savon translates into 'Joe Soap'. In 1944, Joe Soap was RAF slang for a legendary airman who \"carried the can\".\n\nWhen captured he pretended to break down and admitted he was in fact Flight Sergeant Joseph Lagan. Lagan was his brother in law and so Bruce could answer detailed questions about his service record etc. Initially the delighted Germans believed him and were ready to send him to a Stalag or 'other ranks' camp. Under the Geneva Convention, other ranks (unlike officers) could be made to work; and were often taken outside camps on working parties; from which it was easy to escape. His story when captured was that he had jumped from a British plane over Bremen and arrived in Danzig on a stolen bicycle; his bicycle, unbeknown to Bruce, had a local number on it. Bruce was then sent to the RAF camp at Dulag Luft near Oberursel. Whilst at the camp, the Germans had already requested a specialist Gestapo interrogator to come from Berlin, who was to recognise Bruce. When he arrived he took one look at the supposed Flight Sergeant Lagan and said \"Ah, Captain Bruce, how nice to see you again\". This was the second time he had interrogated Bruce (whom the Germans habitually addressed as 'Captain'). Under heavy guard, Bruce was taken by train back to Colditz. On the overheated train, the guard detail fell asleep and Bruce tried to escape once again, but was prevented by a watchful officer.\n\n The 'Tea Chest Escape' made Bruce the first prisoner to escape from both Spangenberg Castle and Colditz Castle. He was soon to be joined by Howard 'Hank' Wardle MC who would soon escape from Colditz with Captain Pat Reid, Major Ronald B. Littledale, and Lieutenant Commander L. W. Stephens. Wardle had also escaped from Spangenberg Castle. This escape by Wardle, Reid, Littledale and Stephens was aided by reconnaissance from Bruce. Pat Reid explained that whilst Bruce was in solitude, he got a message smuggled to Bruce, via his food. Reid wanted Bruce to give him some detail about the \"German Kommandantur\" of the castle. In due course Reid received a return message from Bruce. This message gave him information about the specific unused staircase, the top floors, and importantly, how the door to this staircase was in full view of the Kommandantur sentries, and how this door was put into shadow by the flood lights. On 14 October 1942, in the Kommandantur cellar escape, they all used Bruce's information and tried to get the staircase door open with a dummy key. Unfortunately the dummy key failed. This worked out though; as with their contingency plan, using the shadow, they slowly worked their way to the \"Kommandantur cellar\" to which they were to escape from.\n\nIn October 1942 seven captured commandos were processed inside Colditz and sent to solitary confinement. These commandos had previously been involved in the \"Operation Musketoon\" raid. Inside the cells Peter Storie-Pugh, Dick Howe and Bruce had managed to have conversations with them.\n\nOn 13 October 1942 the commandos were removed from Colditz and taken to the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RHSA) headquarters in Berlin, where they were interrogated one by one by Obergruppenführer Heinrich Müller. They remained in Berlin until 22 October, when they were taken to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. On the next day, 23 October, they were all shot in the back of the neck and their bodies cremated. These commandos were the first to fall victim to Adolf Hitler's \"Kommandobefehl\" (Commando Order) issued on 18 October 1942, which called for the execution of all commandos after capture.\n\nIn 1964 Stephen Schofield interviewed Bruce for his book 'Musketoon: commando raid, Glomfjord, 1942' (University of Michigan), revealing that while in the solitary confinement cells, Bruce managed to make contact with Captain Black DSO, leader of Operation Musketoon, the Anglo-Norwegian commando raid mounted against the German-held Glomfjord power plant in Norway. Bruce was the last British person to speak to Black before he (and six comrades) was murdered in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. The official German story given to the Red Cross was that the seven men had escaped and not been recaptured, and Colditz \"Oflag IVC\" were instructed to return any letters to their senders marked \"Geflohen\" (escaped), but Bruce's testimony was sent from Colditz to MI5 in London and ensured that the British authorities knew the truth.\n\nBruce was promoted again, to flight lieutenant, on 20 January 1943.\n\nBy 1944 escaping was becoming tougher and more risky. Walter Morison explained that by August 1943 most of the loopholes to escape in the castle had been exploited; making escaping even harder. By spring 1944 escaping got more risky. Contrary to the Geneva convention the use of force had been debated inside the German mess for years. Oberstleutnant Prawitt, the Kommandant and Staff Paymaster Heinze were keen on using it on repeat offenders, such as Bruce. As was the Major Amthor, the new second in command, who had joined the mess in May 1943. Amthor was a young keen Nazi and had constantly tried to influence for the use rough measures. Amthor and Prawit were hated by the prisoners that when ever they entered the court yard they were whistled and howled at. Püpke was not a Nazi and was even given a courteous reception during Appell in the summer of 1944. In late March 1944, Hitler had disregarded the Geneva Convention with regards to POW's. The punishment for escape now carried a punitive risk of execution. Bruce made two further escape attempts in 1944; on 19 April and on the 16 June.\n\nOn his 19 April escape he cut through bars on north side of the castle and reached the wire fence before being detected. After Bruce was seen by the sentries, Bruce was then fired at by rifle and machine guns. Knowing he did not stand a chance, Bruce surrendered. When surrendering, Bruce, to the amusement of the German guards, instead of yelling, \"Ich gebe auf\" (\"I give up\"), in a \"faux pas\" yelled, \"Ich ueber gebe mich\" (\"I feel sick.\").\n\nOn 16 June escape, Bruce, Major R. Lorraine and John \"Bosun\" Chrisp tunnelled through sewers into an old well in the German yard that had a pipe that lead into the river, but were again detected. The sewage escape route that lead to the manhole covered well, was found via the help of earlier tunnelling and reconnaissance by the Poles, along with the help of Jack Best (also of the Colditz Cock fame) and Mike Harvey. Best and Harvey had frequented with the Poles in their time as \"ghost prisoners\" and had participated in their tunnel digging. Best hated the tunnel in his days as a ghost prisoner, claiming your arse always got wet with cold waste water. Though Best noted the Poles were very proud of their dangerous tunnel. One prisoner claimed the tunnel even had a 'terrifying' electrical cable that ran inside the damp conditions. When the Poles left the castle, the tunnel was bought by a party involving Douglas Bader, for 100 cigarettes. Sometime after 1941, the Poles had dug a key hole through a rock that itself led onto the main sewer system. In 1944, Bruce, Chrisp and Lorraine, surveyed the tunnel, whilst Dick Howe ensured the kitchen, showers and toilets were off limits to other POW's. When they entered that hole they found the main sewage system led to the well; the well they were soon to be captured in. They then returned to base, to have the castle's doctor brush them with iodine, and to collect some tools which would help them hammer spikes into the well wall.\n\nWhen they returned to the well, Lorraine, tied by a rope, was lowered to the bottom of the well, in what was low tide, and began hammering in the spikes. There were three manhole covers around the German Kommandantur that were within 50 yards of each other. At the archway halfway outside of the castle, a guard heard noises beneath his feet, whilst he was standing near one of the manhole covers. Upon hearing the noise, the guard gave a shout to the riot squad and security officer; and an immediate order was made to open up the three manhole covers. Staff Paymaster Heinze walked past one of the covers and spotted them and spat at them calling them \"”stinking swines.”\" Later, for this abuse, the Senior British Officer (SBO), obtained an apology. A guard also threatened to shoot Bruce, Lorraine and Chrisp whilst they were in the uncovered drain. The Germans then called an immediate \"Sonderappell.\" and after this Appell, an effort was made by the escape committee to save the hundred yard tunnel from inside the ex-Polish long-room, unluckily, for the escape committee, the Appell had given the Germans enough time to uncover the rest of the shaft.\n\nWhen Bruce, Lorraine and Chrisp were caught, according to Chrisp, Bruce became spokesman for the three in the interrogation. As spokesman he declined to answer to Eggers, on three separate times, as to where the entrance to their escape tunnel was. For this the three men where placed in front of a wall and faced a firing squad; though Eggers did not give an order to fire. Chrisp explained, in his IWM tapes, the three were then put in the civilian cells outside the castle for two or three weeks; whereby after the solitary confinement, the Senior British Officer informed them that the Komandment had fined them £100 each for damaging the drains. Bruce, upon hearing the fine, made a counter claim, and he billed the Kommandant for £200 each for their service of cleaning the drains that had not been cleaned for 300 years. With regards to billing the Kommandant, Chrisp explained it wasn’t just Bruce behaving like this; and that in the castle, this type of behaviour went on all the time - it never stopped.\n\nThe Germans were getting tired of the prisoner escapes, and in the summer of 1944, each POW camp was given a flyer reinforcing the fact the Germans were taking escaping very seriously. The notice referenced that breaking out was no longer a sport, and that prisoners would be shot if the attempted to escape. The notice was up inside the Colditz prisoner yard by the 8 August 1944. Eventually, orders came (via MI9 and the Senior British Officer) that all escapes were forbidden and so Bruce and his comrades had to sit out the war until the liberation came in April 1945.\n\n Bruce was eventually liberated on 16 April 1945 by the US Army. In a 1973 interview, Bruce described the day of liberation as, pure wild west, getting guns, going off to liberate chickens and wine, and having a great time.\n\nIn the IWM tapes Bruce describes the scene. The first GI through the castle gates heard a voice from a second floor window. \"Take that man's sidearm\" the voice ordered. The GI duly disarmed a German guard. \"Tie it onto this piece of string\" the voice said. The GI complied. The pistol (which is still in the possession of the Bruce family) was hauled up the castle wall and disappeared into the window. Bruce (who, like the other prisoners and Germans alike, had been at near starvation levels during the last months of the war) went directly to the castle kitchens and put the gun to the head of a German cook and demanded a chicken. Sadly, there were none to be had. Bruce was flown to England to meet the two small boys (and the wife) he had not seen since 1941 outside Victoria railway station in London.\n\nIn October 1946 he was awarded the Military Cross (MC) for his escape attempts, making him the only person ever to be awarded both the Military Cross and the Air Force Medal.\n\n\nAfter the war, Bruce and his wife Mary, bought Blakesley Lodge in Green Street, Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey. They brought up nine children, six boys and three girls.\nOne of his sons, Brendan, is a communications executive, and a former Director of Communications to Prime Minister Thatcher. The Bruce family report that his nickname amongst the family (which was given to him by his Italian son-in-law, Piero Carloni), was 'Il Cavaliere' ('the knight') due to his Papal knighthood .\n\n In 1946 Bruce became a student at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, reading Modern History, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. He completed what was known as War Degree (7 terms) and was awarded a Master of Arts degree in 1953.\n\nBruce served as an Adult Education Tutor at Bristol University, 1949–50. He was Assistant Secretary of the University Committee, Adult Education HM Forces, 1950–53; Further Education Officer, Surrey County Council, 1953–59; Principal, Richmond Technical Institute, 1959–62. Bruce became the Founding Principal of Kingston College of Further Education, 1962–1980.\nThere was significant interest at the time for this important new position and the short list consisted of Bruce, a distinguished Royal Navy Captain and an Army Brigadier (i.e. a 'one star' general). Bruce's quick wit was responsible for his appointment. When he entered the interview room, the Chairman of the Panel was reading his CV and looked up at him in astonishment saying \"it says here that you have nine children. Are they all yours?\" (thinking that some were perhaps stepchildren). \"So my wife assures me\" came Bruce's imperturbable reply.\n\nIn civic and charitable bodies Bruce also acted as:\n\nBruce was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in 1989 for his services to Education. He was also awarded the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great (Latin: \"Ordo Sancti Gregorii Magni\") by Pope John Paul II.\n\n \n\n Dominic Bruce died on 12 February 2000 in Richmond, Surrey, England. He was survived by Mary Brigid Bruce (died 15 June 2000) and his six sons and three daughters.\n\nIn 2015 his medal group (unique in that he is the only person in British military history to be awarded both the Military Cross and the Air Force Medal) was donated by his family to the Ashcroft Trust for the benefit of the RAF Benevolent Fund and the British Red Cross, the latter having kept him alive in Colditz by the sending of regular food parcels.\n\nIn the BBC TV series \"Colditz\" (1972–74), which chronicled the lives of the Allied prisoners of war held in the castle, one of the characters portrayed was Flight Lieutenant Simon Carter (played by David McCallum) - Carter was a young, upstart, hot-headed RAF officer who enjoys goon-baiting and is very impatient to escape. The fictional Carter closely resembles Bruce. In the episode, from series one, 'Gone Away, part 1', first shown 18 January 1973, the 'Tea Chest Escape' was re-enacted.\n\n\"Colditz\", a 2005 British two-part television miniseries produced by Granada Television for ITV, written by Peter Morgan and directed by Stuart Orme, features a fictionalised account of an actual event when three inmates; Dick Lorraine, John 'Bosun' Chrisp, and the 'Medium Sized Man', Dominic Bruce attempted to escape using the castle sewers. In reality the escape team were discovered when they attempted to exit a manhole. The Germans threatened to throw grenades down into the sewer chamber and, as the escapers could not reverse back up the sewer pipe, they were forced to surrender. They were immediately put in front of a firing squad, but unlike the fictional TV account, the guards did not fire. Just before the order was to be given, Bruce lost his temper and approached the officer in charge, Eggers, saying \"you can shoot us, but after the War we'll hang you\". Eggers stood the squad down.\n\nThe 'Red Cross Commission' escape from Spangenberg provided the plot for the 1961 film, 'Very Important Person' although no acknowledgement was made by the producers at the time. In the film, James Robertson Justice also escapes disguised as a Swiss civilian Commissioner, just as Bruce had done in real life.\n\nOn the 70th Anniversary of the liberation of Colditz, the BBC programme 'The One Show' featured photographs of the 'Tea Chest' escape which were discussed by the participants.\n\nThe BBC series \"Colditz\" (1972–74), was such a success that it was quickly repeated. In order to make up the episodes to a sixty-minute slot (the BBC had hoped to sell the series to the USA, hence the use of Robert Wagner, so they had to be only fifty minutes in length to include commercials) a select group of six Colditz escapers were interviewed individually by the famous war correspondent Frank Gillard and shown immediately after the repeat programmes were broadcast. Bruce was one of the interviewees. The documentary series was called \"Six from Colditz,\" and Bruce's interview was listed in 17 April 1973, and also on 17 January 1974 in the Radio Times. Transcripts of Bruce's interview, with Gillard, which aired in 1973, exist.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2006 the Colditz Society created a selection of filmed interviews with many Colditz survivors. Bruce was recorded and is referenced in the collection. These interviews are now museum artefacts and are held in the Imperial War Museum.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Individuals who claim to experience this call themselves \"targeted individuals\" who are victims of gang stalking and many have joined support and advocacy groups.\n\nMultiple medical professionals have evaluated that these experiences are hallucinations; the result of delusional disorders or psychosis, the same sources from which arise religious delusions, accounts of alien abductions, and beliefs in visitations from dead relatives. It can be difficult to persuade people who experience them that their belief in an external influence is delusional.\n\nThe experiences of people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment using esoteric technology, and who call themselves \"Targeted Individuals\" (\"T.I.\") vary, but include hearing voices in their heads calling them by name, often mocking them or others around them, as well as physical sensations like burning. They have also described being under physical surveillance by one or more people. Many of these people act and function otherwise normally and included among them are people who are successful in their careers and lives otherwise, and who find these experiences confusing, upsetting, and sometimes shameful, but entirely real. They use news stories, military journals and declassified national security documents to support their allegations that governments have developed technology that can send voices into people's heads and cause them to feel things.\n\nPsychologist Lorraine Sheridan co-authored a study of gang-stalking in the \"Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology\". According to Sheridan, \"One has to think of the T.I. phenomenon in terms of people with paranoid symptoms who have hit upon the gang-stalking idea as an explanation of what is happening to them\". Mental health professionals say that TIs can experience hallucinations and their explanations of being targeted or harassed arise from delusional disorders or psychosis. Yale psychiatry professor Ralph Hoffman states that people often ascribe voices in their heads to external sources such as government harassment, God, and dead relatives, and it can be difficult to persuade them that their belief in an external influence is delusional. Other experts compare these stories to accounts of alien abductions.\n\nPress accounts have documented individuals who apparently believed they were victims of electronic harassment, and in some cases persuaded courts to agree. In 2008, James Walbert went to court claiming that his former business associate had threatened him with \"jolts of radiation\" after a disagreement, and later claimed feeling symptoms such as electric shock sensations, and hearing generated tones and other strange sounds in his ears. The court decided to issue an order banning \"electronic means\" to further harass Walbert.\n\nVarious people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have committed crimes; among those crimes are mass shootings.\n\nFuaed Abdo Ahmed, a 20-year-old man, took two women and a man hostage at the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank on August 13, 2013, eventually killing two of them and then himself. A subsequent police investigation officially concluded that Ahmed suffered from mental issues such as hearing voices and paranoid schizophrenia. Ahmed had accused the family of his ex-girlfriend of placing a \"microphone device\" of some kind in his head.\n\nOn September 16, 2013, Aaron Alexis fatally shot twelve people and injured three others in the Washington Navy Yard using a shotgun on which he had written \"my ELF weapon\", before being killed by responding police officers. The FBI federal law enforcement agency concluded that Alexis suffered from \"delusional beliefs\" that he was being \"controlled or influenced by extremely low frequency electromagnetic waves\".\n\nOn November 20, 2014, Myron May shot and injured three people on the campus of Florida State University and was killed by responding police officers. Before the event, he had become increasingly anxious that he was under government surveillance and heard voices.\n\nOn February 20, 2016, Jason Brian Dalton, an Uber driver, was accused in a deadly shooting spree in which six people were killed and two others were injured in Kalamazoo County, Michigan. He blamed his actions on his Uber mobile app, which uses a symbol that he claims resembles the Order of the Eastern Star, and claimed it took over his body after he pressed the button of a new app resembling the Devil.\n\nGavin Eugene Long, who killed three police officers and injured three others in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on July 17, 2016, believed in a number of anti-government movements and conspiracy theories, and was a member of a group dedicated to helping people suffering from \"remote brain experimentation, remote neural monitoring of an entire human's body.\"\n\nMind control conspiracy advocates believe they have found references to secret weapons in government programs such as \"Project Pandora\", a DARPA research effort into biological and behavioral effects of microwave radiation commissioned after the Moscow Signal incident, when the US embassy in Moscow was bombarded with microwaves by the Soviets beginning in 1953. It was discovered that the Soviets' intent was eavesdropping and electronic jamming rather than mind control. Project Pandora studied the effects of occupational radiation exposure, and the project's scientific review committee concluded that microwave radiation could not be used for mind control. Conspiracy advocates also frequently cite the 2002 Air Force Research Laboratory patent for using microwaves to send spoken words into someone's head. Although there is no evidence that mind control using microwaves exists, rumors of continued classified research fuel the worries of people who believe they are being targeted.\n\nIn 1987, a U.S. National Academy of Sciences report commissioned by the Army Research Institute noted psychotronics as one of the \"colorful examples\" of claims of psychic warfare that first surfaced in anecdotal descriptions, newspapers, and books during the 1980s. The report cited alleged psychotronic weapons such as a \"hyperspatial nuclear howitzer\" and beliefs that Russian psychotronic weapons were responsible for Legionnaire's disease and the sinking of the USS \"Thresher\" among claims that \"range from incredible to the outrageously incredible\". The committee observed that although reports and stories as well as imagined potential uses for such weapons by military decision makers exist, \"Nothing approaching scientific literature supports the claims of psychotronic weaponry\".\n\nPsychotronic weapons were reportedly being studied by the Russian Federation during the 1990s with military analyst Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas saying in 1998 that there was a strong belief in Russia that weapons for attacking the mind of a soldier were a possibility, although no working devices were reported. In Russia, a group called \"Victims of Psychotronic Experimentation\" attempted to recover damages from the Federal Security Service during the mid-1990s for alleged infringement of their civil liberties including \"beaming rays\" at them, putting chemicals in the water, and using magnets to alter their minds. These fears may have been inspired by revelations of secret research into \"psychotronic\" psychological warfare techniques during the early 1990s, with Vladimir Lopatkin, a State Duma committee member in 1995, surmising \"Something that was secret for so many years is the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy theories.\"\n\nIn 2012, Russian Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin commented on plans to draft proposals for the development of psychotronic weapons. NBC News Science Editor Alan Boyle dismissed notions that such weapons actually existed, saying, \"there's nothing in the comments from Putin and Serdyukov to suggest that the Russians are anywhere close to having psychotronic weapons.\"\n\nThere are extensive online support networks and numerous websites maintained by people fearing mind control. Palm Springs psychiatrist Alan Drucker has identified evidence of delusional disorders on many of these websites and psychologists agree that such sites negatively reinforce mental troubles, while some say that the sharing and acceptance of a common delusion could function as a form of group cognitive therapy.\n\nAccording to psychologist Sheridan, \"page after page\" of internet search results about electronic harassment \"that regard it as fact\" and the absence of counter-information creates a harmful \"closed ideology echo chamber\" for TIs.\n\nAs part of a 2006 British study by Vaughan Bell, independent psychiatrists determined \"signs of psychosis are strongly present\" based on evaluation of a sample of online mind-control accounts whose posters were \"very likely to be schizophrenic\". Psychologists have identified many examples of people reporting \"mind control experiences\" (MCEs) on self-published web pages that are \"highly likely to be influenced by delusional beliefs\". Common themes include \"bad guys\" using \"psychotronics\" and \"microwaves\", frequent mention of the CIA's MKULTRA project and frequent citing of a scientific paper entitled \"Human auditory system response to modulated electromagnetic energy\".\n\nSome people who describe themselves as undergoing electronic harassment have organized and campaigned to stop the use of alleged psychotronic and other mind control weapons. These campaigns have received some support from public figures, including former U.S. Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who included a provision banning \"psychotronic weapons\" in a 2001 bill that was later dropped, and former Missouri State Representative Jim Guest.\n\n\n"}

It took place in Jerusalem, Israel,\nfollowing Dana International's win at the 1998 contest in Birmingham, United Kingdom with the song \"Diva\". This was Israel's third victory in the contest (after 1978 and 1979), and the second time hosting the event (after 1979).\n\nIt was held on 29 May 1999 at the International Convention Center, the same venue that hosted it 20 years earlier. Television news anchor Yigal Ravid, singer and 1992 contestant Dafna Dekel and model/actress Sigal Shachmon were the show's hosts, and it was the first time that three presenters were used to host the Contest. Israel's two previous winners, Izhar Cohen, who won in 1978 with \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\" and Milk and Honey's Gali Atari who won it the next year with \"Hallelujah\" attended as spectators.\n\nThe winner of the Contest was Charlotte Nilsson, representing Sweden with \"Take Me to Your Heaven\", which scored 163 points. This was Sweden's fourth win in the Contest and the second in the 1990s (after Carola's win for Sweden in 1991).\n\nIn the run-up to the Contest, many speculated that it would not be held in Israel, but would be moved to either Malta or stay at the United Kingdom (the countries that completed the top 3 of the 1998 Contest). This came about after major concerns over funding for the event from the Israeli government arose, alongside the opposition from Orthodox Jews that they would attempt to stop the Contest from coming to Israel after Dana International won the previous year's Contest. This, however, provided no hindrance for IBA or to the organizing team of the event, and the Ussishkin Auditorium at International Convention Center in Jerusalem was selected as the venue for the 44th Contest. As of 2018, this is the last Eurovision Song Contest to have been held in a concert hall rather than in an indoor arena.\n\nLong-standing rules in place for decades were abolished during this Contest: rules that each country had to sing in one of their national languages was abolished for the first time since 1977. A majority of the participating countries, fourteen out of twenty-three, chose to sing entirely or partly in English and only eight entirely in their respective national languages; Lithuania, Spain, Croatia, Poland, France, Cyprus, Portugal and Turkey, not counting the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, whose national language is English. Furthermore, live music became optional for the first time in the Contest's history. IBA took advantage of this and decided to drop the orchestra from the Contest as a way to conserve money for the show. This meant that for the first time all entries used backing track during their performances. This caused controversy for Eurovision traditionalists, with three-time winner Johnny Logan criticising the move, describing the event now as \"karaoke\".\n\nA compilation CD was released in Israel. The CD omitted the songs from Poland, Cyprus, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Since then, all compilation CDs have featured all the songs.\n\nIt was announced in 1999 that, as of the 2000 Contest, the four biggest financial contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) – Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom – would all be given automatic entry into the Contest, regardless of their average scores over the past five years.\n\nLatvia had attempted to participate in the Contest for the first time, but withdrew at a late stage. This gave Hungary a chance to enter the Contest; however, Magyar Televízió decided not to take part. This allowed Portugal to compete as the 23rd country.\n\nAustria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark and Iceland returned to the Contest after being relegated from competing in 1998. Lithuania also returned to the Contest for the first time in five years. The Lithuanian delegation has had budget problems to contend with, and so the EBU allowed the Lithuanians to arrive in Israel a day later than everyone else. The first delegation on the other hand, to arrive were Estonia.\n\nAfter being relegated from the 1998 Contest, Russia's Channel One had decided not to broadcast that year's contest, in order to allow for a strong comeback in Israel. However, as only countries which had broadcast the previous year's contest were allowed to enter the next year's contest, Russia was forced to miss another year. They were joined by Finland, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia and Switzerland; the countries with the lowest average scores over the previous five years.\n\nThe favourites to win the Contest came from Iceland's Selma with \"All Out of Luck\", and Cyprus's Marlain with \"Tha 'Ne Erotas\", after an internet poll by fans. But, while Iceland finished second to Sweden (the country's best showing in the contest), Cyprus failed to inspire televotes, finishing second last with only two points, both from the United Kingdom.\n\nA number of controversies occurred before the Contest. Two songs selected to compete in Israel were found to be ineligible: Bosnia and Herzegovina's Hari Mata Hari were disqualified after their entry was discovered to have been released in Finland some years previously; Germany's Corinna May was also disqualified after her song was revealed to have been released in 1997 by a different singer. Both artists would eventually represent their countries in Eurovision, in 2006 and 2002 respectively.\n\nCroatia's entry attracted objections from the Norwegian delegation, due to synthesised male vocals being used on the backing track of Doris Dragović's entry. The EBU decided to reduce the country's score by a third for the purpose of calculating its five-year average to determine participation in future contests, though it was decided to leave its placement in the 1999 result unaffected.\n\nThe interval act was provided by Dana International, who performed a cover of the Stevie Wonder song \"Free\", which although was a smash hit in Israel at the time, caused some controversy there due to the song's lyrics. Dana International also appeared at the end of the show, handing the winning trophy to Nilsson. After pretending that the trophy was too heavy to lift, she fell to the stage, bringing down the winning composers with her. The show finished with the three presenters inviting everyone on stage to sing a rendition of the English version of \"Hallelujah\", the Israeli winner from the 1979 Contest, as a tribute to the victims of the Balkan War (particularly Serbia and Montenegro, which was banned from participation as penalty for the Balkan Wars), who were unable to view the contest after bombings destroyed television transmitters.\n\nEach country had a televote, where the top ten most voted-for songs were awarded the 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 points, with the exceptions of Turkey, Lithuania, Ireland and Bosnia & Herzegovina who used juries.\n\nBelow is a summary of all 12 point in the final:\n"}

Robert Dick, Arturo Yunge, Alfredo Daetz and Flora Inostroza made up the organizing committee for the first 12 years of the festival’s existence, and much of the credit for the success of the festival should be granted to them. Thanks to Flora Inostroza, the Universidad de Chile and the Chilean Air Force have been close collaborators in the festival since its launch.\n\nIn the early days, the Musical Weeks were held in Catholic or Lutheran church and then at the municipal gym, until they became so popular that they needed a larger venue.\n\nThe Musical Weeks have been held every summer since 1968. Today the festival is one of the most important classical music events in Chile.\n\nFrutillar is a small town and commune located in southern Chile in the Los Lagos Region, 983 km (630 mi) south of Santiago, the capital.\nThe bay of Frutillar is found on the shores of Lake Llanquihue, the largest lake lying entirely within Chile. Frutillar (which translates as “strawberry fields”) is known as the \"City of Music\" thanks to the festival, and was originally populated mainly by German settlers from Hamburg in the 1850s.\n\nThe main venue of the festival since 2010 is the Teatro del Lago (\"Theatre of the Lake\"), a theatre and concert hall housed in a 10,000 m2 building. Opening on November 6, 2010 after 12 years in development, it is located right on the shore of Llanquihue Lake so that the interior auditorium enjoys a view of the snow-capped Osorno Volcano across the lake.\n\nThe architecture of the building is contemporary, but retains links with the traditional southern Chilean style, strongly influenced by German immigrants. Native materials were used in construction, such as wood, stone and copper.\n\nThe largest room in the venue is the \"Espacio Tronador\", which can seat almost 1,200 spectators. The auditorium is made completely of wood, and the spaces are outlined by the curved lines of the stage, rows of seats and high balconies.\n\nThere is also a range of other multipurpose salons and foyers, exhibition areas, rehearsal spaces, conference rooms and congress halls.\n\nThe festival takes place between January and February every year and lasts for 10 days. It features more than 40 classical concerts performed by both Chilean and international artists. The program includes music and composers from different periods as well as famous Chilean and international performers and conductors, chamber orchestras, choirs and soloists.\n\nIn addition to the events that take place in Frutillar, other nearby towns also hold free concerts.\n\nSculptures on musical and festival themes can be found all along the Frutillar lakeshore, such as an amphitheatre, a Steinway grand piano and a gazebo, to name a few.\n\n\n"}

The novel describes the events and social circumstances that lead up to, and form the aftermath of, a fictional school shooting. The story is presented in the form of dickents of transcribed post-incident interviews with students, parents, teachers, and community members, compiled by Denise Shipley, a journalism student who is the stepsister of one of the shooters. The interviews provide a variety of viewpoints on the incident – some sympathetic, others hostile. Interspersed through the book are footnotes providing statistical information about guns and gun violence.\nThe plot has some similarities to the real-life Columbine High School massacre of April 20, 1999, although Strasser began research on the book before the Columbine shooting. The book was the first book relating to school shootings published after Columbine.\n\nBrendan Lawlor and Gary Searle are students at Middletown High School. Gary has lived in town since second grade, while Brendan is a new arrival. The two quickly become friends. They are subjected to verbal and physical bullying by football players at Middletown, which teachers and parents fail to notice, downplay, or outright ignore. \n\nAs time passes, both boys become darker and angrier, experimenting with alcohol and drugs, becoming obsessive about violent video games, and withdrawing from most social activities. Eventually the boys begin to obsess over the possibility of acting on their violent impulses. Gary experiments with developing a powerful homemade bomb. Gary and Brendan steal semi-automatic guns from a neighbour. Meanwhile, students are excited about an upcoming dance to be held in the school's gym. \n\nOn the night of the dance, Brendan leaves a cryptic message for his friend Emily, warning her not to attend because there will be trouble. Masked, Brendan and Gary enter the gym just after the dance begins. They shoot out the lights before restraining the attendees with cable ties. Gary booby-traps the doors with bombs so they will explode if anyone tries to open them. \n\nThe pair approach the football team's quarterback, Sam, who has been one of their main tormentors. After some debate, they decide to shoot out his kneecaps so he will be unable to play football ever again. Gary and Brendan fire their guns randomly around the gym, scaring students and injuring others. Another football player, Dustin, manages to get free and unties some others. Gary commits suicide while Brendan is beaten into a coma by the football players. Brendan suffers irreversible brain damage from the beating and those responsible are arrested and put on trial for attempted murder. \n\nThe book ends with Denise Shipley, Gary's stepsister, wondering if Gary knew if there were other options besides violence. She swears she will always treat others with respect and teach others to do the same. She also shares her belief that semi-automatic weapons should be outlawed and handguns should be only in the hands of law enforcement.\n\n"}

{"id": "781729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=781729", "title": "Independence Day (United States)", "text": "Independence Day (United States)\n\nIndependence Day (colloquial: the Fourth of July) is a federal holiday in the United States commemorating the adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. The Continental Congress declared that the thirteen American colonies regarded themselves as free and independent states, the United States of America, and were no longer connected to the British Crown. The Congress actually voted to declare independence two days earlier, on July 2.\n\nIndependence Day is commonly associated with fireworks, parades, barbecues, carnivals, fairs, picnics, concerts, baseball games, family reunions, and political speeches and ceremonies, in addition to various other public and private events celebrating the history, government, and traditions of the United States. Independence Day is the National Day of the United States.\n\nDuring the American Revolution, the legal separation of the Thirteen Colonies from Great Britain in 1776 actually occurred on July 2, when the Second Continental Congress voted to approve a resolution of independence that had been proposed in June by Richard Henry Lee of Virginia declaring the United States independent from Great Britain's rule. After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a Committee of Five, with Thomas Jefferson as its principal author. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4. A day earlier, John Adams had written to his wife Abigail:\n\nAdams's prediction was off by two days. From the outset, Americans celebrated independence on July 4, the date shown on the much-publicized Declaration of Independence, rather than on July 2, the date the resolution of independence was approved in a closed session of Congress.\n\nHistorians have long disputed whether members of Congress signed the Declaration of Independence on July 4, even though Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, and Benjamin Franklin all later wrote that they had signed it on that day. Most historians have concluded that the Declaration was signed nearly a month after its adoption, on August 2, 1776, and not on July 4 as is commonly believed.\n\nCoincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the Declaration of Independence later to serve as Presidents of the United States, died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Although not a signer of the Declaration of Independence, James Monroe, another Founding Father who was elected as President, also died on July 4, 1831. He was the third President who died on the anniversary of independence. Calvin Coolidge, the 30th President, was born on July 4, 1872; so far he is the only U.S. President to have been born on Independence Day.\n\n\n\nIndependence Day is a national holiday marked by patriotic displays. Similar to other summer-themed events, Independence Day celebrations often take place outdoors. According to , Independence Day is a federal holiday, so all non-essential federal institutions (such as the postal service and federal courts) are closed on that day. Many politicians make it a point on this day to appear at a public event to praise the nation's heritage, laws, history, society, and people.\n\nFamilies often celebrate Independence Day by hosting or attending a picnic or barbecue; many take advantage of the day off and, in some years, a long weekend to gather with relatives or friends. Decorations (\"e.g.\", streamers, balloons, and clothing) are generally colored red, white, and blue, the colors of the American flag. Parades are often held in the morning, before family get-togethers, while fireworks displays occur in the evening after dark at such places as parks, fairgrounds, or town squares.\n\nThe night before the Fourth was once the focal point of celebrations, marked by raucous gatherings often incorporating bonfires as their centerpiece. In New England, towns competed to build towering pyramids, assembled from barrels and casks. They were lit at nightfall to usher in the celebration. The highest were in Salem, Massachusetts, with pyramids composed of as many as forty tiers of barrels. These made the tallest bonfires ever recorded. The custom flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries and is still practiced in some New England towns.\n\nIndependence Day fireworks are often accompanied by patriotic songs such as the national anthem, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"; \"God Bless America\"; \"America the Beautiful\"; \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\"; \"This Land Is Your Land\"; \"Stars and Stripes Forever\"; and, regionally, \"Yankee Doodle\" in northeastern states and \"Dixie\" in southern states. Some of the lyrics recall images of the Revolutionary War or the War of 1812.\nFirework shows are held in many states, and many fireworks are sold for personal use or as an alternative to a public show. Safety concerns have led some states to ban fireworks or limit the sizes and types allowed. In addition, local and regional weather conditions may dictate whether the sale or use of fireworks in an area will be allowed. Some local or regional firework sales are limited or prohibited because of dry weather or other specific concerns. On these occasions the public may be prohibited from purchasing or discharging fireworks, but professional displays (such as those at sports events) may still take place, if certain safety precautions have been taken.\n\nA salute of one gun for each state in the United States, called a \"salute to the union,\" is fired on Independence Day at noon by any capable military base.\n\nNew York City has the largest fireworks display in the country, with more than 22 tons of pyrotechnics exploded in 2009. It generally holds displays in the East River. Other major displays are in Seattle on Lake Union; in San Diego over Mission Bay; in Boston on the Charles River; in Philadelphia over the Philadelphia Museum of Art; in San Francisco over the San Francisco Bay; and on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring the annual Windsor–Detroit International Freedom Festival, Detroit, Michigan hosts one of the largest fireworks displays in North America, over the Detroit River, to celebrate Independence Day in conjunction with Windsor, Ontario's celebration of Canada Day.\n\nThe first week of July is typically one of the busiest United States travel periods of the year, as many people use what is often a three-day holiday weekend for extended vacation trips.\n\n\nThe Philippines celebrates July 4 as its Republic Day to commemorate that day in 1946 when it ceased to be a U.S. territory and the United States officially recognized Philippine Independence.\nJuly 4 was intentionally chosen by the United States because it corresponds to its Independence Day, and this day was observed in the Philippines as Independence Day until 1962. In 1964, the name of the July 4 holiday was changed to Republic Day. Rebild National Park in Denmark is said to hold the largest July 4 celebrations outside of the United States.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "7437835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7437835", "title": "National Spot Exchange", "text": "National Spot Exchange\n\nThe National Spot Exchange Limited (NSEL) was India’s first electronic commodity spot exchange that was established in view of the then Prime Minister’s vision to create a “single market” across the country for both manufactured and agricultural produce. \nThe Economic Survey of 2002-03 of the Government of India also recommended setting up a national-level, integrated market for agricultural products, as did the Planning Commission. This was followed by the Rangarajan Committee, which too sought a national spot market. \n\nThe Government of India granted permission to NSEL along with two other spot exchanges to start operations. The Government of India issued a Gazette Notification dated June 5, 2007 granted general exemption under Section 27 of the Forward Contracts Regulation Act (FCRA.) \nNSEL commenced operations providing an electronic trading platform in October 2008 and simultaneously, as many as six state governments issued licenses under the model Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMC) Act to NSEL.\nIn August 2011, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) was appointed as the ‘designated agency’ to regulate these spot exchanges.\n\nImmediately after being designated the agency to supervise and regulate spot exchanges by the MoCA, the FMC sought clarification from NSEL regarding the fulfillment of conditions stipulated under the exemption notification.\nDespite the detail clarification given by the NSEL, the FMC wrongly, on April 10, 2012, sent a letter to MoCA misrepresenting facts and stating that NSEL had breached certain conditions of the exemption notification and in view thereof called upon the MoCA to take necessary action for such violation.\n\nIn view of this, on April 27, 2012, the MoCA issued show cause notice to NSEL. \nResponding twice to the show cause notice, NSEL wrote to the Ministry clarifying that the exemption granted to it under Section 27 of FCRA was general and not specific in nature.\n\nDespite giving a detailed explanation, there was no communication from the Ministry’s side for over a year and half. All said and done, the Ministry in a letter on July 12, 2013, pending legal advice, directed NSEL to halt launching of further and fresh contracts until further instruction from the concerned authority and to settle all existing contracts on the due dates. \n\nOn August 4, 2013, the FMC Chairman Mr Ramesh Abhishek had a meeting with defaulters and Brokers at Hotel Trident at BKC in Mumbai. After the meeting, Abhishek told the media: ‘There are 23 such entities who owe Rs 5,400 to the exchange and through exchange to the people who put money there. Sixteen entities came today and we had detailed discussions with them about how they are going to repay the money and the schedule, etc. And, we found that most of them were willing to repay in as little time as possible for them.’ \nOn August 6, 2013, the MoCA also issued a gazette notification giving omnibus powers to the FMC to take all actions necessary against all persons including defaulters, brokers, warehouses etc. for recovery. \nAfter the exchange closed abruptly, 24 entities collectively failed to honour their commitment, giving rise to a payment default of Rs 5,600 crore. The 24 entities also defaulted on their obligations after promising FMC Chairman Abhishek at the August 4, 2013 meeting that they will repay their dues in a phased manner. \nInstead of repaying the money, the defaulters not only diverted the proceeds of this crime into parallel businesses.\nLater, On August 22, 2014, the Bombay High Court categorically stated ‘The money invested has not come to NSEL, but has gone to the borrowers. i.e. bogus sellers. It is the borrowers who have been benefitted by the transactions and the money of 'investors' have gone to them. The names of 25 different companies who are the defaulters have been mentioned in the FIR itself. Thus, though projected a 'scam of Rs.5600 crores', the ill-gotten amount has not gone to the applicant (Jignesh Shah,) or for that matter, to NSEL.’\n\nEven the investigating agencies including the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai Police have traced the entire money trail of Rs.5,600 crore to the 24 defaulters. Not a single paisa has been found with NSEL, FTIL or its founder.\n\nOn August 5, 2016, in a written reply in Lok Sabha, the then Union Minister of State in Finance, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal also stated that ‘The entire amount which is gone to the brokers and defaulters belong to the 13,000 investors.’ \n\nIn the NSEL crisis, big brokers have many irregularities by mis-selling the products, misrepresenting the facts and manipulating the KYC and modifying the client code. \nConsidering the multiple complaints against the misdeeds of the brokers, in 2016, SEBI cracked the whip on the top powerful brokers by initiating an audit against those who sold NSEL contracts to their clients often presenting them as an assured return product, which in reality, were not. Five top brokers are under scanner as they have the highest exposure to NSEL from 2011 to 2013. \nThese brokers have been facing the regulatory heat, as SEBI has issued show cause notice for various irregularities done by them. The charges against these brokers are as follows:\n\n\nSEBI has issued two show-cause notices to the top five brokers namely Anand Rathi Commodities, India Infoline Commodities (IIFL), Geofin Comtrade, Motilal Oswal Commodities, and Phillip Commodities, on charges of mis-selling NSEL contracts by promising assured returns without ensuring delivery. \nThey also allegedly modified client codes for doing multiple deals. In the notice, SEBI asked these brokers as to why they should not be declared not “fit and proper” since they were found to have violated securities regulations.\nThe Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of Mumbai Police also found evidence of large-scale irregularities on the part of these brokers in the National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) case. A forensic audit by the EOW also revealed hawala transactions, benami trades and client code modifications by these brokers.\nIn fact, NSEL had repeatedly warned these members about selling contracts as assured return products to its trading clients and cautioned them not to offer any assured returns. \nNSEL had issued circulars cautioning its members to refrain from offering any such contracts by offering assured returns. \n\nIn the NSEL case, there have been claims of 13,000 trading clients who have faced monetary losses. However, the authenticity or genuineness of these so-called investors is under scrutiny. \nMany brokerage firms misused and cheated the trading clients by misrepresenting facts, mis-selling NSEL contracts and also misusing the KYC of trading clients without their knowledge and as a result of which, trapped them of huge exposures on the NSEL platform.\n\nOn June 27, 2016, some trading clients received notices from the income-tax department seeking details, among others, of source of funds, bad debt claimed during assessment years 2014-15 and 2015–16 and their transactions made on NSEL. \nAccording to the report in The Economic Times, the letter terms the claims by traders, brokers, and their nonbanking finance companies \"illegal\", \"multiple\" and for \"bogus losses\". It said the Rs 2,000-3,000 crore worth claims were causing losses to the exchequer. \nOn December 12, 2016, in a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, the then Minister of State for Finance, Shri Arjun Ram Meghwal also made it clear that the veracity of these investors is being looked into. He stated, “The EOW, Mumbai has the data of 12,768 investors, who claimed to have lost monies in NSEL. The verification of genuineness of investors can be done through the examination of the Know-Your-Customer (KYC) documents.” Mr Meghwal further clarified that the Income Tax Department, which is also investigating the investors, has not given a clean chit to any of these investors. \n\nThe Hon. Bombay High Court appointed committee has also questioned the genuineness of the trading clients and whether in fact there are 13,000 trading clients who have reportedly suffered due to the crisis.\nIn addition, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has sought detailed answers from the 13,000 so-called investors to uncover if the brokers induced them to trade in the commodities spot exchange. The 6-page questionnaire also wants answers on the non-payment of value-added tax at the time of trading.\n\n\nDr. Jatin Pancholi (Middlesex University, London, United Kingdom) found in his research that an emerging south Asian economy Hong Kong has faced a similar issue. Hong Kong Mercantile Exchange (HKMex) that was started in June 2008 is now closed in May 2013 on account of financial irregularities and false instruments. \nThe Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT), now known as Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is the world’s oldest futures and options exchange in the USA since 1848. The trading here is by both open-outcry and electronic methods. CME is regulated by rules and regulations of the National Futures Association (NFA) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In addition, the CME is regulated by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an independent agency of the USA government. Post 2008 financial crisis in the USA, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform & Consumer Protection Act has brought comprehensive reforms in the commodities and swaps markets. \n\nThe London International Financial Futures & Options Exchange (LIFFE), UK, formerly known as the London Commodities Exchange (LCE) is now a part of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). LIFFE is the biggest futures exchanges in the Europe and is recognized by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the new name of Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is a part of the government in the UK. The London Metal Exchange (LME) based in the UK has both market and member surveillance systems. \n\nIn November 2007, a European Union law on the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) has been passed to provide harmonised regulation for investment services across the 31 members (28 members of the European Union, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). MiFID has attempted to strike a delicate balance between controlled regulations and encouraged harmonious transactions. MiFID provides for position limits on commodity derivatives, prevents market abuse and supports orderly pricing and settlement conditions. The entire European market is being watched and regulated by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), based in Paris.\n\nDespite all the measures taken by NSEL, the FMC has misinformed the Ministry of Consumer Affairs that NSEL does not have resources, financial or organisational capability to recover the dues of the trading members. On February 12, 2016, the MCA issued the Final Order to forcefully amalgamate NSEL with its publicly listed parent, FTIL, completely undermining and ignoring the interest of FTIL’s 63,000+ shareholders in spite of their vehement opposition to the forced merger. \nOn February 15, 2016, The Hindu Business Line in its editorial stated: 'The use of Section 396 of the Companies Act to push through the merger also sets a bad precedent. The Centre has used this tool four times in the past, but it was done sensibly, and in a manner that protected the interests of both the entities being merged. NSEL, which has no operations currently, will only saddle FTIL with additional liabilities; this is against the interest of the minority shareholders of the company. Ironically, this is being done to protect investors savvy enough to trade on a commodity exchange.'\nOn February 16, 2016, The Economic Times in its editorial stated: 'The government has set a bad precedent with the forcible merger it has ordered of National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) into its promoter company, Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL). There are three problems with the move. One, it would go down as an instance of rare executive high-handedness, if it were to emerge, in the judicial challenge and resolution of the dispute that will now ensue, that this was not the right thing to do. Two, the natural order of priority for recovery of the outstanding dues of some Rs 5,600 crore owed to some traders would begin with the defaulting traders, proceed to the brokers involved and then the exchange, but the government has short-circuited the sequence by fixing the responsibility on the exchange and then shifting it to its promoter company. Three, the concept of limited liability, a cornerstone of modern entrepreneurship, stands revealed as having limited value in India’s regulatory apparatus.\n\nOn December 4, 2017, the Bombay High Court dismissed the petition filed by 63 moons technologies, previously FTIL, to oppose the forced merger of NSEL with FTIL. The execution of the order, however, has been held up for up to 12 weeks and 63 moons technologies plans to proceed with the case to the Supreme Court.\n"}

{"id": "728760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=728760", "title": "Path dependence", "text": "Path dependence\n\nPath dependence explains how the set of decisions one faces for any given circumstance is limited by the decisions one has made in the past or by the events that one has experienced, even though past circumstances may no longer be relevant.\n\nIn economics and the social sciences, path dependence can refer either to outcomes at a single moment in time, or to long-run equilibria of a process. In common usage, the phrase implies either:\nIn the first usage, (A), \"history matters\" is trivially true in many contexts; everything has causes, and sometimes different causes lead to different outcomes. In these contexts, the direct influence of earlier states may not be notable, unlike \"path-dependent\" options in finance, where the influence of history can be non-standard.\n\nIt is the narrow concept (B), that has the most explanatory force, and which is covered in this article.\n\nThe videotape format war is an example. Three mechanisms \"independent of product quality\" could explain how VHS achieved dominance over Betamax from a negligible early adoption lead:\n\nAn alternative analysis is that VHS was better-adapted to market demands (e.g. having a longer recording time). In this interpretation, path dependence had little to do with VHS's success, which would have occurred even if Betamax had established an early lead.\n\nPositive feedback mechanisms, like bandwagon and network effects, are at the origin of path dependence. They lead to a reinforcing pattern, in which industries 'tip' towards one or another product design. Uncoordinated standardisation can be observed in many other situations.\n\nPath dependence theory was originally developed by economists to explain technology adoption processes and industry evolution. The theoretical ideas have had a strong influence on evolutionary economics.\n\nThere are many models and empirical cases where economic processes do not progress steadily toward some pre-determined and unique equilibrium, but rather the nature of any equilibrium achieved depends partly on the process of getting there. Therefore, the outcome of a path-dependent process will often not converge towards a unique equilibrium, but will instead reach one of several equilibria (sometimes known as absorbing states).\n\nThis dynamic vision of economic evolution is very different from the tradition of neo-classical economics, which in its simplest form assumed that only a single outcome could possibly be reached, regardless of initial conditions or transitory events. With path dependence, both the starting point and 'accidental' events (noise) can have significant effects on the ultimate outcome. In each of the following examples it is possible to identify some random events that disrupted the ongoing course, with irreversible consequences:\n\nLiebowitz and Margolis distinguish \"types\" of path dependence; some do not imply inefficiencies and do not challenge the policy implications of neoclassical economics. Only \"third-degree\" path dependence — where switching gains are high, but transition is impractical — involves such a challenge. They argue that such situations should be rare for theoretical reasons, and that no real-world cases of private locked-in inefficiencies exist. Vergne and Durand qualify this critique by specifying the conditions under which path dependence theory can be tested empirically.\n\nTechnically, a path-dependent stochastic process has an asymptotic distribution that \"evolves as a consequence (function of) the process's own history\". This is also known as a non-ergodic stochastic process.\n\nIn \"The Theory of the Growth of the Firm\" (1959), Edith Penrose analyzed how the growth of a firm both organically and through acquisition is strongly influenced by the experience of its managers and the history of the firm's development.\n\nRecent methodological work in comparative politics and sociology has adapted the concept of path dependence into analyses of political and social phenomena. Path dependence has primarily been used in comparative-historical analyses of the development and persistence of institutions, whether they be social, political, or cultural. There are arguably two types of path-dependent processes:\n\n\nThe critical juncture framework has been used to explain the development and persistence of welfare states, labor incorporation in Latin America, and the variations in economic development between countries, among other things. Scholars such as Kathleen Thelen caution that the historical determinism in path-dependent frameworks is subject to constant disruption from institutional evolution.\n\nPaul Pierson's influential attempt to rigorously formalize path dependence within political science, draws partly on ideas from economics. Herman Schwartz has questioned those efforts, arguing that forces analogous to those identified in the economic literature are not pervasive in the political realm, where the strategic exercise of power gives rise to, and transforms, institutions.\n\nThe path-dependence of emergent strategy has been observed in behavioral experiments with individuals and groups.\n\nIn the social sciences, especially sociology and organizational theory, a distinct yet closely related concept to path dependence is the concept of \"imprinting\", which captures how initial environmental conditions leave a persistent mark (or imprint) on organizations and organizational collectives (such as industries and communities), thus continuing to shape organizational behaviours and outcomes in the long run, even as external environmental conditions change.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3064846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3064846", "title": "Philosophy of suicide", "text": "Philosophy of suicide\n\nIn ethics and other branches of philosophy, suicide poses difficult questions, answered differently by various philosophers. The French essayist, novelist, and playwright Albert Camus (1913–1960) began his philosophical essay \"The Myth of Sisyphus\" with the famous line \"There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide\" ().\n\nThere are arguments in favor of allowing an individual to choose between life and suicide. Those in favor of suicide as a personal choice reject the thought that suicide is always or usually irrational, but is instead a solution to real problems; a line of last resort that can legitimately be taken when the alternative is considered worse. They believe that no being should be made to suffer unnecessarily, and suicide provides an escape from suffering.\n\nHerodotus wrote: \"When life is so burdensome, death has become for man a sought-after refuge\". Schopenhauer affirmed: \"They tell us that suicide is the greatest act of cowardice... that suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in the world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.\"\n\nSchopenhauer's main work, \"The World as Will and Representation\", occasionally uses the act in its examples. He denied that suicide was immoral and saw it as one's right to take one's life. In an allegory, he compared ending one's life, when subject to great suffering, to waking up from sleep when experiencing a terrible nightmare. However, most suicides were seen as an act of the will, as it takes place when one denies life's pains, and is thus different from ascetic renunciation of the will, which denies life's pleasures.\n\nAccording to Schopenhauer, moral freedom—the highest ethical aim—is to be obtained only by a denial of the will to live. Far from being a denial, suicide is an emphatic assertion of this will. For it is in fleeing from the pleasures, not from the sufferings of life, that this denial consists. When a man destroys his existence as an individual, he is not by any means destroying his will to live. On the contrary, he would like to live if he could do so with satisfaction to himself; if he could assert his will against the power of circumstance; but circumstance is too strong for him.\n\nLiberalism asserts that a person's life belongs only to them, and no other person has the right to force their own ideals that life must be lived. Rather, only the individual involved can make such a decision, and whatever decision they make should be respected.\n\nPhilosopher and psychiatrist Thomas Szasz goes further, arguing that suicide is the most basic right of all. If freedom is self-ownership—ownership over one's own life and body—then the right to end that life is the most basic of all. If others can force you to live, you do not own yourself and belong to them.\n\nJean Améry, in his book \"On Suicide: a Discourse on Voluntary Death\" (originally published in German in 1976), provides a moving insight into the suicidal mind. He argues forcefully and almost romantically that suicide represents the ultimate freedom of humanity, justifying the act with phrases such as \"we only arrive at ourselves in a freely chosen death\" and lamenting \"ridiculously everyday life and its alienation\". Améry killed himself in 1978.\n\nPhilosophical thinking in the 19th and 20th century has led, in some cases, beyond thinking in terms of pro-choice, to the point that suicide is no longer a last resort, or even something that one must justify, but something that one must justify doing. Many forms of existentialist thinking essentially begin with the premise that life is objectively meaningless, and proceed to the question of why one should not just kill oneself; they then answer this question by suggesting that the individual has the power to give personal meaning to life.\n\nAlthough George Lyman Kittredge states that \"the Stoics held that suicide is cowardly and wrong,\" the most famous stoics—Seneca the Younger, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius—maintain that death by one's own hand is always an option and frequently more honorable than a life of protracted misery.\n\nThe Stoics accepted that suicide was permissible for the wise person in circumstances that might prevent them from living a virtuous life. Plutarch held that accepting life under tyranny would have compromised Cato's self-consistency () as a Stoic and impaired his freedom to make the honorable moral choices. Suicide could be justified if one fell victim to severe pain or disease, but otherwise suicide would usually be seen as a rejection of one's social duty.\n\nConfucianism holds that failure to follow certain values is worse than death; hence, suicide can be morally permissible, and even praiseworthy, if it is done for the sake of those values. The Confucian emphasis on loyalty, self-sacrifice, and honour has tended to encourage altruistic suicide. Confucius wrote, \"For gentlemen of purpose and men of ren while it is inconceivable that they should seek to stay alive at the expense of ren, it may happen that they have to accept death in order to have ren accomplished.\" Mencius wrote:\nCommon philosophical opinion of suicide since modernization reflected a spread in cultural beliefs of western societies that suicide is immoral and unethical. One popular argument is that many of the reasons for committing suicide—such as depression, emotional pain, or economic hardship—are transitory and can be ameliorated by therapy and through making changes to some aspects of one's life. A common adage in the discourse surrounding suicide prevention sums up this view: \"Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.\" However, the argument against this is that while emotional pain may seem transitory to most people, and in many cases it is, in other cases it may be extremely difficult or even impossible to resolve, even through counseling or lifestyle change, depending upon the severity of the affliction and the person's ability to cope with their pain. Examples of this are incurable disease or lifelong mental illness.\n\nThe French Algerian absurdist philosopher Albert Camus saw the goal of absurdism in establishing whether suicide is a necessary response to a world which appears to be mute both on the question of God's existence (and thus what such an existence might answer) and for our search for meaning and purpose in the world. For Camus, suicide was the rejection of freedom. He thinks that fleeing from the absurdity of reality into illusions, religion, or death is not the way out. Instead of fleeing the absurd meaninglessness of life, we should embrace life passionately.\n\nExistentialist Sartre describes the position of Meursault, the protagonist of Camus' \"The Stranger\" who is condemned to death, in the following way:\n\nG. K. Chesterton calls suicide \"the ultimate and absolute evil, the refusal to take an interest in existence\". He argues that a person who kills himself, as far as he is concerned, destroys the entire world (apparently exactly repeating Maimonides' view).\n\nJohn Stuart Mill argued, in his influential essay \"On Liberty\", that since the of liberty is the power of the individual to make choices, any choice that one might make that would deprive one of the ability to make further choices should be prevented. Thus, for Mill, selling oneself into slavery should be prevented in order to avoid precluding the ability to make further choices. Concerning these matters, Mill writes in \"On Liberty\"\n\nIt could be argued that suicide prevents further choices in the same way slavery does. However, it can also be argued that there are significant differences in not having any further involvement in decisions about your life and not having any further life to make decisions about. Suicide essentially removes the condition of being alive, not the condition of making choices about your life. \n\nMill believes the individual to be the best guardian of their own interests. He uses the example of a man about to cross a broken bridge: we can forcibly stop that person and warn him of the danger, but ultimately should not prevent him from crossing the bridge—for only \"he\" knows the worth of his life balanced against the danger of crossing the bridge.\n\nToo much should not be read into \"disposing of his own lot in life\" in the passage as this is not necessarily talking about anything other than slavery. Indeed, it would be odd if Mill had intended it to be about suicide but not explored the issue fully.\n\nFrom a deontological perspective, Immanuel Kant argues against suicide in \"Fundamental Principles of The Metaphysic of Morals\". In accordance with the second formulation of his categorical imperative, Kant argues that, \"He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.\" Kant's theory looks at the act only, and not at its outcomes and consequences, and claims that one is ethically required to consider whether one would be willing to \"universalise\" the act: to claim \"everyone\" should behave that way. Kant argues that choosing to commit suicide entails considering oneself as a means to an end, which he rejects: a person, he says, must \"not\" be used \"merely as means, but must in all actions always be considered as an end in himself.\" Therefore, it is unethical to commit suicide to satisfy oneself.\n\nThe social contract, according to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, is such that every man has \"a right to risk his own life in order to preserve it.\"\n\nHobbes and Locke reject the right of individuals to take their own life. Hobbes claims in his \"Leviathan\" that natural law forbids every man \"to do, that which is destructive of his life, or take away the means of preserving the same.\" Breaking this natural law is irrational and immoral. Hobbes also states that it is intuitively rational for men to want felicity and to fear death most.\n\nJapan has a form of suicide called seppuku, which is considered an honorable way to redeem oneself for transgressions or personal defeats. It was widely accepted in the days of the Samurai and even before that. It was generally seen as a privilege granted only to the samurai class; civilian criminals would thus not have this 'honor' and be executed. This reflects a view of suicide as brave and correct rather than cowardly and wrong.\n\nUtilitarianism can be used as a justification for, or an argument against, suicide. Though the death of a depressed person ends their suffering, the person's family and friends may grieve.\n\nDavid Hume left an essay on suicide to be published after his death. Most of it is concerned with the claim that suicide is an affront to God. Hume argues that suicide is no more a rebellion against God than is saving the life of someone who would otherwise die, or changing the position of anything in one's surroundings. He spends much less time dismissing arguments that it is an affront to one's duty to others or to oneself. Hume claims that suicide can be compared to retiring from society and becoming a total recluse, which is not normally considered to be immoral, although the comparison would not seem to justify a suicide that leaves in its wake children or dependents who are thereby rendered vulnerable. As for duty to self, Hume takes it to be obvious that there can be times when suicide is desirable, though he also thinks it ridiculous that anyone would consider suicide unless they first considered every other option.\n\nThose who support the right to die argue that suicide is acceptable under certain circumstances, such as incurable disease and old age. The idea is that although life is, in general, good, people who face irreversible suffering should not be forced to continue suffering.\n\nLeonard Peikoff states in his book \"\":\n\nBioethicist Jacob Appel has criticized \"arbitrary\" ethical systems that allow patients to refuse care when they are physically ill, while denying the mentally ill the right to suicide.\n\n\n\n"}

It opened on 18 November 1862 and functioned for 20 years, during which time over 5,000 performances were presented. Between 1866 and 1876 the theatre staged the premieres of four of Bedřich Smetana's operas, including \"The Bartered Bride\". The Provisional Theatre building was eventually incorporated into the structure of the National Theatre, which opened its doors on 11 June 1881.\n\nBefore the early 1860s almost all cultural institutions in Prague, including theatre and opera, were in Austrian hands. Bohemia was a province of the Habsburg Empire, and under that regime's absolutist rule most aspects of Czech culture and national life had been discouraged or suppressed. Absolutism was formally abolished by a decree of the Emperor Franz Josef on 20 October 1860, which led to a Czech cultural revival. The Bohemian \"Diet\" (parliament) had acquired a site in Prague on the banks of the Vltava, and in 1861 announced a public subscription, which raised a sum of 106,000 gulden. This covered the costs of building a small 800-seat theatre, which would act as a home for production of Czech drama and opera while longer-term plans for a permanent National Theatre could be implemented.\nThe Provisional Theatre opened on 18 November 1862, with a performance of Vítězslav Hálek's tragic drama \"King Vukašín\". Since there was at the time no Czech opera deemed suitable, the first opera performed at the theatre, on 20 November 1862, was Cherubini's \"Les deux journées\". For the first year or so of its life, the Provisional Theatre alternated opera with straight plays on a daily basis, but from the start of 1864 opera performances were given daily.\n\nThe first principal conductor (or musical director) of the Provisional Theatre, appointed in the autumn of 1862, was Jan Nepomuk Maýr – to the disappointment of Smetana, who had hoped for the position himself. Maýr held the position until September 1866; his tenure was marked by a professional rivalry with Smetana, who criticised the theatre's conservatism and failure to fulfil its mission to promote Czech opera. Maýr retaliated by refusing to conduct Smetana's \"The Brandenburgers in Bohemia\". A change in the theatre's management in 1866 led to Maýr's removal and replacement by Smetana, who held the post for eight years. Maýr's bias in favour of Italian opera was replaced by Smetana's more balanced repertoire, which mixed Italian, German and French pieces with such Slavonic and Czech works as he could find. Apart from his own compositions (\"The Bartered Bride\", \"The Brandenburgers in Bohemia\" and \"Dalibor\", Smetana introduced works by the Czech composers Lepold Eugen Měchura and Josef Rozkošný, but was nevertheless attacked by some parts of the music establishment for giving insufficient encouragement to native talent. Efforts to remove him from his post, and to reinstate Maýr, were unsuccessful.\n\nSmetana was responsible for the establishment of an independent school attached to the theatre. He became the school's director and professor of theory. However, in 1874 Smetana became afflicted with deafness, which forced him to yield his duties as principal conductor to his assistant Adolf Čech, and to resign his post later that year. Maýr was reappointed to the conductorship; he had no interest in the school, which subsequently closed. The Provisional Theatre continued as the main venue for Czech opera, several of Antonín Dvořák's works being premiered there. In 1881 the theatre was incorporated into the Czech National Theatre building, which opened on 11 June. Shortly thereafter the new building was badly damaged by fire and remained closed for two years. During this period the Provisional Theatre continued to operate, using other theatre premises. During its lifetime the Provisional theatre mounted more than 5,000 performances.\n\n"}

In order to improve future response, RedR focuses on capacity building and disaster risk reduction for communities affected by natural and man-made disasters.\n\nThey further help to ensure that skilled professionals are always available to respond to major global emergencies through an aid worker recruitment service and by advising and training potential new relief workers.\n\nRedR provides a free Technical Support Service to all relief organisations and aid workers around the world. The Technical Support Service consists of a panel of over 150 experts in a range of fields who aim to respond to any query within 24–48 hours.\n\nRedR UK is part of a federation of national accredited RedR organisations who all share a common vision and mission. As well as RedR UK, there are currently RedR organisations in Australia, Canada, India, Malaysia, New Zealand and South Africa.\n\nRedR was founded in London in 1980 by engineer Peter Guthrie following time spent delivering aid during the Vietnamese Boat People Crisis. Mr. Guthrie said: “When I returned [from the refugee crisis in Malaysia] I saw the pressing need for engineers to help in this sort of work and compiled a register of engineers who could be called upon at short notice to work with frontline relief agencies.”\n\nOn the advice of Oxfam’s chief engineer Jim Howard, Oxfam provided seed funding and RedR was formally registered as a charity.\n\nIn 1985, RedR faced its first major challenge with the onset of the Ethiopian Famine. A significant number of RedR Members were required to work on relief programmes in Ethiopia and neighbouring Sudan. In 1988 The Princess Royal became President of RedR, a position she still holds today.\n\nIn 1991 RedR UK’s training programme began. RedR Australia was founded the following year.\n\nIn 1994 the Rwanda crisis erupted and over 100 RedR Members were deployed to the Great Lakes region, while RedR New Zealand was established. A year later the first ever edition of ‘Engineering in Emergencies: A Practical Guide for Relief Workers’ by RedR Members Jan Davis and Robert Lambert was published.\n\nIn 1998 RedR launched its Technical Support Service for relief workers in the field and the following year their first regional training – Security Management - in Tirana, Albania.\n\nIn 2003 RedR merged with International Health Exchange (IHE), an organisation that improved the preparation and recruitment of health professionals for overseas emergency situations. RedR set up a programme office for the first time in East Africa.\n\nIn 2005, in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, RedR launched a ‘Learning Support and Capacity Building Programme’ in Sri Lanka and commenced a similar programme in Pakistan following the 2005 earthquake. In the same year RedR established a programme in Darfur, Sudan, in response to the country’s civil war and trained 4,000 national and international aid workers over the next five years.\n\nRedR became involved in the UN Cluster approach in 2006. RedR leads the training of aid workers within a number of cluster groups, including WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene), Emergency Shelter, Health and Nutrition.\n\nIn 2009 RedR linked with Oxford Brookes University to offer credit-rated courses in six of its training courses.\n\nFollowing the 2010 Haiti earthquake, RedR established a programme and trained 1,000 relief workers to support the response. 91% of trainees were Haitian nationals. RedR Lanka was also established in its own right to help assist in long term capacity building in Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 2011 RedR set up a country programme in South Sudan to assist with ongoing insecurity in the region.\n\nStarting late 2014 Redr took over training of UK NHS staff being deployed to Sierra Leone to respond to the Ebola Crisis in that country.\n\nThough RedR started as a register of engineers for disaster relief, it now focuses on training relief organisations and their staff worldwide. In 2010/2011 RedR trained 6,124 aid workers.\n\nRedR’s UK programme delivers a range of training courses, from a basic introduction to the sector to specialist courses for professional aid workers. RedR offers credit rated courses in partnership with Oxford Brookes University in an effort to further professionalise the humanitarian sector.\n\nCourse subjects delivered include: safety, security, logistics, shelter, WASH (Water, Sanitation & Hygiene), project management, and training of trainers.\n\nRedR’s Australia programme delivers a range of training courses, from the Essentials of Humanitarian Practice to courses in Personal Safety, Security and Communications, Humanitarian Logistics and Water and Sanitation in Emergencies as well as tailor made courses for professional aid workers. RedR offers credit rated courses in partnership with RMIT University, the University of Melbourne and Charles Darwin University in an effort to further professionalise the humanitarian sector.\n\nRedR Australia is also a Standby Partner to nine United Nations agencies including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children's Fund, World Health Organization, World Food Programme and UN Women. They recruit and maintain a roster of international experts who can deploy to work with these UN agencies and international non-government organisations following natural disasters and complex emergencies.\n\nRedR has country programmes in Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya and Pakistan. These programmes have been set up in response to the ongoing humanitarian crises in these regions and the needs of the various humanitarian organisations operating there. With high levels of insecurity, there is a focus on security training for aid agencies working in the field.\n\nRedR set up a new training programme in Islamabad in 2010 to support the humanitarian community within the country following the ongoing internal conflict in the North-West of the country. This follows a previous programme set up in response to the 2005 earthquake, which ran until June 2006.\n\nCourses currently delivered focus on security management, humanitarian training and humanitarian practice and principles.\n\nRedR established its Sudan Programme in 2005, specialising in safety and security training for aid workers due to the ongoing conflict in Darfur. It provides Staff Welfare and Critical Incident Training to humanitarian staff to help workers move on from traumatic experiences faced in insecure environments. As well as security training, RedR delivers a range of courses aimed at improving the capacity of both local and international aid agencies.\n\nRedR set up a new operation in South Sudan in preparation for the country’s separation from Sudan in July 2011. The training programme is based in the capital Juba and is unique to the country.\n\nRedR opened its humanitarian training centre in Nairobi, Kenya in September 2011. This was in response to the Horn of Africa Food Crisis in the summer of 2011. Funds for the project were raised partly through RedR’s East Africa Appeal.\n\nRedR provides an international bespoke training and consultancy service, covering all major aspects of humanitarian work. Disciplines include: Security Management, Personal Security, Training of Trainers for the Humanitarian Sector, Project Management in Emergencies, and Logistics.\n\nRedR tailor their existing modules or devise new courses to meet the needs of an organisation they are training. RedR trainers go to these organisations wherever they around the world, as opposed to RedR Country Programmes.\n\nIn 2010/2011 RedR delivered 51 bespoke courses in 21 countries worldwide; training 1,417 people.\n\nRedR provides a recruitment service for aid agencies, governments and private sector companies responding to major disasters through its Member’s register, which currently has a pool of about 1,700 specialists. RedR’s recruitment register focuses on all areas of the humanitarian sector, but specialises in engineering, health, logistics, security, and management consultants.\n\n\nRedR provides free online technical advice to humanitarian agencies and aid workers worldwide. This service gives access to 150 technical experts – including aid workers, academics and specialists from the corporate sector - who aim to reply to any query within 24–48 hours.\n\nRedR states its vision is a ‘world in which sufficient competent and committed personnel are available and responding to humanitarian needs.’\n\nRedR believes in the provision of humanitarian assistance to people wherever it is needed to relieve suffering and sickness.\n\nA key idea they integrate when responding to disasters is that people and communities affected by disasters themselves should be empowered to develop skills for immediate and future disaster response.\n\n\n"}

It also may include the intentional removal of the particulate filter. Practitioners often additionally modify their vehicles by installing smoke switches and smoke stacks. Modifications to a vehicle to enable rolling coal may cost from $200 to $5,000.\n\nRolling coal is a form of conspicuous air pollution, for entertainment or for protest. Some drivers intentionally trigger coal rolling in the presence of hybrid vehicles (when it is nicknamed \"Prius repellent\") to cause their drivers to lose sight of the road and inhale harmful air pollution. Coal rolling may also be directed at bicyclists, protesters, and pedestrians. Practitioners cite \"American freedom\" and a stand against \"rampant environmentalism\" as reasons for coal rolling. \n\nHealth risks associated with rolling coal include respiratory issues. The American Cancer Society has linked exposure to diesel exhaust to lung cancer. A more actionable concern is road traffic safety violations, as the black smoke can impair visibility, risking motor vehicle crashes. and violation of clean air laws.\n\nIn July 2014, the United States Environmental Protection Agency stated that the practice was illegal, as it violated the Clean Air Act which prohibits the manufacturing, sale, and installation \"of a part for a motor vehicle that bypasses, defeats, or renders inoperative any emission control device [and] prohibits anyone from tampering with an emission control device on a motor vehicle by removing it or making it inoperable prior to or after the sale or delivery to the buyer.\" In March 2015, Illinois General Assembly representative Will Guzzardi published a bill proposing to impose a $5,000 fine on anyone who removes or alters their vehicle's EPA emissions equipment. Guzzardi has made it clear that \"The fine would come on top of any penalties enforced by the current law that prohibits emissions tampering.\" \n\nIn May 2015, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law prohibiting the retrofitting of diesel-powered vehicles to increase particulate emissions for the purpose of coal rolling. Those found in violation are subject to a fine by the state's Department of Environmental Protection. The bill was introduced by state Assemblyman Tim Eustace after a pickup truck blasted smoke at Eustace's Nissan Leaf while driving on the New Jersey Turnpike. In Colorado and Maryland, proposed bans failed in 2016 but were passed in 2017.\n\n"}

{"id": "51498214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51498214", "title": "Sandra Cabrera", "text": "Sandra Cabrera\n\nSandra Cabrera (27 October 1970 – 27 January 2004) was an Argentine street-based sex worker, trade unionist, and campaigner for sex worker rights. She was killed in 2004 when her anti-corruption efforts started being successful and threatened police corruption networks and her defense of street workers' rights threatened brothel owners.\n\nCabrera was born in San Juan, Argentina\nin 1970. She moved to Rosario in 1994, leaving two children with her mother. People who met her remember her eyes, dark enough to seem black, a wealth of black hair, and her direct gaze, sometimes interpreted as inquisitive, \nsometimes as defiant.\nAt the time of her murder, she had been planning to travel to another city with a friend to attend a rock festival.\nHer first contact with AMMAR (Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina) occurred in 2000, but she didn't begin working with the union until 2001.\n\nDuring Argentina's economic crisis in 2001, Cabrera discovered the power of union association. She complained publicly that the lack of cash had left the women on the street desperately poor, to the point of not knowing if they would have food for their families on Christmas. The Ministry of Social Advancement gave the union sacks of food that Cabrera distributed, working from 8 in the morning to 10 at night.\n\nCabrera seems to have been a devoted mother to the daughter she called \"Maca\". She encouraged her education and ensured that she learned computer skills. She took her to the theater. At the time of the murder, Macarena was away at a scouting camp in Mendoza.\n\nCabrera's work to stop the spread of AIDS and other STDs began in October, 2001.\n\nLacking resources for its own place, AMMAR's Rosario chapter maintained an office with the Government Workers Association, where the AMMAR women were known affectionately as \"the Sanjua gang\", after Cabrera's place of origin. Cabrera reportedly had a love/hate relationship with AMMAR's national leadership. Her interactions with Elena Reynaga, Secretary General of the union at the time, have been described as \"explosive\". Reynaga acknowledged that no one she worked with fought her as Cabrera did, \nbut she also acknowledged Cabrera's effectiveness:\n\nOrganizing gave her a position in a social network that she couldn't get any other way.\n\nAnd in Rosario, she found that recognition.\n\nShe was the consummate union organizer. For two years before her murder, she used her motorcycle to take her every place in Rosario where her colleagues were working the street, listening to their complaints and planning how to use the union to protect them. After she died this was how many people remembered her; on her bike, distributing condoms, asking about people's problems. She learned how to make statements to the news media that the media would pick up and publish, spreading her message.\n\nPerhaps Cabrera's hardest task was just persuading her colleagues that a union was possible. Claudia Lucero, her close friend, sometime dancing partner, godmother of her daughter, and eventual successor as secretary general of the Rosario chapter of AMMAR, had to be won over.\n\nOther street workers had other reasons for not joining. Stella Maris Longoni found it easier just to pay her police extortionist fifty pesos a week and be left in peace, until the day she paid and the police arrested her anyway. Released from jail, with police warnings not to join the union still ringing in her ears, she went straight to Cabrera and AMMAR.\n\nDuring Sandra Cabrera's murder investigation, a source inside the investigation told a news reporter that Cabrera had been defending herself on three fronts: the violence and risk of working on the street, the assaults arranged by the brothel businesses she and her independent street colleagues were competing with, and the harassment and threats from the police whose graft networks she was disrupting. The corrupt connection between the brothel owners and the police meant that Cabrera's struggle to protect street workers was necessarily a struggle against corruption.\n\nBy way of background, the journalist Carlos del Frade has described a meeting in 1991 between Rodolfo Enrique Riegé, Secretary of Public Security for the province of Santa Fe, and Atilio Bléfari, head of police in Rosario. Riegé informed Bléfari that if he didn't increase the graft revenues that he was paying to Riegé, Riegé would relieve him of command and force him to retire. The resulting struggle for control of the city of Rosario was not a struggle between justice and corruption, but a struggle between a corrupt police officer and his even more corrupt superior. The document that del Frade cites as a source goes on to list the sources of extralegal income the police were collecting, which included theft of goods during transport, bank robbery, car theft, gambling, exploitation of juveniles in nightclubs and discos, and medical quackery, among other things. Category number two was income from the Public Morality units of the police, and included\n\nSince the nightclubs and discos were fronts for brothels, this can be summarized as drugs and prostitution.\n\nAs part of her campaign for sex worker rights, Cabrera fought for the elimination of the articles of the provincial Misdemeanor Code that criminalized prostitution. Different officers in Rosario's Public Morality unit were able to use the Code to play different sides. Some officers were paid by the brothel owners to enforce the Code against the street workers who were competing with the brothels. Other officers collected bribes from street workers for not enforcing the Code.\n\nAnother complication was her romantic involvement with an officer of the Federal police, Diego Parvlucyk. She acted as an informant and he gave her drugs that had been seized during police operations, which she sold. Initially her connection with the Federal police seemed to give her some protection from the provincial police, or at least a feeling of protection, but the relationship with Parvlucyk became more difficult and he was later arrested for her murder, although released and never tried. For many of Argentina's sex workers, this relationship didn't seem unusual.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2002, there is record of ten formal complaints made by Cabrera against the police. Most of them involve harassment or threats against her or a colleague.\n\nOn March 4, 2003, Marcela Patricia Morelli, a street sex worker and member of AMMAR, filed a complaint against officers of the Ludueña neighborhood police station. She and two trans sex workers had been detained by the officers in what she felt was an excessive manner and with \"a humiliating treatment\". One of the trans sex workers was released after two hours, but Morelli and the other remained for more than six hours. The police removed money and clothing from the other trans sex worker, humiliated the person, and left the person lying on the floor, naked. In the morning the station chief arrived and told them that he didn't want \"male or female prostitutes\" in his jurisdiction, and threatened more violent measures. He threatened to drag Morelli by her hair if he saw her again.\n\nAs leader of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Cabrera made the following statements.\n\nOn September 10, 2003, Cabrera organized a formal complaint against the chief and deputy chief of the Public Morality unit of the police, accusing them of harassing sex workers at the stops near the Rosario Bus Terminal in order to protect brothels in the area from competition from independent street workers. An investigation turned up evidence that they were providing protection for a brothel whose women included underage girls and women trafficked from the Dominican Republic. The complaint also accused police officers of forcing street-based sex workers to pay bribes in order to work. The chief and deputy chief were removed, and the new head of the Public Morality section was a woman, nominally chosen to ensure that the corrupt practices ended, but perhaps in reality chosen to take the pressure off without actually changing anything. Not quite five months later, when Cabrera was murdered, the disgraced ex-chief of Public Morality had been reassigned as head of the Zavalla police station.\nFollowing the complaint, some of the bars the two police chiefs had been protecting closed, and a few others stopped making payments to the police. One of the sex workers who joined Cabrera in the complaint testified during the murder investigation that Cabrera had expressed fear that the police would retaliate. \n\nOn October 9, someone called the headquarters of the Government Workers Association, where AMMAR kept an office, and said \"Tell Sandra that the girl will die before tomorrow.\" The girl was Cabrera's eight year old daughter, Macarena. From then until shortly before Cabrera's murder, the police Personal Security unit kept a nightly guard on her home.\n\nA few days later, an anonymous complaint filed in the juvenile courts claimed that \"Sandra sent the girl to beg and did not go to school.\" A social worker investigated and confirmed that Macarena had, in fact, been going to school.\n\nOn October 17 a sex worker was assaulted by a cyclist who struck her strongly in the head with a chain. The women went to the police and together they searched the area, but her assailant was never found.\n\nAt some point, while the police guard was temporarily away from Cabrera's home, someone got in and beat her. At another point, two men got into her home, put a gun to the head of her dog, and told her to stop fucking with them.\n\nThe last complaint Cabrera helped file, four days before her murder, involved an officer who charged a woman fifty pesos a week for the privilege of working without trouble from the police. In spite of punctual payments, the woman was arrested by the Public Morality police, who informed her that the officer she was paying was no longer working in that division. When she announced that she was going to join AMMAR, the Morality police threatened her with daily arrests. Cabrera went with her to file an extortion complaint and was with her when she spoke to the news media. Cabrera told a reporter that she was afraid that someone from the Public Morality unit would come back for her.\n\nDuring her murder investigation, the investigating judge found evidence of fifteen death threats against her.\n\nTestimony indicates that Sandra Cabrera was standing at her usual corner with a colleague at around 4:30 on the morning of 27 January 2004. She was approached by a client and walked toward him, away from her colleague. The colleague never saw the man's face and didn't recognize him. From behind, he appeared to be tall and thin, in light shorts. Cabrera and the client left together to go to her home.\n\nShe was found dead from a shot in the back of the neck. The investigation determined that the muzzle of the gun had been pushed against her neck and the gun was partially supported by her skull when it was fired.\nHer body was two blocks from the Omnibus Terminal, one block from the stop where she worked. \nThere were no scuff marks on her sandals or clothes, indicating that she had not been dragged, but had been killed where she was found. The bullet that killed her has been sometimes reported to be a 9 mm, but news reports at the time of the investigation said the investigators found a .32 caliber slug. (Various police departments in Argentina have issued 9 mm handguns to their officers (Bersa Thunder 9), but the .32 caliber bullet is considered too small for police work.)\n\nHer pants were pulled down below her hips but her underpants were in their normal position. A condom wrapper was found next to her body.\nThe police lab found semen in her vaginal and anal cavities. Testimony indicated that she had had sex with her lover a couple of hours before she was last seen alive.\n\nAnalysis by forensic experts suggests a planned assassination, not a spur-of-the-moment crime of passion. Her killer was probably either familiar with the area, or had cased it ahead of time, and led her to the entry of a private house where they were less likely to be observed. The murder weapon was a small caliber handgun that was easier to hide than the larger handguns issued by police departments. The killer apparently knew how to use a smaller weapon to ensure that Cabrera was killed by one shot, without the need for a second. The forensic analysts believe that he stood behind her, held her head with his left hand, forced the muzzle of the gun against her neck, and fired while standing with his knees slightly flexed. She died instantly.\n\nThe forensic report concluded:\n\nHer murder was a shock to the national political system. Almost immediately the national Minister of Justice got in touch with the Santa Fe governor, and the Secretary for National Human Rights came to Rosario to get involved in the case. Within two days the investigating judge had convened a multi-disciplinary meeting at the Institute of Forensic Medicine with ten forensic experts; an extraordinary step in any murder case, much less a case involving a street-based sex worker.\nThe investigating judge laid out three lines of investigation: she was killed by a client, she was killed by the brothel owners, or she was killed by the police. At the time, there were no reports of clients committing crimes against prostitutes. Sources in the police department reported that the police were seriously looking into the possibility that she had been killed by someone hired by the brothel owners. Her first encounter with AMMAR occurred when she complained to the media about being assaulted by pimps and bouncers, i.e. by men associated with a bar that was a front for a brothel. The two chiefs of the Public Morality unit who were removed after her complaint were being paid by brothel owners to drive off street sex workers. Her struggle against the brothel owners went back many years.\n\nEveryone else assumed it was the police. The police in Argentina have a history of killing reformers and killing sex workers. A few years earlier, investigators in Mar del Plata had uncovered a police conspiracy to use a fictional serial killer to cover up the murder of thirty two sex workers,\n\nkilled because they wanted to leave their pimps, who were paying the police. \nThe Santa Fe police killed the social activist Claudio Lepratti during the disturbances of 2001 when he tried to warn them off from firing at a school where children were eating lunch. At Cabrera's funeral procession, the AMMAR members shouted \"We know, we know, that our colleague was killed by the police.\"\n\nAmong political insiders and unionists there were two theories about the police. The first was that they killed Cabrera to silence her. The second was that they killed her to warn the new provincial government in Santa Fe to stop interfering with the graft. Changes of administrations in Santa Fe had typically been accompanied by some sort of organized criminal action by the police, just to remind everybody of the rules of the game. Carlos del Frade relates that during Obeid's first administration as governor of Santa Fe, he removed a half dozen police officers who had been involved in state sponsored torture and terrorism. The police responded with a message that if he removed any more police officers, it would break the institutional peace in the province.\n\nThe previous administration had responded to Cabrera's complaints by removing high ranking officers for corruption, and the new administration was arresting street level officers for extortion. This second theory implies that Cabrera's killers just wanted to warn off the government from the dangerous experiment of punishing police officers for corruption.\n\nTo show its resolve in moving the case forward, the provincial government quickly appointed a committee of five police officers to investigate. The committee was under the direct orders of José Manuel Maldonado, head of Regional Unit II of the provincial police; in effect, chief of police for the city of Rosario. Previously, as head of the Judicial Police, he had been accused of shielding officers involved with the killing of Claudio Lepratti and protecting 1st Precinct policemen accused of raping a sixteen year old girl. According to the assistant secretary of the CTA (the union federation AMMAR belongs to), Maldonado ensured that proceeds from the payments extorted from sex workers and the money that pimps paid for protection were distributed to officers and politicians appropriately. The unit he currently headed had been linked three years previously to extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody. So he was head of a police unit accused of exactly the type of assassination people were accusing the police of in the Cabrera case, he was believed to be responsible for administering the graft that she had been campaigning against, and he appeared to be experienced in covering up police crimes. The CTA and the Rosario association of prosecutors demanded his removal.\n\nAfter several months of investigation, the investigating judge ordered the detention of Parvlucyk, the Federal police officer Cabrera had been involved with, and charged him with murder. In addition to their troubled relationship, Parvlucyk had stated in his testimony that his immediate superior had asked him to silence Cabrera, and his superior has stated that Parvlucyk always complied with orders.\nOn appeal, the judge's decision was overturned, and neither Parvlucyk nor anyone else has been tried for Cabrera's murder. The panel of judges that overturned the decision of the investigating judge referred to some of the witnesses as \"\"people with street activities who pass their mornings with a wandering itinerary\". One of the appeals judges discredited the testimony of over twenty street-based sex workers because they were women who \"have an activity that can not be described as good morals,\" according to the journalist Carlos Del Frade. He claims that the possibility that Parvlucyk killed Cabrera because he was ordered to silence her was never properly investigated. Del Frade also claims that the link between Cabrera's murder and the structural corruption in the provincial and Federal police organizations was never investigated.\n\nAmong the members of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, the reaction to Cabrera's murder was a mixture of fear and bravado. \"If AMMAR dies, we fatten the pigs,\" they told each other, and \"She paid for everything, and that's why the fight continues.\" But when Cabrera's friend Claudia Lucero took over as general secretary of the chapter, she found it sometimes difficult to reach out to her colleagues. They warned her, \"Don't get involved, you'll end up like Sandra.\" A lawyer who worked for CTA, the trade union federation that AMMAR is part of, and who represented AMMAR during the murder investigation, said that some of the women who might have testified refused to get involved in the case, and others left Santa Fe province out of fear. Four years later, Lucero reported similar fear among the street workers.\n\nAs for Macarena Cabrera, Sandra's daughter, one can only imagine her reaction to it all. Growing up she had access to the Internet and knew about the failure of the murder investigation and the various theories people proposed. Nine years after the murder she went to the Rosario branch of the Government Workers Association, the union that had provided AMMAR Rosario with office space and where her mother had been well known, and told them she really wanted to know what happened to her mother. They were probably able to give her a lot of information, but the source for this says that actual explanations were in short supply.\n\nIf the police were, in fact, trying to send a message to the new provincial administration, it backfired. Cabrera's murder gave the government the political cover it needed to eliminate the Public Morality section of the provincial police. High on the list of her legacies is the fact that two days after her murder, the Santa Fe Minister of Government announced that the Public Morality section would be dissolved and the officers that served in it would be distributed among different units. He said that the move had been under consideration since the beginning of the new administration:\n\nBut he acknowledged that he was making the announcement in the context of Cabrera's murder.\nOn the other hand, the government wanted to amend, rather than repeal, the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized sex work and transgenderism. The political opposition favored straight repeal, but the government was concerned about voter reaction and opposition from the Church. As the Minister of Government put it with Victorian sensibility:\n\nAs the new secretary general of AMMAR's Rosario chapter, Claudia Lucero continued the campaign to repeal the articles.\n\nFor AMMAR Rosario, the campaign was an important rallying point. The constant police harassment intimidated the women in the street, but it also gave them strong motivation to take steps, however risky, to join the campaign against laws that legitimized the harassment. And since the campaign had been Cabrera's initiative, it gave the union frequent opportunity to invoke the name of Sandra Cabrera, who had become an important symbol for sex workers' rights.\n\nFinally, in 2010, after years of lobbying and activism by AMMAR Rosario, a different administration repealed the articles of the law that Cabrera had campaigned against.\nWhile she didn't live to see the victory, she was part of the fight, and it was a more fundamental restructuring of society's relationship with sex work than eliminating a police unit.\n\nWalter Miranda, who had been removed as chief of the Public Morality unit following Cabrera's complaint because he had been providing protection to brothels that trafficked underage girls and foreign women, as well as extorting bribes from street-based sex workers, continued to advance through the ranks. By 2012 he had become head of Regional Unit II, which gave him control of all provincial police forces in the city of Rosario. The brothels in the area around the bus terminal that he had been protecting were still there. During an investigation of trafficking in humans, a phone tap of one of the brothel owners recorded the owner asking how to go about selling cocaine. The answer was that he should bribe Hugo Tognoli, the highest ranking police officer in the province of Santa Fe. Laura Cosido, a judge in the Federal Chamber of Rosario, stated that \"There was never such an open relationship between narcos and police.\" AMMAR, Cabrera's union, complained that the drug and human trafficking networks were the same.\nAround the same time, Claudia Lucero was complaining that in spite of the revocation of the articles of the Misdemeanor Code that criminalized street prostitution, the police were still finding ways to extort money from street workers.\n\nShortly thereafter, sex work in Rosario went through the same change in law and enforcement that the rest of Argentina experienced. The anti-trafficking law, passed a few years earlier, began to be enforced consistently, ending the legal regulation of brothels by municipalities. One of the last cabarets in Rosario was closed when city inspectors found an entertainer performing oral sex on a customer. Announcing that they were closing the place, the inspectors were attacked by the madame and the female employees, who threw glasses and punched and kicked the inspectors. Driven into the street, they took refuge in a local bar where the women found them and again attacked, throwing and breaking tables and stealing the tape used to officially seal a closed business. Not everyone in Argentina embraced the new anti-trafficking regime.\n\nSome of the women who had worked in the cabarets and \"whiskerías\" that fronted for brothels moved to private apartments operated by the same type of people who had operated the brothels.\nThe motels that once rented to independent sex workers now turn them away in order to avoid problems with the city. In response, some of the women have organized \"casitas\", where a group of women rent a house and set aside a part of the earnings from each client session to cover the rent. Basically, women who were previously working in brothels are still working in brothels, and women who were previously independent are still independent. Georgina Orellano, secretary general of AMMAR as of 2017, says of the new legal regime that \"It took all the activity to a much darker and hidden place.\"\n\nFor the street based workers, Orellano says that since Mauricio Macri became Argentina's president, institutional violence has increased in public spaces.\n\nOrellano says that the new prohibitionist regime recognizes only victims and pimps, and criminalizes women who enter sex work voluntarily. The current municipal law on sex work in Rosario, passed in 2013, mentions assistance and support; Orellano says that the city department responsible for implementing the assistance has helped so few women that they can be counted on the fingers of the two hands. AMMAR's last survey found one hundred women working the streets in Rosario, and it is estimated that another six hundred are working indoors.\n\nThe legal and police system that Sandra Cabrera struggled with has changed. Where it once tolerated brothels it has become prohibitionist. The laws that once referred to street based sex work as \"scandalous\" and an \"offense to modesty\" now speak of assisting sex workers. The owners of regulated brothels who once assaulted independent sex workers in the streets, or paid the police to do the same, now operate illegally in private apartments, driven underground by the prohibitionist movement that currently opposes AMMAR in the media and the legislatures. The political projects of Cabrera and AMMAR's founders have been challenged by new social forces with different concepts of sex worker rights and agency. And yet street based sex workers face the same problems, including police violence and extortion. Perhaps Cabrera's most important legacy is illustrated by a little story told by Claudia Lucero a year after Cabrera's death:\n\nNine days after Cabrera's murder, marches were held in Rosario, Buenos Aires, and Salta province, demanding justice and sex workers rights. The counts of participants weren't given for the marches, but the Rosario march was described as \"multitudinous\" and included a cross section of Rosario civic society, including leaders of political parties, unions, and human rights groups.\nAnother march in Rosario a month later was described in the same terms and included the same civic groups.\nThese marches have been repeated over the years on the anniversary of her murder, up to the present.\n\nIn 2012 the director Lucrecia Mastrangelo released a film titled, \"Sex, dignity and death: Sandra Cabrera, unpunished crime\".\n\nIn 2017, a small public square in the area around the bus terminal where she had worked was named in her honor.\n"}

Reuben (born 1958) is an American anesthesiologist who was Professor of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts and chief of acute pain at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts from February 1991 until 2009 when he was sentenced to prison for healthcare fraud. Reuben was considered to be a prolific and influential researcher in pain management, and his purported findings altered the way millions of patients are treated for pain during and after orthopedic surgeries. Reuben has now admitted that he never conducted any of the clinical trials on which his conclusions were based \"in what may be considered the longest-running and widest-ranging cases of academic fraud.\" \"Scientific American\" has called Reuben the medical equivalent of Bernie Madoff, the former NASDAQ chairman who was convicted of orchestrating a $65-billion Ponzi scheme.\n\nReuben was educated at Columbia University. He graduated from medical school at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1985 and undertook his anesthesiology residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.\n\nReuben fell under suspicion when Baystate conducted a routine audit in May 2008 which revealed that Reuben had not been given approval for two studies that he intended to present during the hospital's research week. On March 10, 2009 a Baystate spokeswoman announced that Reuben admitted to fabricating many of the data underlying his research. Reuben never conducted the clinical trials that he wrote about in 21 journal articles dating from at least 1996. In some cases, he even invented the patients. Although Reuben often co-wrote papers with other researchers, Baystate found that the other researchers did not know about or participate in Reuben's studies, and their names were forged on documents. The hospital asked the journals to retract the studies, which reported favorable results from painkillers including Pfizer Inc.'s Bextra, Celebrex and Lyrica and Merck & Co. Inc.'s Vioxx. His studies also claimed Wyeth's antidepressant Effexor could be used as a painkiller. Pfizer gave Reuben five research grants between 2002 and 2007. He was a paid member of the company's speakers bureau, giving talks about Pfizer drugs to colleagues. Reuben also wrote to the Food and Drug Administration, urging the agency not to restrict the use of many of the painkillers he studied, citing his own data on their safety and effectiveness.\n\n\"Doctors have been using (his) findings very widely,\" said Steven Shafer, editor of \"Anesthesia and Analgesia\", a scientific journal that published ten articles identified as containing fraudulent data. \"His findings had a huge impact on the field.\" He also described Reuben's actions as the biggest case of fraud in the history of anesthesiology. Paul White, \"another editor at the journal, estimates that Reuben's studies led to the sale of billions of dollars' worth of drugs which may have actually slowed down recovery times for patients.\"\n\nReuben's work had actually come under scrutiny as early as 2007, when several anesthesiologists noticed his studies never showed negative results. Greg Koski, former director of the Office for Human Research Protections, said the fraud was unusual because Reuben was able to carry it on for almost 13 years without being caught by the peer review process.\n\nAll of Reuben's 21 fraudulent articles, as well as the article abstracts, are documented in Healthcare Ledger Magazine.\n\nTufts has since cut ties with Reuben,and his Massachusetts medical license was permanently revoked after a period in which he voluntarily agreed not to practice.\n\nOn January 7, 2010 Reuben agreed to plead guilty to one count of health care fraud. Prosecutors alleged that Reuben obtained thousands of dollars in grants for research that he never performed. He formally pleaded guilty on February 21, 2010 before Judge Michael Ponsor. On May 24, Ponsor sentenced him to six months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. He was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine, forfeit $50,000 to the government and make $360,000 in restitution to pharmaceutical companies. The plea deal effectively ended his career as a doctor; most states will not grant medical licenses to convicted felons.\n\nOn November 16, 2011 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an order permanently debarring Reuben from assisting in drug applications.\n\nA 2009 review of systematic review articles used in evidence-based medicine found that while some reviews were no longer valid when the Reuben studies were removed, the conclusions in the majority of them remained unchanged. The review found that the key Reuben claims that needed to be re-examined were \"the absence of detrimental effects of coxibs on bone healing after spine surgery, the beneficial long-term outcome after preemptive administration of coxibs including an allegedly decreased incidence of chronic pain after surgery, and the analgesic efficacy of ketorolac or clonidine when added to local anesthetics for intravenous regional anesthesia.\"\n\nIn 2010 the editorial in \"Anaesthesia\" argued that,\n\nAlthough Pfizer \"underwrote much of Dr. Reuben’s research from 2002 to 2007\" and \"many of his trials found that Celebrex and Lyrica, Pfizer drugs, were effective against postoperative pain\" Pfizer was not aware of the fraudulent data.\n\n"}
{"id": "316022", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=316022", "title": "Sestos", "text": "Sestos\n\nSestos () or Sestus was an ancient Greek town of the Thracian Chersonese, the modern Gallipoli peninsula in European Turkey. Situated on the Hellespont opposite Abydos, it was the home of Hero in the legend of Hero and Leander, where according to legend she lived in a tower overlooking the sea. Sestos was an Aeolian colony, as it was founded by settlers from Lesbos. The ruins of the town are near to the modern settlement of Eceabat.\n\nDuring the Persian rule, Sestos alongside Byzantium were the two Achaemenid ports of utmost importance on the European coasts of the Bosphorus and the Hellespont. In 480 BC, Xerxes' army crossed at this point on two temporary pontoon bridges later known as Xerxes' Pontoon Bridges, and most of Alexander the Great's forces went the other way here by boat in 334 BC.\n\nIn 1810 Lord Byron swam from Sestos to Abydos in one hour 10 minutes, recreating Leander's feat, and wrote a poem thereafter. This event is commemorated every year with an annual swim event that recreates the crossing.\n\nLittle now remains of the ancient town of Sestos.\n\nSestos is central to Christopher Marlowe's poem \"Hero and Leander\", and is referred to in its opening lines:\n<poem>\n\"On Hellespont, guilty of true love's blood,\n\"In view and opposite two cities stood,\n\"Sea-borderers, disjoin'd by Neptune's might:\n\"The one Abydos, the other Sestos hight.\n\"At Sestos Hero dwelt; Hero the fair,\n\"Whom young Apollo courted for her hair.\n</poem>\nThe poem's two parts are called \"Sestiads\".\n\nIn 479-478 BC, after the Greek victories (against Persia) at Plataea and Mycale, Greek forces under the command of Xanthippus besieged the Persian forces. The Athenians attacked the Persian forces, and defeated the Persians. Since the Persians were defeated, the Persian garrison at Sestos allowed the Greeks to conquer the city. As a result, Persian influence along the Hellespont was significantly reduced. This served the dual goal of denying Persian land forces access to the Greek mainland, while restoring Athenian trade to Black Sea ports such as Byzantium.\n"}
{"id": "403786", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=403786", "title": "Smear campaign", "text": "Smear campaign\n\nA smear campaign, also referred to as a smear tactic or simply a smear, is an effort to damage or call into question someone's reputation, by propounding negative propaganda. It can be applied to individuals or groups.\n\nCommon targets are public officials, politicians, political candidates, activists and ex-spouses. The term also applies in other contexts such as the workplace.\n\nThe term \"smear campaign\" became popular around 1936.\n\nA smear campaign is an intentional, premeditated effort to undermine an individual's or group's reputation, credibility, and character. Like negative campaigning, most often smear campaigns target government officials, politicians, political candidates, and other public figures. However, private persons or groups may also become targets of smear campaigns perpetrated in companies, institutions, the legal system, and other formal groups.\n\nSmear tactics differ from normal discourse or debate in that they do not bear upon the issues or arguments in question. A smear is a simple attempt to malign a group or an individual with the aim of undermining their credibility.\n\nSmears often consist of ad hominem attacks in the form of unverifiable rumors and distortions, half-truths, or even outright lies; smear campaigns are often propagated by gossip magazines. Even when the facts behind a smear campaign are demonstrated to lack proper foundation, the tactic is often effective because the target's reputation is tarnished before the truth is known.\n\nSmears are also effective in diverting attention away from the matter in question and onto a specific individual or group. The target of the smear typically must focus on correcting the false information rather than on the original issue.\n\nDeflection has been described as a \"wrap-up smear\": \"You make up something. Then you have the press write about it. And then you say, everybody is writing about this charge\".\n\nSmear tactics are considered by many to be a low, disingenuous form of discourse; they are nevertheless very common.\n\nSmear campaigns have been identified as a common weapon of psychopaths, Borderlines and narcissists.\n\nIn many countries, the law recognizes the value of reputation and credibility. Both libel (a false and damaging publication) and slander (a false and damaging oral statement) are often punishable by law and may result in imprisonment or compensation or fees for damages done.\n\nSmear tactics are commonly used to undermine effective arguments or critiques.\n\nDuring the 1856 presidential election, John C. Frémont was the target of a smear campaign alleging that he was a Catholic. The campaign was designed to undermine support for Fremont from those who were suspicious of Catholics.\n\nRalph Nader was the victim of a smear campaign during the 1960s, when he was campaigning for car safety. In order to smear Nader and deflect public attention from his campaign, General Motors engaged private investigators to search for damaging or embarrassing incidents from his past. In early March 1966, several media outlets, including \"The New Republic\" and \"The New York Times\", reported that GM had tried to discredit Nader, hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations. Nader sued the company for invasion of privacy and settled the case for $284,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the New York Court of Appeals, whose opinion in the case expanded tort law to cover \"overzealous surveillance.\" Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.\n\nGary Hart was the target of a smear campaign during the 1988 US presidential campaign. Smear campaigns are a campaign tactic associated with yellow journalism which is a type of journalism that presents little well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines, scandal-mongering and sensationalism. For example, during Gary Hart's 1988 presidential campaign, the \"New York Post\" reported on its front page big, black block letters: \"GARY: I'M NO WOMANIZER.\"\n\nCountries have used smear campaigns to attempt to discredit Western companies. In 2011, China launched a smear campaign against Apple, including TV and radio advertisements and articles in state-run papers. The campaign failed to turn the Chinese public against the company and its products.\n\nSpiritual leader Sathya Sai Baba was accused of fraud, sexual abuse and other misconduct. Baba described the allegations as a \"smear campaign\". He never faced any investigation and the critics were criticized for lacking any proof against him.\n\nThe allegations against Julian Assange have been labelled by Australian journalist John Pilger as a smear campaign.\n\nIn 2016, Brad Pitt was the target of a smear campaign related to his child custody dispute. Pitt was alleged to have acted inappropriately during an argument with his 15-year-old son.\n\nChris Bryant, a British parliamentarian, accused Russia in 2012 of orchestrating a smear campaign against him because of his criticism of Vladimir Putin. In 2017 he alleged that other British officials are vulnerable to Russian smear campaigns.\n\nIn January 2007, it was revealed that an anonymous website that attacked critics of Overstock.com, including media figures and private citizens on message boards, was operated by an official of Overstock.com.\n\nCountries, particularly those outside the Western hemisphere, have accused Western powers of smear campaigns to bring down their governments. Gambia accused the United States and Britain of backing \"so-called Gambians to set up organisations and media facilities to spread nothing but lies against The Gambia by making false, outrageous and unfounded statements about the state of human rights.\"\n\nIn 2016, a Deutsche Welle journalist, Nemanja Rujević, published a text accusing Saša Radulović leader of the Enough is Enough party, of a tax debt of a few million dollars. Since released (titled \"A milion is enough\"), it has been used in political campaigning against him by the SNS ruling party. He claimed that it was all fabricated and that he will sue its author. Although Saša Radulović was never charged of avoiding to pay tax, and no warrant has been issued for his arrest, this article has been used often against his political engagement mostly by the president of the SNS party, Aleksandar Vučić.\n"}

The fair has taken place every year since 1886 except for varying periods during World War I and World War II. It usually begins the last Friday in September and ends 24 days later. While an annual attendance of over 2 million, it is consistently recognized as one of the most highly attended and best state fairs in America as well as Dallas's signature event.\n\nThe State Fair of Texas opening day ceremonies are highlighted by the annual Friday parade rolling through downtown Dallas.\n\nTraditionally, the centerpiece of the fair has been the annual college football game between Oklahoma and Texas, nicknamed the Red River Rivalry (historically known as both the \"OU-Texas Game\" or \"Texas-OU Game\") and played in the Cotton Bowl at Fair Park. Also, the State Fair Classic, featuring Grambling State University and Prairie View A&M University, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the fair. In 2010, Baylor and Texas Tech played their game during the fair for the first time. During the opening weekend of the 2013 fair, Army and Louisiana Tech played in the only Heart of Dallas Classic at the Cotton Bowl; it was abandoned thereafter. The new Texas State Fair Football Showdown is scheduled to take place on the third weekend of the 2018 and 2019 fair and will feature Southern and Texas Southern.\n\nThe State Fair of Texas is the only fair in the US to include a full auto show, dating back to 1913.\n\nThe State Fair used to feature \"Birds of the World\" where several birds flew overhead. It was removed from the Fair lineup in 2014. The Texas Skyway is a gondola ride which only operates 24 days a year transports visitors around the fairgrounds. Its construction cost 5 million dollars. There is also a BMX bike show as well as dog and pig races. For children, puppet shows, Children's Medical Center Barnyard, and Story Time also take place inside the fair.\n\nIn recent years, the fair has emphasized its reputation as an event featuring unique, albeit high-fat foods. It has been known for years for Fletcher's brand corny dogs. Recent years have seen the introduction of new unusual deep-fried items, including deep-fried Oreos, deep-fried Twinkies, deep-fried s'mores, deep-fried pork ribs, fried cheesecake; deep-fried butter, fried avocados, deep-fried peanut butter, jelly, and banana sandwiches, and most recently a batter-based fried Coke. New foods in 2008 included chicken fried bacon and fried banana splits. For the 2012 fair, the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas added the deep-fried Samoa cookie.\n\nOriginally what was known as the State Fair of Texas was held in Houston from 1870 through 1878.\n\nIn its modern incarnation, the State Fair of Texas was charted as a private corporation by local businessmen. It was an immediate success and attracted thousands of people. However, in 1904 a series of events led to a financial crisis and not enough income was available to keep the fair running. Therefore, the businessmen sold it to the city of Dallas with the agreement that 24 days during the fall would be set aside annually for the fair and exhibition.\n\nBig Tex, a tall cowboy statue, has been its symbol since his introduction in 1952. In 1953, Big Tex's jaw was hinged, so that he appears to \"speak\" the announcements that promote fair events. After a fire on October 19, 2012 destroyed the original Big Tex, he was rebuilt and reintroduced for the 2013 fair. Big Tex is claimed to be the world's tallest cowboy.\n\nIts Texas Star Ferris wheel was the largest in North America when it debuted in October 1985, just months before the Texas Sesquicentennial. It has since been dwarfed by Ferris wheels in Las Vegas and Orlando.\n\nDART's Fair Park Station and MLK Jr. Station opened in 2009 to serve Fair Park and the State Fair. In addition to regular service on the Green Line, the Red Line and Blue Line also run \"special event\" trains to Fair Park Station for major fair events.\n\nIn 1955, Juanita Craft organized a protest of the State Fair of Texas against its policy of admitting blacks only on \"Negro Achievement Day.\" \n\nThe State Fair in 1966 commissioned a report on the redevelopment of the fair, which concluded that the land around Fair Park should be `bought up and turned into a paved, lighted, fenced parking lot\" that would `eliminate the problem from sight'. \"If the poor Negroes in their shacks cannot be seen, all the guilt feelings…will disappear, or at least be removed from primary consideration\".\n\nThe State Fair came under fire in October 2014 for spending over $5,000,000 on attorneys fees to two insiders.\n\nDespite a $30,000,000 investment in Summer Adventures, the event was shuttered after just one season.\n\nIn August 2015, the State Fair was sanctioned more than $75,000 for filing a SLAPP suit[34] against a lawyer who had requested financial documents from the State Fair. On August 2, 2016, the Dallas Court of Appeals reversed in its entirety the judgment against the State Fair of Texas, holding that the trial court erred in, among other things, finding that the State Fair's lawsuit was a SLAPP suit.\n\n\n\n ·on September 9 2017, Charlie Daniels plays famous song Devil Went Down to Georgia\n\nThe economics, finances and management of the State Fair of Texas is a matter of public concern and study. The five main areas of concern are:\n\n\nStaff of the State Fair have traditionally reported that attendance at the fair runs in the vicinity each year of between 3 and 3.5 million people. These figures were disputed in an April 2016 study published by Tom Kelly, Ph.D, a professor of Economics at Baylor University and the Director of Baylor University Center for Business and Economic Research, along with Bennet Hickok, an Economics student at Baylor. The Kelly/Hickok report argues that the attendance at the fair is about 1.5-1.7 million visitors a year, or about half of what state fair staff reported it to be. According to the 2017 State Fair of Texas Annual Report, the Fair attracted a total of 2,250,433 attendees during the 2017 event with roughly 93,000 daily guests.\n\nThe 2016 Kelly/Hickok study found that the State Fair generates around $50 million for the area economy. This is in contrast to the figure of $600 million in impact that the State Fair itself has traditionally reported.\n\nThe State Fair has a lease with Fair Park, the terms of which require that any profit or excess revenue it generates be spent \"for the development and enhancement of Fair Park and the Fair\". In May 2016, the State Fair released a list of capital projects for the past 10 years, detailing how the fair had spent their excess revenue. According to media reports, 90% of excess revenue was spent on projects that solely benefited the State Fair. A survey of Fair Park revealed out of the 277 acres available, 200 are covered in asphalt or concrete, compared to 10 acres of green space.\n\nIn 2014, Errol McKoy, the former President of the State Fair of Texas, received $1.425 million in compensation.\n\nOn May 13, 2016, the City of Dallas Auditor, Craig Kinton, released an audit regarding Fair Park Business Partners, which included the State Fair of Texas. The audit concluded the City of Dallas had no way to ensure the State Fair was adequately investing in Fair Park, per the terms of the contract between the City of Dallas and State Fair.\n\n\n"}

It was intended as a modern revival of the Tailteann Games held from legendary times until the Norman invasion of Ireland; as such it drew inspiration from the Modern Olympics revival of the Ancient Olympics. Croke Park, the Dublin headquarters of the Gaelic Athletic Association, was the venue for the opening ceremony and many of the sports events, which were open to people of Irish birth or ancestry. The Tailteann Games were held shortly after the Summer Olympics, such that athletes participating in Paris 1924 and Amsterdam 1928 came to compete. Participants coming from England, Scotland, Wales, Canada, the USA, South Africa and Australia as well as Ireland. Chess competitions were held in conjunction with the Irish Chess Union as part of the Tailteann Games. There were also artistic competitions and industrial displays. The games became regarded as a Cumann na nGaedheal project, and when that party lost power to Fianna Fáil after the 1932 election there was no financial backing for further games.\n\nThis revival \"meeting of the Irish race\" was announced by Éamon de Valera in Dáil Éireann in 1921. The 1922 Irish Race Convention supported the plan for an \"Irish Race Olympic\". However, due to the Anglo-Irish War and Civil War it was not held until 1924. The meeting was launched to celebrate the independence of Ireland. The Hogan Stand was built and opened for the 1924 games.\n\nA report to revive the games was debated in the Dáil in June 1922. Modern sports such as motorcycling and shooting were to be included, along with a parade of massed choirs. The possibility of out-doing the Olympic Games was mentioned: \"We have got representations from America to the effect that it would be advisable to depart from the idea of confining the Tailteann games to the Irish race and seeing that they predated the Greek Olympic by a thousand years we should be justified in entering upon a more varied programme.\" The games were delayed by the Irish Civil War of 1922–23.\n\nCommemorative medals were struck for all three games, in gold, silver, silver gilt, and bronze. They depict Tailtiu, the patron deity of the ancient Tailteann Games, with inscription \"An Bhainrioghan Tailte\" (\"Queen Tailte\").\n\nThe games opened with the \"Tailteann choir\" singing the \"Tailteann ode\", with words by Oliver St. John Gogarty and music by Louis O'Brien. The ode won Gogarty a bronze medal in the literature section of the 1924 Olympic art competition. The Irish flag was carried by Tom Kiely, winner of the 1904 Olympic all-around (decathlon) title.\n\nTo increase the quality of the competition, some Olympic stars without Irish heritage were invited to compete as guests.\n\nThe dissident Irish republican government which had lost the Civil War urged a boycott of the games \"falsely described as Aonach Tailteann\", because it rejected the legitimacy of the Free State government which sponsored the games. Rugby union was excluded from the program because the Irish Rugby Football Union was seen as \"undemocratic and almost un-Irish\".\n\nRun in conjunction with the Irish Chess Union, there were three competitions, the overall competition was won by the reigning Irish Champion Philip Baker, the Major Competition was won by Lord Dunsany, with Aaron Sayers as runner-up. Dublin Chess Club provided its premises and equipment for use for the Competitions.\n\nIn hurling, teams from England, Wales, the United States, Scotland, and Ireland played.\n\nA shinty–hurling match was played between Scotland team organised by the Camanachd Association and an Ireland team organised by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA).\n\nThe Camogie Association planned national and international camogie competitions, but withdrew after a dispute with the organisers, reflecting the anti-Free State bias of the association's leadership. An exhibition match was played without the association's sanction, while an association \"Ireland\" team played in London.\n\nSwimming events were held in the pond at Dublin Zoo. American Johnny Weissmuller and Australian Andrew \"Boy\" Charleton took part.\n\nThe American Harold Osborn, the 1924 Olympic high jump champion, won the same event in the Tailteann Games\n\nThe Sailing events of 1924 were sailed in Kingstown (now Dún Laoghaire) on Saturday in the second week of August.\n\nThe Motor Boat event of 1924 took place in Dublin Bay.\n\nW. B. Yeats persuaded the Royal Irish Academy to award prizes. The gold medal went to Stephen MacKenna for his translation of Plotinus; other winners were Oliver Gogarty, Francis Stuart, and James Stephens. A banquet presided over by T. M. Healy, the Governor-General of the Irish Free State, had an \"oddly assorted\" group of guests invited by Yeats, including Augustus John, Sir Edwin Lutyens, writers Compton Mackenzie, G. K. Chesterton, Lennox Robinson, and Carlos Magalhães de Azeredo; cricketers Ranjitsinhji and C. B. Fry; and diplomats Willem Hubert Nolens and Erik Palmstierna. Chesterton accepted the medal on his behalf of the absent MacKenna, who later refused it.\n\nAn art and craft exhibition at the Royal Hibernian Academy displayed 1,597 works, more than half entered for competition in 32 categories. The overall \"Tailteann Trophy\" went to Seán Keating's \"Homage to Hugh Lane\". Other gold medallists included Margaret Clarke, Francis Doyle Jones, Letitia Hamilton, Power O'Malley, and Patrick Tuohy.\n\nAt the Theatre Royal two recent operas by Irish composers were performed: Geoffrey Molyneux Palmer's \"Sruth na Maoile\" (1922) and Harold White's \"Seán the Post\" (1924), along with \"Shamus O'Brien\" (1896) by Charles V. Stanford. The last was not successful: \"there seemed to be a greater number of people in the orchestra than in the audience\".\n\nIn the genre painting competition, Charles Lamb won a silver medal for \"Dancing at a Northern Crossroads\", depicting a traditional crossroads dance.\n\nThe programme for the 1928 games included athletics, billiards, boxing, camogie, chess, cycling, Gaelic football, golf, gymnastics, Gaelic handball, hurling, motorcycling, rowing, and swimming.\n\nAt the awards ceremony in the Iveagh Gardens, the pageant \"The Coming of Fionn\" by Seamus MacCall was staged.\n\nThe 1928 Games was won by John O'Hanlon a multiple Irish Champion.\n\nThe Motor Boat event of 1928 took place at Ballyglass, Co. Westmeath, home of the Lough Ree Yacht Club, and Motor Yacht Club of Ireland, on 16 August. Races took place in various classes:\n\nWith the 1932 Summer Olympics begin held in Los Angeles, the Tailteann Games was originally scheduled for 1931 to avoid a clash, but postponed to 1932, which meant Olympic athletes from Ireland or abroad could not be present. The Games' main backer, minister J. J. Walsh, lost office when Fianna Fáil took power after the 1932 election, and public funding was cut. Against a background of the Great Depression and the Anglo-Irish Trade War, the Games cut from two weeks to one; they made a £12 profit.\n\nThe third games was won again by John O'Hanlon who was also Irish Champion in 1932.\n\nThe sailing events were hosted by the National Yacht Club, Dun Laoghaire in July 1932.\nIn 1937 Éamon de Valera organised an inter-departmental committee into the feasibility of staging another games, which reported in June that it would be possible to stage one in 1939. De Valera used the split in Irish athletics governance as an excuse to defer consideration, to the chagrin of J. J. Walsh. The onset of the Second World War deferred any progress and nothing further happened after the war.\n\n\n"}

The participants in this match were Heavy Metal, Sangre Chicana, El Oriental, Electroshock, May Flowers and El Brazo.\n\nIn early 1992 Antonio Peña was working as a booker and storyline writer for Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL), Mexico's largest and the world's oldest wrestling promotion, and was frustrated by CMLL's very conservative approach to \"lucha libre\". He joined forced with a number of younger, very talented wrestlers who felt like CMLL was not giving them the recognition they deserved and decided to split from CMLL to create Asistencia Asesoría y Administración, later known simply as \"AAA\" or Triple A. After making a deal with the \"Televisa\" television network AAA held their first show in April 1992. The following year Peña and AAA held their first Triplemanía event, building it into an annual event that would become AAA's Super Bowl event, similar to the WWE's WrestleMania being the biggest show of the year. The 2002 Triplemanía was the 10th year in a row AAA held a Triplemanía show and the fifteenth overall show under the Triplemanía banner.\n\nThe Triplemanía show featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "415946", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=415946", "title": "USS Pueblo (AGER-2)", "text": "USS Pueblo (AGER-2)\n\nUSS \"Pueblo\" (AGER-2) is a , attached to Navy intelligence as a spy ship, which was attacked and captured by North Korean forces on 23 January 1968, in what is known today as the \"Pueblo\" incident\" or alternatively, as the \"Pueblo\" crisis\".\n\nThe seizure of the U.S. Navy ship and her 83 crew members, one of whom was killed in the attack, came less than a week after President Lyndon B. Johnson's State of the Union address to the United States Congress, a week before the start of the Tet Offensive in South Vietnam during the Vietnam War, and three days after 31 men of North Korea's KPA Unit 124 had crossed the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and killed 26 South Koreans in an attempt to attack the South Korean Blue House (executive mansion) in the capital Seoul. The taking of \"Pueblo\" and the abuse and torture of her crew during the subsequent 11-month prisoner drama became a major Cold War incident, raising tensions between the western powers, and the Soviet Union and China.\n\nNorth Korea stated that \"Pueblo\" deliberately entered their territorial waters away from Ryo Island, and that the logbook shows that they intruded several times. However, the United States maintains that the vessel was in international waters at the time of the incident and that any purported evidence supplied by North Korea to support its statements was fabricated.\n\n\"Pueblo\", still held by North Korea today, officially remains a commissioned vessel of the United States Navy. Since early 2013, the ship has been moored along the Potong River in Pyongyang, and used there as a museum ship at the Pyongyang Victorious War Museum. \"Pueblo\" is the only ship of the U.S. Navy still on the commissioned roster currently being held captive.\n\nThe ship was launched at the Kewaunee Shipbuilding and Engineering Company in Kewaunee, Wisconsin, on 16 April 1944, as the United States Army Freight and Passenger (FP) \"FP-344\". The Army later redesignated the FP vessels as Freight and Supply changing the designation to \"FS-344\". The ship, commissioned at New Orleans on 7 April 1945, served as a Coast Guard–manned Army vessel used for training civilians for the Army. Her first commanding officer was Lt. J. R. Choate, USCGR, succeeded by Lt. J.G. Marvin B. Barker, USCGR, on 12 September 1945. \"FS-344\" was placed out of service in 1954.\n\n\"FS-344\" was transferred to the United States Navy on 12 April 1966 and was renamed USS \"Pueblo\" (AKL-44) after Pueblo and Pueblo County, Colorado on 18 June of the same year.\n\nInitially, she served as a light cargo ship, but shortly after resuming service was converted to an intelligence gathering ship, or what is colloquially known as a \"spy ship\", and redesignated \"AGER-2\" on 13 May 1967. \n\nOn 5 January 1968, \"Pueblo\" left U.S. Navy base Yokosuka, Japan, in transit to the U.S. naval base at Sasebo, Japan; from there she left on 11 January 1968, headed northward through the Tsushima Strait into the Sea of Japan. She left with specific orders to intercept and conduct surveillance of Soviet Navy activity in the Tsushima Strait and to gather signal and electronic intelligence from North Korea. The declassified SIGAD for the National Security Agency (NSA) Direct Support Unit (DSU) from the Naval Security Group (NSG) on \"Pueblo\" during the patrol involved in the incident was USN-467Y. AGER (Auxiliary General Environmental Research) denoted a joint Naval and National Security Agency (NSA) program.\n\nAt 17:30 on 20 January 1968, a North Korean modified SO-1 class Soviet style submarine chaser passed within of \"Pueblo\", which was about southeast of Mayang-do at a position 39°47'N and 128°28.5'E.\n\nIn the afternoon of 22 January 1968, the two North Korean fishing trawlers \"Rice Paddy 1\" and \"Rice Paddy 2\" passed within of \"Pueblo\". That day, a North Korean unit made an assassination attempt in the \"Blue House\" executive mansion against the South Korean President Park Chung-hee, but the crew of \"Pueblo\" were not informed.\n\nAccording to the American account, the following day, 23 January, \"Pueblo\" was approached by a submarine chaser and her nationality was challenged; \"Pueblo\" responded by raising the U.S. flag. The North Korean vessel then ordered \"Pueblo\" to stand down or be fired upon. \"Pueblo\" attempted to maneuver away, but was considerably slower than the submarine chaser. Several warning shots were fired. Additionally, three torpedo boats appeared on the horizon and then joined in the chase and subsequent attack.\n\nThe attackers were soon joined by two MiG-21 fighters. A fourth torpedo boat and a second submarine chaser appeared on the horizon a short time later. The ammunition on \"Pueblo\" was stored belowdecks, and her machine guns were wrapped in cold weather tarpaulins. The machine guns were unmanned, and no attempt was made to man them. An NSA report quotes the sailing order:\n\nand notes\n\nU.S. Navy authorities and the crew of \"Pueblo\" insist that before the capture, \"Pueblo\" was miles outside North Korean territorial waters. North Korea says the vessel was well within North Korean territory. The mission statement allowed her to approach within a nautical mile (1,852 m) of that limit. North Korea, however, describes a sea boundary even though international standards were at the time.\n\nThe North Korean vessels attempted to board \"Pueblo\", but she was maneuvered to prevent this for over two hours. A submarine chaser then opened fire with a 57 mm cannon, killing one member of the crew. The smaller vessels fired machine guns into \"Pueblo\", which then signaled compliance and began destroying sensitive material. The volume of material on board was so great that it was impossible to destroy it all. An NSA report quotes Lieutenant Steve Harris, the officer in charge of \"Pueblo\"s Naval Security Group Command detachment:\n\nand concludes\n\nRadio contact between \"Pueblo\" and the Naval Security Group in Kamiseya, Japan, had been ongoing during the incident. As a result, Seventh Fleet command was fully aware of \"Pueblo\"s situation. Air cover was promised but never arrived. The Fifth Air Force had no aircraft on strip alert, and estimated a two to three-hour delay in launching aircraft. was located south of \"Pueblo\", yet her four F-4B aircraft on alert were not equipped for an air-to-surface engagement. \"Enterprise\"s captain estimated that 1.5 hours (90 minutes) were required to get the converted aircraft into the air.\n\n\"Pueblo\" followed the North Korean vessels as ordered, but then stopped immediately outside North Korean waters. She was again fired upon, and a sailor, fireman Duane Hodges, was killed. The ship was finally boarded at 05:55 UTC (2:55 pm local) by men from a torpedo boat and a submarine chaser. Crew members had their hands tied and were blindfolded, beaten, and prodded with bayonets. Once \"Pueblo\" was in North Korean territorial waters, she was boarded again, this time by high-ranking North Korean officials.\n\nThe first official confirmation that the ship was in North Korean hands came five days later, 28 January 1968. Two days earlier a flight by a CIA A-12 Oxcart aircraft from the Project Black Shield squadron at Kadena, Okinawa flown by pilot Ronald Layton made three high altitude high speed flights over North Korea. When the aircraft's films were processed in the United States they showed \"Pueblo\" to be in the Wonsan harbor area surrounded by two North Korean vessels.\n\nThere was dissent among government officials in the United States, regarding how to handle the situation. Congressman Mendel Rivers suggested that President Johnson issue an ultimatum for the return of \"Pueblo\" on penalty of nuclear attack, while Senator Gale McGee said the United States should wait for more information and not make \"spasmodic response[s] to aggravating incidents\". According to Horace Busby, Special Assistant to President Johnson, the president's \"reaction to the hostage taking was to work very hard here to keep down any demands for retaliation or any other attacks upon North Koreans\", worried that rhetoric might result in the hostages being killed.\n\nThe day following the incident on Wednesday 24 January 1968, following extensive cabinet meetings Washington decided upon that their initial response should be to:\n\na) Deploy air and naval forces to the immediate area.\n\nb) Make reconnaissance flights over the location of the Pueblo.\n\nc) Call up military reserves and extending terms of military service.\n\nd) Protest the incident within framework of the United Nations\n\ne) President Johnson should personally cable Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin.\n\nThe Johnson administration also considered a blockade of North Korean ports, air strikes on military targets, and \nan attack across the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas.\n\nAlthough American officials at the time assumed the seizure of \"Pueblo\" had been directed by the Soviet Union, it has emerged in recent years that North Korea acted alone and the incident actually harmed North Korea's relations with most of the Eastern Bloc.\n\n\"Pueblo\" was taken into port at Wonsan and the crew was moved twice to prisoner of war (POW) camps. The crew reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment turned worse when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them \"the finger\" in staged propaganda photos.\n\nCommander Lloyd M. Bucher was psychologically tortured, such as being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually the North Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to \"confess to his and the crew's transgression.\" Bucher wrote the confession since a \"confession\" by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said \"We paean the DPRK [North Korea]. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung\". (Bucher pronounced \"\"paean\" as \"pee on\".\")\n\nNegotiations for the release of the crew took place at Panmunjom. At the same time, U.S. officials were concerned with conciliating the South Koreans, who expressed discontent about being left out of the negotiations. Richard A. Ericson, a political counselor for the American embassy in Seoul and operating officer for the \"Pueblo\" negotiations, notes in his oral history:\n\nThe South Koreans were absolutely furious and suspicious of what we might do. They anticipated that the North Koreans would try to exploit the situation to the ROK's disadvantage in every way possible, and they were rapidly growing distrustful of us and losing faith in their great ally. Of course, we had this other problem of how to ensure that the ROK would not retaliate for the Blue House Raid and to ease their growing feelings of insecurity. They began to realize that the DMZ was porous and they wanted more equipment and aid. So, we were juggling a number of problems.\n\nHe also noted how the meetings at Panmunjom were usually unproductive, due to the particular negotiating style of the North Koreans:\n\nAs one example, we would go up with a proposal of some sort on the release of the crew and they would be sitting there with a card catalog ... If the answer to the particular proposal we presented wasn't in the cards, they would say something that was totally unresponsive and then go off and come back to the next meeting with an answer that was directed to the question. But there was rarely an immediate answer. That happened all through the negotiations. Their negotiators obviously were never empowered to act or speak on the basis of personal judgment or general instructions. They always had to defer a reply and presumably they went over it up in Pyongyang and passed it around and then decided on it. Sometimes we would get totally nonsensical responses if they didn't have something in the card file that corresponded to the proposal at hand.\nEricson and George Newman, the Deputy Chief of Mission in Seoul, wrote a telegram for the State Department in February 1968, predicting how the negotiations would play out:\n\nWhat we said in effect was this: If you are going to do this thing at Panmunjom, and if your sole objective is to get the crew back, you will be playing into North Korea's hands and the negotiations will follow a clear and inevitable path. You are going to be asked to sign a document that the North Koreans will have drafted. They will brook no changes. It will set forth their point of view and require you to confess to everything they accuse you of ... If you allow them to, they will take as much time as they feel they need to squeeze every damn thing they can get out of this situation in terms of their propaganda goals, and they will try to exploit this situation to drive a wedge between the U.S. and the ROK. Then when they feel they have accomplished all they can, and when we have agreed to sign their document of confession and apology, they will return the crew. They will not return the ship. This is the way it is going to be because this is the way it has always been.\n\nFollowing an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that \"Pueblo\" had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members, although the written apology was preceded by an oral statement that it was done only to secure the release. On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and ordered to walk south one by one across the \"Bridge of No Return\". Exactly eleven months after being taken prisoner, the Captain led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge. The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature which read: \"and this hereby receipts for eighty two crewmen and one corpse\".\n\nBucher and all the officers and crew subsequently appeared before a Navy Court of Inquiry. A court-martial was recommended for Bucher and the Officer in Charge of the Research Department, Lieutenant Steve Harris for surrendering without a fight and for failing to destroy classified material, but the Secretary of the Navy, John Chafee, rejected the recommendation, stating, \"They have suffered enough.\" Commander Bucher was never found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement.\n\nIn 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS \"Pueblo\" incident entitled \"Bucher: My Story\". Bucher died in San Diego on 28 January 2004, at the age of 76. James Kell, a former sailor under his command, suggested that the injuries suffered by Bucher during his time in North Korea contributed to his death.\n\nUSS \"Pueblo\" is still held by North Korea. In October 1999, she was towed from Wonsan on the east coast, around the Korean Peninsula, to the port of Nampo on the west coast. This required moving the vessel through international waters, and was undertaken just before the visit of U.S. presidential envoy James Kelly to the capital Pyongyang. After the stop at the Nampo shipyard \"Pueblo\" was relocated to Pyongyang and moored on the Taedong River near the spot that the General Sherman incident is believed to have taken place. In late 2012 \"Pueblo\" was moved again to the Botong River in Pyongyang next to a new addition to the Fatherland Liberation War Museum.\n\nToday, \"Pueblo\" remains the second-oldest commissioned ship in the U.S. Navy, behind (\"Old Ironsides\"). \"Pueblo\" is one of only a few American ships to have been captured since the wars in Tripoli.\n\nReverse engineering of communications devices on \"Pueblo\" allowed the North Koreans to share knowledge with the Soviet Union that led to the replication of those communications devices. This allowed the two nations access to the US Navy's communication systems until the late 1980s when the US Navy revised those systems. The seizure of \"Pueblo\" followed soon after US Navy warrant officer John Anthony Walker introduced himself to Soviet authorities, setting up the Walker spy ring. It has been argued that the seizure of \"Pueblo\" was executed specifically to capture the encryption devices aboard. Without them, it was difficult for the Soviets to make full use of Walker's information.\n\nDocuments released from National Archives of Romania suggest it was the Chinese rather than the Soviets who actively encouraged the reopening of hostilities in Korea during 1968, promising North Korea vast material support should hostilities in Korea resume. Together with Blue House Raid, the \"Pueblo\" incident turned out to be part of an increasing divergence between the Soviet leadership and North Korea. Fostering a resumption of hostilities in Korea, allegedly, was seen in Beijing as a way to mend relations between North Korea and China, and pull North Korea back in the Chinese sphere of influence in the context of the Sino-Soviet split. After the (then secret) diplomatic efforts of the Soviets to have the American crew released fell on deaf ears in Pyongyang, Leonid Brezhnev publicly denounced North Korea's actions at the 8th plenary session of the 23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In contrast, the Chinese (state controlled) press published declarations supportive of North Korea's actions in the \"Pueblo\" incident.\n\nFurthermore, Soviet archives reveal that the Soviet leadership was particularly displeased that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung had contradicted the assurances he previously gave Moscow that he would avoid a military escalation in Korea. Previously secret documents suggest the Soviets were surprised by the \"Pueblo\" incident, first learning of it in the press. The same documents reveal that the North Koreans also kept the Soviets completely in the dark regarding ongoing negotiations with the Americans for the crew's release, which was another bone of contention. The Soviet reluctance at a reopening of hostilities in Korea was partly motivated by the fact that they had a 1961 treaty with North Korea that obliged them to intervene in case the latter got attacked. Brezhnev however had made it clear in 1966 that just as in the case of the similar treaty they had with China, the Soviets were prepared to ignore it rather than go to all-out war with the United States.\n\nGiven that Chinese and North Korean archives surrounding the incident remain secret, Kim Il-sung's intentions cannot be known with certainty. The Soviets revealed however that Kim Il-sung sent a letter to Alexei Kosygin on 31 January 1968 demanding further military and economic aid, which was interpreted by the Soviets as the price they would have to pay to restrain Kim Il-sung's bellicosity. Consequently, Kim Il-sung was personally invited to Moscow, but he refused to go in person owing to \"increased defense preparations\" he had to personally attend to, sending instead his defense minister, Kim Ch'ang-bong, who arrived on 26 February 1968. During a long meeting with Brezhnev, the Soviet leader made it clear that they were not willing to go to war with the United States, but agreed to an increase in subsidies for North Korea, which did happen in subsequent years.\n\nWith Major General Pak Chung-kuk representing North Korea (DPRK) and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral John Victor Smith representing the United States until April 1968, at which point he is replaced by U.S. Army Major General Gilbert H. Woodward. Timeline and quotations are taken from \"Matter of Accountability\" by Trevor Armbrister.\n\"Pueblo\" is a tourist attraction in Pyongyang, North Korea, since being moved to the Taedong River. \"Pueblo\" used to be anchored at the spot where it is believed the \"General Sherman\" incident took place in 1866. In late November 2012 \"Pueblo\" was moved from the Taedong river dock to a casement on the Botong river next to the new Fatherland War of Liberation Museum. The ship was renovated and made open to tourists with an accompanying video. of the North Korean perspective in late July 2013. To commemorate the anniversary of the Korean War, the ship had a new layer of paint added. Visitors are allowed to board the ship and see its secret code room and crew artifacts.\n\nThe museum's position is 39°02.26 N 125°44.23 E\n\nDuring an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Donald Gregg received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate \"Pueblo\" to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, there has been no indication that the matter was brought up by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on his April 2018 visit.\n\nFormer \"Pueblo\" crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge Henry H.

The composer has said that \"it tells the remarkable story of this woman who lived with four men – it was a story about the history of music, the history of England, about sex, and the difference between the old culture of sex and the new one, and how it all came together in the life of this peculiar woman\". The two-act opera was given the first of two performances on 30 November 2005 at Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, directed by Tess Gibbs and conducted by Clive Timms.\n\nScruton is better known as a writer and philosopher, and is largely self-taught as a composer. \"Violet\" is the second of Scruton's two operas – it was preceded by the one-act \"The Minister\" (1998). According to The Times' critic Hilary Finch, Scruton's first opera was influenced by Benjamin Britten, whereas according to a review by David Conway, \"Violet\" is influenced by Janáček, a composer Scruton is known to admire. The score includes a number of references to music of other composers (including Bach, Mozart and Wagner), as well as to folksong.\n\nThe opera is based on the life of the harpsichordist Violet Gordon-Woodhouse, who is described in Grove Music Online as follows: \"A woman of wealth and social standing (somewhat imperilled by her irregular private life), she did not lead a very active public professional life, but made a considerable impression on the intellectual and artistic circles of the day\". The composer has written \"In Violet’s world high culture, eccentric life-style, and aristocratic manners achieved a never-to-be-repeated synthesis. And when that world was swept away by the First World War, a part of the English soul was lost\". According to the programme note of the premiere performance, \"Violet\" epitomises \"the sad magnificence of human folly\".\n\nThe cast of the opera includes Violet, her husband Gordon (with whom she had a \"mariage blanc\") and a circle of relatives and friends including the lesbian composer Ethel Smyth (whose role is sung by a baritone) and three of Violet's male admirers.\n\nThe opera is set in the Gloucestershire home of the Woodhouses, Nether Lypiatt Manor. Jessica (in the present day), reading her great-aunt's papers, recreates the Edwardian world of Violet and her 'husbands' – Gordon, Max Labouchere, Bill Barrington (later 10th Viscount Barrington), Dennis Tollemache and Ethel. The characters extol Violet and dine together. In the second act we learn that Max has died in the trenches in World War I. \n\nThe \"ménage\" appears not to have been sexless, but acording to the composer/librettist, Violet had a dream in which \"love means purity and passion stops at the garden gate\". \nJessica, mourning what she sees as the loss of an innocent world, decides to sell the house.\n\nNotes\nSources\n"}

{"id": "3612945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3612945", "title": "World Naked Bike Ride", "text": "World Naked Bike Ride\n\nThe World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) is an international clothing-optional bike ride in which participants plan, meet and ride together \"en masse\" on human-powered transport (the vast majority on bicycles, but some on skateboards and inline skates), to \"deliver a vision of a cleaner, safer, body-positive world.\"\n\nThe dress code motto is \"bare as you dare\". Full or partial nudity is encouraged, but not mandatory. There is no mandate to cover intimate parts; this is a distinguishing feature of the WNBR against other cycling events.\n\nCreative expression is also encouraged to generate a fun and immersive atmosphere during the ride, capture the attention and imagination of the public and media, and make the experience more personalized and fulfilling for the riders. Body art, such as body painting, are common forms of creative expression, as well as costumes, art bikes, portable sound reinforcement systems (such as public address systems, bullhorns and boomboxes) and musical instruments or other types of noisemaker.\n\nPre- and post-ride parties for WNBRs have become events unto themselves, often featuring musical bands, DJs, body painting, temporary structures/installation art, political tabling, and catering. In addition to simply being able to ride clothes-free on community streets, some rides have established precedent by having body-painting parties, often involving numbers of naked riders and artists in high-visibility municipal parks.\n\nThis distinctive form of Critical Mass, occasionally called \"Critical Ass\" in a WNBR context, is often described or categorised as a form of political protest, street theatre, party-on-wheels, streaking, public nudity and clothing-optional recreation, and thus attracts a wide range of participants.\n\nIn 2003 Conrad Schmidt conceived the World Naked Bike Ride after organising the Naked Bike Rides of the group Artists for Peace/Artists Against War (AFP/AAW) which had taken place in Vancouver, Canada starting in 2002; this and other high-profile political and media events led to the creation of the Work Less Party of British Columbia.\n\nWNBR rapidly started to come to life through collaborations with activist groups and individuals around the world. The first WNBR event in 2004 was a collaboration between the WNBR group riding on 12 June and \"Manifestación Ciclonudista\" in Spain riding on 19 June, establishing a precedent as a solstitial Saturday observance. Since that time rides have also taken place in February and March (mainly in the Southern Hemisphere). A smaller number of rides have taken place at other times of the year. Before June 2004, two independent organizations — AFP/AAW and \"Manifestación Ciclonudista\" — had been organising very similar political events with virtually identical messages of protesting oil dependency. Despite having similar political messages neither of these groups knew of the existence of the other until collaboration began many months before the first WNBR event.\n\nInitially the message of the WNBR was protesting against oil dependency and celebrating the power and individuality of the human body. In 2006, there was a shift towards simplifying the message and focusing on cycling advocacy. While the ride does include and appeal to participants from social nudity circles, the ride is not focused on promoting social nudity directly as much as cycling.\n\nThe 2004 WNBR saw events in 28 cities, in ten countries on four continents. By 2010, WNBR had expanded to stage rides in 74 cities, in 17 countries, from the United States to the United Kingdom and Hungary to Paraguay.\n\nPrior to the World Naked Bike ride in 2004 there were many organizations organizing naked bike rides. In Germany naked bike rides were regularly organized by FKK organizations (Freikörperkultur). In Seattle naked bike rides were organized by the Fremont riders. In Spain rides were organized by the Ciclonudista. In Canada naked rides were regularly organized by Artists Against War.\n\nOpposition to large Critical Mass-type events may argue that they induce traffic congestion. To counter, supporters may suggest: \"We are not \"stopping\" traffic, we \"are\" traffic.\" Critical Mass and other \"biketivist\" groups promote awareness of cyclists; many cyclists are seriously injured or killed on the highways. Participants advocate \"living streets\" and bicycle-friendly communities.\n\nParticipants believe that many communities were not designed to take advantage of bicycles, which can be considered the most efficient means of personal transport. Instead, they believe, society has subordinated community values to the requirements of expensive, dangerous, loud and polluting vehicles. Oil has become a treasured commodity — associated by some with the costs of war and climate change.\n\nLike Critical Mass, WNBR aims to promote bicycle transportation, renewable energy, recreation, walkable communities, and environmentally responsible, sustainable solutions to living in the 21st century. Participants celebrate the many benefits of a car-free lifestyle: reduced emissions, free parking, and overall a greater feeling of freedom.\n\nSome cycling activists have criticised WNBR for trivialising the issues of oil dependency, cyclists' access to roads, and car culture. Organisers may counter that the concepts of having fun and public outreach are not mutually exclusive. Creative advocacy stimulates people to contemplate the issues. They argue that by occupying lanes intended for cars and not for bicycles, by tossing their clothes and rejecting body shame, they are protesting a way of life which should be abandoned.\n\nThe ride has been criticized by some because WNBR largely involves participants who are naked or topfree. Some who are offended by nudity or topfreedom believe that it should take place in designated areas or times only, and that WNBR participants seek to engage in exhibitionism or even express sexually deviant intent.\n\nParticipants claim that non-sexualized, colorful and creative nakedness in repressed societies is a refreshing way to remind people of some fundamental freedoms of life that people have collectively handed over without really thinking of the consequences. They claim that the WNBR is about body-positive values: living a healthy life in tune with, not against, the environment; respecting the natural beauty and diversity of human bodies; establishing and projecting a positive self-image; and rejecting shame. Organizers feel that WNBR is not just a ride against oil dependency; it is a ride for self-empowerment.\n\nThe policing of the ride varies according to local laws, local police policy, and local cultural expectations. At some events, police support and facilitate the event. Police have provided traffic control at road junctions for the London (until 2009), Brighton, Vancouver, Portland, Philadelphia, Helsinki, and Brussels rides. At other events police take a more neutral stance, simply monitoring proceedings. In other cases, such as in Ottawa, police have attempted to stop the ride or have attempted to encourage riders to wear some level of clothing.\n\nArrests during WNBR events are rare. Two male riders were arrested during the 2005 WNBR in North Conway, New Hampshire, and charged with \"indecent exposure and lewdness\". The two riders agreed to having the charges reduced to \"disorderly conduct\" and paid a $300 fine, the majority of which was paid for by the WNBR Legal Defense Fund. Six male riders were charged with public indecency during the 2005 WNBR Chicago ride and later prosecuted with sentences ranging from fines and non-expungeable conviction to three months of court supervision. In 2007 during the first World Naked Bike ride in Denver, Colorado police surrounded the bike riders and wrote several people tickets. During the WNBR held on June 12, 2010, two males were arrested by campus police at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington. Two riders were arrested in New York City in 2014 for \"lewdness and indecent exposure\".\n\nThe majority of WNBR events have encountered few cultural and legal problems.\n\nLaws on nudity are often vague and difficult to enforce. As WNBR is clothing-optional, organizers urge those who are uncomfortable going naked or who fear legal scuffles simply not to go fully nude. Participants have used body paint, liquid latex, strategically placed items, underwear and duct tape to cover intimate parts. For example, flesh-colored bodysuits with exaggerated body parts were used in Seattle in 1999 by Fremont Arts Council members to spoof the Solstice Cyclists in the Summer Solstice Parade. Organizers encourage creativity and imagination, whether the participants go fully nude or not.\n\nSome cities have restrictions on nudity in public areas, and some cultures have harsh restrictions on public nudity. However, the laws of most progressive societies are written to discourage activities which are intended to shock or offend. Many laws on nudity hinge on a concept of indecent exposure. Participants may argue that there is nothing indecent about the naked human body and counter that the only thing that is indecent are laws on nudity.\n\nSimon Oosterman, the organizer of the 2005 WNBR in Auckland, and the first to be arrested during a WNBR event, is credited with going further and refocusing the issue on oil-dependency. He urged: \"Stop the indecent exposure to vehicle emissions.\" Oosterman later defended against a charge of indecent exposure in the Auckland district court in 2006; after hearing evidence, the judge dismissed the charge.\n\nRiders are encouraged to \"ride loud and be proud\". Organizers only allow rides to be organized in public areas for maximum outreach, not in established or ghettoized areas. Events are promoted at the grassroots level, often using Internet resources such as discussion groups, web sites, blogs and online journals and also by placing advertisements in local, non-mainstream newspapers and progressive journals.\n\n\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\nOfficial\nVideos and images\n\nNews\n"}
