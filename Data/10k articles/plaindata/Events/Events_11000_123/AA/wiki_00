The scale of these Games exceeds even the two Asian Games held in Delhi in 1951 (both by athletes' volume and by number of participating nations) and 1982 (by number of participating nations). More than 2000 athletes from 96 countries competed in the Games. A total of 131 sporting events in eight disciplines were conducted. Also, 120 countries sent 1,565 official representatives to these Games.\n\nThe First Afro-Asian Games were held after nearly two decades of delays, shifts and cancellations. The prolonged amount of time for these Games considerably reduced interest in them. After the preliminary decision of hosting the Games, the venue was shuttled between New Delhi and Kuwait City. At the last moment, New Delhi was out favoured by Hyderabad, which had hosted the National Games of India in 2002.\n\nThese Games, however, had lesser scope than the Asian Games or Commonwealth Games, since 96 nations participated in only eight disciplines. The Games witnessed only one new world record. Thirty-seven countries - an unprecedented 39% of the participating nations - won at least one medal in these Games.\n\nThe idea to hold an inter-continental sporting event between Asia and Africa was initiated in April 1983, with New Delhi as the proposed venue. However, for unknown circumstances, the venue was shifted to Kuwait and the Games were proposed to be held in 1985. Political instability led to the cancellation of the Games. In 1989, the proposal was reconsidered, with New Delhi again chosen as the venue for the Games. The Games were then scheduled for 1991. The plans went wrong due to inefficient communication between the members, and so could not come into force.\n\nIn 1999, a proposal for the renewal of the Games was accepted. Subsequently, Pune and then New Delhi were proposed as venues. However, they were postponed till November 2001. Slow preparations led to indefinite postponement again. After the occurrence of 9/11, Delhi pulled out. This led to the circulation of rumours that the games were \"jinxed\". Later, the IOA announced that the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa (ANOCA) had sanctioned 2003 as the new date for the Games. Also, the venue was changed to Hyderabad after Delhi pulled out. Most critics point to the successful hosting of the 32nd National Games of India, which were held at Hyderabad, as the main reason for Hyderabad being chosen.\n\nThe Indian Government spent 1.03 billion (US$22.92 million), for the Afro-Asian Games, making these Games one of the most expensive sporting events held in Hyderabad. All preparations were completed within 60 days before the events began.\n\nThe Indian Olympic Association (IOA) decided to set up a central head of the development for the Games. Thus, the Afro-Asian Games Secretariat was set up at the \"Greenlands Guest House\" to organize, monitor and manage all the activities related to the Games. 17 functional organizing sub-committees were formed to oversee the development of the venues and other infrastructure. The various functions were divided within these committees. The special officer-in-charge of the Games was Sabyasachi Ghosh, while the Secretary-General of the Games was Ali Moradi.\n\nA large development Planning Association meant a great amount of inter-connectivity and communication requirements. A 24-hour call centre with interpreters was set up, using a Closed User Group (CUG) circuit.\n\nA large \"web\" of networking facilities was built to connect all the hotels, media centres, stadia and Transportation Committees. This would help in easing pressure on any one committee. Since the African continent is not very well-connected, an Accreditation Committee was dispatched to Abuja - in Nigeria - the host city of the 2003 All-Africa Games. The Accreditation committee brought all sports-persons and officials from Africa to Hyderabad.\n\nThe software company CMC Limited had developed a Games and Event Management System (GEMS), which helped the organizers to efficiently manage events across the sports venues. It worked closely with Doordarshan, the official television broadcasters of the Games, to provide results of sporting competitions and live Games information. Additionally, cutting-edge technology like the implementation of geo-referenced maps and Geographic Information System (GIS) was implemented, so as to ensure a smooth and rapid flow of work.\n\nIn the month of September, less than a month away from the Afro-Asian Games, the Transport Ministry of Hyderabad released a large number of luxury vehicles, to be used in the Games. It was the second time in the span of one year that the Transport Ministry had done so - the first time being for the 32nd National Games of India. In an effort to spruce up the city in time for the Games, the organizers arranged several buses, vans and cars to ferry the athletes and the guests.\n\nAccommodation of the athletes and foreign officials posed a serious problem to the organisers. Contrary to what the Olympics and related multi-sport events provide, no actual Games Village was available for the athletes to stay. The Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) had initially wanted to have a separate Games Village for the Games, but could not arrange for it. Even though Hyderabad had hosted the 32nd National Games of India in 2002, for which a Games Village had been built, the organizers could not utilise it due to severe financial problems. It was estimated that about 800 million (US$16 million) would be required to upgrade the existing Games Village. The Government of Andhra Pradesh and the Sports Authority of Andhra Pradesh (SAAP) instead opted to obtain bulk bookings from all the major hotels in the city so as to provide accommodation for the athletes, foreign dignitaries and the media.\n\nAbout 1400 police personnel were drawn from various districts of Andhra Pradesh to provide the first layer of security. In addition to this, over 5000 city policemen were deployed in various places, including the event venues and all the major hotels of the city. Strict anti-sabotage measures were taken to provide security at the athlete hotels. Also, a 24-hour access control system was placed, with sniffer dogs used to sanitise the area.\n\nTo facilitate foreign athletes and officials, four immigration counters were set up at the airport. A time limit of 30 minutes was laid down to clear any athlete or official. To improve security speed, six interpreters of Russian, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean, French and Arabic were present at the airport. In addition, 24 specially trained immigration personnel were stationed round the clock in the airport.\n\nThere was a lot of pressure upon the Secretariat for the smooth performance of these Games, as the IOA would keenly observe the Afro-Asian Games, in preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games at Delhi, India. Also, officials from Beijing, China - the venue of 2008 Summer Olympics - and Doha, Qatar - the host of 2006 Asian Games - would attend the Afro-Asian Games, and keenly observe the way the Games functioned.\n\nHowever, hosting of the Games was not the only major issue for the Committee. The Afro-Asian Games would see the participation of various nations which are not in good terms with some other nations. The then Prime Minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee, had hinted that \"some nations might withdraw from the Games, rather than get embroiled in international conflicts\".\n\n\nThe logo of the Afro-Asian Games was the Charminar - Hyderabad's most famous landmark - surrounded by a string of pearls. Hyderabad is also famous for its pearls. The official logo of the Games was unveiled, along with the official website, by Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on September 3, 2003.\n\n\nThe Mascot for these Games was \"Sheroo\", also spelt \"Sheru\", a cartoon lion. Subsequently, a variation of the name 'Sheroo', called 'Shera', would be given for the mascot of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.\n\n\nSeveral Indian corporates such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), GVK Group and State Bank of Hyderabad provided sponsorships worth INR 10 million each towards the staging of several events of the inaugural Games. Several other corporates such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Videocon and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) also contributed to the Games. Also, Florida-based IMG Academy assisted in the conduct of the Games.\n\nThe First Afro-Asian Games were the first time that Asia and Africa came together for such a large event. 43 Asian countries and 53 African countries participated in this sporting event.\n\nBelow is a list of all the participating countries in the Inaugural Afro-Asian Games.\n\nThe events of the Games were held across eight stadiums, spread throughout the suburb of Gachibowli. The venues were:\n\nThe program of the Afro-Asian Games was almost the same as that of the Asian Games, the only difference being in the number of sports. These Games witnessed eight disciplines in eight sports. Synchronised swimming and diving were not contested.\n\nThe list of sports is given below \"(Number in parentheses indicates number of events)\".\n\n\nThe 2003 Afro-Asian Games Calendar is given below.\n\nQualification for the Games depended upon the performance of the countries in other major multi-sport events. Since these Games featured delegations from two continents, the qualification criteria for nations from the different continents was different. The qualification of the African nations was based on their performance in the 2003 All-Africa Games held in Abuja, Nigeria. The qualification for the Asian nations was based on their performance in the 2002 Asian Games held in Busan, South Korea.\n\nThe official television host broadcaster of the Afro-Asian Games was DD Sports, India's first sports channel. The experience gained through broadcasting these Games would prove to be extremely helpful for its parent company Doordarshan, as they broadcast the 2004 Olympic Games live and will also be telecasting the 2010 Commonwealth Games. However, the schedule of the Games clashed with an ongoing Triangular Cricket Tournament, and the events were aired on DD Metro. Doordarshan deployed 350 personnel, 10 outdoor broadcasting vans and 86 cameras for obtaining coverage of the Games. Additionally, five cameras were used for the Sports news and the sidelights.\n\nIndia's premier radio broadcaster, the All India Radio (A.I.R), was the official radio partner of the Games. The AIR hired 150 programmers and engineers for the coverage of the Games.\n\nThe opening and closing ceremonies were described as \"eye-filling\" and \"opulent\" by several media centers. The ceremonies cost INR 150 million (US$3.34 million) to execute. Children from India, China and some African nations had practiced for a reported 21 days to ensure the success of the beginning and the end of the Inaugural Games. The settings utilised for the ceremonies were designed by well-known art director and film production designer Nitin Chandrakant Desai.\n\nThe Opening ceremony of the Games were held in the G. M. C. Balayogi Stadium - the main stadium of the events - at 5:30 pm IST. The organisers considered it as \"a benchmark of the Games\". The Opening ceremony of the Games showcased the cultural heritage of both the attending continents - Asia and Africa. 30,000 people came to watch the beginning of the gala sporting event. The ceremony, which was hosted by Bollywood actor Priyanka Chopra, was spread over a time period of two hours and forty minutes. Many celebrities, like actor Sanjay Dutt and tennis player Leander Paes graced the occasion. Also, six-time pole vault winner Sergey Bubka, along with his wife, attended the ceremony.\n\nAround 12,000 schoolchildren and college students came up with a show depicting the vast and vibrant culture of the two continents.\n\nChief Guest L K Advani declared the Games open. Shooter Anjali Bhagwat took the Athlete's Oath. This was followed by a laser show, fireworks and a space cannon show. The highlight of the Opening ceremony was the \"Umojas\" - a group of professional tribal dancers from Africa. There were other international showcases - the spiritual chanting by the Chinese monks, and the peace prayers by thousands of schoolchildren. Singer Shankar Mahadevan sang the theme song. Bollywood divas Shilpa Shetty, Simran and Urmila Matondkar did dance performances.\n\nUnlike the Olympic Games, there was no individual march past for the countries. The countries came in batches of two - Asian countries in one batch and African countries in another.\n\nThe closing ceremony of the Games was marked by lights, colour and technology.\n\nThe closing ceremony was hosted by Yukta Mookhey. President APJ Abdul Kalam officially closed the Games, in front of a near capacity crowd. His closing words were : \"I congratulate all the athletes and officials who were part of the Games. When I see thousands of sportspersons I am sure the combined power of youth through sport will be the most powerful resource on earth.\" As he did so, the Stadium was lit up in a pyrotechnics display, and fireworks burst in the sky. A \"daredevil\" act was done by a few service personnel, who came riding on motorcycles. A fly-past of the Indian Army airplanes, trailing smoke in the colours of the Indian flag took place as the dignitaries took their seats.\n\nThe expected \"high-point\" of the closing ceremony was the show of camaraderie between the sportspersons of the two continents. However, few athletes trooped into the Stadium for that purpose. The \"camaraderie ceremony\" was followed by speeches of various important people, among them being IOA President Suresh Kalmadi, IOA and OCA Secretary-General Raja Randhir Singh, ANOCA President Alfa Ibrahim Diallo, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu and Union Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports Vikram Verma. The speeches were shortly followed by a memento presentation.\n\nAs night fell, hundreds of Army recruits brought lighted torches, and did the \"mashal dance\". Laser lights and several technological innovations followed. Sheroo, the mascot, was bid farewell by noted Indian singer Hariharan and many costumed children. The \"Umojas\" performed yet again at the closing ceremony. The Chinese State circus was considered \"breath-taking\". Lebanese singer Diana Haddad, Egyptian singer Hisham Abbas and Indian singer Remo Fernandes performed at the closing ceremony as well.\n\nThe host country was portrayed by a number of traditional folk dances, after which the Games officially ended.\n\n\nThe official medal tally of the Afro-Asian Games is given below. China bagged the largest number of gold medals, followed by the host India in second place. Athletes from India won the most number of total medals, with 80.\nThe success of the Games was a point in favor of India being able to host a major international sporting event. Subsequently, this success was used in the bidding of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, which was ultimately awarded to Delhi.\n\nIn addition, the hospitality sector received a major boost due to the games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who were coming to see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record number of visitors.\n\nAlso, famous local markets witnessed exceptional growth in sales and business, as demand peaked during the Games. Business of the world-renowned pearls of Hyderabad increased by about 50%, generating revenue of 50 million in one week. The rise in buyers was mainly driven by African visitors, who prefer pearls as jewellery. Also, sale of gold jewellery increased substantially, being driven by a large number of Muslim visitors who looked for traditional and intricate designs. In addition, bangles became the center of attraction for Chinese and African athletes.\n"}

{"id": "5823496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5823496", "title": "Arthur Orton", "text": "Arthur Orton\n\nArthur Orton (20 March 1834 – 1 April 1898), the son of a London butcher, went to sea as a boy, spent a year in Chile, and worked as a butcher and stockman for squatters in Australia in the middle-to-late 1850s. He has generally been identified by legal historians and commentators as the \"Tichborne Claimant\", who in two celebrated court cases both fascinated and shocked Victorian society in the 1860s and 1870s.\n\nIn 1866 Thomas Castro, a butcher from Wagga Wagga in Australia, claimed to be Roger Tichborne, the heir to the Tichborne estates and baronetcy who had been declared lost at sea in 1854. During the protracted court proceedings that followed Castro's claim, evidence was produced that Castro might in fact be Arthur Orton, attempting to secure the Tichborne fortunes by imposture. The verdict of the jury in \"Regina versus Castro\" (1873–74) was that Castro was not Roger Tichborne, and that he was Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment for perjury. After his release he lived in great poverty, still insisting that he was Tichborne. In 1895 he confessed to being Orton, but retracted almost immediately. He died in 1898; the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the names \"Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne\" to be placed on the coffin.\n\nCommentators have generally concurred with the court's verdict that the Claimant was Orton, but some 20th-century analysts have raised uncertainties about this accepted view, and have suggested that although the Orton identity remains the most likely, a lingering doubt remains.\n\nOrton was born at Wapping, London, the son of George Orton, a butcher and purveyor of ships' stores. \nHe left school early and was employed in his father's shop. In 1849, he was apprenticed to a Captain Brooks of the ship \"Ocean\". The ship sailed to South America and in June 1849 Orton deserted and went to the small Chilean country town of Melipilla. He stayed in Chile for a year and seven months and befriended the Castro family. Orton then went back to London as an ordinary seaman.\n\nIn November 1852 he sailed for Tasmania aboard the \"Middleton\" and arrived at Hobart in May 1853. There, Orton worked for several butchers. There is some evidence he was a heavy drinker; and for minor trade malpractices, he appeared before magistrates. The Hobart Mercury of 1 Aug 1855 reports on the case of 'Fane v. Orton' in the Mayor's Court in which the City Surveyor brought a charge of 'offering for sale...unwholesome meat, unfit for human food' against 'Arthur Orton, butcher, Macquarie-street' to which Orton pleaded guilty. In October 1855, Orton appeared on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences brought by Frederick Dight, after Orton had been a witness against Dight in an earlier Supreme Court trial, but the case was dismissed. \n\nFrom 1855 to the mid-1860s there is little detail about his life, but he appears to have pursued gold prospecting, mail-running and pastoral station hand-work, with a suggestion of bushranging and even murder. Orton left Hobart as a passenger on schooner 'Eclipse' on 16 November 1855 bound for Port Albert on the coast of Gippsland, Victoria. He worked for some time on squatters 'runs' in the district. While employed at one he was said to have written 'on a fly-leaf of one of the station novels' and this was later offered as evidence that Orton did not have the education that would have been expected of Tichborne:\n\n\"This day i have received a letter from Donald MacDonald. With the Seal Broken. i Arthur Orton here make a vow on this Book. Although not a Bible. It bear a cross, That i am a man of Bone Blood and flesh. That i will find out the Man if Possible. That broke the said Seal. And that i will punish him according to the laws of, My Countrie.<br>Sined Arthur Orton<br> Dargo <br>11 March 1858\"\n\nIn May 1856, he appears in a subscription list, donating £2, for 'the Patriotic Fund from the Upper District of Gippsland' as a stockman and 'one of the men' of 'Mewburn Park'. In April 1859, a letter to the editor of the 'Gippsland Guardian' mentions Orton, 'who was in charge of the Dargo station', and recounts Orton's testimony in relation to 'the mysterious disappearance of William Henry Clare alias Ballaarat Harry, and Thomas Took'.\n\nOrton's letters to England while he was in Hobart showed he was fond of dogs and children and affectionate towards his girlfriend in Wapping. However a personal notice in a Hobart newspaper from May 1856 – 'If this should meet the eye of Arthur Orton, formerly of 69, Wapping, London, by applying on board the \"Irene\", he will hear of his friends.' – after he had departed for Victoria raises the question of when the correspondence may have ended.\n\nIn August 1865 advertisements appeared in Australian newspapers asking for information about the fate of Roger Charles Tichborne (born 1829), who had been on a vessel \" Bella\" which disappeared at sea off South America in 1854. This advertisement had been inserted by Lady Tichborne, the missing man's mother, who believed her son was still alive. Roger Tichborne had, however, been presumed dead by the courts and his younger brother had thus succeeded to the Tichborne baronetcy and the family's estates.\n\nIn 1866, through his solicitor William Gibbes, a butcher in Wagga Wagga known as \"Thomas Castro\" came forward, claiming to be the missing Sir Roger. He appeared to have some knowledge of the missing man's background and family history, although many of his assertions were inaccurate or false. However, at Gibbes's prompting he wrote to Lady Tichborne and was invited to come to England to be recognised. It is the contention of most historians that the Claimant was Arthur Orton, whose travels had at some time crossed the path of Roger Tichborne whose identity the former had then adopted.\n\nThe Scotland Yard detective Jack Whicher discovered that immediately on his arrival in England in December 1866 the Claimant visited Wapping and made enquiries about the Orton family. When this visit was made public during the legal processes, it was presented as strong evidence that the Claimant was indeed Arthur Orton. However, Lady Tichborne recognised him as her son with complete certainty; he was likewise accepted as Roger by numerous family servants and professional advisers. In his analysis of the affair, Rohan McWilliam considers the extent of recognition remarkable, given the physical bulk and unrefined manners of the Claimant, as compared with the Roger Tichborne of 1854. Almost all the rest of the Tichborne family considered the Claimant an imposter. Nevertheless, he obtained much financial support for the prosecution of his claim, which went ahead despite the death of Lady Tichborne in 1868. After a lengthy civil hearing the jury dismissed the Claimant's case to be Sir Roger; he was then arrested and tried for perjury under the name of Thomas Castro. In the trial that followed the jury declared that he was not Roger Tichborne and identified him on the evidence as Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, of which he served 10 before his release on licence in 1884.\n\nAfter his release the Claimant continued to press his claim, but gradually lost his following. By the mid-1890s he was impoverished;\nin 1895, for a fee of several hundred pounds, he published a confession in \"The People\" that he was Orton. However, almost immediately he repudiated this confession, and styled himself once again as Sir Roger Tichborne.\nHe died on 1 April 1898 in impoverished circumstances, and was given a pauper's burial. In \"an act of extraordinary generosity\", the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name \"Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne\" to be placed on the coffin before its interment.\n\nThe modern consensus is that the Claimant was Orton, who had used family information obtained from gullible or self-serving supporters. However, in his 1957 account of the case, Douglas Woodruff insists that at least some degree of doubt as to the Claimant's true identity must remain. Woodruff argues the sheer improbability of anyone conceiving such an imposture from scratch and at such a distance: \"[I]t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son\". Orton's cause continued to be upheld during the 20th century by his eldest daughter, one of four children borne him by his wife, who lived until 1926.\n\nHe was fictionalized by Jorge Luis Borges in \"Tom Castro, The Implausible Impostor\", written between 1933 and 1934 and published in A Universal History of Iniquity in 1935\n\n"}

He symbolizes the \"birth\" of the next year and the \"passing\" of the prior year; in other words, a \"rebirth\". Baby New Year's purpose varies by myth, but he generally performs some sort of ceremonial duty over the course of his year such as the year's events or presiding over the year as a symbol.\n\nThe myth most associated with him is that he is a baby at the beginning of his year, but Baby New Year quickly ages until he is elderly (like Father Time, with whom he is often associated) at the end of his year. Very rarely is the Baby New Year depicted as any age other than a baby or as a very old man. Some stories, especially those with depictions of years past, will have him bear a strong likeness to key events in his time. At this point, he hands over his duties to the next Baby New Year, while he either dies or remains in this state and retires.\n\nThe stereotypical representation of Baby New Year is as a baby boy wearing nothing more than a diaper, a top hat and a sash across his torso that shows the year he is representing (e.g. 2013). He is sometimes depicted holding or associated with an hourglass, a noisemaker, or other item either pertaining to time or New Year's Day festivities. Often, he is not a complete newborn but instead more closely resembles a toddler, because he is frequently shown standing on his own, crawling or barely walking, or having a small amount of (usually blond) hair.\n\nIn addition to being a mythical figure, the title of \"Baby New Year\" is sometimes given to living people. The first baby born in any village or city in a certain year may be honored by being labeled as the official Baby New Year for that year. The official Baby New Year can be male or female, even though the mythical Baby New Year is nearly always male. Attempts to name an official Baby New Year for an entire country have sometimes been made, but generally there are multiple contenders and no single Baby New Year can be confirmed. There has however been a great deal of several who have come close. Numerous hospitals no longer make a Baby New Year public due to concerns that the infant will become a target for criminals.\n\n"}

Beat Parties are commonly associated with Beat Music and Mods.\n\nThe term Beat Party! was originally the title of the bonus disc from Australian band You Am I's album Hourly Daily. The disc contained covers by 1960s Beat Music bands The Creation and The Easybeats and his, combined with Tim Rogers's drunken declaration that he would make a \"beat\" record is where the phrase comes from.\n\nIn the late 2009 a succession of unusual parties and gatherings were held in eastern Melbourne, Australia. 1960s Beat Music was played and attendees wore 1960s styled, vintage suits or Fred Perry Polo Shirts with the buttons done up. These Beat Parties attempted to emulate the attitudes and behaviours of the English during Swinging London period.\n\nDue to the similar reference points, 1960s beat music and emphasis on fashion from the same era, Beat Parties have drawn comparisons to the Mod Revival which took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s throughout the United Kingdom.

They were inserted into the 1978–1979 edition of the official state of Michigan map. The names refer to the slogan of University of Michigan fans (\"Go Blue!\") and a reference to their archrivals from Ohio State University (\"Beat OSU\").\n\nPeter Fletcher, a Michigan alumnus and chairman of the State Highway Commission with a \"sly sense of humor\", ordered the inclusion the fake towns of \"Goblu\" (near the real town of Bono, Ohio, off State Route 2) and \"Beatosu\" (near Archbold, Ohio, just south of Interstate 80/Interstate 90/Ohio Turnpike at exit 25). Note that on the printed map, the fictitious town names appear in all lowercase letters (\"goblu\" and \"beatosu\"), while every other town name is capitalized. As well, while all real locations are clearly marked, there is no specific dot, boundary line or other marker to identify the precise location of the two fictitious towns. \n\nIn a 2008 interview, Fletcher explained that a fellow Michigan alumnus had been teasing him about the Mackinac Bridge colors: green and white, the colors of Michigan State University. Fletcher noted that the bridge colors were in compliance with federal highway regulations, so he had no choice in that matter; he did, however, have more control over the state highway map. Fletcher said that he thus ordered a cartographer to insert the two fictitious towns.\n\nIn their 2012 obituary of Fletcher, AnnArbor.com noted that the maps containing the fictional cities had a limited print run and have become collectors items. The map's publication has also been noted as a good luck charm for the University of Michigan Wolverines that year; the team beat their arch rivals 14–3 in the 1978 edition of The Game, which is the\ngreatest North American sports rivalry, according to ESPN.com.\n\nThe fictional \"G.I.

He was the first casualty of the Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force, executed by firing squad by the Germans shortly after his capture.\n\nAn engineering student before the war, Negri enlisted in the Regia Aeronautica in the course of the hostilities. After graduating from the Italian Air Force Academy in Caserta he was assigned to \"4 Stormo\" (\"Prancing Stallion\") as a \"Sottotenente\" (second Lieutenant) pilot.<br>\nHe had not been in the unit for long when the Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces was made public on 8 September 1943, ending hostilities between Italy and the Allies but \"de facto\" opening the war with their former allies. <br>\nNegri, together with most \"4 Stormo\" personnel, flew to Apulia where the Royal Family had found a safe haven after fleeing from Rome. However, this \"move\" was not made for merely political reasons: the \"Stormo\" had very strong ties with Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (and therefore with the House of Savoy) although Amedeo had left the command of the unit by the late 1930s to take up the place of Governor General of Italian East Africa and had died the year before as a POW of the British in Kenya. At any rate, Amedeo's legacy with \"4 Stormo\" is so strong that the unit bears his name to the present day.<br>\nShortly after, Regia Aeronautica (officially renamed Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force) was operational on the Allied side, flying ground attack and supply missions to relieve pressure on Regio Esercito units stuck in the Balkans and embedded in the local Resistance movements. In one such occasion, on 21 September 1943, Negri volunteered to drop a cylinder containing a message for an Italian unit encircled in Koritza, Albania.<br>\nHit by Flak, Negri was forced to land and was immediately captured by the Wehrmacht. Brought to a show trial, he was sentenced to death and shot on 23 September. He could not enjoy the protection of the Geneva Convention because there had not been any formal declaration of war between the Kingdom of Italy and Nazi Germany (which would take place only on 13 October 1943).\n\n\"Sottotenente\" Carlo Negri received the posthumous Gold Medal of Military Valor for this action.\n\nA little more than 60 years after his death (31 October 2003) 61 Stormo was named after him.

Confidence tricks exploit characteristics of the human psyche, such as credulity, naïveté, compassion, vanity, irresponsibility, and greed. Researchers Lindsey Huang and Barak Orbach defined the scheme as “a distinctive species of fraudulent conduct, . . . intending to further voluntary exchanges that are not mutually beneficial,” as they “benefit con operators (‘con men’) at the expense of their victims (the ‘marks’).” \n\nThe perpetrator of a confidence trick (or \"con trick\") is often referred to as a confidence (or \"con\") man, con-artist, or a \"grifter\". Samuel Thompson (1821–1856) was the original \"confidence man\". Thompson was a clumsy swindler who asked his victims to express confidence in him by giving him money or their watch rather than gaining their confidence in a more nuanced way. A few people trusted Thompson with their money and watches. Thompson was arrested in July 1849. Reporting about this arrest, Dr. James Houston, a reporter of the \"New York Herald\", publicized Thompson by naming him the \"Confidence Man\". Although Thompson was an unsuccessful scammer, he gained reputation as a genius operator mostly because Houston's satirical writing wasn't understood as such. The National Police Gazette coined the term \"confidence game\" a few weeks after Houston first used the name \"confidence man\".\nA confidence trick is also known as a con game, a con, a scam, a grift, a hustle, a bunko (or bunco), a swindle, a flimflam, a gaffle or a bamboozle. The intended victims are known as marks, suckers, stooges, mugus, rubes or gulls (from the word \"gullible\"). When accomplices are employed, they are known as shills.\n\nA short con or small con is a fast swindle which takes just minutes. It typically aims to rob the victim of everything in his or her wallet.\n\nA long con or big con (also, chiefly ) is a scam that unfolds over several days or weeks and involves a team of swindlers, as well as props, sets, extras, costumes, and scripted lines. It aims to rob the victim of huge sums of money or valuable things, often by getting him or her to empty out banking accounts and borrow from family members.\n\nIn \"Confessions of a Confidence Man\", Edward H. Smith lists the \"six definite steps or stages of growth\" of a confidence game. He notes that some steps may be omitted.\n\n\nIn addition, some games require a \"corroboration\" step, particularly those involving a \"rare item\". This usually includes the use of an accomplice who plays the part of an uninvolved (initially skeptical) third party, who later confirms the claims made by the con man.\n\nConfidence tricks exploit typical human characteristics such as greed, dishonesty, vanity, opportunism, lust, compassion, credulity, irresponsibility, desperation, and naïvety. As such, there is no consistent profile of a confidence trick victim; the common factor is simply that the victim relies on the good faith of the con artist. Victims of investment scams tend to show an incautious level of greed and gullibility, and many con artists target the elderly, but even alert and educated people may be taken in by other forms of a confidence trick. Researchers Huang and Orbach argue:\n\nAccomplices, also known as shills, help manipulate the mark into accepting the perpetrator's plan. In a traditional confidence trick, the mark is led to believe that he will be able to win money or some other prize by doing some task. The accomplices may pretend to be strangers who have benefited from performing the task in the past.\n\n\n"}

He was invented by Christopher Wilson in a 2000 hoax article published in the second issue of \"Dot Dot Dot\", a magazine of visual culture.\n\nAccording to the article, Bettler was asked in the 1950s to design advertisement posters for \"Pfäfferli+Huber\" (P+H), a Swiss pharmaceutical manufacturer. The article states that Bettler knew of the company's involvement in Nazi concentration camp experiments and decided to accept the commission with the intention of damaging P+H. The four posters he created, Wilson's article recounts, were exemplary works of International Typographic Style design, advertising P+H drugs such as \"Contrazipan\". However, according to the article, the posters featured abstract compositions that could be read as capital letters – spelling out \"N - A - Z - I\" when displayed in sequence. Wilson's article states that the public outcry that followed the public display of the posters ruined P+H in a matter of weeks.\n\nEven though it was highly detailed and featured many photographs and illustrations, the article was a complete fabrication. Ernst Bettler, Pfäfferli+Huber and its drugs do not exist, and neither do the Swiss towns \"Sumisdorf\" and \"Burgwald\" that feature in the article – their names are presumably based on the real Swiss towns of Sumiswald and Burgdorf. Nonetheless, the story was well received in graphic design circles. Among others, the September/October 2001 \"Graphic Anarchy\" issue of \"Adbusters\" magazine hailed Bettler's work as \"one of the greatest design interventions on record\", and the 2002 graphic design textbook \"Problem Solved\" by Michael Johnson covers Bettler as one of the \"founding fathers of the 'culture-jamming' form of protest\".\n\nWilson's article was first revealed to be false in a 2002 entry in the blog Lines and Splines by Andy Crewdson. The Bettler hoax and its reception was subsequently covered by Rick Poynor in an article in the February 2003 issue of \"Eye\" magazine, as well as by other blogs.\n\n"}

Most were evacuated during the Continuation War (1941-1944) to ease the situation for their parents who set out to rebuild their homes in the re-conquered Karelia returning from the 1940 evacuation of Finnish Karelia. The first surge of evacuees arrived, however, during the Winter War when the Finns had reasons to fear a humanitarian catastrophe following the expected Soviet occupation.\n\nIn retrospect, the evacuation has been considered psychologically flawed, as the separations turned out to inflict a far greater damage on the evacuees than the damage suffered by those children who had remained with their parents in Finland. In comparison to Finland's approximately 23,000 military casualties in the Winter War, the 66,000 in the Continuation war, and the total of 2,000 civilian casualties – and the roughly equally many seriously wounded – the war children were, of course, not physically injured, let alone killed. However, their number is of about the same size as that of the war invalids, and many of them feel their sufferings to be ignored.\n\nAfter the war, Finland experienced times of economic hardship, and also substantial insecurity with regard to the Soviet Union's plans for Finland, which resulted in the delay of the return of the children for several years. Ultimately, about 20% of the war children stayed with their foster families after the war, who often adopted them. Many more returned to Sweden as adults, when the prolonged post-war hardship in Finland pushed large contingents of unemployed Finns to Sweden's booming economy in the 1950s–60s.\n\n\"Mother of Mine\" (Finnish: \"Äideistä parhain\", Swedish: \"Den bästa av mödrar\") is a 2005 Finnish-Swedish film directed by Klaus Härö about a Finnish war child who is sent by his mother to live in Sweden during World War II.

{"id": "6600979", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6600979", "title": "Gibbon's Tennis Court", "text": "Gibbon's Tennis Court\n\nGibbon's Tennis Court was a building off Vere Street and Clare Market, near Lincoln's Inn Fields in London, England. Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse from 1660 to 1663, shortly after the English Restoration. As a theatre, it has been variously called the \"Theatre Royal, Vere Street\", the \"Vere Street Theatre\", or (as in Samuel Pepys' diary) simply \"The Theatre\". It was the first permanent home for Thomas Killigrew's King's Company and was the stage for some of the earliest appearances by professional actresses.\n\nThe theatre was destroyed by fire in 1809. The London School of Economics, which covers most of Clare Market nowadays, retains some squash and real tennis courts in its older buildings.\n\nTudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions — about 75 by 30 feet — are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court. The tennis courts were not used exclusively for tennis. In 1653, seven years before it saw lawful use as a theatre, an underground production of Killigrew's \"Claricilla\" was planned for Gibbon's court. The production was broken up before it debuted, reportedly betrayed to the army by one of the actors.\nAfter the English Restoration in 1660, Charles II granted Letters Patent to two companies to perform \"legitimate drama\" in London: the Duke's Company under the patronage of the Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and the Red Bull), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres. \n\nKilligrew's remodelled Gibbon's Tennis Court opened first, on 8 November 1660, just two months after being given permission by the Crown. The design was similar to the earlier Elizabethan-era \"private\" theatres, such as the theatre in Blackfriars: a stage devoid of scenery facing a bench-filled pit on the auditorium floor and surrounded by one or two levels of U-shaped galleries.\n\nNot long after the opening, on 20 November, avid theatre-goer Samuel Pepys attended his first performance at Vere Street:\n…Mr. Shepley and I to the new Play-house near Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields (which was formerly Gibbon’s tennis-court), where the play of \"Beggar’s Bush\" was newly begun; and so we went in and saw it, it was well acted: and here I saw the first time one Moone, who is said to be the best actor in the world, lately come over with the King, and indeed it is the finest play-house, I believe, that ever was in England.\nPepys' high praise for the theatre is often taken to reflect his excitement regarding London's burgeoning theatrical scene rather than as commentary than on the quality of the tennis-court theatre itself. John Styan says it \"seems a questionable statement about so makeshift a theatre.\" Killigrew's competition, Davenant, would take another seven months to open his new theatre in nearby Lisle's Tennis Court; working more from the model of court masque venues such as Inigo Jones’ Cockpit-in-Court, he equipped it with a stage complete with a proscenium arch and moveable scenery, painted onto a series of sliding panels. Opening in late June, 1661, Davenant's theatre would steal much of Vere Street's thunder.\n\nBefore then, though, Killigrew would generate some more excitement of his own, by being the first to stage plays with actresses, instead of actors, playing female roles. The first occasion, based on its newly-written prologue, is thought to have been a performance of \"Othello\" on 8 December 1660; authorities differ as to the name of the actress who played Desdemona. Pepys records a 3 January 1661 restaging of \"Beggar’s Bush\" as \"the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.\"\n\nAfter Davenant’s theatre in Lisle’s Tennis Court opened, Vere Street’s popularity waned. Pepys, 4 July 1661: \"I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw \"Claracilla\" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.\" To remain competitive, Killigrew decided to construct a purpose-built theatre more to modern tastes. On 7 May 1663, just two-and-a-half years after the theatre in Lisle's Tennis Court opened, the King's Company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Bridges Street. \n\nAccording to an 1811 Robert Wilkinson image, Gibbon's Tennis Court was destroyed by fire on 17 September 1809. In the 20th century, the Stoll Theatre and the Peacock Theatre would be built at the same site.\n"}
{"id": "29032191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29032191", "title": "Great Recession in the United States", "text": "Great Recession in the United States\n\nThe Great Recession in the United States was a severe financial crisis combined with a deep recession. While the recession officially lasted from December 2007 to June 2009, it took several years for the economy to recover to pre-crisis levels of employment and output. This slow recovery was due in part to households and financial institutions paying off debts accumulated in the years preceding the crisis along with restrained government spending following initial stimulus efforts. It followed the bursting of the housing bubble, the housing market correction and subprime mortgage crisis. \n\nThe U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that \"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels.\"\n\nAccording to the Department of Labor, roughly 8.7 million jobs (about 7%) were shed from February 2008 to February 2010, and real GDP contracted by 4.2% between Q4 2007 and Q2 2009, making the Great Recession the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. The GDP bottom, or trough, was reached in the second quarter of 2009 (marking the technical end of the recession, defined as at least two consecutive quarters of declining GDP). Real (inflation-adjusted) GDP did not regain its pre-crisis (Q4 2007) peak level until Q3 2011. Unemployment rose from 4.7% in November 2007 to peak at 10% in October 2009, before returning steadily to 4.7% in May 2016. The total number of jobs did not return to November 2007 levels until May 2014. \n\nHouseholds and non-profit organizations added approximately $8 trillion in debt during the 2000-2008 period (roughly doubling it and fueling the housing bubble), then reduced their debt level from the peak in Q3 2008 until Q3 2012, the only period this debt declined since at least the 1950s. However, the debt held by the public rose from 35% GDP in 2007 to 77% GDP by 2016, as the government spent more while the private sector (e.g., households and businesses, particularly the banking sector) reduced the debt burdens accumulated during the pre-recession decade. President Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush Administration and continued during his Administration as completed and mostly profitable as of December 2014.\n\nAfter the Great Depression of the 1930s, the American economy experienced robust growth, with periodic lesser recessions, for the rest of the 20th century. The federal government enforced the Securities Exchange Act (1934) and The Chandler Act (1938), which tightly regulated the financial markets. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulated the trading of the secondary securities market and The Chandler Act regulated the transactions in the banking sector.\n\nThere were a few investment banks, small by current standards, that expanded during the late 1970s, such as JP Morgan. The Reagan Administration in the early 1980s began a thirty-year period of financial deregulation. The financial sector sharply expanded, in part because investment banks were going public, bringing them vast sums of stockholder capital. From 1978 to 2008, the average salary for workers outside of investment banking in the U.S. increased from $40k to $50k – a 25 percent salary increase - while the average salary in investment banking increased from $40k to $100k – a 150 percent salary increase. Deregulation also precipitated financial fraud - often tied to real estate investments - sometimes on a grand scale, such as the savings and loan crisis. By the end of the 1980s, many workers in the financial sector were being jailed for fraud, but many Americans were losing their life savings. Large investment banks began merging and developing Financial conglomerates; this led to the formation of the giant investment banks like Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn the early months of 2008, many observers believed that a U.S. recession had begun. The collapse of Bear Stearns and the resulting financial market turbulence signaled that the crisis would not be mild and brief.\n\nAlan Greenspan, ex-Chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated in March 2008 that the 2008 financial crisis in the United States \"is likely to be judged in retrospect as the most wrenching since the end of World War II\". A chief economist at Standard & Poor's said in March 2008 he had projected a worst-case-scenario in which the country would endure a double-dip recession, in which the economy would briefly recover in the summer 2008, before plunging again. Under this scenario, the economy's total output, as measured by the gross domestic product (GDP), would drop by 2.2 percentage points, making it among the worst recessions in the post World War II period.\n\nThe former head of the National Bureau of Economic Research said in March 2008 that he believed the country was then in a recession, and it could be a severe one. A number of private economists generally predicted a mild recession ending in the summer of 2008 when the economic stimulus checks going to 130 million households started being spent. A chief economist at Moody's predicted in March 2008 that policymakers would act in a concerted and aggressive way to stabilize the financial markets, and that the economy would suffer, but not enter a prolonged and severe recession. It takes many months before the National Bureau of Economic Research, the unofficial arbiter of when recessions begin and end, would make its own ruling.\n\nAccording to numbers published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in May 2008, the GDP growth of the previous two quarters was positive. As one common definition of a recession is negative economic growth for at least two consecutive fiscal quarters, some analysts suggested this indicates that the U.S. economy was not in a recession at the time. However, this estimate has been disputed by analysts who argue that if inflation is taken into account, the GDP growth was negative for those two quarters, making it a technical recession. In a May 9, 2008 report, the chief North American economist for investment bank Merrill Lynch wrote that despite the GDP growth reported for the first quarter of 2008, \"it is still reasonable to believe that the recession started some time between September and January\", on the grounds that the National Bureau of Economic Research's four recession indicators all peaked during that period.\n\nNew York's budget director concluded the state of New York was officially in a recession by the summer of 2008. Governor David Paterson called an emergency economic session of the state legislature for August 19 to push a budget cut of $600 million on top of a hiring freeze and a 7 percent reduction in spending at state agencies that had already been implemented by the Governor. An August 1 report, issued by economists with Wachovia Bank, said Florida was officially in a recession.\n\nWhite House budget director Jim Nussle maintained at that time that the U.S. had avoided a recession, following revised GDP numbers from the Commerce Department showing a 0.2 percent contraction in the fourth quarter of 2007 down from a 0.6 percent increase, and a downward revision to 0.9 percent from 1 percent in the first quarter of 2008. The GDP for the second quarter was placed at a 1.9 percent expansion, below an expected 2 percent. On the other hand, Martin Feldstein, who headed the National Bureau of Economic Research and served on the group's recession-dating panel, said he believed the U.S. was in a very long recession and that there was nothing the Federal Reserve could do to change it.\n\nIn a CNBC interview at the end of July 2008, Alan Greenspan said he believed the U.S. was not yet in a recession, but that it could enter one due to a global economic slowdown.\n\nA study released by Moody's found two-thirds of the 381 largest metropolitan areas in the United States were in a recession. The study also said 28 states were in recession, with 16 at risk. The findings were based on unemployment figures and industrial production data.\n\nIn March 2008, financier Warren Buffett stated in a CNBC interview that by a \"common sense definition\", the U.S. economy was already in a recession. Buffett has also stated that the definition of recession is flawed and that it should be three consecutive quarters of GDP growth that is less than population growth. However, the U.S. only experienced two consecutive quarters of GDP growth less than population growth.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke testified in September 2010 regarding the causes of the crisis. He wrote that there were shocks or triggers (i.e., particular events that touched off the crisis) and vulnerabilities (i.e., structural weaknesses in the financial system, regulation and supervision) that amplified the shocks. Examples of triggers included: losses on subprime mortgage securities that began in 2007 and a run on the shadow banking system that began in mid-2007, which adversely affected the functioning of money markets. Examples of vulnerabilities in the \"private\" sector included: financial institution dependence on unstable sources of short-term funding such as repurchase agreements or Repos; deficiencies in corporate risk management; excessive use of leverage (borrowing to invest); and inappropriate usage of derivatives as a tool for taking excessive risks. Examples of vulnerabilities in the \"public\" sector included: statutory gaps and conflicts between regulators; ineffective use of regulatory authority; and ineffective crisis management capabilities. Bernanke also discussed \"Too big to fail\" institutions, monetary policy, and trade deficits.\n\nThe U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported its findings in January 2011. It concluded that \"the crisis was avoidable and was caused by: Widespread failures in financial regulation, including the Federal Reserve's failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages; Dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk; An explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis; Key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis, lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels.\"\n\nAmong the important catalysts of the subprime crisis were the influx of money from the private sector, the banks entering into the mortgage bond market, government policies aimed at expanding homeownership, speculation by many home buyers, and the predatory lending practices of the mortgage lenders, specifically the adjustable-rate mortgage, 2–28 loan, that mortgage lenders sold directly or indirectly via mortgage brokers. On Wall Street and in the financial industry, moral hazard lay at the core of many of the causes.\n\nA federal inquiry found that some federal government policies (or lack of them) were responsible to a large extent for the recession in the United States and the resultant vast unemployment. Factors include:\n\n\nAlan Greenspan was the Chairman of the Federal Reserve of the United States from 1987 to 2006. He was appointed by President Ronald Reagan in August 1987 and was reappointed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. He was, perhaps, the person most singly responsible for the housing bubble in the U.S., although he said that \"I really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.\" Greenspan stated that the housing bubble was \"fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates\", though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because \"the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $100 trillion\" and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they \"now swamp the resources of central banks\".\n\nOn December 1, 2008, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) declared that the United States entered a recession in December 2007, citing employment and production figures as well as the third quarter decline in GDP. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 679 points that same day. On January 4, 2009, Nobel Memorial Prize–winning economist Paul Krugman wrote, \"This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression.\"\n\nThe Great Recession cost millions of jobs initially and high unemployment lingered for years after the official end of the recession in June 2009. One of the frightening aspects of the crisis was how fast jobs were lost in the midst of the crisis. From November 2008 to April 2009, an average of 744,000 jobs were lost per month; for scale, about 200,000 jobs were created per month from 2011-2016. At the time, no one knew how deep the recession would go, which is one reason Congress passed and President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in January 2009. Known as \"The Stimulus\", ARRA was a roughly $800 billion mix of tax cuts (about one-third) and spending programs (about two-thirds) with the primary impact spread over three years. Many economists argued the stimulus was too small, while conservatives such as the Tea Party argued that deficit reduction was the priority.\n\nThe number of jobs (\"total non-farm payrolls\" which includes both private sector and government jobs) reached a peak of 138.4 million in January 2008, then fell to a trough (bottom) of 129.7 million in February 2010, a decline of nearly 8.8 million jobs or 6.8%. The number of jobs did not regain the January 2008 level until May 2014. For comparison, the severe 1981-82 recession had a jobs decline of 3.2%. Full-time employment did not regain its pre-crisis level until August 2015.\n\nThe unemployment rate (\"U-3\") rose from the pre-recession level of 4.7% in November 2008 to a peak of 10.0% in October 2009, before steadily falling back to the pre-recession level by May 2016. One factor to consider is that the job count was artificially high and the unemployment rate was artificially low prior to the recession due to an unsustainable housing bubble, which had increased construction and other employment substantially. In 2003, prior to the significant expansion of subprime lending of 2004-2006, the unemployment rate was close to 6%. The wider measure of unemployment (\"U-6\") which includes those employed part-time for economic reasons or marginally attached to the labor force rose from 8.4% pre-crisis to a peak of 17.1% in October 2009. It did not regain the pre-crisis level until May 2017.\n\nBloomberg maintains a \"dashboard\" of several labor-market variables that illustrates the state of recovery of the labor market.\n\nThe major investment banks at the core of the crisis obtained significant funding in overnight Repo markets, which were disrupted during the crisis. In effect, there was a run on the essentially unregulated shadow banking (non-depository) banking system, which had grown larger than the regulated depository system. Unable to obtain financing, they were forced to merge (in the case of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch), declare bankruptcy (Lehman Brothers) or obtain federal depository bank charters and private loans (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Insurer AIG, which had guaranteed many of the liabilities of these and other banks around the globe through derivatives called credit default swaps, also was bailed-out and taken over by the government at an initial cost exceeding $100 billion. The bailout of AIG was essentially a conduit for the U.S. government to bailout banks around the world, as the money was used by AIG to make good on its obligations.\n\nA timeline of some of the significant events in the crisis from 2007-2008 includes:\n\nThe year 2008, as of September 17, had seen 81 public corporations file for bankruptcy in the United States, already higher than the 78 for all of 2007. The largest corporate bankruptcy in U.S. history also made 2008 a record year in terms of assets, with Lehman's size—$691 billion in assets—alone surpassing all past annual totals. The year also saw the ninth biggest bankruptcy, with the failure of IndyMac Bank.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" stated that venture capital funding slowed down, which in the past had led to unemployment and slowed new job creation. The Federal Reserve took steps to feed economic expansion by lowering the prime rate repeatedly during 2008.\n\nOn September 17, 2008, Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke advised Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson that a large amount of public money would be needed to stabilize the financial system. Short selling on 799 financial stocks was banned on September 19. Companies were also forced to disclose large short positions. The Treasury Secretary also indicated that money funds would create an insurance pool to cover themselves against losses and that the government would buy mortgage-backed securities from banks and investment houses. Initial estimates of the cost of the Treasury bailout proposed by the Bush Administration's draft legislation (as of September 19, 2008) were in the range of $700 billion to $1 trillion U.S. dollars. President George W. Bush asked Congress on September 20, 2008 for the authority to spend as much as $700 billion to purchase troubled mortgage assets and contain the financial crisis. The crisis continued when the United States House of Representatives rejected the bill and the Dow Jones took a 777-point plunge. A revised version of the bill was later passed by Congress, but the stock market continued to fall nevertheless. The first half of the bailout money was primarily used to buy preferred stock in banks, instead of troubled mortgage assets. This flew in the face of some economists' argument that buying preferred stock would be far less effective than buying common stock.\n\nAs of mid-November 2008, it was estimated that the new loans, purchases, and liabilities of the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and FDIC, brought on by the financial crisis, totalled over $5 trillion: $1 trillion in loans by the Fed to broker-dealers through the emergency discount window, $1.8 trillion in loans by the Fed through the Term Auction Facility, $700 billion to be raised by the Treasury for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, $200 billion insurance for the GSEs by the Treasury, and $1.5 trillion insurance for unsecured bank debt by FDIC.\n\nProPublica maintains a \"bailout tracker\" that indicated about $626 billion was \"spent, invested or loaned\" in bailouts of the financial system due to the crisis as of March 2018, while $713 billion had been repaid to the government ($390 billion in principal repayments and $323 billion in interest) indicating the bailouts generated $87 billion in profit.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, Treasury, and Securities and Exchange Commission took several steps on September 19 to intervene in the crisis. To stop the potential run on money market mutual funds, the Treasury also announced on September 19 a new $50 billion program to insure the investments, similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) program. Part of the announcements included temporary exceptions to section 23A and 23B (Regulation W), allowing financial groups to more easily share funds within their group. The exceptions would expire on January 30, 2009, unless extended by the Federal Reserve Board. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced termination of short-selling of 799 financial stocks, as well as action against naked short selling, as part of its reaction to the mortgage crisis.\n\nThe recession officially ended in the second quarter of 2009, but the nation's economy continued to be described as in an \"economic malaise\" during the second quarter of 2011. Some economists described the post-recession years as the weakest recovery since the Great Depression and World War II. The weak recovery led one commentator to call it a \"Zombie Economy\", so-called because it was neither dead nor alive. Household incomes, as of August 2012 continued falling after the end of the recession, eventually declining 7.2% below the December 2007 level. Additionally as of September 2012, the long-term unemployment is the highest it had been since World War II, and the unemployment rate peaked several months after the end of the recession (10.1% in October 2009) and was above 8% until September 2012 (7.8%). The Federal Reserve kept interest rates at a historically low 0.25% from December 2008 until December 2015, when it began to raise them again.\n\nHowever, the Great Recession was different in kind from the all the recessions since the Great Depression, as it also involved a banking crisis and the de-leveraging (debt reduction) of highly indebted households. Research indicates recovery from financial crises can be protracted, with lengthy periods of high unemployment and substandard economic growth. Economist Carmen Reinhart stated in August 2011: \"Debt de-leveraging [reduction] takes about seven years ... And in the decade following severe financial crises, you tend to grow by 1 to 1.5 percentage points less than in the decade before, because the decade before was fueled by a boom in private borrowing, and not all of that growth was real. The unemployment figures in advanced economies after falls are also very dark. Unemployment remains anchored about five percentage points above what it was in the decade before.\"\n\nThen-Fed Chair Ben Bernanke explained during November 2012 several of the economic headwinds that slowed the recovery:\n\nFor example, U.S. federal spending rose from 19.1% GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2007 to 24.4% GDP in FY2009 (the last year budgeted by President Bush) before falling towards to 20.4% GDP in 2014, closer to the historical average. In dollar terms, federal spending was actually higher in 2009 than in 2014, despite a historical trend of a roughly 5% annual increase. This reduced real GDP growth by approximately 0.5% per quarter on average between Q3 2010 and Q2 2014. Both households and government practicing austerity at the same time was a recipe for a slow recovery.\n\nSeveral key economic variables (e.g., Job level, real GDP per capita, stock market, and household net worth) hit their low point (trough) in 2009 or 2010, after which they began to turn upward, recovering to pre-recession (2007) levels between late 2012 and May 2014 (close to Reinhart's prediction), which marked the recovery of all jobs lost during the recession. Real median household income fell to a trough of $53,331 in 2012, but recovered to an all-time high of $59,039 by 2016. However, the gains during the recovery were very unevenly distributed. Economist Emmanuel Saez wrote in June 2016 that the top 1% of families captured 52% of the total real income (GDP) growth per family from 2009-2015. The gains were more evenly distributed after the tax increases in 2013 on higher-income earners. According to the Federal Reserve, median family net worth had peaked at about $140,000 in 2007, fell to a low point of $84,000 in 2013, and only partially recovered to $97,000 by 2016. Middle-class families had much of their wealth in housing, driving much of the decline when the housing bubble burst.\n\nHealthcare costs in the United States slowed in the period after the Great Recession (2008–2012). A decrease in inflation and in the number of hospital stays per population drove a reduction in the rate of growth in aggregate hospital costs at this time. Growth slowed most for surgical stays and least for maternal and neonatal stays.\n\nPresident Obama declared the bailout measures started under the Bush Administration and continued during his Administration as completed and mostly profitable as of December 2014. As of January 2018, bailout funds had been fully recovered by the government, when interest on loans is taken into consideration. A total of $626B was invested, loaned, or granted due to various bailout measures, while $390B had been returned to the Treasury. The Treasury had earned another $323B in interest on bailout loans, resulting in an $87B profit.\n\n"}

{"id": "18047195", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18047195", "title": "Implied consent", "text": "Implied consent\n\nImplied consent is consent which is not expressly granted by a person, but rather implicitly granted by a person's actions and the facts and circumstances of a particular situation (or in some cases, by a person's silence or inaction). The term is most commonly encountered in the context of United States drunk driving laws. There are no U.S. States that allow implied consent as an excuse for rape in a court of law.\n\nAll U.S. states have driver licensing laws which state that a licensed driver has given their implied consent to a certified breathalyzer or by a blood sample by their choice, or similar manner of determining blood alcohol concentration. Implied consent laws may result in punishment for those who refuse to cooperate with blood alcohol testing after an arrest for suspected impaired driving, including civil consequences such as a driver's license suspension.\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Birchfield v. North Dakota\" held that both breath tests and blood tests constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment, concluding that requiring breath tests is constitutional without a search warrant, however, requiring more intrusive blood tests involving piercing the skin is not, as the goal of traffic safety can be obtained by less invasive means. Specifically addressing implied consent laws, the court in the Birchfield opinion stated that while their \"prior opinions have referred approvingly to the general concept of implied-consent laws\" that \"there must be a limit to the consequences to which motorists may be deemed to have consented by virtue of a decision to drive on public roads\" and \"that motorists could be deemed to have consented to only those conditions that are 'reasonable' in that they have a 'nexus' to the privilege of driving\".\n\nIn 2016, \"People v. Arredondo\", the California Courts of appeals debated whether authorities could seize an unwarranted blood sample from an unconscious person suspected of driving under the influence without offending the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against unreasonable searches or seizures. The court ruled that the defendant \"consented to such a search in advance solely by operation of the statute in California, which declares that anyone who drives a vehicle in this state is \"deemed to have given his or her consent\" to blood alcohol testing under specified conditions. Though Arredondo was unconscious at the time his blood was drawn, the court found that the \"warrantless search was justified on the consent since California's \"implied consent\" law states \"one who drives a motor vehicle in this state is \"deemed\" to consent to blood alcohol testing\". Moreover, the court ruled that the extraction was justified by \"exigent circumstances, statutorily implied consent, the officer's belief that the extraction was lawful in light of long-standing practice under prior case law and good faith reliance on the implied consent statute\".\n\nIn 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States in Schmerber v. California held that a warrantless blood sample is justified under the Fourth Amendment's pressing circumstances because alcohol in one's blood would be diminished by the body's natural metabolic system if officers were to wait for a warrant. The Fifth Amendment only applies to interrogation and testimony and does not prohibit blood tests. The case resulted in a conviction because it was decided that blood test results do not constitute testimony, proof of a confession or any other communicative acts.\n\nIn the United States, implied consent laws generally do not apply to Preliminary Breath Test (PBT) testing (small handheld devices, as opposed to evidential breath test devices). For a handheld field breath tester to be used as evidential breath testing, the device must be properly certified and calibrated, evidential procedures must be followed, and it may be necessary to administer an \"implied consent\" warning to the suspect prior to testing.\n\nIn most US jurisdictions, participation in a PBT test is voluntary; however for some violations, such as refusals by commercial drivers or by drivers under 21 years of age, some US jurisdictions may impose implied consent consequences for a PBT refusal. For example, the state of Michigan has a roadside PBT law that requires motorist a preliminary breath test; however, for non-commercial drivers Michigan's penalties are limited to a \"civil infraction\" penalty, with no violation \"points\".\n\nParticipation in \"field sobriety tests\" (FSTs or SFSTs) is voluntary in the US.\n\nTypically, a party has the right to object in court to a line of questioning or at the introduction of a particular piece of evidence. If the party fails to object in a timely fashion, he is deemed to have waived his right to object and cannot raise the objection on appeal. This is a form of implied consent.\n\nIn California, \"Any person providing the <nowiki>[</nowiki>California Department of Motor Vehicles<nowiki>]</nowiki> with a mailing address shall … consent to\nreceive service of process …\".\n\nIn Canada, implied consent has not been a defence for sexual assault since the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada case of \"R v Ewanchuk\", where the court unanimously ruled that consent has to be explicit, instead of merely \"implied\".\n\nIn the United States, rape has traditionally been defined as the victim's nonconsent to sexual intercourse. However, \"the law of rape is founded on a paradigm of violent stranger rape which fails to clearly proscribe less violent rapes.\" This ambiguity requires the courts to determine whether the victim consented or not. During this process it is possible that, \"courts examine objective evidence of the woman's state of mind, such as her behavior during the alleged rape and her character in general.\" This would allow the defense a chance to convince the court that consent was in some way implied by the victim. Many actions can be perceived by the court as implied consent: having a previous relationship with the alleged rapist (e.g. befriending, dating, cohabitating, or marrying), consenting to sexual contact on previous occasions, flirting, wearing \"provocative\" clothing, etc. These actions are not explicitly defined by the law as indicators of consent; however, the court may come to the conclusion that these actions in some way implied consent, as has often been the result in non-stranger rape cases. Implied consent may also be used as a defense in the case of violent stranger rape.\n\nCommon law rape is generally defined as \"the act of a man having unlawful carnal knowledge of a female over the age of ten years by force without the consent and against the will of the victim\" While force is a key element of rape, the evidence must conclude that either the victim resisted and their resistance was overcome by force, or that they were prevented from resisting because their safety was threatened. However, since resistance is relevant to crimes of sexual assault, the presence or absence of it depends on the facts and circumstances in each case. While consent may involve submission, submission itself does not necessarily imply consent. In other words, \"submission to a compelling force, or as a result of being put in fear, is not consent\" since it has been proven that non-resistance or compliance with an attacker's request is a way to protect oneself from additional and often more severe abuse. \"Genuine and continuing fear of such harm\", or abuse, \"on the part of the persecuting witness\" is a significant factor in determining whether the attacker committed a \"felonious and forcible act against the will and consent of the prosecuting witness\". As a tactic for survival, rape counselors advise women to \"do whatever is necessary to protect themselves from physical injury and to save their lives\" in a threatening situation.\n\nIn many common law jurisdictions, a couple who married were deemed to have given \"implied consent\" to have sex with each other, a doctrine which barred prosecution of a spouse for rape. This doctrine is now considered obsolete in Western countries.\n\nIn the United States, however, some state legislature offer leniency to perpetrators of spousal rape. These legislations typically require the use of physical violence from the perpetrator in order to be considered a felony. Reasons given relate to evidence and the potential for malicious prosecution.\n\nIn the 1984 Virginia Supreme Court Case Weishaupt v. Commonwealth. it states that \"[A] wife can unilaterally revoke her implied consent to marital sex where ... *292 she has made manifest her intent to terminate the marital relationship by living separate and apart from her husband; refraining from voluntary sexual intercourse with her husband; and, in light of all the circumstances, conducting herself in a manner that establishes a de facto end to the marriage.\" This allows the spouse to commit what would be considered rape outside of marriage, inside the confines of the marriage as long as the de facto end of the marriage has not occurred. Again in the Virginia Supreme Court in 1984 Kizer v. Commonwealth upheld the ruling.\n\nIdaho State legislature states, \"No person shall be convicted of rape for any act or acts with that person's spouse…\" unless the perpetrator used physical violence. Similar to Idaho, South Carolina State legislature only considers spousal sexual battery as a felony if \"accomplished through use of aggravated force.\"\n\nOklahoma State Law, being one of the more extreme examples, excludes spousal rape from their definition of rape by claiming, \"Rape is an act of sexual intercourse involving vaginal or anal penetration accomplished with a male or female who is not the spouse of the perpetrator…\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Chretien in Massachusetts in 1981 stated that, \"There was no unfairness in subjecting a defendant to criminal prosecution for rape of his wife under G. L. c. 265, Section 22, as amended by St. 1974, c. 474, Section 1, which this court construes to eliminate the common law spousal exclusion, where the rape occurred after the wife had obtained a judgment of divorce nisi and was therefore unlawful even under the common law.\" They concluded that the husband could be convicted of rape only because the wife had already ordered divorce papers.\n\nSome states however do not offer leniency to perpetrators of spousal rape.\n\nIn State v. Smith 1981 in New Jersey one of the concurring opinions states, \"The statute has never contained any exception or exemption. I would construe it to mean exactly what it says and would hold that a husband who had carnal knowledge of his wife forcibly and against her will was guilty of rape.\" This case affirmed that rape can still take place while a marriage is still ongoing.\n\nSimilarly in People vs. Liberta 1984 in New York, the opinion states about the Marriage Exception, \"This statement is an apt characterization of the marital exemption; it lacks a rational basis, and therefore violates the equal protection clauses of both the Federal and State Constitutions\"\n\nIn the United States, if a person is at risk of death or injury but unconscious or otherwise unable to respond, other people including members of the public and paramedics may assume implied consent to touch the person to provide first aid. Many states have Good Samaritan laws that protect persons giving aid from legal liability, but the type of persons (laypeople versus healthcare professionals) and the amount of protection varies.\n\nStudies have indicated that implied consent is questionable due to the value patients place on being informed on even the simplest procedures being done to them. There are varying events where implied consent can be seen in reproductive healthcare. An example of implied consent being utilized is when complication arise during routine childbirth and actions need to be taken in order to help the mother and fetus. If complications arise during a natural delivery, an emergency cesarean delivery may be performed, even if the mother had previously rejected the option. However this can only occur if the life of the mother or fetus is in danger.\n\nImplied consent is narrow in that \"intervention must be necessary, not merely convenient\". Implied consent in law indicates that \"medical necessity requires a genuine perception of emergency, and a reasonable response\". Some doctors have tried to claim implied consent in the sterilization of women belonging to ethnic minority groups in Europe. This then led to the formation of laws concerning human rights by international treaties and national legislatures that state consent must be given freely by the person in regards to their sterilization.\n\nSome countries have legislation allowing for implied consent for organ donation, asking people to opt out of organ donation instead of opt in, but allow family refusals.\n\n"}

Living with her father after her parents divorced, she studied engineering in the hope of taking over the family air conditioning business. \n\nOn September 19, 1999, Saburido attended a birthday party near Austin, Texas. She and her friends Laura Guerrero, Johan Daal and Johanna Gil decided to drive home after a few hours, and accepted a ride home from classmate Natalia Chpytchak-Bennett. At the same time, Reginald Stephey, an 18-year-old high school student, was driving home alone after drinking beers with his friends at a party. On the outskirts of Austin, Stephey's 1996 GMC Yukon collided head-on with Chpytchak-Bennett's 1990 Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight Regency.\n\nGuerrero and Chpytchak-Bennett were killed instantly, while Gil and Daal suffered minor injuries. Chpytchak-Bennett's Oldsmobile caught fire, and Saburido's feet were trapped under the seat, preventing her from escaping. Fortunately paramedics John McIntosh and Bryan Fitzpatrick happened to be driving past and were flagged down by Stephey. The fire had spread, and the flames were leaping several feet up into the air by the time they arrived. McIntosh put out the fire with his extinguisher, and the two men set about removing everyone from the vehicle. Saburido was still trapped, and Macintosh and Fitzpatrick did not have the necessary equipment to free her. The fire then restarted, forcing McIntosh and Fitzpatrick to retreat. Saburido was inside the car for 45 seconds until a fire truck arrived to extinguish the fire. Saburido was then cut from the car and airlifted to the burn unit in Galveston.\n\nSaburido suffered second and third degree burns to over 60% of her body, but survived despite her doctor's expectations. Her fingers had to be amputated, but there was enough bone left on her thumb to construct an opposable thumb. She lost her hair, ears, nose, lips, left eyelid, and much of her vision. Saburido subsequently underwent more than 120 reconstructive operations, including cornea transplants to restore her left eye.\n\nIn June 2001, Reggie Stephey was convicted on two counts of intoxicated manslaughter. He was sentenced to two concurrent seven-year prison sentences inside Huntsville Unit and fined $20,000.\n\nSaburido and Stephey met for the first time after his trial and conviction in 2001. Saburido has stated that Stephey \"destroyed my life completely,\" but forgave him. Regarding the meeting, Stephey later stated that \"What sticks out in my mind is, 'Reggie, I don't hate you.' It's really touching someone can look you in the eyes and have that much compassion after all that I have caused.\"\n\nSaburido allowed graphic post-accident photographs of herself to be used in the media (posters, TV-commercials, and internet chain mail) to illustrate a possible outcome of drunk driving. She is most well known for a commercial in which she holds a pre-accident photo of herself in front of the camera, which she lowers to reveal her disfigured face and says, \"This is me, after being hit by a drunk driver.\" When asked why she appeared in the campaign, Saburido stated \"I feel very good to do it because I know people can understand a little more what happened to me -- why my life changed completely. So I think for me, for everybody, it's a good opportunity.\"\n\nIn order to ensure the material involving Saburido that was used in an ad campaign by the Texas Department of Transportation could also be used in schools, the videos and photos taken of her involved the use of soft lighting to improve her appearance and consultation with child psychologists to ensure the material, although graphic, would not frighten children.\n\nRegarding her life after the accident, Saburido stated that she has never given up: \"If a person stumbles, he must pick himself up and keep going. I believe this is very important; if not, life would not have much sense.\"\n\nSaburido appeared on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" on November 17, 2003. She was also interviewed on the Australian \"60 Minutes\" on March 14, 2004 and was featured in a Discovery Health documentary on face transplants. She continues to educate people on drunk driving. Oprah Winfrey has called Saburido the one person she had met who defined \"inner beauty\" and that she is \"a woman who defines survival.\"\n\nStephey served his full sentence, having an appeal denied in 2005. He was released from the Huntsville Unit in Texas on June 24, 2008. Saburido stated: \"I don't hate him, I don't feel bad because he's out, he can reconstruct his life again.\" Saburido is currently living in her hometown of Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nOn May 20, 2011, Saburido again appeared on the fourth to last episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", a show dedicated to Oprah's Favorite Guests, including Mattie Stepanek and her \"all-time favorite\" Tererai Trent. During the segment Saburido revealed that as of the taping of that show, she had undergone over 120 surgeries.\n\nSaburido was among 21 disfigured people who had approached surgeons at a London hospital to carry out Britain's first face transplant operation. She is also looking into other possibilities for a face transplant in other nations and hospitals.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "19666626", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19666626", "title": "Lemming", "text": "Lemming\n\nA lemming is a small rodent usually found in or near the Arctic in tundra biomes. They make up the subfamily Arvicolinae (also known as Microtinae) together with voles and muskrats, which forms part of the superfamily Muroidea, which also includes rats, mice, hamsters, and gerbils.\n\nLemmings measure around 13 – 18 centimeters (5 – 7 inches) in length and weigh around 23 – 34 grams (0.05 – 0.07 pounds). Lemmings are quite rounded in shape with brown and black long, soft fur. Lemmings have a very short tail, a stubby, hairy snout, short legs and small ears. They have a flattened claw on their first digit of their front feet which helps them to dig in the snow. They are herbivorous, feeding mostly on moss and grass.They also forage through the snow surface to find berries, leaves, shoots, roots, bulbs and lichen.\nLemmings choose their preferred dietary vegetation disproportionately to its occurrence in their habitat. They digest grasses and sedges less effectively than related voles.\nLike other rodents, their incisors grow continuously, allowing them to exist on much tougher forage.\n\nLemmings do not hibernate through the harsh northern winter. They remain active, finding food by burrowing through the snow. These rodents live in large tunnel systems beneath the snow in winter which protects them from predators. Their underground burrows have rest areas, bathrooms and nesting rooms. Lemmings make nests out of grasses, feathers and musk ox wool. In the spring, they move to higher ground where they live on mountain heaths or in forests, continuously breeding before returning in Autumn to the Alpine zone.\n\nLike many other rodents, lemmings have periodic population booms and then disperse in all directions, seeking the food and shelter their natural habitats cannot provide. The Norway lemming and brown lemming are two of the few vertebrates which reproduce so quickly that their population fluctuations are chaotic, rather than following linear growth to a carrying capacity or regular oscillations. It is not known why lemming populations fluctuate with such great variance roughly every four years, before numbers drop to near extinction. Lemming behavior and appearance are markedly different from those of other rodents, which are inconspicuously colored and try to conceal themselves from their predators. Lemmings, by contrast, are conspicuously colored and behave aggressively towards predators and even human observers. The lemming defense system is thought to be based on aposematism (warning display). Fluctuations in the lemming population affect the behaviour of predators, and may fuel irruptions of birds of prey such as snowy owls to areas further south.\n\nFor many years, the population of lemmings was believed to change with the population cycle, but now some evidence suggests their predators' populations, particularly those of the stoat, may be more closely involved in changing the lemming population.\n\nMisconceptions about lemmings go back many centuries. In the 1530s, geographer Zeigler of Strasbourg proposed the theory that the creatures fell out of the sky during stormy weather and then died suddenly when the grass grew in spring. This description was contradicted by natural historian Ole Worm, who accepted that lemmings could fall out of the sky, but claimed that they had been brought over by the wind rather than created by spontaneous generation. Worm first published dissections of a lemming, which showed that they are anatomically similar to most other rodents such as voles and hamsters, and the work of Carl Linnaeus proved that they had a natural origin.\n\nLemmings have become the subject of a widely popular misconception that they are driven to commit mass suicide when they migrate by jumping off cliffs. It is not a deliberate mass suicide where the animal voluntarily chooses to die, but rather an unfortunate result of their migratory behavior. Driven by strong biological urges, some species of lemmings may migrate in large groups when population density becomes too great. They can swim and may choose to cross a body of water in search of a new habitat. In such cases, many drown if the chosen body of water happens to be the Atlantic Ocean, or is in any case so wide as to exceed their physical capabilities. This, the unexplained fluctuations in the population of Norwegian lemmings, and perhaps a small amount of semantic confusion (suicide not being limited to voluntary deliberation, but also the result of foolishness), gave rise to the myth.\n\nThis urban myth was popularized after this behavior was staged in the Walt Disney documentary \"White Wilderness\" in 1958. However, the animals in the film are not wild animals jumping off the cliff voluntarily, rather they were bought by the producers and pushed over the edge of the cliff. The misconception itself is much older, dating back to at least the late 19th century, where in the 1887 issue of Popular Science Monthly, lemmings are presumed to be swimming the Atlantic Ocean in search of 'the submerged continent of Lemuria'.\n\nThe misconception of lemming \"mass suicide\" is long-standing and has been popularized by a number of factors. It was well enough known to be mentioned in \"The Marching Morons\", a 1951 short story by Cyril M. Kornbluth. In 1955, Disney Studio illustrator Carl Barks drew an Uncle Scrooge adventure comic with the title \"The Lemming with the Locket\". This comic, which was inspired by a 1953 \"American Mercury\" article, showed massive numbers of lemmings jumping over Norwegian cliffs. Even more influential was the 1958 Disney film \"White Wilderness\", which won an Academy Award for Documentary Feature, in which staged footage was shown with lemmings jumping into certain death after faked scenes of mass migration. A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation documentary, \"Cruel Camera\", found the lemmings used for \"White Wilderness\" were flown from Hudson Bay to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where they did not jump off the cliff, but were in fact forced off the cliff by the camera crew. Because of the limited number of lemmings at their disposal, which in any case were the wrong sub-species, the migration scenes were simulated using tight camera angles and a large, snow-covered turntable. Lemmings also appear in Arthur C. Clarke's 1953 short story \"The Possessed\", where their suicidal urges are attributed to the lingering consciousness of an alien group mind which had inhabited the species in the prehistoric past. The concept of lemmings' mass-suicidal tendencies is transferred to human behavior in Richard Matheson's horrific 1953 short-short story, \"Lemmings\".\n\nThis same myth was also used in the Apple Computer 1985 Super Bowl commercial \"Lemmings\" and the popular 1991 video game \"Lemmings\", in which the player must stop the lemmings from mindlessly marching over cliffs or into traps. \n\nBecause of their association with this odd behavior, lemming \"suicide\" is a frequently used metaphor in reference to people who go along unquestioningly with popular opinion, with potentially dangerous or fatal consequences. This metaphor is seen many times in popular culture, such as in the video game \"Lemmings\", in episodes of \"Red Dwarf\", and in Adult Swim's show \"Robot Chicken\". In the eighth episode of season 1 of Showtime's \"The Borgias\", the Pope's second son Juan refers to the college of cardinals as lemmings when they flee the Vatican in anticipation of an impending French invasion. The Blink 182 song \"Lemmings\" also uses this metaphor, as does the unrelated song of the same name by English progressive rock band Van der Graaf Generator (from their 1971 album \"Pawn Hearts\"), and the 1973 stage show \"National Lampoon's Lemmings\" starring John Belushi and mocking post-Woodstock groupthink. In the song \"Synchronicity II\" (from their 1983 album \"Synchronicity\"), The Police compare people in rush hour traffic to lemmings (\"packed like lemmings into shiny metal boxes / contestants in a suicidal race\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "68754", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=68754", "title": "Market failure", "text": "Market failure\n\nIn economics, market failure is a situation in which the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, often leading to a net social welfare loss. Market failures can be viewed as scenarios where individuals' pursuit of pure self-interest leads to results that are not efficient – that can be improved upon from the societal point of view. The first known use of the term by economists was in 1958, but the concept has been traced back to the Victorian philosopher Henry Sidgwick.\nMarket failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, non-competitive markets, principal–agent problems, or externalities. \n\nPublic goods are \"both\" non-rival and non-excludable (i.e., public goods are not only non-excludable) thus existence of a market failure is often the reason that self-regulatory organizations, governments or supra-national institutions intervene in a particular market. Economists, especially microeconomists, are often concerned with the causes of market failure and possible means of correction. Such analysis plays an important role in many types of public policy decisions and studies. However, government policy interventions, such as taxes, subsidies, bailouts, wage and price controls, and regulations, may also lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, sometimes called government failure.\n\nGiven the tension between, on the one hand, the undeniable costs to society caused by market failure, and on the other hand, the potential that attempts to mitigate these costs could lead to costs from \"government failure\", there is sometimes a choice between imperfect outcomes, i.e. imperfect market outcomes with or without government interventions. But either way, if a market failure exists the outcome is not Pareto efficient. Most mainstream economists believe that there are circumstances (like building codes or endangered species) in which it is possible for government or other organizations to improve the inefficient market outcome. Several heterodox schools of thought disagree with this as a matter of principle.\n\nAn \"ecological\" market failure exists when human activity in a market economy is exhausting critical non-renewable resources, disrupting fragile ecosystems services, or overloading biospheric waste absorption capacities. In none of these cases does the criterion of Pareto efficiency obtain.\n\nDifferent economists have different views about what events are the sources of market failure. Mainstream economic analysis widely accepts that a market failure (relative to Pareto efficiency) can occur for three main reasons: if the market is \"monopolised\" or a small group of businesses hold significant market power, if production of the good or service results in an externality, or if the good or service is a \"public good\".\n\nAgents in a market can gain market power, allowing them to block other mutually beneficial gains from trade from occurring. This can lead to inefficiency due to imperfect competition, which can take many different forms, such as monopolies, monopsonies, or monopolistic competition, if the agent does not implement perfect price discrimination. \n\nIt is then a further question about what circumstances allow a monopoly to arise. In some cases, monopolies can maintain themselves where there are \"barriers to entry\" that prevent other companies from effectively entering and competing in an industry or market. Or there could exist significant first-mover advantages in the market that make it difficult for other firms to compete. Moreover, monopoly can be a result of geographical conditions created by huge distances or isolated locations. This leads to a situation where there are only few communities scattered across a vast territory with only one supplier. Australia is an example that meets this description. A natural monopoly is a firm whose per-unit cost decreases as it increases output; in this situation it is most efficient (from a cost perspective) to have only a single producer of a good. Natural monopolies display so-called increasing returns to scale. It means that at all possible outputs marginal cost needs to be below average cost if average cost is declining. One of the reasons is the existence of fixed costs, which must be paid without considering the amount of output, what results in a state where costs are evenly divided over more units leading to the reduction of cost per unit.\n\nSome markets can fail due to the nature of the goods being exchanged. For instance, goods can display the attributes of public goods or common goods, wherein sellers are unable to exclude non-buyers from using a product, as in the development of inventions that may spread freely once revealed. This can cause underinvestment because developers cannot capture enough of the benefits from success to make the development effort worthwhile. This can also lead to resource depletion in the case of common-pool resources, where, because use of the resource is rival but non-excludable, there is no incentive for users to conserve the resource. An example of this is a lake with a natural supply of fish: if people catch the fish faster than they can reproduce, then the fish population will dwindle until there are no fish left for future generations.\n\nA good or service could also have significant externalities, where gains or losses associated with the product, production or consumption of a product, differ from the private cost. These externalities can be innate to the methods of production or other conditions important to the market. \n\nTraffic congestion is an example of market failure that incorporates both non-excludability and externality. Public roads are common resources that are available for the entire population's use (non-excludable), and act as a complement to cars (the more roads there are, the more useful cars become). Because there is very low cost but high benefit to individual drivers in using the roads, the roads become congested, decreasing their usefulness to society. Furthermore, driving can impose hidden costs on society through pollution (externality). Solutions for this include public transportation, congestion pricing, tolls, and other ways of making the driver include the social cost in the decision to drive.\n\nPerhaps the best example of the inefficiency associated with common/public goods and externalities is the environmental harm caused by pollution and overexploitation of natural resources.\n\nSome markets can fail due to the nature of their exchange. Markets may have significant transaction costs, agency problems, or informational asymmetry. Such incomplete markets may result in economic inefficiency but also a possibility of improving efficiency through market, legal, and regulatory remedies. From contract theory, decisions in transactions where one party has more or better information than the other is an asymmetry. This creates an imbalance of power in transactions which can sometimes cause the transactions to go awry. Examples of this problem are adverse selection and moral hazard. Most commonly, information asymmetries are studied in the context of principal–agent problems. George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz developed the idea and shared the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics.\n\nIn \"Models of Man\", Herbert A. Simon points out that most people are only partly rational, and are emotional/irrational in the remaining part of their actions. In another work, he states \"boundedly rational agents experience limits in formulating and solving complex problems and in processing (receiving, storing, retrieving, transmitting) information\" (Williamson, p. 553, citing Simon). Simon describes a number of dimensions along which \"classical\" models of rationality can be made somewhat more realistic, while sticking within the vein of fairly rigorous formalization. These include:\n\n\nSimon suggests that economic agents employ the use of heuristics to make decisions rather than a strict rigid rule of optimization. They do this because of the complexity of the situation, and their inability to process and compute the expected utility of every alternative action. Deliberation costs might be high and there are often other, concurrent economic activities also requiring decisions.\n\nThe Coase theorem, developed by Ronald Coase and labeled as such by George Stigler, states that private transactions are efficient as long as property rights exist, only a small number of parties are involved, and transactions costs are low. Additionally, this efficiency will take place regardless of who owns the property rights. This theory comes from a section of Coase's Nobel prize-winning work \"The Problem of Social Cost\". While the assumptions of low transactions costs and a small number of parties involved may not always be applicable in real-world markets, Coase's work changed the long-held belief that the owner of property rights was a major determining factor in whether or not a market would fail. The Coase theorem points out when one would expect the market to function properly even when there are externalities.\n\nA market is an institution in which individuals or firms exchange not just commodities, but the \"rights\" to use them in particular ways for particular amounts of time. [...] Markets are institutions which organize the \"exchange of control\" of commodities, where the nature of the control is defined by the property rights attached to the commodities.\n\nAs a result, agents' control over the uses of their commodities can be imperfect, because the system of rights which defines that control is incomplete. Typically, this falls into two generalized rights – \"excludability\" and \"transferability\". Excludability deals with the ability of agents to control who uses their commodity, and for how long – and the related costs associated with doing so. Transferability reflects the right of agents to transfer the rights of use from one agent to another, for instance by selling or leasing a commodity, and the costs associated with doing so. If a given system of rights does not fully guarantee these at minimal (or no) cost, then the resulting distribution can be inefficient. Considerations such as these form an important part of the work of institutional economics. Nonetheless, views still differ on whether something displaying these attributes is meaningful without the information provided by the market price system.\n\nMacroeconomic business cycles are a part of the market. They are characterized by constant downswings and upswings which influence economic activity. Therefore, this situation requires some kind of government intervention.\n\nThe above causes represent the mainstream view of what market failures mean and of their importance in the economy. This analysis follows the lead of the neoclassical school, and relies on the notion of Pareto efficiency, which can be in the \"public interest\", as well as in interests of stakeholders with equity. This form of analysis has also been adopted by the Keynesian or new Keynesian schools in modern macroeconomics, applying it to Walrasian models of general equilibrium in order to deal with failures to attain full employment, or the non-adjustment of prices and wages.\n\nPolicies to prevent market failure are already commonly implemented in the economy. For example, to prevent information asymmetry, members of the New York Stock Exchange agree to abide by its rules in order to promote a fair and orderly market in the trading of listed securities. The members of the NYSE presumably believe that each member is individually better off if every member adheres to its rules – even if they have to forego money-making opportunities that would violate those rules.\n\nA simple example of policies to address market power is government antitrust policies. As an additional example of externalities, municipal governments enforce building codes and license tradesmen to mitigate the incentive to use cheaper (but more dangerous) construction practices, ensuring that the total cost of new construction includes the (otherwise external) cost of preventing future tragedies. The voters who elect municipal officials presumably feel that they are individually better off if everyone complies with the local codes, even if those codes may increase the cost of construction in their communities.\n\nCITES is an international treaty to protect the world's common interest in preserving endangered species – a classic \"public good\" – against the private interests of poachers, developers and other market participants who might otherwise reap monetary benefits without bearing the known and unknown costs that extinction could create. Even without knowing the true cost of extinction, the signatory countries believe that the societal costs far outweigh the possible private gains that they have agreed to forego.\n\nSome remedies for market failure can resemble other market failures. For example, the issue of systematic underinvestment in research is addressed by the patent system that creates artificial monopolies for successful inventions.\n\nEconomists such as Milton Friedman from the Chicago school and others from the Public Choice school, argue that market failure does not necessarily imply that the government should attempt to solve market failures, because the costs of government failure might be worse than those of the market failure it attempts to fix. This failure of government is seen as the result of the inherent problems of democracy and other forms of government perceived by this school and also of the power of special-interest groups (rent seekers) both in the private sector and in the government bureaucracy. Conditions that many would regard as negative are often seen as an effect of subversion of the free market by coercive government intervention. Beyond philosophical objections, a further issue is the practical difficulty that any single decision maker may face in trying to understand (and perhaps predict) the numerous interactions that occur between producers and consumers in any market.\n\nSome advocates of \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, including many economists of the Austrian School, argue that there is no such phenomenon as \"market failure\". Israel Kirzner states that, \"Efficiency for a social system means the efficiency with which it permits its individual members to achieve their individual goals.\" Inefficiency only arises when means are chosen by individuals that are inconsistent with their desired goals. This definition of efficiency differs from that of Pareto efficiency, and forms the basis of the theoretical argument against the existence of market failures. However, providing that the conditions of the first welfare theorem are met, these two definitions agree, and give identical results. Austrians argue that the market tends to eliminate its inefficiencies through the process of entrepreneurship driven by the profit motive; something the government has great difficulty detecting, or correcting.\n\nObjections also exist on more fundamental bases, such as that of equity, or Marxian analysis. Colloquial uses of the term \"market failure\" reflect the notion of a market \"failing\" to provide some desired attribute different from efficiency – for instance, high levels of inequality can be considered a \"market failure\", yet are not Pareto inefficient, and so would not be considered a market failure by mainstream\neconomics. In addition, many Marxian economists would argue that the system of individual property rights is a fundamental problem in itself, and that resources should be allocated in another way entirely. This is different from concepts of \"market failure\" which focuses on specific situations – typically seen as \"abnormal\" – where markets have inefficient outcomes. Marxists, in contrast, would say that markets have inefficient and democratically unwanted outcomes – viewing market failure as an inherent feature of any capitalist economy – and typically omit it from discussion, preferring to ration finite goods not exclusively through a price mechanism, but based upon need as determined by society expressed through the community.\n\nIn ecological economics, the concept of externalities is considered a misnomer, since market agents are viewed as making their incomes and profits by systematically 'shifting' the social and ecological costs of their activities onto other agents, including future generations. Hence, externalities is a \"modus operandi\" of the market, not a failure: The market cannot exist without constantly 'failing'.\n\nThe fair and even allocation of non-renewable resources over time is a market failure issue of concern to ecological economics. This issue is also known as 'intergenerational fairness'. It is argued that the market mechanism fails when it comes to allocating the Earth's finite mineral stock fairly and evenly among present and future generations, as future generations are not, and cannot be, present on today's market. In effect, today's market prices do not, and cannot, reflect the preferences of the yet unborn. This is an instance of a market failure passed unrecognized by most mainstream economists, as the concept of Pareto efficiency is entirely static (timeless). Imposing government restrictions on the general level of activity in the economy may be the only way of bringing about a more fair and even intergenerational allocation of the mineral stock. Hence, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly, the two leading theorists in the field, have both called for the imposition of such restrictions: Georgescu-Roegen has proposed a minimal bioeconomic program, and Daly has proposed a comprehensive steady-state economy. However, Georgescu-Roegen, Daly, and other economists in the field agree that on a finite Earth, geologic limits will inevitably strain most fairness in the longer run, regardless of any present government restrictions: \"Any\" rate of extraction and use of the finite stock of non-renewable mineral resources will diminish the remaining stock left over for future generations to use. \n\nAnother ecological market failure is presented by the overutilisation of an otherwise renewable resource at a point in time, or within a short period of time. Such overutilisation usually occurs when the resource in question has poorly defined (or non-existing) property rights attached to it while too many market agents engage in activity simultaneously for the resource to be able to sustain it all. Examples range from over-fishing of fisheries and over-grazing of pastures to over-crowding of recreational areas in congested cities. This type of ecological market failure is generally known as the 'tragedy of the commons'. In this type of market failure, the principle of Pareto efficiency is violated the utmost, as \"all\" agents in the market are left worse off, while nobody are benefitting. It has been argued that the best way to remedy a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure is to establish enforceable property rights politically – only, this may be easier said than done.\n\nThe issue of anthropogenic global warming presents an overwhelming example of a 'tragedy of the commons'-type of ecological market failure: The Earth's atmosphere may be regarded as a 'global common' exhibiting poorly defined (non-existing) property rights, and the waste absorption capacity of the atmosphere with regard to carbon dioxide is presently being heavily overloaded by a too large volume of emissions from the world economy. Historically, the fossil fuel dependence of the Industrial Revolution has unintentionally thrown mankind out of ecological equilibrium with the rest of the Earth's biosphere (including the atmosphere), and the market has failed to correct the situation ever since. Quite the opposite: The unrestricted market has been exacerbating this global state of ecological \"dis\"-equilibrium, and is expected to continue doing so well into the foreseeable future. This particular market failure may be remedied to some extent at the political level by the establishment of an international (or regional) cap and trade property rights system, where carbon dioxide emission permits are bought and sold among market agents.\n\nThe term 'uneconomic growth' describes a pervasive ecological market failure: The ecological costs of further economic growth in a so-called 'full-world economy' like the present world economy may exceed the immediate social benefits derived from this growth.\n\nChang states that \"it is (implicitly) assumed the state knows everything and can do everything.” Thus, this implies several assumptions about government in relation to market failures. There are three main statements. First of all, government representatives are able to evaluate the scope of market failures and to what extent it differs from efficient outcome. Secondly, having acquired the aforementioned knowledge they have capacity to re-establish market efficiency. Lastly, there has arisen an idea according to which decisions of policy-makers are not influenced by self-interest, but they are driven by altruism.\n\nThey came up with the theory of the so-called the “second best.” They refuse Chang's theory and state that is it not possible to restore Pareto optimality even if policy makers possess the sufficient knowledge, intervene efficiently and altruism serves as stimulus for their decisions. On the other hand, the “second best” theory holds that when market failure occurs in one branch of the economy, it should be feasible to increase social welfare in another branch of the economy by violating Pareto efficiency instead of restoring Pareto efficiency by government intervention.\n\nZerbe and McCurdy connected criticism of market failure paradigm to transaction costs. Market failure paradigm is defined as follows:\n\n\"A fundamental problem with the concept of market failure, as economists occasionally recognize, is that it describes a situation that exists everywhere.”\n\nTransaction costs are part of each market exchange, although the price of transaction costs is not usually determined. They occur everywhere and are unpriced. Consequently, market failures and externalities can arise in the economy every time transaction costs arise. There is no place for government intervention. Instead, government should focus on the elimination of both transaction costs and costs of provision.\n\n\n"}

He was also charged in the deaths of an additional twenty women, many of them from Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. These charges were, however, stayed by the Crown in 2010. In December 2007, he was sentenced to life in prison, with no possibility of parole for 25 years. It was the longest sentence then available under Canadian law for murder.\n\nFollowing Pickton's arrest, there was increased attention was given to a prior attempted murder charge of a sex worker in March 1997. Pickton was alleged to have stabbed her several times during an altercation at the farm. The victim informed police that Pickton had handcuffed her, but that she escaped after suffering several lacerations, disarming him, and stabbing him with his weapon. The charge was dismissed in January 1998. The mandate of the commission included evaluating why the 1997 charges against Pickton were stayed.\n\nThe Missing Women Commission of Inquiry had four mandates:\n\n\nIn 2012, the Commission issued a final report which included a number of recommendations. The commission closed its office on August 1 of the following year.\n\nThe high profile of the BC investigation caused other Canadian jurisdictions to create new task forces to deal with missing persons cold cases. Often these cases involve marginalized women, including sex workers, drug users, and Aboriginals. In Manitoba, Project Devote was looking for 28 people . Since 2003, Project KARE has been looking for \"cases of murdered or missing high risk persons from all parts of Alberta\".\n\nHuman rights organizations the B.C. Civil Liberties Association, Pivot Legal Society and West Coast LEAF have condemned the inquiry for its failure to include the voices of marginalized women. 15 groups representing the interests of marginalized people were initially granted standing at the inquiry but pulled out of the process in protest after being denied funding.\n\n\n"}

The start takes place at midnight, exactly at the beginning of the New Year. Start and finish are located in Schlieren near Zurich in Switzerland. The track consists of four laps along the river Limmat. Besides the marathon, there are also a half marathon (two laps), a quarter marathon (one lap) as well as a marathon relay. The start of the marathon and the finish area of all races are located inside a sports hall. The participants run through the sports hall after each lap. The race is subject to a time limit of 5 hours, being extended in case of bad conditions (snow, ice).\n\nSince 2014 there is also a kids marathon on a 750 meters track, which starts at 10 p.m. on 31 December. This race is free of charge for all participants.\n\nAll courses of the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich are officially measured according to the rules of IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations). As one of only seven Swiss road races it is part of the AIMS (Association of International Marathons and Distance Races), which implies that the times run are accepted officially by IAAF. The other Swiss AIMS events are the Zürich Marathon, the Zermatt-Marathon, the Swiss Alpine Marathon, the Jungfrau-Marathon, the Swiss City Marathon and the Lausanne Marathon. Thanks to its starting time at the very first second of the year, the Neujahrsmarathon Zurich is the first AIMS running event of the year, and hence the performances of the winners automatically qualify as first official world record times of the year. This possibility to run an official record time of the year for the home country attracts runners from about 50 different countries from all continents.\n\nThe Neujahrsmarathon Zürich is organized by the \"Verein Neujahrsmarathon Zürich\", a non-profit association founded in 2004. In the association's standing rules the intended purpose is described as: \"The association aims to foster and promote the sport of running. In particular, the association organizes each New Year's Eve the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich. The association does not pursue commercial purposes and does not seek profit.\"\n\nThe latter is reflected directly in the entry fee of the Neujahrsmarathon Zürich.

{"id": "303799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=303799", "title": "Peter Popoff", "text": "Peter Popoff\n\nPeter Popoff (born July 2, 1946) is a German-born televangelist. He was exposed in 1986 for using an earpiece to receive radio messages from his wife, who gave him the names, addresses and ailments of audience members during Popoff-led religious services. Popoff falsely claimed God revealed this information to him so that Popoff could cure them by faith healing.\n\nHe went bankrupt the next year, but made a comeback in the late 1990s. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Popoff bought TV time to promote \"Miracle Spring Water\" on late-night infomercials, and referred to himself as a prophet. \"Business Insider\" remarked: \"No matter how many times his claims are debunked, he seems to bounce back with another version of the same old scam.\"\n\nPopoff was born in occupied Berlin (West Berlin) on July 2, 1946, to George and Gerda Popoff. As a child, Popoff emigrated with his family to the United States, where he attended Chaffey College before transferring to the University of California, Santa Barbara, from which he graduated in 1970.\n\nPopoff's father preached at revival meetings throughout the United States. Beginning in 1960, Popoff also began making appearances as a preacher. Billed as \"The Miracle Boy Evangelist\" in print advertisements, the ads also claimed he was born in a West Berlin bomb shelter, and had been rescued from a Siberian prison camp. The powers he claimed included the abilities to heal the sick and foretell the future.\n\nPopoff married his wife Elizabeth in 1970 and the couple settled in Upland, California. He then began his television ministry that, by the early 1980s, was being broadcast nationally. His miraculous \"curing\" of chronic and incurable medical conditions became a central attraction of his sermons. Popoff would tell attendees suffering from a variety of illnesses to \"break free of the devil\" by throwing their prescription pills onto the stage. Many would obey, tossing away bottles of digitalis, nitroglycerine, and other important maintenance medications. Popoff would also \"command\" supplicants in wheelchairs to \"rise and break free\". They would stand and walk without assistance, to the joyous cheers of the faithful. Critics later documented that the recipients of these dramatic \"cures\" were fully ambulatory people who had been seated in wheelchairs by Popoff's assistants prior to broadcasts.\n\nIn 1985 Popoff began soliciting donations for a program to provide Bibles to citizens of the Soviet Union by attaching them to helium-filled balloons and floating them into the country. When skeptics asked him to prove that the money he had collected had in fact been spent on Bibles and balloons, Popoff staged a burglary at his own headquarters. On subsequent broadcasts he tearfully begged for additional donations to help repair the damage.\n\nAt the height of his popularity in the 1980s, Popoff would accurately announce home addresses and specific illnesses of audience members during his \"healing sermons\", a feat that he implied was due to divine revelation and \"God-given ability\". In 1986, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry charged that Popoff was using electronic transmissions to receive his information; Popoff denied it, insisting that the messages were divinely revealed. Skeptic groups distributed pamphlets explaining how Popoff's feats could be accomplished without any sort of divine intervention. Popoff branded his critics \"tools of the devil\".\n\nPopoff's methods were definitively exposed in 1986 by the magician and skeptic James Randi and his associate Steve Shaw, an illusionist known professionally as Banachek, with technical assistance from the crime scene analyst and electronics expert Alexander Jason. With computerized radio scanners, Jason was able to demonstrate that Popoff's wife, Elizabeth, was using a wireless radio transmitter to broadcast information that she and her aides had culled from prayer request cards filled out by audience members. Popoff received the transmissions via an earpiece he was wearing and repeated the information to astonished audience members. Jason produced video segments interspersing the intercepted radio transmissions with Popoff's \"miraculous\" pronouncements.\n\nRandi also planted accomplices in Popoff's audiences, including a man dressed as a woman, at a meeting in Detroit in 1984, whom Popoff \"cured\" of uterine cancer. Randi and Shaw recorded Elizabeth describing a woman to Popoff as \"that big nigger in the back\", and warning him, \"Keep your hands off those tits ... I'm watching you.\" At another session, Elizabeth and her aides were heard laughing uncontrollably at the physical appearance of a man suffering from advanced testicular cancer.\n\nIn May 1986, Randi presented one of Jason's videos on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\". Popoff initially denied Randi's accusations and accused NBC of \"...[hiring] an actress to impersonate Mrs. Popoff on a doctored videotape\". Eventually Popoff admitted the existence of the radio device, but claimed that Elizabeth only \"occasionally\" gave him \"the name of a person who needs special prayers\". He added that \"almost everybody\" knew about the wireless communication system. His ministry's viewer ratings and donations declined significantly after the Carson airing, and in September 1987 he declared bankruptcy, listing more than 790 unpaid creditors. Popoff's attorney, William Simon, \"attributed the collapse of his ministry to financial mismanagement more than to disclosures about Popoff.\" Jason's video footage was also aired on the \"NOVA\" episode \"Secrets of the Psychics\" in 1991. The episode was released on video as part of a lesson in critical thinking.\n\nA former associate of Popoff from 1965 to 1990 said, \"When you're praying for the sick, it's through the Holy Spirit, and there's some times that it works freely, and then there are other times when the Spirit's just not there.\" He went on to say that on the days it didn't show, you still had to pay for the auditorium so you needed to help the Holy Spirit along.\n\nIn 1998, \"The Washington Post\" reported that Popoff was making a comeback, seeking to jump-start his ministry by repackaging himself for an African-American audience, buying time on the Black Entertainment Television network. Popoff, along with Don Stewart and Robert Tilton, received \"criticism from those who say that preachers with a long trail of disillusioned followers have no place on a network that holds itself out as a model of entrepreneurship for the black community\".\n\nA February 2007 \"Inside Edition\" segment reported that Popoff's new infomercials depict him \"healing the sick\" in a manner identical to his methods prior to James Randi's exposé. Victims were interviewed, including a married couple who charged that Popoff had taken \"thousands of dollars\" from them. Popoff refused to comment. \"Flim flam is his profession,\" Randi explained to reporter Matt Meaghan. \"That's what he does best. He's very good at it, and naturally he's going to go back to it.\" In May 2007, ABC's \"20/20\" focused on Popoff's comeback and explored the lives of a few people who felt cheated. Various other media outlets have run similar stories. In July 2008, a Nanaimo, British Columbia resident was reimbursed by Popoff after she went public with her concerns over his fundraising tactics.\n\nIn 2008, the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom issued strong warnings to broadcasters for transmitting Popoff's material, which the regulator felt promoted his products \"in such a way as to target potential susceptible and vulnerable viewers\". These programs included offers of free \"Miracle Manna\" that allegedly provided health and financial miracles. In 2009, Popoff began running advertisements in UK periodicals offering a free cross containing \"blessed water\" and \"holy sand\". The water, he claimed, was drawn from a spring near Chernobyl (site of the 1986 nuclear reactor disaster). Animals and humans drinking from the spring were purportedly spared radiation sickness. Responders to the ad received a small wooden cross bearing the inscription \"Jerusalem\" and a solicitation for donations, followed by numerous additional solicitation letters.\n\nPopoff was designated by the James Randi Educational Foundation (JREF) as one of its recipients of the 2011 Pigasus Award for fraudulent practices, along with Mehmet Oz (from \"The Dr. Oz Show\") and CVS Pharmacy. \"Debt cancellation is part of God's plan\", according to Popoff, who teaches that God will respond to prayer and seed-faith by providing financial blessing. Credit.com wrote a blog post concerning Popoff's claims.\n\nIn September 2015, Michael Marshall of the Good Thinking Society documented Popoff's latest promises of \"fabulous extreme fortune\" and \"miracles\" in exchange for donations to his organization. At a recent London gathering, GTS filmed Popoff \"healing\" a woman supposedly \"wracked with pain\", though Marshall and a colleague had previously seen her—in no obvious distress—handing out pens and questionnaires to audience members. Soon after the \"healing\", they watched her quietly leave the room.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Popoff began to offer \"Miracle Spring Water\" on late-night infomercials in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. Respondents are promised miraculous protection from disease and disability, along with financial prosperity (which may include \"divine money transfers directly into your account\"), if they sleep with the water for one night before drinking it, then pray over the empty packet and send it back to Popoff—with a donation. Multiple solicitation letters follow, requesting more donations in exchange for miracles.\n\nPopoff also started referring to himself as a prophet.\n\nPopoff's operation had functioned as a religious nonprofit until 2006, when it merged with a small church in Farmers Branch, Texas called Word for the World, which operated out of a storefront. By being classified as a church, the operation no longer had to report annual income or salary to the IRS. When a reporter from \"GQ\" attempted to visit this church on a Sunday morning in late 2016, he found a deserted parking lot in an industrial park with no church sign visible on the outside.\n\nBecause of Popoff's history of fraud and financial irregularities, his \"People United For Christ\" organization earned a \"Did Not Disclose\" rating with the Better Business Bureau, indicating its refusal to provide information that would enable BBB to determine whether the group adheres to its Standards for Charity Accountability. \n\nPopoff's longtime assistants Reeford and Pamela Sherrell also began a televised Texas-based ministry, with Reeford using the name Pastor Lee Sherrell. Like Popoff, they use the offer of a religious trinket (a free prayer cloth) to compile an address list. Once a follower requests the prayer cloth and inputs his or her address, letters asking for money are dispatched.\n\nResearcher and bioethics expert Fred M. Frohock cited Popoff as \"one of many egregious instances of fake healing.\" Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation, founded in 1987 to research the claims of televangelists, said, \"Most of these guys are fooled by their own theology\", referring to other televangelists such as Joel Osteen and T. D. Jakes, but in the case of Popoff, \"He's fundamentally evil, because he \"knows\" he's a con man\", Anthony said.\n\nPopoff was collecting almost $4 million per year in the late 1980s, according to Randi. In 2003, his ministry received over $9.6 million, and in 2005, over $23 million. In that year, he and his wife were paid a combined salary of nearly $1 million, while two of his children received over $180,000 each. Financial data is not available for Popoff's ministry since 2005 because Peter Popoff Ministries changed from a for-profit business to a religious organization in 2006, making it tax-exempt. Popoff purchased a home in Bradbury, California, for $4.5 million in 2007. He drives a Porsche and a Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe 1992 Steve Martin dramedy \"Leap of Faith\" was inspired by Popoff's fraudulent ministry, and demonstrated a number of the techniques Popoff and other televangelist scammers use to create the illusion of divine intervention. A 2012 Broadway musical adaptation of the same title was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical.\n\nPopoff was also the inspiration for a character in the 2012 thriller film \"Red Lights\", a psychic who uses information fed to him via a hidden earpiece to persuade the audience at his shows that he is receiving personal details psychically. The script includes Elizabeth Popoff's infamous line, \"Hello Petey, can you hear me? If you can't, you're in trouble\", almost verbatim.\n\n\nBroadcasters airing his TV program include: AMC, WITI, WNYW, WWOR-TV, The Word Network (US); VisionTV (Canada), and WGN-TV.\n\n\nOfficial and critical\n"}

The cemetery was established in 1874 when Senator Charles Maclay created the Township of San Fernando. The last burial was most likely in 1939. It was known at the time as the San Fernando Cemetery and also as the Morningside Cemetery and is the oldest non-denominational cemetery in the San Fernando Valley. The area's oldest cemetery being the San Fernando Mission Cemetery, which began operating in approximately 1800.\n\nUntil recently, it was erroneously thought that over 700 residents were buried there between approximately 1892 and 1939. Due to heavy vandalism, there are only 13 tombstones remaining. After the cemetery was determined to be legally abandoned in 1959, it was acquired by the Native Daughters of the Golden West, San Fernando Mission Chapter #280, renamed and maintained as a pioneer memorial park. Edith Reber, a longtime resident of Sylmar and an active member of the Chamber, for many years ran a volunteer effort to maintain the grounds with the help of local volunteer groups. In 2002, the Native Daughters gave the cemetery to the San Fernando Valley Historical Society. The Society has made many improvements to the property, including installing a memorial brick entrance and opening the cemetery to the public one day a month on the third Saturday. The Society also commissioned a ground penetrating radar survey in 2010 that located only 214 gravesites, which scientifically contradicted the long-standing belief that more graves were present. While ground penetrating radar may not be infallible, the likelihood that over 700 people were buried there is slim. Through volunteer researchers, nearly 200 death certificates citing Morningside Cemetery have been located. The Society continues to do research in an effort to correct the historical inaccuracies which unfortunately continue to be repeated by media, amateur historians, gravers, and others interested in the old cemetery. It is located on what is currently the corner of Foothill Boulevard and Bledsoe Street.\n\nIt was listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1993. As \"San Fernando Cemetery\", it is a California Historical Landmark.\n\n\n"}

Up until 1972 the series was open to Group E Series Production Touring Cars and from 1973 onwards, like the Bathurst 1000 endurance race, it was switched to the new Australian Group C Touring Car regulations. The position of the series on the Australian racing calendar meant that it was the first title to be contested by the Chrysler, Ford and Holden teams each year. \n\nA Manufacturers Trophy was awarded in addition to a drivers title in 1970 and 1971.

In addition to sports venues and performing arts venues, many other venues that require clear audience views of a single area use stadium seating, including religious institutions, lecture halls, and movie theaters.\n\nAn alternative to stadium seating is to place the focal area at a higher level than the audience, so that the audience may look above those people in front of them to see, (like the green circle in the illustration, right), avoiding blocked sight-lines . One example of this is floor seating of a music venue which has a raised stage; seats are commonly all at an equal height on the actual floor of a venue, such as the floor seats at a concert held in a sports arena.\n\nBecause the increased angle of stadium seating, seats are typically (but not universally) installed on a stepped floor surface which also functions as a staircase in the aisles. This is as opposed to the common usage of a flat, often slightly sloped, floor used in many standard seating venues (such as many stage theaters). There has been some criticism of stadium seating because, due to the stepped layout, it is usually not possible for disabled people in wheelchairs to move about. Venues with stadium seating generally place handicapped seating among the row which is at the level of the concourse which feeds the seating area, leaving more space than rows above or below it, and leaving chair-less space(s) for wheelchairs.\n\nThe trains on some roller coasters are also configured in tiers; this seating configuration is also sometimes called stadium seating. Three prominent examples of roller coasters whose trains use this type of seating are Millennium Force at Cedar Point, which opened in 2000, SheiKra at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, which opened in 2005, and Griffon at Busch Gardens Williamsburg, which opened in 2007.\n\nConverting sloped-floor theaters to stadium seating often requires raising the ceiling and adding risers, so owners of movie theaters often judge conversion as not cost effective.\n\n"}
{"id": "4337630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4337630", "title": "Teatro El Círculo", "text": "Teatro El Círculo\n\nTeatro El Círculo is a theater in Rosario, Argentina.\n\nIt is located near the historical center of the city, at the intersection of Laprida and Mendoza Streets. Planned as a lyric theater, it was developed as \"Teatro La Ópera\" by Emilio O. Schiffner, who purchased the society of the same name in 1889. Schiffner contracted German engineer George Goldammer, an acoustician who modified the original design, and the construction firm of Bianchi, Vila y Compañía. Following delays caused by the Panic of 1890, as well as the earlier society's debts, the theatre was started in 1903. Italian artists, directed by Luggi Levoni, decorated both the interiors and exteriors; among their notable creations was the stage curtain designed by Giuseppe Carmignani with images from Greek mythology similar to those found in the Teatro Regio di Parma. Teatro La Ópera was inaugurated on June 4, 1904, with the performance of Giuseppe Verdi's \"Otello\".\n\nThe theater received many artists from around the world, including opera singers, ballets, and orchestras. Enrico Caruso performed there in 1915, and compared its acoustic quality to that of the Metropolitan Opera House in New York.\n\nAfter this phase of splendor, the theater began to decay, and by 1940 its demolition was being actively considered by the city. The abandoned catacombs underneath the theatre were converted into the Museum of Sacred Art in 1940 to house the prolific work of sculptor Eduardo Barnes. A cultural association known \"El Círculo de la Biblioteca\" (The Library Circle), who previously gathered at the Biblioteca Argentina and needed another place for their meetings, acquired the building in 1943, preserved it, and changed its name to the present one.\n\nThe theater has a capacity of 1,450 people, in five levels. It currently functions mostly as a cultural center. It was fully restored for its 100th anniversary in 2004, and served as a stage for the Third International Congress of the Spanish Language. The sidewalks and the two streets around the corner of the theater were turned into a sort of plaza with an early 20th-century look, using old lampposts and replacing the usual asphalted surface with cobblestones.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "44542278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44542278", "title": "The Game Awards", "text": "The Game Awards\n\nThe Game Awards is an annual awards ceremony honoring achievements in the video game industry. The ceremonies also feature premieres of new games and upcoming content and an in-depth look at previously announced ones. The shows are produced and hosted by Canadian games journalist Geoff Keighley, who had worked on its predecessor, the Spike Video Game Awards, for over ten years.\n\nIn 1994, Geoff Keighley had been a part of the first televised awards show for video games, \"Cybermania '94: The Ultimate Gamer Awards\". Keighley, as a teenager, had been brought on to help write material for the celebrity hosts such as William Shatner and Leslie Neilson. The show was not considered successful, aimed more for comedy than celebration, but from it, Keighley had been prompted to develop something akin to the Academy Awards for video games later in his career.\n\nKeighley had subsequently worked on the Spike Video Game Awards (abbreviated VGA), which ran from 2003 to 2013. The show, was broadcast on Spike TV near the end of each calendar year, was designed to honor video games released during that year. Keighley served as the producer and often host for these shows. In 2013, Spike opted to rename the awards from VGA to VGX as to reflect that they wanted to focus more on next-generation games that were being ushered in by the onset of the eighth generation of consoles, as well as bringing comedian Joel McHale to co-host alongside Keighley. The 2013 show was considered to be disappointing and aimed as a more commercial work rather than a celebration of video game achievements.\n\nKeighley was disappointed with the change in tone that this show has presented. He opted to drop out from further involvement in the VGX, allowing Spike to retain ownership of the property; in November 2014, Spike TV announced that they had opted to drop the awards show in its entirety. Instead, Keighley worked with several entities within the industry, including console hardware manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo, and several large publishers, to financially back and craft a new awards show, the Game Awards, with Spike's blessing. Keighley was able to secure space for hosting the live event. Without a broadcaster, Keighley and the entities agreed to stream the live show on the consoles' networks and on Valve Corporation's Steam service, as to be able to reach a much larger audience than Spike TV previously had. Since then, Keighley has been able to secure multiple streaming services around the globe for the show, which has been a move appreciated by several of the Game Awards' partners since the show's inception.\n\nKeighley considered it important that the Game Awards presentation is aimed to favorably present the interest of gamers and of the industry, and to be welcoming to celebrities and others that have shown interest in video games. While the Game Awards are principally an awards show, Keighley knew the importance of having additional content, having seen other experiments of video game awards shows that were only dedicated to awards fail due to lack of audience. Keighley believed that the Game Awards should fall somewhere between the entertainment venues that are used for the Academy Awards, and the standard award presentation used for the Game Developers Choice Awards, and wanted a balance of material. Through the Spike VGX and into the Game Awards, Keighley has engaged with developers and publishers to bring teaser trailers, sneak peaks, and reveals of upcoming games alongside the awards. He considers the crowning moment of this approach was being able to secure the first gameplay reveal of \"\" for the 2014 Game Awards. Keighly encourages developers and publishers to provide any content that might be deemed existing or that can pique interest, even if these games are at an early stage of development, and then makes the selection of which games and trailers to feature.\n\nIn conjunction with the Awards presentation, several digital storefronts, such as Steam, the Xbox Live Marketplace and the PlayStation Store offer the nominated games on sale leading up to and a few days after the presentation. The statuette awarded to the selected games was designed by collaboration between Keighley and Weta Workshop. It is meant to represent \"the evolution of the video game medium by way of an angel that ascends through digital building blocks\".\n\nThe Game Awards has an advisory committee which includes representatives from hardware manufacturers Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, and AMD, and software publishers Electronic Arts, Activision, Rockstar Games, Ubisoft, Valve, and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. This committee selects around thirty influential video game news organizations that will be able to nominate and subsequently vote on the video games in several categories. The advisory committee otherwise does not participate in the nomination or voting process. During the nomination round, each of the news outlets provides a list of games in several categories; games for the esports-related categories are chosen by a specific subset of these outlets. The committee compiles the nominations and selects the most-nominated titles for voting by these same outlets. Prior to 2017, there were 28 industry experts and representatives that selected the winners, while the awards from 2017 onwards have used over 50 such experts.\n\nThe 2014 ceremony took place at The AXIS on December 5, 2014.\n\nThe 2015 ceremony took place at the Microsoft Theater on December 3, 2015.\n\nThe 2016 ceremony took place at the Microsoft Theater on December 1, 2016.\n\nThe Game Awards 2017 took place at the Microsoft Theater on December 7, 2017.\n\n\nThe Game Awards 2018 are scheduled to take place at the Microsoft Theater on December 6, 2018.\n"}

Most take place in the Muslim-majority, contested provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala in the far south of Thailand bordering Muslim Malaysia.\n\nFor earlier events see History of Thailand.\n\nAlthough the conflict was carried out with less intensity, armed resistance in the 1960s and 1970s involved up to 1,500 insurgents.\n\n1960: The Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) was founded by Haji Abdul Karim in response to the introduction of a secular curriculum in Pattani's religious boarding schools.\n\n1968: Patani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) was founded by Tengku Bira Kotanila (alias Kabir Abdul Rahman). PULO became the most powerful insurgent group during the 1960 – 2000 period of the war.\n\n11 December 1975: PULO organised mass protests in response to the event, which were joined by 70,000 Malay Muslims. A bomb was thrown into the crowd killing 12 and injuring at least 30 protesters. The attack was blamed on Buddhist extremists.\n\nThe government charged and imprisoned the perpetrators and launched an official inquiry and compensated the families of the victims. Despite the fact that the majority of the protesters demands were granted, the event led to an escalation of the insurgency.\n\nJune 1977: Sabilillah (Path of God) bombed Don Mueang International Airport in Bangkok. In the aftermath of the bombing Sabilillah vanished into obscurity.\n\nSeptember 1977: Black December 1902 members threw a bomb into a Thai royal ceremony. Five persons were killed and 47 wounded. The royal family managed to escape unharmed.\n\n1977: Security forces killed BNPP leader Tunku Yala Nasae.\n\n\n1993: The New PULO, a dissident faction of the original PULO, was established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo.\n\n1995: Nasoree Saesang founded the GMIP.\n\nAugust 1996: Thirty-six schools were torched in Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat allegedly by members of the New PULO faction, reportedly a dissident faction of the original PULO established by Arrong Moo-reng and Hayi Abdul Rohman Bazo. The Thai Interior Ministry and Thai Military Intelligence reported that New PULO used unemployed youth and young drug addicts to carry out its terrorist missions.\n\n1997: Members of the Barisan Revolusi Nasional Melayu Patani (BRN), PULO and the New PULO established the United Mujahideen Front of Pattani to improve co-ordination between rebel factions.\n\nAugust 1997: Bersatu launched an operation code named \"Falling Leaves\". Between August 1997 and January 1998, 33 separate attacks took place resulting in nine deaths.\n\nJanuary 1998: Malaysia and Thailand launched a joint operation code named \"Pitak Tai\" to crack down on insurgent outfits. Malaysian authorities arrested New PULO's leader,Abdul Rohman Bazo, its military chief, Haji Daoh Thanam, and Bazo's senior assistant, Haji Mae Yala in Kedah, as well as PULO's military commander, Haji Sama-ae Thanam, in Kuala Lumpur, later handing them to Thai authorities. The Thai government also encouraged local people to monitor the movements of drug traffickers and, as a result, the tough policy on drugs deprived PULO of recruits for its acts of terror.\n\n\n24 December 2001: Insurgents launched a number of attacks on police posts in the three provinces. Five police and one defence volunteer were killed.\n\n\n\n4 January: An escalation of the violence in the southern border provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat is reckoned to have begun on 4 January 2004 with the raiding of a Thai Army depot. Unidentified gunmen raided an army ammunition depot in Narathiwat Province in the early morning, and made off with over 400 rifles and ammunition.\n\n5 January: Two policemen were killed while attempting to defuse a bomb outside a shopping mall in Pattani. A third policeman was injured in bomb blast that occurred in a nearby park. Two more bombs were successfully defused in nearby areas. Prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra declared martial law in the provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala.\n\n22 January: Rebels killed a Buddhist monk.\n\n12 March: Somchai Neelapaijit, a Thai-Muslim lawyer and human rights activist, was abducted in Ramkhamhaeng, Bangkok. He represented Muslim defendants, who said they had been tortured, in terrorism cases. He was never seen again.\n\n28 March: A bomb planted by insurgents injured 29 people, including 10 Malaysian tourists.\n\n30 March: Masked men raided a quarry in the Yala District, stealing a total of 1.6 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, 56 sticks of dynamite, and 176 detonators.\n\n23 April: Militants killed an army officer and set fire to 50 public buildings in all 13 districts of Narathiwat Province.\n\n28 April: Militants launched a string of attacks on armouries and army positions in Pattani, Yala, and Songkhla. One-hundred eight rebels were killed in the aftermath of the attacks.\n\n10 June: Militants killed a security guard outside a government school and seized weapons from other security personnel who were inside.\n\n25 October: Seventy-eight persons were killed by Thai police in the aftermath of a riot over the detentions of Muslims suspected of giving weapons to Islamic separatists. Over 1,300 people were detained in the incident.\n\n28 October: An IED detonated outside a bar, killing two persons and injuring 21.\n\n2 November: A Buddhist official was beheaded by suspected Muslim insurgents.\n\n4 November: Nine persons were killed including two police.\n\n7 November: The Defence Minister of Thailand said that there had been more than 700 casualties in south Thailand since the unrest began in January. Many murders involved shooting and decapitation. During 2004, insurgents began to sow fear in attacks by beheading Buddhists.\n\n13 November: One man was killed and at least 13 people injured when five bomb blasts occurred in various parts of the region.\n\n5 December: Thailand airdropped nearly 100 million origami cranes over the southern regions of the country in an effort to bring peace. Militants respond with series of bombings the following day.\n\n\n17 February: A bomb exploded near a tourist hotel in the town of Sungai Kolok, killing five persons and wounding over 40. Four persons were killed in other incidents.\n\n3 April: A series of bomb attacks in Songkhla killed two people and leaving 66 injured. The bombings marked the beginning of attacks against ethnic Thai–Chinese–owned businesses who were considered Thaksin supporters and against southern Thailand independence as a Muslim state.\n\n14 July: A major attack was launched on the provincial capital of Yala city. Sixty militants targeted an area near a hotel, the railway station, two convenience stores and a restaurant roaming the streets using guns, fire-bombs, and explosives.\n\n18 July: Two militants entered a teashop, shot Lek Pongpla, a Buddhist cloth vendor, beheaded him and left the head outside of the shop.\n\n19 July: The Thai Prime Minister enacted the \"emergency powers law\" to manage the three troubled states giving himself sweeping powers to direct military operations, suspend civil liberties, and censor the press. Several human rights organisations and local press expressed their concerns that these new powers might be used to violate civil liberty rights. However, the emergency decree was highly popular, with 72 percent of Bangkok residents and 86 percent of people in the three southern provinces supporting it. Nevertheless, the insurgency escalated further.\n\n31 August: Three bombs exploded almost simultaneously. Subsequently, 131 civilians from the south fled to neighbouring Malaysia seeking refuge from the Thai authorities. Thailand immediately accused the refugees of being insurgents and demanded that they be returned, sparking a diplomatic spat. Currently, the people are still in Malaysia. Thailand, suspecting that insurgents may also have fled with the refugees, has asked Malaysia to return these Thai citizens but Malaysia has refused on humanitarian grounds.\n\n16 October: A group of 20 separatists attacked a Buddhist monastery, killing three. An extended state of emergency was announced in the three southern provinces plagued by the insurgency. The announcement sparked a large scale guerrilla raid on 60 targets, in which at least seven persons were killed and 90 weapons were stolen.\n\n16 November: Separatists killed nine civilians and injured nine others.\n\n\n\n7 January: Four suspected militants fatally shot two border-police at a weekend market in Yala Province. Three others were killed in separate attacks on the same day.\n\n10 May: A bomb exploded at a tea shop killing at least three persons and injuring more than a dozen.\n\n15 June: During the 60th anniversary of the accession of Bhumibol Adulyadej to the Thai throne, well-coordinated bomb-attacks against at least 40 government and official buildings occurred. Two police officials died and 11 others were injured. Experts say that the bomb attacks were a message to the Thai authorities, rather than an attempt to do real damage, as the bombs were loaded with small amounts of explosives. Had the devices been larger, the casualties and injuries would have been notably greater. The Thai media was late in reporting the incident, only doing so after the BBC and other international news services had announced it.\n\n18 June: Mass graves of about 300 migrant workers were found in southern Thailand.\n\n27 June: Seven persons including five security personnel were killed in separatist attacks.\n\n31 August: Twenty-two commercial banks were simultaneously bombed in Yala Province, killing a retired military officer and wounding 24 people. Afterwards, Army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin announced that he would break with government policy and negotiate with the leaders of the insurgency. However, he noted that \"We still don't know who is the real head of the militants we are fighting with.\" In a press conference the next day, he slammed the government for political interference, and asked that the government \"Free the military and let it do the job.\" By 16 September, the army admitted that it still wasn't sure who to negotiate with.\n\nSeptember: Army Commander Sonthi Boonyaratkalin was granted an extraordinary increase in executive powers to combat the unrest.\n\n16 September: Six remotely detonated motorcycle bombs simultaneously exploded in the 2006 Hat Yai bombings, killing four people and wounding more than sixty. A Canadian and a Malaysian were among the dead.\n\n21 September: Two villagers were shot in Yala, killing one and wounding another.\n\n23 September: Four police were injured in a bus stop explosion in Pattani. The bus stop was on a road that would be passed by the motorcade of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn later that afternoon.\n\n25 September: Two police stations and a military outpost were attacked by 30 gunmen in a coordinated series of attacks in Yala, leaving two dead and one injured.\n\n27 September: Gunmen killed a grocer and two of his customers in Mueang Yala District of Yala Province and a traveller on the bus from Panare District to Mayo District of Pattani.\n\n28 September: A teacher protection unit in Su-ngai Padi District of Narathiwat Province was ambushed by a bomb attack, seriously injuring four soldiers and killing one.\n\n18 October: Suspected Muslim guerrillas raided an army base, killing one soldier and wounding four others.\n\n4 November: Three schools burned to the ground and a person received a gunshot wound.\n\n5 November: A bomb blast killed two soldiers and injured three others. Four persons were killed and six wounded in a series of shootings and bomb blasts.\n\n9 November: Eight car and motorcycle showrooms were simultaneously bombed in Yala, injuring 13. Almost all gold shops in Mueang District closed down for fear of their safety. Commercial banks remained open, but with tightened security.\n\n\n15 November: Militants shot dead three persons in separate drive-by shootings. One soldier was also wounded in a bomb blast.\n\n17 November: Three bomb explosions killed one person and wounded at least 30 others.\n\n22 November: Wan Kadir Che Wan, leader of Bersatu, one of the southern insurgent groups, told Al Jazeera television that the Al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) terrorist network was helping local insurgents stage attacks in Thailand.\n\n27 November: After all schools in Pattani announced indefinite shutdown, teachers in Yala and Narathiwat followed suit and closed down schools in the two provinces indefinitely for safety. The decision in Pattani was made after a series of arson attacks against schools and the fatal shooting of two schoolteachers. In Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat Provinces over 1,000 schools were shut down.\n\n9 December: A police informant was killed in a drive-by shooting.\n\n29 December: Two teachers were shot and burned to death.\n\n31 December: Nine bomb blasts occurred in Bangkok on New Year's Eve, killing three persons and injuring 38. New Year's Eve celebrations were cancelled.\n\nDespite conciliatory gestures from the junta, the insurgency continued and intensified. The death toll, 1,400 at the time of the coup, increased to 2,579 by mid-September 2007.\n\nFrom January 2004 to 21 June 2007, the south witnessed 6,850 violent incidents related to the insurgency. At least 2,303 people were killed and more than 6,000 injured in that time, according to Srisompob Jitpiromsri of Prince of Songkhla University's Pattani campus.\n\nJunta chairman Sonthi Boonyaratglin announced that the Southern Border Provinces Administrative Centre (SBPAC) and the Civilian-Police-Military Task Force (CPM) 43 would be revived. Sonthi said the army-led multi-agency Southern Border Provinces Peace Building Command would be dissolved and its troops would come under CPM 43, which would operate in parallel with the SBPAC. The SBPAC and CPM 43 had been dissolved in mid-2001 by former Premier Thaksin Shinawatra. Before that, CPM 43 was under the directive of the SBPAC. Sonthi also made himself head of the Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC). Previously, ISOC had been headed by the prime minister.\n\nISOC was given 5.9 billion baht in funding for fiscal year 2007. By May 2007, General Sonthi asked the government for an additional emergency budget of two billion baht for ISOC, as the normal budget was running out. The money was under the \"secret budget\" category, which meant that state officials could spend it without having to account for it.\n\n14 January: A rubber tapper named Pin Khotchathin was beheaded in Yala. His head was found at a rubber plantation in Tambon Tasae in Yala's Mueang district five metres from his body. It was the 22nd murder to feature a beheading since May 2004, although the militants were not always successful in removing their victim's head.\nA handwritten note was left near Pin's head warning of further bloodshed to avenge what the attackers, calling themselves \"Pattani Warriors,\" claimed was a case of authorities killing separatist members.\n\nFacing rising violence, Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont accused Muslim junta chief Sonthi Boonyaratkalin of failing to do enough to curb the insurgency.\n\n18 February: A series of bombings and arson attacks began in Narathiwat, Yala, and Pattani, and Songkhla Provinces. Six people were killed and over 50 were injured.\n\nViolence escalated though in the months following the implementation of the junta's \"hearts and minds\" campaign. The monthly death toll increased by 30 percent in the five months after the coup compared to the five months before the coup. Insurgents targeted Princess Sirindhorn by placing a bomb near her helicopter's landing pad. A senior aide to Queen Sirikit, Thanpuying Viriya Chavakul, was injured and narrowly escaped death when gunmen attacked her vehicle convoy on 21 February 2007 in Yala. She later criticised the government for rotating troops too often, preventing them from building bonds with locals. She also made note of troops' lack of communications equipment and bulletproof vests.\n\nAfter an official visit to Thailand, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi volunteered to act as a mediator in arranging talks between insurgents and Thai authorities. Foreign Minister Nitya Pibulsonggram rejected the offer.\n\nDuring the Chinese New Year weekend (from the evening of 18 February 2007 to the afternoon of 19 February 2007), insurgents executed 38 bombing attacks, 26 cases of arson, and seven ambushes. The bombings targeted hotels, karaoke bars, power grids and commercial sites. Two public schools were torched. Three people were arrested. Junta chief Sonthi and Interior Minister Aree Wongsearaya admitted that they knew in advance that attacks were going to take place. Aree later admitted that the government's southern strategy was flawed.\n\n21 February: In their most significant act of economic terrorism and arson to date, insurgents burned down the Southland Rubber warehouse in Yala, destroying 5,000 tons of rubber worth approximately 400 million baht and engulfing Yala city in a dense cloud of black smoke for 12 hours. Thirty fire trucks fought to control the flames in the largest rubber warehouse in the deep south. Spikes were scattered on the road leading to the warehouse to slow emergency workers. No casualties were reported.\n\nMarch: The junta's top security advisor admitted that insurgents imported their techniques from Al-Qaeda and the Taliban and were motivated by not only by nationalist reasons, like previous generations of insurgents, but religious extremism as well. However, it noted that it still did not know who was behind the insurgency.\n\nTo protect the Buddhist minority from violence, the Internal Security Operations Command produced Jatukham Rammathep amulets for public distribution. The renowned animist amulets were believed by some to have magical powers to protect their holders from violence and large sums were generally paid for them. The plan was developed by Colonel Manas Khongpan, deputy director of the ISOC in Yala Province.\n\nIn March 2007, Queen Sirikit vowed to protect people of all religions in the south, and initiated weapons training programmes for locals, particularly teachers. Sirikit's deputy aide-de-camp Napol Boonthap said that the government should review its strategy and not only use a conciliatory approach towards the insurgents. \"Legal action must also be taken against the wrongdoers to show we mean business,\" he said.\n\n14 March: Eight commuters from Betong to Hat Yai were executed after their van was stopped by insurgents. A roadside bomb delayed rangers stationed nearby in their efforts to reach the site. A Pattani United Liberation Organisation (PULO) executive blamed a portion of the violence directly on paramilitary rangers who instigated violence and then blamed insurgents for their deeds.\n\nCrown Prince Vajiralongkorn's motorcade was again targeted by a bombing in March 2007. A local police team found the bomb before it could explode.\n\nApril: Junta chief Sonthi rejected a US offer to help train Thai forces to quell the insurgency. Sonthi continued to deny that international terrorists operate in the south.\n\n9 April: A pick-up truck carrying students and other passengers returning from a funeral was shot upon, killing two 12-year-old boys and two other 25-year-old university students. The funeral was for the Khuen Bang Lang tambon administration organisation chief, who was shot dead hours earlier the same day. The military initially claimed that insurgents were behind the shooting. It later admitted that village defence volunteers attacked, after allegedly being \"provoked\" by insurgent sympathisers on the truck. Several hundred angry villagers staged protests against the shooting, demanding the government take action against those responsible.\n\n13 April: Protests after a mistaken shooting by security forces. Thai soldiers in Pattani shot and killed three Muslim teenagers. The soldiers, who were dispatched to investigate the torching of four mobile-phone relay outlets, opened fire on a group of teenagers when the soldiers thought the teenagers were charging at them. Locals reported that the teenagers were playing tag on the road near a weekly open market near where the soldiers were investigating. Three teenagers, aged 13 to 15 years, were killed and two others were injured. Local army commander Colonel Wanchai Paungkhumsa initially said the soldiers had acted in self-defense, saying that gunshots were fired from where a teenager was standing. Residents ended their protest after reaching a series of agreements with Pattani Governor Panu Uthairath over the shooting. The military agreed to investigate the shootings, and if it was a negligent act, soldiers would be faced criminal charges, be transferred out of the area, and an apology would be given to locals.\n\nMay: Sonthi started withdrawing troops from the south, replacing them with territorial defence volunteers. He did not say why the regular army was to be reduced in the south.\n\n14 May: Separatist insurgents shot dead a Thai-Buddhist couple working as fruit pickers in the majority-Muslim area of Bannang Sata, Yala Province and injured their three-year-old daughter.

Pro-Russian authorities at Donetsk city recorded 16 Ukrainian violations of the ceasefire in ten different locations using small arms, heavy machine guns, 73 mm antitank recoilless rifles, antiaircraft guns, 82 mm mortars, 120 mm mortars and tanks. According to local sources, the Ukrainian military broke the ceasefire eight times within the borders of the self-styled Luhansk People's Republic. The Ukrainian military employed small arms, heavy machine guns, automatic grenade launchers, antitank rocket launchers, 73 mm antitank recoilless rifles, 82 mm mortars, 120 mm mortars, BMP-1 armoured vehicles and 122 mm self-propelled artillery to engage pro-Russian positions at Sokolniki, Krasnyi Yar, Kalynivka, Kalynove, Pryshyb and Lozove.\n\nAccording to the information provided by the press-centre of the JFO in the evening, from 7:00 am to 6:00 pm pro-Russian military had opened fire on positions of Ukrainian troops on 6 occasions, the fire was returned on several occasions, no casualties were reported.

{"id": "1944058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1944058", "title": "Ute muster", "text": "Ute muster\n\nA ute muster is an Australian festival which brings together large numbers of utes and their owners. These events typically include competitions and other side events, occur annually, and normally last several days and are held in rural and regional areas of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThese events can be seen as a more rural version of the Summernats, a festival which promotes a wider range of car culture.\n\nThe Caboolture Urban Country Music Festival, which features a \"Beaut Ute\" competition, is a country music festival established in 2004.\n\nOften ute musters are combined with a larger festival such as a rodeo, agricultural show or music festival, and are usually sponsored by companies which are local to where the muster is being held.\n\nUte musters are often mis-represented as being attended by yobbos who just like to drink, this is no longer the case, but instead an outlet for enthusiastic ute owners to show off their pride and joy in their vehicles which are personalised with lights, stickers, bull bars, and various after-market add-ons. They are generally held to raise money for towns, charities and local causes, and have run in conjunction with agricultural shows or Bachelor and Spinster Balls which raise money for local charities.\n\nThe Deniliquin Ute Muster is the largest event of its kind in the world. It is a stand-alone event which began as a celebration of all things Australian and the Aussie icon of the ute, and has developed into a two-day festival, with live music concerts, ute driving competitions, the Australian National Circle Work Championships TM, show and shine arena, and bull ride.\n\nUte enthusiasts tend to have an obsession with bumper stickers, often covering the entire rear window of the ute with them. Accumulating the most different stickers is a sort of status symbol which is often the deciding factor in many of the \"Beaut Ute\" competitions (see below). Some of the popular stickers are Bundaberg Rum, Holden, Jim Beam, Ute Muster and the Conargo Pub.\n\nThe event itself involves a congregation of ute enthusiasts who enter their utes in a number of competitions, sometimes referred to as a \"Beaut Ute Competition\". Some of the typical categories are:\nOther categories are also included and run on the day these are called novelty categories and normally take a side step from the general categories to make a bit of fun to fill in the day.\nsome novelty categories include:\n\nMost of the ute muster events around Australia try to compete with each other by continually breaking new records of gathering the most vehicles in the one place.\n\nHowever, that mantle has been claimed by Deniliquin which previously held a small ute show as part of its annual Pastoral and Agricultural Show, but developed the idea into a tourist-attracting event. In 1999 a group of community-minded people got together with the idea of celebrating all things Australian, including the Aussie icon of the ute, to attract people to the agricultural town of Deniliquin, located in the southern Riverina region of New South Wales. In its first year, the event held a Guinness Book of Records count of \"the largest parade of legally registered utes in the world\", and each year new records are broken. \n\nIn 1999, 2839 drivers took part, establishing \"Deniliquin\" as the ute capital of the world. Since that time, the event has grown in popularity and each year breaks its existing world record. As of 2010, Deniliquin’s current record stands at 8,152 utes, with over 25,000 attendees in a town that normally has a population of about 8000. \n\nThe Deniliquin Ute Muster also holds a record count for most number of people wearing blue singlets - in 2010 that Guinness Book of Records count stands at 3500 people. \n\nIn 2013, a new ute record of 9,736 was set and a new blue singlet record of 3,924 was counted.\n\nUte musters are often held to help raise funds for local charities, such as raising funds for local schools or hospitals. Often the ute musters are associated with local groups such as Apex or Rotary. They are seen as a good drawcard to bring in money from participants who are not members of the local community - so all money spent is extra money for the local community, whether it goes to the local charity, or just to the local economy.\n\nMusters are often held in conjunction with local agricultural shows. This will assists organisers in arranging advertising, insurance and other sponsorship. It can also assist in obtaining the cooperation of local emergency services such as police and ambulance, if the muster is one aspect of a larger, previously established local event.\n\nMost ute musters charge a relatively small fee for participants, allowing them to enter any category they are qualified for. Most participants would enter between five and ten categories, as this keeps the event proceeding. Many participants travel long distances to enter and prefer activities to be held in a short timeframe to allow them to join in other parts of the festival.\n\nWell organised events cater for camping. As this is a usual festival environment drawing participants from large distances in country areas there are limited opportunities for public transport. Both competitors and other participants often make extensive use of any bar facilities; in many events the bar provides a large portion of the funds raised. Well organised events provide for camping as often the most practical accommodation for all concerned.\n\nWhilst larger musters can annoy some locals, this is seen as the exception rather than the rule. Most musters attract between 20-100 utes, depending upon event advertising. Commonly, musters also have maximum numbers permitted to attend - this is often a requirement in obtaining event permits.\n\nEvent committees need to liaise carefully with local law enforcement. The muster held at Deniliquin is a good example of close relationships with NSW Police. Whilst the organisers recognise that some attendees can flout the law, this is seen as a minority and the event is able to proceed in a realistic environment. This achieves the event's goals of fundraising and ensures participants are able to enjoy the event.\n\n"}

{"id": "497940", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=497940", "title": "Von Steuben Day", "text": "Von Steuben Day\n\nVon Steuben Day is a holiday traditionally held on a weekend in mid-September (von Steuben was born September 17), celebrating the Prussian-born Baron Friedrich von Steuben, who arrived in the United States as a volunteer offering his services to General George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. Von Steuben is still regarded as one of the most important German Americans, as his training of the young American troops made victory against the British possible and thus his work helped in gaining independence for the United States of America. The day is generally considered the German-American event of the year; celebrations focus on parades in which participants march, dance, and play music.\n\nThe German-American Steuben Parade is an annual parade traditionally held in cities across the United States on Von Steuben Day.\n\nThe New York City parade is held every third Saturday in September (on the 17th in 2016, on the 16th in 2017, and on the 15th in 2018). It was founded in 1957 by immigrants from Germany who, being part of the largest self-reported immigrant ancestral group in the United States, wanted to keep the traditions of their German homeland alive.\n\nThe Philadelphia parade, founded in 1970, is normally held every fourth Saturday in September.\n\nThe Chicago parade was featured in the film \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\".\n\nWhile Steuben Day is celebrated in many cities all across the United States, the largest crowds gather in New York City. Every year on the third Saturday in September, German-Americans celebrate the Annual Steuben Parade on Fifth Avenue and an Oktoberfest-style beer fest complete with food and live music in Central Park. The Parade was founded in 1957 and has grown into one of the largest celebrations of German and German-American culture in the United States. In 2010, the Parade was held on September 25. In 2007, German-Americans celebrated the 50th Anniversary of this affair and welcomed former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger as Grand Marshal and former German chancellor Helmut Kohl as Guest of Honor.\n\nThe first Steuben Parade was held in the German neighborhood of Ridgewood Queens. In 1958, the parade moved to Yorkville known then as Germantown, and lined up on 86th Street. Over the years, as the event grew bigger, it drew an ever-larger number of spectators. Soon it gained the City's recognition and marched up Fifth Avenue, turning on to 86th St, and marching all the way across to First Avenue to cheering crowds.\n86th Street was once the heart of Little Germany and was affectionately called the \"German Boulevard\" It hosted many German shops, Konditereis, Biergartens, Vereins, theaters, restaurants, newspapers, and dance halls.\n\nToday, the parade still marches up Fifth Avenue but now ends only at Fifth Avenue and 86th Street. It is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of West Point, which was founded by General von Steuben. The three-hour-long parade is dominated by traditional German groups, spectacular colorful floats, and marching bands, clubs and organizations from Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as the USA and Canada, wearing their traditional German costumes. The parade honors one or more Grand Marshals, who are either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a distinct relationship to America.\n\nEvery year the German-American Steuben Parade is led by cadets representing the German Language Club of the Military Academy of West Point, which was founded by General von Steuben. However, it is not a parade in the military tradition. The rest of the about three-hour-long parade is dominated by traditional German brass music groups and marching bands, by clubs and organization wearing traditional German Tracht, as well as by carnival groups, marksmen or representatives of other traditions. For many years, the parade has had a strong Bavarian theme, dominated by men wearing Lederhosen, women in Dirndl and groups dancing the traditional Schuhplattler. Recently though, the parade opened up to represent more German themes.\n\nEvery year, the German-American Steuben Parade is led by one or more Grand Marshals, who are either American citizens with a German background or German citizens with a distinct relationship to America.\n\nThe Grand Marshals in 2009 were Congressman Michael McMahon, Fox 5 TV reporter Linda Schmidt, A&P Chairman Christian Haub, and Parade Co-founder Ted Dengler. In previous years, Grand Marshals included Hollywood star Ralf Möller, NYSE CEO Duncan Niederauer and Col. Gail Halvorsen, the \"Candy-Bomber\" from the 1948–49 Berlin Airlift.\n\nIn 2007, celebrating the 50th Anniversary German-American Steuben Parade, the Grand Marshal was former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, who was born in the Franconia region of Bavaria in Germany. The Guest of Honor was Dr. Klaus Scharioth, the German Ambassador to the United States. Also invited was former German chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is known to have a deep personal friendship towards America.\nOver the years the Steuben Parade has been led by many distinguished Germans and Americans. Former Grand Marshals include Donald Trump, Siegfried & Roy, George Steinbrenner, Carol Alt, Eric Braeden, John Roland, Louis Freeh, Norbert Schramm. Several Mayors of New York City of non-German background have also led the parade, including Michael Bloomberg, Rudolph Giuliani, and George Pataki.\n\nAmong the Guests of Honor have been three German presidents: Walter Scheel, Richard von Weizsäcker and Johannes Rau, as well as other dignitaries from the political and economic fields, including state prime ministers Erwin Teufel, Kurt Biedenkopf and Bernhard Vogel.\n\nWhile the German-American Steuben Parade itself is held on the third Saturday in September, starting at noon, there are other festivities all weekend. Usually, up to 35 music and costume groups from overseas are greeted at City Hall Park on the Friday preceding the parade. On the eve of the parade a gala benefit banquet takes place as a fundraiser for the parade. \n\nThe parade itself leads directly to the German-American Friendship Party in Central Park. This is the largest beer fest in New York, featuring many German brands on tap, as well as traditional German food such as bratwurst.\n\nEach May, the German-American Steuben Parade Committee crowns a Miss German-America, who serves as Queen of the Steuben Day Parade in September. She is selected on the basis of her German-American heritage and her knowledge of German culture, and is expected to promote the parade and its events and numerous German festivals throughout the New York region each summer. Past winners include: Nicole Radske (2006), Christina Rom (2007), Melissa Gratzl (2008), Virginia Kovak (2009), Stephanie Russell-Kraft (2010), Denise Manukian (2011), Kirsten Mueller (2012), Kristina Kren (2013) Stefanie Kraker (2014) and Samantha Hart (2015).\n\nSeptember is host to many German and German-American cultural events aside from the parade. They range from a reading with German comedian Hape Kerkeling, concerts in Carnegie Hall to Jazz performances by German musicians, from a pop-art event with Berlin and New York based artist Jim Avignon to a German cartoon exhibition. There are also events celebrating the historic aspect of German-American traditions, like a walking tour through Little Germany \"Kleindeutschland\" on New York's Lower East Side or a tour through the Tenement Museum there.\n\nThe cornflower is the official flower and the logo of the German-American Steuben Parade of New York City, as it widely grows in both Germany and the United States. Also, the color blue symbolizes friendship and hope. In addition the Cornflower was the national Flower of Prussia since its introduction by Kaiser Wilhelm I to honor his mother Queen Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and because of its color (prussian blue)\n\nThe parade and all related events are organized by the German-American Steuben Parade Committee. Since 2014, the committee has been led by General Chairman Bob Radske, and two Vice Chairmen, Nicole Miskiewicz, and Herb Seeff. The membership of the committee consists of representatives of a multitude of German-American organizations from the New York metropolitan area, some involved in the founding of the parade in 1957. The Steuben Parade is overseen by the German-American Committee of Greater New York, a non-for-profit organization registered in New York with 501(c)3 status.\n\nTo celebrate the accomplishments of Baron von Steuben, the Philadelphia Von Steuben Day Parade is 50 miles from Valley Forge, where Steuben trained the Revolutionary Army. Philadelphia is where the Continental Congress met to sign the Declaration of Independence. It was also home to Benjamin Franklin, who was sent to France by the Continental Congress. It was during this trip that Franklin was introduced to von Steuben. \n\nIn addition, in 1683 William Penn invited the thirteen German families from Krefeld to join his \"Grand Experiment\". They eventually settled and founded Germantown, now a section of Philadelphia. In 1983, a parade celebrated the 300th anniversary of the founding of Germantown. At that time, a group from Krefeld brought with them the Tri-Centennial Bike, a thirteen-seat bicycle, that has become a feature of our annual parade.\n\nWhile the German–American Steuben Parade itself is held on the fourth Saturday in September, starting at noon, there are other festivities all weekend. On the eve of the parade a gala benefit banquet is held at the Cannstatter Volksfest Verein.\n\nOn Parade day itself, the day begins with an Ecumenical Service at 10:00 am. After the parade, participants are welcome to join the Oktoberfest held by the Bavarian Volksfest Verein, on the grounds of the United German - Hungarian Club. \n\nThe parade and all related events are organized by the Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity. The association is currently led by General Chairman Thomas Markow, and two Vice Chairmen, Werner Fricker and James Schwartz. The membership of the association consists of representatives of a multitude of German-American organizations from the Philadelphia metropolitan area. The Steuben Day Observance Association of Philadelphia and Vicinity is a non-for-profit organization registered in Pennsylvania with 501(c)3 status.\n\nThe Chicago parade was in the 1986 John Hughes movie \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off\", even though other movie details indicate that Ferris Bueller's Day Off takes place near the end of the school year, not in September or on a Saturday.\n\n\n\n \n"}

Hinchliffe\n\nCaptain Walter George Raymond Hinchliffe (10 June 1894 – 13 March 1928), also known as Hinch (the surname is often incorrectly given as Hinchcliffe) was a distinguished Royal Naval Air Service and Royal Air Force flying ace in World War I who was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. A pioneering military and civilian flying career was cut short when he attempted a treacherous flight across the Atlantic Ocean with Elsie Mackay in a single engined Stinson Detroiter.\n\nHinchliffe was born in Liverpool in 1894 to Richard George Hinchliffe (1868 - circa 1942) and Florence Williams. His younger sister Gladys was born in 1897 in Liverpool. He was educated at Liverpool College, where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps, then attended medical school, training as a dentist. He spoke four languages (including German), was an avid reader, a skilled artist, an accomplished sportsman and a skilled mechanic. He met his Dutch wife Emilie Gallizien when he was Chief Pilot of the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM) and she was assistant to the company's General Manager.\n\nHis brother in law F. C. Lay was the first Pupil to become head master at the City of Oxford High School for Boys.\n\nHinchliffe was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the North Lancashire Brigade Company, West Lancashire Divisional Transport and Supply Column (Territorial Army) of the British Army Service Corps on 20 March 1912, and promoted Lieutenant on 17 September 1914. He is then believed to have served in the Royal Artillery from 1914–16 before joining the Royal Naval Air Service where he underwent training at Redcar, Cranwell and Frieston.\n\nGaining his Royal Aero Club Certificate in September 1916 as Flight Sub-Lieutenant, Royal Naval Air Service, he served as an Instructor at Cranwell before joining 10 Squadron RNAS in January 1918 to commence active service. During February and March his successful sorties in a Sopwith Camel named \"Allo Lil Bird\" included bombing raids and downing two enemy aircraft in dogfights at Rumbeke and Roulers.\n\nWhen the Royal Air Force was formed on 1 April 1918, he was appointed Lieutenant (Honorary Captain) RAF in the (renamed) No. 210 Squadron RAF. Within three months he had shot down a further five enemy aircraft, at Roulers, Bailleul, Neuve-Église, Armentières and Hazebrouck. During the Hazebrouck night encounter he was shot through the forehead and crashed at Nieppe Forest (Dickebusch Lake). He suffered severe facial injuries and lost the sight in his left eye for which he wore a patch for the rest of his life. For his exploits he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. He was transferred to the RAF unemployed list on 21 August 1919. He was initially hospitalised on 23 June 1918 and then invalided home on 27 June and treated at a hospital in central Hampstead.\n\nAfter the War he became a widely experienced pilot, pioneering, opening and flying many civilian routes for both KLM and Imperial Airways. In 1920 he made the first airmail flight from the Netherlands to England. In 1921 he made the first civilian passenger night-flights from Lympne to Amsterdam, and Amsterdam to Berlin. His new routes included Amsterdam-Gelsenkirchen-Dortmund-London-Amsterdam in 11 hours flying time and Berlin-Amsterdam-London-Lowestoft-Lympne in just over 12 hours flying time. During 1922-1923 he was Chief Pilot of KLM.\nIn 1923 he joined Instone Air Line covering Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, London and Paris, and after the merger into Imperial Airways he flew a De Havilland Hercules to Cairo and opened up the Imperial Airways Eastern route.\n\nHis flying experience included over 40 types of aircraft including; Avro, British Aerial Transport, Bleriot, Bristol F2b, Caudron, Curtis, De Havilland, Fokker, Grahame-White Boxkite, Handley-Page, Nieuport, Pemberton-Billing Scout, Sopwith Camel, Sopwith Dolphin, Sopwith 1½ Strutter, Sopwith Pup, Vickers Vimy and Vickers Vulcan.\n\nIn September 1927, Hinchliffe flew Charles A. Levine back to the US, replacing Clarence Chamberlin who had flown Levine from the U.S. to Germany. Hinchliffe and Levine were filmed at the Clapham Studios in London for a short film made in the DeForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process before their departure.\n\nHinchliffe's peerless reputation made him the natural choice for pilot when Elsie Mackay attempted to achieve her ambition to be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. The daughter of P & O chairman James Mackay, 1st Earl of Inchcape had bought a Stinson Detroiter, and had it shipped from the USA to England and delivered to the Brooklands motor racing track, which at the time was also used as an airfield. Named \"Endeavour\", it was a monoplane with gold tipped wings and a black fuselage, powered by a 9 cylinder, 300 h.p. Wright Whirlwind J-6-9 (R-975) engine, with a cruising speed of 84 mph.\n\nIn early March 1928 the \"Daily Express\" discovered that Captain Hinchliffe and Elsie were preparing for a transatlantic attempt by carrying out test flights at RAF Cranwell and were staying at The George Hotel in Leadenham. near Grantham. The story was silenced by Elsie's threatened legal action as she intended to depart in secret while her father was in Egypt, having promised her family she would not make the attempt. The \"Irish Times\" reported on 14 March 1928 \"Captain Hinchcliffe and Captain Joynson-Wreford were at Baldonnel Aerodrome about a fortnight ago, and, although no absolute definite arrangements were made, it was understood that he would make the aerodrome the headquarters for his Transatlantic attempt.\"\n\nAt 08:35am on 13 March 1928 \"Endeavour\" took off from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, with minimal fuss as Walter had told only two friends and Elsie had registered under the pseudonym of 'Gordon Sinclair'. Approximately five hours later, at 13.30pm the Chief lighthouse keeper at Mizen Head on the south west coast of Cork Ireland saw the monoplane over the village of Crookhaven, on the great circle course for Newfoundland. A French steamer later reported seeing them still on course, but nothing else is known. A crowd of 5,000 is reputed to have waited at Mitchel Field, Long Island. In December 1928, eight months later, a single piece of identifiable undercarriage washed ashore in North West Ireland.\n\n\n"}

Phillips (1863 – 1937) was a Spokane, Washington author, best remembered for \"The Bandit Invincible\", a biography of the outlaw Butch Cassidy.

Phillips claimed to have known Cassidy since childhood, and states in his book that Butch Cassidy's real name was not Robert Parker. Some have speculated that Phillips \"was\" Butch Cassidy but there is no evidence to support the claim.\n\nIn 2012, Larry Pointer stated that the original, unabridged manuscript of \"The Bandit Invincible\" had been brought to him for authentication by a collector in Utah. In it he found previously unknown references to an associate of Butch Cassidy's by the name of William T. Wilcox, who was described as having been in Wyoming Territorial Prison with Butch Cassidy. Given the name's similarity with \"William T. Phillips,\" he searched for a prison mugshot of Wilcox. Upon receiving it and observing the similarities between the two men, he revised his previous theory and concluded that Phillips was in fact Wilcox, instead of Butch Cassidy.\n\n\n"}
