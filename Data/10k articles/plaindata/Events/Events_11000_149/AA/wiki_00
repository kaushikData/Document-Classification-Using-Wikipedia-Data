Based on interviews conducted in 2003, the play explores the compromised issues of trust and truth that arose between the American government and its people during the lead-up to the Iraq War. \"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" was written and directed by Steve Cosson from interviews by the company, with music and lyrics by Michael Friedman.\n\n\"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" grew from interviews with people from all over America about what they believe regarding their current government and public culture. When writing about the motivation to create such a work, writer and director Steve Cosson said \n\"If a democracy depends in part on there being some common understanding of what is actually taking place in the world, then we wanted to know if in fact if such a consensus existed, and if not, then just how are people parsing reality?\"\n\"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" is marked by The Civilians' characteristic journalistic approach to theater, in which the play's foundation is built from a series of individual interviews, usually conducted by the cast members themselves. These interviews are not recorded, and transcribed later from memory. The dialogue from the interviews is then woven verbatim into the script, producing a kind of theater that Brian Logan from The Guardian describes thus: \"The Civilians co-mingle docudrama with cabaret, spinning their interviewees' responses into improbable, inquisitive song-and-soliloquy revues.\"\n\n\"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" takes on the question that was on the minds of many Americans as the Bush Administration began to launch the Iraq War: Who, or what, do we believe? It presents a dynamic range of real-life perspectives from across the country, from an Arab-American cab driver to a staffer at the Department of Homeland Security, everyone in the phone book listed under the name Jessica Lynch, an elderly Jewish woman, and even an alien. According to Sam Marlowe, in his review of \"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" when it played at the SoHo Theater in London, the play \"considers the impossibility of certainty in a world stuffed with lies.\" The scenes and monologues from Cosson's script are interspersed with composer Michael Friedman's musical numbers, producing a cabaret-like piece of theatre.\n\nAn early version of the play opened in September 2004 and was produced by The Civilians and presented by Performance Space 122. \"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" had its official U.S. Premiere by The Civilians at 59E59 Theaters, New York City, January 19, 2006. The play then received its London Premiere by The Civilians at Soho Theatre on September 6, 2006, after playing an award-winning run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival earlier that year. \"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" also toured along the East Coast during April 2006, playing shows at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, PA (April 19 – 23, 2006) and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA (April 25 – 30, 2006).\n\n\"(I Am) Nobody's Lunch\" garnered favorable reviews from such publications as \"The New York Times\", \"The Boston Globe\", and \"The Times\". The play also won a coveted First Fringe award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2006 and was named as a Critic's Choice: Top Five Plays selection by The Evening Standard.\n\nU.S. Premiere: Quincy Tyler Bernstine, Matt Dellapina, Brad Heberlee, Daoud Heidami, Caitlin Miller, Jennifer R. Morris, and Andy Boronson.\n\nLondon Premiere: Matt Dellapina, Daoud Heidami, Brandon Miller, Caitlin Miller, Lexy Fridell, and Andy Boroson on piano.\n"}

On August 16, 2018, it was announced that the military parade would be postponed until 2019. In cancelling the parade for 2018, Trump cited the projected high costs for the parade and blamed Washington DC city officials for the high projected costs.\n\nThe parade was expected to include members of all five armed services; the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and the Coast Guard, with other units that were to be dressed in period uniforms representing earlier times in the United States military history. A memo from General Joseph Dunford reported that the parade was to have focused on historic battles and conflicts such as the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Between 5,000 and 7,000 service members were to have taken part in the parade, which was to begin at the U.S. Capitol and end at the White House. The evolution of women in the service was also to be highlighted in the parade, along with an emphasis on the price of freedom. The parade would have included 100 wheeled vehicles instead of tanks, as well as a heavy air component featuring 50 aircraft at the end of the parade. U.S. President Donald Trump would have been situated in a reviewing area and surrounded by military heroes. Medal of Honor recipients would have been included in reviewing the parade with the President and would have marched in the parade.\n\nThe parade would also have coincided with the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I. It was to have been the first full scale parade in the nation's capital since 1991 involving the men and women of the active and reserve components of the United States Armed Forces and veterans' organizations and the first national Veterans' Day parade in years. U.S. President Donald Trump requested the military parade following his admiration of the Bastille Day military parade at the Champs-Élysées in Paris which he attended in 2017. \n\nOn August 17, 2018 U.S. President Donald Trump stated he canceled the parade due to the \"ridiculous\" $92 million price tag. Through Twitter he blamed local politicians for the price and suggested hosting another parade in 2019, and ended his tweets with; \"Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!\"\n\nIn spite of Trump's statements, Budget Director Mick Mulvaney claimed that the cancellation was not just for reasons of cost.\n\nA Pentagon official estimated the cost of the parade between $3 million and $50 million, earlier in 2018. Another suggestion of the cost was closer to $92 million, with at least $50 million being used to cover Pentagon costs for aircraft, equipment, personnel, and other support. This number was refuted by Defense Secretary Jim Mattis who stated; \"I'm not dignifying that number ($92 million) with a reply.\" The $92 million estimate was to be divided between the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which would have contributed $50 million and $42 million respectively.\n\nSeparately DC City officials estimated expenses related to the parade would have been $21.6 million with an expectation for reimbursement from the Federal government, with the Mayor of Washington DC Muriel Bowser reporting that $13 million would have been used alone to cover police costs.\n\nIn February 2017, few lawmakers backed the idea of a military parade. Senator David Perdue a Republican of Georgia told reporters \"He's the President of the United States. Personally, I would prefer not to do it. But he's the president.\" Senator Lindsey Graham a Republican of South Carolina, supported the parade if it honored the military itself, and not the \"...Soviet-style hardware display.\"\n\nAMVETS an group that advocates for military veterans felt that potentially the parade would inspire more Americans to join the armed forces.\n\nOther politicians spoke out against the parade. Representative Adam Smith a Democrat of Washington and members of the House Armed Services Committee released a statement that highlighted \"A military parade like this - one that is unduly focused on a single person - is what authoritarian regimes do, not democracies.\" Senator John Kennedy a Republican of Louisiana told reporters \"We're not North Korea, we're not Russia, and we're not China and I don't want to be.\" while speaking out against the proposed parade.\n\nRobert O'Neill a former Navy SEAL tweeted in February 2018 that any military parade would be \"...third world bullshit.\" Other military veterans echoed the sentiment with calls for the money to be spent on housing, employment and mental health care to better support the troops. A veteran of the War in Afghanistan highlighted that it would seem unreasonable to hold a parade in celebration while a 17 year-old war (per 2018) was still on going.\n\n"}

By the morning of June 2, the fire had expanded into the San Juan National Forest and had burned an estimated . The highway was closed between milemarkers 34 and 48 for public safety and to allow firefighters to keep the fire from crossing the highway. County Road 250 was also closed. Evacuation orders were put in place for residents of Baker's Bridge at County Road 250 north to Electra Lake Road, where 825 structures are threatened.\n\nBy the evening of June 3, the fire had grown to and was 10 percent contained. It expanded Hermosa Creek, prompting officials to issue pre-evacuation orders to the community of Hermosa. The next day, the fire showed significant activity due to winds. Highway 550 was again closed due to heavy smoke and fire teams focused on building defensible spaces around buildings and using controlled burns as needed. The fire is at 10 percent containment.\n\nBy June 5, new pre-evacuation orders were put in place for areas east of Hermosa due to southerly winds keeping the flames on the ridgeline on the slopes near the community. Temperatures were hotter than average and Forest Service personnel cited increased drought conditions as creating additional challenges. Crews continued to fight the fire using aerial support.\n\nThe Burrow Fire began on the opposite side of the Hermosa Creek Wilderness Area on June 8th. As of July 2, 2018 the fire had spread to within 10 miles of the 416 fire and burned over . \n\nBy June 29, the 416 fire had expanded to and was 37 percent contained.

Burnouts continued in the southwest in No Buck Creek.\n\nBy July 1, the fire had grown to and was 37 percent contained. Temperatures enabled crews to focus on containment in the south and southwestern side of the fire, while northwest winds caused smokey conditions for communities along Highway 550, including Durango and Hermosa Creek. Concerns about the fire impacting the Purgatory Resort were reduced, however hotshot crews remained in the area to protect the resort, if needed.\n\nOver 1300 homes and businesses were forced to evacuate due to the fire. As of July 2, no businesses or homes have been destroyed by the fire.\n\nThe fire forced the closure of Purgatory Ski Resort, Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, and the San Juan National Forest, as well as sporadic closures of Highway 550. The town of Silverton had to cancel their famed 4th of July Fireworks, which brings thousands of visitors to the tiny mountain town.

The videos projected simultaneously that comprise Kimsooja’s \"A Needle Woman\" (1999) presents the artist wearing precisely the same clothes, standing precisely the same way, and, it would seem, at the same time of day in various urban environments.\nA Needle Woman premiered at CCA Kitakyushu in 1999. In the Kitakyshu version the artist presented a video channel where she lied on top of a rock formation, as Kimsooja explained “When I was invited to make a new commissioned work at the Center for Contemporary Art in Kitakyushu, Japan, I thought I would do a performance piece - one in the city of Tokyo, and the other one in nature. Then I would juxtapose them together. (…) As a result one was standing still in the middle of a crowd, while the other was lying down on a rock, facing nature. Verticality and horizontality were a metaphor for a dynamic balance between urban and natural forces.” In further installations of \"A Needle Woman\" Kimsooja focused on the urban aspect of the work and shot a number of new videos where she stood absolutely still, her back facing the camera, amid passing crowds of inhabitants in Patan, Nepal; Havana, Cuba; N’Djamena, Chad; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Sana’a, Yemen; Jerusalem, Israel. \n\nKimsooja in these videos is often described as a nomadic figure traveling across the world to come to rest in a crowded thoroughfare. The Needle referred to in the title is Kimsooja theorizing herself as a needle passing through the fabric of a place and its people. A common feature of the locations visited in the work is that they are all places of violence, disrepair or unresolved conflict; lending to the needle a metaphoric function as an instrument of suture and healing. Subsequent versions of \"A Needle Woman\" were shown at MoMA PS1 Contemporary art center in 2001, at the Kunsthalle Bern in Bern Switzerland in 2001, for the 51st Venice Biennale as part of the Arsenale in 2005, and was projected as a single channel public art project for La Nuit Blanche on the facade of Hotel de Ville, Paris in 2009 \n"}

By the Byzantine era, celebrations commenced on 24 November and lasted for a month, until Saturnalia and the \"Waxing of the Light\". The festival included night-time feasting, drinking, and merriment. During this time, prophetic indications were taken as prospects for the remainder of the winter. The festival was celebrated as late as the 6th century, until emperor Justinian's repression of paganism.\n\nThe name of Brumalia comes from , , \"Winter solstice\", \"Winter cold\"; a shortening of , , presumed obsolete superlative form of , later (\"smallest\", \"shallowest\", \"briefest\").\n\nRoman life, during classical antiquity, centred on the military, agriculture, and hunting. The short, cold days of winter would halt most forms of work. Brumalia was a festival celebrated during this \"dark\", interludal period. It was chthonic in character and associated with crops, of which seeds are sown in the ground before sprouting.\n\nFarmers would sacrifice pigs to Saturn and Ceres. Vine-growers would sacrifice goats in honor of Bacchus—for the goat is an enemy of the vine; and they would skin them, fill the skin-bags with air and jump on them. Civic officials would bring offerings of firstfruits (including wine, olive oil, grain, and honey) to the priests of Ceres.\n\nAlthough Brumalia was still celebrated as late as the 6th century, it was uncommon and celebrants were ostracised by the Christian church.

Armed with rifles and other weapons, they killed 12 people and injured 11 others. The gunmen identified themselves as belonging to the Islamist terrorist group Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, which took responsibility for the attack. Several related attacks followed in the Île-de-France region on 7–9 January 2015, including the Hypercacher kosher supermarket siege where a terrorist held 19 hostages, of whom he murdered 4 Jews.\n\nFrance raised its Vigipirate terror alert and deployed soldiers in Île-de-France and Picardy. A major manhunt led to the discovery of the suspects, who exchanged fire with police. The brothers took hostages at a signage company in Dammartin-en-Goële on 9 January and were shot dead when they emerged from the building firing.\n\nOn 11 January, about two million people, including more than 40 world leaders, met in Paris for a rally of national unity, and 3.7 million people joined demonstrations across France. The phrase \"Je suis Charlie\" became a common slogan of support at the rallies and in social media. The staff of \"Charlie Hebdo\" continued with the publication, and the following issue print ran 7.95 million copies in six languages, compared to its typical print run of 60,000 in only French.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" (; French for \"Charlie Weekly\") is a French satirical weekly newspaper that features cartoons, reports, polemics, and jokes. The publication is irreverent and stridently non-conformist in tone, is strongly secularist, antireligious, and left-wing, publishing articles that mock Catholicism, Judaism, Islam, and various other groups as local and world news unfolds. The magazine was published from 1969 to 1981, and has been again from 1992 on.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" has a history of attracting controversy. In 2006, Islamic organisations under French hate speech laws unsuccessfully sued over the newspaper's re-publication of the \"Jyllands-Posten\" cartoons of Muhammad. The cover of a 2011 issue retitled \"Charia Hebdo\" (French for \"Sharia Weekly\"), featured a cartoon of Muhammad, whose depiction is forbidden in some interpretations of Islam. The newspaper's office was fire-bombed and its website hacked. In 2012, the newspaper published a series of satirical cartoons of Muhammad, including nude caricatures; this came days after a series of violent attacks on U.S. embassies in the Middle East, purportedly in response to the anti-Islamic film \"Innocence of Muslims\", prompting the French government to close embassies, consulates, cultural centres, and international schools in about 20 Muslim countries. Riot police surrounded the newspaper's offices to protect it against possible attacks.\n\nCartoonist Stéphane \"Charb\" Charbonnier had been the editor-in-chief of \"Charlie Hebdo\" since 2009. Two years before the attack he stated, \"We have to carry on until Islam has been rendered as banal as Catholicism.\" In 2013, al-Qaeda added him to its most wanted list, along with three \"Jyllands-Posten\" staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. Being a sport shooter, Charb applied for permit to be able to carry a firearm for self-defence. The application went unanswered.\n\nNumerous violent plots related to the \"Jyllands-Posten\" cartoons were discovered, primarily targeting cartoonist Westergaard, editor Rose, and the property or employees of \"Jyllands-Posten\" and other newspapers that printed the cartoons. Westergaard was the subject of several attacks and planned attacks, and lives under police protection. On 1 January 2010, police used guns to stop a would-be assassin in his home, who was sentenced to nine years in prison. In 2010, three men based in Norway were arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack against \"Jyllands-Posten\" or Kurt Westergaard; two of them were convicted. In the United States, David Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana were convicted in 2013 of planning terrorism against \"Jyllands-Posten\".\n\nIn France, blasphemy law ceased to exist with progressive emancipation of the Republic from the Catholic church between 1789 and 1830. In France, the principle of \"laïcité\" – the separation of church and state – was enshrined in the 1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, and in 1945 became part of the constitution. Under its terms, the government and all public administrations and services must be religion-blind and their representatives must refrain from any display of religion, but private citizens and organisations are free to practise and express the religion of their choice where and as they wish (although discrimination based on religion is prohibited).\n\nIn recent years there has been a trend towards a stricter interpretation of laïcité which would also prohibit users of public services from expressing their religion (e.g. the 2004 law which bans school pupils from wearing \"blatant\" religious symbols) or even ban citizens from expressing their religion in public even outside the administration and public services (e.g. a 2015 law project prohibiting the wearing of religious symbols by the employees of private crèches). This restrictive interpretation is not supported by the initial law on laïcité and is challenged by the representatives of all the major religions.\n\nAuthors, humorists, cartoonists and individuals have the right to satirise people, public actors and religions, a right which is balanced by defamation laws. These rights and legal mechanisms were designed to protect freedom of speech from local powers, among which was the then-powerful Catholic Church in France.\n\nThough images of Muhammad are not explicitly banned by the Quran itself, prominent Islamic views have long opposed human images, especially those of prophets. Such views have gained ground among militant Islamic groups. Accordingly, some Muslims take the view that the satire of Islam, of religious representatives, and above all of Islamic prophets is blasphemy in Islam punishable by death. According to the BBC, France has seen \"the apparent desire of some younger, often disaffected children or grandchildren of immigrant families not to conform to western, liberal lifestyles – including traditions of religious tolerance and free speech\". Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid indicates that the Islamic concept of Gheerah (protective jealousy) requires that Muslims protect Muhammad from blasphemy.\n\nOn the morning of 7 January 2015, a Wednesday, Charlie Hebdo staff were gathered at 10 Rue Nicolas-Appert in the 11th arrondissement of Paris for the weekly editorial meeting starting around 10:30. The magazine had moved into an unmarked office at this address following the 2011 firebombing of their previous premises.\n\nAround 11:30, two armed and hooded men burst first into the wrong address at number 6 Rue Nicolas-Appert, shouting \"Is this \"Charlie Hebdo\"?\" and threatening people. After realising their mistake and firing a bullet through a glass door, the two men left for number 10. There, they encountered cartoonist Corinne \"Coco\" Rey outside. They used threats to force her to key in the passcode to the door.\n\nThe men sprayed the lobby with gunfire upon entering. The first victim was maintenance worker Frédéric Boisseau, who was killed as he sat at the reception desk. The gunmen forced Rey at gunpoint to lead them to a second-floor office, where 15 staff members were having an editorial meeting, \"Charlie Hebdo\"s first news conference of the year. Reporter Laurent Léger said they were interrupted by what they thought was the sound of a firecracker—the gunfire from the lobby—and recalled, \"We still thought it was a joke. The atmosphere was still joyous.\"\n\nThe gunmen burst into the meeting room and called out Charb's name to target him before opening fire. The shooting lasted five to ten minutes. The gunmen aimed at the journalists' heads and killed them. During the gunfire, Rey survived uninjured by hiding under a desk, from where she witnessed the murders of Wolinski and Cabu. Léger also survived by hiding under a desk as the gunmen entered. Other witnesses reported that the gunmen identified themselves as belonging to Al-Qaeda in Yemen.\n\nPsychoanalyst Elsa Cayat, a French columnist of Tunisian Jewish descent, was killed. Another female columnist present at the time, crime reporter Sigolène Vinson, survived; one of the shooters aimed at her but spared her, saying, \"I'm not killing you because you are a woman\", and telling her to read the Quran. She said he left shouting, \"Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!\"\n\nAn authenticated video surfaced on the Internet that shows two gunmen and a police officer, Ahmed Merabet, who is wounded and lying on a sidewalk after an exchange of gunfire. This took place near the corner of Boulevard Richard-Lenoir and Rue Moufle, east of the main crime scene. One of the gunmen ran towards the policeman and shouted, \"Did you want to kill us?\" The policeman answered, \"No, it's fine, boss\", and raised his hand toward the gunman, who then gave the policeman a fatal shot to the head at close range.\n\nSam Kiley, of Sky News, concluded from the video that the two gunmen were \"military professionals\" who likely had \"combat experience\", saying that the gunmen were exercising infantry tactics such as moving in \"mutual support\" and were firing aimed, single-round shots at the police officer. He also stated that they were using military gestures and were \"familiar with their weapons\" and fired \"carefully aimed shots, with tight groupings\".\n\nThe gunmen then left the scene, shouting (according to witnesses), \"We have avenged the Prophet Muhammad. We have killed \"Charlie Hebdo\"!\" They escaped in a getaway car, and drove to Porte de Pantin, hijacking another car and forcing its driver out. As they drove away, they ran over a pedestrian and shot at responding police officers.\n\nIt was initially believed that there were three suspects. One identified suspect turned himself in at a Charleville-Mézières police station. Seven of the Kouachi brothers' friends and family were taken into custody. Jihadist flags and Molotov cocktails were found in an abandoned getaway car, a black Citroën C3.\n\n\"Charlie Hebdo\" had attracted attention for its controversial depictions of Muhammad.\nHatred for \"Charlie Hebdo\"s cartoons, which made jokes about Islamic leaders as well as the Islamic prophet Muhammad, is considered to be the principal motive for the massacre. Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, suggested that the motive of the attackers was clear: trying to shut down a media organisation that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad\".\n\nIn March 2013, Al-Qaeda's branch in Yemen, commonly known as Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), released a hit list in an edition of their English-language magazine \"Inspire\". The list included Stéphane Charbonnier (mentioned above in this article as Charlie Hebdo editor who died in this shooting) and others whom AQAP accused of insulting Islam.\nOn 9 January, AQAP claimed responsibility for the attack in a speech from AQAP's top Shariah cleric Harith bin Ghazi al-Nadhari, citing the motive as \"revenge for the honor\" of Muhammad.\n\n\n\nSeveral people at the meeting were unharmed, including book designer Gérard Gaillard, who was a guest, and staff members, Sigolène Vinson, , and Éric Portheault.\n\nThe cartoonist Coco was coerced into letting the murderers into the building, and was not harmed. Several other staff members were not in the building at the time of the shooting, including medical columnist Patrick Pelloux, cartoonists Rénald \"Luz\" Luzier and and film critic , who were late for work, cartoonist Willem, who never attends, editor-in-chief Gérard Biard and journalist Zineb El Rhazoui who were on holiday, journalist , who was at a funeral, and comedian and columnist Mathieu Madénian. Luz arrived in time to see the gunmen escaping.\n\nPolice quickly identified brothers Saïd Kouachi (; 7 September 1980 – 9 January 2015) and Chérif Kouachi (; 29 November 1982 – 9 January 2015) as the main suspects. French citizens born in Paris to Algerian immigrants, the brothers were orphaned at a young age. At the ages of 12 (Said) and 10 (Chérif), they came home from school one day to find their mother, pregnant for a sixth time, lying dead in their flat. Neighbours presumed suicide, but officially her death was recorded as caused by \"illness\". The two brothers were placed in a foster home in Rennes. After two years, they were moved to an orphanage in Corrèze in 1994, along with a younger brother and an older sister. The brothers moved to Paris around 2000.\n\nChérif, also known as Abu Issen, was part of an informal gang that met in the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in Paris to perform military-style training exercises and sent would-be jihadists to fight for al-Qaeda in Iraq after the 2003 invasion. Chérif was arrested at age 22 in January 2005 when he and another man were about to leave for Syria, at the time a gateway for jihadists wishing to fight US troops in Iraq. He went to Fleury-Mérogis Prison, where he met Amedy Coulibaly. In prison, they found a mentor, Djamel Beghal, who had been sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2001 for his part in a plot to bomb the US embassy in Paris. Beghal had once been a regular worshiper at Finsbury Park Mosque in London and a disciple of the radical preachers Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada.\n\nUpon leaving prison, Chérif Kouachi married and got a job in a fish market on the outskirts of Paris. He became a student of Farid Benyettou, a radical Muslim preacher at the Addawa Mosque in the 19th arrondissement of Paris. Kouachi wanted to attack Jewish targets in France, but Benyettou told him that France, unlike Iraq, was not \"a land of jihad\".\n\nOn 28 March 2008, Chérif was convicted of terrorism and sentenced to three years in prison, with 18 months suspended, for recruiting fighters for militant Islamist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's group in Iraq. He said outrage at the torture of inmates by the US Army at Baghdad Central Prison in Abu Ghraib inspired him to help Iraq's insurgency.\n\nFrench judicial documents state Amedy Coulibaly and Chérif Kouachi travelled with their wives in 2010 to central France to visit Djamel Beghal. In a police interview in 2010, Coulibaly identified Chérif as a friend he had met in prison and said they saw each other frequently. In 2010, the Kouachi brothers were named in connection with a plot to break out from jail another Islamist, Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem. For lack of evidence, they were not prosecuted. Belkacem was one of those responsible for the 1995 Paris Métro and RER bombings that killed eight people.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2010, Saïd Kouachi visited Yemen on a student visa to study at the San'a Institute for the Arabic Language. There, according to a Yemeni reporter who interviewed Saïd, he met and befriended Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the perpetrator of the attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 later in 2009. Also according to the reporter, the two shared an apartment for \"one or two weeks\".\n\nIn 2011, Saïd returned to Yemen for a number of months and trained with al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants. According to a senior Yemeni intelligence source, he met al Qaeda preacher Anwar al-Awlaki in the southern province of Shabwa. Chérif Kouachi told BFM TV that he had been funded by a network loyal to Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone strike in 2011 in Yemen. According to US officials, the US provided France with intelligence in 2011 showing the brothers received training in Yemen. French authorities monitored them until the spring of 2014. During the time leading to the \"Charlie Hebdo\" attack, Saïd lived with his wife and children in a block of flats in Reims. Neighbours described him as solitary.\n\nThe weapons used in the attack were supplied via the Brussels underworld. According to the Belgian press, a criminal sold Amedy Coulibaly the rocket-propelled grenade launcher and Kalashnikov rifles that the Kouachi brothers used.\n\nIn an interview between Chérif Kouachi and Igor Sahiri, one of France's BFMTV journalists, Chérif stated that \"We are not killers. We are defenders of the prophet, we don’t kill women. We kill no one. We defend the prophet. If someone offends the prophet then there is no problem, we can kill him. We don’t kill women. We are not like you. You are the ones killing women and children in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. This isn’t us. We have an honour code in Islam.\"\n\nA massive manhunt began immediately after the attack. One suspect left his ID card in an abandoned getaway car. Police officers searched apartments in the Île-de-France region, in Strasbourg and in Reims.\n\nPolice detained several people during the manhunt for the two main suspects. A third suspect voluntarily reported to a police station after hearing he was wanted, and was not charged. Police described the assailants as \"armed and dangerous\". France raised its terror alert to its highest level and deployed soldiers in Île-de-France and Picardy regions.\n\nAt 10:30 CET on 8 January, the day following the attack, the two primary suspects were spotted in Aisne, north-east of Paris. Armed security forces, including the National Gendarmerie Intervention Group (GIGN) and the Force d'intervention de la police nationale (FIPN), were deployed to the department to search for the suspects.\n\nLater that day, the police search concentrated on the Picardy, particularly the area around Villers-Cotterêts and the village of Longpont, after the suspects robbed a petrol station near Villers-Cotterêts, then reportedly abandoned their car before hiding in a forest near Longpont. Searches continued into the surrounding Forêt de Retz (130 km), one of the largest forests of France.\n\nThe manhunt continued with the discovery of the two fugitive suspects early in the morning of 9 January. The Kouachis had hijacked a Peugeot 206 near the town of Crépy-en-Valois. They were chased by police cars for approximately south down the N2 trunk road. At some point they abandoned their vehicle and an exchange of gunfire between pursuing police and the brothers took place near the commune of Dammartin-en-Goële, northeast of Paris. Several blasts went off as well and Saïd Kouachi sustained a minor neck wound. Several others may have been injured as well but no one was killed in the gunfire. The suspects were not apprehended and escaped on foot.\n\nAt around 9:30 am on 9 January, 2015, the Kouachi brothers fled into the office of Création Tendance Découverte, a signage production company on an industrial estate in Dammartin-en-Goële. Inside the building were owner Michel Catalano and a male employee, 26-year-old graphics designer Lilian Lepère. Catalano told Lepère to go hide in the building and remained in his office himself. Not long after, a salesman named Didier went to the printworks on business. Catalano came out with Chérif Kouachi who introduced himself as a police officer. They shook hands and Kouachi told Didier, \"Leave. We don't kill civilians anyhow.\" These words were what caused Didier to guess that Kouachi was a terrorist and he alerted the police.\n\nThe Kouachi brothers remained inside and a lengthy standoff began. Catalano re-entered the building and closed the door after Didier had left. The brothers were not aggressive towards Catalano, who stated, \"I didn't get the impression they were going to harm me.\" He made coffee for them and helped bandage the neck wound that Saïd Kouachi had sustained during the earlier gunfire. Catalano was allowed to leave after an hour. Catalano swore three times to the terrorists that he was alone and did not reveal Lepère's presence. The Kouachi brothers were never aware of him being there. Lepère hid inside a cardboard box and sent the Gendarmerie text messages for around three hours during the siege, providing them with \"tactical elements such as [the brothers'] location inside the premises\".\n\nGiven the proximity (10 km) of the siege to Charles de Gaulle Airport, two of the airport's runways were closed. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve called for a Gendarmerie operation to neutralise the perpetrators. An Interior Ministry spokesman announced that the Ministry wished first to \"establish a dialogue\" with the suspects. Officials tried to establish contact with the suspects to negotiate the safe evacuation of a school from the siege. The Kouachi brothers did not respond to attempts at communication by the French authorities.\n\nThe siege lasted for eight to nine hours, and at around 4:30 p.m. there were at least three explosions near the building. At around 5:00 pm, a GIGN team landed on the roof of the building and a helicopter landed nearby. Before gendarmes could reach them, the pair ran out of the building and opened fire on gendarmes. The brothers had stated a desire to die as martyrs and the siege came to an end when both Kouachi brothers were shot and killed. Lilian Lepère was rescued unharmed. A cache of weapons, including Molotov cocktails and a rocket launcher, was found in the area.\n\nDuring the standoff in Dammartin-en-Goële, Amedy Coulibaly, who had met the brothers in prison, took hostages in a kosher supermarket at Porte de Vincennes in east Paris. Coulibaly was reportedly in contact with the Kouachi brothers as the sieges progressed, and told police that he would kill hostages if the brothers were harmed. Coulibaly and the Kouachi brothers died within minutes of each other.\n\nThe police initially identified the 18-year-old brother-in-law of Chérif Kouachi, a French Muslim student of North African descent and unknown nationality, as a third suspect in the shooting, accused of driving the getaway car. He was believed to have been living in Charleville-Mézières, about 200 km northeast of Paris near the border with Belgium. He turned himself in at a Charleville-Mézières police station early in the morning on 8 January 2015. The man said he was in class at the time of the shooting, and that he rarely saw Chérif Kouachi. Many of his classmates said that he was at school in Charleville-Mézières during the attack. After holding him for about 50 hours, police said that he was not being charged at that time.\n\nThe remaining staff of \"Charlie Hebdo\" continued normal weekly publication, and the following issue print run had 7.95 million copies in six languages. In contrast, its normal print run was 60,000, of which it typically sold 30,000 to 35,000 copies. The cover depicts Muhammad holding a \"Je suis Charlie\" sign, and is captioned: \"All is forgiven\". The issue was also sold outside France. The Digital Innovation Press Fund donated €250,000 to support the magazine, matching a donation by the French Press and Pluralism Fund. The Guardian Media Group pledged £100,000 to the same cause.\n\nOn the night of 8 January, police commissioner Helric Fredou, who had been investigating the attack, committed suicide in his office in Limoges while he was preparing his report shortly after meeting with the family of one of the victims. He was said to have been experiencing depression and burnout.\n\nIn the week after the shooting, 54 anti-Muslim incidents were reported in France. These included 21 reports of shootings, grenade throwing at mosques and other Islamic centers, an improvised explosive device attack, and 33 cases of threats and insults. Authorities classified these acts as right-wing terrorism.\n\nOn 7 January 2016, the one-year anniversary of the shooting, an attempted attack occurred at a police station in the Goutte d'Or district of Paris. The assailant, a Tunisian man posing as an asylum-seeker from Iraq or Syria, charged police officers with a meat cleaver while shouting \"Allahu Akbar!\" and was subsequently shot and killed.\n\nOn 14 February 2015 in Copenhagen, Denmark, a public event called \"Art, blasphemy and the freedom of expression\", was organised to honour victims of the attack in January against the French satirical newspaper \"Charlie Hebdo\". A series of shootings took place that day and the following day in Copenhagen, with two people killed and five police officers wounded. The suspected perpetrator was later shot dead by police on 15 February.\n\nOn 3 May 2015, two men attempted an attack on the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas. The center was hosting an exhibit featuring cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The event was presented as a response to the attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\", and organised by the group American Freedom Defense Initiative (AFDI). Both gunmen were killed by police. A Garland Independent School District police officer was injured by a shot to the ankle but survived.\n\nFollowing the attack, France raised Vigipirate to its highest level: terror alert and deployed soldiers in Paris to the public transport system, media offices, places of worship and the Eiffel Tower. The British Foreign Office warned its citizens about travelling to Paris. The New York City Police Department ordered extra security measures to the offices of the Consulate General of France in New York in Manhattan's Upper East Side as well as the Lycée Français de New York, which was deemed a possible target due to the proliferation of attacks in France as well as the level of hatred of the United States within the extremist community. In Denmark, which was the centre of a controversy over cartoons of Muhammad in 2005, security was increased at all media outlets.\n\nHours after the shooting, Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernández Díaz said that Spain's anti-terrorist security level had been upgraded, and that the country was sharing information with France in relation to the attacks. Spain increased security in public places such as railway stations and increased the police presence on streets throughout the country's cities.\n\nThe British Transport Police confirmed on 8 January that they would establish new armed patrols in and around St Pancras International railway station in London, following reports that the suspects were moving north towards Eurostar stations. They confirmed that the extra patrols were for the reassurance of the public and to maintain visibility and that there were no credible reports yet of the suspects heading towards St Pancras.\n\nIn Belgium, the staff of \"P-Magazine\" were given police protection, although there were no specific threats. \"P-Magazine\" had previously published a cartoon of Muhammad drawn by the Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard.\n\nOn the evening of the day of the attack, demonstrations against the shootings were held at the Place de la République in Paris and in other cities including Toulouse, Nice, Lyon, Marseille and Rennes.\n\nThe phrase \"Je suis Charlie\" (French for \"I am Charlie\") came to be a common worldwide sign of solidarity against the attacks. Many demonstrators used the slogan to express solidarity with the magazine. It appeared on printed and hand-made placards, and was displayed on mobile phones at vigils, and on many websites, particularly media sites such as \"Le Monde\". The hashtag #jesuischarlie quickly trended at the top of Twitter hashtags worldwide following the attack.\n\nNot long after the attack, it is estimated that around 35,000 people gathered in Paris holding \"Je suis Charlie\" signs. 15,000 people also gathered in Lyon and Rennes. 10,000 people gathered in Nice and Toulouse; 7,000 in Marseille; and 5,000 each in Nantes, Grenoble and Bordeaux. Thousands also gathered in Nantes at the Place Royale. More than 100,000 people in total gathered within France to partake in these demonstrations the evening of 7 January.\n\nSimilar demonstrations and candle vigils spread to other cities outside France as well, including Amsterdam, Brussels, Barcelona, Ljubljana, Berlin, Copenhagen, London and Washington, D.C. Around 2,000 demonstrators gathered in London's Trafalgar Square and sang \"La Marseillaise\", the French national anthem. In Brussels, two vigils have been held thus far, one immediately at the city's French consulate and a second one at Place du Luxembourg. Many flags around the city were at half-mast on 8 January. In Luxembourg, a demonstration was held in the Place de la Constitution.\n\nA crowd gathered on the evening of 7 January, at Union Square in Manhattan, New York City. French ambassador to the United Nations François Delattre was present; the crowd lit candles, held signs, and sang the French national anthem. Several hundred people also showed up outside of the French consulate in San Francisco with \"Je suis Charlie\" signs to show their solidarity. In downtown Seattle, another vigil was held where people gathered around a French flag laid out with candles lit around it. They prayed for the victims and held \"Je suis Charlie\" signs. In Argentina, a large demonstration was held to denounce the attacks and show support for the victims outside the French embassy in the Buenos Aires.\n\nMore vigils and gatherings were held in Canada to show support to France and condemn terrorism. Many cities had notable \"Je suis Charlie\" gatherings, including Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. In Calgary, there was a strong anti-terrorism sentiment. \"We're against terrorism and want to show them that they won't win the battle. It's horrible everything that happened, but they won't win,\" commented one demonstrator. \"It's not only against the French journalists or the French people, it's against freedom – everyone, all over the world, is concerned at what's happening.\" In Montreal, despite a temperature of , over 1,000 people gathered chanting \"Liberty!\" and \"Charlie!\" outside of the city's French Consulate. Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre was among the gatherers and proclaimed, \"Today, we are all French!\" He confirmed the city's full support for the people of France and called for strong support regarding freedom, stating that \"We have a duty to protect our freedom of expression. We have the right to say what we have to say.\"\n\nBy 8 January, vigils had spread to Australia, with thousands holding \"Je suis Charlie\" signs. In Sydney, people gathered at Martin Place – the location of a siege less than a month earlier – and in Hyde Park dressed in white clothing as a form of respect. Flags were at half-mast at the city's French consulate where mourners left bouquets. A vigil was held at Federation Square in Melbourne with an emphasis on togetherness. French consul Patrick Kedemos described the gathering in Perth as \"a spontaneous, grass roots event\". He added, \"We are far away but our hearts today [are] with our families and friends in France. It [was] an attack on the liberty of expression, journalists that were prominent in France, and at the same time it's an attack, or a perceived attack on our culture.\"\n\nOn 8 January over 100 demonstrations were held from 18:00 in the Netherlands at the time of the silent march in Paris, after a call to do so from the mayors of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Utrecht, and other cities. Many Dutch government members joined the demonstrations.\n\nAround 700,000 people walked in protest in France on 10 January. Major marches were held in Toulouse (attended by 180,000), Marseille (45,000), Lille (35–40,000), Nice (23–30,000), Pau (80,000), Nantes (75,000), Orléans (22,000), and Caen (6,000).\n\nOn 11 January, up to 2 million people, including President Hollande and more than 40 world leaders, led a rally of national unity in the heart of Paris to honour the 17 victims. The demonstrators marched from Place de la République to Place de la Nation. 3.7 million joined demonstrations nationwide in what officials called the largest public rally in France since World War II.\n\nThere were also large marches in many other French towns and cities, and marches and vigils in many other cities worldwide.\n\nAbout 54 people in France, who had publicly supported the attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\", were arrested as \"apologists for terrorism\" and about 12 people were sentenced to several months in jail. Comedian Dieudonné faces the same charges for having written on Facebook \"I feel like Charlie Coulibaly\".\n\nFollowing a series of police raids in Belgium, in which two suspected terrorists were killed in a shootout in the city of Verviers, Belgian police stated that documents seized after the raids appear to show that the two were planning to attack sellers of the next edition of \"Charlie Hebdo\" released following the attack in Paris. Police named the men killed in the raid as Redouane Hagaoui and Tarik Jadaoun.\n\nUnrest in Niger following the publication of the post-attack issue of \"Charlie Hebdo\" resulted in ten deaths, dozens injured, and at least 45 churches were burned down. \"The Guardian\" reported seven churches burned in Niamey alone. Churches were also reported to be on fire in eastern Maradi and Goure. There were violent demonstrations in Karachi in Pakistan, where Asif Hassan, a photographer working for the Agence France-Presse, was seriously injured by a shot to the chest. In Algiers and Jordan, protesters clashed with police, and there were peaceful demonstrations in Khartoum, Sudan, Russia, Mali, Senegal, and Mauritania. In the week after the shooting, 54 anti-Muslim incidents were reported in France. These included 21 reports of shootings and grenade-throwing at mosques and other Islamic centres and 33 cases of threats and insults.\n\n\"RT\" reported that a million people attended a demonstration in Grozny, the capital city of the Chechen Republic, protesting the depictions of Muhammad in \"Charlie Hebdo\" and proclaiming that Islam is a religion of peace. One of the slogans was \"Violence is not the method\".\n\nOn 8 February 2015 the Muslim Action Forum organised a mass demonstration outside Downing Street in London. Placards read, \"Stand up for the Prophet\" and \"Be careful with Muhammad\".\n\nPresident François Hollande addressed media outlets at the scene of the shooting and called it \"undoubtedly a terrorist attack\", adding that \"several [other] terrorist attacks were thwarted in recent weeks\". He later described the shooting as a \"terrorist attack of the most extreme barbarity\", called the slain journalists \"heroes\", and declared a day of national mourning on 8 January.\n\nAt a rally in the Place de la République in the wake of the shooting, mayor of Paris Anne Hidalgo said, \"What we saw today was an attack on the values of our republic; Paris is a peaceful place. These cartoonists, writers and artists used their pens with a lot of humour to address sometimes awkward subjects and as such performed an essential function.\" She proposed that \"Charlie Hebdo\" \"be adopted as a citizen of honour\" by Paris.\n\nPrime Minister Manuel Valls said that his country was at war with terrorism, but not at war with Islam or Muslims. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said, \"The terrorists' religion is not Islam, which they are betraying. It's barbarity.\"\n\nThe attack received immediate condemnation from dozens of governments worldwide. International leaders including Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, Stephen Harper, Narendra Modi, Benjamin Netanyahu, Angela Merkel, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron, Mark Rutte and Tony Abbott offered statements of condolence and outrage.\n\nSome English-language media outlets republished the cartoons on their websites in the hours following the shootings. Prominent examples included Bloomberg News, \"The Huffington Post\", \"The Daily Beast\", \"Gawker\", \"Vox\", and \"The Washington Free Beacon\".\n\nOther news organisations covered the shootings without showing the drawings, such as \"The New York Times\", \"New York Daily News\", CNN, Al Jazeera America, Associated Press, NBC, MSNBC, and \"The Daily Telegraph\". Accusations of self-censorship came from the websites \"Politico\" and \"Slate\". The BBC, which previously had guidelines against all depictions of Muhammad, showed a depiction of him on a \"Charlie Hebdo\" cover and announced that they were reviewing these guidelines.\n\nOther media publications such as Germany's \"Berliner Kurier\" and Poland's \"Gazeta Wyborcza\" reprinted cartoons from \"Charlie Hebdo\" the day after the attack; the former had a cover of Muhammad reading \"Charlie Hebdo\" whilst bathing in blood. At least three Danish newspapers featured \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoons, and the tabloid \"BT\" used one on its cover depicting Muhammad lamenting being loved by \"idiots\". The German newspaper \"Hamburger Morgenpost\" re-published the cartoons, and their office was fire-bombed. In Russia, \"LifeNews\" and \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" suggested that the US had carried out the attack. \"We are Charlie Hebdo\" appeared on the front page of \"Novaya Gazeta\". Russia's media supervision body, Roskomnadzor, stated that publication of the cartoons could lead to criminal charges.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has sought to harness and direct Muslim anger over the Charlie Hebdo cartoons against the West. Putin is believed to have backed protests by Muslims in Russia against Charlie Hebdo and the West.\n\nIn China, the state-run \"Xinhua\" advocated limiting freedom of speech, while another state-run newspaper, \"Global Times\", said the attack was \"payback\" for what it characterised as Western colonialism.\n\nMedia organisations carried out protests against the shootings. \"Libération\", \"Le Monde\", \"Le Figaro\", and other French media outlets used black banners carrying the slogan \"Je suis Charlie\" across the tops of their websites. The front page of \"Libération\"s printed version was a different black banner that stated, \"\" (\"We are all Charlie\"), while \"Paris Normandie\" renamed itself \"Charlie Normandie\" for the day. The French and UK versions of Google displayed a black ribbon of mourning on the day of the attack.\n\nIan Hislop, editor of the British satirical magazine \"Private Eye\", stated, \"I am appalled and shocked by this horrific attack – a murderous attack on free speech in the heart of Europe. ... Very little seems funny today.\" The editor of \"Titanic\", a German satirical magazine, declared, \"[W]e are scared when we hear about such violence. However, as a satirist, we are beholden to the principle that every human being has the right to be parodied. This should not stop just because of some idiots who go around shooting\". Many cartoonists from around the world responded to the attack on \"Charlie Hebdo\" by posting cartoons relating to the shooting. Among them was Albert Uderzo, who came out of retirement at age 87 to depict his character \"Astérix\" supporting \"Charlie Hebdo\". In Australia, what was considered the iconic national cartoonist's reaction was a cartoon by David Pope in the \"Canberra Times\", depicting a masked, black-clad figure with a smoking rifle standing poised over a slumped figure of a cartoonist in a pool of blood, with a speech balloon showing the gunman saying, \"He drew first.\"\n\nIn India, \"Mint\" ran the photographs of copies of Charlie Hebdo on their cover, but later apologised after receiving complaints from the readers. \"The Hindu\" also issued an apology after it printed a photograph of some people holding copies of Charlie Hebdo. The editor of the Urdu newspaper \"Avadhnama\", Shireen Dalvi, which printed the cartoons faced several police complaints. She was arrested and released on bail. She began to wear the burqa for the first time in her life and went into hiding.\n\nEgyptian daily \"Al-Masry Al-Youm\" featured drawings by young cartoonists signed with \"Je suis Charlie\" in solidarity with the victims. \"Al-Masry al-Youm\" also displayed on their website a slide show of some \"Charlie Hebdo\" cartoons, including controversial ones. This was seen by analyst Jonathan Guyer as a \"surprising\" and maybe \"unprecedented\" move, due to the pressure Arab artists can be subject to when depicting religious figures.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Jewish Journal weekly changed its masthead that week to Jewish Hebdo and published the offending Muhammad cartoons.\n\n\"The Guardian\" reported that many Muslims and Muslim organisations criticised the attack while some Muslims support it and other Muslims stated they would only condemn it if France condemned the killings of Muslims worldwide\". Zvi Bar'el argued in \"Haaretz\" that believing the attackers represented Muslims was like believing that Ratko Mladić represented Christians. Al Jazeera English editor and executive producer Salah-Aldeen Khadr attacked \"Charlie Hebdo\" as the work of solipsists, and sent out a staff-wide e-mail where he argued: \"Defending freedom of expression in the face of oppression is one thing; insisting on the right to be obnoxious and offensive just because you can is infantile.\" The e-mail elicited different responses from within the organisation.\n\nThe Shia Islamic journal \"Ya lasarat Al-Hussein\", founded by Ansar-e Hezbollah, praised the shooting, saying, \"[the cartoonists] met their legitimate justice, and congratulations to all Muslims\" and \"according to fiqh of Islam, punishment of insulting of Muhammad is death penalty\".\n\nReporters Without Borders criticised the presence of leaders from Egypt, Russia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, saying, \"On what grounds are representatives of regimes that are predators of press freedom coming to Paris to pay tribute to \"Charlie Hebdo\", a publication that has always defended the most radical concept of freedom of expression?\"\n\nHacktivist group Anonymous released a statement in which they offered condolences to the families of the victims and denounced the attack as an \"inhuman assault\" on freedom of expression. They addressed the terrorists: \"[a] message for al-Qaeda, the Islamic State and other terrorists – we are declaring war against you, the terrorists.\" As such, Anonymous plans to target jihadist websites and social media accounts linked to supporting Islamic terrorism with the aim of disrupting them and shutting them down.\n\nLebanon, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Bahrain, Morocco, Algeria, and Qatar denounced the incident, as did Egypt's Al-Azhar University, the leading Sunni institution of the Muslim world. Islamic organisations, including the French Council of the Muslim Faith, the Muslim Council of Britain and Islamic Forum of Europe, spoke out against the attack. Sheikh Abdul Qayum and Imam Dalil Boubakeur stated, \"[We] are horrified by the brutality and the savagery.\" The Union of Islamic Organisations of France released a statement condemning the attack, and Imam Hassen Chalghoumi stated that those behind the attack \"have sold their soul to hell\".\n\nThe US-based Muslim civil liberties group, the Council on American–Islamic Relations, condemned the attacks and defended the right to freedom of speech, \"even speech that mocks faiths and religious figures\". The vice president of the US Ahmadiyya Muslim Community condemned the attack, saying, \"The culprits behind this atrocity have violated every Islamic tenet of compassion, justice, and peace.\" The National Council of Canadian Muslims, a Muslim civil liberties organisation, also condemned the attacks.\n\nThe League of Arab States released a collective condemnation of the attack. Al-Azhar University released a statement denouncing the attack, stating that violence was never appropriate regardless of \"offence committed against sacred Muslim sentiments\". The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation condemned the attack, saying that it went against Islam's principles and values.\n\nBoth the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Hamas government of the Gaza Strip stated that \"differences of opinion and thought cannot justify murder\". The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah declared that \"takfiri terrorist groups\" had insulted Islam more than \"even those who have attacked the Prophet\".\n\nMalek Merabet, the brother of Ahmed Merabet, a Muslim police officer killed in the shooting, condemned the terrorists who killed his brother: \"My brother was Muslim and he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims\". Just hours after the shootings, the mayor of Rotterdam, Ahmed Aboutaleb, a Muslim born in Morocco, condemned Islamist extremists living in the West who \"turn against freedom\" and told them to \"fuck off\".\n\nSaudi-Australian Islamic preacher Junaid Thorne said: \"If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise 'freedom of action'.\" Anjem Choudary, a radical British Islamist, wrote an editorial in \"USA Today\" in which he professes justification from the words of Muhammad that those who insult prophets should face death, and that Muhammad should be protected to prevent further violence. Hizb ut-Tahrir Australia said that \"as a result, it is assumed necessary in all cases to ensure that the pressure does not exceed the red lines, which will then ultimately lead to irreversible problems\". Bahujan Samaj Party leader Yaqub Qureishi, a Muslim MLA and former Minister from Uttar Pradesh in India, offered a reward of 510 million (US$8 million) to the perpetrators of the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shootings. On 14 January, about 1,500 Filipino Muslims held a rally in Muslim-majority Marawi in support of the attacks.\n\nAfter the attack, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula praised the attackers for killing Charb, and called for militants to murder others on their hit list. A collection of global jihadist organisations condemned the cartoonists and praised the killers, including the Taliban in Afghanistan, Al-Shabaab, a militant Islamist organisation in Somalia, as well as Boko Haram of Nigeria. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) militants in Syria also praised the massacre.\n\nTwo Islamist newspapers in Turkey ran headlines that were criticised on social media as justifying the attack. The \"Yeni Akit\" ran an article entitled \"Attack on the magazine that provoked Muslims\", and \"Türkiye\" ran an article entitled \"Attack on the magazine that insulted our Prophet\". Yahoo Canada reported a rally in support of the shootings in southern Afghanistan, where the demonstrators called the gunmen \"heroes\" who meted out punishment for the disrespectful cartoons. The demonstrators also protested Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's swift condemnation of the shootings. Around 40 to 60 people gathered in Peshawar, Pakistan, to praise the killers, with a local cleric holding a funeral for the killers, lionizing them as \"heroes of Islam.\"\n\n\"Le Figaro\" reported that in a Seine-Saint-Denis primary school, up to 80% of the pupils refused to participate in the minute of silence that the French government decreed for schools. A student told a teacher, \"I'll drop you with a Kalashnikov, mate.\" Other teachers were told \"Charlie Hebdo\" \"had it coming\", and \"Me, I'm for the killers\". One teacher requested to be transferred.\nThey also reported that students from a vocational school in Senlis tried to attack and beat students from a neighbouring school while saying \"we will kill more Charlie Hebdos\". The incident is being investigated by authorities who are handling 37 proceedings of \"terrorism glorification\" and 17 proceedings of threats of violence in schools.\n\n\"La Provence\" reported that a fight broke out in the l'Arc à Orange high school during the minute of silence, as a result of a student post on a social network welcoming the atrocities. The student was later penalised for posting the message. \"Le Point\" reported on the \"provocations\" at a grade school in Grenoble, and cited a girl who said \"Madame, people won't let the insult of a drawing of the prophet pass by, it is normal to take revenge. This is more than a joke, it's an insult!\"\n\n\"Le Monde\" reported that the majority of students they met at Saint-Denis condemned the attack. For them, life is sacred, but so is religion. Marie-Hélène, age 17, said \"I didn't really want to stand for the one minute silence, I didn't think it was right to pay homage to a man who insulted Islam and other religions too\". Abdul, age 14, said \"of course everyone stood for the one minute silence, and that includes all Muslims... I did it for those who were killed, but not for Charlie. I have no pity for him, he had no respect for us Muslims\". It also reported that for most students at the Paul Eluard high school in Saint-Denis, freedom of expression is perceived as being \"incompatible with their faith\". For Erica, who describes herself as Catholic, \"there are wrongs on both sides\". A fake bomb was planted in the faculty lounge at the school.\n\nFrance Télévisions reported that a fourth-grade student told her teacher, \"We will not be insulted by a drawing of the prophet, it is normal that we take revenge.\" It also reported that the fake bomb contained the message \"I Am Not Charlie\".\n\nThe Head of the Chechen Republic, Ramzan Kadyrov, said \"we will not allow anyone to insult the prophet, even if it costs us our lives.\"\n\nSalman Rushdie, who is on the Al-Qaeda hit list and received death threats over his novel \"The Satanic Verses\", said, \"I stand with \"Charlie Hebdo\", as we all must, to defend the art of satire, which has always been a force for liberty and against tyranny, dishonesty and stupidity ... religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today.\"\n\nSwedish artist Lars Vilks, also on the Al-Qaeda hit list for publishing his own satirical drawings of Muhammad, condemned the attacks and said that the terrorists \"got what they wanted. They've scared people. People were scared before, but with this attack fear will grow even larger\" and that the attack \"expose[s] the world we live in today\".\n\nAmerican journalist David Brooks wrote an article titled \"I Am Not Charlie Hebdo\" in \"The New York Times\", arguing that the magazine's humor was childish, but necessary as a voice of satire. He also criticised many of those in America who were ostensibly voicing support for free speech, noting that were the cartoons to be published in an American university newspaper, the editors would be accused of \"hate speech\" and the university would \"have cut financing and shut them down.\" He called on the attacks to be an impetus toward tearing down speech codes.\n\nAmerican linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky views the popularisation of the \"Je suis Charlie\" slogan by politicians and media in the West as hypocritical, comparing the situation to the NATO bombing of the Radio Television of Serbia headquarters in 1999, when 16 employees were killed. \"There were no demonstrations or cries of outrage, no chants of 'We are RTV' [...]\", he noted. Chomsky also mentioned other incidents where US military forces have caused higher civilian death tolls, without leading to intensive reactions such as those that followed the 2015 Paris attacks.\n\nGerman politician Sahra Wagenknecht, the deputy leader of the party Die Linke in the German Parliament, has compared the US drone attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan or Yemen with the terrorist attacks in Paris. ″If a drone controlled by the West extinguishes an innocent Arab or Afghan family, which is just a despicable crime as the attacks in Paris, and it should fill us with the same sadness and the same horror\". We should not operate a double standard. Through the drone attacks had been \"murdered thousands of innocent people\", in the concerned countries, this created helplessness, rage and hatred: \"Thereby we prepare the ground for the terror, we officially want to fight.\" The politician stressed that this war is also waged from German ground. Regarding the Afghanistan war with German participation for years, she said: \"Even the Bundeswehr is responsible for the deaths of innocent people in Afghanistan.\" As the most important consequence of the terrorist attacks in Paris, Wagenknecht demanded the end of all military operations of the West in the Middle East.\n\nBill Donohue, president of the US Catholic League, said \"Charlie Hebdo\" had a \"long and disgusting record\" of mocking religious figures and that Charb \"didn't understand the role he played in his tragic death. ... Had he not been so narcissistic, he may still be alive.\"\n\nCartoonist-journalist Joe Sacco expressed grief for the victims in a comic strip, and wrote but ... tweaking the noses of Muslims ... has never struck me as anything other than a vapid way to use the pen ... I affirm our right to \"take the piss\" ... but we can try to think why the world is the way it is ... and [retaliating with violence against Muslims] is going to be far easier than sorting out how we fit in each other's world.\nJapanese famous film director, Hayao Miyazaki expressed his opinion about the attack and gave his opinion about the magazine decision to publish the content cited as the trigger for the incident. He said, \"I think it's a mistake to caricaturize the figures venerated by another culture. You shouldn't do it.\" He assert, \"Instead of doing something like that, you should first make caricatures of your own country's politicians.\"\n\nFrench Minister of the Interior Bernard Cazeneuve declared that by the morning of 9 January 2015, a total of 3,721 messages \"condoning the attacks\" had already been documented through the French government Pharos system.\n\nIn an open letter titled \"To the Youth in Europe and North America\", Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urged young people in Europe and North America not to judge Islam by the attacks, but to seek their own understanding of the religion. Holly Dagres of Al-Monitor wrote that Khamenei’s followers \"actively spammed Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+ and even Tumblr with links\" to the letter with the aim of garnering the attention of people in the West.\n\n\n"}

Her ex-husband is President Park's former chief of staff Chung Yoon-hoi, and their daughter is dressage athlete Chung Yoo-ra.\n\nChoi Soon-sil was born on June 23, 1956 as the 5th daughter in Choi Tae-min’s family. Her mother’s name is Im Sun-ie (임선이). She entered Dankook University in 1975, but was reported as an auditor. She married Kim Young-ho (김영호) in 1982 and had a son in 1983. They divorced in 1986. She married Choi Tae-min’s former secretary Chung Yoon-hoi in 1995 and had a daughter named Chung Yoo-ra. Soon-sil and Yoon-hoi divorced in 2014.\n\nChoi’s relationship with Park Geun-hye is estimated to trace back to 1977. At that time, the National College Student Union, which started from a new mindset to “establish an uptight identity, a determined patriotism and an independent value system”, was founded, and Choi was the president. On June 10, 1977, the union held an opening meeting in Hanyang University. During this event the governor of the Saemaul peace corps was sitting on Park Geun-hye’s right side and President Lee Myung-bak was sitting on her left side.\n\nAfter the 1980s, Choi started managing real estate business and operating kindergartens. In 1983, she acquired 45-pyong (about 149 square meters) of land in Yeoksam-dong, Seoul; in September 1985, she acquired 108-pyong (about 347 square meters) of land in Sinsa-dong and built a 4-story building. A kindergarten used to be operated in this building. In July 1988, she bought a 200-pyong (about 661 square meters) space of land in Sinsa-dong under a joint-contract with someone else. Later, she bought back the joint shares and became the sole owner of the property. From 1992 to 1996, Choi established and operated Jubel GmbH jointly with Chung Yoon-hoi. In July 2003, a building (referred to as M building) with 7 floors above ground and 2 floors underground was constructed with Choi’s investment. Chung Yoon-hoi’s company was a tenant in this building. In February 2008, Choi sold the kindergarten building to a savings bank. In 1989, Choi translated a child-care instruction book called “How To Hold Your Children’s Habit Upright ” with Kim Kwang-Ung (김광웅). This book introduced Choi as the vice president of research center affiliated to the Korea Institute of Culture.\n\nIn 2006, Park was attacked by a person with a razor when attending the election campaign for the Seoul mayor as the representative of Grand National Party (now known as Saenuri Party). Choi Soon-sil looked after Park when she was hospitalized. After leaving hospital, Park continued to receive treatment at Choi Soon-sil’s older sister Choi Soon-deuk’s house.\n\nIt is confirmed that Choi operates a cafe and an Italian restaurant “Testa Rossa\" in Nonhyeon-dong (in Gangnam-gu, Seoul). The remodeled building has been running since December 2014 (with the first and second floor selling various drinks and sandwiches while the third floor is Choi’s private office.) An insider gave testimony saying that Choi has been contacting and meeting with politicians, influential businessmen and business tycoons on the 2nd and 3rd floors of this building.\n\nThe scandal involves allegations that she was responsible for masterminding governmental policy and decision making during Park's administration. Prosecutors have raided offices and homes linked to Choi. Park's secretaries have been ordered to resign following the scandal. She may have ordered Korean prosecutors to indict a Japanese journalist, Tatsuya Kato (Seoul Bureau chief of \"Sankei Shimbun\"), for defamation for reporting that President Park and Chung Yoon-hoi had a secret seven-hour meeting with Choi after the sinking of MV Sewol.\n\nOn October 31, Choi met with prosecutors, telling reporters “Please, forgive me. I’m sorry. I committed a sin that deserves death”.\n\nAs of November 20, Choi Soon-sil was officially charged by the prosecutors for intervening in state affairs and forcing chaebols to donate tens of millions of dollars to foundations and businesses over which she had control.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, the Seoul Central District Court found Choi guilty and sentenced her to three years of imprisonment on charges on obstruction of duty by using her presidential ties to get her daughter admitted to Ewha Womans University and receive good grades.\n\nOn 13 February 2018, the Seoul Central District Court found Choi guilty for abuse of power, bribery and interfering in government business and sentenced her to 20 years in prison and a fine of ₩18 billion ($16.6 million USD).\n\n \n"}
{"id": "888692", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=888692", "title": "Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja", "text": "Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja\n\nThe Chronicle of the Priest of Dioclea or Duklja () is the usual name given to an alleged medieval chronicle written by an anonymous priest from Duklja. Its oldest preserved copy is from the 17th century, while it has been variously claimed by modern historians to have been compiled between the late 12th and early 15th century. Historians have largely discounted the work based on inaccuracies and fiction, nevertheless it contains some semi-mythological material on the early history of the Western South Slavs. The section of \"The Life of St. Jovan Vladimir\", is however believed to be a novelization of an earlier work.\n\nThe work was allegedly made by an anonymous \"priest of Duklja\" (\"presbyter Diocleas\", known in Serbian as \"pop Dukljanin\"). The work is only preserved in its Latin redactions from the 17th century. Serbian historian Tibor Živković, in the monograph \"Gesta regum Sclavorum\", concluded that its main parts dated to ca. 1300–10. Dmine Papalić, a nobleman from Split, found the text which he transcribed in 1509–10, which was then translated by Marko Marulić into Latin in 1510, with the title \"Regnum Dalmatiae et Croatiae gesta\". Mavro Orbin, a Ragusan historian, included the work (amongst other works) in his \"Il regno de gli Slavi\" (ca. 1601); Johannes Lucius did the same in ca. 1666. These Latin redactions claim that the original was written in Slavic.\n\nThe chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 in the town of Bar (in Montenegro), then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was \"presbyter\" Rudger (or Rudiger), the Catholic Archbishop of Bar (\"Antivari\"), who was probably of Czech origin. He is thought to have lived around 1300 because the perception of Bosnian borders coincides with an anonymous text, the \"Anonymi Descriptio Europae Orientalis\" (Cracow, 1916), that has been dated to the year 1308. Latest research shows that he flourished in ca. 1296–1300.\n\nChapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians. However, the next three chapters possess invaluable historical data about this time period. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 (on Saint Jovan Vladimir), a summary of an older hagiography dating between 1075 and 1089 (when the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric), contains a lot of reliable historical data. The previous two chapters, Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of this 11th-century hagiography.\n\nOther, obsolete and refuted theories include that the author lived in the second half of the 12th century. Some Croatian historians put forward the theory, of E. Peričić (1991), that the anonymous author was a \"Grgur Barski\" (Gregory of Bar), a bishop of Bar who lived in the second half of the 12th century. The bishopric of Bar was in fact defunct at that time. In his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Mijušković stated that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century.\n\n\"Regnum Sclavorum\" (1601) can be divided into the following sections:\n\nThe author attempted to present an overview of ruling families over the course of over two centuries — from the 10th century up to the time of writing, the 12th century. There are 47 chapters in the text, of different sizes and varying subject matter.\n\nThe work is actually a number of separate but similar manuscripts, stemming from an original source that does not survive but assumed to have been written by the Priest of Duklja himself (or other monk-scribes giving a helping hand).\n\nIt has been generally agreed that this Presbyter included in his work folklore and literary material from Slavic sources which he translated into Latin. Among the material he translated, rather than created, is \"The Legend of Prince Vladimir\" which is supposed to have been written by another clergyman, also from Duklja, more specifically, Zečanin from Krajina in Zeta or Duklja (an earlier name for Zeta). In its original version, it was a hagiographic work, a \"Life of St. Vladimir\" rather than a \"Legend.\" Prince Vladimir, the protagonist of the story, as well as King Vladislav, who ordered Vladimir's execution, were historical persons, yet \"The Legend of Prince Vladimir\" contains non-historical material.\n\nThe chronicle was also added to by a bishop of Bar intent on demonstrating his diocese' superiority over that of Bishop of Split.\n\nVarious inaccurate or simply wrong claims in the text make it an unreliable source. Modern historians have serious doubts about the majority of this work as being mainly fictional, or wishful thinking. Some go as far as to say that it can be dismissed in its entirety, but that is not a majority opinion, rather, it is thought to have given us a unique insight into the whole era from the point of view of the indigenous Slavic population and it is still a topic of discussion.\n\nThe work describes the local Slavs as a peaceful people imported by the Goth rulers, who invaded the area in the 5th century, but it doesn't attempt to elaborate on how and when this happened. This information contradicts the information found in the Byzantine text \"De Administrando Imperio\".\n\nThe \"Chronicle\" also mentions one Svetopeleg or Svetopelek, the eighth descendant of the original Goth invaders, as the main ruler of the lands that cover Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro (Duklja) and Serbia. He is also credited with the Christianization of the people who are Goths or Slavs — a purely fictitious attribution. These claims about a unified kingdom are probably a reflection of the earlier glory of the Moravian kingdom. He may also have been talking about Avars.\n\nThe priest's parish was located at the seat of the archbishopric of Duklja. According to Bishop Gregory's late 12th-century additions to this document, this Archbishopric covered much of the western Balkans including the bishoprics of Bar, Budva, Kotor, Ulcinj, Svač, Skadar, Drivast, Pulat, Travunia, Zahumlje.\n\nFurther, it mentions Bosnia (Bosnam) and Rascia (Rassa) as the two Serbian lands, while describing the southern Dalmatian Hum/\"Zahumlje\", Travunia and Dioclea (most of today's Herzegovina, Montenegro, as well as parts of Croatia and Albania) as Croatian lands (\"Red Croatia\"), which is a description inconsistent with all other historical works from the same period.\n\nThe archbishop of Bar was later named \"Primas Serbiae\". Ragusa had some claims to be considered the natural ecclesiastical centre of South Dalmatia but those of Dioclea (Bar) to this new metropolitan status were now vigorously pushed especially as the Pope intended Serbia to be attached to Dioclea.\n\nIn his 1967 reprint of the work, Yugoslav historian Slavko Mijušković stated that the chronicle is a purely fictional literary product, belonging to the late 14th or early 15th century.\n\nThe region of Bosnia is described to span the area west of the river Drina, \"up to the Pine mountain\" (, ). The location of this Pine mountain is unknown.\nIn 1881, Croatian historian Franjo Rački wrote that this refers to the mountain of \"Borova glava\" near the Livno field.\nCroatian historian Luka Jelić wrote the mountain was located either between Maglaj and Skender Vakuf, northwest of Žepče, or it was the mountain Borovina located between Vranica and Radovan, according to Ferdo Šišić's 1908 work.\nIn 1935, Serbian historian Vladimir Ćorović wrote that the toponym refers to the mountain of Borova glava, because of etymology and because it is located on the watershed (drainage divide).\nIn 1936, Slovene ethnologist Niko Županič had also interpreted that to mean that the western border of Bosnia was at some drainage divide mountains, but placed it to the southeast of Dinara.\nCroatian historian Anto Babić, based on the work of Dominik Mandić in 1978, inferred that the term refers roughly to a place of the drainage divide between the Sava and Adriatic Sea watersheds.\nIn her discussion of Ćorović, Serbian historian Jelena Mrgić-Radojčić also points to the existence of a mountain of \"Borja\" in today's northern Bosnia with the same etymology.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "36082813", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36082813", "title": "Concussions in American football", "text": "Concussions in American football\n\nConcussions and other types of repetitive play-related head blows in American football have been shown to be the cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, depression, anxiety, headaches, and also sleep disturbances.\n\nThe list of ex-NFL players that have either been diagnosed \"post-mortem\" with CTE or have reported symptoms of CTE continues to grow.\n\nAccording to the Boston University CTE Center, CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood; it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.\n\nA concussion, from the Latin word \"concussio\", is a frequent injury among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury. There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s. In 1906, a Harvard student athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled \"The Physical Aspect of American Football\" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.\n\nThe NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed rheumatologist Elliot Pellman to chair the committee. Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or neuropsychologist and often admitted ignorance about head injuries. The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent. The league legal representation has been shown to have had ties to the tobacco industry legal defense. \n\nThe same year, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts. Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.\n\nThe MTBI Committee began studying the nature of tackle plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain. It started publishing study results in 2003 that stated there were no long-term negative health consequences associated with concussions sustained by NFL players. A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, \"Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.\"\n\nOther organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina, for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the Center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.\n\nA 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.\n\nDuring November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.\n\nIn addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the Committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the American College of Sports Medicine noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled \"Doctor Yes,\" Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the \"... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them.\"\n\nMore studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. Kevin Guskiewicz, Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from clinical depression, with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions. The following year, the NFL commissioned the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, researchers with Boston University announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE. As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94. A study published in \"The Journal of the American Medical Association\" in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE.\n\nIn October 2009, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL Concussion Committee were called before Congress to defend their policies against allegations of neglect. Goodell provided testimony, but was unable to answer many questions, as none of the primary authors of the league's research, Ira Casson, David Viano, or Elliot Pellman were present. As a result of this incident and pressure from the NFL Players Association, the NFL released a comprehensive overhaul of the league concussion policy in November and December 2009. The policy expanded the list of symptoms that would prevent a player from returning to a game or practice on the same day their injury occurred.\n\nWith continued pressure to protect players, the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to Detroit Lions running back Jahvid Best in . Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the NFL Draft due to their past concussion history. According to an Outside the Lines report, the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League, although Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said the system is functional. The technology could detect and measure the impact of blows to the head in real time during a game, but no such measurement exists in the league at this time. Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst Hines Ward stated the use of the system would be \"opening a Pandora's Box,\" and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.\n\nIn November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the \"Journal of Neurosurgery\" in which various football helmets were compared with each other via crash test dummies. It was also found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.\n\nWhen a football player sustains a concussion in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:\n\nBefore the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline neurological and physical exam. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season. The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.\n\nCurrent NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and athletic trainers to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call \"medical timeouts\" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the 2011 season.\n\nIf a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.\n\nAfter a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medial staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline cognitive function. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.\n\nThe NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained \"remarkably the same over the course of four years.\" The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in \"Neurosurgery\" that \"NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury.\" Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes \"Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.\" However, when Dr. Bennet Omalu examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster, he discovered a new brain disease, which he called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in \"Neurosurgery\" in July 2005. The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler Terry Long. Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname \"Dr. No.\" In September 2009, \"The New York Times\" published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, \"the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys.\" Two months later, Aiello told \"New York Times\" reporter Alan Schwarz that \"it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems.\" It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.\n\nThings got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters Steve Fainaru and his brother Mike Fainaru-Wada learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded \"disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries - even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage.\" One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005, three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. \"That same year,\" write the Fainuru brothers, \"the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal \"Neurosurgery.\" The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.'\"\n\nSince Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL In a roundtable discussion with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that \"there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\" However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that \"the NFL rescinded a gift to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image.\" The N.F.L had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.\n\nTo mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness. Additionally, new rules regarding \"crown of the helmet\" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box so as to protect players' heads. Lastly, the NFL and USA Football launched the Heads Up Football initiative, which \"emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game.\" A mobile application was also launched with help from the CDC where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.\n\nThe PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University and former college football player says, \"In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving,\" but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations \"might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport.\" Boland says this in light of Pop Warner football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.\n\nIn April 2011, attorneys Sol H. Weiss and Larry E. Coben from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Ray Easterling, Jim McMahon and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.\n\nThe multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Anita B. Brody presides over the matter. The master administrative long-form complaint, filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and Christopher Seeger on June 7, 2012, alleges the League \"... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels.\" The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering \"... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, depression, deficits in cognitive functioning, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ('CTE').\"\n\nIn April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home. An autopsy report concluded Easterling's brain had evidence of CTE, a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head.\n\nOne month later, former San Diego Chargers player Junior Seau also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.\n\nLike Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety Dave Duerson's brain after he committed suicide earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.\n\nThe autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions. Neuropathologist Bennet Omalu has identified CTE in the autopsies of former players Mike Webster, Terry Long, Justin Strzelczyk, Andre Waters, and Chris Henry. One of the difficult issues facing doctors is attempting to identify mental health effects from concussions during the lives of former players rather than after their deaths. In April 2012, a group of former Dallas Cowboys—including Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Randy White, Bob Lilly, and Rayfield Wright (among other retired players from around the league)—filed a lawsuit against the NFL, again accusing it of ignoring a link between concussions and brain injury.\n\nIn August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, Travelers ultimately sued the League on August 21 in a lawsuit called Discover Property & Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The company provided liability coverage for the League's merchandising arm (NFL Properties), and the insurer also pointed out that the above-mentioned lawsuit has allegedly 14 counts against the League, while only two against NFL Properties.\n\nAfter quarterbacks Jay Cutler, Michael Vick and Alex Smith sustained concussions in Week 10 of the 2012 season, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) reiterated their plans to have independent neurologists on the sidelines at every game. The 2013-14 NFL season involved an independent neurological consultant per team on the sideline of every game. Concussion guidelines released by the NFL in 2013, mandated a four-stage protocol for concussions, including examinations, treatment and monitoring prior to a return to play. In March 2013, the League proposed a rule to reduce concussions by making it illegal for a ball carrier or tackler to \"initiate forcible contact by delivering a blow with the top crown of his helmet against an opponent when both players are clearly outside of the tackle box.\" However, the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs Matt Forte, Emmitt Smith and Marshall Faulk.\n\nA federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013 in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013 regarding the results of the mediation.\n\nA proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.\n\nThe settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.\n\nThe settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.\n\n\"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents,\" attorney Weiss said.\n\nThe settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.\n\nThe NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a \"Trigger\" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The \"exposure\" trigger, the \"manifestation\" trigger, the \"injury-in-fact\" trigger, and the \"continuous\" trigger. Reiter, Thomas M., and Lucas J. Tanglen. \"CONCUSSIONS AND COVERAGE: INSURANCE FOR CLAIMS ALLEGING LONG-TERM BRAIN INJURIES, INCLUDING CTE.\" The Entertainment and Sports Lawyer, Fall 2017, p. 3+. Academic OneFile, http://link.galegroup.com.ezproxy.jccc.edu/apps/doc/A538725148/AONE?u=jcl_jccc&sid=AONE&xid=30b67d72. Accessed 29 Nov. 2018.\n\nOn December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the Kansas City Chiefs organization: former Chiefs players Alexander Cooper, Leonard Griffin, Christopher Martin, Joe Phillips, and Kevin Porter. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.\n\nThis lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1993 there was no Collective Bargaining Agreement established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. \"I think all of our clients were disappointed,\" McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL. The players currently suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.\n\nA law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, \"The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time.\"\n\nThe amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.\n\nOn December 1, 2012, Jovan Belcher, current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkin's daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher \"suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion.\" However, one lawsuit continues, \"despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery.\" The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.\n\nOn September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nOn March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back Paul Oliver sued helmet-maker Riddell along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois. Shortly thereafter, NFL hall of fame running back and Super Bowl champion Paul Hornung, represented by The Brad Sohn Law Firm and Corboy & Demetrio, filed a related case against these defendants. Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science. Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed. The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.\n\nThe NCAA, like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions. In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety. Both Owens and Rucks claimed that they had suffered brain trauma which could have been prevented. In 2012, the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten Conference began work on preventing concussions, and appointed University of Mississippi Chancellor Dan Jones to evaluate and review existing research and various diagnoses from past analyses. In 2009, an NCAA panel created and recommended a rule that prevents an athlete from returning to a game after he/she has sustained a concussion. The panel also had recommended for an athlete to be sidelined after any concussion-related injury until he/she has been cleared by a doctor. Under the new plan, all student-athletes must sign statements saying that they will report all signs and symptoms of concussions to their coaches. In addition, all athletes must have baseline cognitive testing while the post-injury cognitive testing is strongly recommended. The athletes diagnosed with concussions must be removed from sports for a minimum of one day and can only return when decided by a team physician.\n\nIn the 2010 season for the Canadian Football League, there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one. However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010. The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of Football Canada, Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), the Canadian School Sport Federation, the Canadian Football League Players Association (CFLPA), the Canadian Football League Alumni Association (CFLAA), and the ThinkFirst program. The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:\n\nIn 2012, ThinkFirst founder and Toronto Western Hospital neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the University of Toronto, which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.\n\nIn the Arena Football League, despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former Colorado Crush kicker Clay Rush in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games. Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing. In 2008, during the original league's final season, the \"Shockometer\" made its debut at two season-opening games (Dallas Desperados vs. Georgia Force/San Jose SaberCats vs. Chicago Rush) on 40 player helmets. The device is projected to sell for $30 if it is to become available on the market. The players that were given the device play positions that are suspectible to hard hits, such as wide receivers, defensive backs, running backs, and linebackers. AFL Players Association regional director James Guidry stated that the red light doesn't mean that the player has a concussion, but as a warning for team examiners to inspect the player. Guidry also said that the device could be used to prevent players who do not want to show any signs of weakness after sustaining any concussion-like symptoms from continuing to play.\n\nYouth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital. Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.\n\nA study conducted from 2010-2104 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may effect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. Theses figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population {ages 7-18).  \n\nOne of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from Virginia Tech, receiving permission from parents, placed accelerometers (which measure g forces) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium Riddell Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, battery, and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.\n\nAs way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and concussion begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a soccer ball, and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.\n\nThis 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.\n\nA Virginia Tech doctor stated that reducing the number of higher hits during practice sessions constitutes a real opportunity. Of the 38 impacts of 40g or greater, 29 took place during practice. And of the six impacts greater than 80g, all took place during practice.\n\nOne Pop Warner game in particular in 2012 resulted in five concussions. In 2015, a family sued Pop Warner over the suicide of a former player who was later found to have CTE, claiming that the organization knew or should have known about the risk of head injuries. Several other lawsuits have been filed against Pop Warner for related cases.\n\nThe Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the \"Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports.\" It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion. Heads up provides important information on preventing, recognizing and responding to a concussion. 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious, 72% said they are educating others about concussions, and 50% had learned something new.\n\nConcussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures. About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.\n\nMany concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete health at serious risk. A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field. Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players. Of those students, 30 reported having suffered a concussion. More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would \"always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury,\" and only 54 percent indicated they would \"always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach.\" Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day. Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services, there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face.\n\nEleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.\n\nNumerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives. One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football League's 2008 season known as the \"Shockometer\"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a g-force which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device. Riddell created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit. Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the season, but it was ultimately not used. In 2013, Reebok developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a quarter-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard. Similarly to Reebok's Impact Indicator, Battle Sport Science has released the Impact Indicator 2.0. The Impact Indicator 2.0 looks to increase long-term brain safety for all those who play football. On February 3, 2013, the NFL and General Electric partnered on a five-year, $50 million project to develop technology to predict brain injuries, show injury severity and the rate of recovery, and to create more protective material. There is now another company that has taken on the responsibility of attempting to limit the number of concussions in the game of football. Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously. Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, \"You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are.\" In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season. Concussion-preventing technology continues to improve the safety in the game of football.\n\nThe National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.\n\nIn 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from \"launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck.\" Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.\n\nAlso in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.\n\nThe Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.\n\nTo reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that \"more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules.\"\n\nThe most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.\n\nIn 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.\n\nOn March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013-2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.\n\nAfter three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in concussions even after making several improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.\n\nIn the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks. In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing Russell Wilson to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment. The Seattle Seahawks failed to have Wilson cleared by a team doctor and an independent physician before allowing him to return to the game. The NFL investigated the incident and imposed a $100,000 fine on the Seahawks.\n\nThe Women's Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.\n\nfrom 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.\n\nReturn to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009. All 50 states, including Washington D.C, have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013 to the U.S. Senate. This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the \"when in doubt, sit it out\" policy to be used with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play. A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.\n\nIn 2016, the Pop Warner league banned kickoffs in an attempt to reduce high-speed collisions that result in concussions.\n\nIn September 2015, researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.\n\nAs of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the FDA for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.\n\nTo date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.\n\nSmall and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.\nThe injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.\n\nThe findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.\n\nBased on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols. \n\nConcussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or week and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still won't be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.\n\nResearchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, \"Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in CTE\".\n\nPost-Concussive Symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training \"A physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion\" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.\n\nThere has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). \"The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery\". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process. Wu, Yi-Ning, \"Stable recovery after aerobic exercise with limb blood flow restriction and cooling in individuals with post-concussion syndrome\", Physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics of North America, p. 437-54. 2016.</ref>==\nSee also\n\nAs of 2011, all 32 NFL teams are required to have at least one Physical Therapist on staff. Physical Therapist can help with current and former NFL players that have experienced a concussion. A Vestibular Physical Therapist can create customize treatment for dizziness and balance dysfunction associated with a concussion.\n\n\n"}

Sponsored by Celcom and Yonder Music, the free concert was only available exclusively to Celcom users who are subscribers of the Yonder Music mobile app. It was held on 2 April 2016 and she was supported and accompanied by five Malaysian artists and three Indonesian artists. Staged at Stadium Negara, the supporting acts during the night of the concert were Faizal Tahir, Hafiz Suip, Jaclyn Victor, Joe Flizzow, and SonaOne of Malaysia and Afgansyah Reza, Anggun, and Cakra Khan from Indonesia.\n\nMost of the songs that were performed at the concert were taken from her own repertoire. The selected songs were performed either by Siti on her own or as a duet or as a group with the supporting artists. She also performed for the first time a \"digital duet\" with Whitney Houston for the song \"Memories\". The concert was a success with more than 7000 attendees came to watch the concert. It received positive feedback and reviews from concert reviewers and critics who praised Siti's vocals and overall showmanship.\n\nFew days after the concert was staged, the concert's live album was available for exclusive streaming on the Yonder Music mobile app.\n\nThe news of the concert was first announced by Siti on 20 January 2016 during her 37th birthday celebration. She originally decided to take a break from performing for major concerts in 2016. However, she decided to postpone her rest after she was approached by Yonder Music with the idea and the offer of organizing a special concert for her. She also revealed that this concert will be her last before an extended hiatus until July 2016 so that she can focus on her personal life after experiencing a miscarriage in 2015. In the original plan, the concert was supposed to take place at the Plenary Hall of Kuala Lumpur Convention Center (KLCC) on 5 and 6 March 2016. However, after a follow-up meeting with the main organizers of the concert, the concert was later rescheduled to 2 April 2016. The final date for the concert was also chosen to coincide with the celebration of her 20th year involvement in the music industry.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, during the concert's first press conference, more details about the concert were revealed. Unlike the original plan, the concert will only be held on a single day, 2 April 2016. It will be also staged at Stadium Negara instead of KLCC. Billed as \"Datuk Siti Nurhaliza & Friends\", five supporting acts from Malaysia and Indonesia were also announced. Accompanied by Faizal Tahir and Hafiz Suip, two Malaysian singers who will be supporting her during the concert, the organizers also announced the involvement of three Indonesian singers who will be sharing the stage with Siti: Afgansyah Reza, Anggun, and Cakra Khan. Sponsored by Celcom and Yonder Music, tickets for the concert were not available for sale. The free concert was set to be only available exclusively for 6000 chosen Celcom users who are subscribers of the Yonder Music mobile app. \n\nOn 23 March, a second press conference for the concert was held. After receiving an overwhelming response from the public, the seating arrangement for the concert was revised so that it can fit an additional 1000 people, making the final number is 7000 people. Yonder Music also decided to add two more guest Malaysian artists who will be Siti's supporting acts – Joe Flizzow and SonaOne. She also will be accompanied by The Gotham All-Stars band and a 47-piece orchestra throughout the concert.\n\nPromotions for the concert were mostly done in late March. These were including an appearance by Siti on various electronic media. Some of the radio stations that she visited were Fly FM and Hot FM. She also made various appearances on a number of television programs including MeleTOP and hLive on a number of channels of Astro pay television services. She also appeared on TV3's morning television show, Malaysia Hari Ini for the promotion of the concert.\n\n\"Dato' Siti Nurhaliza & Friends Concert\" marked Siti Nurhaliza's first concert to be organized at Stadium Merdeka, an enclosed indoor arena. Her makeup for the night was provided by Nurul Shukor while her dresses were designed and created by Rizman Ruzaini. Rizman Nordin of the Rizman Ruzaini duo revealed that he was asked by Yonder Music to create \"outstanding\" dresses for Siti for the night. According to him, the original colour theme for Siti's dresses was red per the request by the organizer. However, he decided that gold should also be included in the dresses' palette to make Siti more outstanding.\n\nThe designs for all three dresses were entrusted by Siti to the duo. For the first dress, they used a red net cloth that comes with motifs sewn into it. For the second dress, inspired from the first time Siti worked with them, they used red lace and net to make the dress. For the final dress, which was a striped sequin gold dress with a red base and side panels, they used fabrics that are full of sequins to make it. Few adjustments were done to the designs after they saw her during the full rehearsals of the concert, including changing the colours of her tudungs. All three dresses were made from imported fabrics and materials. It took them three weeks to finish designing and creating all the dresses.\n\n\"Dato' Siti Nurhaliza & Friends Concert\" has three main segments. The first segment saw her performing her songs as \"unplugged\" while the second and her last segment saw her being accompanied by a live band and a full orchestra respectively. The two-hour concert began close to 9 p.m. with an opening dance routine by a young girl which is said \"to represent Siti as a young girl who dreamt of becoming an entertainer\". Siti later appeared on the stage to begin the \"unplugged\" segment of her concert with the acoustic rendition of \"Aku Cinta Padamu\". She later performed \"Percayalah\", \"Jaga Dia Untukku\", and \"Terbaik Bagimu\".\n\nIn the next segment with live band, accompanied by Sonaone and Joe Flizzow, she performed a medley of her upbeat songs – \"Ku Mahu\", \"Ku Milikmu\", and \"Destinasi Cinta\". She later invited on stage Anggun to perform a duet with Anggun's own song, \"Snow on the Sahara\". They later sang together Siti's own song, \"Bukan Cinta Biasa\". She closed the live band segment with \"Cindai\", her traditional song that was reworked with a more modern music arrangement for the concert.\n\nFor the second half of the concert, she was accompanied by a full orchestra for the remaining songs of the set list. The orchestra segment began with the performance of \"Memories\", a previously unreleased song by Whitney Houston. Recorded by Whitney in 1982, the unreleased song was given to Siti by Yonder Music. For the concert, it was performed as a \"digital duet\" where Siti sang as a duet with prerecorded Whitney's vocals. She credited Whitney for teaching her about proper vocal techniques before singing few lines from \"I Will Always Love You\" a cappella. She later performed \"Jerat Percintaan\", her first single that was composed by Datuk Adnan Abu Hassan as a tribute to him after he died a few weeks before the concert on 18 March 2016. Next, she performed two of her duet songs with two male singers who have originally recorded the two songs with her respectively. She first sang with Hafiz Suip for \"Muara Hati\" before proceeding with another duet with Cakra Khan for \"Seluruh Cinta\". She then proceeded the show with the performance of \"Menatap dalam Mimpi\" and a medley of \"Seindah Biasa\" and \"Kau Sangat Bererti\". After the medley, she called on stage Faizal Tahir for the duet performance of \"Bagaikan Sakti\". After the duet, she briefly recalled the memories of her late father before tearing up since he was not there \"to witness this momentous moment\" with her. After the brief recollection, she was joined by Afgansyah Reza for the performance of \"Biarlah Rahsia\" before closing the orchestra segment of the concert with solo performance of \"Lebih Indah\". After she exited the stage, she later was accompanied by all her guest artists including Jaclyn Victor to the stage for the encore performance of \"Kau Ilhamku\".\n\nThroughout the concert, for every break and Siti's dress change, prerecorded video interviews with individuals who are closed with Siti were shown on the large screen at the back. Individuals who were interviewed were including her close family members, friends, colleagues, and even her former school teachers. At the end of the concert, music video for \"Memories\" was also shot and recorded for later release.\n\nVocal performances and overall showmanship of Siti and her duet partners were subjects of critics' appraisals. Although this concert marked Siti's first collaboration with Anggun, their duet performances were highly praised. Nadia Azam of \"Malaysiakini\" reviewed that Siti's duet with Anggun was \"the most awaited performance of the night\" and Nor Amirah Mahmuddin of \"Youth Bernama\" called the pair as a \"unique combination\". Izwan Mohd Isa of \"Kosmo!\" commented that their vocals for the two duets of \"Snow on the Sahara\" and \"Bukan Cinta Biasa\" were \"utterly breathtaking\". Bissme S. of \"The Sun\" also shared the same sentiment. He commented, \"Sometimes, when you have a duet with two skilled singers, things can go terribly wrong. They may try to upstage one other. Thankfully, that did not happen here. Anggun and Siti complemented each other perfectly. It was just two good friends having a good time on stage.\" He also favoured Siti's duet with another Indonesian singer, Afgansyah Reza for \"Biarlah Rahsia\". He commented, \"The combination of his raspy voice and her powerful vocals provided a unique and interesting flavour for the evening.\" He also reviewed that Siti's duet with Faizal Tahir for \"Bagaikan Sakti\" was \"memorable\" and he \"managed to put his own personality into the song.\" Siti's duets with Cakra Khan and Hafiz Suip for \"Seluruh Cinta\" and \"Muara Hati\" respectively were reviewed positively by Nor Amirah Mahmuddin of \"Youth Bernama\" who stated that Siti's vocals blended really well with her singing partners.\n\nSiti's \"digital duet\" with Whitney Houston for the debut live performance of \"Memories\" was reviewed favourably by the critics. Siti Athirah Dzulkifly of \"Utusan Malaysia\" called the duet as \"unique\", Bissme S. of \"The Sun\" reviewed it as \"one of the highlights of the night\", and Jemang Rahman of \"mStar\" praised it as \"Siti continues to spellbind thousands of her audience with her impressive vocals\" and \"will be remembered by the audience\". Bissme S. of \"The Sun\", however, reviewed negatively the opening act of the dancing young girl. He criticized the routine as \"tame, lame and dull\" and \"I think the concept didn’t work out as intended. Instead of enchanting everyone, this act made the crowd restless. We couldn’t wait for the dancing to stop and the music to begin.\" He later added that Siti \"saved the day\" when she appeared on the stage and \"from that point on, the concert was a roller coaster ride of pure entertainment.\"\n\nOverall, \"Dato Siti Nurhaliza & Friends Concert\" received positive reviews and feedback from critics and concert reviewers. Haslina Kamaludin of \"Sinar Harian\" in her review stated, \"IMPRESSIVE! That is what [one] can say after watching the \"Dato Siti Nurhaliza & Friends Concert\". Overall, this concert deserves to be given five stars. From the aspect of its lighting, musicians, music arrangements, and her vocals, there are nothing left to be argued.\" A number of reviewers also echoed Haslina's review that the event is a 5-star concert. Izwan Mohd Isa of \"Kosmo!\" in his review stated, \"[...] In the 20 years that she has steered her career as a vocalist, this 37 years old woman has also never failed in placing herself among the best, until the point she was able to receive the \"seal of approval\" as the nation's number one singer by the public.\" He concluded his review with:\nFrom the music arrangements, sound [system], stage organization and lighting techniques, Yonder Music has successfully created a fresh environment to visualize Siti's 20 years in the industry. This concert henceforth has become a benchmark for Siti as a credible entertainer who deserves to fly high in the music stratosphere for more than 20 years. May she live long with her career [continues] to 'mature' and [becomes more] profound.\nFor fans who could not attend the show, the concert was made available for streaming on ESCAPE by Celcom during the night of the concert. Few days after the event, a live album for the concert was made available for streaming on the Yonder Music mobile app for its subscribers.\n\nThe live concert also aired on Astro Ria (Channel 104/123) on December 11, 2016 at 9pm.\n\n\nSource: Adapted from concert's press release.\n\nThe free concert was officially announced on 2 March 2016. Since the tickets are not for sale, fans have to be subscribers and users of Celcom mobile communication service and Yonder Music mobile app respectively to stand a chance to win a pair of tickets per individual. Originally available to 6000 people, the seating arrangement for the concert was revised so that the stadium can fit an additional 1000 people. Adam Kidron, the CEO of Yonder Music commented on the addition as, \"We felt the responsibility to answer the call of thousands of music fans that wanted their spot at the concert and worked tirelessly with stage and production crews on an adaptation of the event design in order to accommodate more fans\". Until 22 March 2016, it was revealed that more than 6300 tickets have been redeemed.\n\nOn the night of the concert, it was reported more than 7000 people actually attended the event.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1503012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1503012", "title": "Free tekno (music)", "text": "Free tekno (music)\n\nFree tekno, also known as freetekno and hardtek, is the name given to the music predominantly played at free parties in Europe. The spelling of the word tekno is made to deliberately differentiate the musical style from that of techno. The music is fast, normally 170 to 200 bpm and characterised by a pounding repetitive kick drum. Nevertheless, bass drum distortion by clipping is used less often as in the related genre of mainstyle hardcore. Nowadays, some tekno producers also use drum sets that rather sound trancey, since many members of the tekno subculture as well as the psytrance subculture frequently attend the same raves and the two scenes are closely connected. \n\nTekno evolved in tandem with the teknival movement in the early 1990s since many of the teknival organisers and DJs were also making music. The music drew on influences such as hardcore, rave, jungle, early hardcore and techno, with the producers taking the sound in a darker direction. Spiral tribe were the first to start making and widely disseminating this genre taking it to France and Eastern Europe after the Criminal Justice act was implemented in the UK. An emphasis is placed on samples from TV shows, films and popular culture which are placed at strategic moments in the tracks. The music was produced with whatever was available: drum machines, synthesisers and keyboards as well as computer programs such as audio/MIDI sequencers and Trackers, sometimes even hitting a random table with a pen. Starting from year 2001 there has been a trend using laptop and laptops for live performances, because the capabilities of both the hardware and software were improving very quick.\n\nWith the evolution of the genre it has come to be known by a number of names, including spiral tekno, hardtek, tribetek, tribe and lately evolved in many other subgenres like pumping tek, hardfloor and French core which is a sort of mixture between mainstream Hardcore and Hardtekno, with funny and pumping samples taken from different media supports.\n\nTekno producers come from numerous places, particularly in Europe, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. Some of the most active artist who from the early 90's up till the mid 2000s were Spiral Tribe, Crystal Distortion, Lego, Liqitex, 69db, Ixy, Kaos, Jack Acid, Curley, Unit Moebius, Les Boucles Etranges, Yale, FKY, Babyon Joke, Arobass, Gotek, Floxytek, Suburbass, Zone-33, Mat Weasel Buster, Narkotek, Kernel Panik, Revolt99, Infrabass, Vinka, Banditos, Diablo (LSDF), Teknambul, Spiralheadz, Asphalt-Pirates, Aya Soundsystem, Puissance K, Guigoo, Billx, Maissouille, Key Gen, Psychospores, Fractal, Sceletor, and Lyzor-sak.\n\nMany record labels contributed spreading the sound mostly via underground distribution operated mostly by record shops / labels such as Hokus Pokus (Paris) and Toolbox Records (Paris), and record labels such as Tek No Logique (TNL), Narkotek and Astrofonik.\nHere a list of some of the most active record labels\nNetwork 23 record label Spiral Tribe sound system, Hokus Pokus, Passe Muraille, Perce Oreille, Infrabass, KGB Records, OQP Crue Production, dSP records, Tek No Logique, Narkotek, Astrofonik, Le Diable Au Corps.\n\nArtists within this genre usually follow a very different ideology when compared to more modern and mainstream producers:\nThis is described as \"returning to the roots\".\n\nJungletek and Raggatek is a subgenres derived directly from Hardtek. These well known genres collide to create fast energetic 190 BPM dance floor smashers. Kicked of around 2008 here in the UK Mandidextrous & Vandal were among the first producers to start writing this genre of music. It breathed new life into the underground rave scene not only here in the UK but also picking up a strong following in Italy, Spain and Austria to mention a few. Massive influence for this music also came from the Techno scene in Europe where some of the first underground music lovers started to up the bpm and add variations in structure thus becoming Tekno. Techno in the UK in the early 90’s was based on a bpm of 130-140. By the 00’s music on its never ending journey of progression had gained more speed and Hardtek was starting to dominate UK raves especially in the South and London.. Even Trance had progressed from sweeping delicate melody’s to whats now known as Hardtrance a faster, harder more bouncy music to its predecessor. Music all over the underground was getting harder and faster. In today’s world the most recent and noticeable evaluation in music is the progression of DnB into Neuro Funk, very similar to DnB but with grittier and harsher bass and synth sounds often using masses of compression to get those tearing bass line which is now worlds apart from one of the original DnB genres pioneered by Carl Cox Jungletechno.\n\nRaggatek is predominantly influenced by Reggae and Ragga music, incorporating Jungle, DnB, Dancehall, Reggae, Ragga and Techno music. Well known MC’s such as YT and Top Cat are a massive influence on the world of Raggatek. Producers loving this type of sound wanted to bring it to the dance floors of the underground. Upping the bpm to between 180 – 200 adding amen breaks and the basic structure of Hardtek that kick bass kick bass format was the formula for a new hybrid music. The big sounding Ragga style vocals are often a massive presence on Raggatek productions.\n\nJungletek works on exactly the same formula as Raggatek just replace the Ragga with Jungle & DnB. Being less known for the vocal arrangements and more about the bass lines. Jungletek takes the basics of the bass line from well known Jungle and DnB tracks and recreates them in a Hardtek format. Original productions also use the simple format of kick bass with amen breaks. European Raggatek and Jungletek is often recognisable by the high energy eletro sounds in the bass lines and synth melody’s.\n\n\n"}

According to tales, the trout has created a thick coat of fur to maintain its body heat. Tales of furry fish date to the 17th-century and later the \"shaggy trout\" of Iceland. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 \"Montana Wildlife\" magazine article by J.H. Hicken. A taxidermy furry trout produced by Ross C. Jobe is a specimen at the Royal Museum of Scotland; it is a trout with white rabbit fur \"ingeniously\" attached.\n\nThere are no real examples of any fur-bearing trout species, but two examples of hair-like growths on fish are known. The \"cotton mold\", \"Saprolegnia\", can infect fish, which can result in the appearance of fish covered in the white \"fur\". A real fish, \"Mirapinna esau\", also known as the \"Hairy Fish\", has hair-like outgrowths and wings.\n\nFur-bearing trout are fictional creatures that are purportedly found in Arkansas, northern North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) is that the waters of lakes and rivers in the area are so cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory says that it is due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.\n\nThe origins vary, but one of the earlier claims date to a 17th-century Scottish immigrant's letter to his relatives referring to \"furried animals and fish\" being plentiful in the New World. It was followed by a request to procure a specimen of these \"furried fish\" and one was sent home. A publication in 1900 recounts the Icelandic Lodsilungur, another haired trout, as being a common folklore. The earliest known American publication dates from a 1929 \"Montana Wildlife\" magazine article by J.H. Hicken.\n\nThe \"cotton mold\" \"Saprolegnia\" will sometimes infect fish, causing tufts of fur-like growth to appear on the body. A heavy infection will result in the death of the fish, and as the fungus continues to grow afterwards, dead fish that are largely covered in the white \"fur\" can occasionally be found washed ashore. A real fish, \"Mirapinna esau\" known as the \"Hairy Fish\", has hair-like outgrowths and wings. It was discovered in the Azores in 1956.\n\nAccording to Icelandic legend, the Lodsilungur (\"\") is a furry trout that is the creation of demons and giants. The Lodsilungur are described as inedible fish that overwhelm rivers and are a form of punishment for human wickedness. In 1900, \"The Scottish Review\" featured an account of the Lodsilungur as a poisonous \"Shaggy trout\" of northern Iceland. In 1854, a shaggy trout was \"cast on shore at Svina-vatn\" and featured in an 1855 illustration in \"Nordri\", a newspaper. It was described as having a reddish hair on its lower jaw and neck, sides and fins, but the writer of the \"Nordri\" article did not specifically identify it by name. Sjón, a popular Icelandic writer, became obsessed with the folk tale when he was nine. Sjón recounted that if a man were to eat the furry trout he would become pregnant and that his scrotum would have to be cut open to deliver the baby. Sjón noted that the story \"might explain why I was later propelled towards surrealism.\"\n\nAn account of a furry trout appeared in 1929 in \"Montana Wildlife\" magazine and was first noted by J.H. Hicken. Hicken's account states that when the fish is caught \"the change of temperature from this water to atmosphere is so great that the fish explodes upon being taken from the water, and fur and skin come off in one perfect piece, making it available for commercial purposes, and leaving the body of the fish for refrigerator purposes or eating, as desired.\"\n\nMy Ten Years in a Quandary, and How They Grew, A 1936 bestselling book by Robert Benchley, contains the humorous essay \"Bad News\" about a report of fur-bearing trout used as a goiter cure \n\nAnother fur-bearing trout story originated with Wilbur Foshay, secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. Foshay promoted the story so convincingly that it was picked up by the \"Salida Record\" newspaper. According to its Foshay, the trout grew fur due to the cold temperatures of the Arkansas River and shed the fur as the water temperatures warmed in the summer. In November 1938, a story in the \"Puebloan Cheiftan\" recounted the hairy trout history and stated that \"[o]ld-timers living along the Arkansas River near Salida have told tales for many years of the fur-bearing trout indigenous to the waters of the Arkansas near there.\" In 2014, \"Mysteries at the Museum\" visited the Salida Museum and is expected to be part of a segment in late 2014.\n\nA tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, it states that hairy trout were the result of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch hairy trout, fisherman would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed hairy trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the pelt made into furry slippers.\n\nThe Canadian fur-bearing trout is another example of the furry trout hoax. According to the story, a trout with white fur was caught in Lake Superior off Gros Cap in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Algoma District, Canada, and its taxidermist was Ross C. Jobe of Sault Ste. Marie. The purchaser of the fish learned of the hoax after presenting it to the Royal Museum of Scotland. The white fur of a rabbit was described as being \"ingeniously\" attached to the fish. A fictional description of the Canadian \"Hairy\" Trout was published by Takeshi Yamada.\n\n\n"}

Starting out as a biennial festival, KIMFF turned annual and competitive in 2007. KIMFF typically takes places around 11 December to coincide with the International Mountain Day.\n\nKIMFF uses cinemas, other visual art forms, workshops and discussion forums to inform and educate as wide and as large a variety of audience on particular issues within the duration of the festival. After the completion of festival in Kathmandu, a special package of films is taken to various locations within Nepal as a part of \"Travelling KIMFF\".\nExtreme sports, adventure, religion, or distinct cultural practices, human beings relate with mountains in a myriad of ways. In a world whose character and landscapes are rapidly changing, our relationship with mountains is only getting broader, subtler, and more intricate. The growing diversity and complexity of this relationship is what Kathmandu International Mountain Film Festival (KIMFF) seeks to explore.\n\nKIMFF, the only festival of its kind east of Suez, brings to Kathmandu Valley some of the most recent and exciting films about mountains, mountain environment, mountain cultures and communities from various corners of the world. KIMFF screens films produced during the last three years and features discussion forums, on-demand screenings, as well as exhibitions of books and photography celebrating mountains. The festival is organized with the conviction that human experiences in the world’s highlands, especially those in the developing countries, is worth documenting and sharing. KIMFF hopes not only to encourage a deeper understanding of the social and cultural realities of those regions but also to create a sense that the significance of those regions is often far-flung.\nOrganized by Himal Association, KIMFF started as a non-competitive, biennial festival in 2000. A wide selection of films – alpine documentation, archival footage, adventure cinema, experimental shorts, commentaries, anthropological narratives, feature films, etc. – have been screened in the previous four festivals. These movies have dealt with issues regarding cultural practices, lifestyles, conflict, wildlife, mountain-climbing, environment, globalization, and gender, among many others.\n\nOver the years, the festival has attracted not only filmmakers, film enthusiasts, and critics, but also scholars, journalists, activists, and mountaineers. It is the interest of this creative and intellectual community that has sustained KIMFF and placed Kathmandu Valley on the map of international film festivals. The impetus for the festival has always been the trust of this community in the capability of the audio-visual medium in creating social and economic transformations.\n\nKIMFF is also one of the member of International Alliance for Mountain Film (IAMF) among others like Banff Mountain Film Festival, Trento Film Festival, Autrans and others.\n\n\n"}

Founded in 2015, the traveling festival is held annually (usually in September) at various venues in the Southwestern United States. It is based in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival originated in September 2016 at Beyond Baroque Literary Arts Center in Venice, CA. It was founded the previous year, after filmmaker Edda Manriquez attended a Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media seminar at CalArts. In 2017, the festival was held at Digital Gym Cinema in San Diego, CA, and in 2018, it is set to be held at Phoenix Center for the Arts in Phoenix, AZ. Manriquez and her partner created the festival with the intent of bringing feminist diversity to media, breaking gender-based stereotypes, and empowering young female filmmakers to generate such work. They also sought to bridge cultural and socioeconomic restrictions and became a traveling film festival with the intent of alleviating traveling costs for emerging feminist filmmakers while giving them a platform and celebrating their accomplishments. The Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival is a registered non-profit 501(c)(3) organization.\n\nThe festival specializes in fourth-wave feminist film sub-genres, including documentary, experimental, narrative, horror, animation, and VR. They focus on \"subversive, unique, and innovative\" topics such as female sexuality, esotericism, witchcraft, and occult ideology in support of gender equality, women's independence, and women's empowerment. Manriquez is cited as calling the festival \"a cinematic adventure that destroys the meaning of mundane through its unique programming via the underground world of feminist intersectional art, music, and celluloid fantasies.\"\n\nThe festival also provides outreach events, including Books for Babes, a literacy initiative which aims to bring feminist children's books to underrepresented communities, including teenage mothers, women's shelters, low-income areas, and single parent households, in the United States. They also provide traveling workshops in health and wellness, women's empowerment, career resources, and financial assistance to women and female-identifying artists who are attempting to acquire film distribution and further their careers. They focus specifically on the Boyle Heights and San Fernando Valley areas in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nThe Les Femmes Underground International Film Festival hosts regular panels and events, including a screening of the documentary \"Fattitude\" at Echo Park Film Center, which explored the topic \"Deconstructing the Female Body in Media\" during Women's History Month in 2018.

{"id": "1239169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1239169", "title": "Numantia", "text": "Numantia\n\nNumantia (Numancia in Spanish) was an ancient Celtiberian settlement, whose remains are located 7 km north of the city of Soria, on a hill known as Cerro de la Muela in the municipality of Garray.\n\nNumantia is famous for its role in the Celtiberian Wars.\nIn the year 153 BC Numantia experienced its first serious conflict with Rome.\nAfter 20 years of hostilities, in the year 133 BC the Roman Senate gave Scipio Aemilianus Africanus\nthe task of destroying Numantia. He laid siege to the city, erecting a nine kilometre fence supported by towers, moats, impaling rods and so on. After 13 months of siege, the Numantians decided to burn the city before surrendering.\n\nThe nearest settlement to the ruins of Numantia is the village of Garray in the province of Soria. Garray has grown up next to a bridge across the Duero. It is only a few miles from the small city of Soria, capital of the eponymous province.\n\nNumantia was an Iron Age hill fort (in Roman terminology an \"oppidum\"), which controlled a crossing of the river Duero. \nPliny the Elder counts it as a city of the Pellendones, but other authors, like Strabo and Ptolemy place it among the Arevaci people. The Arevaci were a Celtiberian tribe, formed by the mingling of Iberians and migrating Celts in the 6th century BC, who inhabited an area near Numantia and Uxama.\n\nThe first serious conflict with Rome occurred in 153 BC when Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was consul. Numantia took in some fugitives from the city of Segeda, who belonged to another Celtiberian tribe called the Belli. The leader of the Belli, Carus of Segeda, managed to defeat a Roman army. The Romans then besieged Numantia, and deployed a small number of war elephants, but were unsuccessful. \n\nBefore their defeat in 133 BC, the Numantians gained a number of victories. For example, in 137 BC, 20,000 Romans surrendered to the Celtiberians of Numantia (population between 4,000-8,000). The young Roman officer Tiberius Gracchus, as quaestor, saved the Roman army from destruction by signing a peace treaty with the Numantines, an action generally reserved for a Legate.\n\nThe final siege of Numantia began in the year 134 BC. Scipio Aemilianus, who was a Roman consul at that time, was in command of an army of 30,000 soldiers. His troops constructed a number of fortifications surrounding the city as they prepared for a long siege. Resistance was hopeless but the Numantians refused to surrender and famine quickly spread through the city. After eight months most of the inhabitants decided to commit suicide rather than become slaves. Only a few hundred of the inhabitants, exhausted and famished, surrendered to the victorious Roman legions.\nThe Spanish expression \"Defensa numantina\" may be used to indicate any desperate, suicidal last ditch stand against invading forces.\n\nAfter the destruction, there are remains of occupation in the 1st century BC, with a regular street plan but without great public buildings.\n\nIts decay starts in the 3rd century, but with Roman remains still from the 4th century.\nLater remains from the 6th century hint of a Visigoth occupation.\n\nNumantia's exact location vanished from memory, and some theories placed it in Zamora, but in 1860 Eduardo Saavedra identified the correct location in Garray, Soria. In 1882 the ruins of Numantia were declared a national monument.\nIn 1905 the German archaeologist Adolf Schulten began a series of excavations which located the Roman camps around the city. In 1999 the Roman camps were included in a \"zona arqueológica\", a category of the Spanish heritage register which did not exist when the hillfort was first protected.\nRegular excavations are still going on.\n\nMany objects from the site are on display in the Numantine Museum of Soria (Spanish: \"Museo Numantino\"). This museum is also responsible for \"in situ\" displays at Numantia.\n\nOther collections which have items from the site include the Romano-Germanic Central Museum, Mainz.\n(Some objects were taken by Adolf Schulten to Germany).\n\nThe province of Soria is sparsely populated, and Numantia is mainly surrounded by land used for low intensity agriculture. However, the regional government of Castilla y Leon and the city of Soria have planned various construction projects which if completed would affect the landscape surrounding the site of Numantia.\n\nThe proposed developments in the vicinity of Numantia have met widespread opposition from a number of quarters, including the Instituto de España, the Real Academia de la Historia, the Catalan Institute of Classical Archaeology, the Spanish Section of the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) and a number of Ancient History Departments in Spain. In 2008 a petition organised to have Numantia declared a World Heritage Site, in the hope that this would deter the local authorities from developing the area.\n\nIn 2010 work began on a \"City of the Environment\" on an ecologically important site near the river Duero.\n\nThe most damaging proposal from a visual point of view is the plan to develop a new industrial zone (\"Polígono Industrial de Soria II\"). This industrial estate has been planned for El Cabezo, which is adjacent to Numantia and the Roman encampment (and would also affect part of the Romanesque site of Los Arcos de San Juan de Duero). There has been a legal appeal by the aristocratic Marichalar family against the expropriation of its land for this development.\n\nThe siege of Numantia was recorded by several Roman historians who admired the sense of freedom of the ancient Iberians and acknowledged their fighting skills against the Roman legions.\nIn Spanish culture, it has a meaning similar to that of Masada for Israelis.\nMiguel de Cervantes (author of \"Don Quijote\") wrote a play about the siege, \"El cerco de Numancia\", which stands today as his best-known dramatic work.\nAntonio Machado references the city in his poetry book \"Campos de Castilla\". The poem is an ode to the countryside and peoples of rural Castile.\nMore recently, Carlos Fuentes wrote a short story about the event, \"The Two Numantias\", in his collection \"The Orange Tree\".\n\nSeveral Spanish Navy ships have been named Numancia and a Sorian battalion was named \"batallón de numantinos\". During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalist Numancia regiment took the town of Azaña in Toledo.\nTo erase the memory of the Republican president Manuel Azaña, they renamed it Numancia de la Sagra.\n\nThe Sorian football team is called CD Numancia.\n\nThe expression \"numantine resistance\" is occasionally used to refer to particularly obdurate resistance.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21875", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21875", "title": "Nuremberg trials", "text": "Nuremberg trials\n\nThe Nuremberg trials () were a series of military tribunals held by the Allied forces under international law and the laws of war after World War II. The trials were most notable for the prosecution of prominent members of the political, military, judicial and economic leadership of Nazi Germany, who planned, carried out, or otherwise participated in the Holocaust and other war crimes. The trials were held in the city of Nuremberg, Germany, and their decisions marked a turning point between classical and contemporary international law.\n\nThe first and best known of these trials was that of the major war criminals before the International Military Tribunal (IMT). It was described as \"the greatest trial in history\" by Norman Birkett, one of the British judges who presided over them. Held between 20 November 1945 and 1 October 1946, the Tribunal was given the task of trying 24 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich – though the proceeding against Martin Bormann was tried \"in absentia\", while another defendant, Robert Ley, committed suicide within a week of the trial's commencement.\n\nAdolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Wilhelm Burgdorf, Hans Krebs and Joseph Goebbels had all committed suicide in the spring of 1945 to avoid capture, though Himmler was captured before his suicide. Krebs and Burgdorf committed suicide two days after Hitler in the same place. Reinhard Heydrich had been assassinated by Czech partisans in 1942. Josef Terboven killed himself with dynamite in Norway in 1945. Adolf Eichmann fled to Argentina to avoid Allied capture, but was apprehended by Israel's intelligence service (Mossad) and hanged in 1962. Hermann Göring was sentenced to death, but committed suicide by consuming cyanide the night before his execution in defiance of his captors. Miklós Horthy appeared as a witness at the Ministries trial held in Nuremberg in 1948.\n\nThis article primarily deals with the first trial, which was conducted by the IMT. Further trials of lesser war criminals were conducted under Control Council Law No. 10 at the U.S. Nuremberg Military Tribunal (NMT), which included the Doctors' trial and the Judges' Trial.\n\nThe categorization of the crimes and the constitution of the court represented a juridical advance that would be used afterwards by the United Nations for the development of a specific international jurisprudence in matters of war crime, crimes against humanity, war of aggression, as well as for the creation of the International Criminal Court.\nThe Nuremberg indictment also mentions genocide for the first time in international law (Count three, war crimes : \"the extermination of racial and national groups, against the civilian populations of certain occupied territories in order to destroy particular races and classes of people and national, racial, or religious groups, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies and others.\")\n\nA precedent for trying those accused of war crimes had been set at the end of World War I in the Leipzig War Crimes Trials held in May to July 1921 before the \"Reichsgericht\" (German Supreme Court) in Leipzig, although these had been on a very limited scale and largely regarded as ineffectual. At the beginning of 1940, the Polish government-in-exile asked the British and French governments to condemn the German invasion of their country. The British initially declined to do so; however, in April 1940, a joint declaration was issued by the British, French and Polish. Relatively bland because of Anglo-French reservations, it proclaimed the trio's \"desire to make a formal and public protest to the conscience of the world against the action of the German government whom they must hold responsible for these crimes which cannot remain unpunished.\"\n\nThree-and-a-half years later, the stated intention to punish the Germans was much more trenchant. On 1 November 1943, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States published their \"Declaration on German Atrocities in Occupied Europe\", which gave a \"full warning\" that, when the Nazis were defeated, the Allies would \"pursue them to the uttermost ends of the earth ... in order that justice may be done. ... The above declaration is without prejudice to the case of the major war criminals whose offences have no particular geographical location and who will be punished by a joint decision of the Government of the Allies.\" This intention by the Allies to dispense justice was reiterated at the Yalta Conference and at Potsdam in 1945.\n\nBritish War Cabinet documents, released on 2 January 2006, showed that as early as December 1944 the Cabinet had discussed their policy for the punishment of the leading Nazis if captured. The British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, had then advocated a policy of summary execution in some circumstances, with the use of an Act of Attainder to circumvent legal obstacles, being dissuaded from this only by talks with US and Soviet leaders later in the war.\nIn late 1943, during the Tripartite Dinner Meeting at the Tehran Conference, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, proposed executing 50,000–100,000 German staff officers. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt joked that perhaps 49,000 would do. Churchill, believing them to be serious, denounced the idea of \"the cold blooded execution of soldiers who fought for their country\" and that he would rather be \"taken out in the courtyard and shot\" himself than partake in any such action. However, he also stated that war criminals must pay for their crimes and that, in accordance with the Moscow Document which he himself had written, they should be tried at the places where the crimes were committed. Churchill was vigorously opposed to executions \"for political purposes.\" According to the minutes of a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin at Yalta, on 4 February 1945, at the Livadia Palace, President Roosevelt \"said that he had been very much struck by the extent of German destruction in Crimea and therefore he was more bloodthirsty in regard to the Germans than he had been a year ago, and he hoped that Marshal Stalin would again propose a toast to the execution of 50,000 officers of the German Army.\"\n\nHenry Morgenthau Jr., US Secretary of the Treasury, suggested a plan for the total denazification of Germany; this was known as the Morgenthau Plan. The plan advocated the forced de-industrialisation of Germany and the summary execution of so-called \"arch-criminals\", i.e. the major war criminals. Roosevelt initially supported this plan, and managed to convince Churchill to support it in a less drastic form. Later, details were leaked generating widespread condemnation by the nation's newspapers. Roosevelt, aware of strong public disapproval, abandoned the plan, but did not adopt an alternative position on the matter. The demise of the Morgenthau Plan created the need for an alternative method of dealing with the Nazi leadership. The plan for the \"Trial of European War Criminals\" was drafted by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson and the War Department. Following Roosevelt's death in April 1945, the new president, Harry S. Truman, gave strong approval for a judicial process. After a series of negotiations between Britain, the US, Soviet Union and France, details of the trial were worked out. The trials were to commence on 20 November 1945, in the Bavarian city of Nuremberg.\n\nOn 20 April 1942, representatives from the nine countries occupied by Germany met in London to draft the \"Inter-Allied Resolution on German War Crimes\". At the meetings in Tehran (1943), Yalta (1945) and Potsdam (1945), the three major wartime powers, the United Kingdom, United States, and the Soviet Union, agreed on the format of punishment for those responsible for war crimes during World War II. France was also awarded a place on the tribunal. The legal basis for the trial was established by the London Charter, which was agreed upon by the four so-called Great Powers on 8 August 1945, and which restricted the trial to \"punishment of the major war criminals of the European Axis countries\"\n\nSome 200 German war crimes defendants were tried at Nuremberg, and 1,600 others were tried under the traditional channels of military justice. The legal basis for the jurisdiction of the court was that defined by the Instrument of Surrender of Germany. Political authority for Germany had been transferred to the Allied Control Council which, having sovereign power over Germany, could choose to punish violations of international law and the laws of war. Because the court was limited to violations of the laws of war, it did not have jurisdiction over crimes that took place before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939.\n\nLeipzig and Luxembourg were briefly considered as the location for the trial. The Soviet Union had wanted the trials to take place in Berlin, as the capital city of the 'fascist conspirators', but Nuremberg was chosen as the site for two reasons, with the first one having been the decisive factor:\n\nAs a compromise with the Soviets, it was agreed that while the location of the trial would be Nuremberg, Berlin would be the official home of the Tribunal authorities.<ref name=\"PRO-LCO-2/2980-1\"></ref><ref name=\"PRO-LCO-2/2980-2\"></ref> It was also agreed that France would become the permanent seat of the IMT and that the first trial (several were planned) would take place in Nuremberg.\n\nMost of the accused had previously been detained at Camp Ashcan, a processing station and interrogation center in Luxembourg, and were moved to Nuremberg for the trial.\n\nEach of the four countries provided one judge and an alternative, as well as a prosecutor.\n\n\nAssisting Jackson were the lawyers Telford Taylor, William S. Kaplan and Thomas J. Dodd, and Richard Sonnenfeldt, a US Army interpreter. Assisting Shawcross were Major Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe and Sir John Wheeler-Bennett. Mervyn Griffith-Jones, who was later to become famous as the chief prosecutor in the \"Lady Chatterley's Lover\" obscenity trial, was also on Shawcross's team. Shawcross also recruited a young barrister, Anthony Marreco, who was the son of a friend of his, to help the British team with the heavy workload.\n\nThe vast majority of the defense attorneys were German lawyers. These included Georg Fröschmann, Heinz Fritz (Hans Fritzsche), Otto Kranzbühler (Karl Dönitz), Otto Pannenbecker (Wilhelm Frick), Alfred Thoma (Alfred Rosenberg), Kurt Kauffmann (Ernst Kaltenbrunner), Hans Laternser (general staff and high command), Franz Exner (Alfred Jodl), Alfred Seidl (Hans Frank), Otto Stahmer (Hermann Göring), Walter Ballas (Gustav Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach), Hans Flächsner (Albert Speer), Günther von Rohrscheidt (Rudolf Hess), Egon Kubuschok (Franz von Papen), Robert Servatius (Fritz Sauckel), Fritz Sauter (Joachim von Ribbentrop), Walther Funk (Baldur von Schirach), Hanns Marx (Julius Streicher), Otto Nelte (Wilhelm Keitel), and Herbert Kraus/Rudolph Dix (both working for Hjalmar Schacht). The main counsels were supported by a total of 70 assistants, clerks and lawyers. The defense counsel witnesses included several men who took part in the war crimes during World War II, such as Rudolf Höss. The men testifying for the defense hoped to receive more lenient sentences. All of the men testifying on behalf of the defense were found guilty on several counts.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal was opened on 19 November 1945 in the Palace of Justice in Nuremberg. The first session was presided over by the Soviet judge, Nikitchenko. The prosecution entered indictments against 24 major war criminals and seven organizations – the leadership of the Nazi party, the Reich Cabinet, the Schutzstaffel (SS), Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the Gestapo, the Sturmabteilung (SA) and the \"General Staff and High Command\", comprising several categories of senior military officers. These organizations were to be declared \"criminal\" if found guilty.\n\nThe indictments were for:\nThe 24 accused were, with respect to each charge, either indicted but not convicted (I), indicted and found guilty (G), or not charged (—), as listed below by defendant, charge, and eventual outcome:\n\nThe Rorschach test was administered to the defendants, along with the Thematic Apperception Test and a German adaptation of the Wechsler-Bellevue Intelligence Test. All were above average intelligence, several considerably so.\n\nThroughout the trials, specifically between January and July 1946, the defendants and a number of witnesses were interviewed by American psychiatrist Leon Goldensohn. His notes detailing the demeanor and comments of the defendants survive; they were edited into book form and published in 2004. Jean Delay was the psychiatric expert for the French delegation in the trial of Rudolf Heß.\n\n\nThe accusers were successful in unveiling the background of developments leading to the outbreak of World War II, which cost at least 40 million lives in Europe alone, as well as the extent of the atrocities committed in the name of the Hitler regime. Twelve of the accused were sentenced to death, seven received prison sentences (ranging from 10 years to life in prison), three were acquitted, and two were not charged.\n\nThe death sentences were carried out on 16 October 1946 by hanging using the standard drop method instead of long drop. The U.S. Army denied claims that the drop length was too short which caused the condemned to die slowly from strangulation instead of quickly from a broken neck, but evidence remains that some of the condemned men died agonizingly slowly, struggling for 14 to 28 minutes before finally choking to death. The executioner was John C. Woods. Woods had hanged 34 U.S. soldiers during the war, botching several of them. The executions took place in the gymnasium of the court building (demolished in 1983).\n\nAlthough the rumor has long persisted that the bodies were taken to Dachau and burned there, they were actually incinerated in a crematorium in Munich, and the ashes scattered over the river Isar. The French judges suggested that the military condemned (Göring, Keitel and Jodl) be shot by a firing squad, as is standard for military courts-martial, but this was opposed by Biddle and the Soviet judges, who argued that the military officers had violated their military ethos and were not worthy of death by being shot, which was considered to be more dignified. The prisoners sentenced to incarceration were transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947.\n\nOf the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, two were not hanged: Martin Bormann was convicted in absentia (he had, unknown to the Allies, died while trying to escape from Berlin in May 1945), and Hermann Göring committed suicide the night before the execution. The remaining 10 defendants sentenced to death were hanged.\n\nThe definition of what constitutes a war crime is described by the Nuremberg principles, a set of guidelines document which was created as a result of the trial. The medical experiments conducted by German doctors and prosecuted in the so-called Doctors' Trial led to the creation of the Nuremberg Code to control future trials involving human subjects, a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation.\n\nOf the indicted organizations the following were found not to be criminal:\n\nThe American authorities conducted subsequent Nuremberg Trials in their occupied zone.\n\nOther trials conducted after the first Nuremberg trial include the following:\n\nWhile Sir Geoffrey Lawrence of Britain was the judge chosen as president of the court, the most prominent of the judges at trial arguably was his American counterpart, Francis Biddle. Prior to the trial, Biddle had been Attorney General of the United States but had been asked to resign by Truman earlier in 1945.\n\nSome accounts argue that Truman had appointed Biddle as the main American judge for the trial as an apology for asking for his resignation. Ironically, Biddle was known during his time as Attorney General for opposing the idea of prosecuting Nazi leaders for crimes committed before the beginning of the war, even sending out a memorandum on 5 January 1945 on the subject. The note also expressed Biddle's opinion that instead of proceeding with the original plan for prosecuting entire organizations, there should simply be more trials that would prosecute specific offenders.\n\nBiddle soon changed his mind, as he approved a modified version of the plan on 21 January 1945, likely due to time constraints, since the trial would be one of the main issues discussed at Yalta. At trial, the Nuremberg tribunal ruled that any member of an organization convicted of war crimes, such as the SS or Gestapo, who had joined after 1939 would be considered a war criminal. Biddle managed to convince the other judges to make an exemption for any member who was drafted or had no knowledge of the crimes being committed by these organizations.\n\nJustice Robert H. Jackson played an important role in not only the trial itself, but also in the creation of the International Military Tribunal, as he led the American delegation to London that, in the summer of 1945, argued in favour of prosecuting the Nazi leadership as a criminal conspiracy. According to Airey Neave, Jackson was also the one behind the prosecution's decision to include membership in any of the six criminal organizations in the indictments at the trial, though the IMT rejected this on the grounds that it was wholly without precedent in either international law or the domestic laws of any of the Allies. Jackson also attempted to have Alfried Krupp be tried in place of his father, Gustav, and even suggested that Alfried volunteer to be tried in his father's place. Both proposals were rejected by the IMT, particularly by Lawrence and Biddle, and some sources indicate that this resulted in Jackson being viewed unfavourably by the latter.\n\nThomas Dodd was a prosecutor for the United States. There was an immense amount of evidence backing the prosecutors' case, especially since meticulous records of the Nazis' actions had been kept. There were records taken in by the prosecutors that had signatures from specific Nazis signing for everything from stationery supplies to Zyklon B gas, which was used to kill the inmates of the deathcamps. Thomas Dodd showed a series of pictures to the courtroom after reading through the documents of crimes committed by the defendants. The showing consisted of pictures displaying the atrocities performed by the defendants. The pictures had been gathered when the inmates were liberated from the concentration camps.\n\nHenry Gerecke, a Lutheran pastor, was sent to minister to the Nazi defendants.\n\nThe Tribunal is celebrated for establishing that \"[c]rimes against international law are committed by men, not by abstract entities, and only by punishing individuals who commit such crimes can the provisions of international law be enforced.\" The creation of the IMT was followed by trials of lesser Nazi officials and the trials of Nazi doctors, who performed experiments on people in prison camps. It served as the model for the International Military Tribunal for the Far East which tried Japanese officials for crimes against peace and against humanity. It also served as the model for the Eichmann trial and for present-day courts at The Hague, for trying crimes committed during the Balkan wars of the early 1990s, and at Arusha, for trying the people responsible for the genocide in Rwanda.\n\nThe Nuremberg trials had a great influence on the development of international criminal law. The Conclusions of the Nuremberg trials served as models for:\n\nThe International Law Commission, acting on the request of the United Nations General Assembly, produced in 1950 the report \"Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nürnberg Tribunal and in the Judgement of the Tribunal\" (Yearbook of the International Law Commission, 1950, vol. II). See Nuremberg Principles.\n\nThe influence of the tribunal can also be seen in the proposals for a permanent international criminal court, and the drafting of international criminal codes, later prepared by the International Law Commission.\n\nTourists can visit courtroom 600 on days when no trial is on. A permanent exhibition has been dedicated to the trials.\n\nThe Nuremberg trials initiated a movement for the prompt establishment of a permanent international criminal court, eventually leading over fifty years later to the adoption of the Statute of the International Criminal Court. This movement was brought about because during the trials, there were conflicting court methods between the German court system and the U.S. court system. The crime of conspiracy was unheard of in the civil law systems of the Continent. Therefore, the German defense found it unfair to charge the defendants with conspiracy to commit crimes, while the judges from common-law countries were used to doing so.\n\nCritics of the Nuremberg trials argued that the charges against the defendants were only defined as \"crimes\" after they were committed and that therefore the trial was invalid, and thus seen as a form of \"victor's justice\". \n\nAs Biddiss observed, \"the Nuremberg Trial continues to haunt us. ... It is a question also of the weaknesses and strengths of the proceedings themselves.\"\n\nQuincy Wright, writing eighteen months after the conclusion of the IMT, explained the opposition to the Tribunal thus:\n\nChief Justice of the United States Supreme Court Harlan Fiske Stone called the Nuremberg trials a fraud. \"(Chief U.S. prosecutor) Jackson is away conducting his high-grade lynching party in Nuremberg, ... I don't mind what he does to the Nazis, but I hate to see the pretense that he is running a court and proceeding according to common law. This is a little too sanctimonious a fraud to meet my old-fashioned ideas\", Stone wrote.\n\nJackson, in a letter discussing the weaknesses of the trial, in October 1945 told U.S. President Harry S. Truman that the Allies themselves \"have done or are doing some of the very things we are prosecuting the Germans for. The French are so violating the Geneva Convention in the treatment of prisoners of war that our command is taking back prisoners sent to them. We are prosecuting plunder and our Allies are practising it. We say aggressive war is a crime and one of our allies asserts sovereignty over the Baltic States based on no title except conquest.\"\n\nAssociate Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas charged that the Allies were guilty of \"substituting power for principle\" at Nuremberg. \"I thought at the time and still think that the Nuremberg trials were unprincipled,\" he wrote. \"Law was created \"ex post facto\" to suit the passion and clamor of the time.\"\n\nU.S. Deputy Chief Counsel Abraham Pomerantz resigned in protest at the low caliber of the judges assigned to try the industrial war criminals such as those at I.G. Farben.\n\nRobert A. Taft, a US Senate Majority Leader from Ohio and son of William Howard Taft, criticized the Nuremberg Trials for trying Nazi war criminals under \"ex post facto\" laws which resulted in his failure to secure the Republican nomination for President in 1948.\nA number of Germans who agreed with the idea of punishment for war crimes admitted trepidation concerning the trials. A contemporary German jurist said:\n\nThe validity of the court has been questioned on a number of grounds:\nOne criticism that was made of the IMT was that some treaties were not binding on the Axis powers because they were not signatories. This was addressed in the judgment relating to war crimes and crimes against humanity, which contains an expansion of customary law: \"the [Hague] Convention expressly stated that it was an attempt 'to revise the general laws and customs of war,' which it thus recognised to be then existing, but by 1939 these rules laid down in the Convention were recognised by all civilised nations, and were regarded as being declaratory of the laws and customs of war which are referred to in Article 6 (b) of the [London] Charter.\"\n\nThe Nuremberg Trials employed four official languages: English, French, German and Russian. In order to address the complex linguistic issues that clouded over the proceedings, interpretation and translation departments had to be established. However, it was feared that consecutive interpretation would slow down the proceedings significantly. What is therefore unique in both the Nuremberg tribunals and history of the interpretation profession was the introduction of an entirely new technique, extempore simultaneous interpretation. This technique of interpretation requires the interpreter to listen to a speaker in a source (or passive) language and orally translate that speech into another language in real time, that is, simultaneously, through headsets and microphones. Interpreters were split into four sections, one for each official language, with three interpreters per section working from the other three languages into the fourth (their mother tongue). For instance, the English booth consisted of three interpreters, one working from German into English, one working from French, and one from Russian, etc. Defendants who did not speak any of the four official languages were provided with consecutive court interpreters. Some of the languages heard over the course of the proceedings included Yiddish, Hungarian, Czech, Ukrainian, and Polish.\n\nThe equipment used to establish this system was provided by IBM, and included an elaborate setup of cables which were hooked up to headsets and single earphones directly from the four interpreting booths (often referred to as \"the aquarium\"). Four channels existed for each working language, as well as a root channel for the proceedings without interpretation. Switching of channels was controlled by a setup at each table in which the listener merely had to turn a dial in order to switch between languages. People tripping over the floor-laid cables often led to the headsets getting disconnected, with several hours at a time sometimes being taken in order to repair the problem and continue on with the trials.\n\nInterpreters were recruited and examined by the respective countries in which the official languages were spoken: the United States, United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, as well as in special cases Belgium and the Netherlands. Many were former translators, army personnel, and linguists, some were experienced consecutive interpreters, others were ordinary individuals and even recent secondary school-graduates who led international lives in multilingual environments. It was, and still is believed, that the qualities that made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.\nWith the simultaneous technique being extremely new, interpreters practically trained themselves, but many could not handle the pressure or the psychological strain. Many often had to be replaced, many returned to the translation department, and many left. Serious doubts were given as to whether interpretation provided a fair trial for the defendants, particularly because of fears of mistranslation and errors made on transcripts. The translation department had to also deal with the overwhelming problem of being understaffed and overburdened with an influx of documents that could not be kept up with. More often than not, interpreters were stuck in a session without having proper documents in front of them and were relied upon to do sight translation or double translation of texts, causing further problems and extensive criticism. Other problems that arose included complaints from lawyers and other legal professionals with regard to questioning and cross-examination. Legal professionals were most often appalled at the slower speed at which they had to conduct their task because of the extended time required for interpreters to render an interpretation properly. Also, a number of interpreters protested the idea of using vulgar language, especially if it referred to Jews or the conditions of the Nazi concentration camps. Bilingual/trilingual members who attended the trials picked up quickly on this aspect of character and were equally quick to file complaints.\n\nYet, despite the extensive trial and error, without the interpretation system the trials would not have been possible and in turn revolutionized the way multilingual issues were addressed in tribunals and conferences. A number of the interpreters following the trials were immediately recruited into the newly formed United Nations, while others returned to their ordinary lives, pursued other careers, or worked freelance. Outside the boundaries of the trials, many interpreters continued their positions on weekends interpreting for dinners, private meetings between judges, and excursions between delegates. Others worked as investigators or editors, or aided the translation department when they could, often using it as an opportunity to sharpen their skills and to correct poor interpretations on transcripts before they were available for public record.\n\nFor further reference, a book titled \"The Origins of Simultaneous Interpretation: The Nuremberg Trial\", written by interpreter Francesca Gaiba, was published by the University of Ottawa Press in 1998.\n\nToday, all major international organizations, as well as any conference or government that uses more than one official language, uses extempore simultaneous interpretation. Notable bodies include the Parliament of Kosovo with three official languages, the Parliament of Canada with two official languages, the Parliament of South Africa with eleven official languages, the European Union with twenty-four official languages, and the United Nations with six official working languages.\n\n\nThese citations refer to documents at \n\n\n\n"}

The festivities, taking place during the third weekend of October, draw thousands of tourists to the city each year.\n\nThe first Tyler Rose Festival was organized by Tyler Garden Club members, local rose growers and the Chamber of Commerce in October 1933 for the purpose of focusing attention on the importance of the rose industry to Tyler, and to showcase the towns elegance; it was renamed the Texas Rose Festival during the Texas Centennial in 1936. Aside from the festival's suspension during World War II, it has been an annual event.\n\nMany of the festival's events center on the Rose Queen and her court, who wear lavish gowns and costumes that are often in keeping with the theme of the year's festival. These participants generally come from wealthy backgrounds and often have long family histories with the festival; many have played various roles in the events since childhood. The queen and her court are chosen by the President of the Texas Rose Festival Association who works in the organization for 4 years before taking on the role as President.\n\nIn addition to the Rose Queen, the court includes:\nRose Queens include:\nRose Festival events open to the public generally include:\n\n\nThere are also many other events such as an art show; a car show; doll, bear and toy shows; an arts and crafts fair; and symphony concerts in the park.\n\nThe Rose Parade is easily the biggest part of the Rose Festival. This parade takes place on the Saturday morning of the festival, and starts on Fifth St. and travels down Erwin to the Rose Stadium where it ends.

{"id": "21986358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21986358", "title": "The Last Temptations", "text": "The Last Temptations\n\nThe Last Temptations () is an opera in two acts by Joonas Kokkonen to a libretto by Lauri Kokkonen. Along with Leevi Madetoja's \"Pohjalaisia\" and Aarre Merikanto's \"Juha\", it is considered one of the most important Finnish operas. The opera deals with the life of the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century folk preacher Paavo Ruotsalainen. Kokkonen worked on the opera for 16 years before finishing the work. It was premiered in Helsinki by the Finnish National Opera in 1975.\n\nThe opera consists of two acts divided in 14 scenes. The combining element of the work is the hymn number 382 in the current Finnish hymnal of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland, \"My Lord, my God in all distress\" (382) which is a reoccurring theme throughout the opera. A chorus containing the whole hymn concludes the opera.\n\nAfter the premiere, the opera has already had almost three hundred performances. Finnish National Opera toured with the work in seven cities abroad – including at New York's Metropolitan Opera. At the Finnish National Opera there have been three productions: 1975–1983 (directed by Sakari Puurunen) and 1994 (directed by Paavo Liski) and 2001 (directed by Jussi Tapola).\n\nThe Savonlinna Opera Festival performed the opera for several years, 1977–1980. In Helsinki and Savonlinna the most famous singers in the role of Paavo were Martti Talvela and Jaakko Ryhänen.\n\nIn 2007 the opera was performed as a half-staged production in the Temppeliaukio church in Helsinki four times. Finnish film director Åke Lindman directed \"The Last Temptations\" on the original homestead of Paavo Ruotsalainen in Aholansaari, Nilsiä, Finland during four summers in 2000–2003 from where the production was transferred to new outdoor arena in Nilsiä to be performed in summer 2007.\n\nA renewed full-scale production of the opera saw light in summer 2009 in Nivala, Finland. In the roles were baritone Esa Ruuttunen as Paavo, soprano Johanna Rusanen-Kartano as Riitta, Petri Pussila as smith and Lassi Virtanen, first man.\n\nThe popularity of the opera has lasted over the years. In 2015 it was produced by Pohjois-Kymi music school. Esa Ruuttunen sang the role of Paavo Ruotsalainen.\n\n\n\"Scene 1: Paavo's Deathbed\"\n\nOn a stormy winter night Paavo tosses on his bed in fever. He calls for Riitta, his deceased first wife. His second wife Anna Loviisa and servant Albertiina enter. They try to comfort Paavo by singing his favorite hymn. Paavo sobers up but shouting orders the women to leave for, as he says, to Heaven's gate he must go alone.\n\n\"Interlude I\"\n\n\"Scene 2: Riitta at the Dance\"\n\nPaavo relives in his hallucinations key events of his life. In his youth he meet Riitta at a dance. Three men and three women mock him and warn Riitta not to go with Paavo, a madman, for it will only bring her misery. Nevertheless, Riitta decides to go with Paavo. Riitta calls for Paavo and encourages him, but he refuses and says that he must go the barrier of Heavan alone.\n\n\"Interlude II\"\n\n\"Scene 3: The Smith\"\n\nRiitta takes Paavo to visit the smith who had instilled faith in him in his youth, blacksmith Jaakko (Jakob) Högman. Riitta accuses the blacksmith for compelling Paavo to wander around in revivalist meetings, leaving family behind to starve. The blacksmith retorts contemptuously to Riitta, but then adds that the gate of Heaven is open to those who suffer and toil. Paavo mutters that he is too weak to open the gate.\n\n\"Interlude III\"\n\n\"Scene 4: The Frost\"\n\nPaavo and Riitta are at their first homestead by the lake. Paavo promises to build a new house, but a wicker gate ominously reminds him of the Barrier of Heaven which he dare not approach. The chorus comments how Paavo took Riitta to the backwoods to a life of misery. The white frost suddenly rises, threatening the crop. Riitta and Paavo together try to fight it to no use. In the struggle to move the air on the field they trample their baby underfoot.\n\n\"Interlude IV\"\n\n\"Scene 5: Juhana\"\n\nPaavo's son Juhana is repairing his father's knapsack. Juhana is longing to get away from the dreary existence to a wider world. He dances at the thought and teases his mother. She snatches the knapsack away to hide it from Paavo, to keep him from leaving the family for his travels.\n\n\"Interlude V\"\n\n\"Scene 6: The Last Loaf\"\n\nPaavo demands his knapsack back. Riitta shouts back complaining about him always wandering, not caring for work or family. Riitta threatens to kill Paavo to spare him the shame of starving his family. She hurls the axe at him, but misses. Paavo tries to explain and reconcile the needs of the family and the overriding importance of spreading the Gospel. He thinks that what he has done was in vain. He calls out for Riitta, but cannot find her.\n\n\"Interlude VI\"\n\n\"Scene 7: Juhana's Death Revealed\"\n\nVillage women come to the house. They look at the dent left by the axe Riitta threw at Paavo. They tell her in a roundabout way that Juhana has been murdered. They wonder why Riitta does not weep. She replies that she wept for him for three whole years. Paavo has been listening, and cries that all his life God has been scourging and punishing him with an iron whip, and he has deserved it.\n\n\"Interlude VII\"\n\n\"Scene 8: Riitta's Death\"\n\nRiitta is dying three years later. She feels calm and remembers the happy illusion of the first homestead on the island, where Paavo used to sing thanks to God's blessings. Paavo is surprised: Riitta can give thanks. Yes, she replies, and sees the barrier of Heaven open in front of her. She asks Paavo to recite a thanksgiving hymn. He sings and Juhana joins in. Riitta rises and goes toward her son to Heaven's door.\n\n\"Scene 1: The Assizes\"\n\nThree men want to confound Paavo at the place where he once had to defend himself at the Assizes against charges of undermining the authority of the Church. They feed Paavo's depression and reveal themselves as his enemies. They humiliate his arrogance and taunt him with dancing girls. Paavo collapses in despair, but the chorus sings a hymn of encouragement.\n\n\"Interlude I\"\n\n\"Scene 2: The Fisherman\"\n\nRiitta appears, calling Paavo to the Island. Paavo insists his calling to speak to the nation. \"Into the sea of men I cast a net all flaming with it I search for sinful wretches..\" Riitta repeats the call, but he insists he must speak at the graduation ceremony in Helsinki.\n\n\"Interlude II\"\n\n\"Scene 3: The Graduation\"\n\nAt the University graduation Paavo wants to go as an invited guest, but three men and three women stop him. They tell him he is uneducated idiot who has no business at the University ceremony. Paavo retorts that he has read religious tracts since he was a boy. He hears his own hymn sung and tries to address the academics. Paavo tries to follow the Bishop of the North, but is rejected. He calls out a prayer.\n\n\"Interlude III\"\n\n\"Scene 4: The Call to the Island\"\n\nRiitta calls Paavo to the Island. He resists. He doubts he would be welcome. Finally he yields to Riitta's pleas, but objecting he is but a wretched sinner.\n\n\"Interlude IV\"\n\n\"Scene 5: The Dead\"\n\nPaavo is praying for forgiveness. The blacksmith appears, encouraging him, then Riitta with a thanksgiving, then Juhana, singing the Lord's Prayer. It is time for Paavo to settle accounts of his life. His time has come.\n\n\"Interlude V\"\n\"Scene 6: Paavo's Death\"\n\nPaavo is lying on his bed in the cottage. He is still tossing around and crying. Gradually he comes round, surrounded by family. The three men and three women who have tormented him turn out to be his daughters and their husbands. Paavo recognizes that his time has come. He makes sure that his will is in order, and tells his family to plant a prickly tree on his grave, for he has been the prickliest of men. He asks the servant to read to him from the favorite tract, and begins to sing his hymn. Everyone gradually joins in; Paavo goes quiet and listens. He hear Riitta in the distance, calling him to the Island. Paavo praises God. He knows that he has overcome.\n\n1990 (Original release 1978).

Poe later wrote that the flippant tone of the story made it easy for educated readers to see through the supposed hoax.\n\nThe story opens with the delivery to a crowd gathered in Rotterdam of a manuscript detailing the journey of a man named Hans Pfaall. The manuscript, which comprises the majority of the story, sets out in detail how Pfaall contrived to reach the moon by benefit of a revolutionary new balloon and a device which compresses the vacuum of space into breathable air. The journey takes him nineteen days, and the narrative includes descriptions of the Earth from space as well as the descent to its fiery, volcanic satellite. Pfaall withholds most of the information regarding the surface of the moon and its inhabitants in order to negotiate a pardon from the Burgomaster for several murders he committed as he left earth (creditors of his who were becoming irksome). After reading the manuscript, the city authorities agree that Pfaall should be pardoned, but the messenger who brought them the text (apparently a resident of the moon) has vanished and they are unable to restore communication with him.\n\nPoe's story may have had an influence on, and is referenced in Jules Verne's \"From the Earth to the Moon\", which seems to be a retelling of the story. Poe later published a similar hoax, \"The Balloon-Hoax\", in the \"New York Sun\". \n\n\n"}

BOOM!) is a musical written by American composer Jonathan Larson, who won a Pulitzer and three Tony Awards for his musical \"Rent\". \"Tick, Tick... Boom!\" tells the story of an aspiring composer named Jon, who lives in New York City in 1990. Jon is worried he has made the wrong career choice to be part of the performing arts. The story is autobiographical, as stated by Larson's father in the liner notes of the cast recording – Larson had been trying to establish himself in theater since the early 1980s.\n\nLarson began to perform the piece as a solo work in 1990. After his death in 1996, it was revised and revamped by playwright David Auburn as a three-actor piece and was premiered Off-Broadway in 2001. Since then, the show has had a Off-West End production, a West End production, an American national tour, two Off-Broadway revivals in 2014 and 2016, and numerous local and international productions.\n\nThe show was first performed Off-Off-Broadway in September 1990 by Jonathan Larson in a workshop at the Second Stage Theatre under the title \"Boho Days\". Larson revised the developing piece following Second Stage, changing the title to \"Tick, Tick... Boom!\", and presented with him as performer in November 1991 at the Village Gate (with college pal Victoria Leacock producing), and then later in 1992 and 1993 in the \"O Solo Mio\" fests at New York Theatre Workshop. Larson performed the show as a \"rock monologue,\" a new form of theatre for the time. The performance attracted the attention of a young producer named Jeffrey Seller, who became a fan of Larson's work. In 1995, he saw the New York Theatre Workshop production of Larson's musical \"Rent\" and convinced his fellow producers to bring it to Broadway.\n\nAfter Larson's death in 1996, Leacock asked David Auburn, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning play \"Proof\", to reconfigure \"Tick, Tick...Boom!\". He restructured the monologue into a three actor musical, with one actor playing Jon and the other two actors playing Michael and Susan, as well as all the other roles in the show. Also, the script and score were streamlined and edited. This revised version of the piece premiered Off-Broadway at the Jane Street Theater on May 23, 2001. Auburn received credit as \"Script Consultant\".\n\nOver a persistent ticking sound, Jon introduces himself: “The sound you are hearing is not a technical problem. It is not a musical cue. It is not a joke. It is the sound of one man's mounting anxiety. I... am that man.” Jon is an aspiring composer for musical theatre, who lives in SoHo, New York. He is nearing his 30th birthday and worries about his aging and lack of achievement (“30/90”). Michael, a friend of Jon's since childhood, gave up acting to pursue a more lucrative career as a research executive. Susan, Jon's girlfriend, is a dancer who teaches ballet to “wealthy and untalented children.”\n\nSusan and Jon discuss the upcoming 30th birthday party that she is throwing for him. She pressures him to play “Happy Birthday to You” to himself on the piano at the party, but he is hesitant because it reminds him of the aging aspect of birthdays. Michael wants to schedule a job interview for Jon with Michael's firm. Again, Jon is hesitant, but agrees to think it over. Later, on the roof of his apartment building, Jon reveals that he is also nervous about an upcoming workshop of his newest musical, \"SUPERBIA.\" Susan comes to join him; he comments on her dress and how beautiful it makes her look (“Green Green Dress”).\n\nThe next morning, Jon is awake early. Susan asks him about the possibility of leaving New York. Susan wants to raise a family and doesn’t view that as compatible with Jon's “starving artist” lifestyle. Jon is torn between following his dream of composing and opting for security and family in a different career. Meanwhile, the other two main characters recap their views on what Jon should do (“Johnny Can’t Decide”). Jon's reverie, however, is cut short; he needs to report to his day job as a waiter in a SoHo diner (“Sunday”).\n\nAfter work, Michael picks Jon up in his brand new BMW to show Jon his new apartment. Michael exults at the thought of a life of luxury (“No More”), and pressures Jon further to consider changing his career path. Frustrated, Jon finally agrees to accompany Michael to work the next day and visit a brainstorming session at his firm. Back at home, Jon phones his parents and then his agent. He plans to spend the remainder of the evening composing, but he is interrupted by a call from Susan, who wants to see him. They argue, albeit in a passive and psychological manner that scarcely seems like an argument at all (“Therapy”).\n\nOn Monday morning, Jon walks to Michael's office for his brainstorming session. On the way, Jon thinks back to a workshop in which his work was reviewed by a composer “so legendary his name may not be uttered aloud…” (“St----- S-------”). He also worries about his musical style and its place on Broadway, but has little time to develop this train of thought before he arrives at Michael's firm. The brainstorming session involves naming a cooking fat substitute through a convoluted “idea-generating” process. Jon sees the futility of the process, and his unwillingness to cooperate gets him removed from the meeting. Later, as Jon drives Michael to the airport for a business trip, they argue about the meeting. Michael tells Jon that the life Susan wants doesn’t sound bad, and that he wishes his job could give him the chance to settle down (“Real Life”).\n\nAfter dropping Michael off, Jon goes to a rehearsal for \"SUPERBIA,\" but not before stopping to get a snack of Twinkies (“Sugar”). At the market, he spies Karessa Johnson, one of his actors for \"SUPERBIA.\" She reveals a similar weakness for Twinkies, and this leads to a sudden friendship between the two. After the rehearsal, Susan sees Jon and Karessa walking together and becomes jealous. She informs Jon that she's gotten a job in Northampton, Massachusetts which may be permanent. Jon and Susan argue about the state of their relationship; in a turnaround from the events leading up to “Therapy,” Jon begs Susan to stay and be with him. Despite this, she leaves for home, and Jon thinks about what may have happened to make her behave this way (“See Her Smile”).\n\nThe next morning, Jon arrives early at the theatre for the workshop of \"SUPERBIA.\" Although initially the theatre is empty, soon it is filled with very important people: Jon's family and friends, as well as Broadway producers and artists, including Jon's idol, St----- S-------. Karessa steals the show with her performance of “Come to Your Senses”. The workshop is a success, and Jon gets many congratulations; but there are no offers to produce \"SUPERBIA\" on or off Broadway. Jon is no closer to being a professional composer, and so, in his eyes, the workshop has been a failure.\n\nAfter the workshop, Jon visits Michael and tells him that he is through with music. For the first time, though, Michael tries to persuade him to stick with it. Michael says that while he enjoys how he makes a lot more money now than he did as a starving artist, he finds the job itself to be emotionally banal and unrewarding. The two argue, and Jon yells at Michael for not understanding fear or insecurity. Michael responds by telling Jon that he is HIV-positive. Shocked at this news, Jon leaves quickly.\n\nDistressed and alone, Jon wanders through Central Park until he finds himself in the abandoned theater inside Belvedere Castle. He finds an old rehearsal piano, and begins to play it while collecting his thoughts. Jon ponders on whether the amount of sacrifice required for his career in music is worth it, and whether those telling him to “have it all, play the game” are right (“Why”). Ultimately, he realizes that he will only be happy as a professional composer, no matter what hardships that may bring.\n\nThe next morning is Jon's thirtieth birthday party (“30/90 Reprise”). He sees Susan, who is getting ready to leave. She gives him his birthday gift: a thousand sheets of blank manuscript paper. They agree to write to each other, and she leaves. Michael gives him a birthday gift of belts (Michael thinks belts are a sign of luxury). The phone rings, and the caller is Stephen Sondheim. Sondheim leaves Jon his contact information so they can meet and discuss \"SUPERBIA\". Jon realizes that he is surrounded by friends and that his talents are finally being recognized. He says, “the tick tick booms are softer now. I can barely hear them, and I think if I play loud enough I can drown them out completely.” Jon sits down at his piano to play “Happy Birthday to You.”\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn July 2018, it was announced that Lin-Manuel Miranda would direct a film adaptation of \"Tick, Tick... Boom!\". The film will be produced by Ron Howard and Brian Grazer, and written by Steven Levenson. The film would be Miranda's feature-length directorial debut.\n\n"}

Developed gradually by Robert Morton Nance during and before the 1930s, it derived its name from its standardisation of the variant spellings of traditional Cornish MSS. Nance's recommended spelling and grammar, based on Middle Cornish, soon supplanted Henry Jenner's system, which had been based largely on Late Cornish. Most of the older generation of Cornish users alive today would have started under this system. It was also the form originally used by Gorsedh Kernow, although they now use the new Standard Written Form.\n\nIn the 1980s, Unified Cornish came under heavy criticism, leading to the creation of Kernewek Kemmyn (KK) and Modern Cornish (also called, Revived Late Cornish, \"RLC\"). Some Cornish speakers continued to employ Unified Cornish nonetheless.\n\nIn the 1990s, yet another variety emerged when Unified Cornish Revised (UCR) (, \"KUA\") was devised by Nicholas Williams.\n\nIn May 2008 the Cornish Language Partnership agreed on a single written form of Cornish to be known as the Standard Written Form (SWF) to be used by Cornwall Council authorities for the purposes of education and public life. The Cornish Language Partnership has specified that \"Furv Skrifys Savonek\" (FSS) is the SWF translation for \"Standard Written Form\". Users of UCR and KS prefer the term \"Form Screfys Standard\". \n\nIn September 2008 Agan Tavas reaffirmed its support for Unified Cornish, as well as for the SWF and for Kernowek Standard.\n\n\n"}
