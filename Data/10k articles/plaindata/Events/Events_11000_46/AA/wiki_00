The summit theme was \"Energy and Development.\"\n\nThe gathering brought together leaders, representatives and policymakers from non-aligned nations. African G-15 nations are Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and Zimbabwe. Those from Asia are India, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. Latin American G-15 nations include Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela.\n\nThe Group of 15 was established at the Ninth Non-Aligned Movement summit in Belgrade, Yugoslavia in September 1989. The name of the group is unchanging, but its composition has expanded to 18 countries.\n\nThe G-15 is composed of countries from Africa, Asia, North America and South America. These non-aligned nations joined together to create a forum to foster cooperation and develop information which can be presented to other international groups, such as the World Trade Organization and the Group of Eight. The G-15 nations have a common goal of enhanced growth and prosperity. The group aims to encourage cooperation among developing countries in the areas of investment, trade, and technology.\n\nThose G-15 nations represented at the summit were Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. The group's membership has expanded to 18 countries, but the name has remained unchanged.\n\nThe leaders of G-15 nations are core contributors in summit meetings. but only some of the heads-of-state were at the Caracas event:\n\nThe Group of 77 was represented by Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser of Qatar . United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Secretary General Rubens Ricupero attended the summit.\n\nThe G-15 nations perceive an ongoing need to expand dialogue with the G8 nations. The G-15 want to help bridge the gap between developing countries and the more developed and industrialized nations. For example, the G-15 converted this venue into an opportunity to express concern about the delays and limited progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.\n\nG-15 nations are united by shared perceptions of global economic issues; and the G-15 provides a structure for developing common strategies for dealing with these issues.\n\nG15 nations have joined together in hopes of escaping from the more polemical atmosphere in other multinational groups and organizations, such as the Group of 77 (G-77).\n\nThe summit provides an opportunity to focus on the importance of cooperation in facing challenges of food, energy, climate change, health and trade. Delegations from 19 nations met to discuss energy cooperation between member states and fighting poverty.\nBilateral meetings between the Venezuelan and Iranian presidents resulted in During his stay in Caracas for the G-15 conference, Iranian President an announcement of US$700 million to be invested by Iran in Venezuela's state-owned aluminum industry and the corollary transfer of Venezuelan aluminum-processing technology to Iran.\n\nVenezuelan President Hugo Chávez announced his intention to create an international television network that would present information and films created in the South. Telesur was launched the following year.\n\nAn estimated 11,000 soldiers and national guards were deployed in security operations for the summit. Violence broke out in the streets of Caracas. Clashes involving antigovernment demonstrators caused at least 2 deaths and 14 wounded by gunfire. Demonstrators tried to break a security perimeter established by the Venezuelan Army a kilometer away from where the G-15 leaders were meeting.\n\n\n"}

Among the most notable participants were the Movement Against Illegal Immigration, the main organiser of rallies, Eurasian Youth Union, the Communist Youth Vanguard, Dmitry Demushkin, the National State Party of Russia and the State Duma deputy Nikolay Kuryanovich who was excluded from the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia for his sympathy with the March. Other participants were the National Patriotic Front \"Memory\", the \"Truth\" Community, the Russian National Union, the Russian Social Movement and the \"Russian Order\" Movement. The final destination for gatherings in Moscow became the Slavyanskaya Square, though the March was banned by city mayor Yuriy Luzhkov on 31 October. Despite condemning the xenophobic nature of The March, the Deputy Chief of the Moscow branch of Yabloko Alexey Navalny advocated for the permission of the event in the framework of freedom of assembly.\n\nBesides Moscow, the March was planned in Saint Petersburg, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, Chita, Stavropol, Maykop, Tyumen, Vladivostok, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Blagoveshchensk, Nizhniy Novgorod and Kaliningrad, but was banned in the majority of cities as well. Irkutsk officially allowed the March. The rallies took place also in Ukraine (Kiev, Crimea, Odessa, Sevastopol), Moldova (Chişinău, Tiraspol) and Tbilisi. The Heads of Russian Youth of Moldova and Eurasian Youth Union of the Republic of Moldova have been arrested. Even though the use of Nazi symbols was prohibited by the organizers, a flag with conventionalized swastika was raised by the Head of SS-Slavic Union Dmitriy Demushkin in Moscow.\n\nBanning the march in Moscow, mayor Yuriy Luzhkov said: \"If we allow our state to be split on ethnic or interconfessional grounds, if we allow religious wars, then I am afraid this will be the end of Russia.\" A counter-protest in Moscow by left-wing demonstrators drew about 500 people carrying banners with slogans such as \"Russian Anti-Fascist Front\" and \"I am Russian and therefore not a fascist.\" The Russian March was also opposed by the Moscow Bureau for Human Rights and Russian Jewish community headed by rabbi Berel Lazar. Krasnoyarsk youth organizations \"Together!\", \"Krasnoyarsk Regional Student Squads\", \"Krasnoyarsk Youth Forum\", \"Yenisey Patriots\" and \"Youth Guards of United Russia\" have prepared a written appeal to Governor of Krasnoyarsk Oblast Alexander Khloponin and city mayor Pyotr Pimashkov to prevent holding of Russian March in the city. However the Movement Against Illegal Immigration told Reuters it would go ahead with their gatherings regardless of whether they were authorized or not.\nA separate mass-meeting called the Right March have been organized by several Orthodox movements (the National Council, the Orthodox Standard Bearers Union and The Bastion), which declared their independent intentions.\n\nThe first Russian March took place on 4 November 2005 and was the first legal far-right mass meeting in modern Russian history. Both rallies have been inspired by expulsion of Polish-Lithuanian forces from the Moscow Kremlin during the Russo-Polish War of 1605–1618 on 22 October O.S. (4 November N.S.), which was subsequently marked by tsar in 1612 as a feast day. The preparations for 2006 March have been launched by the Action Against Illegal Immigrantion and Eurasian Youth Union. Due to this the march has had two different names and two different schedules.\n\n"}

{"id": "46741983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46741983", "title": "Affair of the Dancing Lamas", "text": "Affair of the Dancing Lamas\n\nThe Affair of the Dancing Lamas was an Anglo–Tibetan diplomatic controversy stemming mainly from the visit to Britain in 1924–25 of a party of Tibetan monks (only one of whom was a lama) as part of a publicity stunt for \"The Epic of Everest\" – the official film of the 1924 British Mount Everest Expedition.\n\nThe Dalai Lama and the government of Tibet felt that the film and the pseudo-religious performances required of the monks ridiculed Tibetan culture – as a diplomatic protest they banned future Everest expeditions. The film had been the responsibility of John Noel, the expedition's photographer, but the mountaineering establishment was closely involved and to avoid embarrassment they shifted the blame for the ban on expeditions onto John de Vars Hazard, another member of the team, who had gone exploring off the authorised route. The true cause of the diplomatic fuss was kept secret and Hazard remained the scapegoat for over fifty years.\n\nHistorically, Tibet had not been willing to allow foreign explorers into the country but the 1921 British expedition had been permitted in connection with an arms deal. Monastic opposition to the arms and the expeditions increased until by 1925 the country was close to revolution. The Tibetan army chief was closely associated with the British and the debacle was probably partly responsible for his fall from grace in 1925. The subsequent decline of military influence within the Tibetan government may have made the country more vulnerable to the Chinese takeover in 1950.\n\nFearing Russian military intervention into Tibet, in 1904 the British Raj made a military incursion into Tibet led by Francis Younghusband. Sometimes known as the \"Mission to Lhasa\", this was largely instigated by Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India. The ensuing 1904 treaty and 1906 convention formalised Chinese suzerainty over Tibet while declaring that it would permit no foreign interventions (including by Russia or Britain). In 1910 China invaded Tibet and to escape the savagery the Dalai Lama fled to Sikkim, where he was sheltered by the British. Sikkim, sandwiched between India and Tibet, was under firm British protection and was only nominally an independent state.\nFollowing the Xinhai Revolution, which established the Republic of China in 1912, China withdrew from Tibet. The Dalai Lama returned to Lhasa and Britain briefly supplied armaments to what it now regarded as an independent country but the First World War in Europe led to Britain losing interest. By 1919 a renewed fear of Russia and China felt by both Britain and Tibet led to a mutual desire for closer diplomatic relations. Charles Bell, Britain's political representative in Sikkim, was sent to Lhasa at the end of 1920 to negotiate. He was the first European to be invited to Lhasa and he stayed for almost a whole year. Bell and Thubten Gyatso, the Dalai Lama, developed a warm personal friendship. In 1921, Britain again started supplying Tibet with arms, ammunition, military support and training.\n\nOn his 1904 military mission, Younghusband had seen Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. and had enthused Curzon with the idea of a grand British imperial expedition to make the first ascent of the mountain. Eventually this led to Britain's magisterial Alpine Club adopting the idea in celebration of its 1907 golden jubilee. Mount Everest lies on the border between Nepal and Tibet but neither country would allow entry to foreign expeditions. The Secretary of State for India refused to request permission from Tibet and then the 1914–18 War intervened.\n\nIn 1913 John Noel had entered Tibet clandestinely and had reached to within forty miles of Mount Everest, closer than any other foreigner before him. After the war, in an attempt to inject new impetus, Noel was invited to address a joint meeting of the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club. Noel's 1919 talk was inspirational and the two societies again started lobbying. Younghusband (soon to become president of the RGS) wrote to the Secretary of State for India to see if Tibet could be asked for permission. Even with the political backing of Lord Curzon, who was now Britain's Foreign Secretary (and who had been RGS president from 1911 to 1914), Younghusband only received lukewarm support from Whitehall but was still able to send Charles Howard-Bury to India to try to take things forward. Howard-Bury met the Viceroy of India, Lord Chelmsford, who was sympathetic but said he could do nothing while negotiations with Tibet were pending, although he suggested that Charles Bell should be approached. By serendipity, Howard-Bury met Bell shortly before Bell's diplomatic visit to Lhasa. As a small piece in the diplomatic jigsaw, Bell negotiated that British expeditions be allowed into Tibet, starting with the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition. However, in the minds of the Tibetan elite, Everest expeditions became associated with military expansionism within the country.\n\nEarly in 1921 the Mount Everest Committee was set up jointly by the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club to manage all future British expeditions – Younghusband was appointed chairman.\n\nJohn Noel was photographer on the 1922 Everest expedition and was made responsible for producing the subsequent official film, \"Climbing Mount Everest\". Shown in cinemas around Britain it had been a reasonable success. When the 1924 expedition was being planned Noel offered to fund £8,000 of the estimated £9,000 total cost of the expedition if he was allowed to make a second film and retain all the rights to it and other photography. Noel, who was quite a showman, was determined to make the film a success and he planned filming in such a way that he could produce a mountaineering epic if the summit attempt succeeded or a Tibet travelogue if it failed.\n\nOn 8 June 1924 Mallory and Irvine set off for the summit, never to return.\n\nFor those on the expedition at the time, the loss of Mallory and Irvine did not seem like the magnificent tragedy it was soon to become. Noel raced back to civilisation to start work on his film; John Hazard went to the West Rongbuk Glacier to do further surveying but then went beyond his remit by going north to Lhatse and the upper part of the Tsangpo River; the others went to the Rongshar Valley to recuperate before the long trek home. In Britain matters were treated differently – the climbers' memorial service in St Paul's Cathedral was attended by King George V, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York.\n\n\"The Times\" had the scoop headline \"Everest: The Last Climb: Hopes That Summit Was Reached\", and Noel's 1924 film, according to Wade Davis, \"elevated Mallory ... into the realm of the Titans\". Noel's film \"The Epic of Everest: The Immortal Film Record of This Historic Expedition\" had its premiere at the New Scala Theatre on 8 December 1924.\n\nA production company \"Explorers' Films\", with Younghusband as chairman, had been set up to make the film. Because there was no film footage high on the mountain and it was not known if the summit had been reached, Noel planned a total theatrical experience. The stage setting was a Tibetan courtyard with shimmering Himalayan peaks painted on the backdrop. To provide what Noel called \"large doses of local colour\", before the film started a group of monks was to come on stage equipped with ethnic accoutrements to perform pseudo-religious music, chanting and dance. The headline in the \"Daily Sketch\" \"High Dignitaries of Tibetan Church Reach London; Bishop to dance on Stage; Music from Skulls\" was not couched in terms that the Tibetan authorities would wish for. The performers were genuinely monks (despite the publicity proclaiming \"seven lamas\", there was in reality only\none) but they were from nowhere near Mount Everest and they had been inveigled out of Tibet without permission from their superior. To the satisfaction of the press when the monks went to the London Zoo they were shown the llamas. To begin with the show was a critical and public success. It toured Britain and Germany and over a million people in the United States and Canada went to see it. However, the political difficulties turned things sour and by the end of 1925 \"Explorers' Films\" had gone bankrupt in Colombo, requiring the Mount Everest Committee to send £150 to get the monks back to India. Only a few of them returned to Tibet and those who did were severely punished.\n\nThe government of Tibet lodged an official diplomatic protest. They believed that the film, and its accompanying carnival, ridiculed Tibet. They found particularly offensive a scene showing a man delousing a child and then eating the lice. After seeing the performance the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India wrote that it was \"unspeakably boring\" but that it could not cause \"more than that smile of kindly superiority which we generally assume when we see or hear of strange customs\".\nThe Dalai Lama regarded the film and the monks' performances as a direct affront to his religion and called for the arrest of the monks.\nNoel initially said he had received official permission to take them from Tibet but this was found to be false. In Britain an official inquiry reported, \"Captain Noel's statement about the monks taken to England is in direct variance with the facts\". The Mount Everest Committee was forced into an apology: \"The Committee regret very deeply the humiliating position in which they were placed by the discovery that Captain Noel's statements were incorrect\". The prime minister of Tibet's note demanding the monks' return ended with \"For the future, we cannot give permission to go to Tibet\" and no more expeditions were allowed until 1933.\n\nIn Tibet the matter was extremely sensitive because at the time that country was close to revolution. The modernisation and militarisation being introduced\nby the Dalai Lama and the head of the army, Tsarong Dzasa, were deeply unacceptable to the governing religious conservatives who were opposed to any British presence or influence. They had good reason to be so opposed – Britain was secretly trying to provoke an uprising in support of the military, although this ultimately failed and Tsarong had to escape to Sikkim.\n\nThe affair may have had long-term effects beyond mountaineering – when China invaded in 1950 Tibet no longer had an effective army and could offer little military resistance.\n\nThe Mount Everest Committee was unable to distance itself from the film – it had supported its production and benefited financially. It therefore laid the blame elsewhere for the diplomatic catastrophe and for over fifty years the cover-up succeeded in public, the impression being given that Hazard's unauthorised detour was to blame for the ban on expeditions.\n\nIn 1969, as the last item under \"Accidents, Equipment and Miscellaneous Notes\", the Alpine Club in its \"Alpine Journal\" reported the death of John Hazard (spelling his name incorrectly) and made it clear that he had never been a Club member. The obituary said he had been \"something of a misfit\", best remembered for leaving four Sherpas behind at the North Col in 1924, requiring \"very risky rescue operations\" by other members of the party. After the expedition, he had gone off the main route with \"a porter or two to the Tsango Po river on a jaunt of his own\". The report concluded that such detours had been acceptable in 1921 and apologised for in 1922, but in 1924 it was the last straw and Lhasa had clamped down on expeditions for nine years. In the 1990 \"Alpine Journal\"s obituary of John Noel the dancing lamas are not mentioned at all.\n\nBy 1996, however, the \"Alpine Journal\" was willing to publish an article entitled \"The Scapegoat\" by Audrey Salkeld, the Everest historian. In it she reviews Hazard's life and his role concerning the Sherpas on the North Col and his unauthorised Tsangpo journey. She concludes that the Tibetans' strongest complaint was over the monks' publicity visit and credits Walt Unsworth with uncovering the \"dancing lama furore\" in 1981. The diplomatic affair had been swept under the carpet for over fifty years because Younghusband (president of the RGS and chairman of the Mount Everest Committee) must have been aware of, or even a party to, the scheme to invite the monks.\n\nIn 1981 Walt Unsworth revealed in his book \"Everest\" that \"The Affair of the Dancing Lamas\" was the primary reason why Mount Everest expeditions had been again banned by Tibet. The main blame for the diplomatic incident is indeed laid on Noel rather than Hazard but Unsworth views the position of the Tibetan government differently from the more recent accounts of Hansen and Davis, whose analysis has been given above.\n\nWhen in 1921 Charles Bell retired from being effectively the British diplomatic service for Sikkim and Tibet, Frederick Bailey took over. Whereas Bell had been a classical scholar and Tibetologist, Bailey was an adventurer. He had accompanied Younghusband to Lhasa on his 1904 \"mission\" and later had made a lengthy, arduous and illegal excursion into Tibet to explore the Tsangpo Gorge. As poacher turned gamekeeper he went out of his way to hinder expeditions to Tibet – or at least that was the view of the mountaineering establishment in London. Unsworth says it was for reasons unknown, possibly personal ambition, whereas Salkeld says he was believed to have scores to settle with the Mount Everest Committee. He was exceptionally well placed to be awkward as he was the single point of contact between London and Lhasa and so was inevitably involved in passing on and composing diplomatic notes for both sides. Unsworth supports the \"Mount Everest Committee view\" in seeing Bailey as the creator of much of the antipathy towards expeditions whilst relying on mere acquiescence from Lhasa. Hansen explicitly rejects this view and regards it as a British \"orientalist\" attitude that people in Tibet were merely primitive and backward. He criticises Unsworth (and the Mount Everest Committee and others) for denying any independent agency to the Tibetans. Hansen claims that Lhasa did indeed drive the diplomatic protests for rational reasons and Bailey tended to go along with them. The authors agree that the India Office in London became enraged by the Mount Everest Committee's indiscretions and it suited everyone concerned in the debacle to keep the whole thing quiet.\n\n"}

During the 1980s he was a member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He was called the \"godfather of glasnost\" as he is considered to be the intellectual force behind Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program of glasnost and perestroika.\n\nYakovlev was the first Soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret protocols of the 1939 Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact with Nazi Germany.\n\nYakovlev was born to a peasant family in a tiny village (Красные Ткачи - Krasnyye Tkachi) on the Volga River near Yaroslavl. He served in the Red Army during World War II, being badly wounded in the Nazi siege of Leningrad, and became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1944. Beginning in 1958, he was an exchange student at Columbia University in the United States for one year.\n\nYakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the CPSU's Department of Ideology and Propaganda from 1969 to 1973. In 1972 he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled \"Against Antihistoricism\" critical of Russian nationalism and nationalism in the Soviet Union in general. As a result, he was removed from his position and appointed as ambassador to Canada as punishment, remaining at that post for a decade.\n\nDuring this time, he and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau became close friends. Trudeau's second son, Alexandre Trudeau, was given the Russian nickname \"Sacha\" after Yakovlev's.\n\nIn 1983, Yakovlev accompanied Mikhail Gorbachev, who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two renewed their earlier friendship and, tentatively at first, began to discuss the prospect of liberalisation in the Soviet Union.\n\nIn an interview years later, Yakovlev recalled:\nAt first we kind of sniffed around each other and our conversations didn't touch on serious issues. And then, verily, history plays tricks on one, we had a lot of time together as guests of then Liberal Minister of Agriculture Eugene Whelan in Canada who, himself, was too late for the reception because he was stuck with some striking farmers somewhere. So we took a long walk on that Minister's farm and, as it often happens, both of us suddenly were just kind of flooded and let go. I somehow, for some reason, threw caution to the wind and started telling him about what I considered to be utter stupidities in the area of foreign affairs, especially about those SS-20 missiles that were being stationed in Europe and a lot of other things. And he did the same thing. We were completely frank. He frankly talked about the problems in the internal situation in Russia. He was saying that under these conditions, the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom, the country would simply perish. So it was at that time, during our three-hour conversation, almost as if our heads were knocked together, that we poured it all out and during that three-hour conversation we actually came to agreement on all our main points.\n\nTwo weeks after the visit, as a result of Gorbachev's interventions, Yakovlev was recalled from Canada by Yuri Andropov and became Director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations of the USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow. He was succeeded by his friend Yevgeny Primakov in 1985.\n\nWhen Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1985, Yakovlev became a senior advisor, helping to shape Soviet foreign policy by advocating Soviet non-intervention in Eastern Europe, and accompanying Gorbachev on his five summit meetings with President of the United States Ronald Reagan. Domestically, he argued in favour of the reform programs that became known as glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) and played a key role in executing those policies.\n\nIn 1987, the Russian nationalist organization Pamyat sent a letter entitled \"Stop Yakovlev!\" to the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, labelling Yakovlev as the main instigator of a course of action that would lead to the 'capitulation before the imperialists'.\n\nFor decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the Nazi-Soviet Pact. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989 Yakovlev concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed his findings to the Soviet Parliament. As a result, the first multi-party elected Congress of Soviets \"passed the declaration admitting the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them\".\n\nHe was promoted to the Politburo in 1987, but by 1990 he had become the focus of attacks by hardliner communists in the party opposed to liberalisation. At the 28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in July 1990, a cynical Alexander Lebed caused uproar when he asked Yakovlev: \"Alexander Nikolaevich... How many faces have you got?\" An embarrassed Yakovlev consulted his colleagues and continued on with the proceedings, but resigned from the Politburo the day after the congress concluded. As the communists opposed to liberalization gained strength, his position became more tenuous; fiercely attacked by his former protégé Gennady Zyuganov in May 1991, he resigned from the Party two days before the August Coup in 1991. During the coup Yakovlev joined the democratic opposition against it. Following the failed coup attempt, Yakovlev blamed Gorbachev for having been naive in bringing the plotters into his inner circle saying Gorbachev was \"guilty of forming a team of traitors. Why did he surround himself with people capable of treason?\"\n\nIn his book \"Inside the Stalin Archives\" (2008), Jonathan Brent tells that in 1991, when there were Lithuanian crowds demonstrating for independence from the Soviet Union, Gorbachev consulted Yakovlev about the wisdom of an armed repression against them. Gorbachev asked, \"Should we shoot?\" Yakovlev answered that, \"if a single Soviet soldier fired a single bullet on the unarmed crowds, Soviet power would be over.\" There were bullets, however, and the USSR collapsed seven months later.\n\nIn the years following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yakovlev wrote and lectured extensively on history, politics and economics. He acted as the leader of the Russian Party of Social Democracy, which in the mid-1990s fused into United Democrats (a pro-reform alliance that was later reorganized into Union of Rightist Forces). In 2002, acting as head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, he was present at the announcement of the release of a CD detailing names and short biographies of the victims of Soviet purges. In his later life, he founded and led the International Democracy Foundation. He advocated taking responsibility for the past crimes of communism and was critical of President Putin's restrictions on democracy. \n\nIn 2000, he publicly alleged that Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, who became famous for his role in saving thousands of Hungarian Jews from the Holocaust, was shot and killed in Soviet secret police headquarters in 1947. He was called \"God's commie\" in a 2002 article for investigating crimes of the Soviet state.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The incumbent Labor Party led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke defeated the opposition Liberal–National coalition, led by Andrew Peacock.\n\nThe election was held in conjunction with two referendum questions, neither of which were carried.\n\nFuture opposition leader Alexander Downer entered parliament at this election.\n\nThe election had a long campaign and a high rate of informal voting for the House of Representatives, but decreased rate in the Senate (due to the introduction of the Group voting ticket). The election was held 18 months ahead of time, partly to bring the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate back into line following the double dissolution election of 1983.\n\nThe legislated increase in the size of the House of Representatives by 24 seats and the Senate by 12 seats came into effect at the 1984 election. Prior to 1984 the electoral commission did not undertake a full distribution of preferences for statistical purposes. The stored ballot papers for the previous election were put through this process prior to their destruction – therefore the figures from 1983 onwards show the actual result based on full distribution of preferences.\n\n\nThe results of the election surprised most analysts; the expectation had been that Bob Hawke – who had been polling a record ACNielsen approval rating of 75 percent on the eve of the election – would win by a significantly larger margin. Labor instead suffered a 2-point swing against it and had its majority cut from 25 to 16. Hawke blamed the result on the changes to Senate vote cards, which he believed confused people regarding their House of Representatives votes and contributed to the relatively high informal vote, the majority of which apparently was Labor votes. Andrew Peacock did well from a good performance in the one leaders' debate, held on 26 November 1984. This was the first televised leaders' debate in Australia.\n\n\n"}

It's a low budget, amateur version of the famous Baja 1000 and Dakar Rally. The first edition is expected to be held in January 2017. The rally will start in Los Angeles and travel 4000 kilometers on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico .\n\nThe guiding principle of the Baja 4000 is the same as the Budapest-Bamako's, \"Anyone, By Anything, In Any Way\". There are no restrictions on the vehicles or individuals that can enter, and no set routes. Participants have to complete daily stages between Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas and back. It is not a timed event. Points are awarded for completing daily stages in certain time periods. In addition there are geocaching challenges along the way for additional points. If a team does not complete a stage, they are still in the race. Cars do not have to arrive at the finish line, only participants. Teams can participate in racing or touring categories.\n\nThe rally will spend a long day in California before entering Mexico at Mexicali. Teams will drive south on the Sea Of Cortez side of the peninsula and will have to drive north on the Pacific Ocean side.\n\n\nMore than 4,000 kilometers will be covered within 10 days.\n\nTeams can enter in the competitive category where navigational points need to be reached and daily stages completed. It is a point race and not a timed event. In touring category teams travel at their own pace and there is no competition.\n\nThe Baja 4000 is primarily a charity event, that raises donations for abandoned children and orphans in Mexico through Corazon de Vida.\n\n"}

She was a finalist for the 2014 John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer and the 2014 BSFA Award for Best Short Fiction, for \"Scale-Bright\".\n\nSriduangkaew has said in an interview that she was born in Pattani Province in southern Thailand. After attending university in Bangkok, she worked in Manila, Jakarta and Hong Kong. Other sources dispute this, claiming she is born in California.\nSriduangkaew began publishing short fiction in 2012, with \"Courtship in the Country of the Machine Gods\", and established a name for herself with a string of high-profile short stories in \"Clarkesworld Magazine\" and elsewhere, which led to her nomination for the John W. Campbell Award.\n\nHer first long-form publication was the urban fantasy novella \"Scale-Bright\", published in 2014. A follow-up to her three \"Sun-Moon Cycle\" stories, it is a love story about a young woman from Hong Kong who has to rescue her sister from Heaven. Reviewing the novel for \"Tor.com\", Niall Alexander described it as \"an achievement without equal\", appreciating its \"delicately drawn characters\", \"affecting narrative\" and the author's prose skills.\n\nHer second novella, \"Winterglass\", was published in 2017. It is a science-fantasy retelling of the story of the Snow Queen. \"Publishers Weekly\"s reviewer considered that the \"promising novella\" provided \"variations on the theme of strong female characters\" but was marred by an \"uneven plot and some missed opportunities for complex worldbuilding\".\n\nMost of Sriduangkaew's work foregrounds lesbian relationships and South East Asian themes or influences.\n\nIn 2014 Sriduangkaew was revealed to have been the controversial blogger and book reviewer \"Requires Hate\" (also known as \"Requires Only That You Hate\", as well as \"Winterfox\"). Using these Internet identities, she published violently intimidating and harsh critiques, which included death and rape threats, of many writers she believed to have paid insufficient attention to racism, sexism, heteronormativity, or colonialism in their fiction. Many of her targets were themselves young, female, transgender, and/or persons of color. \n\nA blog post about Sriduangkaew's behavior by fellow writer Laura J.

On November 12 of the same year, Italy and Yugoslavia signed the Treaty of Rapallo, forming the Free State of Fiume as a consequence to an occupation of Fiume by Gabriele d'Annunzio and his troops which began with the Impresa di Fiume. D'Annunzio entered Fiume as part of his and many Italians protest for an incomplete victory after World War I, because Italy was denied some of the Eastern Adriatic lands it claimed and was promised at its entry to the war.\n\nThe resumption of Italy's premiership by the liberal Giovanni Giolitti in June 1920 signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's coup. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, under which Fiume was to be an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a government acceptable to both.\nD'Annunzio refused to accept an ultimatum forced upon him to abandon Fiume and claimed the Treaty of Rapallo as illegal. Consequently, his Regency declared war on Italy, further provoking a backlash from the Italian forces, resulting in a cannonade from the Royal Navy. General Enrico Caviglia led his troops against the city, beginning on 24 December 1920 and after just five days occupied the city.\n\nFollowing the defeat of d'Annunzio's forces, there was an election of the Constituent Assembly, giving independentists an overwhelming victory with 65% of the vote. On 5 October 1921, Riccardo Zanella became the first and only elected president of the short lived Free State of Fiume, however this was unable to end disputes over the city.\n\nSeven months later in Rome, Mussolini became prime minister, and Italy started heading towards a fascist regime. As a result, Zanella was overthrown in a fascist putsch by local fascists in March 1922, resulting in an Italian military occupation of the city. This period of diplomatic tension ended with the Treaty of Rome on 27 January 1924, which assigned Fiume to Italy and Susak along with other villages, to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "31054937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31054937", "title": "Canceled NFL games", "text": "Canceled NFL games\n\nThe following is a list of games that have been canceled by the National Football League since 1933. While canceling games was extremely common prior to this date, since that year, the NFL has only twice canceled regular season games, in both cases for labor disputes between the league and the National Football League Players Association. Seven weeks of regular season games were canceled in 1982 and one week of regular season games was canceled in 1987.\n\nPreseason contests have seen comparatively more cancellations, since the games do not count in the standings. Two of these games, the 1974 Chicago College All-Star Game and the 2011 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, were canceled because of offseason labor stoppages that were resolved prior to the start of the rest of the preseason. Three games were canceled as the result of unsafe playing fields: a 1995 NFL preseason game between the San Diego Chargers and the Houston Oilers, a 2001 preseason game between the Baltimore Ravens and the Philadelphia Eagles, and the 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game. An additional preseason game, the 2017 Texas Governor's Cup, was canceled for weather. At least one other announced game was discarded before it was officially placed on the schedule. The proposed China Bowl exhibition was to have been played in August 2007 but was postponed indefinitely before the 2007 schedule was released, with all plans for the game formally canceled before December 2008.\n\nThe league has run into other instances in which a game cannot realistically be played on its scheduled date, including weather-related rainouts and conflicts with college football or Major League Baseball over the use of shared stadiums. Unlike baseball, the NFL generally plays through even the coldest and most precipitous of weather unless such weather makes the stadium unusable or it becomes unsafe for spectators to attend the match. In such cases where a game cannot be played on its scheduled date, especially in the regular season, the league has the options of rescheduling the contest to any available day and, if the stadium cannot be used, relocating the contest to the opponent’s stadium or a neutral site (usually another nearby NFL stadium or a suitably sized modern college football venue). To date, such measures have not been necessary for any individual game in the playoffs.\n\nCanceling games was far more common in the 1920s and early 1930s, in the founding years of the league. When a team did not want to play a game, they could cancel without any punishment or penalty. Several years after league schedules were standardized in 1933, cancellations were effectively banned, and teams would have to forfeit the game or postpone if a cancellation was due to issues outside the team's control. There have been no forfeits in the league's history; a 1921 game between the Rochester Jeffersons and the Washington Senators is occasionally listed as a forfeit, but because of the lax cancellation rules of the time and uncertainty over which team (if either) was at fault for the game not being played, the game is listed in modern records as a cancellation. The last unpunished cancellation of a regular season NFL game is believed to have been a November 17, 1935 contest between the Boston Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles, which was canceled for severe rain and snow.\n\nSeveral games were removed from the schedules of the NFL teams of the early 1940s, but because the issues (namely, World War II, the loss of marquee talent to the war effort, and restrictions on resource usage) were already foreseen by the start of the 1942 season, the league was able to issue shortened schedules from the start without having to cancel already scheduled contests.\n\nThe 1974 College All-Star Game, an exhibition game that pitted the most recent Super Bowl champion (Miami Dolphins) against a team composed entirely of rookies, was canceled as a result of a players’ strike. The strike was resolved before any further games were canceled; the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game, along with the rest of the 1974 NFL season, went on as scheduled, although at least one game was held with the Denver Broncos using a squad of rookie replacement players.\n\nIn 1982, players began a 57-day strike following the completion of Week 2 of the regular season. As a result of the impasse, games were simply canceled until a settlement was reached (ultimately, Weeks 3 to 9). Upon reaching that settlement, the NFL announced that Weeks 11 to 16 would be played as scheduled, and the games originally scheduled for Week 3 of the season would be played following the completion of the resumed regular season as a new Week 17, with the playoffs pushed back one week. Later, the NFL decided to use the final week 17 to hold various intra-division games from cancelled Weeks 3 to 9 instead of merely playing the Week 3 games. This was done to increase attendance and to allow some teams to balance out home and away games, to the extent possible (either five home and four away, or four home and five away). Because the 1982 shortened season would include only nine regular season contests for each team, the NFL announced that the three divisions in each of the two conferences would be eliminated for the purpose of determining playoff qualifications, and the regular season would be followed by an expansion of the playoffs from 10 to 16 teams. With this, each conference had 14 teams competing for 8 playoff spots, with division standings being disregarded in favor of overall conference standings. Each of the first three rounds of the playoffs was pushed back one week in order to make room for the new week 17, which was originally scheduled as the Wild Card weekend. This was possible because there was an idle week between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl and Pro Bowl were held as originally scheduled.\n\nNote: Some of the games originally scheduled for Weeks 3 to 9, listed below, were rescheduled to a new, final Week 17.\n\nIn order to ensure maximal attendance, and to balance out home and away games for each team, to the extent possible (either five home and four away, or four home and five away), the NFL made 12 of the 14 games in the final week of the rescheduled season (Week 17) select intra-division games that were picked from cancelled Weeks 3 to 10, instead of merely playing out Week 3 games, as had originally been planned. This was the maximum number mathematically possible, since four of the six divisions at that time had an odd number of teams (the two games that were not intra-division were New York Jets at Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys at Minnesota Vikings). The New York Giants at Philadelphia Eagles game originally scheduled for Week 7 on Monday was moved to Sunday, while the Dallas Cowboys at Minnesota Vikings game originally scheduled for Week 3 on Sunday was moved to Monday.\n\nIn 1987, the players went on strike for a second time in-season, again following the second week of the campaign. However, unlike 1982, the owners took the bold step of using replacement players. After missing just one week of action, the NFL resumed with replacement players for Week 4. By the time Week 6 had rolled around, enough players had crossed the picket lines and forced an agreement to let the regular players play again. The canceled games of Week 3 were not made up, and the league counted the three weeks of game results featuring the replacement players as regular season games toward each team's final standings. By Week 7, the teams had all players back in action, with all teams completing a 15-game schedule. Also unlike 1982, there was no change to the playoff format that season.\n\nAn August 19, 1995 preseason game between the San Diego Chargers and the Houston Oilers was the first game in NFL history to be canceled before kickoff after an NFL official determined that the Astrodome’s artificial turf endangered the players.\n\nAn August 13, 2001 preseason game between the Ravens and the Eagles was canceled because of an unplayable playing surface at Veterans Stadium. This was scheduled to be the first football game played at the stadium after a new artificial surface, NexTurf, was installed. Because the multi-purpose stadium was shared by both the Eagles and the Philadelphia Phillies baseball team, this surface (and the previous artificial turf installations before it) included cutouts that covered up the dirt infield around the bases. After examining the turf, Ravens coach Brian Billick refused to let the Ravens take the field for warm-ups when he discovered a trench around the area where third base was covered up by one of the cutouts. City crews unsuccessfully tried to fix the problem, forcing the game to be canceled. Later, players from both teams reported that they sank into the turf in locations near the infield cutouts. Team president Joe Banner was irate after the game, calling the stadium's conditions \"absolutely unacceptable\" and \"an embarrassment to the city of Philadelphia.\" City officials, however, promised that the stadium would be suitable for play when the regular season started. The Eagles would later move into Lincoln Financial Field in 2003, and the Phillies would move into its own separate ballpark, Citizens Bank Park, in 2004.\n\nIn the wake of the September 11 attacks, the NFL postponed its Week 2 games of the 2001 season, originally scheduled for September 16 and 17, until the end of the regular season. All playoff games following the 2001 regular season, including Super Bowl XXXVI and the 2002 Pro Bowl, were similarly rescheduled one week later.\n\nThis was in contrast during the wake of the John F. Kennedy assassination in 1963 when the NFL went ahead and played its full slate of games that week, a decision that then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle would later regret, though he also stated that Pierre Salinger, Kennedy’s press secretary, had urged him to allow the games to be played. Meanwhile, the American Football League canceled week 12 of its 1963 season and later rescheduled those games.\n\nOn July 22, 2011, the NFL announced that that year’s Pro Football Hall of Fame Game originally set for August 7 of that year between Chicago and St. Louis had been canceled, for an ongoing lockout that had been in place since March of that year. The league approved a new collective bargaining agreement on July 21, but at the same time announced the cancellation of the game, citing the fact that the players would not have enough time in training camp to prepare before the game.\n\nThe NFL also had contingency plans to cancel and/or postpone regular season games (up to eight) if a labor agreement could not be reached by the start of the regular season. The league did not have to implement the plans, since the players association agreed to terms with the NFL shortly before the start of the season proper on July 25, ending the lockout.\n\nThe 2016 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game was canceled at the last minute for poor playing conditions on the newly installed FieldTurf that had been placed at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in the off-season. Mike Silver of NFL.com reported that on the morning of game day, the logos at midfield and the end zones had been painted using paint which was not intended for use on artificial turf. When it was apparent the paint wasn't drying fast enough, the field was heated to speed up the drying process, but this caused the turf's rubber to melt. These issues led to unfavorable play conditions. The affected areas were described as being slick and \"like cement,\" making it impossible to get decent footing. Stadium officials attempted to address this by applying a solvent, reportedly paint thinner, to the turf. A Packers employee noticed a label warning that this substance could result in burns when exposed to skin, and alerted others to the discovery. When officially cancelling the game, both the league and the Players Association cited safety concerns.\n\nBoth teams were told at 6:40 p.m.—an hour and 20 minutes before kickoff—that the game was going to be canceled. However, fans in the stadium only learned of the pending cancellation via social media. No official announcement was made until just before the scheduled 8 p.m. kickoff.\n\nThe 2017 Governor's Cup, an annual preseason matchup between Texas’s two NFL franchises, the Dallas Cowboys and Houston Texans, was canceled by the effects of Hurricane Harvey. The game, originally scheduled for August 31 in Houston, was initially moved to Dallas, as Houston was severely flooded as the result of the rains from Harvey and the team had temporarily relocated to Dallas until the storm passed. The Texans opted instead to cancel the game to allow the team more time to relocate back to Houston.\n\nIn the modern era, severe weather or natural disasters have affected some games, but only the aforementioned case of Hurricane Harvey has a game been canceled outright. Others were either switched to a different location, or to a different date in the schedule.\n\nThe 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake damaged Candlestick Park, forcing the San Francisco 49ers to play their next home game on October 22 against the New England Patriots at Stanford University’s Stanford Stadium.\n\nIn 1992, Hurricane Andrew forced the September 6 opening-day game between the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins at Joe Robbie Stadium to be rescheduled to October 18, when both teams originally had a bye week.\n\nIn the wake of the October 25, 2003 Cedar Fire, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist in the disaster relief process. Because of the soot and particulate matter in the air from the fire two days earlier, the NFL was forced to move the Monday Night Football game on October 27 between the San Diego Chargers and Miami Dolphins to Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nIn 2004, the Cincinnati Bengals at Tampa Bay Buccaneers preseason game, scheduled for Saturday, August 14, was rescheduled to Monday, August 16, because of Hurricane Charley.\n\nIn 2004, the Tennessee Titans at Miami Dolphins opening-day game, scheduled for Sunday, September 12 at 1 PM ET, was rescheduled to Saturday, September 11 at 1 PM ET because of Hurricane Ivan,and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Miami Dolphins game scheduled for Sunday, September 26, at 1 PM ET was moved to 8:30 PM ET because of Hurricane Jeanne. The latter game would become notable as the first NFL start of Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.\n\nHurricane Katrina in 2005 damaged the Louisiana Superdome. The NFL decided that the New Orleans Saints' first regularly scheduled home game against the New York Giants be played in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, with the Saints the home team in name only. For the rest of the season, the Saints home games were split between the Alamodome in San Antonio and Louisiana State University’s Tiger Stadium.\n\nIn 2005, the NFL moved up the Kansas City Chiefs at Miami Dolphins game from Sunday, October 23 at 1 PM ET to Friday, October 21 at 7 PM ET because of Hurricane Wilma. The NFL received permission to play the game on a Friday, as the team’s antitrust exemption normally forbids it to televise games on Fridays to protect high school football. It also forced the Chiefs to travel to Miami on the day of the game, a violation of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement with the National Football League Players Association which requires a visiting team to arrive in the host city no later than 24 hours prior to kickoff. \n\nHurricane Ike forced several changes to the 2008 schedule. The Houston Texans’ Week 2 home game against the Baltimore Ravens was first postponed to Monday, September 15, before Ike made landfall; damage to Reliant Stadium forced a further postponement, to Week 10, on Sunday, November 9, giving the Texans and the Ravens their bye weeks in Week 2. Furthermore, to accommodate this move, the Texans’ home game against the Cincinnati Bengals was moved forward from November 9 to Sunday, October 26, pushing the Bengals’ bye week from Week 8 to Week 10.\n\nIn 2010, a severe storm in Minnesota deposited over of snow on the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, which caused the venue’s inflatable roof (a form of dome now mostly obsolete for major sports) to collapse about 24 hours later, early in the morning of December 12. The Minnesota Vikings had been scheduled to host the New York Giants that afternoon. Prior to the collapse, the game had already been postponed to Monday night, December 13, over concerns of stadium officials. The game was relocated to Ford Field in Detroit, still played Monday night. The game would be notable as the ending of Brett Favre’s NFL-record 297 consecutive starts streak. The Vikings’ December 20 game against Chicago was moved to TCF Bank Stadium on the University of Minnesota campus. The collapse affected no further NFL games, as the rest of the Vikings’ 2010 season consisted of road games, and the team had already been eliminated from playoff contention. The roof collapse was a factor in the Metrodome being demolished and replaced with hard-roofed U.S. Bank Stadium a few years later.\n\nOn December 26, 2010, a \"Sunday Night Football\" game between the Minnesota Vikings and Philadelphia Eagles in Philadelphia was postponed to Tuesday, December 28, by a severe snowstorm. It was the first Tuesday NFL game in 64 years.\n\nIn 2014, a severe snowstorm that hit the Buffalo area forced a Jets–Bills game, originally scheduled for November 23, to be moved to Detroit’s indoor Ford Field on November 24.\n\nHurricane Irma prompted the postponement of a game between the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, originally scheduled for September 10, 2017, to November 19; both teams coincidentally were scheduled for the same bye week, leaving the latter date available for the game to be made up.\n\nThere have also been rare occasions in which games had to be pushed back one night because of a last-minute scheduling conflict in the facility of those games, most notably when an NFL team has shared a home stadium with a team from Major League Baseball and the baseball team has needed the building for a post-season game. This was a frequent occurrence when there were several shared stadiums across the country, but since 2012 only one such venue remains: Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, home of the NFL Raiders and the MLB Athletics; this arrangement will end by 2020 when the Raiders move to a purpose-built stadium in Las Vegas.\n\nAlthough NFL/MLB-shared stadiums are now rare instead of the norm, there are several current NFL stadiums that share the same parking lots and other ancillary facilities with an adjacent MLB ballpark, thus also preventing both teams from playing simultaneously. (This also occurs when two NFL franchises in different cities share a common geographic area, namely the Oakland Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. The cities and the NFL do not want the teams playing home games on the same day, for Bay Area traffic concerns.)\n\nOn October 12, 1964, the St. Louis Cardinals were forced to move their scheduled home game against the Baltimore Colts to Memorial Stadium, since St. Louis' Busch Stadium I was being used for the World Series by the baseball team also called the St. Louis Cardinals. Even though game five of the World Series was played that day at Yankee Stadium, the football Cardinals could not use the stadium until the baseball team, the stadium's owner, had completed its season.\n\nThe Atlanta Falcons were forced to move their October 5, 1969 home game vs. the Colts from Atlanta Stadium to Grant Field at Georgia Tech because the Atlanta Braves hosted the New York Mets in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series. The same day, the Minnesota Vikings moved their home game vs. the Green Bay Packers from Metropolitan Stadium to Memorial Stadium at the University of Minnesota because of an American League Championship Series game between the Minnesota Twins and the Baltimore Orioles. One week later, the Philadelphia Eagles’ game in Baltimore against the Colts was pushed from Sunday, October 12, to Monday night, October 13, to accommodate Game 2 of the World Series between the Orioles and the New York Mets. The following week, the World Series prompted the American Football League to move the game at Shea Stadium between the Houston Oilers and New York Jets from Sunday, October 19, to Monday night, October 20. \n\nThe 1973 New York Jets faced the same situation as the 1964 Cardinals. The New York Mets unexpectedly reached the World Series, and under the terms of the Jets’ lease at Shea Stadium in place at the time, there could be no football games at the stadium in Queens until the Mets’ season was complete. Thus, the Jets were forced to move their October 21 game vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers from Shea to Three Rivers Stadium, even though the final game of the Series at Shea was played October 18 (games six and seven were played at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, home of the Oakland Athletics).\n\nIn 1979, the Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins switched the dates of their two games with the Eagles hosting the Redskins on October 7th (instead of October 21st) and the Redskins hosting the Eagles on October 21st (instead of October 7th). This was due to the visit of Pope John Paul II to Washington on October 7th. A similar situation happened to the Eagles in 1983 where they were forced to switch the dates of their games with the Dallas Cowboys because the Phillies were playing the 1983 World Series. The Eagles were originally scheduled to play the Cowboys at Veterans Stadium on October 16, 1983; however this game conflicted with Game 5 of the World Series. The game was moved to Texas Stadium and the November 6th game was moved to Veterans Stadium.\n\nIn 1987, Game 5 of the National League Championship Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the San Francisco Giants was held at Candlestick Park, prompting the 49ers and Falcons to switch home dates for their two games that season; the 49ers visited Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium on October 11, and the Falcons went to San Francisco on December 20. The October 11 game in Atlanta drew only 8,684, the lowest ever for a Falcons home game up to that point; the game was played during the player strike, so replacement players were used.\n\nIn 1987, the Sunday, October 18 World Series Game 2 between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Minnesota Twins led to the Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers to switch home dates for their two games that season.\n\nIn 1987, the next week, the Sunday, October 25 World Series Game 7 between the St. Louis Cardinals and Minnesota Twins led the NFL to reschedule the Denver Broncos at Minnesota Vikings) game to the following Monday night, October 26.\n\nIn 1989, the Sunday, October 8 New Orleans Saints and San Francisco 49ers switched home dates (October 8 originally in San Francisco and November 6 originally in New Orleans) to accommodate the MLB's National League Championship Series Chicago Cubs at San Francisco Giants games on October 7, 8, and 9. \n\nIn 1997, the Sunday, October 26 Cleveland Indians at Florida Marlins World Series game caused the NFL to reschedule the Chicago Bears at Miami Dolphins game for the following Monday night, October 27.\n\nIn 2001, a potential Oakland Athletics baseball playoff game forced the Oakland Raiders to play their contest against the Dallas Cowboys two weeks in advance to avoid a possible conflict, when both clubs originally had their bye week (as it turned out, the Athletics ended up getting eliminated a few days before the originally scheduled date of the Cowboys–Raiders game).\n\nIn 2009, the New York Giants–Philadelphia Eagles game at Lincoln Financial Field was moved from 4:15 pm to 1:00 pm to accommodate the Philadelphia Phillies hosting Game 4 of the 2009 World Series at adjacent Citizens Bank Park.\n\nIn 2013, the Oakland Athletics playing in the ALDS against the Detroit Tigers forced the Oakland Raiders to postpone their originally scheduled Sunday afternoon game against the San Diego Chargers from 4:25 pm Eastern/1:25 pm Pacific to a late-night start time of 11:35 Eastern/8:35 Pacific.\n\nThe opening game of the 2013 season, which would traditionally have been hosted by the Baltimore Ravens as defending Super Bowl XLVII champions, was instead a Ravens road game at the Denver Broncos because of a conflict with a Baltimore Orioles home game at Oriole Park at Camden Yards and insufficient parking for both venues.\n"}

{"id": "2550336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2550336", "title": "Cattle prod", "text": "Cattle prod\n\nA cattle prod, also called a stock prod, is a handheld device commonly used to make cattle or other livestock move by striking or poking them. An electric cattle prod is a stick with electrodes on the end which is used to make cattle move through a relatively high-voltage, low-current electric shock. The electric cattle prod is said to have been invented by Texas cattle baron Robert J. Kleberg, Jr. of the King Ranch around 1930, although versions were sold as early as 1917.\n\nRanchers and farmers typically use the term \"cattle prods\" mainly to refer to simple non-electrified fiberglass or metal goads used to physically encourage cattle into motion; the majority of people living outside of rural areas use the term 'cattle prod' exclusively for the electrified variant. Most ranchers and farmers refer to electric cattle prods as \"hotshots\" (this is an example of a genericized trademark; one of the most prominent brands of electric prod is Hot-Shot).\n\nIn an electric cattle prod, which is the precursor to the modern day stun gun, dual surface electrodes produce a very high voltage/very low current electric arc between them, which, when pressed against conductive skin, produces a painful but superficial electric shock which stimulates the target to cease their current activity and move in the direction opposite the source of the pain. With higher current, the cattle prod is the equivalent of a stun gun and functions exactly the same way. Cattle prods are the precursor to direct contact electric stun guns used against humans, and their basic operating principles are the same. The major differences are primarily in the matter of size and power: cattle prods tend to have a higher electric current and a longer handle than stun guns, which is helpful when dealing with very large, powerful animals.\n\nRegular cattle prods can actually be anything from a baton (goad) or piece of pipe properly wired, to a manufactured fiberglass rod with a rubber handle or even a rectangular-shaped device similar to today's stun guns, which also feature batons. Most prods use two metal tips, but some are rubberized for herding stubborn animals. A Wiffleball bat is also often used as an effective prod because the hollow plastic bat makes a sharp ringing sound when slapped against the skin.\n\nUnlike hotshots, which produce high voltage and can be effective on humans, regular cattle prods used on animals are simply used to tap, strike, or poke an animal (usually on the flanks), depending on how stubborn the animal is. Sometimes, a prod can be used as a sort of \"extended fence\", allowing one to simply intimidate skittish animals away from open gates or downed fences without having to touch them.\n\nA hotshot is typically cylindrical, and can carry an open electric current at the \"shock end\" when activated. The electric current at the shock end runs through two metal electrodes. Anything that touches the electric current receives a high-voltage low-current shock, not strong enough to kill a human or a large animal such as a cow or sheep from short-term exposure, but strong enough to cause significant pain.\n\nThe electric cattle prod is designed to inflict a painful shock to cattle, and thus \"prod\" them along; the pain stimulates movement. Some higher-voltage prods can interfere with radio and CB radio reception when activated.\n\nThere are various designs of electric cattle prods. Their shape is often subject to guidelines of what can easily be used and handled. They range in length from six inches (usually of a more encased rectangular prism design like a stun gun), to up to six feet. As the precursor of stun guns, cattle prods also have a wide range of voltage with enough current to operate in the same manner as a stun gun does against humans. A stun gun is nothing more than a beefed up cattle prod and both can be used on humans or animals by design. Whether it is called a cattle prod or a stun gun, both units are shaped for easy carry and function in the same manner against animals or humans. Most are simple designs powered by 9-volt or a combination of other types of batteries. Anything out of that range is usually too heavy and unwieldy for practical use. Another typical design is a box containing a large battery (or battery pack) at the handle end and wires embedded in a fibreglass rod, ending with two electrodes in a rubber tip. This design is well-suited for use as a regular cattle prod.\n\nThe use of electric cattle prods has been debated by many people. Organizations such as PETA contend that the use of cattle prods is as much mentally harmful as it is physically. Most farmers contend that the short shock is minutely felt, and soon forgotten.\n\nCattle prods today are designed with a high range of voltages and currents. If more powerful prods are applied continuously to the skin, the current eventually causes heating, searing, burning, and scarring of skin at the contact point. Electric prods have found favour with torturers.\n\nPrior to the development of stun batons and the taser, electric cattle prods were also used on people in varying degrees. Their first common usage on people occurred during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s; prods were first adopted by police officers in Alabama to use on protesters and agencies elsewhere followed; Hotshot later developed an electric police baton.\n\nThe picana is an electric prod based originally on the cattle prod but designed specifically for human torture. It works at very high voltage and low current so as to maximize pain and minimize the physical marks left on the victim. Among its advantages over other torture devices is that it is portable, easy to use, and allows the torturer to localize the electric shocks to the most sensitive places on the body, where they cause intense pain that can be repeated many times.\n\nElectric prods have been used for the control of adverse self-injuring behavior in mentally handicapped people. This use is regarded by some advocates to be more effective than drugs since the experience of a shock is very short and temporary while using a drug may have long-lasting sedative effects.\n\nOn August 14, 2013 in Lakewood Township, New Jersey, Mendel Epstein told two undercover FBI agents that he used a cattle prod to coerce Jewish husbands to grant religious divorces to their wives, leading the press to nickname him \"The Prodfather\". He was convicted of conspiring to commit kidnapping, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. This aspect of the cattle prod has been touted as an advantage for its use in torture.\n\nCattle can be difficult to move and direct for a variety of reasons. Prods can be useful for moving stubborn or aggressive animals, but often cattle will not move forward when they are fearful of something they see, hear, or smell. Removal of these distractions or hiding them, such as with solid wall partitions, can greatly reduce animal handling problems, however, cattle handlers cannot completely overcome the animal's decision not to move forward.\n\nBy studying the psychology of the animals and redesigning the working environment it is possible to handle the animals without the need for brute force and causing pain and suffering to the animal in many, but not all, cases. Significant work in this regard has been done by Colorado State University professor Temple Grandin to study how cattle perceive the environment around them and to design better livestock slaughterhouse handling systems that do not induce fear into the animal.\n\nIn the Martin Scorsese film \"Casino\", a cheating gambler is shocked with a cattle prod by a security guard, which is passed off as a heart attack. As an example of \"cheater's justice,\" he is threatened with a circular saw and has his fingers broken with a hammer.\n\nIn \"Fargo\", a television crime series based on the film of the same name, a cattle prod is used on numerous occasions as a weapon against humans in season 2.\n\nIn \"Pretty Little Liars\", a popular television series, a cattle prod was used to torture one of the leading characters Hanna Marin.\nIn Ridley Scott's 1979 horror film \"Alien\", Ellen Ripley and her crew attempt to capture an escaped Xenomorph with the help of a cattle prod.\n\nIn Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" and the 2017 Hulu TV series adaptation, cattle prods are used by the Aunts to control the Handmaids, a class of fertile women who serve as surrogates for the ruling Commanders.\n\nIn \"Bottom\", a British television sitcom, in Season 3 Episode 2 (\"Terror\"), a homemade cattle prod device is used to convince people to hand over money during Halloween.\n\nCattle prods feature as usable weapons in the video games Fallout, Fallout 2 and , the latter themed around agricultural society in the American Southwest\n\nIn the 2017 film \"The Shape of Water\", a cattle prod features prominently. It is the weapon of choice used by the primary antagonist, Col. Strickland, who carries it with him constantly. The head of a secret government program that captures and studies the Amphibian Man, Strickland uses the cattle prod to torture both him and a Soviet spy who infiltrates the program. Strickland introduces the cattle prod to the protagonists, saying \"That lovely dingus right there is an Alabama howdy-do. Molded grip handle, low-current high-voltage electric shock cattle prod\".\n"}
{"id": "26022846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26022846", "title": "Clybourne Park", "text": "Clybourne Park\n\nClybourne Park is a 2010 play by Bruce Norris written as a spin-off to Lorraine Hansberry's play \"A Raisin in the Sun\" (1959). It portrays fictional events set before and after the Hansberry play, and is loosely based on historical events that took place in the city of Chicago. It premiered in February 2010 at Playwrights Horizons in New York. The play received its UK premiere at the Royal Court Theatre in London in a production directed by Dominic Cooke. The play received its Chicago premiere at Steppenwolf Theatre Company in a production directed by Steppenwolf ensemble member Amy Morton. As described by \"The Washington Post\", the play \"applies a modern twist to the issues of race and housing and aspirations for a better life.\" \"Clybourne Park\" was awarded the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the 2012 Tony Award for Best Play.\n\nGrieving parents Bev and Russ are planning to sell their home in the white middle-class Chicago neighborhood of Clybourne Park. They receive a visit from their local clergyman, Jim, as well as their neighbor Karl and his deaf, pregnant wife Betsy. Karl informs them that the family buying their house is black, and pleads with Russ to back out of the deal, for fear that falling area property values will drive the Lindners' neighbors away and isolate them if black residents move in. It becomes apparent that the black family moving in are the Youngers, the protagonists of \"A Raisin in the Sun\", and the neighbor is Karl Lindner, the minor character from that play who attempted to bribe the Youngers into abandoning their plans to move into the neighborhood. The action is taking place approximately an hour following Karl Lindner's departure from the Youngers' Hamilton Park residence, where they have rejected his bribery attempt. As arguments ensue about the potential problems of integrating the neighborhood, both couples awkwardly call on Russ and Bev's black housekeeper and her husband, Francine and Albert, to express their opposing views. Russ finally snaps and throws everyone out of the house, saying he no longer cares about his neighbors after their community's shunning his son Kenneth when he returned home from the Korean War, which contributed to Kenneth's suicide, which occurred inside the house.\n\nSet in the same home as Act I, the same actors reappear playing different characters. In the intervening fifty years, Clybourne Park has become an all-black neighborhood, which is now gentrifying. A white couple, Steve and Lindsay (played by the same actors who played Karl and Betsy in Act I), are seeking to buy, raze and rebuild the house at a larger scale, and are being forced to negotiate local housing regulations with a black couple, Kevin and Lena (played by the same actors as Francine and Albert), who represent the housing board. Lena is related to the Younger family (and named after matriarch Lena Younger), and is unwilling to have the house torn down. Steve and Lindsay's lawyer, Kathy (played by Bev) is revealed to be the daughter of Karl and his deaf wife, Betsy, and mentions that her family moved out of the neighborhood around the time of her birth. A cordial discussion of housing codes soon degenerates into one of racial issues, instigated by a concerned Steve, who feels that the mask of \"political correctness\" is allowing for a more subtle kind of prejudice against them. The alternating disgust and dismissal that follows reveals resentments from both parties, and several awkward comments lead to Steve being goaded into telling a racist, homophobic joke that offends both Kevin and the other lawyer, Tom (played by Jim), who is gay. The discussion is interrupted several times by Dan (played by Russ), a workman who has found Kenneth's army trunk buried in the back yard. As fighting erupts and the two couples turn on each other and themselves, Dan opens the trunk and finds Kenneth's suicide note.\n\nIn a short coda, we see Bev back in 1957, catching her son awake late at night, dressed in his army uniform. He claims to be dressing for a job interview, though it is clear that he is in the act of writing his suicide note. Leaving him to tend to the house, Bev observes that \"I really believe things are about to change for the better.\"\n\nHansberry's parents bought a house in the white neighborhood of Washington Park, an action that resulted in a legal case (\"Hansberry v. Lee\", 311 U.S. 32 [1940]). The Hansberry family home, a red brick three-floor at 6140 S. Rhodes, which they bought in 1937, is up for landmark status before the Chicago City Council's Committee on Historical Landmarks Preservation.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at Playwrights Horizons on February 21, 2010, before closing on March 21, 2010. Directed by Pam MacKinnon, the cast featured Frank Wood, Annie Parisse, Jeremy Shamos, Crystal A. Dickinson, Brendan Griffin, Damon Gupton, and Christina Kirk, \n\nThe play premiered in the UK in August 2010 at the Royal Court Theatre in London directed by Dominic Cooke, artistic director of the theatre, and starring Sophie Thompson, Martin Freeman, Lorna Brown, Sarah Goldberg, Michael Goldsmith, Lucian Msamati, Sam Spruell and Steffan Rhodri. It transferred to Wyndham's Theatre in the West End with most of the original cast, with the exceptions of Martin Freeman, who was replaced by Stephen Campbell Moore; and Steffan Rhodri, who was replaced by Stuart McQuarrie.\n\nEven before the play premiered on Broadway, it had several notable productions in regional theatres: The Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company (Washington D.C.) staged it in March, 2010, with artistic director Howard Shalwitz directing. The Caldwell Theatre Company (Boca Raton, Florida) staged it in January 2011, with Clive Cholerton directing and starring Gregg Weiner, Karen Stephens, Brian D. Coats, Kenneth Kay, Patti Gardner, Cliff Burgess, and Margery Lowe. The play's Chicago premiere took place in September 2011 at Steppenwolf Theatre Company, directed by Steppenwolf ensemble member Amy Morton and featuring ensemble member James Vincent Meredith along with Karen Aldridge, Cliff Chamberlain, Stephanie Childers, Kirsten Fitzgerald, John Judd, and Brendan Marshall-Rashid; the production closed in November 2011.\n\nIn October/November 2011, the play was in residence with the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, Rhode Island, with Brian Mertes directing and starring Mauro Hantman, Rachael Warren, Mia Ellis, Anne Scurria, Timothy Crowe, Tommy Dickie, and Joe Wilson Jr. From January to March 2012, the play ran at Arden Theatre Company in Old City, Philadelphia, directed by Ed Sobel and starring David Ingram, Julia Gibson, Erika Rose, Steve Pacek, Josh Tower, Ian Merrill Peakes, and Maggie Lakis. \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\" claimed, \"A remarkably skillful cast directed by Edward Sobel creates characters that flirt with stereotypes, but become real and believable...This is a bitter satire that makes us laugh while it indicts us.\"\n\nThe play opened on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre on April 19, 2012 (in previews starting March 26, 2012) for a 16-week limited engagement. The Off-Broadway cast reprised their roles. The play was nominated for several Tony Awards, and won the one for Best Play.\n\nIn 2013, the play was staged at the Guthrie Theater (May to June 2013), in rotating repertory with \"A Raisin in the Sun\" at the Dallas Theater Center, and in rotating repertory with Kwame Kwei-Armah's \"Beneatha's Place\" at Center Stage in Baltimore.\n\nThe play had several productions in 2014: in January at the Grand Rapids Civic Theatre, in February 2014, at the Wichita Center for the Arts in Wichita, Kansas, and in September as the season opener for the Hippodrome State Theatre in Gainesville, Florida. Also, the play's Australian premiere took place in March at the Ensemble Theatre in Sydney; the run was scheduled for five weeks, but sold out before opening night and was subsequently extended at another location.\n\n\n\n"}

The global event has been celebrated since 2000 in various parts of the world, where \"edible books\" are created, displayed, and small events are held. The creations are photographed and then consumed. Regular contributors to the site are groups from Australia, Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Russia, and Hong Kong. The event was initiated by Judith A. Hoffberg and Béatrice Coron in 2000.\nThe official website <nowiki>Books2Eat.com</nowiki> says that the International Edible Book Festival is held to commemorate \"the birthday of French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755–1826), noted for his book \"Physiologie du goût\", a witty meditation on food\", though April Fools' Day is also related as \"the perfect day to eat your words and play with them as the 'books' are consumed on the day of the event\". (cf. \"The Phantom Tollbooth\", as regards eating one's words.)\n\nThe participation rules per a related site are:\n\nIn 2005, the festival was a joint initiative of forum book art and the Museum of Work, Hamburg, where pastry chefs made edible books. The \"book art\" was displayed, photographed, and then eaten. In 2005, the event was celebrated in Los Angeles, too, at the Los Angeles Book Arts Center as the \"Annual International Edible Book High/Low Tea\" on April 2, where artists were encouraged to create and consume tomes. A 2006 Indianapolis Monthly described the Indianapolis festival as a \"quirky event\" held on April Fools' Day, \"celebrating both food and literature.\" Participants created foods resembling literary titles.\n\nLoganberry Books in Shaker Heights, Ohio has held an edible books festival every April since 2004 In 2013, awards were given for Most Literary, Most Appetizing, Most Book-like, and Most Creative.\n\nA University of Florida library holds the event as the Edible Book Contest in April, in connection with National Library Week. There are two rules for the contest: Entries should be edible, and they must somehow relate to a book. Besides edible books, other entries include \"edible book trucks\" and \"edible bookmarks\". The event kicks off with viewing of the entries, each of which has an information card describing the book title, author, and creator of the book art. The \"books\" are judged by a panel of judges and by public voting. Awards are given in categories like: Most Creative, Least Edible, Best Overall Fiction, Best Overall Non-Fiction, and Best Children's Book. In 2010, the event is planned to be held on April 15 and the award categories are: Best Overall Entry, Best Book Theme, Best Pun, Best Adult Book, and Best Children's Book.\nPerkins Library at Hastings College in Nebraska (US) celebrated Banned Books Week 2008 by holding an edible book contest. The event invited guests to consume cooked dishes and baked goods that resembled covers of banned books or reflected their content. A reporter sums up the aptly named event: \"Our celebration took Sir Francis Bacon's famous words quite literally: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and the other few to be chewed and digested.'\"\n\nIn 2011, the British newspaper \"Metro\" ran a story that they would begin producing the newspaper on an edible \"Sweet tasting paper\" claiming to bring customers \"news in the best possible taste\". The newspaper later clarified this was nothing more than an April Fools' joke.\n\n"}
{"id": "37191518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37191518", "title": "Elder Pastitsios", "text": "Elder Pastitsios\n\nElder Pastitsios (, \"Géron/Gérontas Pastítsios\") is a satirical figure of a fictitious monk who first appeared in a Facebook page. The satire is mostly based on the famous Greek Orthodox monk Elder Paisios, with his name and face substituted by pastitsio — a local pasta and béchamel sauce dish, thus combining Greek Orthodox and Pastafarian imagery. The page ran for about a year until it was closed down after the arrest of its creator for blasphemy on . The case, which started as a Facebook flame, reached the Greek Parliament twice and created a strong local as well as international political impact.\n\nThe main satire of the page revolved around Elder Paisios (d. 1994), a monk from Holy Mountain, famous for his spiritual teachings. Much has been written about his person and his prophecies concerning the End times, the upbringing of children, couples' relationships, even the diet Paisios supposedly followed. High-ranking priests as well as believers have proposed that the Elder should be recognised as a Saint by the Orthodox Church. The page criticised, among others, the exploitation of Paisios by the press and by Orthodox websites that propagate the alleged prophecies and teachings of the charismatic Elder (according to his followers he had predicted the fall of the Soviet Union and the recent Greek crisis).\n\nThe \"Elder Pastitsios\" page satirised and criticised (with no reported profanity according to the media), various religious aspects in Greece such as infant baptism, religious education in schools and the lack of separation between church and state; these were presented through the eyes of the Pastafarian satirical pseudo-religion \"Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", which has been used to lampoon the teaching of creationism in schools.\n\nThe page created a hoax about a posthumous miracle by Elder Paisios which was submitted to various Orthodox, conservative and far-right blogs in July. The story was based on several existing accounts that were already circulating online and involved the miraculous recovery of a teenager who supposedly woke from a coma after his mother placed a talisman with dirt from Elder Paisios’ grave under his pillow.\n\nThe story reached 93,800 Google search results and was reproduced both online and in print, and even became a cover story on the far-right newspaper \"Eleftheri Ora\". The 27-year-old page creator would later state that he did this to expose the gullibility of the faithful, and also to show the poor fact-checking done among the religious and conservative blogosphere.\n\nFour days before the page creator's arrest, MP Christos Pappas from the far-right Golden Dawn party had brought the page to the attention of the Minister of Justice by raising a question to the Greek Parliament on September 17. The police claimed they had already concluded their investigation two days before the question was raised in parliament due to thousands of complaints by Orthodox believers worldwide.\n\nOn 21 September, the 27-year-old man was arrested in Greece on charges of malicious blasphemy and offense of religion for the creation of a satirical Facebook page called \"Elder Pastitsios\". Blasphemy in Greece carries a fine of up to 3,000 €, and up to 2 years imprisonment.\n\nThe news of the arrest created a worldwide interest in the case with the Twitter hashtag #FreeGeronPastitsios becoming a global trending topic and a relevant petition by the Humanist Union of Greece has received over 10,000 signatures so far on Change.org.\n\nIn a web television interview after his arrest, the page owner said that the evidence that led the e-crimes bureau of the Greek police to him were all provided by Facebook. Pan-Euro communications manager of Facebook, Iain Mackenzie wrote that Facebook disclosed basic subscriber information in response to a Greek court order without knowing what type of charges the user was subject to. According to article 19 of the Greek Constitution, limiting of confidentiality of communications is allowed only in cases of \"particularly serious crimes.\" The Greek criminal code translates \"particularly serious crimes\" as felonies while \"malicious blasphemy and offense of religion\" is considered a misdemeanor.\n\nFollowing the publication of the arrest, Greece's ruling coalition junior partner Democratic Left and the Greek Communist Party strongly denounced the arrest while leftist primary opposition party SYRIZA raised a second question to the parliament, this time concerning the legality of the arrest and the freedom of expression. The parliamentary spokesman of SYRIZA and MP Dimitrios Papadimoulis stated that he would appear as a defense witness in the trial of the arrestee and even the metropolitan bishop of Thessaloniki, Anthimos said on a radio show that he did \"not agree with the prosecution, better to leave him alone. No one can usurp the faith\". Supporters of the arrestee held a small protest in front of the Greek Parliament on September 28 and on the same night another one in the centre of Athens parodying an Orthodox litany.\n\nThe page creator mentioned that he plans on focusing his future activism on the repeal of Greece's blasphemy laws.\n\nOn January 16, 2014, the creator of the original \"Elder Pastitsios\" website was found guilty of \"repeatedly insulting religion\" and was sentenced to ten months in jail, suspended while the prosecutor had recommended a smaller sentence.

{"id": "1470208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1470208", "title": "Enfield Poltergeist", "text": "Enfield Poltergeist\n\nThe Enfield Poltergeist is the name given to claimed supernatural activity at 284 Green Street, a council house in Brimsdown, Enfield, England between 1977 and 1979 involving two sisters, aged 11 and 13. Some members of the Society for Psychical Research such as inventor Maurice Grosse and writer Guy Lyon Playfair believed the haunting to be genuine, while others such as Anita Gregory and John Beloff were \"unconvinced\" and found evidence the girls had faked incidents for the benefit of reporters. Members of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry, including stage magicians such as Milbourne Christopher, Joe Nickell and Bob Couttie, reviewed the case and criticised paranormal investigators for being overly credulous whilst also identifying features of the case as being indicative of a hoax.\n\nThe story attracted considerable press coverage in British newspapers such as the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Daily Mirror\", and has been the subject of books, featured in television documentaries, and dramatised in horror films.\n\nIn August 1977 single parent Peggy Hodgson called police to her rented home in Enfield after two of her four children said that furniture was moving and knocking sounds were heard on walls. The children included Margaret, age 14, and Janet, 11. A police constable said that she saw a chair \"wobble and slide\". Later claims included disembodied voices, loud noises, thrown rocks and toys, overturned chairs, and children levitating. Over a period of 18 months, more than 30 people, including neighbours, psychic researchers and journalists, said they saw heavy furniture moving of its own accord, objects being thrown across a room and the daughters seeming to levitate several feet off the ground. Many also heard—and recorded—unexplained knocking noises and a gruff voice. The activity in the house attracted considerable press attention and the story was covered in British newspapers such as the \"Daily Mail\" and \"Daily Mirror\" until reports came to an end in 1979.\n\nSociety for Psychical Research members Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair reported \"curious whistling and barking noises coming from Janet's general direction.\" Although Playfair maintained the haunting was genuine and wrote in his later book \"This House Is Haunted: The True Story of a Poltergeist\" (1980) that an \"entity\" was to blame for the disturbances, he often doubted the children's veracity and wondered if they were playing tricks and exaggerating. Still, Grosse and Playfair believed that even though some of the alleged poltergeist activity was faked by the girls, other incidents were genuine. Janet was detected in trickery; a video camera in the room next door caught her bending spoons and attempting to bend an iron bar. Grosse had observed Janet banging a broom handle on the ceiling and hiding his tape-recorder. According to Playfair, one of Janet's voices she called \"Bill\" displayed a \"habit of suddenly changing the topic—it was a habit Janet also had\".\n\nWhen Janet and Margaret admitted \"pranking\" to reporters, Grosse and Playfair compelled the girls to retract their confession. They were mocked by other researchers for being easily duped.\n\nThe psychical researcher Renée Haynes had noted that doubts were raised about the alleged poltergeist voice at the Second International SPR Conference at Cambridge in 1978, where video cassettes from the case were examined. The SPR investigator Anita Gregory stated the Enfield poltergeist case had been \"overrated\", characterising several episodes of the girls' behaviour as \"suspicious\" and speculated that the girls had \"staged\" some incidents for the benefit of reporters seeking a sensational story. John Beloff, a former president of the SPR, investigated and suggested Janet was practicing ventriloquism. Both Beloff and Gregory came to the conclusion that Janet and Margaret were playing tricks on the investigators.\n\nAmerican magician Milbourne Christopher briefly investigated, failed to observe anything that could be called paranormal and was dismayed by what he felt was suspicious activity on the part of Janet. Christopher would later conclude that \"the poltergeist was nothing more than the antics of a little girl who wanted to cause trouble and who was very, very, clever.\" Ventriloquist Ray Alan visited the house and concluded that Janet's male voices were simply vocal tricks.\n\nSceptic Joe Nickell examined the findings of paranormal investigators and criticised them for being overly credulous; when a supposedly disembodied demonic voice was heard, Playfair noted that, \"as always Janet's lips hardly seemed to be moving.\"\n\nNickell states that a remote-controlled still camera—the photographer was not present in the room with the girls—timed to take a picture every fifteen seconds was shown by investigator Melvin Harris to reveal \"pranking\" by the girls. He argues that a photo allegedly depicting Janet levitating actually shows her bouncing off the bed as if it were a trampoline. Harris called the photos examples of common \"gymnastics\", and said \"It's worth remembering that Janet was a school sports champion!\"\n\nNickell asserted that a tape recorder malfunction that Grosse attributed to supernatural activity and Society for Psychical Research president David Fontana described as an occurrence \"which appeared to defy the laws of mechanics\" was a peculiar threading jam capable of occurring with older model reel to reel tape recorders.\n\nNickell also claimed that demonologist Ed Warren was \"notorious for exaggerating and even making up incidents in such cases, often transforming a \"haunting\" case into one of \"demonic possession\".\n\nIn 2015, Deborah Hyde commented that there was no solid evidence for the Enfield poltergeist: \"... the first thing to note is that the occurrences didn't happen under controlled circumstances. People frequently see what they expect to see, their senses being organised and shaped by their prior experiences and beliefs.\"\n\nSceptics have argued that the alleged poltergeist voice that originated from Janet was produced by false vocal cords above the larynx and had the phraseology and vocabulary of a child. In a television interview for BBC Scotland, Janet was observed to gain attention by waving her hand, and then putting her hand in front of her mouth while a claimed \"disembodied\" voice was heard. During the interview both girls were asked the question \"How does it feel to be haunted by a poltergeist?\" Janet replied \"It's not haunted\" and Margaret, in a hushed tone, interrupted \"Shut up\". These factors have been regarded by sceptics as evidence against the case.\n\nAs \"a magician experienced in the dynamics of trickery\", Nickell examined Playfair's account as well as contemporary press clippings. He noted that the supposed poltergeist \"tended to act only when it was not being watched\" and concluded that the incidents were best explained as children's pranks. In an interview with the \"Daily Mail\", the adult Janet admitted that she and her sister had faked \"2 percent\" of the phenomena. This prompted Nickell to comment in another publication, \"the evidence suggests that this figure is closer to 100 percent\".\n\nAlthough Maurice Grosse made tape recordings of Janet and believed no trickery was involved, the magician Bob Couttie said, \"he made some of the recordings available to me and, having listened to them very carefully, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing in what I had heard that was beyond the capabilities of an imaginative teenager.\" An article by psychology professor Chris French in 2016 described five reasons why he believed the case to have been a hoax.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11429023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11429023", "title": "Goguryeo–Tang War", "text": "Goguryeo–Tang War\n\nThe Goguryeo–Tang War occurred from 645 to 668 and was initially fought between the Goguryeo kingdom and Tang Dynasty. During the course of the war the two sides allied with various other states. Goguryeo successfully repulsed the invading Tang armies during the first Tang invasions of 645-648. After conquering Baekje in 660, Tang and Silla armies invaded Goguryeo from the north and south in 661, but were forced to withdraw in 662. In 666, Yeon Gaesomun died and Goguryeo became plagued by violent dissension, numerous defections, and widespread demoralization. The Tang–Silla alliance mounted a fresh invasion in the following year, aided by the defector Yeon Namsaeng. In late 668, exhausted from numerous attacks and suffering from internal political chaos, the kingdom of Goguryeo and the remnants of Baekje army succumbed to the numerically superior armies of the Tang Dynasty and Silla.\n\nThe war marked the end of the Three Kingdoms of Korea period which had lasted since 57 BCE. It also triggered the Silla–Tang War during which Silla and the Tang Dynasty fought over the spoils they had gained.\n\nIn 627, Li Shimin (Emperor Taizong) succeeded the Tang throne after the Xuanwu Gate Incident, killing his two brothers—Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji—and forcing his father, Li Yuan (Emperor Gaozu), to abdicate. Soon thereafter, he set his mind to conquering Goguryeo. The Silla kingdom had made numerous requests to the Tang court for military assistance against Goguryeo, which the Tang court began to consider not long after they had decisively defeated the Göktürks in 628. At the same time, however, Silla was also engaged in open hostilities with Baekje in 642. A year before (641), King Uija had assumed the throne of Baekje. In 642, King Uija attacked Silla and captured around 40 strongpoints. Meanwhile, in 642, the military dictator Yeon Gaesomun murdered over 180 Goguryeo aristocrats and seized the Goguryeo throne. He placed a puppet king onto the throne after killing the king in 642. These newly formed governments in Baekje and Goguryeo were preparing for war and had established an mutual alliance against Tang and Silla.\n\nEmperor Taizong used Yeon Gaesomun's murder of the Goguryeo king as the pretext for his campaign and started preparations for an invasion force in 644. General Li Shiji commanded an army of 60,000 Tang soldiers and an undisclosed number of tribal forces. They would gather at Youzhou. Emperor Taizong commanded an armored cavalry of 10,000 strong. His cavalry would eventually meet up and join General Li Shiji's army during the expedition. A fleet of 500 ships would also transport an additional 40,000 conscripted soldiers and 3,000 military gentlemen (volunteers from the elite of Chang'an and Luoyang). This fleet would sail from the Liaodong Peninsula to the Korean Peninsula.\n\nIn April 645, General Li Shiji's army departed from Yincheng (present-day Chaoyang). On 1 May, they crossed the Liao River into Goguryeo territory. On 16 May, they laid siege to Gaimou (Kaemo), which fell after only 11 days, capturing 20,000 people and confiscating 100,000 \"shi\" (6 million liter) of grain.\n\nAfterwards, General Li Shiji's army advanced to Liaodong (Ryotong). On 7 June 645, they crushed a Goguryeo army of 40,000 troops strong, who were sent to the city to relieve the city from the Tang siege. A few days later, Emperor Taizong's cavalry arrived at Liaodong. On 16 June, the Tang army successfully set Liaodong ablaze with incendiary projectiles and breached its defensive walls, resulting in the fall of Liaodong to the Tang forces.\n\nThe Tang army marched further to Baiyan (Paekam) and arrived there on 27 June 645. However, the Goguryeo commanders surrendered the city to the Tang army. Afterwards, Emperor Taizong ordered that the city must not be looted and its citizens must not be enslaved.\n\nOn 18 July 645, the Tang army arrived at Ansi Fortress. A Goguryeo army, including Mohe troops, were sent to relieve the city. The reinforcing Goguryeo army totaled 150,000 troops. However, Emperor Taizong sent General Li Shiji with 15,000 troops to lure the Goguryeo forces. Meanwhile, another Tang force would secretly flank the enemy troops from behind. On 20 July, the two sides descended into battle and the Tang army came out victorious. Most of the Goguryeo troops dispersed after their defeat. The remaining Goguryeo troops fled to a nearby hill, but they surrendered the next day after a Tang encirclement. The Tang forces took 36,800 troops captive. Of these prisoners, the Tang forces sent 3500 officers and chieftains to China, executed 3300 Mohe troops, and eventually released the rest of the ordinary Goguryeo soldiers. However, the Tang army could not breach into the city of Ansi. This city was defended by the forces of Yang Manchun. Tang troops attacked the fortress as many as six or seven times per day, but the defenders repulsed them each time. As days and weeks passed, Emperor Taizong considered abandoning the siege of Ansi to advance deeper into Goguryeo, but Ansi was deemed to pose too great of a threat to abandon during the expedition. Eventually, Tang staked everything on the construction of a huge mound, but it was captured and successfully held by the defenders despite three days of frantic assaults by Tang troops. Furthermore, exacerbated by worsened conditions for the Tang army due to cold weather (and winter approaching) and diminishing provisions, Emperor Taizong was compelled to order a withdrawal from Goguryeo on October 13, but left behind an extravagant gift for the commander of Ansi Fortress. Tang Taizong's retreat was difficult and many of his soldiers died.\n\nTaizong himself tended to the injuries of the Tujue Generals Qibi Heli and Ashina Simo, who were both wounded during the campaign against Goguryeo.\n\nAfter Emperor Taizong's death in 649, the conquest of Goguryeo and the personal rivalry with Yeon Gaesomun became an obsession with Emperor Gaozong. Under Emperor Gaozong's reign, the Tang empire formed a military alliance with the Silla kingdom. When Goguryeo and Baekje attacked Silla from the north and west respectively, Queen Seondeok of Silla sent an emissary to the Tang empire to desperately request military assistance. In 650, Emperor Gaozong received a poem, written by Queen Jindeok of Silla, from the princely emissary Kim Chunchu (who would later accede the Silla throne as King Muyeol). In 653, Baekje allied with Yamato Wa. Even though Baekje was allied with Goguryeo, the Han River valley separated the two states and was a hindrance in coming to each other's aid in time of war. King Muyeol assumed the Silla throne in 654. Between 655 and 659, the border of Silla was harassed by Baekje and Goguryeo; Silla therefore requested assistance from Tang. In 658, Emperor Gaozong sent an army to attack Goguryeo but was unable to overcome Goguryeo's stalwart defenses. Kim Chunchu suggested to Tang that the Tang–Silla alliance first conquer Baekje, breaking up the Goguryeo–Baekje alliance, and then attack Goguryeo.\n\nIn 660, the Tang empire and the Silla kingdom sent their allied armies to conquer Baekje. The Baekje capital Sabi fell to the forces of Tang and Silla. Baekje was conquered on 18 July 660, when King Uija of Baekje surrendered at Ungjin. The Tang army took the king, crown prince, 93 officials, and 20,000 troops as prisoner. The king and crown prince were sent as hostages to the Tang empire. The Tang empire annexed the territory and established five military administrations to control the region instead of Silla, which they painfully accepted. In a final effort, General Gwisil Boksin led the resistance against Tang occupation of Baekje. He requested military assistance from their Yamato allies. The Tang fleet, comprising 170 ships, advanced towards Chuyu and encircled the city at the Baekgang River. As the Yamato fleet engaged the Tang fleet, they were attacked by the Tang fleet and were destroyed. In 663, the Baekje resistance and Yamato forces were annihilated by the Tang and Silla forces at the Battle of Baekgang. Subsequently, Prince Buyeo Pung of Baekje and his remaining men fled to Goguryeo.\n\nAfter the conquest of Baekje in 660, the Tang and Silla forces planned to invade Goguryeo. In 661, the Tang forces set off to Goguryeo. As the Tang army advanced with 350,000 troops, Silla was requested to provide only supplies during this expedition. In 662, Yeon Gaesomun defeated General Pang Xiaotai at the Battle of Sasu. The Tang army besieged Pyongyang, Goguryeo's capital, for several months until February 662, when it had to withdraw from the campaign due to the harsh winter conditions, and the defeat of its subsidiary force.\n\nIn 666, the Goguryeo dictator Yeon Gaesomun died and an internal struggle between his sons for power broke out. Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by the succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son (and successor) defecting to Tang and his younger brother defecting to Silla. Yeon Gaesomun's death paved the way for a fresh invasion by Tang and Silla in 667, this time aided by Yeon Gaesomun's oldest son. The violent dissension resulting from Yeon Gaesomun's death proved to be the primary reason for the Tang–Silla triumph, thanks to the division, defections, and widespread demoralization it caused. The alliance with Silla also proved to be invaluable, thanks to the ability to attack Goguryeo from opposite directions, and both military and logistical aid from Silla. In 668, the Tang and Silla forces besieged and conquered Pyongyang, which led to the conquest of Goguryeo. Over 200,000 prisoners were taken by the Tang forces and sent to Chang'an.\n\nIn 669, the Tang government established the Protectorate General to Pacify the East to control the former territories of Goguryeo. A subordinate office was in Baekje. By the end of the war, the Tang empire had taken control over the former territories of Baekje and Goguryeo and tried to assert dominion over Silla. Large parts of the Korean Peninsula were occupied by the Tang forces for about a decade.\n\nHowever, the Tang occupation of the Korean Peninsula proved to be logistically difficult due to shortage of supplies, which Silla used to provide previously. Furthermore, Emperor Gaozong was ailing, so Empress Wu took a pacifist policy, and the Tang empire was diverting resources towards other priorities. This situation favored Silla, because soon Silla would have to forcibly resist the imposition of Chinese rule over the entire peninsula. War was imminent between Silla and Tang.\n\nAfter the fall of Goguryeo, Dae Jo Young gathered Goguryeo people and Malgal people and fought against Tang Dynasty to restore Goguryeo. Dae Jo-Young successfully established Balhae after declaring victory at the Battle of Cheonmunryeong.\n\n"}
{"id": "1178120", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1178120", "title": "Headline News (song)", "text": "Headline News (song)\n\n\"Headline News\" is a parody song by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic. It is a parody of the Crash Test Dummies's 1993 hit \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". It was released as the lead-off single for the compilation box set \"\" on September 27, 1994. The song was written after Yankovic's label insisted he craft a new song to promote the album; Yankovic in turn combined the music of the Crash Test Dummies' song with three news stories that were popular in late 1993 and early 1994.\n\nTo help promote the song and album, Yankovic directed a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented as if they are one-act plays to an audience. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as Doug Llewelyn, Dr. Demento and Judy Tenuta.\n\nThe song and video were met with mostly positive reviews from critics, although at least one critic noted that the source material would soon become dated. The Crash Test Dummies themselves were very pleased with the final result and even performed the song with Yankovic in concert twice. \"Headline News\" charted at number four on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, making it Yankovic's first single to chart domestically since 1992's \"Smells Like Nirvana\".\n\nWhile Yankovic was writing the original songs for a new album—which was later released in 1996 as \"Bad Hair Day\"—his label, Scotti Brothers Records, insisted that he release a new record in order to meet monetary projections for the fourth fiscal quarter of the year. Yankovic, however, explained that he would be unable to finish a new record in time, so his label decided to release a box set entitled \"\". The label then stipulated that Yankovic would need to at least record a new single to promote the box set.\n\nYankovic had previously heard \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" during 1994 and felt that it was \"one of two or three songs\" that could be potentially parodied. He noted that it \"would be really good to do for the next album\", but felt that \"when the time is right, [he would] think of something\" to write the parody about; he then returned his attention to writing original songs. After Scotti Brothers insisted on the writing of a new lead single, Yankovic very nearly had his label cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure. However, he soon returned to the idea of parodying \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\". He decided to pair the song's music up with \"all the weird news stories that were going on\" and make each verse its own vignette. Yankovic also felt that by doing this and releasing it on the box set, he would be able to capitalize on the topicality of the issues.\n\nWhile the original song's verses each told the story of three abnormal children, each verse of \"Headline News\" tells the story of three famous tabloid stories of 1993 and 1994: the American delinquent Michael Fay being caned in Singapore, figure skater Tonya Harding's ex-husband attacking her rival Nancy Kerrigan, and Lorena Bobbitt severing her husband's penis with a knife. (In this last verse, Yankovic substitutes the term \"penis\" with euphemisms like \"wiener\" and \"Mr. Happy\".) Yankovic later joked that he \"wanted to write a song about these people because [he didn't] think they're getting quite enough media attention\", a reference to the stories' over-saturation in the news.\n\nRecording for the song itself started on July 27, 1994, at Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California. Backing Yankovic were Jon \"Bermuda\" Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, Jim West on guitar, and Kim Bullard on keyboards. Lisa Popeil provides the female backup vocals, as well as the scream of Nancy Kerrigan. The song also features various idiosyncratic elements to increase the humor, such as manualist sound effects courtesy of Mike Kieffer. Additionally, the ending features a chorus of kazoos, and Yankovic plays a short riff of the song on his trademark instrument, the accordion. Yankovic himself produced the session. Due to the vocal part of the original being in such a low register, Yankovic had to record the parody's vocal tracks early in the morning, when his voice was naturally lower.\n\nThe music video for \"Headline News\" parodies the \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" video in that it presents each news story as a one-act play on stage before an audience of people. The video was directed by Yankovic, making it his third directoral credit after 1986's \"Christmas at Ground Zero\" and 1993's \"Bedrock Anthem\". Yankovic appears as Brad Roberts, and his band appears as the other members of the Crash Test Dummies; notably, the video also marks the on-screen debut of Yankovic's official keyboardist, Rubén Valtierra, who appears in drag as Ellen Reid. The video was filmed on August 29 and 31, 1994. All of the scenes that took place at the school were filmed during the day at Longfellow Elementary School Auditorium, in Pasadena, California. The scenes at the ice rink were filmed at night in a rink in Paramount, California. According to Yankovic, the crew ran over time and it was a rather expensive video. Yankovic noted that \"without giving you the actual number\", he could have \"recorded two albums, probably, for what it cost to do that one video.\" The video features several celebrity cameos, including an appearance by Doug Llewelyn of People's Court fame, and long time radio show host Dr. Demento. Comedian Judy Tenuta also appears as Lorena Bobbitt.\n\n\"Headline News\" was released on September 26, 1994, as the lead-off single for \"Permanent Record: Al in the Box\", which was also released a day later. Yankovic also insisted that the song be commercially available as a CD single so that his fans who are completists would not have to purchase the expensive box set just to get the new song. Much like the cover for the Crash Test Dummies's 1993 studio album \"God Shuffled His Feet\", the cover for Yankovic's single superimposes his face over the figures of Titian's painting \"Bacchus and Ariadne\". The art direction is credited to Doug Haverty, and design is credit to Daniel Sorenson, David McDougall. The b-side of \"Headline News\" was a remix of Yankovic's 1986 original song \"Christmas at Ground Zero\". The song was never officially released on a studio album, although it did appear on Yankovic's \"Greatest Hits Volume II\" album, which was released a month later on October 25, 1994. The single charted and peaked at number four on the \"Billboard\" Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which corresponds to a position of 104 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. This made it Yankovic's first domestically charting single since 1992's \"Smells Like Nirvana\".\n\nBrad Roberts, the original songwriter for \"Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm\" was extremely pleased with the parody, and found it humorous. He later noted that, \"People assume that I was annoyed but when [Yankovic] does a parody of you, you know you've made it.\" He later praised the way Yankovic interacted with the artists that he parodies, noting that \"Weird Al goes the whole route and cultivates a relationship with the artist. Plus he gets half the earnings and that helps me make money.\"\n\n\"Headline News\" received mostly positive reviews from music critics. Lou Carlozo of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote that the song \"provided savage laughs at the expense of Tonya Harding and John Bobbitt.\" Roch Parisien of Allmusic cited the song as one of the three stand-outs from Yankovic's second greatest hits volume, and called it a \"rib-tickler\". Tina Maps of \"The Milwaukee Journal\" wrote a positive review and felt that the musical parody was a \"dead-on skewering of the Crash Test Dummies' 'Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm\". Not all reviews, however, were so positive; an article that appeared in \"The Commercial Appeal\" noted that while the video for \"Headline News\" had some \"cute bits and unusual cameos\", it was \"not as clever as many of Yankovic's past efforts\" and that \"the current events included here are already dated\".\n\nYankovic first started performing \"Headline News\" in August 1994, almost a month before it was officially released. In addition, Yankovic has performed the song with the Crash Test Dummies twice: once on Canada's MuchMusic channel and another time at the House of Blues in Los Angeles. Reportedly, during one of the performances, Ellen Reid, backing vocalist and keyboardist for the Crash Test Dummies, went out and purchased kazoos. The band then hid the instruments until the end of the song, when they took them out and played them; this \"came as a big surprise to\" Yankovic. Yankovic's \"Straight Outta Lynwood\" concert tour contained new lyrics as part of a parody medley, referencing Britney Spears, dealing with her 2007 head-shaving shock and underpants-less limousine trip in late 2006. Later in the tour, he changed it to reference Paris Hilton's DUI and imprisonment, and her subsequent interview on \"Larry King Live\".\n\n\n\n\n"}

Ivan Coyote’s \"You Are Here\" was originally scheduled for a cabaret run in 2009, but was cancelled in January of that year.\n\nThe festival name alludes ironically to female hysteria, an archaic medical diagnosis applied to women the 19th and early 20th centuries. The festival's name is about embracing women's disobedience and reclaiming the term \"hysteria\".\n\n2009 was a year marked by an increase in the production of women's theatre works at Buddies in Bad Times, in large part due to the publication of an Arts report by Canada Arts Council, entitled, \"Adding it Up: The Status of Women in Canadian Theatre,\" which showed the vast majority of plays appearing on Canadian stage coming from male playwright's. following this season, however, a shift occurred in the programming, beginning with the decision not to renew King's contract as artistic associate. This decision was made with the caveat that King's festival, Hysteria, would continue to run, even without her presence. While that commitment was made, the festival has ceased since she left. Since then, Strange Sisters has been revived, a one-night festival of queer women's work. In 2015, it was renamed Insatiable Sisters by co-curators Kim Katrin Crosby and Gein Wong. Insatiable Sisters highlights new performance works of queer womyn and trans* folks.\n"}

Cupp\n\nJames Norman Cupp (28 March 1921 – 2 June 2004) was a United States Marine Corps aviator during World War II. Cupp was a double flying ace with at least 12 aerial victories in the Solomon Islands during three months of World War II. He was a recipient of the Navy Cross, the navy's second highest military decoration for valor and was a four time recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross. Also a Korean War veteran, he retired as a colonel to Manassas, Virginia in 1968.\n\nJames Norman Cupp was born in Corning, Iowa on 28 March 1921. He graduated from High School in Red Oak, Iowa in 1938. He attended the University of Iowa for two years, taking his Sophomore finals two months early so he could join the Navy V-5 flight training program. In college, Cupp was an avid swimmer and diver. He was also a member of Dolphin Fraternity, a national honorary swimming organization.\n\nCupp enlisted in the Navy on 15 May 1941 and entered the V-5 flight training program. He graduated at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas 9 January 1942 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, 27 February 1942. On 3 March 1942, he married Daphne Snider, of Fairfield, Iowa. Cupp then attended aerial photography training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida.\n\nCupp was attached to VMF-213, the Hell Hawks, in September 1942 at Marine Corps Air Station Ewa and later flew the Vought F4U Corsair. He had his crew paint Daphne \"C\", for his wife, on the engine cowling of his Corsair. He arrived at the Solomon Islands for his first combat tour on 3 April 1943. Cupp scored his first aerial victory on 15 July 1943 and was an ace three days later. During his tour he was credited with 13 1/2 or 13 aerial victories based on reports by his wingmen. According to Guttman (2005), he was officially credited with 12 victories.\n\nOn 20 September 1943, Captain Cupp was shot down north of Kolombangara by a G4M1 Betty with an improvised gun unexpectedly mounted in its bomb bay; he was severely burned. He spent the next 18 months in hospitals, primarily Oak Knoll Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. After that, he served as a Naval flight instructor. The war ended before he could return to the Pacific theater.\n\nCupp served in the Korean War and received his fourth Distinguished Flying Cross for service during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir where he was an air officer on the ground, responsible for directing close air support operations.\n\nAfter World War II, he served as commanding officer for VMO-6 in Tsingtao, China, HQ Squadron, 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in Tientsin, China, Marine Detachment (MARDET) Naval Air Station New Orleans, MARDET Naval Air Station Glenview, VMFT-10 at Marine Corps Air Station El Toro and Marine Air Control Squadron 1 in Taiwan.\n\nColonel Cupp retired to Manassas, Virginia in 1968, selling real estate until 1973. He died on 2 June 2004 and was buried at Stonewall Memory Gardens, Manassas, Virginia.\n\nHis decorations include the Navy Cross, four Distinguished Flying Cross awards, Bronze Star Medal with \"V\" Device, Purple Heart, Air Medal, Navy Commendation Medal with \"V\" Device, three Presidential Unit Citations and other campaign awards.\n\n\n"}

Lao New Year widely celebrated festival in Laos. The festival is also celebrated by the Lao in the United States of America, Canada, France, England and Australia. Lao New Year takes place in April, the hottest time of the year in Laos, which is also the start of the monsoon season. Lao New Year takes place at roughly the same time as the new year celebrations of many countries in South Asia like Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe official festival lasts for three days from April 14 to April 16 (although celebrations can last more than a week in towns like Luang Prabang). The first day is the last day of the old year. Houses and villages are properly cleaned on the first day. Perfume, water and flowers are also prepared for the Lao New Year. The second day of the festival is the \"day of no year\", a day that falls in neither the old year or the new year. The last day of the festival marks the start of the new year. In Laos, Lao New Year is a government holiday, with state offices closed during those three days.\n\nWater is used for washing homes, Buddha images, monks, and soaking friends and passers-by. Students first respectfully pour water on their elders, then monks for blessings of long life and peace, and last of all they throw water at each other. The water is perfumed with flowers or natural perfumes. Some people prefer flowers in the water to give a pleasant smell, as well as adding cologne/perfume. Over the years another tradition has developed with Lao New Year: people will smear or throw cream (shaving cream or whipped cream) or white powder on each other during the celebrations.\n\nSand is brought to the temple grounds and is made into stupas or mounds, then decorated before being given to the monks as a way of making merit. There are two ways to make the sand stupas. One way is to go to the beach, and the other way is to bring sand to the \"vat\", or temple. Sand stupas are decorated with flags, flowers, white lines, and splashed with perfumed water. Sand stupas symbolize the mountain, Phoukhao Kailat, where King Kabinlaphrôm's head was kept by his seven daughters.\n\nAnother way to make merit at this time is to set animals free. The Lao believe that even animals need to be free. The most commonly freed animals are tortoises, fish, crabs, birds, eels, and other small animals.\n\nFlowers are gathered to decorate Buddha images. In the afternoons people collect fresh flowers. Senior monks take the younger monks to a garden filled with flowers, where they pick flowers and bring back to the \"wat\" to wash. People who didn't participate in the flower picking bring baskets to wash the flowers so the flowers can shine with the Buddha statues.\nIn the evening lao people usually go to the temple to worship the Buddhas.\n\nThere is an annual beauty pageant in Luang Prabang to crown Miss Pi Mai Lao (Miss Lao New Year). There are many beauty pageants in Laos, but Luang Prabang - the old capital - is widely known for its \"Nangsangkhan\" pageant. There are seven contestants, each one symbolizing one of King Kabinlaphrôm's seven daughters.\n\nDuring Lao New Year, there are many spectacles including traditional Lao music and social dancing, \"molam\", and \"lamvông\" (circle dancing). During the daytime many people go to the temple to worship, hoping to have a healthier and happier life in the new year. During the evening, people of all ages go to the temple for entertainment.\n\nIn greetings there are several ways to wish someone a happy Lao New Year. The most common expressions are \"sôk di pi mai\", \"souksan van pi mai\" or \"sabaidi pi mai\", which can be translated into English as \"Happy New Year\".\n\n\n "}

This list may have some overlap with the larger topic list of folk festivals, and may also overlap with the related topics list of blues festivals, list of jam band music festivals, list of bluegrass music festivals, and list of old-time music festivals. Many of the festivals take place in North America.\n\nCountry music is a genre of American popular music that originated in Southern United States, in Atlanta, Georgia in the 1920s, and It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of American folk music and Western music. The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white, working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. Barn dancing and other folk dance styles would be featured at country music gatherings, and many modern festivals have continued to feature dance, rodeo, or other cultural aspects.\n\nThe term \"country music\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term hillbilly music, it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \"country music\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres, and festivals may focus on Americana genres such as bluegrass, or newer genres such as country rock, country pop, or alternative country.\n\n\n"}

Beginning in 1917 Otto Falckenberg served as director; in 1926 he moved the company into the \"Schauspielhaus\", built in Art Nouveau style in 1901 by Richard Riemerschmid and Max Littmann. Since 1933 the Münchner Kammerspiele has been a municipal theatre company of the City of Munich. Since 1961 the \"Werkraumtheater\" has served as its second stage. In 2001 the company gained a rehearsal stage next to the \"Schauspielhaus\" in a large building designed by Gustav Peichl.\n\nSince the 1920s the Münchner Kammerspiele has presented numerous world premieres, including works by Friedrich Dürrenmatt, Frank Wedekind and Bertolt Brecht. Brecht, Bruno Hübner, Axel von Ambesser, Fritz Kortner, Peter Stein, Franz Xaver Kroetz, Robert Wilson, George Tabori, Erwin Faber, Max Schreck and other important actors and writers have staged plays with the company, often resulting in awards. \n\nOne famous producing-director (Intendant) of the Münchner Kammerspiele was Falckenberg (1917-1944). Known as an expert in Expressionism in Germany during the Weimar Republic, he was credited with producing or directing many celebrated productions at the company, including Brecht’s first staged play, Drums in the Night, in 1922, as well as works by Wedekind, August Strindberg and William Shakespeare. Since the 1945 end of World War II, artistic leadership has been in the hands of: Erich Engel (1945-1947), Hans Schweikart (1947-1963), August Everding (1963-1973), Hans-Reinhard Müller (1973-1983), Dieter Dorn (1983-2001) and Frank Baumbauer (2001-2009).

{"id": "186339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186339", "title": "National Railway Museum", "text": "National Railway Museum\n\nThe National Railway Museum (NRM) is a museum in York forming part of the British Science Museum Group of National Museums and telling the story of rail transport in Britain and its impact on society. It has won many awards, including the European Museum of the Year Award in 2001. It is the home of the national collection of historically significant railway vehicles, as well as a collection of other artefacts and both written and pictorial records.\nThe National Railway Museum in York displays a collection of over 100 locomotives and nearly 300 other items of rolling stock, virtually all of which either ran on the railways of Great Britain or were built there. Also on the site are many hundreds of thousands of other items and records of social, technical, artistic and historical interest, exhibited mostly in three large halls of a former motive power depot next to the East Coast Main Line, near York railway station. \n\nIt is the largest museum of its type in Britain, attracting 727,000 visitors during the 2014/15 financial year (the largest in the world in terms of floor area of exhibition buildings is La Cité du Train in the French town of Mulhouse, although this attracts far fewer visitors than the National Railway Museum).\n\nThe National Railway Museum was established on its present site, the former York North locomotive depot, in 1975, when it took over the former British Railways collection located in Clapham and the York Railway Museum located off Queen Street, immediately to the southeast of the railway station; since then, the collection has continued to grow.\n\nThe museum is a short walk from the railway station in York, either on the road or via a staircase from the rear of the platforms. A \"roadtrain\" runs from the city centre (near York Minster) to the museum on Leeman Road during half term, holidays and summer. York Park and Ride also serve the museum from the car park entrance, on Line 2 (Rawcliffe Bar-York). Admission to the museum has been free since 2001. It is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm from February to November and 10 am to 5 pm during the winter months.\n\nLocomotion – the National Railway Museum in Shildon, County Durham was opened in October 2004 and is operated by the NRM in conjunction with Durham County Council. It houses more of the National Collection in a new building and a historic site around the former workshop of Timothy Hackworth and in the most recent full year for which figures have been published (2011–2012), it attracted more than 210,000 visitors.\n\nThere are approximately 280 rail vehicles in the National Collection, with around 100 being at York at any one time and the remainder divided between Locomotion at Shildon and other museums and heritage railways. The earliest are wagonway vehicles of about 1815. The permanent display includes \"Palaces on Wheels\", a collection of Royal Train saloons from Queen Victoria's early trains through to those used by Queen Elizabeth II up to the 1970s, among them some of the first rail vehicles to be set aside for preservation.\nOther key exhibits normally to be seen at York include the 1846 Furness Railway No. 3 \"Coppernob\" locomotive, and the more modern express passenger steam locomotives London and North Eastern Railway Class A3 No. 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\" (added to the collection in 2004),\nits streamlined sister Class A4 No. 4468 \"Mallard\" and London, Midland and Scottish Railway Princess Coronation Class No. 6229 \"Duchess of Hamilton\". \"Flying Scotsman\" is among the exhibits intended for operation on the National Rail network from time to time.\n\nThe museum has imported several major vehicles for display: the Chinese Class KF7 4–8–4 locomotive donated in 1981 was built in Britain and the \"Wagons-Lits\" sleeping car donated in 1980 had been used on the Paris-London \"Night Ferry\" service. The single exception to the rule of exhibits associated with Britain is the Japanese 0 Series Shinkansen leading vehicle which was donated to the museum by the West Japan Railway Company in 2001 and which now forms part of an award-winning display, and is the only Shinkansen vehicle on exhibit outside Japan.\n\nRail vehicles on display are exchanged from time to time with other organisations, and examples of new-build stock from the current industry sometimes visit the museum for short periods.\n\nOther physically large exhibits are the Stockton and Darlington Railway Gaunless Bridge and several stationary winding engines used on railway inclines.\n\nThe many other two and three-dimensional elements of the collection include signalling equipment, road vehicles, ship models, posters, drawings and other artwork,\ntickets, nameplates, staff uniforms, clocks, watches, furniture and equipment from railway companies' hotels, refreshment rooms and offices (including company seals) and a wide range of models, some of which are operated on the museum's O scale model railway (originated in 1982).\n\nThe National Railway Museum holds a large open library and archive of railway related material. This includes an internationally significant collection of locomotive and rolling stock engineering drawings from railway works and independent manufacturing companies. Copies of many of these engineering drawings are sold to the heritage railway movement to assist with their new build locomotive and restoration projects. They are also sold to modellers who can use the drawing to produce accurate scale models. The library holds more than 20,000 books and 800 journals of which around 300 are active. The archive also holds a large collection of technical and test records, as well as timetables including a large number of Bradshaw timetables. The archives also hold some 1.75 million photographs covering the earliest era of photography to the modern day. These include official collections from railway companies and collections from enthusiasts like Eric Treacy and H. Gordon Tidey.\n\nIn 1999/2000 the Museum began to collect recordings of former railway staff for a National Archive of Railway Oral History. It also holds the archive of steam train recordings by Peter Handford. In 2009 The Forsythe Collection of travel and transport ephemera was acquired for the collection. Many of the museum's artworks and posters can also be viewed through Search Engine although these are now displayed in a series of temporary exhibitions in the museum's new art gallery which opened in 2011.\n\nThe Search Engine facility opened in late 2007 and is open from 10:00 to 17:30 Wednesday to Saturday. The archive and library collections can be viewed by anyone without an appointment although the website recommends pre-booking archive materials at least 24 hours in advance. The majority of its collections have been listed on its website for people to view what materials are available prior to their visit. For those people that cannot visit the museum itself there is a research service offered by the museum called Inreach.\n\nAlthough there had been amateur attempts to establish a national railway museum from the late 19th century, the National Collection today results from the fusion of two long-running official initiatives. One was led by the State museums sector, evidencing pioneering technology, and the other by the railway industry, in which the key contribution came from the North Eastern Railway as successors to the historic Stockton and Darlington Railway.\n\nWhat became the Science Museum collection was begun in the 1860s by the Patent Office, whose museum included such early relics as \"Puffing Billy\", Stephenson’s \"Rocket\" and \"Agenoria\" (sister locomotive to \"Stourbridge Lion\"), which was outhoused to York at an early date.\n\nPreservation of redundant equipment by the railway companies themselves was a matter of chance. Sometimes relics were stored in company workshops and offices and some were destroyed as circumstances changed. Where put on public display at all the equipment was usually mounted on railway stations in a case or on a plinth. \"Coppernob\" at Barrow-in-Furness, \"Derwent\" and \"Locomotion\" at Darlington and \"Tiny\" at Newton Abbot were long-lived examples of this form of display.\n\nThe first railway museums were opened at Hamar in Norway (1896) and Nuremberg in Germany (1899). These inspired talk of doing the same in Britain, both in the 1890s and again in 1908, but this came to nothing at that time. Indeed, two of the Great Western Railway’s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, \"North Star\" and \"Lord of the Isles\", which had been set aside at Swindon Works, were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.\n\nFrom 1880, J. B. Harper of the North Eastern had been collecting material much of which was exhibited on the occasion of the S.& D.R. centenary in 1925; and which then formed the basis of a museum opened at York by the London and North Eastern Railway in 1928 under the curatorship of E. M. Bywell.\n\nThe smaller exhibits were housed in the old station buildings and the rolling stock and other large exhibits in the former locomotive erecting and repair shops of the old York and North Midland Railway (demolished after the museum closed). Despite this however, the locomotives were displayed on short lengths of track acting as plinths, very much in traditional museum style. It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits could come and go with ease.\n\nThe collection was dominated by items from the North Eastern Railway, together with Great Northern Railway items. The other three ‘Big Four’ railway companies showed little interest in contributing to the LNER’s initiative, though eventually one locomotive representative of each did find its way there: the Great Western's \"City of Truro\", London and North Western Railway \"Columbine\" and London, Brighton and South Coast Railway B1 Class \"Gladstone\".\n\nThe GWR assembled a valuable collection of small objects, mounted privately in a long corridor at Paddington station, and in 1925 it built a replica of \"North Star\". It preserved \"City of Truro\" and \"Tiny\" in 1931 and purchased \"Shannon\" for preservation in 1946.\n\nThe LMS had its own collection of small objects at Euston. It also began to build up a collection of historic locomotives, which included Caledonian 123, \"Columbine\", \"Cornwall\", \"Hardwicke\", Highland 103, Midland 118 and \"Pet\". Three others, set aside for preservation at Crewe Works, were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation. It also succeeded in preserving a collection of historic royal saloons at Wolverton and built a replica \"Rocket\", with six replica carriages, for the Liverpool & Manchester Railway centenary in 1930, and a replica Grand Junction Railway Travelling Post Office.\n\nThe Southern Railway inherited three preserved carriages of the Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway, long displayed at York and at Waterloo station, but otherwise had no policy of preserving redundant equipment. \"Ryde\" was preserved from 1934 until cut up in 1940; the only other locomotive preserved by the Southern was \"Boxhill\" in 1947. (\"Gladstone\" was preserved by the Stephenson Locomotive Society as a private initiative and much later (in 1959) donated to the British Transport Commission.)\nThe nationalisation of British Railways in 1948 gave the opportunity for a more consolidated approach and a report was produced by the British Transport Commission in 1951.\n\nAmongst other things this recommended a curator be appointed for the Commission’s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not carried out in the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at Euston railway station (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, the former station at Nine Elms was originally favoured as a site, but what was eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former bus garage in Clapham.\nAn official list of locomotives for preservation was compiled,\nand many were stored in sheds and works throughout the country, others being placed on loan to local authority museums. The 'Steam' Museum at Swindon still displays a large number of items from the National Collection, while the Glasgow Museum of Transport was also indebted to it, although many of the Scottish relics (including NBR K 'Glen' Class 4-4-0 No. 256 \"Glen Douglas\" currently at the Bo'ness & Kinneil Railway) no longer form part of the National Collection.\n\nThe Beeching Report recommended that British Rail should stop running museums, and a campaign was led by transport historian L. T. C. Rolt and others such as the historian Jack Simmons to create a new museum.\nAgreement was reached under terms in the Transport Act 1968 for B.R. to provide premises to be occupied by a National Railway Museum which would be a branch of the National Museum of Science and Industry then under Dame Margaret Weston and the first English national museum outside London – a move which was at the time criticised by Londoners.\n\nThe building provided was the former locomotive roundhouse at York North (rebuilt in the 1950s), alongside the East Coast Main Line. The old museum and that at Clapham were closed in 1973. A Sainsbury's supermarket now stands on the Clapham site. Some items were retained in the capital and formed the basis of the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden. Some from York were re-located to the Darlington Railway Centre and Museum. Exhibits from the previous museums at York and Clapham moved to the new site were supplemented by vehicles taken from storage at Preston Park in Brighton and elsewhere and restored. Creation of the York museum was largely in the hands of its first keeper, Dr John Coiley,\nhis deputy Peter Semmens,\nJohn Van Riemsdijk of the Science Museum and David Jenkinson.\n\nThe museum was opened by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh in 1975. The opening coincided with the 150th anniversary celebrations of the opening of the Stockton & Darlington Railway, for which several working exhibits were provided. By comparison with the museum’s predecessors coverage of ordinary passenger coaches and non-steam motive power was enhanced, but a popular new exhibit was ex-Southern Railway Merchant Navy Class No. 35029 \"Ellerman Lines\" sectioned to show the workings of a steam locomotive. The new museum received over a million visitors in its first year and was favourably received by critics.\n\nSignificant events of 1979 were the restoration of a train of appropriate vehicles to mark the centenary of on-train catering and an exhibition to mark the centenary of railway electric traction which drew attention to the museum's important collections in this area.\n\nAlso in 1979 the museum commissioned a working replica of Stephenson's Rocket for the following year’s Liverpool and Manchester Railway 150th anniversary. This has since represented the museum at events around the world.\n\nAnother working replica was added to the collection for the 150th anniversary of establishment of the Great Western Railway in 1985: that of the broad gauge locomotive \"Iron Duke\".\n\nIn 1990, The Rev. W. Awdry's Railway Series Thomas the Tank Engine books were assured a permanent place in the NRM's collection of historical railway books, due to their role in maintaining children's interests in railways. In 1991, Christopher Awdry chose to fictionalise this event in \"Thomas and the Great Railway Show\", where Thomas (the most iconic of Awdry's characters) was made an honorary member of the NRM collection by Sir Topham Hatt and the Director of the NRM.\n\nConcerns about the condition of the concrete roof structure on the main building brought forward major changes to the museum in 1990. To maintain a presence at York, the former York goods depot across Leeman Road, already in use as a museum store (the Peter Allen Building), was configured to display trains as if in a passenger station, and this together with the adjacent South Yard was marketed as \"The Great Railway Show\". A further selection of exhibits formed the \"National Railway Museum on Tour\" on display for a season in the former Swindon Works.\n\nMeanwhile, the main building was completely re-roofed and reconstructed retaining only one of the two original 1954 turntables.\n\nIt was reopened on 16 April 1992 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent as the Great Hall giving enhanced opportunities to display large artifacts such as railway signals, a footbridge from Percy Main station and a segment from the Channel Tunnel. The former goods shed display was retained as the Station Hall.\nIn 1995 the museum joined forces with the University of York to create an academic research base, the Institute of Railway Studies (and Transport History). It has also since partnered with York College to create the Yorkshire Rail Academy to teach vocational skills. The museum has also provided engineering apprenticeships and participates in partnerships aimed at delivering heritage skills training.\n\nIn 1996 the Museum Garden was created incorporating a gauge ridable miniature railway. A playground was also added.\n\nContinued concern over the condition of the remaining 1950s buildings on the site led to their replacement by \"The Works\" in 1999. This gave several functional areas: the \"Workshop\", for maintenance of rolling stock; the \"Workshop Gallery\", from which the public can look down on this work; a \"Working Railway Gallery\", giving an insight into current and recent operation including a balcony overlooking York railway station hosting a set of monitors showing live feeds from the monitors at York IECC; and the \"Warehouse\" which provides an innovative open storage area, which has proved popular with both public and museum professionals.\n\nIn order to provide step-free access from the main hall to the Workshop Gallery, the Museum Inclinator was constructed. Besides its primary function, this also served to demonstrate the workings of a funicular railway. To that end its workings were exposed in the style of a larger open air funicular railway, rather than being concealed in the fabric of the building as is more normal for intramural lifts. Unfortunately, due to lack of spare parts, it ceased working, and with no plans for repair it was removed by August 2013.\n\n2004 saw several major developments at the museum. Several railway anniversaries were celebrated by a major \"Railfest\".\n\nAnother took place from 25–30 May 2008 with a Sixties theme. The Locomotion museum was opened at Shildon, County Durham providing undercover collection care facilities for more rail vehicles (particularly freight wagons) from the museum's collection. In addition, the museum had a high-profile campaign, supported by the National Heritage Memorial Fund, to purchase \"Flying Scotsman\" which arrived at the Museum as the climax of Railfest.\n\nThe first stage of a new centre providing easy access to the museum’s Library and Archives, called \"Search Engine\", opened at the end of 2007.\n\nFrom 18 July to 23 August 2008, a popular new venture was the staging by York Theatre Royal at the Museum of the play of E. Nesbit's \"The Railway Children\", awarded five stars in \"The Guardian\". Following this success, it was repeated in 2009, from 23 July to 3 September, and the museum provided locomotives for subsequent performances at Waterloo International station and in Toronto.\n\nMajor plans under the name \"NRM+\" were made for refurbishing the Great Hall display, for which a preliminary Heritage Lottery Fund contribution was announced in 2009, and seeking potential partners for a further outhousing project.\n\nThere are other partnerships for development of the museum estate and the land around it (much owned by Network Rail) as \"York Central\" but the economic situation during 2009 put these particular plans in abeyance although a similar York Central project was launched by the city council at the beginning of 2016. The NRM+ project was cancelled in April 2011 due to lack of success in assembling the funding package. However, major changes to the displays in the Station Hall began later in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, the NRM decided to repatriate temporarily the two LNER A4 class steam locomotives, numbers 60008 \"Dwight D Eisenhower\" and 60010 \"Dominion of Canada\" from their homes at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wis. and Exporail in Montreal, Quebec, as part of the \"'Mallard\" 75' event in 2013. The two locomotives would be on loan for up to two years, during which time the locomotives would be cosmetically restored, 60008 in BR Brunswick Green (as it appeared in 1963 on withdrawal) and 60010 as LNER 4489 in Garter Blue with its original Canadian Pacific Railway bell (as it appeared in 1939).\n\nOn 8 December 2012 it was announced that an annex to the National Railway Museum would be built close to Leicester North station on the Great Central Railway (heritage railway).\n\nIn June 2013, the \"York Press\" reported that NRM was facing a funding crisis due to a potential 10% annual cut to the Science Museum Group's funding, an estimated real-terms 25% cut following lay-offs and disbandment of projects. The museum was considering scaling down its functions, re-introducing admissions charges or facing complete closure. However, following a campaign by local residents the Chancellor George Osborne announced a 5% cut in the museum's budget. This prompted Science Museum Group director Ian Blatchford to announce two weeks later that the museum had been doubly saved — he added that had the 10% cut taken place the Group would have chosen to close the National Media Museum in Bradford.\n\nCriticisms of the museum which have been raised include claims that it has devoted insufficient attention to modern traction; that it was neglecting scholarship in favour of commercialism; or that its photographic collections constitute a \"black hole\". The museum's response is that these criticisms do not always take into account the financial constraints under which the museum operates: its Grant in Aid from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport amounts to £6.50 per visitor which delivers less overall income than for comparable London museums. For some of its funding the museum depends on money-making events such as the Yorkshire Wheel, which operated at the museum from 2006 to 2008 and visits from Thomas the Tank Engine as chronicled in \"Thomas and the Great Railway Show\". The museum has also suffered a few thefts of objects.\n\nThe museum can be allocated material from the railway industry by the Railway Heritage Committee. Because of the diversity of material falling potentially within the museum's collection policy and the problems of caring for it, decisions on acquisition of new items for the collection can be difficult. Previously the museum has treated rolling stock as if it were effectively still in railway service and capable of undergoing repeated heavy repairs and restoration. Since being preserved many of the museum's locomotives have operated on the main line, heritage railways or at the museum. More recently, there have been moves to less interventionist forms of conservation in some cases leading to some exhibits becoming non-operational.\n\nThe Museum's management of the protracted overhaul of LNER Class A3 4472 \"Flying Scotsman\" was heavily criticised in an internally commissioned report in 2012.\n\nSince 1977, the Friends of the National Railway Museum have been in existence as a group to give financial and other support to the museum, such as financing the original restoration to steam of \"Duchess of Hamilton\".\n\nThe 1990 \"Great Railway Show\" won the Museum of the Year award and in 2001 the museum gained the European Museum of the Year Award. It has also won White Rose awards from the Yorkshire Tourist Board, and in recognition of the several major developments in 2004 was given the Heritage Railway Association's Peter Manisty Award.\n\nThe National Railway Museum website offers a facility for visitors to plan their visit to the museum in advance. The museum also has a policy of improving access to its collections via its website. It has uploaded some of the recordings from the National Archive of Railway History to its website. It has also created an iPhone App in association with East Coast that allows people travelling between London and Edinburgh on the East Coast Main Line through York to view objects from the collection in connection with locations on the route. The museum's archives and library service Search Engine is increasingly making its collection accessible online by providing catalogues and lists for researchers to search before visiting and adding low resolution copies of its drawing online. The library collection can be searched through the University of York library catalogue. All of the museum's rolling stock and a large amount of other material has also been added to the website\n\nThe National Railway Museum also has a presence on a number of other websites. Copies of many of its posters, photographs and artworks can be ordered through the Science and Society Picture Library. The National Railway Museum has a presence on the National Preservation forums. Members and Readers are able to talk and comment directly to members of the staff. Providing both feedback and constructive criticism, a valuable source of information for the museum. Members of staff can usually answer questions when they are not busy and are part of the National Railway Museum group. National Railway Museum staff also publish a blog via WordPress.com where staff write stories about events behind the scenes in the museum such as conservation work or preparation for major events.\n\nThese are a few of the Museum's locomotives (listed by operational state, and then by date the design was introduced).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

German prisoner of war records confirm his residency in Florø but do not give any details of his date and place of birth. From September 1935 Fuglesang received three years education in economics at the French Lycee Pierre Corneille in Rouen before studying at the Bergen Commercial College. He was working as an apprentice with an Oslo shipping company when the war began.\nFollowing the German invasion in April 1940 and the ensuing battles the country was occupied. Fuglesang decided to escape from Norway to get to Great Britain and join the Norwegian Armed Forces in exile. Sea traffic was closely monitored by the Germans who were aware of significant numbers of young Norwegians wishing to continue the fight from England, frequent checks and searches were made and penalties harsh for anybody caught. On 12 March 1941 he escaped from Kyammen to Shetland aboard the boat \"Heimfjell\" with 11 others.\n\nFuglesang enlisted in the Norwegian Army Air Service with service number 742 and sailed in May to Canada to train at Little Norway, the exiled Norwegian forces camp at Toronto Island Airport. He completed basic training and learned more English language then completing flight training. \nHe was awarded his aircrew brevet pilots wings and promoted sergeant towards the end of 1941. His instructors recommended that had the aptitude to become a fighter pilot during which he was promoted to lieutenant. After further training Fuglesang sailed for England where he joined Operational Training Unit and began to fly Supermarine Spitfire aircraft.\nOn 9 June 1942 he joined No. 332 Squadron RAF a squadron manned by Norwegian personnel flying Supermarine Spitfire. at RAF North Weald flying operationally with the fighter wing commanded by wing commander Don Finlay which operated from that base. He flew on fighter sweep and bomber escort missions over the English Channel to occupied France and the Netherlands. In action on 20 January 1943 he attacked a German Fw 190 fighter over the French coast, this was assessed as probably destroyed. His reputation as a reliable and steady pilot resulted in him being awarded the Norwegian King Haakon VII Freedom Medal and a promotion to pilot officer in March 1943.\n\nAt 1905 hours on 2 May 1943 Nils Jørgen Fuglesang was flying Supermarine Spitfire Mark IX (serial number “BS540” squadron codes “AH-E”) on a Ramrod mission with North Weald wing over south west Holland. His squadron were in action with Luftwaffe Focke Wulf Fw 190 fighters and as wingman he stuck to the tail of his lead pilot until a burst of 20mm cannon fire intended for the lead aircraft hit his own aircraft. Fuglesang crash landed in Zeeland, the SW part of Holland and was taken prisoner by German infantrymen training close by. Photograph of his crashed aircraft is in Franks book. He became prisoner of war No. 1264 held at Stalag Luft III in the province of Lower Silesia near the town of Sagan (now Żagań in Poland).\n\nFuglesang was an enthusiastic member of the tunneling crew participating in regular shifts to lengthen and shore up the tunnel, he and fellow Norwegian Halldor Espelid were near the front of the list of men escaping and they had cleared the tunnel exit by 2230 hours.\nSo he was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as \"the Great Escape\". \nHe teamed up with fellow Free Norwegian Halldor Espelid, James Catanach an Australian who was fluent in German and spoke Norwegian and the New Zealander of Danish ancestry Arnold George Christensen in a group heading for Denmark and possibly ultimately neutral Sweden.\nFuglesang and his team reached Berlin as they were seen there by other escapers before they changed trains to Hamburg which they also reached successfully only to be caught on the next leg of their rail journey from Hamburg to the naval town of Flensburg on the Danish border. \nNearing the Danish border on 26 March 1944 a suspicious policemen insisted on carefully examining their papers and checking their briefcases which contained newspapers and escape rations. Close inspection of their clothing revealed they were wearing altered greatcoats. Although the four escapees had split up to pretend to be travelling individually they were all in the same railway carriage, more policemen arrived and closely examined every passenger, soon arresting all four suspects. An alternative version states that the two Norwegians were arrested on the Marienhelzungsweg and Catanach and Christensen on the Helm. The escapers were taken to Flensburg prison. \nThe four men were handed over to the Kiel Gestapo and after interrogation were told that they would be taken by road back to prison camp.\n\nOn 29 March 1944 two black sedan cars arrived, James Catanach was taken in the first car with three Gestapo agents including SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Johannes Post a senior officer based there. Post had his driver stop the car in the countryside outside Kiel about 1630 hours and called James Catanach out into a field where he promptly shot him. The second car drew up in the same place shortly afterwards and Post told his agents to get the hand-cuffed Arnold George Christensen, Halldor Espelid and Nils Fuglesang out, stating that they should take a break before their long drive. As the airmen walked into the field they almost stumbled over Catanach’s body as they were also shot. The four men were cremated at Kiel under Gestapo supervision.\n\nFuglesang was one of the 50 escapers who had been listed by SS-Gruppenfuhrer Arthur Nebe to be killed so was amongst the unfortunate executed and murdered by the \"Gestapo\". Originally his remains were buried at Sagan, but his cremation urn was removed to Kirkehavn Hidra near Flekkefjord, Norway for his family.\n\nThe Norwegians Nils Fuglesang and Halldor Espelid were on the list of officers named in the British press on 20 May 1944 as having been killed.\n\n\nThe \"Gestapo\" executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape. Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "340381", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=340381", "title": "Pig War (1859)", "text": "Pig War (1859)\n\nThe Pig War was a confrontation in 1859 between the United States and United Kingdom over the British–U.S. border in the San Juan Islands, between Vancouver Island and the mainland. The Pig War, so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a pig, is also called the Pig Episode, the Pig and Potato War, the San Juan Boundary Dispute or the Northwestern Boundary Dispute. With no shots exchanged and no human casualties, this dispute was a bloodless conflict.\n\nThe Oregon Treaty of June 15, 1846, resolved the Oregon boundary dispute by dividing the Oregon Country/Columbia District between the United States and Britain \"along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver Island, and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of the Strait of Juan de Fuca, to the Pacific Ocean.\"\n\nHowever, there are actually two straits that could be called the middle of the channel: Haro Strait, along the west side of the San Juan Islands; and Rosario Strait, along the east side.\n\nIn 1846, there was still some uncertainty about the geography of the region. The most commonly available maps were those of George Vancouver, published in 1798, and of Charles Wilkes, published in 1845. In both cases the maps are unclear in the vicinity of the southeastern coast of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. As a result, Haro Strait is not fully clear either.\n\nIn 1856, the US and Britain set up a Boundary Commission to resolve a number of issues regarding the international boundary, including the water boundary from the Strait of Georgia to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The British appointed James Charles Prevost First Commissioner, George Henry Richards Second Commissioner, and William A. G. Young Secretary. The US appointed Archibald Campbell First Commissioner, John Parke Second Commissioner, and William J. Warren Secretary. On June 27, 1857, the American and British commissioners met for the first time on board the British ship HMS \"Satellite\", anchored in Esquimalt Harbour. The two sides met several more times in 1857 in Esquimalt Harbour and Nanaimo Harbour, and corresponded by letter between meetings. The water boundary was discussed from October to December. From the start, Prevost maintained that Rosario Strait was required by the treaty's wording and was intended by the treaty framers, while Campbell had the same opinion for Haro Strait.\n\nPrevost held that the channel specified in the treaty must have three key qualities: \n\nOnly Rosario fulfilled these requirements, he wrote. Campbell countered that the expression \"southerly\", in the treaty, was to be understood in a general sense, that Rosario Strait did not separate the continent from Vancouver Island, but the San Juan Islands from Lummi Island, Cypress Island, Fidalgo Island, and others, and that navigability was not germane to the issue, but even if it was, Haro Strait was the wider and more direct passage. Finally he challenged Prevost to produce any evidence showing that the treaty framers had intended Rosario Strait. Prevost responded to the challenge by referring to American maps showing the boundary running through Rosario Strait, included one by John C. Frémont, produced for and published by the US government, and another by John B. Preston, Surveyor-General of Oregon in 1852. To the other points, Prevost repeated his statements about Rosario Strait's navigability—the channels between Lummi, Cypress, and Fidalgo islands not being navigable—and that a line through Rosario would be southerly, while one through Haro would have to be drawn westerly. The two continued to discuss the issue into December 1857, until it was clear what each side's argument was and that neither would be convinced of the other. Prevost made a final offer at the sixth meeting, December 3. He suggested a compromise line through San Juan Channel, which would give the US all the main islands except San Juan Island. This offer was rejected and the commission adjourned, agreeing to report back to their respective governments. Thus ambiguity over the water boundary remained.\n\nBecause of this ambiguity, both the United States and Britain claimed sovereignty over the San Juan Islands. During this period of disputed sovereignty, Britain's Hudson's Bay Company established operations on San Juan and turned the island into a sheep ranch. Meanwhile, by mid-1859, twenty-five to twenty-nine American settlers had arrived.\n\nSan Juan Island held significance not for its size, but as a military strategic point. While the British held Fort Victoria on Vancouver Island to the west, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the entry point to Haro Strait, leading to the Strait of Georgia, the nation that held the San Juan Islands would be able to dominate all the straits connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca with the Strait of Georgia.\n\nOn June 15, 1859, exactly thirteen years after the adoption of the Oregon Treaty, the ambiguity led to direct conflict. Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto San Juan Island claiming rights to live there under the Donation Land Claim Act, found a large black pig rooting in his garden.\nHe had found the pig eating his tubers. This was not the first occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company to run the sheep ranch. He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100. Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. (A probably apocryphal story claims Cutlar said to Griffin, \"It was eating my potatoes.\" Griffin replied, \"It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig.\") When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for military protection.\n\nBrigadier General William S. Harney, commanding the Department of Oregon, initially dispatched 66 American soldiers of the 9th Infantry under the command of Captain George Pickett to San Juan Island with orders to prevent the British from landing. Concerned that a squatter population of Americans would begin to occupy San Juan Island if the Americans were not kept in check, the British sent three warships under the command of Captain Geoffrey Hornby to counter the Americans. Pickett was famously quoted as saying defiantly, \"We'll make a Bunker Hill of it,\" placing him in the national limelight. The situation continued to escalate. By August 10, 1859, 461 Americans with 14 cannon under Colonel Silas Casey were opposed by five British warships mounting 70 guns and carrying 2,140 men. During this time, no shots were fired.\n\nThe governor of the Colony of Vancouver Island, James Douglas, ordered British Rear Admiral Robert L. Baynes to land marines on San Juan Island and engage the American soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Harney. (Harney's forces had occupied the island since July 27, 1859.) Baynes refused, deciding that \"two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig\" was foolish. Local commanding officers on both sides had been given essentially the same orders: defend yourselves, but absolutely do not fire the first shot. For several days, the British and U.S. soldiers exchanged insults, each side attempting to goad the other into firing the first shot, but discipline held on both sides, and thus no shots were fired.\n\nWhen news about the crisis reached Washington and London, officials from both nations were shocked and took action to calm the potentially explosive international incident.\n\nIn September, U.S. President James Buchanan sent General Winfield Scott to negotiate with Governor Douglas and resolve the growing crisis. This was in the best interest of the United States, as sectional tensions within the country were increasing, soon to culminate in the Civil War. Scott had calmed two other border crises between the two nations in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Douglas.\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final settlement could be reached, reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men. The \"English Camp\" was established on the north end of San Juan Island along the shoreline, for ease of supply and access; and the \"American Camp\" was created on the south end on a high, windswept meadow, suitable for artillery barrages against shipping. Today the Union Jack still flies above the \"English Camp\", being raised and lowered daily by park rangers, making it one of the few places without diplomatic status where U.S. government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country.\nDuring the years of joint military occupation, the small British and American units on San Juan Island had an amicable mutual social life, visiting one another's camps to celebrate their respective national holidays and holding various athletic competitions. Park rangers tell visitors the biggest threat to peace on the island during these years was \"the large amounts of alcohol available\".\n\nThis state of affairs continued for the next 12 years. The dispute was peacefully resolved after more than a decade of confrontation and military bluster, during which time the local British authorities consistently lobbied London to seize back the Puget Sound region entirely, as the Americans were busy elsewhere with the Civil War. In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the Colony of British Columbia to form an enlarged Colony of British Columbia. In 1871, the enlarged colony joined the newly formed Dominion of Canada. That year, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the Treaty of Washington, which dealt with various differences between the two nations, including border issues involving the newly formed Dominion. Among the results of the treaty was the decision to resolve the San Juan dispute by international arbitration, with German Emperor Wilhelm I chosen to act as arbitrator. Wilhelm referred the issue to a three-man arbitration commission which met in Geneva for nearly a year. On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States. The arbitrator chose the American-preferred marine boundary via Haro Strait, to the west of the islands, over the British preference for Rosario Strait which lay to their east.\nOn November 25, 1872, the British withdrew their Royal Marines from the British Camp. The Americans followed by July 1874.\n\nCanadian politicians and public, already angry with the Oregon Treaty, were once again upset that Britain had not looked after their interests, and Canada sought greater autonomy in international affairs.\n\nThe Pig War is commemorated in San Juan Island National Historical Park.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It occurs on the night of Good Friday, beginning at the El Carmen Church, where it originated, and winds through the streets of the historic center of the city of San Luis Potosí. During the event there are the sounds of drums and bugles, but no participant or spectator speaks, giving the event its name. It is one of the most important Holy Week observances in Mexico and was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of San Luis Potosí in 2013.\n\nOrganized by the Tradiciones Potosinas association, the procession commemorates as an act of mourning the Passion of Christ. It is a reenactment of the Stations of the Cross, with each station marked by a heavy platform with the relevant images. This procession if one of the most important Holy Week observances in Mexico, one of the most important religious event for the state of San Luis Potosí and emblematic for the city. It is also a major tourist event, attractive over 160,000 visitors to the city, with about fifteen percent coming from outside of Mexico.\n\nThe procession takes place on Good Friday, in the historical center of the city of San Luis Potosi, which is filled with churches and colonial era buildings. Illuminated with candles, the area has a church-like atmosphere and even though thousands of spectators line the streets, no one will speak during the hours of the procession, which gives it the name.\n\nThe main participants of the procession are the members of various religious brotherhoods, who carry and accompany large platforms with religious images through the streets. In 2013, there were thirty such brotherhoods which included the Cofradía del Virgen del Carmen, the Cofradía del Santo Entierro, Cofradía del Descendimiento, Cofradía del Ecce Homo and the Cofradía de la Soledad, which carries an image of Our Lady of Solitude. The members of the various brotherhoods are identified by the colors of their garments, which identified their home parish and shows the influence of the processions of Seville. The most noticeable participants are the costaleros, which were a special tunic and pointed hoods with cloths covering the faces. The brotherhoods participate as a form of penance, with faces covered and some even walking with chains attached to their ankles. Other participants include adults and children in various dress which include altar boys, Nazarenes, Our Lady of Macarena, Roman soldiers, women wearing traditional Potosi rebozos and carrying candles, bullfighters, politicians and artists.\n\nThe procession begins at the El Carmen Church at exactly 8pm. The sound of a bugle summons the Praetorian Guard which marches from the Teatro de la Paz to the El Carmen Church. The centurian knocks three times at the main door and the bugler on horseback clears the way and silences the crowd for the procession. The procession contains hundreds of people and begins by crossing the Plaza del Carmen in front of the church. Just this portion of the procession takes two hours. The entire event lasts over four hours and winds its way along the main streets of the historic center, passing landmarks such as the Mask Museum, the Government Palace the main city plaza and the cathedral over 3.5 km. The main focal points are the platforms carried by members of the brotherhoods, which can weigh up to 500 kilograms, which bear religious images adorned with fresh flowers. Some of the platforms have been made by local artisans and others imported from Seville, Spain. The participants walk slowly and solemnly, with the pace measured by drumbeats. At certain points in the procession, trumpets are sounded. There are twenty three main platform, with the end of the procession marked by that dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude. This image is ornate Baroque and created by Manuel Tolsá. and wears a Seville style cloak.\nThe procession is the highlight of two weeks of activities related to Holy Week, which include those of religious, cultural and sporting nature, beginning on the Viernes de Dolores, the Friday before Palm Sunday. On this day, crowds gather on a small alley called Callejón del Buche to create altars dedicated to the Virgin Mary as Our Lady of Sorrows. During the rest of the week more altars are assembled depicting the various Stations of the Cross, with some of these destined to be carried during the Good Friday procession.\n\nPalm Sunday is marked with a simple procession to the city cathedral for the blessing of palms. On Maundy Thursday, there is another procession with seven platforms that visit the various main neighborhoods of the city and their main churches. In the churches, the images of saints are covered on purple cloths as a sign of mourning, bread is distributed to remember the Last Supper and sprigs of chamomile are blessed. During the day on Good Friday, the main event is a reenactment of the crucifixion in the San Juan de Guadalupe neighborhood, and on Holy Saturday, the Burning of Judas occurs on the Plaza de los Fundadores.\n\nThe Holy Week season stretches for two weeks and various secular events are sponsored by government and private entities during this time. These include art exhibitions, concerts, conferences, guided tours and volleyball and basketball tournaments. They also include a half marathon between Venado and Charcas and a national youth tennis tournament.\n\nThe modern event has its origins in the traditions of processions during Holy Week established in New Spain early in the colonial period, which included the hiding of the faces of participants. The first procession of silence was instituted by the Carmelites in Mexico City.\n\nHowever, this particular procession was officially established in 1954. At this time, bullfighters Fermín Rivera, Carmelite priest Nicolás de San José and others began a small event to enact the Stations of the Cross and pay homage to Our Lady of Solitude by the guild of bullfighters at the El Carmen church. It is based on the annual procession in Seville, Spain in honor of Our Lady of Macarena, although this version is dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude, because of the devotion of the bullfighters to this image of the Virgin Mary.\n\nToday, it is the only procession in Mexico to include altars depicting all stations of the cross. It was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of San Luis Potosí in 2013 as well as the most important civic and religious event of the state. In 2014, the city paid homage to the founders of the modern event, including Fermín Rivera, María de los Ángeles Agüero Ereño, Marco Tulio Jiménez, Carlos Artolózaga Noriega and Juan Hernández Auces. \n"}

Belgium has been reported as being one of the countries with the highest rate of rape.\n\nRape in Belgium is defined by Article 375 of the Penal Code as \"any act of sexual penetration, of whatever sort and by whatever means, committed on a non-consenting person\". Marital rape is also illegal under this law.\n\nApart from criminal proceedings, committing marital rape has also consequences in a divorce case. The new amendments to the Civil Code regulating marriage and divorce, that came into effect in September 2007, state that any of the spouses, following a divorce, may receive alimony if they need the money, but a spouse who has committed rape or other violent crimes against the other spouse cannot receive alimony. Article 301 reads: The court may refuse to grant the application for a alimony if the defendant proves that the applicant has committed a serious offense that rendered it impossible to continue living together. Under no circumstances will alimony be given to a spouse who was found guilty of an act referred to in Articles 375, 398-400, 402, 403 or 405 of the Penal Code, committed against the person of the defendant, or an attempt to commit an act referred to in Articles 375, 393, 394 or 397 of the Code against the same person.\n\nIn 2011, Belgian Institute for the Equality of Women and Men published a report on \"Women and men in Belgium\", which noted that in 2008, according to police report, 87% of victims of rape (89% for collective rape) were female. The survey, carried out by Belgian Institute and titled \"Experience of men and women in gender based violence\", included the following figures;\n\nAccording to \"De Morgen\", from 2009 and 2011 the number of reported rape cases increased from 3,360 to 4,038, an increase of more than 20 percent.\n\nAccording to a report by \"De Standaard\", the sentences for rape is considerably lower than it is usually expected. For example, a person who had raped his 13-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to 2.5 years. In another case, the criminal was sentenced to two years for repeated rape of two girls younger than 15; one of the victims was pregnant.\n\n"}

The regatta takes place on Saturday and Sunday in June and its importance stems from its date, being immediately before entries close for Henley Royal Regatta.\n\nReading Amateur Regatta was established in 1842 although it had a chequered history until the 1870s, when Reading Rowing Club was founded and revived interest in it. Its re-establishment was also encouraged by the founding of the Reading Working Men's Regatta on the lower lock reach above Sonning Lock in 1877.\n\nAnother hiatus occurred after World War I, but thenceforth the regatta grew from strength to strength requiring various adaptations to accommodate the entry level. This resulted in a review in 1999 which saw two-lane racing reintroduced on a 1500 metres course by changing from launch to bank umpiring. An ironical conclusion perhaps as in 1844 a ferryman had spent four months in Reading Gaol for attacking an umpire and tipping him into the river with a punt pole in retaliation for disqualification in the previous year's regatta.\n\n\n"}

The series existed between 1994 and 2002 the series was revived for 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Spec Racer Ford was introduced in 1994 after Renault pulled out of the Spec Racer project. SCCA Pro Racing introduced the pro series soon after Ford wanted to support the Spec Racer. The first season saw fields of around 25 cars. David Tenney won the first ever Spec Racer Ford Pro Series race on July 2, 1994 at the Des Moines Street Circuit. Tenney won the race after a lengthy battle for the lead with Keith Scharf. The second race at Watkins Glen International marked the first win of many for Warren Stillwell, who would win numerous races in Spec Racer Ford classes. Stillwell took the inaugural championship with one race left in the championship. Keith Scharf finished second in the championship followed by Bob Boudinot.\n\nWarrenn Stillwell repeated his championship in 1995 again taking the championship one race early.\n\nFor the 1996 season the fields exploded, 55 cars were entered in the first race, only 45 could start. The 1994 and 1995 seasons saw only 5 races on the calendar, two races were added for 1996. Many drivers were in fact amateur racers making their pro racing debut. The sheer number of cars in combination with a street circuit resulted in 18 cars crashing at the Grand Prix of Minnesota. James Goughary Jr. won the race and went on to win the championship with Keith Scharf finishing second and Warren Stillwell finishing third in the championship.\n\nThe following season, 1997, saw nine races on the calendar including 2 double-headers. Stillwell retook the crown, winning four races. He was closely followed by Robert Mumm, only 2 points made the difference in the end. The races were not very tense, only 11 lead changes throughout the season with 6 races seeing no lead changes. The sixth round of the championship at Heartland Park was an exception with 7 lead changes. There were only 0.210 seconds between the winning driver (Robbert Mumm) and the number two (Leo Capaldi), with Stillwell finishing third.\n\nFor 1998 the SCCA Pro Racing shortened the calendar to 7 races. The championship was decided in the final round. At the final round the Spec Racer Ford Pro Series supported the FIA GT World Schampionships at Homestead-Miami Speedway. Going in the final round John Strickler had scored 96 points and Stillwell 93. Qualifying was close with Strickler on pole position and Stillwell starting fourth. During the race Stillwell crashed in the 11th round and Strickler went on to win the race and the championship.\n\n1999 saw again large fields with an average of 36 cars per race. Jack Willes decided the championship in the prefinal round at Watkins Glen International. The battle for the second place in the championship was tight. This was decided during the final round at Sebring International Raceway. With Goughary, Jr. and Tilbor competing for second place. Goughary finished third, in front of Tilbor who was fourth, thus winning the second place in the championship.\n\nWith fields still as large as before and relative rookies competing for top honors the series was still going strong into the new millennium. Stillwell decided the championship, in his signature style, one race early. New in the top three were second placed Bobby Sak and third placed John Black.\n\nIn its eighth season, in 2001, the series supported the Trans-Am Series, SCCA World Challenge and the NASCAR Winston Cup Series at Sears Point Raceway. Keith Scharf took the title after nine rounds of racing. Stillwell was on course to win his fifth title, but he lost valuable points when he had to sit out round five. Round five was the only oval racing event on the calendar. At Chicago Motor Speedway, supporting the ASA National Tour, only 17 cars started the race. Scharf started from pole and won the 50 lap race, thus gaining points on championship fore runners Stillwell and Goughary Jr. who did not start the race. Scharf did not finish outside the top six and took his first title.\n\nStillwell retook the title in 2002, winning three races and capturing seven podium finishes out of ten races.\n\nFor the 2003 season the series was split up in an Atlantic Tour and a Pacific Tour. But instead of creating a series where drivers from the whole country could compete for the title, fields were split in half. May 20, 2003 SCCA Pro Racing canceled the remainder of the Atlantic and Pacific Tours. Shawn Morrison was the last driver to win a Pro Spec Racer event.\n\nThe Spec Racer Ford Pro Series was revived by the SCCA in 2010. The series was launched together with the SCCA Pro Formula Enterprises. In the new racing format every race-weekend features two races. 57 drivers entered the first race at Road Atlanta. Of the 52 drivers who started the race, Brian Schofield finished first with a margin of 0.145 seconds over Tray Ayres. For the second raceweekend, at Thunderbolt Raceway, fields were drastically smaller with 18 cars on the grid. Scott Rettich took his first Pro Spec Racer win. A record low competitor count was achieved at Brainerd International Raceway, only 12 drivers joined the grid. After ten races Rettich took the title with five point separating him from the number two Ayres.\n\nThe series was renewed for a second season in 2011. The season would be a disappointing one from an organizer point of view. The largest field was at the Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières with 21 cars, the smallest however was just five cars at the season finale at Road Atlanta. Tray Ayres would win, what would be the last, Pro SRF race. Rettich won three races and won the championship. SRF veteran Richard Spicer won four races, but had less podium finishes, thus he finished second in the standings.\n\nFive days after the last race of the season, SCCA Pro Racing announced that the Pro Spec Ford and the Pro Formula Enterprises would not return in 2012. The organisation stated that the series was not viable in the current economic environment.\n\nThe Spec Racer Ford is an open cockpit sportsracer produced by SCCA Enterprises. The car features a 1.9L Ford Escort engine in the rear. The engine is an inline-4 SOHC with 8 valves with a Hemi head. The engine produces 105 horsepower.\n\nThe car has a tube frame chassis. The bodywork is made out of fiberglass. The gearbox is a transaxle type and features five forward speeds and one reverse.\n\n This reflects the standings at the date of cancellation, these standings are not official.\n\n These events were canceled after the series cancelation. <br>\n\n\n"}

The film was shot on location in Tasmania and Sydney between April and May 2008.\n\nThe film was nominated for the 2010 Rose d'Or, Best Drama at the 6th Annual Irish Film and Television Awards, Best Drama at the 2009 Australian Film Institute Awards, won Best Documentary at the 2009 Inside Film Awards and the director Michael James Rowland was nominated in the Best Director (Telemovie) category in the 2009 Australian Directors Guild Awards.\n\nThe film follows the final days of Irish convict and bushranger Alexander Pearce's life as he awaits execution. In 1824 the British penal colony of Van Diemen's Land is little more than a living hell. Chained to a wall in the darkness of a cell under Hobart Gaol, Pearce is visited by Father Philip Conolly, the parish priest of the fledgling colony and a fellow Irishman. Pearce wishes to tell the priest his recollection of the horrors he endured in the three months spent traversing the brutal wilderness of Van Diemen's Land. Conolly struggles to reconcile his desire to grant absolution to the convict with the story Pearce tells him. The title of the film comes from the remarkable interaction between Philip Conolly and Alexander Pearce days before Pearce is executed. \"The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce\" is presented as a psychoanalytical historical epic.\n\nThe relatively underscored aspect of Pearce's crime and confessions is the murder of fellow escapees and the alleged cannibalism.\n\nThe film details the convict's relinquishing psyche as he finds himself succumbing to the inevitability of his imminent execution. For much of the film, the complex relationship between Pearce and Conolly is examined. The circumstances and motives of Pearce's execution are, too, put into question by Rowland.\n\nProducer and co-writer Nial Fulton began developing \"The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce\" in Ireland in 1998 and production began on the project in Australia in the summer of 2006. The film was commissioned and financed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, RTÉ, BBC Northern Ireland, Screen Australia and Screen Tasmania.\n\n\"The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce\" was inspired by the true story of an escape from the infamous Sarah Island penal settlement in Macquarie Harbour, Van Diemen's Land in 1822 by Irish convict and bushranger Alexander Pearce and the subsequent confession he made to the Hobart priest Phillip Conolly days before he was executed for the murder of fellow convict Thomas Cox.\n\nWritten by Michael James Rowland and Nial Fulton, the script draws on all four confessions made by Alexander Pearce, but principally on the confessions he made to Commandant John Cuthbertson and the final confession made to the priest Phillip Conolly. In many places the script uses the exact words written down in these confessions.\n\n\nShot over five weeks on location in Tasmania and Sydney in 2008, the film used locations around Derwent Bridge, Lake St Clair, Nelson Falls, the Huon Valley, Mount Wellington and Callan Park, a former asylum in Rozelle. Many of the filming locations were selected as they were places Alexander Pearce may have passed through on his escape from Sarah Island.\n\n\"The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce\" received positive reviews internationally from film critics.\n\n\n\"Empire Magazine\", \"The Sunday Times\" and the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" all gave the film 4/5 stars.\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in 2004 by record label Epic as the first single from their seventh studio album, \"Lifeblood\".\n\nThe song is, according to the band, \"a soundtrack to disillusion, hatred, love and never giving up\". More specifically, the song is a sympathetic appraisal of former US president Richard Nixon and mentions some of his positive achievements, inevitably overshadowed by the Watergate Scandal. The timing of the single's release, two weeks before George W. Bush's victory at the 2004 US presidential elections, can also be seen as a statement by the band concerning the reputation of the USA's leadership at the time.\nIn an interview with Repeat Fanzine, the band also said it represents how they feel in comparison to Radiohead. Nicky in particular commented that they feel like Richard Nixon compared to Radiohead's John F. Kennedy: \"'If Radiohead are Kennedy, then Manic Street Preachers are Nixon: the ugly duckling who had to try 10 times harder than anyone else.

The Ball is organized by Board of Directors, under President Silvia Frieser and Artistic Director Daniel Serafin.\n\nDignitaries, Diplomats and Debutantes “Open” the international Ball, long regarded as one of New York City’s “greatest annual events,” garnering worldwide media coverage for over five decades. There is nothing formulaic about the event; with four generations of guests, the Ball reflects the universal appeal of Austria’s cultural and culinary treasures. The gala evening features Opera, Classical Music and Ballroom Dancing including, of course, Waltzing. One popular highlight is the Midnight Quadrille, conducted by a Viennese choreographer. Following an 8 p.m. champagne reception, the Ball runs from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., and includes a four-course dinner service. The “Tanz Bar” (post-Ball party) follows from 1:00 to 4:00 a.m. and includes a full buffet supper with the Viennese Opera Ball's Signature Goulash Soup, as well as multiple venues featuring: live dance music, a DJ and a Vienna Coffee House with Viennese pastries.\n\nThe Ball opens with the Grand March of Dignitaries and Diplomats. The ceremonial tone of the Ball Opening continues with the Presentation and Posting of the Flags by a West Point Color Guard. The Program continues with the Presentation of Debutantes (ages 16 to 26) and their dance Escorts (ages 18–30). A choreographed waltz routine by young ballroom dance couples (ages 18–30) is followed by a call for \"Alles Walzer!\" (Everyone Dance!) and guests join the dancers for the first official waltz of the Ball. A Viennese Orchestra plays continuous dance music throughout the Ball, stopping only for Program highlights or performances by the featured Opera singers.\n\nThe Viennese Opera Ball in New York takes its inspiration from the famous Vienna Opera Ball in Austria, but it is an American 501(c)(3) non-profit association, and independent from the Vienna Opera Ball. In February 2018 the ball celebrated its 63rd Anniversary.\n\nThe ball normally takes place on the first Friday in February at the Waldorf Astoria in Manhattan. In 2018 the ball was held at the Ziegfeld Ballroom as the Waldorf Astoria is closed for renovations. It is considered one of the few 'white-tie' balls still in existence in the United States, i.e. the gentlemen come attired in white tie and dress coats with decorations and the ladies wear long floor-length ball gowns with decorations and opera gloves.\n\nDebutantes and their male partners (called Escorts) rehearse for one week prior to the ball, and they are generally selected by recommendation from Committee members each year. The choreographed Waltzers rehearse for three months prior to the ball, and they are selected from dance auditions held by the Choreographer each year. Opera singers come from the Metropolitan Opera, and ballet dancers are flown over from Vienna. The Debutante procession is typically led by either the reigning Miss USA or the reigning Miss Universe.\n\nEach year there is a different theme: 2005 -- 'Golden Jubilee' (in honor of the 50th anniversary of both the Ball and Free Austria); 2006 -- 'Mozart,' as the night of the ball fell on what would have been Mozart's 250th birthday; 2007 -- \"Cinderella\", complete with a ballet following the story of Cinderella and her night at \"the ball\" with Prince Charming; 2008 -- \"Fairy Doll\", inspired by composer Josef Bayer's children's tale; and, 2009 -- \"Masked Night at the Opera\", inspired by Strauss's \"Prince Orlofsky's masked ball at his \"villa\" in \"Die Fledermaus\".

{"id": "33171", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33171", "title": "War film", "text": "War film\n\nWar film is a film genre concerned with warfare, typically about naval, air, or land battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century. The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them. Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the Second World War. The stories told may be fiction, historical drama, or biographical. Critics have noted similarities between the Western and the war film.\n\nNations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.\n\nSubgenres, not necessarily distinct, include anti-war, comedy, animated, propaganda, and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or Vietnam; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, in submarines, or at prisoner of war camps.\n\nThe war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the American Film Institute, for example, speaks of \"films to grapple with the Great War\" without attempting to classify these. However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director Sam Fuller defined the genre by saying that \"a war film’s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war.\" John Belton identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of Hollywood production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.\nThe film critic Stephen Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the American Civil War or the American Indian Wars of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War. The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the Western, but that in practice, \"successful and influential\" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing. The film scholar Kathryn Kane points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame World War II as a conflict between \"good\" and \"evil\" as represented by the Allied forces and Nazi Germany whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples. James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like Sam Peckinpah's \"The Wild Bunch\" and \"war-movie escapades\" like \"The Dirty Dozen\".\n\nFilm historian Jeanine Basinger states that she began with a preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that\n\nFurther, Basinger considers \"Bataan\" to provide a definition-by-example of \"the World War II combat film\", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of \"hastily assembled volunteers\" hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their \"bravery and tenacity\". She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that lie on the margins of being war films. However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal \"with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)\" Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which \"determines the fate of the principal characters\". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films. Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's Oscar-winning \"Glory\" (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about that war which he considers \"notable\".\n\nThe military historian Antony Beevor \"despair[s]\" at how film-makers from America and Britain \"play fast and loose with the facts\", yet imply that \"their version is as good as the truth.\" For example, he calls the 2000 American film \"U-571\" a \"shameless deception\" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war. He is equally critical of Christopher Nolan's 2017 film \"Dunkirk\" with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by the \"little ships\". Beevor feels, however, that European film-makers are often \"far more scrupulous\"; for example, in his view the 2004 German film \"Downfall\" accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker, and he considers the 1965 French film \"The 317th Platoon\", set in Vietnam, \"the greatest war movie ever made.\" The 1966 film \"The Battle of Algiers\" is, he argues, a close second.\n\nThe costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was D.W. Griffith's 1910 silent picture, \"The Fugitive\". Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, \"Glory\", about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men. Some films such as \"Gettysburg\" focused on a single battle during the war, or even on a single incident, like the French short film, \"La Rivière du Hibou\" (\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\"). Others like the 1993 miniseries \"North and South\" spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as \"The Red Badge of Courage\" (1951), or \"Shenandoah\" (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population. Ken Burns's \"The Civil War\" is the most watched documentary in the history of PBS.\n\nThe first war films come from the Spanish–American War of 1898. Short \"actualities\" – documentary film-clips – included \"Burial of the Maine Victims\", \"Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit\", and \"Soldiers Washing Dishes\". These non-combat films were accompanied by \"reenactments\" of fighting, such as of Theodore Roosevelt's \"Rough Riders\" in action against the Spanish, staged in the United States.\n\nDuring the First World War, many films were made about life in the war. Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers, Albert K. Dawson: \"The Battle and Fall of Przemysl\" (1915), depicting the Siege of Przemyśl, disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras. The 1915 Australian film \"Within Our Gates\" (also known as \"Deeds that Won Gallipoli\") by Frank Harvey was described by the \"Motion Picture News\" as \"a really good war story, which is exceptional\".\n\nThe 1916 British film \"The Battle of the Somme\", by two official cinematographers, Geoffrey Malins and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what trench warfare was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact. It was watched by some 20 million people in Britain in its six weeks of exhibition, making it what the critic Francine Stock called \"one of the most successful films of all time\".\n\nWilliam A. Wellman's \"Wings\" (1927), about the First World War, was the first film (in any genre), and the only silent film, to win an Oscar for best picture. Later films of varied genres that deal with the First World War include David Lean's \"colossal epic\", both war film and biopic \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), shot in the then unfamiliar and exciting 70mm Technicolor, and described by Steven Spielberg as \"maybe the greatest screenplay ever written for the motion-picture medium\"; Richard Attenborough's satirical anti-war musical comedy based on Joan Littlewood's play of the same name, \"Oh! What a Lovely War\" (1969); and Spielberg's war drama \"War Horse\" (2011) based on Michael Morpurgo's children's novel of the same name.\n\nThe Spanish Civil War has attracted directors from different countries. Sam Wood's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" (1943), based on Ernest Hemingway's book of the same name, portrays the fated romance between an American played by Gary Cooper and a partisan played by Ingrid Bergman against the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168 minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a \"beautiful\" orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics. Alain Resnais's \"Guernica\" (1950) uses Picasso's \"painting\" to protest against war. Carlos Saura's \"La Caza\" (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish fascism. It won the Silver Bear for Best Director at the 16th Berlin International Film Festival in 1966. Ken Loach's \"Land and Freedom\" (\"Tierra y Libertad\", 1995), loosely based on George Orwell's \"Homage to Catalonia\", follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.\n\nSamuel Fuller’s \"The Steel Helmet\" (1951) was made during the Korean War (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct of the war, as did later films like \"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\" (1954) and \"Pork Chop Hill\" (1959). Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers of \"the only war we have lost\".\n\nIn 1955, after the fighting, the successful South Korean action film \"Piagol\" about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. Censorship loosened in the 1980s. \"The Taebaek Mountains\" (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for the communists, while \"Silver Stallion\" (1991) and \"Spring in My Hometown\" (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films \"Shiri\" (1999) and \"Joint Security Area\" (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.\n\nFilms in North Korea were made by government film studios and had clear political messages. The first was \"My Home Village\" (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of Kim Il Sung without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is \"to portray North Korea as a country under siege\", and that since the U.S. and its \"puppet\" South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.\n\nGillo Pontecorvo's dramatic \"The Battle of Algiers\" ((; ; ), 1966) portrayed events in the Algerian War (1954–1956). It was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel style of Italian neorealism, and even-handedly depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. It was attacked by French critics and was for five years banned in France.\n\nFew films before the late 1970s about the Vietnam War actually depicted combat. The exceptions included \"The Green Berets\" (1968). Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War, making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.\n\nFrom the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated included Michael Cimino's \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), and Francis Ford Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979). With the shift in American politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films such as Oliver Stone's \"Platoon\" (1986), Stanley Kubrick's \"Full Metal Jacket\" (1987) and John Irvin's \"Hamburger Hill\" (1987).\n\nThe Vietnamese director 's \"\" (\"Cánh đồng hoang\", 1979) gives an \"unnerving and compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view\" of life under helicopter fire in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American) \"helicopter-eye view\", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness seen earlier.\n\nDino Mustafić's \"Remake\" (2003), written by Zlatko Topčić, tells the parallel coming-of-age stories of a father living in Sarajevo during World War II and his son living through the Siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian War. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own life.\n\nThe first popular Allied war films made during the Second World War came from Britain and combined the functions of documentary and propaganda. Films such as \"The Lion Has Wings\" and \"Target for Tonight\" were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The British film industry began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like Noël Coward and David Lean's \"In Which We Serve\" (1942) – \"the most successful British film of the war years\", \"Millions Like Us\" (1943), and \"The Way Ahead\" (1944).\nIn America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the \"Why We Fight\" propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including John Huston's \"The Battle of San Pietro\". Hollywood made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), which portrayed a British family on the home front; \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters, and \"The North Star\" (1943) showed the Soviet Union and its Communist Party. Towards the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as \"Guadalcanal Diary\" (1943), Mervyn LeRoy's \"Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo\" (1944), and John Ford's \"They Were Expendable\" (1945).\nThe Russians, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary \"Moscow Strikes Back\" (, literally \"The rout of the German troops near Moscow\"), was made during the Battle of Moscow between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in Red Square and Stalin's speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best documentary. Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to Stalingrad early in 1943 to record \"the spectacle which greeted the Russian soldiers\" – the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the Voropovono camp by the German Sixth Army, defeated in the Battle of Stalingrad.\n\nFeature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship and were not always realistic. One of the first to attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for \"gritty realism\", was Tay Garnett's \"Bataan\" (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the \"worst image for stark violence\" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.\n\nThe Axis powers similarly made films during the Second World War, for propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the army high command brought out \"Sieg im Westen\" (\"Victory in the West\", 1941). Other Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with \"Kolberg\" (1945), which depicts stubborn Prussian resistance in the Siege of Kolberg (1807) to the invading French troops under Napoleon. The propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the siege.\n\nFor Japan, the war began with the undeclared war and invasion of China in 1937, which the Japanese authorities called \"The China Incident\". The government dispatched a \"pen brigade\" to write and film the action in China with \"humanist values\". Tomotaka Tasaka's \"Mud and Soldiers\" (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, Kōzaburō Yoshimura's \"Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi\", and Sato Takeshi's \"Chocolate and Soldiers\" (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely. Once war with the United States was declared, the Japanese conflict became known as the Pacific War. Japanese film critics worried that even with Western film techniques, their film output failed to represent native Japanese values. The historian John Dower found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as \"losers do not get reruns\", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought \"Chocolate and Soldiers\" unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not samurai, calmly devoted to his men and his country. These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the \"cultural enemy\". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and \"what mattered was not whom one fought but how well\". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an \"innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people\". Dower comments that the perversity of this image \"is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others.\"\n\nAccording to Andrew Pulver of \"The Guardian\", the public fascination with war films became an \"obsession\", with over 200 war films produced in each decade of the 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s. Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of Charles Frend's \"The Cruel Sea\" (1953). Like others of the period, \"The Cruel Sea\" was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like \"The Dam Busters\" (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. \"The Dam Busters\" became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an \"exclusively British [victory]\", it failed to break into the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955-58 period in particular. In 1957 alone, \"Bitter Victory\", \"Count Five and Die\", \"The Enemy Below\", \"Ill Met by Moonlight\", \"Men in War\", \"The One That Got Away\" and \"Seven Thunders\", and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and \"Paths of Glory\" were released. Some, such as \"Bitter Victory\", focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\" brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By the end of the decade the \" sense of shared achievement\" which had been common in war films \"began to evaporate\", according to Pulver.\n\nHollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" (1949) starring John Wayne. U.S. Marines considered \"Sands of Iwo Jima\" visually authentic, but found Lewis Milestone's \"Battle Cry\" (1955), with its attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film. The formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died. Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group should contain \"an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, \"Iowa\" or \"Dakota\"), and a character who must be initiated in some way\". Films based on real commando missions, like \"The Gift Horse\" (1952) based on the St. Nazaire Raid, and \"Ill Met by Moonlight\" (1956) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as \"The Guns of Navarone\" (1961), \"The Train\" (1964) and \"Where Eagles Dare\" (1968). These used the war as a backdrop for spectacular action.\n\nDarryl F. Zanuck produced the 178 minute documentary drama \"The Longest Day\" (1962), based on the first day of the D-Day landings, achieving commercial success and Oscars. It was followed by large-scale but thoughtful films like Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Ivan's Childhood\" (1962), and quasi-documentary all-star epics filmed in Europe such as \"Battle of the Bulge\" (1965), \"Battle of Britain\" (1969), \"The Battle of Neretva\" (1969), \"Midway\" (1976) and \"A Bridge Too Far\" (1977). In Lawrence Suid's view, \"The Longest Day\" \"served as the model for all subsequent combat spectaculars\". However, its cost also made it the last of the traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the U.S. Army and Zanuck's \"disregard for Pentagon relations\" changed the way that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.\n\nZanuck, by then an executive at 20th Century Fox, set up an American-Japanese co-production for Richard Fleischer's \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\" (1970) to depict what \"really happened on December 7, 1941\" in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The film, panned by Roger Ebert and \"The New York Times\", was a major success in Japan. Its realistic-looking attack footage was reused in later films such as \"Midway\" (1976), \"The Final Countdown\" (1980), and \"Australia\" (2008). \nThe story was revisited in \"Pearl Harbor\" (2001), described by \"The New York Times\" as a \"noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster\", with the comment that \"for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture\".\nSteven Spielberg's \"Saving Private Ryan\" (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound design, staging and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film historian Stuart Bender calls \"reported realism\", whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic. Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as \"groundbreaking and anti-generic\", with, in James Wolcott's words, a \"desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time\"; and that combat films have always been \"grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war\". Its success revived interest in World War II films. Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in Joseph Vilsmaier's \"Stalingrad\" (1993), which \"The New York Times\" said \"goes about as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter.\"\n\nMany war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's military forces. Since the Second World War, the United States Navy has provided ships and technical guidance for films such as \"Top Gun\". The U.S. Air Force assisted with \"The Big Lift\", \"Strategic Air Command\" and \"A Gathering of Eagles\", which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles. Critics have argued that the film \"Pearl Harbor\"'s US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier. In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of \"Crimson Tide\", especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance. The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films \"have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions\".\n\nThe first Chinese war films were newsreels like \"Battle of Wuhan\" (1911) and \"Battle of Shanghai\" (1913). Still in films such as Xu Xinfu's \"Battle Exploits\" (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as Shi Dongshan's \"Protect Our Land\" (1938) The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as Cheng Yin's \"From Victory to Victory\" (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same period is Xie Jin's The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale commercial films include Lu Chuan's \"City of Life and Death\" (2009). Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the Nanking massacre (1937–1938), with films such as the political melodrama \"Massacre in Nanjing\", Mou Tun Fei's docudrama \"\", and the \"contrived Sino–Japanese romance\" \"Don't Cry, Nanking\". Zhang Yimou's epic Chinese film \"Flowers of War\" (2011), based on Geling Yan's novel, portrays the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.\n\nMany Indonesian films deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the Japanese during the Second World War. Teguh Karya's \"Doea Tanda Mata\" (\"Mementos\", literally \"Two Eye Marks\", 1985) covers the limited nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s. A third group of films such as \"Enam Djam di Jogja\" (\"Six Hours in Yogyakarta\", 1951) and \"Serangan Fajar\" (\"Attack at Dawn\", 1983) covers the Indonesian war of independence (1945–1949). Two other films about the same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese Long March: Usmar Ismail's \"Darah dan Doa\" (\"The Long March\", literally \"Blood and Prayer\", 1950) and \"Mereka Kembali\" (\"They Return\", 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own time.\n\nThe more recent \"Merdeka\" (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with \"Merah Putih\" (\"Red and White\", the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.\n\nKarya's \"November 1828\" (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for independence through historical drama about the Java or Diponegoro War (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the Dutch. Deanne Schultz considered it \"a valuable interpretation\" of Indonesian history that \"embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema.\" It was the first Indonesian film to become well-known internationally.\n\nWar has been Russian cinema's major genre, becoming known indeed as the \"cinema front\", and its war films ranged from grim portrayals of atrocities to sentimental and even quietly subversive accounts. Leonid Lukov's popular and \"beautiful\" \"Two Warriors\" (1943) depicted two stereotypical Soviet soldiers, a quiet Russian and an extrovert southerner from Odessa, singing in his dugout.\n\nThe many Russian films about the Second World War include both large-scale epics such as Yury Ozerov's \"Battle of Moscow\" (1985) and Mikhail Kalatozov's more psychological \"The Cranes are Flying\" (1957) on the cruel effects of war; it won the 1958 Palme d'Or at Cannes.\n\nJapanese directors have made popular films such as \"Submarine I-57 Will Not Surrender\" (1959), \"Battle of Okinawa\" (1971) and \"Japan's Longest Day\" (1967) from a Japanese perspective. These \"generally fail to explain the cause of the war\". In the decades immediately after the Second World War, Japanese films often focused on human tragedy rather than combat, such as \"The Burmese Harp\" (1956), Fires on the Plain, (1959). From the late 1990s, films started to take a positive view of the war and of Japanese actions. These nationalistic films, including \"Pride\" (1998), \"Merdeka 17805\" (2001), and \"The Truth about Nanjing\" (2007), have emphasized positive traits of the Japanese military and contended that the Japanese were victims of post-war vindictiveness and viciousness. Such films have, however, drawn protest for revisionism. \"The Eternal Zero\" (2013) narrates the tale of a Zero fighter pilot who is considered a coward by his comrades, as he returns alive from his missions. It broke the record takings for a Japanese live action film, and won the Golden Mulberry at the Udine Far East Film Festival, but was criticised for its nationalistic sympathy with kamikaze pilots.\n\nThe wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide variety of documentary films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda. Newsreels, ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised. More recently, in the Iran–Iraq War, Morteza Avini's \"Ravayat-e Fath\" (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.\n\nSergei Eisenstein's 1938 historical drama \"Alexander Nevsky\" depicts Prince Alexander's defeat of the attempted invasion of the Russian city of Novgorod by the Teutonic Knights. By April 1939 the film had been seen by 23,000,000 people. In 1941 the director and three others were awarded the Stalin Prize for their contributions. The film features a musical score by the classical composer Sergei Prokofiev, described as \"the best ever composed for the cinema\". Russell Merritt, writing in \"Film Quarterly\", describes it as a \"war propaganda film\". A 1978 Mondadori poll placed \"Alexander Nevsky\" among the world's 100 best motion pictures.\nDuring the Second World War, film propaganda was widely used. Kenneth Clark advised the British government that \"If we renounced interest in entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for getting across our propaganda\"; he suggested using documentaries about the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about British life and character. Michael Powell and Clark agreed on a story about survivors of a U-boat crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting film, \"49th Parallel\" (1941), became the top film at British offices that year. Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for vigilance, too, as in \"Went the Day Well?\" (1942) or the avoidance of \"careless talk\", as in \"The Next of Kin\" (1942).\nIn America, Charlie Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" (1940) clearly satirised fascism. Michael Curtiz's \"Casablanca\" (1943) was not simply a romance between the characters played by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, but vilified the Nazis and glorified resistance to them. Frank Capra's \"Why We Fight\" series (1942–1945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best documentary, though it was designed to \"influence opinion in the U.S. military\".\n\nDuring the Cold War, \"propaganda played as much of a role in the United States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars spent on weaponry.\" \"Face to Face with Communism\" (1951) dramatised an imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such as communist indoctrination.\n\nSubmarine films have their own particular meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 \"Das Boot\", the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include \"The Enemy Below\" (1957) and \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.\n\nA popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the prisoner of war film. The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like Guy Hamilton's \"The Colditz Story\" (1955) and John Sturges's \"The Great Escape\" (1963). They told stories of real escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as fun. David Lean's \"Bridge on the River Kwai\" (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use lush colour to bring out the British stiff upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance. The \"definitive\" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was Billy Wilder's \"Stalag 17\" (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of \"The Deer Hunter\" (1977) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.\n\nCharlie Chaplin's \"Shoulder Arms\" (1918) set a style for war films to come, and was the first comedy about war in film history.\nBritish cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children from London with social comedies such as \"Those Kids from Town\" (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an earl (a country nobleman), while in \"Cottage to Let\" (1941) and \"Went the Day Well?\" (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies. \"Gasbags\" (1941) offered \"zany, irreverent, knockabout\" comedy making fun of everything from barrage balloons to concentration camps. Abbott and Costello's \"Buck Privates\" was successful in America, leading to many further wartime comedies.\n\nWinsor McCay's \"The Sinking of the Lusitania\" (1918) was a silent First World War film. At 12 minutes long, it was the longest animated film made at that time. It was probably the first animated propaganda film to be made; it remains the earliest serious animated drama that has survived. Through World War II, animated propaganda shorts remained influential in American cinema. The Walt Disney Company, working with the American armed forces, produced 400,000 feet of war propaganda films between 1942 and 1945, including \"Der Fuehrer's Face\" (1943) and \"Education for Death\" (1943).\n\nJapanese anime films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of war. \"Akira\" (1988) moves from the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to apocalyptic visions of global conflict; \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (1988) is elegiac on the effect of war on children. \"Barefoot Gen\" (1983) portrays the bombing of Hiroshima through the eyes of a child, but reviewers consider it a less well made film than \"Grave of the Fireflies\" with \"stomach-churning detail\" bizarrely paired with crude artwork, giving it the look of a \"Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoon\".\n\nThe anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often generically blended. Lewis Milestone's \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two Oscars, best picture and best director. Andrew Kelly, analysing \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", defined the genre as showing: the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities. While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's Alice's Restaurant criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board. The number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the 1950s because of McCarthyism and the Hollywood blacklist. The end of the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics: Jean Renoir's prisoner of war masterpiece \"La Grande Illusion\" (\"The Grand Illusion\", 1937), and Stanley Kubrick's \"Paths of Glory\" (1957). The critic David Ehrenstein notes that \"Paths of Glory\" established Kubrick as the \"leading commercial filmmaker of his generation\" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an \"outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army maneuver and the court-martial held in its wake\", contrasting it with the \"classic\" \"All Quiet on the Western Front\"'s story of an innocent \"unstrung by the horrors of war\".\n\nSome later war films combined black comedy and anti-war sentiment, as in the anti-war farces of Mike Nichols's \"Catch-22\" (1970), based on Joseph Heller's satirical novel about the Second World War, and Robert Altman's \"MASH\" (1970), set in Korea, reflecting the attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public.\n\nOther genres were combined in Franklin J. Schaffner's \"Patton\" (1970), about real life General George S. Patton, where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a command. It and \"MASH\" became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time; and \"Patton\" won seven Academy Awards.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1959762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1959762", "title": "Woodward Dream Cruise", "text": "Woodward Dream Cruise\n\nThe Woodward Dream Cruise event is a classic car event held annually on the third Saturday of August in Metropolitan Detroit, Michigan, along Woodward Avenue, a major thoroughfare built in the early 20th century. The WDC Event spans much of the avenue: drivers travel from the suburbs of Pontiac through Ferndale in Oakland County, Michigan, to the State Fair Grounds within the Detroit city limits, just south of 8 Mile Road. An estimated one million spectators attended the 2009 Woodward Dream Cruise.\n\nStarting in 1848, when the roadway was converted from logs to planks, young carriage drivers would race along Woodward Avenue. Woodward Avenue was developed as a major street in Detroit in the early 20th century, and was lined with mansions and major churches.\n\nBy 1958, the roadway was used by youth for unofficial street racing with cars. The wide width, median, and sections lacking a large commercial presence attracted drivers eager for the competition. The numerous drive-ins along the upper road, each with its dedicated local teenaged clientele, were also popular. In the age of the muscle car, Woodward had numerous car dealerships and automobile accessory shops. These completed the attractions for young adults to cruise, race and hang out along the road.\n\nThe Woodward Dream Cruise is the world's largest one-day automotive event, drawing about 1.5 million people and 40,000 classic cars each year from around the globe. Spectators can see muscle cars, street rods, custom, collector and special interest vehicles dating across several decades. The majority of the cars on display are those that were available and popular during the 1950s, 60s and early 70s prior to the OPEC oil embargo. This had resulted in the federal government's Corporate Average Fuel Economy regulations of 1975 and the proliferation, temporarily, of more fuel-efficient and less powerful automobiles. However, the Woodward Dream Cruise also welcomes vehicles of all models whose owners have either scrupulously maintained or customized their car to create a unique vehicle or statement.\n\nPamela S. McCullough, Mayor, and Nelson House, a plumber from Ferndale, came up with the idea for the cruise in 1994 to help raise money for a children's soccer field in his community. Organizers initially expected 30,000 or 40,000 people to come to the August 19, 1995, inaugural cruise on Woodward Avenue in Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge, Berkley, Huntington Woods, Royal Oak and Birmingham. About 250,000 showed up. It is now the largest single-day classic car event in the world, and brings in over $56 million annually to the Metro Detroit economy.\n\nAlthough the cruise officially takes place on only one day, each year the celebration starts early in the summer as the classic vehicles begin to appear on local streets. The sponsoring communities of Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge, Royal Oak, Huntington Woods, Berkley, Bloomfield Township, Bloomfield Hills, and Pontiac collaborate on ancillary events.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22990616", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22990616", "title": "World Forestry Congress", "text": "World Forestry Congress\n\nThe World Forestry Congress (WFC) is the largest and most significant gathering of the world's forestry sector and it has been held every six years since 1926 under the auspices of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), organized by the government of the host country. It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the conservation, management and use of the world's forests, and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and forest policies.\n\nThe aim of the WFC is to contribute to orient/shape international action in silvicultural aspects and stimulate global competency and reflection that can inform the development of the global forestry sector. The WFC may also be providing guidance to national and international forestry organizations as to the most appropriate and effective means to coordinate international actions concerning technical and policy. Finally, the Congress can contribute to identify action lines, define guidelines to stimulate the development of national policies, propose incentives to orient the public and private sector, promote international cooperation in forestry matters, whilst contributing to social progress and the conservation of natural resources at global, regional and national levels.\n\nThe World Forestry Congresses are an international effort aimed at influencing and stimulating reflection and analysis of the different factors, conditions, techniques, methodologies as well as professional or personal positions, thinking and ideas concerning global silviculture science. As such, each WFC has contributed to create awareness, to review and/or to formulate new approaches to technical, scientific or policy actions within the forestry sector.\n\nThe value and utility of the WFC rests also in the opportunity it offers to the world foresters and sectoral decisions-makers to analyse and expose their technical convictions and experiences, to discuss and exchange ideas and thinking, and to broaden their perspectives by sharing their common as well as diverse problems. This is particularly true today, as forestry development is becoming more and more a topic with international linkages and implications.\n\nThe growth in exchanges of knowledge and people in the forestry sector benefits all countries, and especially those with more need for forestry development. The diffusion of the scientific and technical advances as well as the human contacts promoted by the Congress, contribute to a better global balance in this sector and allow dissemination of more accurate information about forestry.\n\nThe WFC does not play the role of assessing the political, economic and social objectives of the participant countries. However, in its capacity as extraordinary assembly with broad representation from many countries and forestry groups, it contributes continuously to drawing public attention to forest related issues, to the need to raise livelihoods, and to the importance of the multiple benefits provided by forests.\n\nFuture WFCs will continue to promote international exchange, both as a result of new research and collaborations and of better comprehension of forest ecosystems and techniques for the sustainable development of these resources in the 21st century.\n\n\nAt the end of World War II, the Government of Finland was again prepared to extend its hospitality to a gathering of the world's foresters. The 1947 session of FAO's annual Conference, held at Geneva, passed a resolution calling for a World Forestry Congress in 1949. FAO's Annual Conference gladly accepted Finland's proposal of Helsinki resuming its role as the site of the Third World Forestry Congress. Professor E. Saari was appointed Chairman of the Organizing Committee and Mr Leppo, Secretary-General.\n\"When this third Congress reviews the progress made since 1936, it will be seen how greatly ideas and practice in various countries have benefited from international exchanges of view and experience.\"\n\nThe Congress achieved an important resolution, recommended the preparation of a forestry dictionary in the major languages of the world. Such a dictionary should not only list translations of terms; it should also give precise definitions of the terms most commonly used in forestry and of the more important phrases of the forester's vocabulary.\n\nThe main themes of the Third Congress were:\n\n\nThe objective of the Congress was to determine the role and place of forested areas in the general land economy and economic development of a country, in the light of progress made to date in knowledge of forest resources, in silviculture and management, in logging and utilization.\n\nThe main themes for discussion were:\n\nRead the following excerpt from FAO's Director-General Message to the Fourth World Forestry Congress:\n\"What do I expect from the Fourth World Forestry Congress? Not directives which only Governments can give, but instructive information and advice on which those directives can be based and, following which, I can see that our abilities for service can be made most effective.\"\n\n\"If we can recognize the inviting horizons ahead and be advised how we can move towards them in helpful association with each other, I am convinced we can realize our ambitions. In so doing we can experience the gratification of achievement which, after all, is perhaps one of the highest forms of compensation to be derived from any endeavor\".\"\n\nThe central theme of the Congress was the \"Multiple Use of Forest and Associated Lands.\" Multiple use means the management of the forest in a manner that, while conserving the basic land resource, will yield a high level of production in the five major uses - wood, water, forage, recreation, and wildlife - for the long-run benefit of the largest possible number of people.\n\nThe main themes discussed in the Congress were: \n\nThe Congress concluded that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services to the welfare of mankind. It was not, however, a panacea which could solve all forest management problems. Often one use must be dominant and other proposed uses must not then be detrimental to the major one. Moreover, there can be disadvantages to multiple use when it is inefficiently applied. But multiple use must be recognized as an important goal of forest policies.\n\nThe Congress was attended by 1,970 participants representing 65 countries.\n\nThe main theme of the Congress was \"The role of forestry in the changing world economy\", based on a study conducted for FAO by Wood: \"World trends and prospects.\"\n\nIn November 1965, representatives from 114 Member States met at FAO's headquarters in Rome, under the chairmanship of Maurice Sauvé, Minister of Forestry, Canada, for the thirteenth session of the Conference, and celebrated the Twentieth Anniversary of the founding of FAO.\n\nReviewing the world forestry situation, the Conference set down certain considerations which must determine the scale and pattern of FAO's future activities. Among these was the following:\n\n\"The forestry administrator today faces tasks considerably more complex than those faced by his predecessors. This is particularly true in developing countries. The number of institutions for higher forestry education responding to these changing needs is as yet insufficient. FAO is uniquely placed to interpret these changing needs, through its intimate contacts with national forest administrations, its working relations with forest industries, its awareness of the requirements of developing countries, and its contacts with, and responsibility for, many forestry educational institutions. On FAO therefore, lies the responsibility for promoting discussion and initiating action, by assisting forestry schools to transform their graduate and postgraduate training.\"\n\nThe main themes discussed in the Congress were:\n\n\nThe Congress urged governments receiving aid from outside sources to create by their own efforts and endeavours such conditions as would enable them best to profit from the technical and material assistance afforded to them. The Congress hoped these kinds of assistance could then be further expanded.\n\nThe Congress was attended by 2,700 participants representing 93 countries.\n\nThe main theme of the Congress was: \"Forests and socioeconomic development.\"\n\nThe congress examined its multi-facet challenges: how to accelerate economic and social progress whilst maintaining or enhancing the quality of the environment, recognizing that the aspiration to raise living standards often finds expression in forms that threaten the environment:\n\n\"The Congress believes that the Plan of Action formulated by the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment at Stockholm in 1972 will influence forestry development throughout the world in the years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new knowledge, new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly believes that, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of forest land tenure, governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the forest, ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the forests are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time. Since we live in one world, and since the forest resources of the world are unevenly distributed, national policies and plans must take account of the international context.\"\n\nThe central phase of the congress was devoted to technical discussions extending over the whole range of the professional interests of the participants. The main themes were:\n\nThe congress received representation from over 80 countries. This was in part made possible by the granting of fellowships by several national technical aid agencies and by the host country.\n\nNamed as co-presidents were the heads of forest administrations in Argentina's neighbouring countries where study tours were conducted: Brazil, Chile and Uruguay.\n\nThe Congress, with the theme \"Forests for People\", examined in depth how forestry might best serve human beings, individually and collectively. As a consequence, the Congress declared that the world's forests must be maintained, on a sustainable basis, for the use and enjoyment of all people.\n\nThe main themes analyzed by the Congress lead to:\n\nOver 2,000 participants from 100 countries and 17 international organizations attended the Congress.\n\nThe Congress strongly emphasized the important role which forest products other than timber play in the life of rural communities depending on the forests. These products play a vital role in providing employment opportunities and raising the living standard of rural people, increasing the number of people supported by forests. The Congress therefore recommended that forest services and international organizations should work for the conservation, promotion and rational utilization of such products.\n\nThe year 1985 had been declared \"International Year of the Forest\" by the FAO Council. Year 1985 also marked FAO's fortieth anniversary, as well as the occasion of the Ninth World Forestry Congress in Mexico City.\nThe theme of the Congress was \"Forest Resources in the Integral Development of Society.\"\n\nIt emphasized the need for foresters to look beyond their own resource base to consider how forest policies can be formulated in the light of such global events as an international banking crisis. The purpose of the Congress was to develop clear lines of action that may serve as guidelines for (a) formulating national policies; (b) providing incentives and guidance to the private and government sectors; and (c) promoting international cooperation in forestry.\n\nDuring the 20 sessions of the three technical commissions into which the Congress was divided, 20 agenda items were discussed, with the presentation of 22 basic documents and 160 special documents. The long list of subjects studied included:\n\nBesides the sessions of the Congress itself, a series of satellite meetings was held, including:\n\nOver 2,000 participants from 105 countries attended the Congress, including representatives of many national and international organizations, institutions and associations and a large number of private individuals. Amongst the participants were professional foresters, scientists, educators, students, politicians, industry officers, workers and bankers.\n\nThe overall theme of the Congress was \"Forests, a heritage for the future\".\nCongress members confronted the difficult task of reconciling conservation of the resource base with the need for its rational use in sustainable development.\n\nThe main themes of the Congress were as follows:\n\nRead the following excerpt form an interview with FAO's Director-General, Edouard Saouma:\n\n\"\"The threat to forests is worldwide and by no means confined to tropical forests. In short, we run the very real risk of undermining a resource base that is fundamental to the future development of the Earth. This must not be allowed to occur. Our responsibility extends not only to all people now living on the planet, but also to future generations. Therefore, I cannot but applaud the selection of \"Forests, a heritage for the future\" as the theme for the Tenth World Forestry Congress. As co-organizer of the Congress, along with the Government of France, FAO has committed substantial human and financial resources to ensuring that this will be the most widely followed Congress to date. The fruits of this effort are already evident; the number of voluntary papers was forecast as approximately 300 but more than 700 have been received. In the same vein, I would also wish to note that FAO has chosen \"Trees for life\" as the theme for World Food Day, 16 October 1991.\"\"\nMore than 2,500 forestry decision-makers from 136 countries attended the Congress.\n\nThe general theme of the Congress was \"Forestry for Sustainable Development: Towards the Twenty-first Century\". The theme amply reflects the unique opportunity offered to the Congress and to the forestry sector at large to provide technical responses to the political issues raised in these fora.\n\nIn fact, as the last of these gatherings last century, the Eleventh WFC carried with it the special responsibility of summing up what had been achieved and of looking ahead to the challenges of the third millennium. Against this background, the general theme was selected in clear recognition of the importance of viewing forestry not as an isolated technical discipline, but rather as an important component of overall socio-economic development.\n\nThe technical sessions of the Congress were organized around the following main programme areas:\n\nThe programme of the Congress presented 38 themes for discussion, each one based in a special document with a total of 1.200 voluntary papers. During the nine-day conference, delegates attended eight plenary sessions and 43 technical sessions. In addition to these sessions, three pre-Congress satellite meetings took place, an informal ministerial meeting and approximately 30 side meetings and other special events.\n\nMore than 4,400 participants from 145 countries attended the Congress, representing the scientific community, governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector.\n\nThe Antalya Declaration expressed concern about the discrepancy between the impressive progress in the development of concepts and tools, national programmes, global and regional treaties and varied partnerships among governments and international organizations, and the continued alarming rate of deforestation and degradation of forest resources, calling for a harmonization of the planet and its inhabitants' needs with the forests' potential to produce a vital support through political, institutional and government forestry strategies, also as a contribution to the UN Millennium Development Goals and other international agreements.\n\nThe Congress requested FAO to present an assessment of progress on the strategies outlined in the Final Statement to the XIII World Forestry Congress.\n\nThe main theme of the Congress was \"Forests: source of life.\"\n\nThe thematic areas were developed around the followings aspects:\n\nA total of 1,038 voluntary papers and 456 posters were received from all over the world - of which nearly 200 were selected for presentation, based on peer review by specialists in FAO and in Canadian institutions. In addition, 32 invited papers were presented, categorized as position papers and special papers. The technical programme was structured around ten plenary sessions, 38 theme sessions, poster sessions and 115 side events. Innovation with respect to preceding congresses included ten eco-regional sessions followed by round table discussions, and six open fora.\n\nThe Congress attracted 4,061 participants from more than 140 countries. The participants, representing a cross-section of society concerned with forests, included individuals from rural communities, private forest owners, labour, indigenous peoples, youth, industry, environmental and other non-governmental organizations, the scientific and academic community, various levels of government and international organizations.\n\nThe main output of the congress, the Final Statement, identifies areas of priority concern and is intended to encourage decisions and action by those involved with various aspects of forests and forestry, and in other related sectors.\n\nThe Final Statement calls for the development and dissemination of methodologies for assessing, reporting and managing the complete array of forest products; calls for action to manage forests and intensify forest landscape restoration and rehabilitation activities to support livelihoods, increase forest cover, enhance biological diversity and functionality, and minimize the impact of invasive alien species; and encourage collaborative partnerships involving women, forest owners, indigenous peoples, non-governmental organizations, local communities, industry and public agencies.\n\nThe XIII World Forestry Congress was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from 18 to 23 October 2009.\n\nUnder the theme \"Forests in development: a vital balance\" over 7,000 experts from governments, academia, research, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations came from all continents to discuss and exchange experiences over a seven-day period on a broad range of forestry related topics.\n\nThe Congress included presentations, discussions, round tables, parallel events and exhibitions, focusing on the following main issues:\n\n\nThe Congress addressed social, ecological and economic aspects of sustainable forest management in local, regional and global contexts.\n\nThe XIV World Forestry Congress was held in South Africa, 7–11 September 2015. The central theme of WFC XIV was \"Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future\". WFC XIV emphasized the role of forests in income generation, employment creation and equity and the vital links between forests and climate change, biodiversity conservation and sustainable water resources.\nThe six Congress sub-themes included:\n\nNearly 4,000 participants from 138 countries attended the Congress. The meeting produced three outcome documents in 6 languages: \n\nOver 3,500 people from 120 countries contributed 825 technical papers and 269 posters. Thirty percent of the papers were from Africa and 30 percent written by women as lead authors.\n\nThe summary brief \"Foresters call for action: Future land management needs better integration of sectors\" listed ten key recommendations and action points from the Congress.\n\nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations released key findings of an assessment of the world's forest resources in the report \"Global Forest Resources Assessment 2015\".\n\nDuring the Congress, Ugandan community leader Gertrude Kabusimbi Kenyangi was awarded the Collaborative Partnership on Forests 2015 Wangari Maathai ‘Forest Champions’ Award in recognition of her efforts to promote the conservation and sustainable use of her country's forest resources. Given in recognition of outstanding efforts to improve and sustain forests, the award was established in 2012 by the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), which is chaired by FAO. Its name honours the memory of Wangari Maathai, the Kenyan environmentalist and the first African woman to win a Nobel Peace Prize for her contribution to sustainable development, democracy and peace.\n\n\n\nExternal portals:\n\n"}
{"id": "4145437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4145437", "title": "Year zero", "text": "Year zero\n\nYear zero does not exist in the anno Domini system usually used to number years in the Gregorian calendar and in its predecessor, the Julian calendar. In this system, the year is followed by . However, there is a year zero in astronomical year numbering (where it coincides with the Julian year ) and in ISO 8601:2004 (where it coincides with the Gregorian year ) as well as in all Buddhist and Hindu calendars.\n\nThe \"Anno Domini\" era was introduced in 525 by Scythian monk Dionysius Exiguus (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his Easter table. He introduced the new era to avoid using the \"Diocletian era\", based on the accession of Roman Emperor Diocletian, as he did not wish to continue the memory of a persecutor of Christians. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the \"present year\" was \"the consulship of Probus Junior [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]\" which was also 525 years \"since the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ\". How he arrived at that number is unknown.\n\nDionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric Bede (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\" (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English before Christ once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number days of the month, weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the days of the week using a counting origin of one in Ecclesiastical Latin. Previous Christian histories used \"anno mundi\" (\"in the year of the world\") beginning on the first day of creation, or \"anno Adami\" (\"in the year of Adam\") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the Genesis creation narrative), used by Africanus, or \"anno Abrahami\" (\"in the year of Abraham\") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the Septuagint, used by Eusebius of Caesarea, all of which assigned \"one\" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.\n\nIn chapter II of book I of \"Ecclesiastical history\", Bede stated that Julius Caesar invaded Britain \"in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord\", while stating in chapter III, \"in the year of Rome 798, Claudius\" also invaded Britain and \"within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord\". Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term \"before Christ\" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, \"not\" a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase \"ante incarnationis dominicae tempus\" (\"before the time of the lord's incarnation\"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the Middle Ages.\n\nNeither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of Roman numerals. The Babylonian system of the BC era had used the idea of \"nothingness\" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use Latin number words, or the word \"nulla\" (meaning \"nothing\") alongside Roman numerals. Zero was invented in India in the sixth century, and was either transferred or reinvented by the Arabs by about the eighth century. The Arabic numeral for zero (0) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.\n\nThe \"anno Domini\" nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the to historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in \"Fasciculus Temporum\" by Werner Rolevinck in 1474, alongside years of the world (\"anno mundi\"). The terms \"anno Domini\", \"Dionysian era\", \"Christian era\", \"vulgar era\", and \"common era\" were used interchangeably between the Renaissance and the 19th century, at least in Latin. But \"vulgar era\" was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after \"vulgar\" acquired the meaning of \"offensively coarse\", replacing its original meaning of \"common\" or \"ordinary\". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.\n\nHistorians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, and , there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage \"anno Domini\" 1 is preceded by the year 1 BC, without an intervening year zero. Neither the choice of calendar system (whether Julian or Gregorian) nor the era (\"Anno Domini\" or Common Era) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.\n\nIn astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is −1, and so on.\n\nThe letters \"AD\", \"BC\", \"CE, or \"BCE\" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to −1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.\n\nIn 1627, the German astronomer Johannes Kepler first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his \"Rudolphine Tables\". He labeled the year \"Christi\" and inserted it between years labeled \"Ante Christum\" (BC) and \"Post Christum\" (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets. Then in 1702 the French astronomer Philippe de la Hire used a year he labeled at the end of years labeled \"ante Christum\" (BC), immediately before years labeled \"post Christum\" (AD) on the mean motion pages in his \"Tabulæ Astronomicæ\", thus adding the designation \"0\" to Kepler's \"Christi\". Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer Jacques Cassini , who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero, completed the transition in his \"Tables astronomiques\", simply labeling this year \"0\", which he placed at the end of years labeled \"avant Jesus-Christ\" (BC), immediately before years labeled \"après Jesus-Christ\" (AD).\n\nISO 8601:2004 (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the proleptic Gregorian calendar for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The \"basic\" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1 BC. Several \"expanded\" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an absolute value one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only ISO 646 (7-bit ASCII) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a hyphen-minus.\n\nAll eras used with Hindu and Buddhist calendars, such as the Saka era or the Kali Yuga, begin with the year 0. All these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a 24-hour clock: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, \"n\" minutes.\n\n"}
