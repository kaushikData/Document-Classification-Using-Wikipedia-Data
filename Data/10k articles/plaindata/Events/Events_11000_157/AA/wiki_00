These missile attack warnings were correctly identified as a false alarm by Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov, an officer of the Soviet Air Defence Forces. This decision is seen as having prevented a retaliatory nuclear attack based on erroneous data on the United States and its NATO allies, which would have probably resulted in immediate escalation of the cold-war stalemate to a full-scale nuclear war. Investigation of the satellite warning system later confirmed that the system had malfunctioned.\n\nThe incident occurred at a time of severely strained relations between the United States and the Soviet Union. Responding to the Soviet Union's deployment of 14 SS-20/RSD-10 theatre nuclear missiles, the NATO Double-Track Decision was taken in December 1979 by the military commander of NATO to deploy 108 Pershing II nuclear missiles in Western Europe with the ability to hit targets in eastern Ukraine, Belarus or Lithuania within 10 minutes and the longer range, but slower BGM-109G Ground Launched Cruise Missile (GLCM) to strike potential targets farther to the east. In mid-February 1981, and continuing until 1983, psychological operations by the United States began. These were designed to test Soviet radar vulnerability and to demonstrate US nuclear capabilities. They included clandestine naval operations, in the Barents, Norwegian, Black, and Baltic seas and near the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) gap, as well as flights by American bombers, occasionally several times per week, directly to Soviet airspace that turned away only at the last moment. \n\"It really got to them,\" recalls Dr. William Schneider, [former] undersecretary of state for military assistance and technology, who saw classified \"after-action reports\" that indicated U.S. flight activity. \"They didn't know what it all meant. A squadron would fly straight at Soviet airspace, and other radars would light up and units would go on alert. Then at the last minute the squadron would peel off and return home.\"\nFrom the accounts of CIA and senior KGB officers\n, by May 1981, \nobsessed with historical parallels with 1941 and Reaganite rhetoric, and with no defensive capability against the Pershing IIs, \nSoviet leaders believed the United States was preparing a secret nuclear attack on the USSR and initiated Operation RYaN. Under this, agents abroad monitored service and technical personnel who would implement a nuclear attack so as to be able either to preempt it or have mutually assured destruction.\n\nOn 1 September 1983, the Soviet military shot down a South Korean passenger jet, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, that had strayed into Soviet airspace. All 269 people aboard the aircraft were killed, including U.S. Congressman Larry McDonald and many other Americans. The first Pershing II missiles were reportedly deployed in late November 1983.\n\nBruce Blair, an expert on Cold War nuclear strategies and former president of the World Security Institute in Washington, D.C., says the American–Soviet relationship at that time \nhad deteriorated to the point where the Soviet Union as a system—not just the Kremlin, not just Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, not just the KGB—but as a system, was geared to expect an attack and to retaliate very quickly to it. It was on hair-trigger alert. It was very nervous and prone to mistakes and accidents. The false alarm that happened on Petrov's watch could not have come at a more dangerous, intense phase in U.S.–Soviet relations. \nIn an interview aired on American television, Blair said, \"The Russians (Soviets) saw a U.S. government preparing for a first strike, headed by a President Ronald Reagan capable of ordering a first strike.\" Regarding the incident involving Petrov, he said, \"I think that this is the closest our country has come to accidental nuclear war.\"\n\nOn 26 September 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant colonel in the Soviet Air Defense Forces, was the officer on duty at the Serpukhov-15 bunker near Moscow which housed the command center of the Soviet early warning satellites, code-named Oko. Petrov's responsibilities included observing the satellite early warning network and notifying his superiors of any impending nuclear missile attack against the Soviet Union. If notification was received from the early warning systems that inbound missiles had been detected, the Soviet Union's strategy was an immediate and compulsory nuclear counter-attack against the United States (launch on warning), specified in the doctrine of mutual assured destruction.\n\nShortly after midnight, the bunker's computers reported that one intercontinental ballistic missile was heading toward the Soviet Union from the United States. Petrov considered the detection a computer error, since a first-strike nuclear attack by the United States was likely to involve hundreds of simultaneous missile launches in order to disable any Soviet means of a counterattack. Furthermore, the satellite system's reliability had been questioned in the past. Petrov dismissed the warning as a false alarm, though accounts of the event differ as to whether he notified his superiors or not after he concluded that the computer detections were false and that no missile had been launched. Petrov's suspicion that the warning system was malfunctioning was confirmed when no missile in fact arrived. Later, the computers identified four additional missiles in the air, all directed towards the Soviet Union. Petrov suspected that the computer system was malfunctioning again, despite having no direct means to confirm this. The Soviet Union's land radar was incapable of detecting missiles beyond the horizon.\n\nIt was subsequently determined that the false alarms were caused by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds and the satellites' Molniya orbits, an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite.\n\nIn explaining the factors leading to his decision, Petrov cited his belief and training that any U.S. first strike would be massive, so five missiles seemed an illogical start. In addition, the launch detection system was new and in his view not yet wholly trustworthy, while ground radar had failed to pick up corroborative evidence even after several minutes of the false alarm.\n\nPetrov underwent intense questioning by his superiors about his actions. Initially, he was praised for his decision. General Yury Votintsev, then commander of the Soviet Air Defense's Missile Defense Units, who was the first to hear Petrov's report of the incident (and the first to reveal it to the public in the 1990s), stated that Petrov's \"correct actions\" were \"duly noted.\" Petrov himself stated he was initially praised by Votintsev and was promised a reward, but recalled that he was also reprimanded for improper filing of paperwork with the pretext that he had not described the incident in the military diary.\n\nHe received no reward. According to Petrov, this was because the incident and other bugs found in the missile detection system embarrassed his superiors and the influential scientists who were responsible for it, so that if he had been officially rewarded, they would have had to be punished. He was reassigned to a less sensitive post, took early retirement (although he emphasized that he was not \"forced out\" of the army, as is sometimes claimed by Western sources), and suffered a nervous breakdown.\n\nOleg Kalugin, a former KGB chief of foreign counter-intelligence who knew Soviet chairman Andropov well, says that Andropov's distrust of American leaders was profound. It is conceivable that if Petrov had declared the satellite warnings valid, such an erroneous report could have provoked the Soviet leadership into becoming bellicose. Kalugin said, \"The danger was in the Soviet leadership thinking, 'The Americans may attack, so we better attack first.'\"\n\nThe incident became known publicly in the 1990s upon the publication of Votintsev's memoirs. Widespread media reports since then have increased public awareness of Petrov's actions.\n\n\n"}

The company manufactures food products in the United States and internationally — specializing in turkey, cured deli meats, raw roasts and specialty products such as soups and salads, sandwiches, and entrées.\n\nButterball LLC was a joint venture of Smithfield Foods and Maxwell Farms Inc., an affiliate of the Goldsboro Milling Co. Seaboard Corporation bought Smithfield's stake in Butterball in 2010. The company sells over one billion pounds of turkey a year. Though the \"Butterball\" brand has been formally recognized since 1940, Butterball LLC was formed in 2006.\n\nIn Canada, the rights to Butterball are owned by Exceldor Foods Ltd.\n\nAccording to Butterball, the following products are sold under the Butterball name:\n\n\n\nAmong numerous other brands, English-bred Butterball turkeys are sold in the United Kingdom during Christmas time for the Christmas feast.\n\nThe name Butterball was originally registered as trademark #378,438 on June 11, 1940, by Ada Walker of Wyoming, Ohio. Leo Peters purchased the trademark in February 1951. Leo Peters licensed the name to Swift and Co. for 10 years before selling it in the 1960s. Peters sold the name \"Butterball\" to Swift, which was acquired by ConAgra in 1990.\n\nLeo Peters retained rights to use the name Butterball Farms for his butter products and the company operates today as Butterball Farms, Inc., producing and marketing shaped butter products.\n\nIn October 2006, ConAgra's Butterball branded turkey business was sold to North Carolina-based Carolina Turkeys, making Carolina Turkey the largest turkey producer in the United States. The company, located southeast of Raleigh, NC in Mount Olive, North Carolina on the Wayne and Duplin county line, subsequently renamed itself Butterball LLC.\n\nIn 2008, the company moved its headquarters to a new $12 million building in Greenfield North off Interstate 40 in Garner, North Carolina. The headquarters has a \"customer experience center\" with a special kitchen for promotional demonstrations.\n\nSmithfield offered $200 million to Maxwell Farms for the portion of Butterball that Smithfield did not own. Chief executive C. Larry Pope said at that time that he hoped Maxwell Farms would spend more on the company's facilities and marketing. A decision had to be made whether to buy Maxwell's share or sell Smithfield's. On September 10, 2010, Smithfield announced the sale of its 49 percent share of Butterball for an estimated $175 million. Maxwell Farms will sell 50 percent of Butterball to Seaboard Corp.\n\nWalter “Gator” Pelletier, past chairman of the National Turkey Federation, is Butterball LLC's corporate secretary — managing all operating activities from turkey production and directing Maxwell Farms, the managing partner of Butterball. Pelletier is also president of Maxwell Farms, Inc., vice president of Goldsboro Milling Company, and secretary-treasurer of Maxwell Foods, Inc. Pelletier had joined Goldsboro Milling Company in 1981.\n\nBeginning in late 1981, Butterball has maintained a toll-free telephone line called the Turkey Talk-Line to help customers with cooking and preparation questions. Eleven thousand people called in 1981, and in recent years the number has grown to over 200,000 each holiday season. The most frequent question asked is how long a turkey takes to defrost.\n\nIn \"The West Wing\" episode \"The Indians in the Lobby\", President Josiah Bartlet calls the number (referred to as the \"Butterball Hotline\" in the script) to discuss stuffing and cooking his Thanksgiving turkey.\n\nAnimal welfare activists such as Mercy for Animals, the Humane Society of the United States, and PETA have accused Butterball of animal cruelty. These organizations cite intentional cruelty inflicted on the birds, as well as the incidental cruelty inherent in the slaughter methods used, and the breeding practices which produce animals too large to reproduce without human intervention.\n\nIn October 2012, a Mercy for Animals investigator documented a pattern of abuse and neglect at numerous Butterball turkey operations in North Carolina. The investigation revealed workers kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, and throwing turkeys onto the ground or on top of other birds; birds suffering from serious untreated illnesses and injuries, including open sores, infections, and broken bones; and workers grabbing birds by their wings or necks and violently slamming them into tiny transport crates with no regard for their welfare.\n\nThis investigation occurred less than one year after a Mercy for Animals undercover investigation into a different Butterball turkey facility led to five workers being charged with criminal cruelty to animals. Mercy for Animals’ 2011 investigation at a Butterball turkey factory farm in Shannon, Hoke County, North Carolina revealed Butterball workers violently kicking and stomping on birds, dragging them by their wings and necks, slamming them into transport crates, and leaving turkeys to suffer from serious untreated injuries and infections. As a result of the investigation, North Carolina officials raided the facility and arrested several employees.\n\nIn August 2012, Butterball worker Brian Douglas pleaded guilty to felony cruelty to animals—marking the first-ever felony conviction for cruelty to factory-farmed birds in United States history. Several days later, another Butterball employee, Rueben Mendoza, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor cruelty to animals and felony identity theft.\n\nIn February 2013, two more Butterball workers, Terry Johnson and Billy McBride, were found guilty of misdemeanor animal cruelty as a result of MFA's investigation.\n\nIn addition to the felony and misdemeanor cruelty convictions, MFA’s investigation at Butterball uncovered government corruption. Dr. Sarah Jean Mason, the director of Animal Health Programs with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture, was arrested and pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice charges after admitting to warning Butterball about the raid by law enforcement and potentially compromising the criminal cruelty investigation.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "32259623", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32259623", "title": "Callao affair", "text": "Callao affair\n\nThe Callao affair occurred in November 1820, during the Peruvian War of Independence. It began when a Spanish fort opened fire on the United States warship USS \"Macedonian\". Though the ship was damaged, the Americans did not violate their neutrality by counterattacking. On the following day, a boat filled with United States Navy sailors was attacked, resulting in the deaths of two seamen and the wounding of eight others. Two days after that, an American merchant ship was attacked and her crew had to abandon ship. Ultimately, there was no significant response by the United States to the attacks on their shipping and their citizens, though the Spanish government vowed to punish the perpetrators.\n\nInspired by the French revolution in 1789, and the Peruvian revolution, the people of Chile joined forces with the rebel Peruvians and revolted against Spanish authority in 1820. As result, a rebel First Chilean Navy Squadron under Scottish Captain Thomas Cochrane attacked the Spanish fleet anchored off Callao on the night of November 5, during which the rebels captured the 44 gun frigate \"Esmeralda\" with heavy loss of life to the Spanish defenders. The capture of the ship crippled Spain's operational capabilities in the Pacific Ocean and infuriated the Royalist inhabitants of Callao. During the battle, the frigate USS \"Macedonian\", under Captain John Downes, was also at port with the mission of protecting six American merchant schooners which were being harassed by both the Chilean fleet and the Spanish on shore. Because the \"Macedonian\" was so close to the battle area, the Spanish military in Callao assumed that she had supported Cochrane's fleet in the attack. So instead of aiming for the Chilean ships, the garrison opened fire on the frigate and one of the American merchantmen with hot shot from Fortaleza del Real Felipe. Multiple rounds ripped through the ships' rigging though the damage was repairable and no Americans were harmed.\n\nThe \"Macedonian\"s carpenter, Samuel Holbrook, later described the incident; \"\"Their shot flew round us like hail, cutting away our cross-jack yard, and much of our rigging. Many of the red hot shot struck near us.\" Captain Downes was in Lima at the time and a first lieutenant was in command and he ordered the sails hoisted to bring the vessel out of the fort's range. On the following day, the lieutenant sent the tender \"Buckskin\" filled with sailors into port for provisions. However, while the sailors were still heading to shore, Spanish troops at the docks opened fire, killing two men and wounding six others. Holbrook described the scene; \"blood and brain scattered round the inside as though a bullock had been killed in her.\"\" There was no landing as some sources claim and the survivors went back to their ship without obtaining the fresh food they were looking for.\n\nAt the same time that the \"Macedonian\" sailors were attacked, American and British merchantmen were being looted in the port and two days later, on November 8, the American schooner \"Rampart\" was attacked by the fort and heavily damaged while trying to offload her cargo, forcing her crew to abandon ship. The \"Macedonian\" also took on board that day several American and British refugees who were in fear of being killed by the natives. Captain Downes was still not interested in exacting redress for the three incidents but he did send the Spanish Viceroy Joaquin de la Pezuela a letter of protest.\n\nPezuela said he would punish those responsible but whether he actually did so or not remains unknown. Due to the blockade, Captain Downes was afraid his ship would be seized as it was illegally carrying over a million dollars in Spanish gold, something Cochrane's spies had informed him of some time prior. So, when the Americans were leaving Callao, they expected to have to fight their way past the Chilean fleet, but Cochrane ignored the frigate and let it go without any opposition. Captain Downes remained off the South American coast until March 1821 to protect American merchant sailors, many of whom were either imprisoned by the viceroy, or murdered by the Spanish military and their Peruvian subjects. The murder and imprisonment of United States citizens at Lima and Callao was attributed to the fact that some of the victims were captured from ships of Cochrane's fleet and were legally prisoners of war, though many of the American victims were not involved in the conflict and were killed along with other innocent foreigners. In the end, there was no retaliation by the United States in response to the attacks on their vessels or their citizens, other than the feeble letter of protest from Downes.\n\n\n"}

He was inspired by the Saint Silvester Road Race in São Paulo and decided to set up his own local race in his hometown with the same format – hosting the race on New Year's Eve. Initially a men's event only on a course of around , the race attracted high level competition from the beginning, with Poland's Bronisław Malinowski winning the 1974 race the same year as his gold medal win at the 1974 European Athletics Championships. Due to the race's growing popularity, the competition was divided into two segments: an elite-level race and a public race.\n\nAnnick Loir was the first known women's winner in 1975, but a separate women's division (over around ) was not formally established until 1983. The race distances were set at for both men and women from 1996 onwards, allowing the race to serve as a qualifier for the French 10 km championships. The date of the race has not always been 31 December due to organisational restrictions, but it is usually held within the final days of the year. No race was held in 1999 due to Cyclone Lothar and Martin. The races for 2000 and 2005 were held on New Year's Day instead. The competition gained IAAF Bronze Label Road Race status in 2013.\n\nTop level athletes from both France and abroad have competed in Houilles.

In 1625 and 1626 Opitz visited the Dresden court, to work with Schütz on a \"Sing-Comoedie\" based on the model of Jacopo Peri's \"Dafne\". Opitz rewrote the libretto after Rinuccini, translating it into Alexandrine verse, and his libretto was so highly regarded that it was later adapted back into Italian by later Italian librettists. Opitz and Schütz' were probably attracted by religious content of the work, rather than the purely pagan mythology of Dafne or Euridice. The electoral secretary to the Saxon Court, Johann Seusse also exerted influence on the project.\n\nAlthough long unquestioned as \"the first German opera\" the performance started no notable tradition in Germany, and (1991) made the controversial proposal that Dafne was in fact a spoken drama with inserted song and ballet numbers.

As a statutory offence it dates back to 1360. The offence is complete, whether any verdict has been given or not, and whether the verdict is in accordance with the weight of evidence or otherwise. The person making the attempt, and any member of the jury who consents, are equally punishable.\n\nThe legal term \"embracery\" comes from the Old Fr. \"embraseour\", an embracer, i.e., one who excites or instigates, literally one who sets on fire, from \"embraser\", to kindle a fire. This is unrelated to the common word \"embrace\", i.e., to hold or clasp in the arms, which is from French \"embracer\", from Latin \"bracchia\", arms.\n\nThe false verdict of a jury, whether occasioned by embracery or otherwise, was formerly considered criminal, and jurors were severely punished, being proceeded against by writ of attaint. The Juries Act 1825, in abolishing writs of attaint, made a special exemption as regards jurors guilty of embracery (s.61). Prosecution for the offence has been so extremely rare that when a case occurred in 1891 it was stated that no precedent could be found for the indictment. The defendant was fined £200, afterwards reduced to £100.\n\nBy 2010 the offence was regarded as obsolete and such misconduct more likely to be charged as perverting the course of justice. The last conviction for embracery in the UK was at Caernarvon Crown Court in November 1975 but it was quashed by the Court of Appeal the following year on the initiative of Lord Justice Lawton, who said that the offence was obsolete. \n\nThe offence was abolished by section 17 of the Bribery Act 2010, as from 1 July 2011.\n\nIn the United States, embracery prosecutions have occurred as recently as 1989, when a county commissioner in Georgia was sentenced to a fine and probation.\n\n"}

{"id": "659845", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=659845", "title": "International Race of Champions", "text": "International Race of Champions\n\nInternational Race of Champions (IROC) was a North American auto racing competition, created by Les Richter, Roger Penske and Mike Phelps, promoted as an equivalent of an American All-Star Game or The Masters. Despite its name, the IROC was primarily associated with North American oval-racing culture.\n\nDrivers raced identically-prepared stock cars set up by a single team of mechanics in an effort to make the race purely a test of driver ability. It was run with a small field of invited drivers (6–12). It was created and developed in 1972 by David Lockton, the developer of the Ontario Motor Speedway, launched in 1973, with Mark Donohue being the first driver to win the championship in 1974. The cars used that year were Porsche Carrera RSRs. Donohue's win in the fourth and last race of that season was his last win, as he died in a Formula One crash at the Österreichring in practice for the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix. The series was not run in 1981, 1982, or 1983.\n\nIn 2007, IROC could not find a sponsor and postponed the first two races at Daytona and Texas. IROC went on hiatus in 2007 hoping to return with a sponsor in 2008, which did not happen. In March 2008, IROC auctioned off its tools, equipment, cars, and memorabilia, and went out of business.\n\nThe drivers invited were from a broad range of racing disciplines: Indy cars, NASCAR, sports car racing, and on occasion, WoO, and drag racing. Criteria for invitation was very loose, but typically consisted of recent season champions of the respective series, and individual winners of big events (Indy, Daytona, etc.)\n\nDue to its fundamental stock car formula, and the majority of racing being contested on ovals, the series was often dominated by NASCAR participants (which was the major criticism of the series). Also, in the small field of about a dozen cars, the share of NASCAR invitees grew over time; from just three drivers in the first season to seven in the final season. The last non-NASCAR based champion of the series was Al Unser, Jr. in 1988. Although open wheel drivers had numerous successes, , drivers from road racing series had only won two races in the history of IROC. In some years, no sports car drivers were even invited.\n\nThrough 2003, IROC was also known for its rainbow of car colors being easily recognized from all other closed wheel racing series. Car numbers were utilized for scoring purposes, but were not the primary means of identification. Instead, the drivers' surname would appear on the door of the car. Exceptions were made when Mario and Michael Andretti raced in the same events. In those cases, their first name was used. The numbers would change from race to race, with the number 1 would be given to the driver starting first, and so on. The colors would correspond to the numbers. Before the races, drivers were assigned via blind drawing, and was how the starting grid for the first race was determined. The finishing order of the race would be inverted for the second race's starting grid, while the reverse of the points standings determined races three and four's grids. Numbers were assigned by the starting position. After the first race, the numbers would be assigned based on points standings. This would make it very confusing for fans, as one week their favorite driver could be driving the blue #1 car, and the next week he could be in the #5 orange car.\n\nIn 2004, the alcoholics beverage company, Diageo became the series' title sponsor, utilising their Crown Royal brand whiskey, replacing True Value, and the procedure changed, as well. Cars would be identically painted in white, with trim which could be changed to represent the driver's colors in his regular racing series. Also, a driver's number in IROC would be his regular number. Thus, Steve Kinser would use green trim with the #11, and Matt Kenseth's car featured yellow trim with a #17.\n\nThe only exception to the numbering scheme involves the number 3. Following the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500, IROC retired the use of #3. Any driver with that regular number would use #03 instead. Hélio Castroneves raced with #03, but the car kept red trim, in reflection of his IRL car being red.\n\nIf there was a numbering conflict, another number would be substituted. In most cases, for one-digit numbers, a zero would be added in front. Otherwise a historically notable number would be run. (Penske drivers, for one instance, could use #66, owing to Mark Donohue.)\n\nFrom 1992–2005, the IROC season was exclusively run on ovals. In 2006, road courses were reintroduced to the IROC series with the cars competing on the road course at Daytona International Speedway. Also, in 2006, two drivers shared one car in an IROC first. Grand American Road Racing drivers Max Angelelli and Wayne Taylor each drove two races in 2006, trying to win the IROC title as a team, reflecting sportscar racing as a two-man team. However, in 2007, that may not have been used, as 2006 Grand American Road Racing champion Jörg Bergmeister was a solo champion. Bergmeister had to split driving duties with various drivers because his regular co-driver was forced to sit out three races because they were raced with the Indy Racing League; Colin Braun, who was 17, could not race in those three races under MSA rulings.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22439150", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22439150", "title": "Jennifer Ringley", "text": "Jennifer Ringley\n\nJennifer Kaye Ringley (born August 10, 1976) is an Internet personality and former lifecaster. She is known for creating the popular website JenniCam. Previously, live webcams transmitted static shots from cameras aimed through windows or at coffee pots. Ringley's innovation was simply to allow others to view her daily activities. She was the first web-based \"lifecaster\". In June 2008, CNET hailed JenniCam as one of the greatest defunct websites in history. She retired from lifecasting at the end of 2003.\n\nRegarded by some as a conceptual artist, Ringley viewed her site as a straightforward document of her life. She did not wish to filter the events that were shown on her camera, so sometimes she was shown nude or engaging in sexual behavior, including sexual intercourse and masturbation. This was a new use of Internet technology in 1996 and some viewers were interested in its sociological implications while others watched it for sexual arousal. The JenniCam website coincided with a rise in surveillance as a feature of popular culture, exemplified by the 1998 film \"The Truman Show\" and reality television programs such as \"Big Brother\", and as a feature of contemporary art and new media art. From a sociological point of view, JenniCam was an important early example of how the internet could create a cyborg subject by integrating human images with the internet. As such, JenniCam set the stage for conversations regarding the relationship of technology and gender.\n\nRingley's desire to maintain the purity of the cam-eye view of her life eventually created the need to establish that she was within her rights as an adult to broadcast such information, in the legal sense, and that it was not harmful to other adults. Unlike later for-profit webcam services, Ringley did not spend her day displaying her naked body and she spent much more time discussing her romantic life than she did her sex life. Ringley maintained her webcam site for seven years and eight months.\n\nSources stated that JenniCam received over 100 million visitors weekly. Nate Lanxon of \"CNET\" said \"remember this is 1996 and the Web as we know it now had barely lost its virginity, let alone given birth to the God-child we know as the modern Internet.\"\n\nOn April 3, 1996, during her junior year at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, the 19-year-old Ringley installed a webcam in her college dorm room and provided images from that cam on a webpage. The webpage would automatically refresh every three minutes with the most recent picture from the camera. Initially, anyone with Internet access could observe the often mundane events of Ringley's life; however, a few months after its start, Ringley started charging viewers for full entry to her site. JenniCam was one of the first web sites that continuously and voluntarily surveyed a private life. Her first webcam contained only black-and-white images of her in the dorm room. JenniCam attracted up to four million views a day at its peak.\n\nAt times during the first couple of years of JenniCam, Ringley performed stripteases for the webcam. This continued until an incident occurred wherein she was discovered by a group of hackers on Efnet who teased her for their own amusement. After she reacted humorously to their taunts, JenniCam was hacked, and Ringley received death threats. The hackers turned out to be approximately 100 people including a handful of teen pranksters, but Ringley did no more stripteases after that.\n\nInitially, the camera tended to be turned off during especially private moments, but eventually this custom was abandoned, and images were captured of Ringley engaging in sex.\n\nIn May 1997, Ringley graduated from Dickinson with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics.\n\nWhen Ringley moved to Washington, D.C. in 1998, she added webcams to cover the additional living space (four webcams captured images of her life). She began charging for access to her site, allowing both paid and free access with the paid access updating the images more frequently than the free access. She added more pages to her website that included pictures of her cats and ferrets. Her site was doing well as she stayed home and claimed her profession to be a \"web designer\" for her site.\n\nAs Ringley attracted a following both on and off the Internet, more than 100 media outlets from \"The Wall Street Journal\" to \"Modern Ferret\" ran features. Ringley owned several ferrets and \"Modern Ferret\" featured Jenni and one of her pets on the front cover. As an actress, she was cast in \"Rear Windows '98,\" a 1998 episode of the TV series \"Diagnosis Murder\", portraying Joannecam, a fictionalized version of herself. She also hosted her own Internet talk show titled The Jennishow on The Sync, an early webcasting network based in Laurel, Maryland.\n\nRingley's standard of living improved with a new larger apartment, expensive furniture and several business trips to Amsterdam with her accountant. She claimed that the experience improved her self-image and self body image. Ringley began to take trips to visit other cam girls, including Ana Voog of Anacam.com.\n\nAt the height of her popularity, an estimated three to four million people watched JenniCam.org daily. She eventually purchased the domain jennicam.com as well. She appeared July 31, 1998 as a guest on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\". At the end of the interview, and even after having been corrected once, Letterman plugged the site as Jennicam.net instead of the correct Jennicam.com (Ringley owned both Jennicam.com and Jennicam.org). People visiting the previously non-existent Jennicam.net found a pornographic site with the greeting, \"Thanks Dave\".\n\nShe also appeared on \"The Today Show\" and \"World News Tonight With Peter Jennings\".\n\nIn 1999, clips from The Jennishow were included in the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition \"Fame After Photography.\" \n\nWhen Ringley moved to Sacramento, California, she documented the boxing of her possessions with free live streaming and full audio. Ringley received some criticism from fans when she became involved with Dex, a man who was the fiancé of a fellow webcammer and friend who helped her move to California.\n\nShe shut down her site on December 31, 2003, citing PayPal's new anti-nudity policy.\n\nSince the end of 2003, Ringley has avoided having a presence on the Internet and on social media and tries to stay out of public spotlight.\n\nRingley worked for a web developer after a brief stint as a case worker for a social services agency in Sacramento. Out of the public eye, she stated, \"I really am enjoying my privacy now. I don't have a web page; I don't have a MySpace page. It's a completely different feeling, and I think I'm enjoying it.\"\n\nIn December 2014, Ringley spoke to the podcast Reply All about her experiences with Jennicam; the podcast noted that Jenny \"is almost entirely absent from the Internet ... just the way she likes it.\"\n\nIn a rare 2016 interview with the BBC, Ringley described herself as a programmer in California and married to a man with the very common surname of Johnson.\n\n\n"}

Chittilappilly is a recipient of the \"Rashtriya Samman\" award from the Government of India for being among the highest taxpayers and the \"Newsmaker of the Year 2011\" award from Malayala Manorama. As the chairman of the Stray Dog Free movement, he has advocated for government action to address the \"menace\" of stray dogs in his home state of Kerala, and has criticized legislation forbidding the killing of stray dogs.\n\nKochouseph Chittilappilly was born to C. O. Thomas in Parappur, a suburb of Thrissur in the south Indian state of Kerala in 1950. His early schooling was at the local church school after which he graduated from Christ College, Irinjalakuda and followed it with a master's degree in Physics from St. Thomas College, Thrissur in 1970. His career kick started in 1973 at Telics, a Thiruvananthapuram based electronics company manufacturing voltage stabilizers and emergency lamps, in the capacity of a supervisor where he worked for three years.\n\nIn 1977, he founded V-Guard Industries, a small electronics manufacturing unit for the production of voltage stabilizers with a capital of 100,000. The company which had 2 employees at its modest manufacturing facility in Thrissur at inception, grew over the years to become the largest selling stabilizer brand in India. The company claims to have 500 distributors, 3000 dealers, 20,000 retailers and a network of service centres across India supporting a product range composed of Pumps and Motors, Electric and Solar Water Heaters, Wiring Cables, UPS, and Ceiling Fans. The company has an Indian market share of 20 percent in UPS segment, 15 percent in pumps, 12 percent in water heaters and 7 percent in wiring cables segments.\n\nChittilapilly is reported to have introduced a new business model by total product outsourcing coupled with in-house quality control when his factories were shut down following a workers' strike in the 1980s. Later, diversifying the business, he started the first water theme park in the state of Kerala under the name, \"Veegaland\", in 2000. Another park on a larger scale, Wonderla, was subsequently started in Bengaluru. Veegaland has since been renamed as Wonderla Kochi, in an effort to establish the name as a brand.

The foundation, based in Kakkanadu, Kochi, also oversees the activities of Thomas Chittilapilly Trust, another charitable venture of Chittilapilly which is named after his father and runs two institutions, an old age home where elderly people are housed and provided with sustenance and medical care, and \"Shantimandiram\", a home for destitute children where they are provided with shelter, education and food. The institutions are managed by the Sisters of Nirmala Province, a provincialate of catholic nuns located at Kolazhy in Thrissur. It has also instituted an organ donation award for recognising people who come forward for organ donation and to promote organ donation among people. The foundation offers awards for those who voluntarily donate their own organs or to families who donate the organs of their brain-dead relatives; the awards carry cash components ranging from 100,000 to 500,000, totaling 3.7 million every year.\n\nIn 2011, Chittilapilly donated one of his kidneys to a stranger, a truck driver, and started an organ donor chain - where one of the family members of the recipient had to donate an organ thereby forming a donor chain. As a part of the programme, Chittilapilly donated one of his kidneys to a truck driver, becoming the first depositor with the Kidney Federation of India (KFI) and is now closely associated with the movement.\n\nChittilappilly is the chairman of the Stray Dog Free movement, which advocates action against the risks allegedly posed by stray dogs in Kerala, including the amendment of legislation forbidding the killing of these dogs. The movement has pointed to the danger of rabies and referred to stray dogs as a \"menace\". Chittilappilly has staged hunger strikes to protest this legislation, and what he claims is governmental failure to address this issue. He has stated that the government's actions amount to valuing stray dogs over human lives and property. He has encouraged citizens to pressure the government to amend these laws, and to kill stray dogs themselves despite the accompanying 50-rupee fine. Chittilappilly has been arrested under statutes preventing cruelty to animals after tying four stray dogs in front of a police station.\n\nThe movement is related to governmental plans to cull stray dogs which have prompted an international campaign to \"Boycott Kerala Tourism\". Opponents of the Stray Dog Free movement have argued that vaccination and spay/neuter campaigns are a more effective and humane method of controlling the stray dog population. Members of the Stray Dog Free movement have alleged that opposition is being funded by rabies vaccine manufacturers.\n\nChittilapilly is a recipient of \"Rashtriya Samman\" from the Government of India for being the highest tax payer in India. He was selected as the \"Malayala Manorama Newsmaker of the Year 2011\", the year he became an organ donor, the award reaching him in 2012. He is also a recipient of awards such as \"Millennium Businessman of Kerala\" from Business Deepika, \"Tourism Man of the Year 2000\" from Destination Kerala, \"Manager of the Year 2000\" from the Travancore Management Association and \"Tourism Man of the Year 2011\" from the Association of Tourism Trade Organisations, India (ATTOI).\n\n\n"}

Suffering heavy losses, the remaining fleet retreated and prepared for next assault again on 1281. Again on 1281, the Japanese samurais were more than prepared to hold off an invasion attempt by the Kublai Khan's fleet, and which they did so with great success.\nEven though the campaign failed in the end due to stiff Japanese resistance, Kublai Khan's campaigns saw the development of gunpowder as a form of weaponry.\n\nBesides Song China and Japan, Kublai Khan also launched campaigns against Burma, Java and Vietnam. A series of military conflicts between the Yuan dynasty and the Pagan Empire took place between 1277 and 1287, collectively known as the First Mongol invasion of Burma. The invasion toppled the 250-year-old Pagan Empire and the Mongols occupied Upper Burma. However, Mongol invasions of both Java and Vietnam resulted in failure. Nevertheless, both the Trần dynasty (Đại Việt) and Champa decided to accept the nominal supremacy of the Yuan dynasty in order to avoid further conflicts.\n"}

It was a \"Turkish Pine\" of species \"Pinus brutia\".\n\nPines which are planted as a memorial to the Australian and New Zealand soldiers who fought in Gallipoli are also known as \"Lone Pines\" or \"Gallipoli Pines\". However, there are at least two species of pine in that locality—in addition to \"Turkish Pine\" \"Pinus brutia\", the \"Aleppo Pine\" \"Pinus halepensis\" is also common. Branches from \"Allepo\" pines were also used by the Turks to protect their trenches, and cones and seeds from \"Allepo\" pines are common at \"Lone Pine\" memorials in Australia, in particular, the tree at the Australian War Memorial.\n\nThe tree at the Lone Pine Cemetery at Gallipoli is of a third species—Stone pine \"Pinus pinea\".\n\nThe \"original\" Lone Pine, a \"Turkish Pine\" of species \"Pinus brutia\", was the sole survivor of a group of trees that had been cut down by Turkish soldiers who had used the timber and branches to cover their trenches during the battle. They has also cut down other trees to do this, most particularly \"Aleppo Pines\" \"Pinus halepensis\". The tree was obliterated during the battle; however, pine cones that had remained attached to the cut branches over the trenches were retrieved by various Australian soldiers and brought home to Australia. The resultant seedlings sent home by one soldier were found to be Turkish pines, but those sent home by a pair of soldiers were found to be \"Pinus halepensis\" (Aleppo pine). Initially, Turkish pines were regarded as a subspecies of \"Pinus halepensis\" (Aleppo pine), but now they are usually classified as a distinct species, \"Pinus brutia\".\n\nAt the Lone Pine Cemetery on the Gallipoli peninsula, a solitary pine was planted in the 1920s to symbolise the original Lone Pine. This tree was inspected in 1987 by an Australian botanist and confirmed to be a stone pine (\"Pinus pinea\").\n\nKeith McDowell, an Australian soldier of the 23rd Battalion who fought at Gallipoli, brought a pine cone from the battle site home to Australia. Many years later seeds from the cone were planted by his wife's aunt Emma Gray of Grassmere, near Warrnambool, Victoria and five seedlings emerged, with four surviving. These seedlings were planted in four different locations in Victoria: Wattle Park, Melbourne (8 May 1933), the Shrine of Remembrance (11 June 1933), the Soldiers Memorial Hall at The Sisters near Terang (18 June 1933) and Warrnambool Botanic Gardens (23 January 1934).\n\nThe tree at the Shrine Reserve was planted near the north-east corner of the building by Lieutenant-General Sir Stanley Savige, founder of Melbourne Legacy, at a formal ceremony. In 2005 the tree required cable bracing following the loss of a major limb and in August 2012, despite measures taken to try to save the tree from the effects of disease caused by the fungus \"Diplodia pinea\", it was removed. A \"grandchild tree\" was planted nearby in 2006. A Middle Park man, Andrew Lees, collected cones from the broken limb in 2005 and by 2015 had managed to germinate about 20 seedlings.\n\nAnother soldier, Lance Corporal Benjamin Smith from the 3rd Battalion, also retrieved a cone from the battle site and sent it back to his mother in Australia, (Mrs McMullen), who had lost another son at the battle. Seeds from the cone were planted by her in 1928, from which two seedlings were raised. One was presented to her home town of Inverell, New South Wales and the other was forwarded to Canberra where it was planted by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester at the Australian War Memorial (AWM) in October 1934. The AWM lone pine lost two of its large lower limbs by strong winds preceding a thunderstorm on 27 December 2008. However, tree surgeons were able to save the historic tree.\n\nBoth Melbourne Legacy and the Yarralumla Nursery in Canberra have raised and grown seedlings over a number of years, sourced from the tree at the Shrine of Remembrance and the Australian War Memorial respectively, which they have presented to schools as well as ex-service and other organisations throughout Australia.\n\nOther \"Lone Pines\" include:\n\n\"Lone Pines\" with accompanying plaques:\nIn Auckland, two trees identified as \"Lone Pines\" have been planted. One is a \"Pinus canariensis\" planted at Waikumete cemetery in 1961 and another is a \"Pinus radiata\" at Auckland War Memorial Museum, planted on Anzac Day in 1950. A tree identified as \"The Anzac Pine\" stands on Te Mata Peak at Havelock North in Hawkes Bay. Although a specimen of \"Pinus brutia\" was originally planted, the current tree is identified as the species \"Pinus radiata\". Two specimens of \"Pinus halepensis\", planted in 1951, are located at the Lone Pine Memorial at the cemetery in Taradale, and further specimens are located at King Edward Park in Stratford and Queens Park in Wanganui.\nThere is a \"Lone Pine\" at the Paeroa golf course, at the ladies tee, on the second hole. This tree appears to be New Zealand's only authentic \"Pinus brutia\" that can be traced back to the original pines, according to \"Excerpts from NZ Journal of Forestry, May 2007\".\nAlso, in Victoria Park, Christchurch, there is a plaque which claims that the nearby pine tree was grown from a seedling of the Gallipoli Lone Pine.\n"}

{"id": "633920", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633920", "title": "Operation Moses", "text": "Operation Moses\n\nOperation Moses (, \"Mivtza Moshe\") refers to the covert evacuation of Ethiopian Jews (known as the \"Beta Israel\" community or \"Falashas\") from Sudan during a civil war that caused a famine in 1984. Originally called \"Gur Aryeh Yehuda\" (“Cub of the Lion of Judah”) by Israelis, the United Jewish Appeal changed the name to “Operation Moses.”\n\nThe operation, named after the biblical figure Moses, was a cooperative effort between the Israel Defense Forces, the Central Intelligence Agency, the United States embassy in Khartoum, mercenaries, and Sudanese state security forces. Years after the operation completed, it was revealed that Sudanese Muslims and secret police of Sudan also played a role in facilitating the mass migration of Ethiopian Jews out of Sudan. Operation Moses was the brainchild of then Associate U.S. Coordinator for Refugee Affairs, Richard Krieger. After receiving accounts of the persecution of Ethiopian Jews in the refugee camps, Krieger came up with the idea of an airlift and met with Mossad and Sudanese representatives to facilitate the Operation.\n\nAfter a secret Israeli cabinet meeting in November 1984, the decision was made to go forward with Operation Moses. Beginning November 21, 1984, it involved the air transport by Trans European Airways of some 8,000 Ethiopian Jews from Sudan via Brussels to Israel, ending January 5, 1985.\n\nOver those seven weeks, over 30 flights brought about 200 Ethiopian Jews at a time to Israel. Trans European Airways had flown out of Sudan previously with Muslims making the pilgrimage to Mecca, so using TEA was a logical solution for this semi-covert operation because it would not provoke questions from the airport authorities. Before this operation, there were approximately as few as 250 Ethiopian immigrants in Israel. Thousands of Beta Israel had fled Ethiopia on foot for refugee camps in Sudan, a journey which usually took anywhere from two weeks to a month. It is estimated as many as 4,000 died during the trek, due to violence and illness along the way. Sudan secretly allowed Israel to evacuate the refugees. Two days after the airlifts began, Jewish journalists wrote about “the mass rescue of thousands of Ethiopian Jews.”\n\nOperation Moses ended on Friday, January 5, 1985, after Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres held a press conference confirming the airlift while asking people not to talk about it. Sudan killed the airlift moments after Peres stopped speaking, ending it prematurely as the news began to reach their Arab allies. Once the story broke in the media, Arab countries pressured Sudan to stop the airlift. Although thousands made it successfully to Israel, many children died in the camps or during the flight to Israel, and it was reported that their parents brought their bodies down from the aircraft with them. Some 1,000 Ethiopian Jews were left behind, approximately 500 of whom were evacuated later in the U.S.-led Operation Joshua. More than 1,000 so-called \"orphans of circumstance\" existed in Israel, children separated from their families still in Africa, until five years later Operation Solomon took 14,324 more Jews to Israel in 1991. Operation Solomon in 1991 cost Israel $26 million to pay off the dictator-led government, while Operation Moses had been the least expensive of all rescue operations undertaken by Israel to aid Jews in other countries.\n\nThis operation was the subject of an Israeli-French film titled \"Live and Become\", directed by Romanian-born Radu Mihăileanu. The film centers on an Ethiopian child whose Christian mother passes him as a Jew so he can immigrate to Israel along with the Jews in order to escape the famine that is looming in Ethiopia. The film went on to win the 2005 award for Best Film at the Copenhagen International Film Festival.\n\nIn the book \"World War Z\" by Max Brooks, the evacuation of African Jews to Israel in response to the outbreak of the titular epidemic is referred to as Operation Moses II.\n\n\n\n"}

The event took place on March 16, 2003 in Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico. In a break from tradition that year's Rey de Reyes tournament featured six former Rey de Reyes winners wrestling each other to determine 2003's Rey de Reyes. The final match saw La Parka, Jr. compete against Abismo Negro.\n\nStarting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican \"Lucha Libre\", or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's \"Rey\". Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual \"Reina de Reinas\" (\"Queen of Queens\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2003 show was the seventh Rey de Reyes show in the series.\n\nThe Rey de Reyes show featured at least four professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portray either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portrayed the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

The \"Rocket Racers\" were slated to compete in the air and on a virtual racetrack easily viewed by a live audience as well as projected on large screen and handheld electronic displays.\n\nThree prototype canard-style \"Rocket Racer\" aircraft were built between 2006 and 2010.\n\nThe league had planned to hold its inaugural race season in 2008 with four races, but encountered financial difficulties that delayed fielding of \"Rocket Racers\" by the six teams that had been previously announced. With the addition of venture capital funding in mid-2009, technology development continued and one exhibition occurred in 2010, with another round of plans for an inaugural season of races in 2011. The 2011 races were, in the end, never scheduled, and by 2014, the league was defunct.\n\nProjected to be an hour and one half in length, the races were intended to be between Rocket Racer planes that used liquid oxygen and either kerosene or ethanol fuel with a burn time of four minutes. The rocketplanes were expected to cost less than US$1 million each. The planes were based on the fixed-gear Velocity SE modified by XCOR Aerospace and the retractible gear Velocity XL modified by Armadillo Aerospace for the purpose of rocket racing. The Velocity airframe was derived from a commercially available kit plane that traced its design heritage to the Rutan Long-EZ, which had been modified to accept rocket power and custom avionics. In order to provide the airframes, RRL purchased the aircraft's manufacturer, Velocity Aircraft, in April 2008.\n\nThe RRL had been called \"NASCAR with rockets\", XCOR Aerospace flew the Rocket Racer for a public audience at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Airshow at Oshkosh, Wisconsin. If league competition were to begin, Whitelaw indicated tournament semifinals would be held each September in Nevada, with finals each October in New Mexico at the X Prize Cup competing for a $2 million championship purse.\n\nRaces were to have taken place on a race course two miles (3 km) long, one mile (1.6 km) wide, and in the air. A typical race would take about one hour, and fans would be able to see multiple camera views, including cockpit, \"on-track,\" \"side-by-side\" and wing-angle views.\n\nAdditionally, a computer game had been planned which was to have interfaced with racer positional data in real time over the internet, allowing players to virtually compete with the rocket pilots.\n\nThe proposed \"track\" for a typical Rocket Race was to have begun with a staggered start. Pilots were to take off in pairs a few minutes apart, they would be competing against the clock but would maneuver around each other much like NASCAR. The pilots would be guided by a virtual three-dimensional \"track\" projected in their head-up display. Each racer was to have a separate track to follow but the courses were planned to be close together to build excitement.\n\n, there were six teams registered to compete in the inaugural 2008 race season, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing, Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing and Thunderhawk Rocket Racing. \n\n, RRL claimed that \"official team recruitment will commence as the production-level Rocket Racers near completion.\" listing five \"candidate teams of the RRL franchise\": Bridenstine Rocket Racing, Santa Fe Racing, Rocket Star Racing, Team Extreme Rocket Racing, and Canada-based Beyond Gravity Rocket Racing.\n\nThe formation of the league was announced by Granger Whitelaw, and Peter Diamandis, founder of the Ansari X-Prize, in October 2005 in partnership with the Reno Air Races. According to Diamandis, the purpose of the league was to \"inspire people of all ages to once again look up into the sky and find inspiration and excitement.\"\n\nInitial plans called for a four-team league finals in 2006, to be followed by 10 teams competing in 2007, with video games based on the competition also out in 2007.\nIn 2006, analysts identified doubts about the economics of the venture, and especially of the ability of RRL to attract a large fanbase similar to IndyCar and NASCAR\nIn the event, no races occurred in either 2006 or 2007.\n\nIn April 2008, the league stated that it was \"ready for competition [announcing] four exhibition races will be held later [in the] year, one in Las Cruces.\"\n\nOn April 14, 2008, the Racing Rocket Racing Composite Corporation, a subsidiary of the Rocket Racing League, acquired Velocity Aircraft. The RRL announced their goal was to \"produce an airframe that will be consistent for all competing Rocket Racers.\"\n\nOn May 26, 2010, a Velocity employee posted to the builder's email-list a note from Scott and Duane Swing that stated that they had bought back full ownership of Velocity Inc from Rocket Racing League. The RRL now owns no share of Velocity Inc.\n\nNone of the four planned 2008 races were actually run. The Rocket Racing League had difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient financial backing, from both investors and sponsors, in order to get an initial racing season firmly scheduled in 2008, 2009, or 2010. Some progress with the rocket and aircraft technology continued however, but by 2014, the league had gone defunct.\n\nThe league twice failed to complete construction of six hangars contracted to be built on land adjacent to Spaceport America near Las Cruces, New Mexico. As of January 2009, the league was at risk of having their leases with the City of Las Cruces terminated.\n\nIn July 2009, the league announced the closing of a venture capital financing round of US$5.5 million. The funds were to be used for ongoing operations and for the development of a next-generation Rocket Racer.\n, Peter Diamandis suggested that 2010 could be the year that we see \"more than one racer in the air and possibly in exhibition races.\" Non-exhibition \"live\" races were to occur as early as 2011.\nAlso in February, the Tulsa Air and Space Museum and Planetarium (TASM) announced that it would partner with the Rocket Racing League to host an exhibition flight of a Rocket Racer at the QuikTrip Air and Rocket Show at Tulsa International Airport in April 2010.\n\nThe Rocket Racing League announced a \"2010 World Exhibition Tour\" on April 24, 2010, when they unveiled their \"Mark-III X-racer\" rocket plane at the QuikTrip Air & Rocket Racing Show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The RRL exhibition flights at Tulsa were the first simultaneous flights of two rocket-powered airplanes in the history of peacetime aviation. RRL duplicated this historic feat later that day. The league's intent in such exhibitions was to \"build up the league's fan base, in addition to perfecting operations and technologies, before the league's official launch in 2012.\" The April event in Tulsa was the only RRL exhibition of 2010.\n\nThe league's financial difficulties continued in 2011 and no races were organized.\n\nBy 2014, persons formerly involved with the league had made public statements that the league had failed and was now defunct.\n\nThe Rocket Racing League had been developing prototype \"Rocket Racers\" since 2006, working with one airframe manufacturer and two rocket engine producers on three prototype aircraft to date. All three of the airframes have been of the canard configuration to more easily accommodate the rocket propulsion technology.\n\nA fifth model was proposed, but not built, in 2011: the Mark-V X-Racer.\n\nXCOR Aerospace developed the XCOR EZ-Rocket, later flown under Rocket Racing League sponsorship as an X-Racer prototype rocketplane. First flight was July 21, 2001 at Mojave Airport in Mojave, California.\nThis XCOR trchnology demonstrator was a converted Rutan Long-EZ and, in its final version, utilized two 400 lbf (1.8 kN) thrust XCOR Aerospace isopropyl-alcohol-powered rocket engines of engine type XR-4A3.\nXCOR flew the EZ-Rocket for several years in development and demonstration flights, including, in collaboration with the RRL, at the 2005 X-Prize Cup in New Mexico.\n\nBy 2006, the design-point for the RRL racer had become a single rocket engine utilizing kerosene as the rocket fuel, carrying of liquid oxygen in its flight oxidizer tank.\n\nThe first RRL prototype built, known as the Mark-I X-Racer, was built on a Velocity SE airframe and was also powered by XCOR Aerospace rocket technology, a regeneratively-cooled and pump-fed XR-4K14 rocket engine. This rocket-powered aircraft flew several demonstration flights at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show.\nThe total thrust for the single-engine Mark-I X-Racer was , approximately twice that of the EZ-Rocket.\n\n, the Rocket Racing League was utilizing a highly modified Velocity XL fixed-gear airframe and an Armadillo Aerospace 2,500 pound thrust liquid oxygen (LOX) and ethanol rocket engine in both its Mark-II X-Racer and Mark-III X-Racer demonstration vehicles.\nThe Mark-II and Mark-III racers could take off just 4 seconds after the rocket engine was ignited; both vehicles were limited to a top speed of .\nThe rocket engine was a LOX-Ethanol, film-cooled, pressure-fed, blow-down design with a 10 to -long exhaust plume. Plume-seeding technology allowed the plume color to vary from red to green to yellow to better facilitate race spectators in keeping track of specific racers while in the air.\n\nThe Mark-II (N205MB) racer utilized a standard fixed-gear XL airframe, modified for the addition of the Armadillo rocket propulsion. The Mark-III (N133XP) airframe was modified during manufacturing at Velocity Aircraft explicitly for use as a Rocket Racer, with canopy top, center seat and control stick, and other enhancements.\n\nThe Mark-V proposed design resembles \"a sleek, rocket-powered sailplane\" and may be built at Velocity Aircraft, although no firm contracts are in place to do so .\n\n"}

They arrived in Honolulu in 1842. \nHis maternal great-uncle was minister Samuel John Mills (1783–1818), who took part in the Haystack Prayer Meeting which led to the formation of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the group that sent the first American missionaries to Hawaii.\n\nHe was educated at Punahou School from 1856 to 1863.\nOn September 5, 1872 he married Harriet Melinda Baldwin (1846–1932), daughter of missionary Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886).\n\nThe Damons had four children: Samuel Edward Damon (born June 1, 1873), Mary Mills Damon (born November 23, 1877), Henry Fowler Damon (born January 16, 1883) and Douglas Wilfred Damon.\nHis wife's brother Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) founded Alexander & Baldwin. This was one of the \"Big Five\" corporations that dominated the economy of territorial Hawaii.\n\nDamon started work as a clerk in the W. N. Ladd store in Honolulu, run by the son of the founder of ill-fated Ladd & Co.\nIn 1871 he went to work for the bank of Charles Reed Bishop, the only one in the Hawaiian Islands at the time. By 1881 he became a full partner in Bishop's bank.\nHe invested in and served on the board of directors of sugarcane plantations and the Oahu Railway and Land Company, and was vice president of his brother-in-law's Hawaiian Sugar Company.\n\nIn 1884, he inherited over of the area known as Moanalua from Bernice Pauahi Bishop. She was the wife of his business partner, and a Hawaiian princess who inherited the land from King Kamehameha I.\nDamon was executor of Princess Pauahi's will, and trustee of the estate through 1916. Most of her land went to fund the Kamehameha Schools.\nHe successfully appealed a lawsuit to the supreme court to demand exclusive fishing rights to the area offshore of Moanalua.\n\nIn an even more unusual case, Charles Brenig, who had come to Hawaii under the name Simeon Weibert, died and left much of his estate to Damon. The will was contested by Brenig's widow and son, but appeals were denied.\n\nWhen Bishop moved to San Francisco in 1893 Damon acquired all shares of the Bishop bank.\nThe bank later became the First Hawaiian Bank, and Damon's share was sold to BNP Paribas in 2001.\n\nOn August 12, 1884 King Kalākaua made Damon a member of the Privy Council, where he served until March 7, 1891.\nHe became a member of the board of education on July 7, 1887 and board of Health December 28, 1887.\nHe was appointed minister of finance on July 22, 1889, replacing amateur geologist and businessman William Lowthian Green.\nHe served until being replaced by Godfrey Brown on June 17, 1890.\n\nHe kept on good terms with Queen Liliuokalani (his father had performed her wedding ceremony). He was out of town when the Committee of Safety deposed her. Since he knew people on both sides, he helped negotiate a peaceful outcome, where Liliuokalani surrendered under protest to the US Government.\n\nAfter the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he was vice president of the Provisional Government of Hawaii from February 4, 1893 to May 29, 1893 when he again became minister of finance. He was also on the executive council of Sanford B. Dole (which replaced the privy council of the monarchy) until May 22, 1895.\nWhen it was apparent that the United States was not going to annex the islands immediately, he continued in the Republic of Hawaii government to September 12, 1896. James A. King replaced him temporarily in June 1896. He was made a special envoy to attend the diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria in London. On August 11, 1897 he held the post for a third time, until November 13, 1899.\nHe was Hawaii's last minister of finance, serving once more from December 21, 1899 until June 14, 1900 after the Hawaiian Organic Act established the government of the Territory of Hawaii and the cabinet was abolished.\n\nHis son Samuel Edward \"Ned\" Damon graduated from Punahou and then Yale. He studied accounting in Glasgow, Scotland where he married Gertrude MacKinnon on January 17, 1899. They had four children, although one died young. He returned to work in the family bank, but was stabbed to death on September 27, 1904.\n\nAfter S. M. Damon died July 1, 1924, his estate (then estimated worth over US$250 million) was left in trust to his grandchildren. At one time it was the fourth largest private landowner in Hawaii.\nSon Henry Fowler Damon graduated from Yale, had children Harriet Damon \"Haku\" Baldwin (1913–2003), Frances (Damon) Holt, Joan (Damon) Haig, and Henry E. Damon, and died December 19, 1926. Douglas Wilfred Damon died September 21, 1936.\n\nThe property became very valuable as Honolulu was developed in the 20th century. Parts of Moanalua became Fort Kamehameha, Honolulu International Airport, Tripler Army Medical Center, Moanalua High School, the Salt Lake, Hawaii development, and Moanalua Gardens. \nIn 2003, the office buildings alone were sold to the Real estate investment trust HRPT for over $480 million.\nTrustees of the estate included retired General Frederick C. Weyand, great-grandson David M. Haig, former bank president Walter Dods, and local attorney Paul Mullin Ganley.\nHis last surviving grandchild, Joan Damon Haig, died on November 9, 2004.\n\nThe estate had about 20 beneficiaries with annual total income of over $34 million, as plans were made for its distribution.\nHowever, only one grandchild, (Samuel Renny Damon) survived from his son Samuel, while four descended from son Henry. A lawsuit was filed (appealed to the Supreme Court of Hawaii) to determine how to divide the shares: equal shares for each great-grandchild, five shares for each grandchild, or half for each set of descendants by his two children. The 1914 will had almost no punctuation in its ten pages.\nThe US Supreme Court refused to hear the case, so the estate, estimated worth $900 million in 2006, was distributed with half to descendants of each son.\n\nThe estate had bought Kahuku ranch on Hawaii island for $1.3 million in 1958 from James W. Glover.\nIt is located on the southeast rift zone of Mauna Loa volcano, with headquarters at . \nThe estate sold about of the ranch in 2003 to the US Government (with financing from the Nature Conservancy) to expand Hawaii Volcanoes National Park for $22 million. It was the largest conservation land deal in Hawaii's history, enlarging the park by more than 50%. Some was sold for residences, and some remains as a tourist accommodation.\nIn 2006 Damon's coin collection alone was auctioned off for $3,884,000 by Doyle New York. It included an 1876 proof set from the US centennial.\nIn 2007, the estate donated a collection of artifacts to the Bernice P. Bishop Museum. Damon was a founding trustee of the museum.\n\n\n"}

It describes a practical joke allegedly perpetrated in 1824, by a retired ship carpenter named Lozier. According to the story, in the 1820s a rumor began circulating among city merchants that the weight of the urban district was causing southern Manhattan Island to sink, near the Battery. It was believed that by cutting the island, towing it out, rotating it 180 degrees, and putting it back in place that Manhattan would be stabilized, and that the thin part of the island could be condemned. Surprisingly, the main concern was not the futility of the idea but of Long Island's being in the way. Lozier finally assembled a large workforce and logistical support. At a massive groundbreaking ceremony, Lozier did not show up, but hid in Brooklyn and did not return for months.\n\nThe story did not appear in any known newspapers (although the press supposedly did not report on such pranks in that era) and no records have been found to confirm the existence of the individuals involved. This has led to speculation that the incident never occurred and the original report of the hoax was itself a hoax, which is the conclusion Joel Rose suggests in his book, \"New York Sawed in Half: An Urban Historical\" (2001). The hoax was first documented in Thomas F. De Voe's (1811-1892) volume \"The Market Book\" (1862), as conveyed by his uncle who was Lozier's supposed associate, and was told again in Herbert Asbury's work \"All Around The Town: Murder, Scandal, Riot and Mayhem in Old New York\" (1934, reissued as a Sequel to \"Gangs of New York\"). Another condensed retelling occurs in the 1960s Reader's Digest book, \"Scoundrels and Scallywags: 51 Stories of the Most Fascinating Characters of Hoax and Fraud\" (1968).\n\n"}
{"id": "8583493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8583493", "title": "Shakespeare's Will (play)", "text": "Shakespeare's Will (play)\n\nShakespeare's Will is a play by Canadian writer Vern Thiessen. It was commissioned by Geoffrey Brumlik, then Artistic Director of the River City Shakespeare Festival in Edmonton as a performance vehicle for Jan Alexandra Smith and premiered at the Citadel Theatre in February 2005. It has been regularly revived and was performed at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 2011. \"Shakespeare's Will\" was published in 2002 by Playwrights Canada Press.\n\nThe American premiere of \"Shakespeare's Will\" was produced at Theatre 40 in Beverly Hills, California. The production starred Jeanmarie Simpson, was produced by Leonard Nimoy and directed by Susan Bay. Nimoy said he agreed to produce the show because 'It’s a very beautiful piece, very beautifully written, very moving, and funny.\" The production led to a long-term creative collaboration between Nimoy and Thiessen which later included a specially commissioned play.\n\n\"Shakespeare's Will\" is a one-woman monodrama that focuses on Anne Hathaway on the day of her husband William Shakespeare's funeral. Its form has been described as a \"poetic monologue that is fragmentary, and richly allusive.\" The audience shares details of her historically-unknown personal life, a mixture of general information about the lives of women in Elizabethan England, fictional dramatic twists, and twenty-first century interpretations. \n\nThe drama focuses on the will handed to William Shakespeare’s widow Anne as she leaves his funeral. She is surprised by its existence and that his sister Joan should give it to her with a noticeably odd smile. Joan promises to visit in an hour.\n\nAnne resists reading the will, remembering instead the passion and the vows she shared with her husband, Catholic in public but 'their own kind of marriage' in private. These unusual vows accommodated their desires as individuals, but left Anne alone in Stratford to raise their three children. She relives the decision points where Bill’s London life became a separate existence. When plague sweeps the country, she must find a way to protect the children without news or support from William and relates her decision to take them to the seashore, far from disease and death. Her flight repeats her own childhood journey, when her father brought her and her siblings to the sea and away from the plague which killed her mother. \n\nAn hour later, Anne must read the will. She appreciates Bill’s intention to secure the honours he has earned through his daughter’s possible sons. She understands his bequests until she reads his provision for the house. Her loathed sister-in-law will inherit her prized house, while she is deeded the second best bed. The order of William's estate can only be punishment for their son’s death from drowning. He has broken their pact. Anne’s rage at his post-mortem betrayal, after she honourably maintained her side of their vows, gives her the strength to break free from the constraints of her situation as well. She decides to return to the sea to make a life for herself.\n\nThe play shows us William’s success in London through a domestic lens, where Anne’s children, garden, bees and marketing are our focus. Anne’s own childhood journey to the sea supplies a pattern of water-based imagery which resolves in the final sequence of the play; it is a mirror and cyclic resolution to Bill’s love affair with words.\n\nScholar Anne Wilson interprets the play as an exploration of recent debate in Canada about non-traditional marriages and relationships, writing that 'the play's politics and key adaptive gestures coincide with transformations in Canada around orthodoxies associated with gender roles and families'. Wilson also notes Thiessen's exploration of the relationship between sexual freedom and patriarchal norms of male succession. She draws attention to the repeated emphasis on imagery of the sea, flow, and voyages to express the fluid nature of desire and human intimacies.\n\nReviewer James Wenley praised the show as 'catnip for Shakespeare fans', writing that Anne emerges from the play a vivid and humanized character. He found Theissen's speculation of the Shakespeare marriage fascinating, believable, and delivering 'a very palpable sense of the time and place'.\n\nConversely, reviewer John Coulbourn believed that \"not much of it rings true, either to the heart or to the period of the piece\", considering that Anne's musings were too generic to convince. \n\nJ. Kelly Nestruck objected to the \"anachronistic proto-feminist\" portrayal of Hathaway, arguing that \"there's no getting away from the fact that Shakespeare's Will is ultimately a drama once removed. Hathaway is of interest only because of whom she married.\"\n\nCritic Katherine Scheil says that the play 'recasts the poet's domestic life into a familiar narrative for a twenty-first-century audience, a sort of inspirational 'Chicken Soup for the Lonely Married Woman' based on the Shakespeare marriage', setting up Shakespeare as a 'vengeful husband' who fails to appreciate the sacrifices his wife made. However, she notes in conclusion that audiences seem receptive to a play about a stay-at-home mother's inspirational struggle and triumph, despite its unflattering rendition of the man himself. \n\nThe play has been produced across Canada, ,in Wales, England, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States.\n\n"}
{"id": "1896891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1896891", "title": "Siege of Edessa", "text": "Siege of Edessa\n\nThe Siege of Edessa took place from November 28 to December 24, 1144, resulting in the fall of the capital of the crusader County of Edessa to Zengi, the atabeg of Mosul and Aleppo. This event was the catalyst for the Second Crusade.\n\nThe County of Edessa was the first of the crusader states to be established during and after the First Crusade. It dates from 1098 when Baldwin of Boulogne left the main army of the First Crusade and founded his own principality.\n\nEdessa was the most northerly, the weakest, and the least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the Ortoqids, Danishmends, and Seljuk Turks. Count Baldwin II and future count Joscelin of Courtenay were taken captive after their defeat at the Battle of Harran in 1104. Joscelin was captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the Battle of Azaz in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor Joscelin II was forced into an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, but in 1143 both the Byzantine emperor John II Comnenus and the King of Jerusalem Fulk of Anjou died. John II was succeeded by his son Manuel I Comnenus, who had to deal with consolidating power at home against his elder brothers, while Fulk was succeeded by his wife Melisende and his son Baldwin III. Joscelin had also quarreled with Raymond II of Tripoli and Raymond of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.\n\nIn 1144, Joscelin was able to make an alliance with Kara Arslan, the Ortoqid ruler of Diyarbakır, against the growing power and influence of Zengi. Joscelin marched out of Edessa with almost his entire army to support Kara Aslan against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to besiege Edessa, arriving on November 28. The city had been warned of his arrival and was prepared for a siege, but there was little they could do while Joscelin and the army were elsewhere.\n\nThe defense of the city was led by the Latin Archbishop Hugh, the Armenian Bishop John, and the Jacobite Bishop Basil. John and Basil ensured that none of the native Christians would desert to Zengi. When Joscelin heard of the siege he took the army to Turbessel, knowing that he could never dislodge Zengi without help from the other crusader states. In Jerusalem, Queen Melisende responded to Joscelin's appeal by sending an army led by Manasses of Hierges, Philip of Milly, and Elinand of Bures. Raymond of Antioch ignored the call for help, as his army was already occupied against the Byzantine Empire in Cilicia.\n\nZengi surrounded the entire city, realizing that there was no army defending it. He built siege engines and began to mine the walls, while his forces were joined by Kurdish and Turcoman reinforcements. The inhabitants of Edessa resisted as much as they could, but had no experience in siege warfare; the city’s numerous towers remained unmanned. They also had no knowledge of counter-mining, and part of the wall near the Gate of the Hours collapsed on December 24. Zengi's troops rushed into the city, killing all those who were unable to flee to the Citadel of Maniaces. Thousands more were suffocated or trampled to death in the panic, including Archbishop Hugh. Zengi ordered his men to stop the massacre, although all the Latin prisoners that he had taken were executed; the native Christians were allowed to live freely. The citadel was handed over on December 26. One of Zengi’s commanders, Zayn ad-Din Ali Kutchuk, was appointed governor, while Bishop Basil, apparently willing to give his loyalty to whoever ruled the city, was recognized as leader of the Christian population.\n\nIn January 1145 Zengi captured Saruj and besieged Birejik, but the army of Jerusalem had finally arrived and joined with Joscelin. Zengi also heard of trouble in Mosul, and rushed back to take control. There, he was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and \"al-Malik al-Mansur\", the victorious king. He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county to the west of the Euphrates from Turbessel, but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by the Muslims or sold to the Byzantines.\n\nZengi was assassinated by a slave in 1146 while besieging Qalat Jabar, and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son Nur ad-Din. Joscelin attempted to take back Edessa following Zengi's murder, and recaptured all but the citadel in October 1146. However, he had no help from the other crusader states, and his poorly planned expedition was driven out of Edessa by Nur ad-Din in November. Joscelin, fearing for the safety of the city's Christian Armenians, attempted to break a hole in Nur ad-Din's forces through which the natives could flee to safety. However, Joscelin's attempt failed and his fears came true when Nur al-Din's troops massacred the fleeing Armenians and forced the survivors into slavery. \n\nBy this time, news of the fall of Edessa reached Europe, and Raymond of Antioch had already sent a delegation including Hugh, Bishop of Jabala, to seek aid from Pope Eugene III. On December 1, 1145 Eugene issued the papal bull \"Quantum praedecessores\" calling for the Second Crusade. This crusade was led by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, but by 1148 it had ended in disaster, and Edessa was never recovered.\n\n"}

The Julian Meetings is one of several organisations set up to meet this interest and to foster Christian meditation. Others include Contemplative Outreach, which encourages centering prayer, the World Community for Christian Meditation and the Fellowship of Meditation.\n\nThe Julian Meetings were founded in 1973, when Hilary Wakeman (an Anglican who in 1994 became one of the first female priests in the Church of England) wrote a letter published in Christian newspapers in the United Kingdom asking if some readers might like to meet together for Christian meditation. This led to the formation of 11 local groups. About a year later the name \"The Julian Meetings\" was adopted, after Julian of Norwich, although the organisation is not specifically linked to Julian of Norwich's teachings.\n\nMeetings may include a reading, music, pictures or objects, to aid contemplation, but the focus is on silent contemplation.\n\nIn 2016 there were some 300 local groups, in the United Kingdom and other anglophone countries, as well as a number of individual members. Individual Julian Meetings are small, welcoming people of all denominations or none. They take place in peoples’ homes, in churches or chapels, meeting rooms and other places.\n\nAt the United Kingdom national gathering of the Julian Meetings, on 20 May 2017 in Derby, the keynote speaker was the poet, singer and academic Malcolm Guite, who spoke on poetry and prayer.\n\nFormal organisation is kept to a minimum, there are no paid staff, and the umbrella organisation is not a charity.

A Grade II* listed building, it has been described by the Theatres Trust as \"One of the most important surviving examples of Georgian theatre architecture\". It has a capacity for an audience of around 900.\n\nThe Theatre Royal was built to replace the Old Orchard Street Theatre, funded by a Tontine and elaborately decorated. The architect was George Dance the Younger, with John Palmer carrying out much of the work. It opened with a performance of Shakespeare's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps, which included the construction of the current entrance. Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892; more extensive building work, including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting, followed in 1902. Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt, the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the theatre was rarely very profitable. During World War II Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared, with shows including Noël Coward's \"Private Lives\" and \"Blyth Spirit\", a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as \"Charley's Aunt\", but audiences declined.\n\nIn 1979 the theatre was bought by a trust and, following public donations, it underwent refurbishment, with the rebuilding of the stage and the installation of a new taller fly tower for scenery and lighting. In 1997 a new 150 seat theatre, known as the Ustinov Studio, was opened. Further restoration work to the main auditorium was needed in 2010. In 2005 a children's theatre known as The Egg was opened. The complex also includes bars and restaurants. The Theatre Royal is host to several annual events, including the Family Theatre Festival and the Shakespeare Unplugged Festival.\n\nThe theatre was erected in 1805, replacing the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling the use of the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London. The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall. The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combined features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an annuity. As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent who later became George IV and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers. A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms.\n\nThe exterior of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. The ceiling was decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the potential damage from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park.\n\nThe opening night was on 12 October 1805 was a production of Richard III, with an unknown actor in the lead. Though not a success, the theatre soon established a good reputation and thrived under the management of William Wyatt Dimond. Early performances included appearances by the child actors Master Betty and Clara Fisher, with adult leads from prominent actors on the London stage including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. In addition to Shakespeare and other serious drama, the productions included opera and comedy with Joseph Grimaldi playing the clown in a pantomime of Mother Goose in November 1815.\n\nBetween the 1810s and 1850s there were a series of changes in ownership and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was the manager of the Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise.\n\nOn 18 April 1862 a major fire destroyed the interior of the building including the stage, scenery, wardrobe and library, leaving just the exterior walls still standing. A new company was formed to rebuild the theatre and a competition held for designs. The winner was C.J. Phipps and rebuilding, which included the new entrance on Sawclose, quickly followed. The present main entrance to the Theatre Royal, in Sawclose, was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was previously at Beau Nash's house. Pevsner criticizes the mouldings of window-frames, frieze and volutes of the door-hood brackets as \"characteristically overdone\", and mentions Wood citing its \"profuse ornament\" which was typical of a mason rather than an architect. Chute remained as manager and employed Charles Kean and Ellen Terry to play in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" on the opening night, 3 March 1863.\n\nInitially the reopened theatre struggled to become profitable despite appearances by Henry Irving among others. In 1885 William Lewis took over as the lessee and was followed, in 1892, by his son Egbert Lewis. They redecorated the theatre in 1892 and attracted larger regular audiences to performances of melodrama and comedy while starting to put on Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other attractions.\n\nIn 1902 the theatre closed for nine months to enable extensive building work to be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new fire curtain and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson.\n\nIn 1914 the theatre impresario Arthur Carlton, from Worcester, took over the lease. As he was responsible for 14 theatres around the country at the time, he appointed Mrs D. Valantine Munro as the local manager. Performances were maintained during World War I, and in 1916 Sarah Bernhardt portrayed a wounded male French soldier in \"Du Théâtre au Champ d'Honneur\". In the 1920s there were appearances by the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the theatre was not profitable and closed completely for six months. In 1938 the lease was taken over by Reg Maddox, whose family were involved with the theatre for the next 40 years. During World War II the theatre fared better, with appearances by prominent actors including Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike. In the Post-War years, receipts suffered as audiences dwindled in the face of competition from cinema and television. Unsuccessful proposals were made for a trust to run the theatre in 1968, and in the 1970s, shares in the owning company were bought by the property developer Charles Ware, who sold to Charles Clarke, a solicitor from Bristol. Clarke was responsible for a redecoration of the building, but as profits were still small, in 1976 he sold it to Louis I. Michaels, who ran the Haymarket Theatre in London.\n\nIn March 1979, the dilapidated theatre was purchased by a trust headed by Jeremy Fry for £155,000. The following year, an appeal was launched to raise money for renovations, including the complete rebuilding of the stage, installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher fly system, to allow major touring companies, including the Royal National Theatre under Peter Hall, to be booked to perform. The total projected cost was £3.5 million, of which £1.8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre. Money and donations in kind were received from the city council, Arts Council England, Bath Preservation Trust, Leche Trust, Historic buildings council, Manifold Trust, South-West Stonecleaning and Restoration Company and many individuals. Work on the building started to designs by Dowton and Hurst. However, as insufficient funds had been raised by 1982 to complete the work, loans were negotiated with the Bristol & West and Lombard North Central with guarantees from local councils. The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", featuring a cast from the National Theatre led by Paul Scofield. The event was attended by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon.\n\nIn October 2009, the '2010 Refurbishment Appeal' was launched by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Royal Patron of the Theatre Royal Bath, to raise money for a programme of work to preserve the 200-year-old building, while ensuring that it remained suitable for 21st-century audiences.\nThe £3million refurbishment by Fry, the most extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars and the creation of The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work.\n\nA successful campaign, led by writer and novelist Bel Mooney, who had been instrumental in previous fund-raising campaigns for the Theatre Royal Bath, saw almost a third of the money raised through donations and sponsorship, enabling work to begin away from public areas in March 2010. The theatre's Main House was closed in July 2010, to allow the work on the foyer, bars and auditorium to be completed.\n\nThe official re-opening took place on Wednesday, 8 September 2010, just ten and a half months after the original campaign was launched, with the building work being completed on schedule. The ceremonial re-opening was performed on-stage by actors Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, who were starring in the Theatre Royal's own production of \"The Rivals\", Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration comedy, set in and around 18th-century Bath. In 2011, the theatre won a British Construction Industry Award Conservation Award.\n\nThe theatre itself is said to be haunted by several ghosts including the Grey Lady, who was an actress centuries ago. She has been seen watching productions in the Grey Lady Box, and she leaves the distinctive scent of jasmine. She has purportedly been seen and scented in recent years.\n\nThe theatre, along with the neighbouring Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered a prime example of Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above the door is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900 seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars.\n\nIn 2017 the Sawclose area between the current Theatre Royal main entrance and the former Bluecoat School is to be made into a pedestrian-friendly shared space area for pedestrians, cyclists and cars.\n\nIn 1997, a studio theatre was built at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled \"Hopefully\". The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of \"Breakfast With Mugabe\", starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey.\n\nAs of 2015, the studio is led by the Artistic Director Laurence Boswell. In the 2012 American Season at the Ustinov Studio, Sarah Ruhl's \"In the Next Room\" (or \"The Vibrator Play\") was the winner of the Best New Play — Theatre Awards UK 2012 and nominated for three Tony Awards. The Ustinov Studio was also nominated for the prestigious Empty Space ... Peter Brook Award 2012. \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s Dominic Cavendish praised the venue as a \"constantly bubbling fount of marvels\" at the awards ceremony. The Ustinov also received a second consecutive nomination for the 2013 awards.\n\nIn Autumn 2013, the Ustinov presented \"The Spanish Golden Age Season\", three new translations of rarely seen plays. These included the tragedy \"Punishment without Revenge\", and the romantic comedies \"Don Gil of the Green Breeches\" and \"A Lady of Little Sense\", which ran in repertory with a cast of ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013. It was later transferred to the Arcola Theatre.\n\nIn Summer 2014, the Ustinov Studio presented a new comedy, 'Bad Jews', and in November of the same year, a black comedy by Florian Zeller, 'The Father' starring Kenneth Cranham. Both of these plays have gone on to huge national and international success in following two years, running almost continuously on several tours and West End transfers, culminating in Kenneth Cranham winning the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Play at the 2016 Awards Ceremony.\n\nIn 2005 another new theatre was opened behind the Theatre Royal, The Egg, which provides professional theatre productions for children and their families, alongside workshops and youth theatre productions. It includes a cafe, which is also the venue for children's and family events, and occasional teenage arts events.\n\nThe theatre's Vaults Restaurant provides pre-show dinners and matinée lunches, and a suite of rooms (\"The 1805 Rooms\") are available for functions. The Theatre Royal is also licensed to host weddings and civil partnership ceremonies.\n\nAlongside the weekly touring productions which make up most of its programme, the Theatre Royal is host to several annual events, including the Family Theatre Festival and the Shakespeare Unplugged Festival. The Peter Hall Company Season was held from 2003 until 2011. Many plays start at the Theatre Royal before their official opening in London.\n\n\n"}

In 1984, alleged telekinesis events at her Columbus, Ohio home drew significant news media interest. A series of color photographs taken by photojournalist Fred Shannon, and published by \"The Columbus Dispatch\", were purported to show Resch sitting in an armchair with a telephone handset and phone cord flying in front of her, from left to right. Resch's story, and Shannon's photography, were featured on a 1993 episode of \"Unsolved Mysteries\".\n\nSkeptics and debunkers pointed out that much of the proclaimed evidence was anecdotal and thin and declared the case to be a hoax. Paul Kurtz wrote that Resch was \"a disturbed teenager\" who faked poltergeist phenomena because she \"craved attention\".\n\nResch was married and divorced twice, and had a child named Amber Boyer. In 1994, facing a potential death penalty if she agreed to go to trial before jury, Resch instead accepted a plea bargain with prosecutors to being responsible for the death of her three-year-old daughter that had occurred while the daughter was being looked after by her boyfriend, and she was sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nTina Resch is the adopted daughter of Joan and John Resch. The Resches were well known in Columbus, as they were foster parents who had helped care for 250 children prior to 1984. When she was 14, Tina watched the movie \"Poltergeist\", and shortly afterward the family reported seeing objects fly around their house. Reporter Mike Harden of \"The Columbus Dispatch\" was asked to assist the family, and involved photographer Fred Shannon. \"The Columbus Dispatch\" interviewed Tina, and later published several photos purporting to show a telephone flying through the air.\n\nParapsychologist William Roll stayed in the Resch house to investigate the case, and claimed that there had been genuine \"spontaneous psychokinesis\". Roll, however, never observed any object move by itself. In one incident, a picture fell from a wall in an upstairs room where Tina had been alone half an hour before; Roll was facing away from the picture when it fell. James Randi, an investigator for the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal was refused access to the household, but investigated the case and suspected Tina had faked the alleged poltergeist occurrences. According to Terence Hines:\n\nThe Resch poltergeist turned out to be so elusive that no one ever actually saw a single object even start to move of its own accord. This included the newspaper photographer, who found that if he watched an object, it stubbornly refused to budge. So he would hold up his camera and look away... One of the photos obtained in this way was distributed by the Associated Press and touted widely as proof of the reality of the phenomenon. Examined closely, the photographic evidence in this case strongly suggested that Tina was faking the occurrences by simply throwing the phone and other \"flying\" objects when no one was looking. Randi's careful analysis of the other photos, many unpublished, of Tina and her flying phone strengthen the conclusion that she was faking. The editor of \"The Columbus Dispatch\", Luke Feck, embarrassed by the revelation that he and his paper were taken in by so obvious a fake, refused Randi permission to print the photos he had given him earlier, in an apparent attempt to suppress the evidence of Tina's trickery and the newspaper's credulity.\"\n\nIn a later incident, a visiting television crew inadvertently left a video camera on, which caught footage of Tina deliberately knocking over a table lamp, then screaming as if in fright, an event that had previously been ascribed to the poltergeist. When confronted with the videotape, Tina claimed she had done it to get the reporters to leave. Randi characterized the situation as a hoax by an adolescent girl seeking attention, saying, \"examination of available material indicates that fraudulent means or perfectly explainable methods have been employed to provide the media with sensational details about an otherwise trivial matter.\" Randi examined a roll of photos taken by press photographers and said that they showed the girl's foot hooked beneath a sofa that had purportedly moved by itself, and that the glass in a picture frame that allegedly shattered on its own while in her hands was already broken before she ever picked it up. His conclusion of the case, as he reported in \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Spring 1985, was as follows:\n\nThe evidence for the validity of poltergeist claims in this case is anecdotal and thin, at best. The evidence against them is, in my estimation, strong and convincing.\n\nTina Resch married and divorced twice, changing her name to Christina Boyer, and had a three-year-old daughter named Amber. In April 1992, Amber was found dead, suspected to have been beaten to death. Boyer and David Herrin, her boyfriend of a few months, were arrested and tried for the murder of Amber. Tina was not present at the time of the death of her daughter, who had been left in Herrin's care at the time. The medical examiner at Herrin's trial testified that the cause of Amber's death was \"blunt force trauma she received to her head\", inflicted shortly before her death, and both Tina and Herrin blamed each other for the injuries. Even as the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment about Tina premiered on May 19, 1993, Boyer was in jail and awaiting trial. At the time, the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment made no mention of the criminal charges against Tina.\n\nTina was charged with aggravated battery, and in October 1994, rather than face trial and the possibility of a death sentence, Boyer agreed to a plea bargain negotiated by her attorney and District Attorney Peter Skandalakis. She entered an Alford plea, in which she pleaded guilty while maintaining her innocence. Tina received a life sentence plus 20 years, with the possibility of parole. David Herrin was convicted of cruelty to children, and sentenced to 20 years. He was released from Dooly State Prison on November 16, 2011.\n\nThe \"Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" referred to Boyer as the \"Telekinetic Mom\" in some of its reporting on the legal issues in 1994.\n\nIn 2004, William Roll collaborated with writer Valerie Storey on a book entitled \"Unleashed – Of Poltergeists and Murder: The Curious Story of Tina Resch\". The book claims Tina possessed telekinetic powers and was innocent in the death of Amber.\n\nSince 2008, Boyer has been incarcerated at Pulaski State Prison in Hawkinsville, Georgia. As of July 2017, the \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segment about her had not been made available for streaming via Amazon Video even though numerous other \"Unsolved Mysteries\" segments had.\n\n"}

In 481 he rebelled against the Sasanian Empire that controlled the eastern part of Armenia known as Persian Armenia. He was appointed as \"marzban\" (governor) of Persian Armenia in 485 and remained in that post until his death around 503-510.\n\nSince 387, the kingdom of Armenia was divided into two zones of influence, Byzantine Armenia and Persian Armenia. In addition, in 428, the last Arsacid monarch, Artaxias IV, was deposed by his overlord Bahram V at the request of the Armenian \"nakharars\", thus starting the Marzpanate period in Persian Armenia. Very quickly, the Armenians were disillusioned: in 449, Yazdegerd II ordered the nobility to convert to Zoroastrianism. The Armenians revolted under the leadership of Vardan Mamikonian, but were defeated on 2 June 451 (or May 26) at the battle of Avarayr; most \"nakharars\" who participated in the revolt were deported to Ctesiphon.\n\nVahan was born around 440 - 445. He was the eldest son of Hmayeak Mamikonian and Dzoyk, he had 3 younger siblings named Vard, Vasak, and Artaxias. His father was killed by guerrillas at Tayk in the aftermath of the battle of Avarayr. Vahan, along with Vasak and Artaxias, was captured by the \"marzban\" of Armenia and was deported to Ctesiphon; sentenced to apostasy, and was \"weakened in their faith,\" according to his childhood friend and contemporary historian Ghazar Parpetsi.\n\nThe three brothers were sentenced to death, however, were released with the help of Mihranid prince Arshusha II. Vahan then regained his possessions, however, he was accused of misappropriation of income of gold mines, and had to pay a large sum of money to the Sasanians.\n\nIn the aftermath of battle of Avarayr, the Armenians were constantly ordered by the Sasanians to go to distant military expeditions, mostly in Eastern Persia. They were also required to accept the growing power of the apostasy, which resulted in the revolt of Vakhtang I of Iberia (r. 447/449 - 502/522), and was positively received by the Armenians. Vahan hesitated to join the rebellion in 481, making Adhur Gushnasp, the \"marzban\" of Armenia, abandon Dvin and take refugee in Artashat.\n\nVahan then asked the other rebels to take an oath on the cross of the Gospel to remain faithful to the covenant he would proclaim as the new \"marzban\" of Armenia, and proclaimed Sahak II Bagratuni as the new \"marzban\". However, Adhur Gushnasp returned from refugee with a force of 7000 horsemen against the insurgents, he was, however, defeated and killed by Vahan and his army at the battle at Akori (northern slope of Ararat), Vahan hitherto remained in Dvin to protect the capital, in early 483, Sasanian reinforcements came, however, Vahan managed to defeat them at the battle of Nersehapat in Artaz (region of Maku.)\n\nVahan then received a letter from Vakhtang, who was with his troops near the Kura river searching after the Sasanian army under Shapur Mihran. Crazed by the lack of promised reinforcements, the Armenians were defeated in 483 at the battle of Akesga that among other consequences, caused the death of Isaac and Vasak Mamikonian Bagratuni II. Vahan then went to Tao while Shapur Mihran was returning to Ctesiphon, allowing the Armenians regain control of the Arax river during winter. In the spring of 484, Shapur Mihran returned as the head of a new army and forced Vahan to flee to refuge near the Byzantine frontier, at Tao and Taron.\n\nHowever, an unexpected event changed the course of events: the death of the Sasanian king Peroz I in 484 in war against the Hephthalites, causing the withdrawal of the Persians in Armenia and recovery of Dvin and Vagharshapat. Struggling to suppress the revolt of his brother Zarir, Peroz's successor, Balash (r. 484-488), needed the help of the Armenians: in exchange for military support, he agreed to sign the Nvarsak Treaty, which granted religious freedom to the Christians and the prohibition of Zoroastrianism in Armenia, including much greater autonomy for the \"nakharar\". Vahan was also recognized as \"sparapet\" and the property of the Mamikonian family and its allies were returned.\n\nDuring the same period, Vahan was appointed as \"marzban\" in 485, and appointed his brother Vard as \"sparapet\". According to John I Mandacuni and Babgeno, Christianity flourished during his reign; churches were restored, and the church of St. Gregory was enlarged. The Cathedral Vagharshapat was also rebuilt. The country enjoyed relative peace, despite the failed attempt of the successor Balash, Kavadh I (r. 488-496, 499-531), to impose on the propositions Nevarsak. In 489, Vahan along with Vachagan III, King of Albania, repelled an Hephthalite invasion of Transcaucasia. Vahan later died between 503 and 510 and was succeeded by his brother Vard Mamikonian. According to Cyril Toumanoff, Vahan Mamikonian hypothetically would have been the father of Artavasdes, the father of Samuel I, who was a \"sparapet\" in 555.\n\n\n \n"}

Crook (October 15, 1839 – March 13, 1915) was one of President Abraham Lincoln's bodyguards in 1865. After Lincoln's assassination (while Crook was off duty), he continued to work in the White House for a total of over 50 years, serving 12 presidents.\n\nEven during the height of the American Civil War, presidential security was lax. Throngs of people entered the White House every day. \"The entrance doors and all the doors on the Pennsylvania side of the mansion were open at all hours of the day and, often, very late into the evening.\" Lincoln finally gave in to concerns for his safety in November 1864, and was assigned four around-the-clock bodyguards. When one was reassigned as the White House doorkeeper, Crook, then a member of the Washington Police Force and a former Union Army soldier, was selected as his replacement, beginning January 4, 1865. Lincoln's son Tad had a speech impediment and referred to Crook as \"Took\". When Crook was later drafted, he went to see the President, who arranged to keep his services.\n\nOn April 14, 1865, Crook began his shift at 8 a.m. He was to have been relieved by John Frederick Parker at 4 p.m., but Parker was several hours late. Lincoln had told Crook that he had been having dreams of himself being assassinated for three straight nights. Crook tried to persuade the President not to attend a performance of the play \"Our American Cousin\" at Ford's Theater that night, or at least allow him to go along as an extra bodyguard, but Lincoln said he had promised his wife they would go. As Lincoln left for the theater, he turned to Crook and said \"Goodbye, Crook.\" Before, Lincoln had always said, \"Good night, Crook.\" Crook later recalled: \"It was the first time that he neglected to say ‘Good Night’ to me and it was the only time that he ever said ‘Good-bye’. I thought of it at that moment and, a few hours later, when the news flashed over Washington that he had been shot, his last words were so burned into my being that they can never be forgotten.\" Crook blamed Parker, who had left his post at the theater without permission.\n\nCrook also served as a bodyguard for Lincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson. It was he who brought the news to the embattled President that he had been acquitted in his impeachment trial in May 1868.\n\nWhen good friend Ulysses S. Grant became President, he appointed Crook \"Executive Clerk of the President of the United States\" in 1870, and dispersing agent in 1877, the latter the position he would hold for the rest of his career. On January 5, 1915, President Woodrow Wilson and the members of the White House staff celebrated his 50 years of service and presented him with a cane.\nCrook set his memoirs down on paper in the book \"Through Five Administrations: Reminiscences of Colonel William H. Crook, Body-Guard to President Lincoln\", compiled and edited by Margarita Spalding Gerry. There are actually six covered, from Lincoln to Chester A. Arthur, though James A. Garfield and Arthur are dealt with in a single chapter.\n\nWilliam H. Crook died at his boarding house after being sick with pneumonia for more than a week. He was predeceased by his wife, Jane Catherine Rodbird (1846-1895). He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery; President Wilson attended the funeral.\n\n"}

From 1992 to 2010, there were 13,827 reported workplace homicide victims, averaging over 700 victims per year, in the United States. Examination of the 2011 data shows that while a majority of workplace fatalities occurred to males, workplace violence disproportionately affects females. Homicides contributed to 21% of all occupational fatalities for women, compared to 9% for men. Of these homicides, relatives or domestic partners contributed to 39% of female homicide cases; male homicide cases were most likely to be perpetrated by robbers, contributing to 36% of male homicide cases.\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") a department of the United States Department of Labor defines workplace violence as \"any act or threat of physical violence, harassment, intimidation, or other threatening disruptive behavior that occurs at the work site.

From 1993 to 1999, an average of about 1.7 million people reported occupational violence. About 75% of these cases are considered simple assault, while 19% of cases are considered aggravated assault.\n\nWorkplace violence is at epidemic proportions. \"There used to be a time when an employee shooting someone in the workplace would be a shock. Now it’s becoming common.” states Kathleen M. Bonczyk, Esq. a researcher and expert on workplace violence prevention.\nFollowing a June 2017 shooting spree when a former employee returned to his Orlando, Florida workplace to murder five co-workers before committing suicide Kathleen M. Bonczyk, Esq. stated “You hear it again and again. People always say ‘We didn’t think it (workplace violence) would happen here,’ but it can happen anywhere and anytime. It shouldn’t be a question of if; employers should operate under the question of when.” \n\n\n\nDr. Arnold H. Buss, of the University of Texas at Austin (1961), identified eight types of workplace aggression:\n\nIn a study performed by Baron and Neuman, researchers found pay cuts and pay freezes, use of part-time employees, change in management, increased diversity, computer monitoring of employee performance, reengineering, and budget cuts were all significantly linked to increased workplace aggression. The study also showed a substantial amount of evidence linking unpleasant physical conditions (high temperature, poor lighting) and high negative affect, which facilitates workplace aggression. Individuals who resort to mass shootings at work often threaten to kill before any actual violence takes place. \n\nIn the United Kingdom there is a legal obligation to complete risk assessments for both physical and psychosocial workplace hazards. Other countries have similar occupational health and safety legislation in place relating to identifying and either eliminating or controlling for hazards in the workplace. Workplace violence is considered to be a significant hazard in its own right. Regulation 3 of the \"Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations\" 1999 states that, “every employer shall make a suitable and sufficient assessment of:\n\nThe Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety lists the following higher risk occupations.\n\nHealth care workers are at high risk for experiencing violence in the workplace. Examples of violence include threats, physical assaults, and muggings. According to estimates of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the rate of nonfatal occupational injuries and illnesses involving days away from work was 15.1 per 10,000 full-time workers in 2012. This rate is much higher than the rate for total private industries, which is 4.0 per 10,000 full-time workers.\n\nMonitoring workplace violence trends is essential to identifying targeted prevention strategies. The Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN) is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities. NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.\n\n\n"}
