The election was held to fill the seat vacated by Senator Thad Cochran when he resigned from the Senate, effective April 1, 2018, due to health concerns. Republican Governor Phil Bryant appointed Cindy Hyde-Smith to fill the vacancy created by Cochran's resignation. Hyde-Smith sought election to serve the balance of Cochran's term, which expires in January 2021.\n\nOn November 6, per Mississippi law, a nonpartisan top-two special general election took place on the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat currently held by Roger Wicker. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot.\n\nBecause no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff between the top two candidates, Cindy Hyde-Smith and Mike Espy, was held on November 27, 2018, in which Hyde-Smith defeated Espy. Despite her reasonable margin of victory, Hyde-Smith significantly under-performed the states's partisan lean, as well as the 20-point margin of victory of Roger Wicker in his senatorial election, held concurrently with the first round of the special election in which the combined GOP candidates won 58% to the combined Dem total of 42%. Espy's 46% of the vote is the best Democratic performance in a Mississippi senate election since the 1988 election.\n\nThe victory makes Hyde-Smith the first woman ever elected to the Senate from Mississippi.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the run-off campaign, while appearing with cattle rancher Colin Hutchinson in Tupelo, Mississippi, Hyde-Smith said, \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be in the front row.\" Hyde-Smith's comment immediately drew harsh criticism, given Mississippi's notorious history of lynchings and public executions of African-Americans. In response to the criticism, Hyde-Smith downplayed her comment as \"an exaggerated expression of regard\" and characterized the backlash as \"ridiculous.\"\n\nHyde-Smith joined Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant at a news conference in Jackson, Mississippi on November 12, 2018, where she was asked repeatedly about her comment by reporters. In the footage, Hyde-Smith adamantly refused to provide any substantive answer to reporters' questions, responding on five occasions with variations of, \"I put out a statement yesterday, and that's all I'm gonna say about it.\" When reporters redirected questions to Bryant, he defended Hyde-Smith's comment, and changed the subject to abortion, saying he was \"confused about where the outrage is at about 20 million African American children that have been aborted.\"\n\nOn November 15, 2018, Hyde-Smith appeared in a video clip saying that it would be \"a great idea\" to make it more difficult for liberals to vote. Her campaign stated that Hyde-Smith was making an obvious joke, and the video was selectively edited. Both this and the \"public hanging\" video were released by Lamar White Jr., a Louisiana blogger and journalist.\n^Highest rating given\n\nHyde-Smith defeated Espy in the runoff election on November 27, 2018. She received 54% of the vote compared to Espy's 46%.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1752228", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1752228", "title": "Boon Island", "text": "Boon Island\n\nBoon Island is a barren piece of land located in the Gulf of Maine 6 miles (10 km) off the town of York on the Maine coast. The island is approximately 300 by 700 feet (90 by 210 m) in size at low tide, and is the site of Boon Island Light, the tallest lighthouse in New England.\n\nIt is often said that the island got its name when the coastal trading vessel, the \"Increase\", wrecked on it in the summer of 1682. Four survivors — three white men and one Indian — spent a month on the island, subsisting on fish and gulls' eggs. One day they saw smoke rising from Mount Agamenticus several miles away in York, so they built a fire to attract attention to their plight. The Indians at Mount Agamenticus saw the smoke from the island and the castaways were soon rescued. Seeing their survival as a boon granted by God, the men are said to have dubbed it Boon Island. It's a good story but in fact John Winthrop mentions in his journal passing by Boon Island by name some eighty years earlier. Celia Thaxter called the ironically named Boon Island \"the forlornest place that can be imagined.\"\n\nMore famous was the shipwreck on December 11, 1710, of the British merchant ship, \"Nottingham Galley\". All fourteen crewmen aboard survived the initial wreck, however two died from their injuries - the cook, who died a few days after the initial wreck, and a carpenter, who died two weeks after - and another two drowned attempting to reach the mainland on an improvised raft. The remaining ten crewmen managed to stay alive despite winter conditions with no food and no fire for twenty-four days, until finally rescued. They resorted to cannibalism, eating the Carpenter after his death, which gave the incident a notoriety that it retains even today.\n\nThe story also features a conflict between the captain and members of his crew, primarily his first mate, Christopher Langman. Langman, backed by two of his fellow crew mates, claimed that that Dean turned the ship over to French privateers and then planned to wreck the ship for insurance money. When his crew learned of this, they mutinied and forced Dean to continue to Boston, resulting in its wreck on Boon Island. The crew also claimed that A vigorous public relations battle ensued in London the following summer between the captain and members of his unhappy crew, which also helped make the story famous in its day. The harrowing story was fictionalized by Kenneth Roberts in his 1956 novel \"Boon Island\". The only non-fiction history of the event, \"Boon Island: A True Story of Mutiny, Shipwreck and Cannibalism,\" by Andrew Vietze and Stephen Erickson, appeared in 2012. It is said that after the \"Nottingham Galley \" disaster, local fishermen began leaving barrels of provisions on Boon Island in case of future wrecks.\n\nA wooden day beacon was erected in 1799 but lasted only five years. Fierce storms repeatedly scour Boon Island, which has an elevation of above sea level at its highest point. Violent seas can heave boulders across its surface, demolishing structures. A stone day beacon was constructed. In 1811, a stone lighthouse was built which stood 32 feet above the water, then rebuilt in 1831 to stand 49 feet. But damage from the elements was relentless. Consequently, in 1854–1855 the tallest lighthouse in New England was built — 133 feet (40 m) of massive granite blocks at a cost of US$25,000. It had a focal plane of 137 feet (42 m). Keepers willing to live in such a desolate place were few, arriving and departing in steady succession. Only one man seemed to thrive there; William W. Williams stayed 27 years and lived past the age of 90.\n\nIn February 1944, the \"Empire Knight\", a 428-foot (130 m) British freight ship, ran aground at Boon Island and later broke into two sections. The stern section, which included the ship's cargo holds, sank in approximately 260 feet (80 m) of water, one and one half miles (2–3 km) from the Island. In August 1990, the United States Coast Guard became aware of the existence of a plan of stowage dating from 1944 for the ship indicating that 221 flasks (7,620 kg) of mercury may have been loaded onto the vessel. Investigation revealed that such flasks had been placed on the ship but had since deteriorated, releasing the mercury. An estimated 16,000 pounds (7¼ t) of mercury remain unrecovered and it is believed to have settled in the low point of the cargo hold.\n\nIn 1978, two lightkeepers on the island had to retreat from a powerful winter storm. They took shelter in the light chamber while the seas and wind demolished all other structures on the island. Water rose five feet up the tower and dislodged a number of its segments. Next day, they were rescued by helicopter. The tower was repaired and automated, no longer requiring a resident keeper. It is now powered by solar power.\n\nIn May 2000, the U.S. Coast Guard leased Boon Island Lighthouse to the American Lighthouse Foundation (ALF) for the restoration and preservation of the historic isolated sea sentinel.\n\nIn an effort to raise funds to restore and maintain the remote lighthouse, a fictional lighthouse nation declared its independence as The Republic of Boon Island on April 1, 2003.\n\nIn 2014 the lighthouse was sold to real estate developer Art Girard. It has since been sold several more times, and is currently own by Boon Island LLC.\n\n\n\n"}

The name derives from Greek \"kalos\" (beautiful) and \"melos\" (black) because it turns black on reaction with ammonia. This was known to alchemists.\n\nCalomel occurs as a secondary mineral which forms as an alteration product in mercury deposits. It occurs with native mercury, amalgam, cinnabar, mercurian tetrahedrite, eglestonite, terlinguaite, montroydite, kleinite, moschelite, kadyrelite, kuzminite, chursinite, kelyanite, calcite, limonite and various clay minerals. \n\nThe type locality is Moschellandsburg, Alsenz-Obermoschel, Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany.\n\nCalomel is used as the interface between metallic mercury and a chloride solution in a saturated calomel electrode, which is used in electrochemistry to measure pH and electrical potentials in solutions, In most electrochemical measurements, it is necessary to keep one of the electrodes in an electrochemical cell at a constant potential. This so-called reference electrode allows control of the potential of a working electrode.\n\nCalomel was a widespread and popular medicine for administration to infants as a purgative to treat intestinal worms and \"clear out noxious matter\" but was used indiscriminately for a great number of ailments. It is tasteless and, mixed with a sweetener, was readily taken. Fumigation tents to supply calomel, heated on a metal plate, as a sublimate within children's lungs were a later method of delivery. As the mercury it contained had the effect of softening the gums, it was made the principle constituent of teething powders, until the mid-twentieth century. \n\nThe compound is a laxative and once was a common medicine, especially on the American frontier. It fell out of use at the end of the 19th century due to its toxicity. One victim was Alvin Smith, the eldest brother of Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n"}

{"id": "297024", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297024", "title": "Cascading failure", "text": "Cascading failure\n\nA cascading failure is a process in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts can trigger the failure of other parts and so on. Such a failure may happen in many types of systems, including power transmission, computer networking, finance, human body systems, and transportation systems.\n\nCascading failures may occur when one part of the system fails. When this happens, other parts must then compensate for the failed component. This in turn overloads these nodes, causing them to fail as well, prompting additional nodes to fail one after another.\n\nCascading failure is common in power grids when one of the elements fails (completely or partially) and shifts its load to nearby elements in the system. Those nearby elements are then pushed beyond their capacity so they become overloaded and shift their load onto other elements. Cascading failure is a common effect seen in high voltage systems, where a single point of failure (SPF) on a fully loaded or slightly overloaded system results in a sudden spike across all nodes of the system. This surge current can induce the already overloaded nodes into failure, setting off more overloads and thereby taking down the entire system in a very short time.\n\nThis failure process cascades through the elements of the system like a ripple on a pond and continues until substantially all of the elements in the system are compromised and/or the system becomes functionally disconnected from the source of its load. For example, under certain conditions a large power grid can collapse after the failure of a single transformer.\n\nMonitoring the operation of a system, in real-time, and judicious disconnection of parts can help stop a cascade. Another common technique is to calculate a safety margin for the system by computer simulation of possible failures, to establish safe operating levels below which none of the calculated scenarios is predicted to cause cascading failure, and to identify the parts of the network which are most likely to cause cascading failures.\n\nOne of the primary problems with preventing electrical grid failures is that the speed of the control signal is no faster than the speed of the propagating power overload, i.e. since both the control signal and the electrical power are moving at the same speed, it is not possible to isolate the outage by sending a warning ahead to isolate the element.\n\nThe question if power grid failures are correlated have been studied in Daqing Li et al as well as by Paul DH Hines et al.\n\nCascading failure caused the following power outages:\n\nCascading failures can also occur in computer networks (such as the Internet) in which network traffic is severely impaired or halted to or between larger sections of the network, caused by failing or disconnected hardware or software. In this context, the cascading failure is known by the term cascade failure. A cascade failure can affect large groups of people and systems.\n\nThe cause of a cascade failure is usually the overloading of a single, crucial router or node, which causes the node to go down, even briefly. It can also be caused by taking a node down for maintenance or upgrades. In either case, traffic is routed to or through another (alternative) path. This alternative path, as a result, becomes overloaded, causing it to go down, and so on. It will also affect systems which depend on the node for regular operation.\n\nThe symptoms of a cascade failure include: packet loss and high network latency, not just to single systems, but to whole sections of a network or the internet. The high latency and packet loss is caused by the nodes that fail to operate due to congestion collapse, which causes them to still be present in the network but without much or any useful communication going through them. As a result, routes can still be considered valid, without them actually providing communication.\n\nIf enough routes go down because of a cascade failure, a complete section of the network or internet can become unreachable. Although undesired, this can help speed up the recovery from this failure as connections will time out, and other nodes will give up trying to establish connections to the section(s) that have become cut off, decreasing load on the involved nodes.\n\nA common occurrence during a cascade failure is a walking failure, where sections go down, causing the next section to fail, after which the first section comes back up. This ripple can make several passes through the same sections or connecting nodes before stability is restored.\n\nCascade failures are a relatively recent development, with the massive increase in traffic and the high interconnectivity between systems and networks. The term was first applied in this context in the late 1990s by a Dutch IT professional and has slowly become a relatively common term for this kind of large-scale failure.\n\nNetwork failures typically start when a single network node fails. Initially, the traffic that would normally go through the node is stopped. Systems and users get errors about not being able to reach hosts. Usually, the redundant systems of an ISP respond very quickly, choosing another path through a different backbone. The routing path through this alternative route is longer, with more hops and subsequently going through more systems that normally do not process the amount of traffic suddenly offered.\n\nThis can cause one or more systems along the alternative route to go down, creating similar problems of their own.\n\nAlso, related systems are affected in this case. As an example, DNS resolution might fail and what would normally cause systems to be interconnected, might break connections that are not even directly involved in the actual systems that went down. This, in turn, may cause seemingly unrelated nodes to develop problems, that can cause another cascade failure all on its own.\n\nIn December 2012, a partial loss (40%) of GMail service occurred globally, for 18 minutes. This loss of service was caused by a routine update of load balancing software which contained faulty logic—in this case, the error was caused by logic using an inappropriate \"all\" instead of the more appropriate \"some\". The cascading error was fixed by fully updating a single node in the network instead of partially updating all nodes at one time.\n\nCertain load-bearing structures with discrete structural components can be subject to the \"zipper effect\", where the failure of a single structural member increases the load on adjacent members. In the case of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse, a suspended walkway (which was already overstressed due to an error in construction) failed when a single vertical suspension rod failed, overloading the neighboring rods which failed sequentially (i.e. like a zipper). A bridge that can have such a failure is called fracture critical, and numerous bridge collapses have been caused by the failure of a single part. Properly designed structures use an adequate factor of safety and/or alternate load paths to prevent this type of mechanical cascade failure.\n\nBiochemical cascades exist in biology, where a small reaction can have system-wide implications. One negative example is ischemic cascade, in which a small ischemic attack releases toxins which kill off far more cells than the initial damage, resulting in more toxins being released. Current research is to find a way to block this cascade in stroke patients to minimize the damage.\n\nIn the study of extinction, sometimes the extinction of one species will cause many other extinctions to happen. Such a species is known as a keystone species.\n\nAnother example is the Cockcroft–Walton generator, which can also experience cascade failures wherein one failed diode can result in all the diodes failing in a fraction of a second.\n\nYet another example of this effect in a scientific experiment was the implosion in 2001 of several thousand fragile glass photomultiplier tubes used in the Super-Kamiokande experiment, where the shock wave caused by the failure of a single detector appears to have triggered the implosion of the other detectors in a chain reaction.\n\nIn finance, the risk of cascading failures of financial institutions is referred to as \"systemic risk:\" the failure of one financial institution may cause other financial institutions (its counterparties) to fail, cascading throughout the system.\nInstitutions that are believed to pose systemic risk are deemed either \"too big to fail\" (TBTF) or \"too interconnected to fail\" (TICTF), depending on why they appear to pose a threat.\n\nNote however that systemic risk is not due to individual institutions per se, but due to the interconnections.\n\nA related (though distinct) type of cascading failure in finance occurs in the stock market, exemplified by the 2010 Flash Crash.\n\nDiverse infrastructures such as water supply, transportation, fuel and power stations are coupled together. Owing to this coupling, interdependent networks are extremely sensitive to random failure, and in particular to targeted attacks, such that a failure of a small fraction of nodes from one network can produce an iterative cascade of failures in several interdependent networks. Electrical blackouts frequently result from a cascade of failures between interdependent networks, and the problem has been dramatically exemplified by the several large-scale blackouts that have occurred in recent years. Blackouts are a fascinating demonstration of the important role played by the dependencies between networks. For example, the September 28, 2003 blackout in Italy resulted in a widespread failure of the railway network, health care systems, and financial services and, in addition, severely influenced the communication networks. The partial failure of the communication system in turn further impaired the power grid management system, thus producing a positive feedback on the power grid. This example emphasizes how inter-dependence can significantly magnify the damage in an interacting network system. A framework to study the cascading failures between coupled networks based on percolation theory was developed recently. Cascading failures in spatially embedded systems have been\nshown to lead to extreme vulnerability. For the dynamic process of cascading failures see refs. A model for repairing failures so to avoid cascading failures was developed by Di Muro et al.\n\nFurthermore, it was shown that such systems when embedded in space are extremely vulnerable to localized attacks or failures. Above a critical radius of damage, the failure may spread to the entire system.\n\nA model for cascading failures due to overload propagation is the Motter–Lai model. The tempo-spatial propagation of such failures have been studied by Jichang Zhao et al.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24932989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24932989", "title": "Data analysis techniques for fraud detection", "text": "Data analysis techniques for fraud detection\n\nFraud is a billion-dollar business and it is increasing every year. The PwC global economic crime survey of 2018 found that half (49 percent) of the 7,200 companies they surveyed had experienced fraud of some kind. This is an increase from the PwC 2016 study in which slightly more than a third of organizations surveyed (36%) had experienced economic crime.\n\nFraud possibilities co-evolve with technology, esp. Information technology Business reengineering, reorganization or downsizing may weaken or eliminate control, while new information systems may present additional opportunities to commit fraud.\n\nTraditional methods of data analysis have long been used to detect fraud. They require complex and time-consuming investigations that deal with different domains of knowledge like financial, economics, business practices and law. Fraud often consists of many instances or incidents involving repeated transgressions using the same method. Fraud instances can be similar in content and appearance but usually are not identical.\n\nThe first industries to use data analysis techniques to prevent fraud were the telephone companies, the insurance companies and the banks (Decker 1998). One early example of successful implementation of data analysis techniques in the banking industry is the FICO Falcon fraud assessment system, which is based on a neural network shell.\n\nRetail industries also suffer from fraud at POS. Some supermarkets have started to make use of digitized closed-circuit television (CCTV) together with POS data of most susceptible transactions to fraud.\n\nInternet transactions have recently raised big concerns, with some research showing that internet transaction fraud is 10 times higher than in-store fraud.\n\nFraud that involves cell phones, insurance claims, tax return claims, credit card transactions etc. represent significant problems for governments and businesses, but yet detecting and preventing fraud is not a simple task. Fraud is an adaptive crime, so it needs special methods of intelligent data analysis to detect and prevent it. These methods exist in the areas of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Data Mining, Machine Learning and Statistics. They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of fraud crimes.\n\nTechniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and artificial intelligence. Examples of statistical data analysis techniques are:\n\nSome forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud. The main steps in forensic analytics are (a) data collection, (b) data preparation, (c) data analysis, and (d) reporting. For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use. Forensic analytics might be used to review the invoicing activity for a vendor to identify fictitious vendors, and these techniques might also be used by a franchisor to detect fraudulent or erroneous sales reports by the franchisee in a franchising environment.\n\nFraud management is a knowledge-intensive activity. The main AI techniques used for fraud management include:\n\nOther techniques such as link analysis, Bayesian networks, decision theory, and sequence matching are also used for fraud detection.\n\nThe younger companies in the fraud prevention space tend to rely on systems that have been based around machine learning, rather than later incorporating machine learning into an existing system. These companies include FeaturespaceZensed, Feedzai, Cybersource, Stripe, Fraud.net, SecurionPay, Forter, Sift Science, Signifyd, Riskified, Experian and ThirdWatch. However, multiple security concerns have been raised about how such solutions collect signals for fraud detection and how they are being deployed .\n\nEarly data analysis techniques were oriented toward extracting quantitative and statistical data characteristics. These techniques facilitate useful data interpretations and can help to get better insights into the processes behind the data. Although the traditional data analysis techniques can indirectly lead us to knowledge, it is still created by human analysts.\n\nTo go beyond, a data analysis system has to be equipped with a substantial amount of background knowledge, and be able to perform reasoning tasks involving that knowledge and the data provided. In effort to meet this goal, researchers have turned to ideas from the machine learning field. This is a natural source of ideas, since the machine learning task can be described as turning background knowledge and examples (input) into knowledge (output).\n\nIf data mining results in discovering meaningful patterns, data turns into information. Information or patterns that are novel, valid and potentially useful are not merely information, but knowledge. One speaks of discovering knowledge, before hidden in the huge amount of data, but now revealed.\n\nThe machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions may be classified into two categories: 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning. These methods seek for accounts, customers, suppliers, etc. that behave 'unusually' in order to output suspicion scores, rules or visual anomalies, depending on the method.\n\nWhether supervised or unsupervised methods are used, note that the output gives us only an indication of fraud likelihood. No stand alone statistical analysis can assure that a particular object is a fraudulent one, but they can identify them with very high degrees of accuracy. \n\nIn supervised learning, a random sub-sample of all records is taken and manually classified as either 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent'. Relatively rare events such as fraud may need to be over sampled to get a big enough sample size. These manually classified records are then used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm. After building a model using this training data, the algorithm should be able to classify new records as either fraudulent or non-fraudulent.\n\nSupervised neural networks, fuzzy neural nets, and combinations of neural nets and rules, have been extensively explored and used for detecting fraud in mobile phone networks and financial statement fraud.\n\nBayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud.\n\nHybrid knowledge/statistical-based systems, where expert knowledge is integrated with statistical power, use a series of data mining techniques for the purpose of detecting cellular clone fraud. Specifically, a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behaviour from a large database of customer transactions is implemented.\n\nCahill et al. (2000) design a fraud signature, based on data of fraudulent calls, to detect telecommunications fraud. For scoring a call for fraud its probability under the account signature is compared to its probability under a fraud signature. The fraud signature is updated sequentially, enabling event-driven fraud detection.\n\nLink analysis comprehends a different approach. It relates known fraudsters to other individuals, using record linkage and social network methods.\n\nThis type of detection is only able to detect frauds similar to those which have occurred previously and been classified by a human. To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm.\n\nIn contrast, unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records.\n\nSome important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts.\n\nAlso, Murad and Pinkas focus on behavioural changes for the purpose of fraud detection and present three-level-profiling. Three-level-profiling method operates at the account level and points to any significant deviation from an account's normal behaviour as a potential fraud. In order to do this, 'normal' profiles are created based on data without fraudulent records (semi supervised). In the same field, also Burge and Shawe-Taylor use behaviour profiling for the purpose of fraud detection. However, using a recurrent neural network for prototyping calling behaviour, unsupervised learning is applied.\n\nCox et al. combines human pattern recognition skills with automated data algorithms. In their work, information is presented visually by domain-specific interfaces, combining human pattern recognition skills with automated data algorithms (Jans et al.).\n"}

The Bureau International des Expositions (BIE) general assembly in Paris awarded Dubai as the host on November 27, 2013.\n\nAs a World Expo, it may be a maximum of six months in length and adhere to a wide universal theme that applies to all humanity. Past themes of Universal Expositions include \"Man and His World\" Montreal Expo 67, \"Leisure in the Age of Technology\" Brisbane Expo 88 and \"Discovery\" Seville Expo 92.\n\nThe main site of Expo Dubai 2020 will be a 438-hectare area (1083 acres) located between Dubai and Abu Dhabi cities, near Dubai emirate's western border with Abu Dhabi emirate.\nThe master plan, designed by the American firm HOK, is organized around a central plaza, entitled \"Al Wasl\", enclosed by three large pavilions which will be built by Al-Futtaim Carillion, each one dedicated to a sub-theme.\nDubai has also been emphasizing on investments in various sectors such as economic growth, real estate, environmental avenues and public affairs. In recent times, Dubai has made major investments in Real Estate as well as introduced a world’s largest Solar Power Project which is all set to start by Expo 2020. Apart from pumping money, the nation is also keen on giving equal prominence to public relationships. The initiative – Dubai Happiness Agenda, has 16 programmes under four themes that sums up 82 projects to be set in the city with an aim to make the city the happiest by 2020. The Dubai Expo 2020 also would see a rise in the GDP as predicted by the International Monetary Fund.\n\nThere are reports which have analysed the recent economic downturn and predict that World Expo 2020 Dubai will lead to a property bubble, which might have far reaching consequences. Furthermore, the expo has been very quiet recently and like many other projects in Dubai, some expo projects are cancelled. In other words the hype has died. \n\nThe following nations have announced their participation in Expo 2020:\n\nOnce the first city had lodged a bid with the BIE, other cities had six months to respond. In early 2011, Izmir of Turkey and Ayutthaya of Thailand submitted bids to the BIE, initiating the six-month window for other cities to bid. When this window closed on 2 November 2011, there were five prospective cities, with Dubai making a last minute entry. The BIE voted and selected the host city on 27 November 2013.\n\nFive cities originally bid for the slot for a world's fair in 2020, with four remaining: Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Yekaterinburg, Russia; Izmir, Turkey; or São Paulo, Brazil. Expo 2020 will represent a first as a Middle Eastern destination will be hosting the event for the first time.\n\nThe following cities lodged bids to the BIE for hosting the 2020 EXPO:\nSão Paulo was eliminated from contention after the first round of votes. Izmir was knocked out in the second. Yekaterinburg lost to Dubai in the third and final round of voting.\n\nUAE selected the theme \"Connecting Minds, Creating the Future\", sub-themes being Sustainability, Mobility and Opportunity.\n\n\"In today’s highly interconnected world, a renewed vision of progress and development based on shared purpose and commitment is key. While a married human mind, an individual country, or a specific community is both unique and remarkable, it is by working collaboratively that we truly advance.\" Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum said in support of the bid.\n\nThe World Expo in Dubai in 2020 will be the first to be held in the MENA & SA (Middle East and North Africa & South Asia) region.\nOn 27 November 2013, when Dubai won the right to host the expo 2020, fireworks erupted at the world's tallest building, Burj Khalifa. A national holiday was declared the following day for all educational institutions across the country. The Dubai Ruler promised Dubai would \"astonish the world,\" in 2020. The staging of the world fair and the preparations leading up to it are expected to result in 277,000 new jobs in the UAE, an injection of nearly $40 billion into the economy, and an increase in visitors of at least 25 million and up to 100 million. Director General of Dubai Municipality, Hussain Nasser Lootah, said that they have the largest laboratory in the region, and can easily research new materials and technologies required for construction. The world's tallest commercial tower to be built in Dubai, in Jumeirah Lake Towers, was given the name \"Burj 2020\" in honour of the World Expo 2020.\n\nThe Russian bid \"The Global Mind\" would have run from May 1 to October 31, and would have been the second largest expo (after 2010 in Shanghai) and intended to \"survey world opinion through seven universal questions\".\n\nThe Turkish bid had a theme of \"New Routes to a Better World / Health for All\" and would have run from April 30 to October 31. A \"Health for All\" symnposium was held in October 2013 for BIE delegates and was to discuss health issues across the world.\n\nA Brazilian expo would have been called \"Power of Diversity, Harmony for Growth\", run from May 15 to November 15 and would have covered 502 hectares.\n\n"}

Some cities have all their events during the celebration outside, but some cities have events that are hosted indoors by organizations in the city, such as churches and theaters. Since it happens on New Year's Eve, First Night celebrations are actually held on the last night of the old year. First Night celebrates a community's local culture, often featuring music, dance, comedy, art, fireworks and, in some cities, ice sculptures and parades.\n\nThe first First Night was in Boston on December 31, 1975. It was conceived by Clara Wainwright who organized a small group of artists seeking an alternative way of celebrating New Year's Eve, where Boston’s young, innovative artists and musicians could perform on both indoor and outdoor stages. They also wanted to avoid the emphasis on alcohol that is common at New Year's Eve parties. Soon other surrounding communities started their own First Night celebrations. By the 1990s, the First Night Boston event was attracting works by over a thousand artists. In 2006, more than a million visitors attended First Night events, including free outdoor ice sculptures on Boston Common and in Copley Square, and waterfront fireworks.\n\nLive coverage of the final part of Boston's First Night, including the countdown to midnight and fireworks over Boston Harbor that begin at the stroke of midnight, is broadcast by WBZ-TV. CBS, the station's parent company, is an official sponsor.\n\nIn addition to the New Year's festival, First Night is deeply involved in Boston's art and culture communities via the Neighborhood Network. Started in 1994, the Neighborhood Network partners First Night with 25 community organizations throughout Boston's neighborhoods- including Dorchester, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain and South Boston- to engage young people and families in creative workshops with artists and educators. In 2000 First Night launched Summer Beat, a series of summer camp like dance and music workshops spread around the city of Boston.\n\nIn 2013, the non-profit First Night Boston organization closed for financial reasons, though Mayor Menino of Boston (in office for only another year) pledged to find private or public funding the January 2014 celebration. On November 11, 2013, Mayor Menino announced he had acquired the necessary funding and that the 2013 First Night would be “a bigger, brighter display than ever before.”\n\nThe city of Boston took over the First Night festivities in 2015 and hired an event planning firm to manage the smaller and scaled back event.\n\nBy 1999, First Night celebrations were being held in more than 200 cities. In 2000, more than 260 cities had such a celebration. However, in 2001, 20 cities dropped out of the First Night celebrations due to the effects of the September 11 attacks and/or money difficulties.\n\nDuring the Great Recession, which began in late 2007, many First Night celebrations faced financial difficulty, being scaled back or canceled.\n\nThere are about 45 cities with First Night celebrations happening on New Year's Eve 2013/2014.\n\nThis Google map contains known First Night Celebrations in the United States as of the last edit date on the map.\n\nFirst Night USA is the national offshoot of the original Boston organization. It works with the numerous First Night licensed events throughout the United States.\n\nOther celebrations on New Year's Eve, not labeled \"First Night\", have also sprung up. For example, in 2003, First Night Providence announced they planned to cancel future celebrations, which had been going on for 19 years. A group of local artists created Bright Night Providence, an artist-run New Year's Eve celebration based on the idea and spirit of First Night.\n\n"}

Rather than developing their own car, the series reduced costs substantially by using the Lola B05/52 which was used in the early years of the A1 Grand Prix series. They also continued to use the same 3.4 litre V8 engine built by Zytek Engineering. On 22 December 2014, it was announced that the series would be merged with Auto GP in 2015. This to ensure that at least 18 cars will participate in each race. It was also announced that the 2015 champion will be granted a Formula 1 test. However, the season was halted after two rounds due to the lack of entrants.\n\nAll cars are mechanically identical and have been built with reducing costs in mind, which has led to an approximate price for the whole season of €450,000.

This can be when the maker or drawer of a negotiable instrument, such as a promissory note or check, is induced to sign the instrument without a reasonable opportunity to learn of its fraudulent character or essential terms. Determination of whether an act constitutes fraud in the factum depends upon consideration of \"all relevant factors\". Fraud in the factum usually voids the instrument under state law and is a real defense against even an holder in due course.\n\nContrast this with the situation where a trusted employee signs a check without permission. The employer must still honor the check despite the fact that the check was a fraudulent negotiable instrument. Here, the employer had a reasonable opportunity to avoid the obligation by restricting access to the checks.\n\nFraud in the factum is often contrasted with fraud in the inducement.\n\n\n"}

It is based on the Welsh-based Gorsedd, which was founded by Iolo Morganwg in 1792.\n\nThe Gorsedh Kernow (Gorsedd of Cornwall) was set up in 1928 at Boscawen-Un by Henry Jenner, one of the early proponents of Cornish language revival, who took the name \"Gwas Myghal\", meaning \"servant of Michael\". He and twelve others were initiated by the Archdruid of Wales. It has been held every year since, except during World War II. 1,000 people have been Cornish bards, including Ken George, R. Morton Nance (\"Mordon\") and Peter Berresford Ellis.\n\nAfter 1939 the Council of the Gorsedd of Cornwall approved additional regalia, and asked Francis Cargeeg to design and execute new regalia for the Grand Bard, the Deputy Grand Bard and the Secretary, and two headpieces for the Marshal's staves. Over time, and up to 1970, additional pieces were added, including Plastrons for past Grand Bards, also produced by Francis Cargeeg.\nThe Gorsedh Kernow has now opened up to all forms of revived Cornish language, and states its aim as \"to maintain the national Celtic spirit of Cornwall\". The Gorsedh also encourages the study of the arts and history. It has been held annually since and has become an important institution in Cornwall's cultural and civic life. Its competitions attract many applicants and the \"open Gorsedh\" is attended by many Cornish people. There is also extensive coverage on local media.\n\nAn important part of the open Gorsedh is the awarding of bardships to individuals for meritorious work for Cornish culture. Thus the Gorsedh acts in many ways as a form of \"honours system\". Bardships are awarded for study in the language, services to Cornish music, encouraging the arts (especially amongst children) amongst other things. Initiate Bards are given Bardic names by the Grand Bard who welcomes them into the College of Bards. These names are in Cornish and will often refer somehow to the reason for their bardship: other Bardic names refer to the Bard's personal or family name, or describe the Bards themselves,\n\nThe three major Gorsedhs in Britain are recorded in an ancient Welsh triad as being held at Moel Merw and Bryn Gwyddon in Wales and Boscawen-Un in Cornwall (ref: Craig Weatherhill). After domination of the Brythonic Celts by the Saxons the Bardic tradition fell into disuse and despite attempts at revival over the centuries lost all its prestige.\n\nThe Gorsedh for 2008 was held in September 2008 in Looe which coincided with the Dehwelans Kernow festival. The 2009 Gorsedh began on 18 April at Saltash.\n\n\nMorton Nance became the second Grand Bard in 1934. He said, \"One generation has set Cornish on its feet. It is now for another to make it walk.\" Although the early Gorsedh used the Unified form, in June 2009, members voted overwhelmingly to adopt the new Standard Written Form as their standard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

All of the victims were women who had worked as prostitutes in the Ipswich area. Their bodies were discovered naked, but there were no signs of sexual assault. Two of the victims, Anneli Alderton and Paula Clennell, were confirmed to have been killed by asphyxiation. A cause of death for the other victims, Gemma Adams, Tania Nicol and Annette Nicholls, was not established.\n\nSuffolk Police linked the killings and launched a murder investigation codenamed Operation Sumac. Due to the size of the investigation police officers were drafted from several other police forces. Two arrests were made in connection with the murders. The first suspect, who was never officially named by police, was released without charge. Forklift truck driver Steven Gerald James Wright, then aged 48, was arrested on suspicion of murder on 19 December 2006 and charged with the murders of all five women on 21 December.\n\nWright was remanded in custody and his trial began on 14 January 2008 at Ipswich Crown Court. Wright pleaded not guilty to the charges, although he admitted having sex with all five victims and that he had been patronising prostitutes since the 1980s. DNA and fibre evidence was presented to the court that linked Wright to the victims. He was found guilty of all five murders on 21 February 2008, and was sentenced the following day to life imprisonment, with a recommendation that he should never be released from prison.\n\nThe murders received a large amount of media attention, both nationally and internationally. The press often compared the murders to those committed by the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, who murdered 13 women and attacked seven others (mostly prostitutes) between 1975 and 1981. There was some concern that the level of media coverage at the time could jeopardise a trial. The murders also sparked debates in the media over the laws surrounding prostitution.\n\nThe body of a young woman was discovered in the water of Belstead Brook at Thorpe's Hill, near Hintlesham, by a member of the public on 2 December 2006. The body, later identified as 25-year-old Gemma Adams, had not been sexually assaulted. Six days later, on 8 December, the body of 19-year-old Tania Nicol, a friend of Adams who had been missing since 30 October, was discovered in water at Copdock Mill just outside Ipswich. There was no evidence of sexual assault. On 10 December, a third victim, found by a member of the public in an area of woodland by the A14 road near Nacton, was later identified as 24-year-old Anneli Alderton. According to a police statement, she had been asphyxiated and was about three months pregnant when she died.\n\nIn a press conference police warned all women to stay away from the red light district of Ipswich. On 12 December, Suffolk police announced that the bodies of two more women had been found. On 14 December, the police confirmed one of the bodies as 24-year-old Paula Clennell. Clennell had disappeared on 10 December and was last seen in Ipswich. According to Suffolk Police, Clennell died from \"compression of the throat\". On 15 December, the police confirmed that the other body was that of 29-year-old Annette Nicholls, who disappeared on 5 December. The bodies of Clennell and Nicholls were found in Nacton near the Levington turn-off of the A1156, close to where Alderton was found. A member of the public had seen Clennell's body twenty feet (six metres) from the main road and a police helicopter dispatched to the scene discovered the second body of Nicholls nearby.\nSuffolk police linked the killings and launched a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Sumac. Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance owing to the magnitude of the investigation. A senior investigator with the Metropolitan Police, Commander Dave Johnston, was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from Scotland Yard in London in an advisory capacity. The day-to-day investigation was conducted by Detective Chief Superintendent Stewart Gull.\n\nDuring press conferences on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five bodies were found to have been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, indicating that the victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged to any of the murdered women.\n\nDuring the course of the press briefings, DCS Gull stated that over 300 police officers were involved in the investigation, and some 400–450 calls were being received daily by detectives.\n\nOn 15 December, Suffolk Constabulary's website revealed that a total of 7,300 telephone calls had been made to police regarding the investigation, and that over 300 police staff and specialists were working on the cases, with support from at least 25 other police forces. As of 18 December, the number of officers involved in the investigation had increased to 650 including 350 officers from 40 other police forces who had assisted in the inquiry. The number of calls received regarding the case had also increased to around 10,000.\n\nTania Nicol, aged 19, from Ipswich, disappeared on 30 October. Her body was discovered by police divers on 8 December in a river near Copdock Mill; there was no evidence of sexual assault and a post mortem could not establish a definite cause of death.\n\nNicol attended Chantry High School but had left home at 16 to live in a hostel, working as a prostitute to fund her addiction to heroin and cocaine. She had originally worked in massage parlours, but was asked to leave on suspicion that she was using drugs. Her mother was unaware she was a prostitute, and thought she had been working in a bar or a hairdresser's.\n\nGemma Rose Adams aged 25, born in Kesgrave, was last seen on West End Road in Ipswich, where she had been living; she disappeared on 15 November at about 01.15 (UTC). Her body was found on 2 December, in a river at Hintlesham. The first victim found, she was naked but had not been sexually assaulted.\n\nAdams had been a popular child, and from a middle-class family. As a teenager, she became addicted to heroin.\nShe had been working as a prostitute to finance her drug addiction, which had already led to loss of her job with an insurance firm. Her partner was at the time also a heroin user, and knew she was working as a prostitute, although her family did not.\n\nAnneli Sarah Alderton, aged 24, a mother of one who was also in the early stages of pregnancy, had been living in Colchester, Essex. Alderton disappeared on 3 December and was last seen on the 17.53 train from Harwich to Manningtree. Alderton got off the train at Manningtree at 18.15 before going on to Ipswich on another train, arriving at 18.43. Alderton's body was found on 10 December near Nacton, in woodland in front of Amberfield School.\n\nAlderton had been asphyxiated and was found naked, and was posed in the cruciform position. Her pregnancy was also revealed by the autopsy and her family were first informed of it by police officers.\n\nAlderton moved to Cyprus with her mother in 1992 after her parents separated, and they returned to Ipswich in 1997. Alderton attended Copleston High School and gained good grades in her exams. Alderton had been addicted to drugs since age 16, shortly after her father's death from lung cancer in 1998.\n\nAnnette Nicholls, aged 29, a mother of one from Ipswich, was initially thought to have gone missing on 4 December, but at the trial it was revealed she was last seen in Ipswich town centre on 8 December. Her family reported her missing after they grew concerned at the news of the other murders. Nicholls' body was found on 12 December near Levington, naked but not sexually assaulted, and also posed in the cruciform position; a definite cause of death could not be established, but her breathing had been hampered.\n\nNicholls, the oldest victim, had been a drug addict since the early 2000s, shortly after completing a beautician's course at Suffolk College. Soon afterwards, she had started working as a prostitute to fund her addiction. After moving to a housing association home from her council house, Nicholls asked her mother to look after her son. She was thought to be staying with a man in Ipswich at the time of her death.\n\nPaula Lucille Clennell, aged 24, born in Northumberland and living in Ipswich, disappeared on 10 December in Ipswich at approximately 00.20. Clennell's body was found on 12 December near Levington on the same day as Nicholls'. Clennell was found naked but not sexually assaulted and a post mortem reported that she had been killed by a compression of her throat. Prior to her death, Clennell commented on the then recent murders in an interview with Anglia News, stating that despite them making her \"a bit wary about getting into cars\" she continued to work because \"I need the money.\"\n\nClennell moved to East Anglia ten years before her death, following the breakup of her parents' marriage. Clennell had three children with her partner; all had been taken into care and adopted due to her drug addiction. Clennell herself had spent some of her childhood in a referral unit, and it was shortly after being placed there that she started taking drugs.\n\nOn 18 December 2006, Suffolk Constabulary reported that they had arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of murdering all five women. The man was arrested at 07.20 at a house in Trimley St. Martin near Felixstowe, Suffolk. The detention of the suspect was extended by magistrates by a further period of 24 hours, to the maximum of 96 hours allowed under English law.\n\nOn 19 December, at 05.00, police arrested a second suspect, a 48 year old, at a residence in Ipswich, on suspicion of committing murder. The following day, 20 December, police were granted a 36-hour extension to question the second suspect in detention.\n\nOn 21 December, a joint statement was issued by DCS Gull and Michael Crimp, senior prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service in Suffolk, announcing that the second suspect identified as Steve Wright had been charged with the murder of all five women.\n\nPolice said that the first suspect, who was not officially named, was released on police bail. Bail conditions were cancelled on 6 June 2007 for the first suspect, as no more inquiries concerning the case were planned involving this person.\n\nWright appeared before magistrates in Ipswich on 22 December 2006, and was remanded in custody.\nHis trial began 16 January 2008. A second jury (of nine men and three women) was selected after a member of the first jury could not continue to serve because of ill health.\n\nThe court heard how the bodies of Anneli Alderton and Annette Nicholls were deliberately posed in the cruciform position, with DNA evidence linking Steve Wright to three of the victims and fibre evidence also connecting him to the victims.\n\nThe defence argued that Wright frequented prostitutes and had \"full sex\" with all of the victims except Tania Nichols, whom he picked up with the intention of having sex, but apparently changed his mind and returned her to Ipswich's red light district.\nThis contradicted Wright's earlier statement when stopped by police in the district in the early hours of the morning: he implied he was unaware he was in the red light district and was driving around because he could not sleep. Wright's rented flat was located in the red light area.\n\nJurors were taken to sites involved in the case, including the exterior of Wright's rented house and the sites where the victims were found.\n\nThe prosecutor suggested that Wright may not have acted alone, as the remains of Anneli Alderton were found some distance from the road but with no evidence that her body had been dragged by one person.\n\nIn his summing up, the judge urged the jury to put aside their emotions:\n\nOn 21 February, after eight hours of deliberation, the jury returned unanimous verdicts against Wright on all five counts of murder. A murder conviction carries an automatic term of life imprisonment but the judge could decide if Wright was eligible for parole. The prosecution argued that Wright should receive a whole life tariff and thus never be released from prison. On 22 February Wright was sentenced to life imprisonment, the judge recommending against parole because the murders involved a \"substantial degree of pre-meditation and planning\".\n\nSome family members felt that Wright deserved the death penalty. Craig Bradshaw, brother-in-law of Paula Clenell, said: \"These crimes deserve the ultimate punishment and that can only mean one thing. Where a daughter and the other victims were given no human rights by the monster, his will be guarded by the establishment at great cost to the taxpayers of this country and emotionally to the bereaved families.\"\nBut the father of Gemma Adams said, \"I am very relieved and pleased for all of the families that this is now over and we can now start to get on with our lives.\"\n\nPrime minister Gordon Brown said the case was an example of the importance of the national DNA database.\n\nSteve Gerald James Wright was born in the Norfolk village of Erpingham in April 1958. Wright joined the Merchant Navy after leaving school. In 1978, he married and had a son soon afterwards; the couple later divorced. In 1987 he married another woman; they separated in 1988, and later divorced.\n\nHe worked as a dock worker, a steward on the QE2, a lorry driver, a barman, and, just prior to his arrest, a fork-lift truck driver. He became a father again with another lover in 1992. Wright built up large debts largely through gambling, and had recently been declared bankrupt. Wright had twice tried to commit suicide, firstly by carbon monoxide poisoning and then, in 2000, by an overdose of pills.\n\nWright met his last girlfriend, Pamela Wright (the shared surname is a coincidence), in 2001 in Felixstowe, and they moved to the house in Ipswich together in 2004. Wright had always admitted that he had used prostitutes, firstly whilst in the Merchant Navy, and continuously throughout his life. Investigations into other crimes Wright might have committed continue, including the possibility of an involvement in the Suzy Lamplugh disappearance. However Metropolitan Police have stated that this is not a strong line of enquiry.\n\nThe murders have been likened to those by Peter Sutcliffe, the \"Yorkshire Ripper\" who was convicted of murdering 13 women (and wounding seven others), mainly those who worked as prostitutes, over a period of five years from 1975 to 1980 in northern England;\nand to \"Jack the Ripper\", the infamous Victorian serial murderer who also targeted prostitutes.\n\nAs with previous serial killers dating back to Jack the Ripper, many sections of the media have attempted to coin a name for the presumed murderer, using the \"Suffolk Strangler\", and other terms to refer to the case.\n\nA reward was offered, first by local business Call Connection, who initially offered £25,000 and later raised it to £50,000. Shortly after, the \"News of the World\" offered a £250,000 reward for leads to a direct arrest and conviction of the murderer/murderers, bringing the total reward on offer to £300,000.\n\nOn 21 December 2006, the then Attorney General Lord Goldsmith issued guidance to the media after concerns were raised by Suffolk Constabulary about the coverage and potential prejudice of a future trial. Lord Goldsmith urged the media to show restraint in what they reported about the two suspects being held, for fear of prejudicing any possible trial. A senior prosecutor on the case, Michael Crimp, also expressed his concerns about potentially prejudicial media coverage: \"Steven Wright stands accused of these offences and has a right to a fair trial before a jury. It is extremely important that there should be responsible media reporting which should not prejudice the due process of law.\"\n\nThe murders refocused press attention on a number of controversial issues in British politics.\n\nThe first is that of prostitution in the United Kingdom. The murders have highlighted the vulnerability of prostitutes and the lack of action taken by the government, whether to be more punitive in the hope of reducing the numbers of prostitutes on the streets, to move towards legalised brothels and other measures to improve the safety of the women, or to target the demand for prostitution through prosecution of the clients, as is done in Sweden. The government has moved in the direction of tough \"anti-prostitution\" laws which target the clients.\n\nThe government had at one point considered allowing \"mini brothels\", but abandoned this plan after fears that such establishments would bring pimps and drug dealers into residential areas. Instead, the laws became tougher: the Policing and Crime Act 2009 made it illegal to pay for sex with a prostitute who has been \"subjected to force\" and this is a \"strict liability offense\" (clients can be prosecuted even if they did not know the prostitute was forced).\n\nThe second is that of drug use and whether it should be legalised or decriminalised, provided on prescription to registered addicts, or penalised more harshly. High numbers (95% according to the Home Office) of street prostitutes in the United Kingdom have a history of substance abuse, and prostitution is one means of funding addiction, known to have been used by all five of the victims.\n\nIn March 2008, it was announced that Wright would be lodging an appeal against both his convictions and the trial judge's recommendation of a whole life tariff, claiming (amongst other things) that the trial should not have been held in Ipswich and that the evidence against him constituted insufficient proof of guilt. He was reported to have written to the court of appeal \"All five women were stripped naked of clothing/jewellery/phones/bags and no evidence was found in my house or car.\" He has asked for a new solicitor.\nThis first appeal was rejected in July 2008.\n\nIn July 2008, it was announced that a new appeal would be lodged, but in February 2009 it was reported that Wright had dropped this appeal, though some of his family hoped to persuade the Criminal Cases Review Commission to review the case.\n\nIn December 2012, Wright announced that he would be launching a third appeal.\n\nThe BBC Drama department commissioned a dramatisation of the murders and the investigation from screenwriter Stephen Butchard. The three-part production, entitled \"Five Daughters\", began filming in November 2009, and was broadcast on BBC One from 25–27 April 2010. Only a few days after the BBC's announcement of the drama, Brian Clennell, the father of Paula Clennell, complained that it would portray the victims in \"a bad light\". Wright's brother David also complained that it would jeopardise any future retrial. Sarah Lancashire and Ian Hart led the cast.\n\nA musical play, \"London Road\", commissioned by the Royal National Theatre and written by Alecky Blythe and Adam Cork, is based on interviews with residents of the street in Ipswich where Steve Wright lived. A film adaptation of the play was released in the United Kingdom in 2015. The case was featured in an episode of the documentary series \"Real Crime\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57865498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57865498", "title": "Irish border question", "text": "Irish border question\n\nThe Irish border question is a controversy about the impact that the UK's withdrawal from the European Union will have on the Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border on the island of Ireland, in particular the impact it may have on the economy and people of the island were customs or immigration checks to be put in place at the border. It was prioritised as one of the three most important areas to resolve in order to reach a Withdrawal Agreement. \n\nThe UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June 2016 which would effectively make the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border an external EU border. All parties have stated that they want to avoid a hard border in Ireland particularly due to the sensitive nature of the border. \n\nIn 1922, the Irish Free State seceded from the United Kingdom while Northern Ireland remained in the UK. Consequently the dividing line between these two parts of the island became an international border. Trade in goods and services across this frontier became subject to differing tax and tariff arrangements and an infrastructure of Customs posts was put in place at designated crossing areas. All traffic was subject to inspection by the jurisdiction it was entering. This could entail full vehicle searches with consequent delay and inconvenience. However passport checks were not applied because the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were part of the Common Travel Area.\n\nA number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements made goods checks less intrusive, the completion of the European Single Market in 1992 meant that checks on goods were phased out. However, during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, there were British military checkpoints on main border crossings and UK security forces made some, although not all, of the remaining crossings impassable. In 2005, in phase with implementation of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement , the last of the border checkpoints was removed.\n\n, the UK and the Republic of Ireland are both members of the European Union, and therefore both are in the Customs Union and the Single Market, and will remain so until March 2019. There is freedom of movement for all EU nationals within the Common Travel Area between the UK and Northern Ireland and there are no customs or fixed immigration controls at the border.\n\nSince about 2005 the border has been perceived as being invisible with little or no physical infrastructure, due to processes put in place by the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The Belfast Agreement, signed on the Christian holiday of 'Good Friday' (April 10th, 1998), has the status of both an international treaty between the UK and the Republic of Ireland (British-Irish Agreement) as well as an agreement of the parties within Northern Ireland (Multi-Party Agreement). \n\nFollowing Brexit, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will become an external EU border. It is theorised that a \"hard\" border may return, with both fewer and supervised, crossing posts in order to support the necessary customs-infrastructure.. Both the EU and the UK negotiating-teams have expressed a sentiment that this ought to be avoided, where possible, in the outcome of the treaty-negotiations around the UK's exiting the European Union.\n\nGeorge Mitchell, a foreign political persona associated with the Belfast Agreement, has commented that he believes the creation of a border-control system between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, in the United Kingdom, 'could' jeopardise the Belfast Agreement.\n\nThe UK government have said that Brexit will not mean a return of the hard border. \nAccording to statements by Theresa May and Enda Kenny, it is intended to maintain this arrangement after the United Kingdom leaves the EU.\n\nIn September 2016 the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, David Davis, stated that the UK government would not seek a return to a \"hard border\" between the UK and Republic of Ireland.\n\nA joint plan to allow UK immigration-controls to be applied at Republic of Ireland ports and airports was abandoned in March 2017 after meeting opposition from political parties in the Republic of Ireland\n\nIn its white paper on Brexit, the United Kingdom government reiterated its commitment to the Belfast Agreement. With regard to Northern Ireland's status, it said that the UK Government's \"clearly-stated preference is to retain Northern Ireland's current constitutional position: as part of the UK, but with strong links to Ireland\".\n\nThere have been worries among unionists that the Irish government's position is a covert attempt to gain more power over the province in order to eventually unite Northern Ireland with the Republic, a position the Irish government has denied. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposes a hard Irish border, and wishes to maintain the Common Travel Area.\n\nA referendum on the reunification of Ireland was suggested by NI Sinn Féin leader Martin McGuinness immediately after the UK EU referendum results were announced, a stance reiterated by the new leader Mary Lou McDonald.\n\nA week after the referendum the then First Minister of Northern Ireland, the DUP's Arlene Foster and the Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness issued a joint letter where they said that the border must not become a catalyst for illegal activity or create an incentive for those who wish to undermine the peace process.\n\nIn April 2017 the European Council agreed that, in the event of Irish reunification, Northern Ireland could rejoin the EU.\n\nJoachim Pfeiffer, an influential MP for the governing German CDU party, believes border controls and customs checkpoints could be avoided, if United Kingdom were to perform some major concession such as to accept the four basic freedoms or to find a special solution for Northern Ireland, but that Ireland would have the \"hardest border\" in the event of a No deal Brexit.\n\nIn the withdrawal negotiations the Irish border has been set as one of the three most important areas to resolve before moving to negotiations on the future economic relationship, along with British financial contributions to the EU and the rights of EU citizens in the UK.\n\nThe Irish and UK governments, as well as EU representatives, have stated that they do not wish for a hard border in Ireland, taking into account the historical and social \"sensitivities\" that permeate the island. \n\nMichel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, has indicated that he would look to the United Kingdom and Ireland for \"solutions\" to threats posed to Ireland's trading links, the common travel area, and the Good Friday Agreement. Denying UK media reports that Ireland expects the effective border to become the Irish Sea, Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that \"the onus was on British officials to come up with an imaginative solution but [the Irish Government] would not support a proposal which would see a hard border return on Ireland\".\n\nIn order to keep a friction-less border, the European Union proposed a \"backstop agreement\" within the Withdrawal Agreement called the Northern Ireland Protocol. This would only come into force if there were no other solutions at the time, and it aimed to bring Northern Ireland under a range of EU rules in order to forestall the need for border checks. Although the British government agreed with the principle of such a backstop at the December 2017 meeting, it rejected the legal text prepared by Barnier's office because it created a legal and regulatory barrier between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The British side hoped to achieve an agreement that applies equally to Great Britain as well as Northern Ireland, thus avoiding any need for Northern Ireland to be treated differently. \n\nIn the draft UK/EU Agreement released on 14 November 2018, it is proposed that (from the end of the transition phase on 31 December 2020), the UK and the EU customs territories will operate as one until the parties agree jointly that a mutually satisfactory alternative arrangement has been reached. This alternative arrangement must be such as to continue to ensure that there is no evident border in Ireland. In addition, Northern Ireland will maintain \"regulatory alignment\" with the EU, again until a mutually satisfactory alternative arrangement can be put in place for Single Market regulations as well as Customs and Excise.\n\nIn 1922 the newly established Irish Free State entered into a Common Travel Area together with the United Kingdom. This meant that passport checks were not applied as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and predates the freedom of movement provisions arising from membership of the EU, which to some degree superseded it. In 2011, the British and Irish Governments agreed informally to continue their common controls on entry to the CTA [for non-EEA nationals].\n\nIn September 2018, the British government guaranteed that free movement of EU citizens across the UK–Ireland border would continue. It has been suggested that the Norwegian model might be used. Along the Norway–Sweden border, major road crossings have customs control where all lorries are checked, but cars only occasionally, and on minor border crossings there is only video surveillance where lorries can pass with permission and pre-clearance.\n\nJohn Major has argued that Brexit might lead to a hard border since the European Union and the UK need to control their borders for customs purposes. The European Research Group faction of the Conservative Party believes that the UK might have the choice between not controlling its border if VAT is not enforced, or controlling the border in order to apply possible VAT on imported goods post-brexit.\n\nCooperation exists between the UK and Ireland on health matters, including the mutual recognition of qualifications. The Northern Ireland branch of the British Medical Association warned that a hard border \"could risk patient care\". The CEO of Cooperation and Working Together, a body that organises cross-border cooperation in health matters, suggested that the Norwegian model might be used. Along the Norway–Sweden border and other Nordic borders there is some cooperation on ambulance and helicopter pickup and on child birth clinics and some more, but otherwise health care is separated.\n"}

This method of meat production is opposed to slow bleed, ritualistic slaughter (kutha) methods such as the kosher (shechita) and halal (dhabihah).\n\n\"Jhatka\" is the method of meat production demanded by many Hindus, Sikhs, and denominational Christians, while Halal is demanded by Muslims, and Kosher by Jews.\n\n\"Jhatka\" ( \"\" ; ) is derived from Sanskrit word \"Jhatiti\" (झटिति) which means \"instantly, quickly, at once\".\n\nJhatka meat is mandated for Sikhs by the tenth Guru:\nAs stated in the official Khalsa Code of Conduct, Kutha meat is forbidden, and Sikhs are recommended to eat the jhatka form of meat.\n\nFor Sikhs, \"jhatka karna\" or \"jhatkaund\" refers to the instantaneous severing of the head of an animal with a single stroke of any weapon, with the underlying intention of killing the animal whilst causing it minimal suffering. The Sikh Rahit Maryada forbids hair-cutting, adultery, the use of intoxicants, and the consumption of kutha meat (halal meat).\n\nDuring the British Raj, jhatka meat was not allowed in jails, and Sikh detainees during the Akali movement and beyond had to resort to violence and agitations to secure this right. Among the terms in the settlement between the Akalis and the Muslim Unionist government in Punjab in 1942 was that jhatka meat be continued as a Sikh Martial Heritage.\n\nOn religious Sikh festivals, including Hola Mohalla and Vaisakhi, at the Hazur Sahib Nanded, Fatehgarh Sahib, and many other Sikh Gurdwaras, jhatka meat is offered as \"mahaprasad\" to all visitors in a Gurdwara.\n\nSome Sikh Organizations, such as the Damdami Taksal and Akhand Kirtani Jatha, have their own codes of conduct. These organizations define kutha meat as any type of slaughtered meat, and eating meat of any type is forbidden.\n\nIn the diversity of Hinduism, many Hindus are vegetarians from their belief in Ahimsa (non-injury, non-violence), and to minimize suffering to all life forms, but there is no binding religious dietary law in Hinduism, and the choice is left to the Hindu. Many Shaivite and Shakta Hindus, for example, offer meat and liquor as part of certain ritual worship, and then consume the meat. Hindus who eat meat seek jhatka meat.\n\nAll three methods use sharp knives. In the Shechita and Halal method, the animal is slaughtered by one swift, uninterrupted cut severing the trachea, esophagus, carotid arteries, jugular veins, and vagus nerves, followed by a period where the blood of the animal is drained out. In the Jhatka method, a swift uninterrupted cut severs the head and the spine.. In the Halal method, a prayer to God (Allah/Ad-nai) is required at the start or if there is any interruption during \"Shchita\" meat production, but before every slaughter in \"Halal\" meat production.\n\nIn India, there are many jhatka shops, with various bylaws requiring shops to display clearly that they sell jhatka meat.\n\nIn the past, there has been little availability of jhatka meat in the United Kingdom, so people have found themselves eating other types of meat, although jhatka has become more widely available in the United Kingdom.\n"}

In the US, job losses have been going on since December 2007, and it accelerated drastically starting in September 2008 following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. By February 2010, the American economy was reported to be more shaky than the economy of Canada. Many service industries (particularly in countries that either have the same unemployment rate as the United States or greater) have reported dropping their prices in order to maximize profit margins (looking to make use of any price elasticity of demand in their market segments). This is an era in which employment is becoming unstable, and in which being either underemployed or unemployed is a common part of life for many people. \n\nῇ\n\n\n\n\nNote: Job losses in June and July 2010 are largely attributed to US census worker jobs lost. Private sector jobs have increased during those months.\n\nSince the start of the recession, 8.8 million jobs have been lost, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nIn the U.S., jobs paying between $14 and $21 per hour made up about 60% those lost during the recession, but such mid-wage jobs have comprised only about 27% of jobs gained during the recovery through mid-2012. In contrast, lower-paying jobs constituted about 58% of the jobs regained.\n\nDrastic job loss in Canada started later than in the US. Some months in 2008 had job growth, such as September, while others such as July had losses. Due to the collapse of the American car industry at the same time as a strong Canadian dollar achieved parity +10% against a poorly-performing US dollar, the cross-border manufacturing industry has been disproportionately affected throughout.\n\n\n(1) 37,000 jobs are gained in the self-employment category\n\nWhile job creation has increased in the past three months, most Canadians still complain about people getting laid off from work. However, a growing amount of these layoffs are considered for seasonal purposes and has little or no relation to the recession. Excluding Stelco employees, most laid off workers have six months to acquire a job while collecting [unemployment benefits|unemployment insurance]]. After that, they must go on welfare and continue their job search from there.\n\n\nThe employment rate has been stabilized between 8.0% and 11.0% for the past two years; signifying the economic strength of Canada's financial institutions compared to its counterparts in the United States. Many job places in Canada (i.e., grocery stores and restaurants) have opted to reduce hours rather than lay off staff. This unemployment of job protection is especially in industries that are needed to keep the economy from going into a depression. While the automotive sector is slowly recalling workers back to work, grocery stores and restaurants have slashed hours in the face of the global recession.\n\n\nApril 2009 Australian unemployment rate: 5.5%\nJuly 2009 Australian unemployment rate: 5.8%\nAugust 2009 Australian unemployment rate: 5.8%\nSeptember 2009 Australian unemployment rate: 5.7%\nOctober 2009 Australian unemployment rate: 5.8%\n\nThe unemployment rate for October rose slightly due to population growth and other factors leading to 35,000 people looking for work, even though 24,500 jobs were created.\n\nIn general, throughout the subdued economic growth caused by the recession in the rest of the world, Australian employers have elected to cut working hours rather than fire employees, in recognition of the skill shortage caused by the resources boom.\n\nIn September 2007, approximately a year before the recession began, unemployment stood at 1,649,000.By the end of 2008, that figure had risen to 1,860,000 - an increase of 211,000 and nearly 13%.By March 2009, unemployment had increased to more than 2,000,000 - the highest level the nation had seen for more than 12 years.It reached 2,261,000 by June that year,and by April 2010 had exceeded 2,500,000 for the first time in 16 years.\n\nThe causality linking job losses to reduced business revenue is obviously grounded in reality, at least to a large extent. After all, it is self-evident that a firm with one million dollars in annual revenue cannot pay a two-million-dollar annual payroll without going into either debt or bankruptcy. However, at least some of the apparent or alleged causality is difficult to confirm quantitatively, because the data collection and analysis that would be required to do so faces high barriers to implementation, principally the privacy surrounding the accountancy. There is a common theme among working people, although it is not widely studied or reported in reliable academic or journalistic sources, along the lines that firms are \"using the recession as an excuse\" for staff reductions whose true root causes lie elsewhere, such as: \n\nThis theme also extends to compensation reduction or growth freezes, with the suspicion again being that the recession is an excuse for, e.g., wage raise freezes, wage cuts, or increasing the employees' contribution percentage for (or lowering the benefits of) company health insurance, company retirement plans, and so on. \n\nIt is very difficult to accurately detect, verify, or track the data that would be needed to test these hypotheses. Short of any outright auditing (which has no legally justifiable basis), firms have a fair amount of plausible deniability. As for the concern that productivity growth drives unemployment, the very idea is controversial, and it depends on whatever the true reality may be in the relationship of automation to unemployment. Certainly a pattern of multiple jobless recoveries, where GDP grows while employment stagnates, makes the public wonder about firms' assurances that all layoffs are necessitated by business conditions alone.\n"}

It covers the Wars of Scottish Independence, but it is also highly digressive and as such provides insights into English life in the thirteenth century as well as Scottish life. It includes Robert the Bruce.\n\nA G Little concluded that the chronicle is basically a Franciscan chronicle, which has been adapted, abbreviated, and interpolated at the Augustinian Lanercost Priory. He was able to identify the \"Chronicle\" up to 1297 as a version of a lost chronicle of 'Richard of Durham'; after that he believed a different author (with a keen interest in siege equipment and operations) to be responsible, whom he suspected to have been 'Thomas of Otterburn' whose chronicle is mentioned in the Scalachronica. The second author, says Little \"resembles the first only in being a Franciscan and a patriotic hater of the Scots\" but an additional similarity is that they are both North-country men. Where most other chroniclers are unclear on the geography of the Borders, the \"Lanercost Chronicle\" gives the name of the farmstead at which the Scots reached Tynedale in 1346. \n\nThe oldest surviving manuscript of the original Latin text is British Library Cotton Claudius D. vii.

{"id": "197060", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197060", "title": "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit", "text": "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit\n\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit (often abbreviated to Law & Order: SVU or just SVU) is an American police procedural, legal, crime drama television series set in New York City, where it is also primarily produced. In the style of the original \"Law & Order\", episodes are often \"ripped from the headlines\" or loosely based on real crimes that have received media attention. Created by Dick Wolf, the series premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999, as the second series in Wolf's successful \"Law & Order\" franchise. \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" has been nominated for and won numerous awards, including the 2006 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Mariska Hargitay, the first, and to date only, Emmy to be received by a regular on any \"Law & Order\" series. It is the current longest running scripted non-animated U.S. primetime TV series since the cancellation of the original \"Law & Order\" on May 24, 2010 and is the fourth-longest running scripted U.S. primetime TV series on a major broadcast network.\n\n\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" originally centered almost exclusively on the detectives of the Special Victims Unit in a fictional version of the 16th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. As the series progressed, additional supporting characters were added as allies of the detectives in the New York County Manhattan District Attorney's office (known as advisers from the Sex Crimes Bureau) and the Medical Examiner's office. Certain episodes will go into detail about detectives' personal lives and how they may or may not tie into the crimes dealt with during the show. Typical episodes follow the detectives and their colleagues as they investigate and prosecute sexually based offenses, child abuse, and crimes against the elderly. The show starred Christopher Meloni as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay as Detective Olivia Benson for its first twelve seasons until the former left the cast, unable to come to an agreement on his contract. As of November 29, 2018, \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" has aired 444 original episodes.\n\nOn May 9, 2018, NBC renewed the series for a twentieth season, which allowed it to tie the flagship \"Law & Order\" and \"Gunsmoke\" for the longest-running scripted drama in U.S. television history. The season premiered on September 27, 2018.\n\nThe idea for \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" originated with the 1986 \"preppie murder\" case of Robert Chambers, who strangled Jennifer Levin, a woman he dated whom he later killed during what he claimed was consensual \"rough sex\" in Manhattan's Central Park. The crime inspired Dick Wolf to write the story for the season one episode of \"Law & Order\" titled \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\". Even after writing the episode, however, the case continued to haunt Wolf, who wanted to go deeper into the psychology of crimes to examine the role of human sexuality.\n\nThe original title of the show was \"Sex Crimes\", reflecting the sexual nature of the crimes depicted on the show. Initially there was concern among the producers that, should \"Sex Crimes\" fail, identifying the new show with the \"Law & Order\" franchise could hurt the original show. Additionally, Ted Kotcheff wanted to create a new series that was not dependent upon the original series for success. Wolf felt, however, that it was important and commercially desirable to have \"Law & Order\" in the title, and he initially proposed the title of the show be \"Law & Order: Sex Crimes\". Barry Diller, then head of Studios USA, was concerned about the title, however, and it was changed to \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" to reflect the actual unit of the New York City Police Department (NYPD) that handles sexually based offenses that are especially heinous. The first episode, \"\", premiered on NBC on September 20, 1999.\n\nExecutive producer Neal Baer left \"Law & Order: SVU\" as showrunner at the end of , after eleven years (seasons 2–12) on the show, in order to sign a three-year deal with CBS Studios. Baer was replaced by former \"\" showrunner Warren Leight. In March 2015, it was announced that Warren Leight signed a three-year deal with Sony Pictures Television, that will allow him to work on \"SVU\" one more season, its seventeenth. Leight joined the show in . It was announced on March 10, 2016 that original \"Law & Order\" veteran producer Rick Eid would take Leight's place as showrunner starting in season 18. Creator Dick Wolf commented to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", \"I'm extremely pleased that Rick had decided to rejoin the family and hope that he will be here for years to come.\" During post-production of season 18, following the announcement that \"SVU\" was renewed for a nineteenth season, it was revealed that Rick Eid departed the series. He will be taking over another Dick Wolf/NBC series. \"Chicago P.D.\"\n\nIt was announced on May 25, 2017 that original \"Law & Order\" and \"Law & Order: Criminal Intent\" showrunner Michael S. Chernuchin would be reprising his role starting on season nineteen. Chernuchin was also co-creator and executive producing showrunner of \"Chicago Justice\", another Wolf-related show that was canceled by NBC at the end of the 2016–17 TV season.\n\nMany exterior scenes of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" are filmed on location in New York City, Wolf's hometown, throughout all five of New York City's boroughs. As the NYPD encounters varied law enforcement challenges on a daily basis, the backdrop provides the writers a supply of ideal locations from which to choose. Fort Lee, New Jersey served as the filming location for Detective Elliot Stabler's residence in Queens, New York.\n\nWhen searching for a place to film the interiors of the show, the producers found that there were no suitable studio spaces available in New York City. As a result, a space was chosen at NBC's Central Archives building in nearby North Bergen, New Jersey, which had sat empty for some time, and featured air-conditioning, adequate parking, and of stage area. The Archives building was used for police station and courtroom scenes, with various other locations in Hudson County used for other scenes, such as a scene shot at the Meadowlands Parkway in Secaucus in 2010. The production left New Jersey for New York in 2010, however, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie suspended the tax credits for film and television production for the Fiscal Year 2011 to close budget gaps. The show moved into the studio space at Chelsea Piers that had been occupied by the original \"Law & Order\" series until its cancellation in May 2010.\n\nThe show originally aired on Monday nights at 9:00 p.m. ET for the first nine episodes, from September 20 through November 29, 1999. It was then shifted to Friday nights at 10 p.m. ET on January 7, 2000, and remained in that time slot through the end of season four on May 16, 2003. Beginning with the season five premiere on September 23, 2003, \"SVU\" moved to Tuesday nights at 10:00 p.m. ET. NBC airs repeats on Saturday nights at varying times and previous episodes are shown on the USA Network on varying days in marathon blocks.\n\nWith the season eleven premiere on September 23, 2009, the series vacated its Tuesday 10 p.m. ET slot because NBC began a prime-time weeknight Jay Leno series. The new time slot became Wednesday nights at 9:00 p.m. ET on NBC, with CTV still airing \"SVU\" on Tuesdays at 10:00 in Canada. After the 2010 Winter Olympics on March 3, 2010, the time slot for \"SVU\" changed again to Wednesdays at 10 p.m. ET, where it stayed until the twelfth season. In the 12th season, \"SVU\" moved back to 9:00 p.m. to lead in the newest \"Law & Order\" spinoff, \"\", until it was pulled from the network in January 2011 to be retooled. \"SVU\" moved back to 10:00 p.m. on January 12, 2011, until the end of the 13th season. With season 14, \"SVU\" moved back to 9:00 p.m. after a two-hour season premiere event on September 26, 2012. Beginning with Season 20, SVU will air on Thursday nights at 10 PM, after NBC decided to devote their entire Wednesday primetime lineup to the Chicago Med, PD, and Fire trilogy. This will mark the first time ever that Law & Order SVU has held this timeslot on Thursday nights.\n\nIn 2007, the Russian production company Studio 2B purchased the rights to create an adaptation of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" for Russian television. Titled \"Закон и порядок: отдел оперативных расследований\" (\"Law & Order: Division of Field Investigation\"), the series stars Alisa Bogart as Major Olga Bobrova. The series follows a unit of investigators in Moscow whose job is to investigate crimes of a sexual nature. The series airs on NTV and is produced by Pavel Korchagin, Felix Kleiman, and Edward Verzbovski and directed by Dmitry Brusnikin. The screenplays are written by Sergei Kuznvetsov, Elena Karavaeshnikova, and Maya Shapovalova.\n\nCasting for the lead characters of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" occurred in the spring of 1999. Dick Wolf, along with officials from NBC and Studios USA were at the final auditions for the two leads at Rockefeller Center. The last round had been narrowed down to seven finalists. For the female lead, Detective Olivia Benson, actresses Samantha Mathis, Reiko Aylesworth, and Mariska Hargitay were being considered. For the male role, Detective Elliot Stabler, the finalists were Tim Matheson, John Slattery, Nick Chinlund, and Christopher Meloni. Hargitay and Meloni had auditioned in the final round together and, after the actors left, there was a moment of dead silence, after which Wolf blurted out, \"Oh well. There's no doubt who we should choose—Hargitay and Meloni.\" Wolf believed the duo had the perfect chemistry together from the first time he saw them together, and they ended up being his first choice. Garth Ancier, then head of NBC Entertainment, agreed, and the rest of the panel assembled began voicing their assent.\n\nThe first actor to be cast for the show was Dann Florek. Florek had originated the character of Captain Don Cragen in the 1988 pilot for \"Law & Order\" and played the character for the first three seasons of the show until he was fired on the orders of network executives, who wanted to add female characters to the all-male primary cast. He maintained a friendly relationship with Wolf, however, and went on to direct three episodes of the original series as well as to occasionally guest star on the show. Shortly after Florek reprised his role for \"\", he received a call to be on \"Sex Crimes\". Initially reluctant, he eventually agreed to star on the show as Cragen on the assurance that he would not be asked to audition for the role.\n\nShortly after the cancellation of \"\", Richard Belzer heard that Benjamin Bratt had left \"Law & Order\". Belzer requested his manager to call Wolf and pitch the idea for Belzer's character from \"Homicide\", Detective John Munch, to become the new partner of Jerry Orbach's character, Detective Lennie Briscoe, since they had previously teamed in three \"Homicide\" crossovers. Wolf loved the idea, but had already cast Jesse L. Martin as Briscoe's new partner, Detective Ed Green. The idea was reconfigured, however, to have Munch on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" instead. Since the character of Munch was inspired by David Simon's depiction of Detective Sergeant Jay Landsman and developed for \"Homicide\" by Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the addition of Munch to the cast required the consent of all three. The appropriate agreements were reached and, while Fontana and Levinson agreed to waive their royalty rights, contracts with Simon required that he be paid royalties for any new show in which Munch is a main character; as a result, Simon receives royalties every time Munch appears in an episode of the show.\n\nDean Winters was cast as Munch's partner, Brian Cassidy, at the insistence of Belzer. Belzer looked at Winters as a sort of little brother, and told Wolf, \"Well, I'll do this new show of yours, \"SVU\", only if you make Dean Winters my partner.\" Wolf did make Winters Belzer's partner, but he was contractually obligated to his other show at the time, the HBO drama \"Oz\". Since the role on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" was only initially meant to be a few episodes, Winters was forced to leave when it was time to film \"Oz\" again. Winters returned for the Season 13 finale, \"Rhodium Nights\", reprising his role as Cassidy. He also appeared (as Cassidy) on the two-part Season 14 premiere \"Lost Reputation\"/. He subsequently became a recurring character into season 15. The void left by Winters's departure was filled for the remainder of the season by Michelle Hurd as Detective Monique Jeffries, a character who Wolf promised that, despite starting out as a minor character with one scene in the pilot, would eventually develop. Hurd left the show at the beginning of season two to join the cast of \"Leap Years\". Munch's permanent partner came in the form of rapper-turned-actor Ice-T, who had previously worked with Wolf on \"New York Undercover\" and \"\". Ice-T originally agreed to do only four episodes of \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", but he quickly gained affection for the ensemble nature of the cast. He relocated to New York City before his four-episode contract was up and remained with the show as Munch's permanent partner, Detective Odafin \"Fin\" Tutuola.\n\nInitially, the show focused exclusively on the policework of the detectives in the Special Victims Unit of the 16th precinct, with members of the District Attorney's office occasionally appearing as guest roles crossing over from the original \"Law & Order\". From season two onwards, the format was changed to be more faithful to the original \"Law & Order\" concept by including court cases. Stephanie March had little television experience before being cast on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\", nor did she watch much TV. Nevertheless, March was cast as Assistant District Attorney Alexandra Cabot at the beginning of season two but still believed that, due to the grim nature of the series, it would be short-lived. She stayed with the series for three seasons, however, and left when she believed she had reached the natural conclusion of the character's development. She would later reprise the character as a guest appearance in season six and as a regular character on the short-lived Wolf series, \"Conviction\", where she was promised more to do. Diane Neal had previously guest starred on \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" in season three before being cast as Cabot's replacement, Casey Novak, in season five. Neal remained with the show through the end of season nine, after which she was replaced by Michaela McManus. March returned to the show in the tenth season (after McManus' departure from the cast) when Neal Baer proposed Cabot receive a character arc to revitalize the second part of the season, which would continue through season eleven.\n\nTamara Tunie was cast as medical examiner Melinda Warner in season two after working with Wolf previously on \"New York Undercover\", \"Feds\", and \"Law & Order\". Warner was initially a recurring character but became a regular character in season seven, and Tunie was added to the opening credits at that time. When initially cast as Warner, Tunie was appearing as attorney Jessica Griffin on the CBS daytime soap opera \"As the World Turns\". From 2000 to 2007 (and again briefly in 2009), she appeared on both series simultaneously. In 2002, she also appeared on the Fox espionage-themed drama series \"24\", in the recurring role of CTU Acting Director Alberta Green. BD Wong was asked to film four episodes as Dr. , a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) forensic psychiatrist and criminal profiler on loan to the Special Victims Unit. After his four episodes, he was asked to stay on with the show.\n\nAfter he starred in \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee\" and guest starred as Detective in the eighth season, Wolf felt that Adam Beach would be a good addition to the cast and asked him to be a permanent member beginning with the ninth season. Although Beach felt the role was a \"dream role\", the character proved unpopular with fans who felt that he was designed to gradually write out either Richard Belzer or Ice-T. Feeling there were too many police characters on the show, Beach left the show after only one season. Michaela McManus was originally felt to be too young for the role of an Assistant District Attorney (ADA) before being cast as ADA Kim Greylek in the tenth season. McManus, months removed from a recurring role on \"One Tree Hill\", remained with the series only half a season, however, before departing for unspecified reasons.\n\nPaula Patton joined the cast as ADA Mikka Von. She replaced Stephanie March. However, Patton dropped out after one episode to film \"\", and was replaced by Melissa Sagemiller in the recurring role of ADA Gillian Hardwicke.\n\nBefore the end of season twelve, Mariska Hargitay asked for a lighter workload. As a way of writing her out of certain episodes, a plan to have her character promoted to a supervisory role was discussed. At the end of season twelve, Christopher Meloni departed the cast, unable to come to terms with his contract. Warren Leight became the new showrunner during this same year and signed on before he knew that Meloni would be leaving the cast. The second major departure to be announced in 2011 was that of BD Wong. On July 17, Wong announced on Twitter that, \"I actually do not return for season 13, I am jumping to \"Awake\"! It's awesome!\" Wong added, \"I don't know if or when I'll be back on \"SVU\"! It was amazing to have such a cool job for 11 years and to be a real NY Actor.\" Wong reprised his role as Dr. Huang in season 13's episode \"\". In response to these departures, two new main actors were hired, and several changes were made to the recurring cast.\n\nIn June 2011, it was announced that Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino would join the cast as new series regulars. Weeks later, it was announced that Stephanie March and Diane Neal would be reprising their roles as ADA Alexandra Cabot and ADA Casey Novak, respectively. The launch of season 13 was marked with a retooling of the show that Warren Leight referred to as \"SVU 2.0\". Changes that accompanied this included Tamara Tunie's being bumped from the main cast to a guest starring role and recurring actor Joel de la Fuente's not appearing for the first time since 2002. Of the latter change, Warren Leight said, \"those scenes [which featured Fuente] can be dry\" and hired Gilbert Gottfried as a more comedic replacement. In addition to these changes, Linus Roache became a recurring cast member in his role of Michael Cutter, whom he played on \"Law & Order\"; on \"SVU\" former Executive ADA Cutter serves as the Bureau Chief for ADAs attached to the Special Victims Unit.\n\nIn season 14, Raúl Esparza joined the cast in a recurring capacity as ADA Rafael Barba and prior to the season 15 premiere, Esparza was promoted to a series regular. Also in season 15, Belzer departed the cast in the fifth episode, \"Wonderland Story\", in which Sgt. Munch retired from the NYPD and took a job in the DA's office as an investigator. Later in the season, Captain Cragen announced his departure from the NYPD, which made newly promoted Sgt. Benson the temporary squad commander. In leaving the cast, Florek ended a 400-episode run as Captain Cragen. In season 16, Peter Scanavino joined the series, first in a recurring role for episodes 1–3 and then was promoted to the main cast in episode 5, with Kelli Giddish, Danny Pino, Ice-T and Raúl Esparza no longer appearing in every episode. On May 20, 2015, it was revealed that Danny Pino would be leaving the cast after the season 16 finale \"Surrendering Noah\".\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Philip Winchester will recur in season 19 as ADA Peter Stone, his character from \"Chicago P.D.\" and \"Chicago Justice\", who is the son of Benjamin Stone, the ADA on the original \"Law & Order\" show. It was later also announced that Brooke Shields was enlisted to assume a major recurring role starting in Season 19 of the long-running dramatic series. On February 7, 2018, Raúl Esparza left the series after six seasons.\n\nBy season twelve, both Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni had become among the highest-paid lead actors on a drama, with each earning nearly $400,000 per episode, a salary that \"TV Guide\" said was exceeded only by \"House\"&apos;s Hugh Laurie. During season sixteen, Hargitay was reported to be earning $450,000 per episode, or $10,350,000 per season, In season seventeen, her salary increased to $500,000 per episode.\n\n\nBased out of the New York City Police Department's 16th precinct in Manhattan, \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" delves into the dark side of the New York underworld as the detectives of a new elite force, the Special Victims Unit (SVU for short), investigate and prosecute various sexually-oriented crimes including rape, pedophilia, and domestic violence. They also investigate the abuses of children, the disabled and elderly victims of non-sexual crimes who require specialist handling. All the while trying to balance the effects of the investigation on their own lives. Its stories also touch on the political and societal issues associated with gender identity, sexual preferences, and equality rights. While the victim is often murdered, this is not always the case, and victims frequently play prominent roles in episodes. The unit also works with the Manhattan District Attorney's office as they prosecute cases and seek justice for SVU's victims and survivors with precision and a passion to win and bring closure to the intense investigations. The series often uses stories that are \"ripped from the headlines\" or based on real crimes. Such episodes take a real crime and fictionalize it by changing some details.\n\nOriginally the show focused around the detective pairings of Elliot Stabler & Olivia Benson and John Munch & Brian Cassidy. Stabler is a seasoned veteran of the unit who has seen it all and tries his best to protect his family from the horrors he sees every day. His partner Benson's difficult past as the child of a rape victim is the reason she joined the unit. Backing them up is John Munch, and his first partner Brian Cassidy. Munch is a transfer from Baltimore's homicide unit, who brings his acerbic wit, conspiracy theories, and street-honed investigative skills. While Cassidy is young and eager to learn from his fellow detectives. These two detective teams received support from Detectives Monique Jeffries and Ken Briscoe. When Cassidy transferred to Narcotics after thirteen episodes, Jeffries was partnered with Munch for the remaining of Season One and Briscoe was phased out. In the beginning of season two, Munch was then permanently partnered with Detective Odafin \"Fin\" Tutuola, whose unique yet sometimes vulgar sense of humor and investigative experience make him a formidable match for Munch. These detectives were supervised by veteran Captain Donald Cragen who oversaw the team from seasons 1–15. Cragen's tough-but-supportive approach to the team's complex cases guides the squad through the challenges they face every day. Also on the team's payroll is FBI Special Agent Dr. George Huang and Medical Examiner Dr. Melinda Warner. As the resident psychiatrist for the Special Victims Unit, Huang helps keep the officers sane in a field that could drive ordinary people mad. He has also served as the squad's resident criminal profiler, and his insights into the criminal mind have often helped the officers to crack the toughest perps, while Warner has become an integral part of the Manhattan Special Victims Unit, and her personal skills have contributed to the unit's high success rate in closing cases.\n\nThe Unit did not receive a full-time assistant district attorney until season two, when Alexandra Cabot was assigned to work with the detectives. After Cabot's departure in season five, she was replaced by Casey Novak, who remained as the ADA until the end of season nine. Kim Greylek became the permanent ADA in the season ten premiere, until Cabot made a return midway through that season when Greylek departed. Cabot remained the ADA through the second half of season eleven. After Cabot's departure, the ADA void was filled by Sonya Paxton (Christine Lahti) and Jo Marlowe (Sharon Stone) until the conclusion of season eleven. Gillian Hardwicke served as the SVU ADA during season twelve. In season thirteen, both Cabot and Novak returned as ADAs. From the beginning of season fourteen, ADA Rafael Barba had been SVU's prosecutor, until leaving halfway through season nineteen. \"Chicago Justice\"'s Peter Stone became SVU's ADA after \"Chicago Justice\" was canceled after only one season.\n\nIn season 13, other big changes happened when Stabler left in the season twelve finale. Detectives Nick Amaro and Amanda Rollins joined the team filling the void left by Stabler. Amaro brings empathy to his cases while dealing with a stressful home life, while Rollins' dogged persistence and instincts help her close cases, but her secrets could derail her career. In the current seasons, the Manhattan SVU is now run by Lieutenant Olivia Benson.\n\n\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" has started its twentieth season. Each season has aired on NBC and consists of 19 to 25 episodes, each lasting approximately forty minutes (sixty minutes including commercials).\n\n\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" premiered on Monday, September 20, 1999. After nine episodes, the show was moved to Friday nights, where it found its audience and following its first and second seasons became a Top 20-overall show, overcoming the \"Friday night death slot\" phenomenon. Beginning with the season five, the show aired on Tuesdays to compete with CBS' \"Judging Amy\" and ABC's \"NYPD Blue\". In its later years, \"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" consistently outperformed \"Law & Order\" in the Nielsen ratings for first run episodes until the latter's cancellation in 2010.\n\nIn 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that \"SVU\"s popularity was \"atypical: generally slightly more popular in rural areas and the Black Belt, but largely restricted to the eastern half of the country. It's most popular in Albany, N.Y.; least in Colorado and Utah\".\n\n\"Note: Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May (with the exception of the second and tenth season), which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.\"\n\n\"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit\" has received many awards and award nominations. Mariska Hargitay has twice been nominated for a Golden Globe Award and won once in 2005.\n\nThe show has been nominated numerous times for the Emmy Award. Mariska Hargitay has been nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category 8 years in a row beginning in 2004 and won the Emmy in 2006. Christopher Meloni was nominated for the Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series category in 2006. Robin Williams was nominated in the Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series in 2008. The series was nominated in the category Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for Jane Alexander and Tracy Pollan in 2000, Martha Plimpton in 2002, Barbara Barrie in 2003, Mare Winningham and Marlee Matlin in 2004, Amanda Plummer and Angela Lansbury in 2005, Marcia Gay Harden and Leslie Caron in 2007, Cynthia Nixon in 2008, Ellen Burstyn, Brenda Blethyn, and Carol Burnett in 2009, and Ann-Margret in 2010. The series won the award for Plummer in 2005, Caron in 2007, Nixon in 2008, Burstyn in 2009, and Margret in 2010.\n\n\"Law and Order SVU\" airs on NBC in the United States.

The latest 5 episodes can be watched for free on NBC.com and the NBC app. Outside of SVOD and NBC platforms, most episodes (outside of seasons 2-4 in the United States for reasons unknown) can be found on electronic sell-through platforms such as iTunes and Amazon Video. The show airs every Thursday night, on Network Ten in Australia, with a new episode usually followed by a repeat and occasionally shows repeats on other nights. Ten's digital channel One sometimes shows Seasons One-Three on Friday or Saturday nights, but is not currently airing these seasons at the moment.

{"id": "852078", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=852078", "title": "Mohammed al-Qahtani", "text": "Mohammed al-Qahtani\n\nMohammed Mana Ahmed al-Qahtani () (sometimes transliterated as al-Kahtani) (born November 19, 1979) is a Saudi citizen who has been detained as an al-Qaeda Agent since June 2002 in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps in Cuba. Qahtani allegedly tried to enter the United States to take part in the September 11 attacks as the 20th hijacker and was due to be onboard Flight 93 along with the four other hijackers. He was refused entry due to suspicions that he was trying to immigrate. He was later captured in Afghanistan in the battle of Tora Bora in December 2001.\n\nAfter military commissions were authorized by Congress, in February 2008, Qahtani was charged on numerous counts. In May, the charges were dropped without prejudice. New charges were filed against him in November 2008 and dropped in January 2009, as evidence had been obtained through torture and was inadmissible in court. This was the first time an official of the Bush administration had admitted any torture of detainees at Guantanamo.\n\nIn a \"Washington Post\" interview in January 2009, Susan Crawford of the Department of Defense said that the U.S. government had so abused Qahtani through isolation, sleep deprivation, forced nudity and exposure to cold that he was in a \"life-threatening condition.\"\n\nMohammed al-Qahtani was born in 1979 in Kharj, Saudi Arabia. He is a Saudi national from a large sunni family. His father served as a police officer for 28 years. His mother remained at home to raise their twelve children. He has seven brothers and four sisters, who range in age from 14 to 42 years of age.\n\nOn August 3, 2001, Qahtani at the age of 21 flew into Orlando, Florida, from Dubai. He was questioned by immigration agent José Meléndez-Pérez, who was dubious that he could support himself with only $2,800 cash to his name, and suspicious that he intended to become an illegal immigrant, as he was using a one-way ticket. He was sent back to Dubai, and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia.\n\nCaptured in the Battle of Tora Bora, Qahtani was shipped by the Americans with other detainees to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp set up at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He continued giving a false name, and insisted he had been in the area solely to pursue an interest in falconry.\n\nAfter ten months, U.S. Border and Immigration Authorities took a fingerprint sample and discovered that he was the same person who had tried to enter the United States just before the September 11 attacks. Seizing the airports CCTV surveillance recrodings, the FBI claimed they were able to identify the car of Mohamed Atta at the airport, believed there to pick up Qahtani.\nAnother military account stated that Qahtani was identified as someone who had previously been turned away due to visa problems – by fingerprints \"taken in Southwest Asia\".\n\nAt that time, the military invited FBI interrogators to interview Qahtani. By the fall of 2002, they were frustrated by his resistance. DOD interrogators talked of using different techniques, based on a class they attended.\n\nShortly after September 26, 2002, top administration political appointees: David Addington, the VP's chief of staff; Alberto Gonzales, then White House Counsel; John A. Rizzo of the CIA; William Haynes II, General Counsel of DOD; his legal assistant, Jack Goldsmith; and two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, flew to Camp Delta to view Qahtani and talk with his interrogators. They were trying to develop ways to break down detainee resistance and had come up with a list of potential techniques to be used.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver, the top legal adviser at Guantanamo, suggested to her command in Defense that acting with \"pure intent\" was important, and they might seek immunity from \"command authorities\" prior to using such harsh interrogation techniques. (In August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, had provided legal opinions (later called the Torture Memos) to the CIA that narrowly defined torture and authorized the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, since commonly defined as torture).\n\nThe political appointees went on to Charleston, South Carolina to view Jose Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia to view Yaser Esam Hamdi. These men were United States citizens. Like the foreign detainees in Guantanamo, they were held in solitary confinement, where most human contact was with their interrogators, according to a theory about how to develop dependence among prisoners, for long-term gathering of intelligence by interrogators. At this time, none of the detainees, including the American citizens, had access to counsel or federal courts.\n\nQahtani had initially been interrogated by FBI agents, who used standard techniques based in police work. On December 2, 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld authorized in writing the use of 17 enhanced interrogation techniques to be used against Qahtani (see next section). After details of Qahtani's status were leaked in 2004, the US Department of Defense issued a press release stating that Qahtani had admitted:\n\nAl-Qahtani is also said to have informed interrogators that he had received operational training in covert communications from Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, whom he identified as a courier for Osama bin Laden. This was an early lead at a time when the hunt for bin Laden by other means had ground to a halt, but, as the national security expert Peter Bergen has noted, it had to be combined with another eight years of work, relying on a wide variety of techniques of intelligence-gathering, to culminate in the US government's 2011 raid on the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killing of the al-Qaeda leader.\n\nAt Guantánamo, Mohammed al-Qahtani was subjected to a regime of 17 aggressive interrogation techniques, known as the \"First Special Interrogation Plan,\" authorized in writing by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, and implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo, Major General Geoffrey Miller. After complaints from military investigators, the list of approved techniques was reduced.\n\nThe special interrogation plan and techniques were not revealed until 2008 in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee during its investigation of detainee treatment, and were reported by the FBI Inspector General, Glenn Fine. The authorized techniques were related to those described in the three August 2002 legal opinions, later known as the Torture Memos, drafted by John Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued to the CIA.\n\nUnder these coercive techniques, Qahtani gave additional information, including naming 30 other prisoners as working directly for bin Laden. The military used this information as justification to hold the men as enemy combatants. But, because the material was extracted under torture, it was later considered inadmissible in court. Qahtani later recanted this testimony, saying he had given the names of other detainees only to stop the abuse.\n\nIt was not until February 2008 that Qahtani was first charged before a military commission, and the prosecution dropped the charges in May of that year. He was charged again in November 2008, but on January 14, 2009, Susan J. Crawford, a senior Pentagon official of the Bush administration, stated that she would not proceed with his prosecution. She said that Qahtani's \"treatment met the legal definition of torture... The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive\". As convening authority of the military commissions, Crawford was responsible for overseeing the Guantanamo military commissions. Her statement was the first time any top official of the Bush administration had said there was torture of detainees at Guantanamo.\n\nGitanjali Gutierrez, a defense lawyer for al-Qahtani who works for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, has said she thought Qahtani's torture constituted a war crime.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, \"Time\" magazine published the secret log of 49 days of the 20-hour-per-day interrogation of Qahtani at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from late November 2002 to early January 2003. This had been leaked to the press. The log described Qahtani being forcibly administered intravenous fluids, drugs, and enemas, in order to keep his body functioning well enough for the interrogations to continue. The log, titled \"SECRET ORCON INTERROGATION LOG DETAINEE 063\", offers a daily, detailed account of the enhanced interrogation techniques used from November 23, 2002, to January 11, 2003.\n\nThese included the following:\n\nThe interrogation log does not record Qahtani admitting to being a member of al-Qaeda. The entry for January 1, 2003, relates that Qahtani blames Osama bin Laden for deceiving the 19 9/11 hijackers (\"his friends\"):\n\n2A0780 asked how one man, Bin Laden, convince 19 young men to kill themselves, (detainee was starting to fade he was going in and out of sleep.) The question was repeated, detainee stated that they were tricked, that he distorted the picture if front of them, 2A0780 asked detainee if this made him mad, detainee stated yes, (detainee did not realize that 2A780 had not started putting detainee into the picture) 2A0780 asked detainee if he was mad that his friends had been tricked, detainee said yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his friends knew about the plan, detainee said no, 2A0780 asked if detainee knew about the plan, detainee stated that he didn't know. 2A0780 asked detainee if it made him mad that he killed his friends, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if he was glad that he didn't die on the plane, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his parents were happy that he didn't die detainee stated yes. 2A0780 stated \"he killed your friends\" detainee stated yes.\n\nWhen asked about his greatest sins in his life, Qahtani responded that he had not taken care of his parents properly, had not finished college, and had not been able to repay $20,000 he had borrowed from his aunt.\n\nOn March 3, 2006, Qahtani's lawyer Gitanjali Gutierrez said that her client had recanted the accusations he had made against fellow detainees during earlier periods of interrogation under torture. He had told his lawyer that he was forced to falsely confess and name names, in order to get his \"enhanced interrogation\" to end. He had accused 30 other detainees of being former bodyguards of Osama bin Laden.\n\nGiven the circumstances of how Qahtani's confessions were obtained, lawyers for the other detainees argued that his testimony should not be used by the military as justification to detain their clients. They used this argument in their petitions for \"habeas corpus\" challenges for their clients. The government argued that, under the Detainee Treatment Act (2005), detainees could not use the federal courts for \"habeas corpus\" except on appeal.\n\nIn its decision in \"Hamdan v. Rumsfeld\" (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that the Detainee Treatment Act and the military commissions as established by the Department of Defense were unconstitutional for depriving detainees of \"habeas corpus\" and rights of due process, and that the military commissions had not been authorized by Congress.\n\nIn the fall of 2006, Congress quickly passed and the President signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. It responded to the Court's concerns but mandated the restriction of detainees to the military commission system.\n\nOn February 9, 2008, the \"New York Times\" reported that the Office of Military Commissions was close to laying charges against six of the high-value detainees at Guantanamo, including Qahtani. He was believed to have been the planned 20th hijacker for the 9/11 attacks.\n\nQahtani and the other five were charged on February 11, 2008, with war crimes and murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted. Gitanjali Gutierrez, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), was representing Qahtani. Attorneys at CCR denounced the systematic use of torture against detainees and challenged the validity of the military commission. They said that evidence in Qahtani's death penalty case was obtained by torture.\n\nIn their February 2008 press release, CCR said that \"the military commissions at Guantanamo allow secret evidence, hearsay evidence, and evidence obtained through torture. They are unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice.\" \n\nAccording to his lawyer, in early April 2008, al-Qahtani tried to kill himself after learning that he faced charges that could carry the death penalty. He cut himself at least three times, causing \"profuse bleeding\" that needed hospital treatment.\n\nOn May 11, 2008, the government charges against al-Qahtani were dropped. Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that it was possible for the charges to be re-instated, at a later date, because they had been dropped \"without prejudice\".\n\nOn November 18, 2008, Chief Prosecutor Lawrence Morris announced that he was filing new charges against Qahtani. When announcing the new charges, Morris stated that the new charges were based on \"independent and reliable evidence\". He stated: “His conduct is significant enough that he falls into the category of people who ought to be held accountable by being brought to trial.”\n\nSusan Crawford, the senior official in charge of the Office of Military Commissions, has the final authority over whether charges were laid. On January 14, 2009, after a change in administrations, Crawford ruled that the prosecution would not proceed against Qahtani because he had been subjected to interrogation techniques in Guantanamo that rose to the level of torture. Bryan Whitman, a DOD spokesman, said that the techniques were legal at the time they were applied, according to Department of Justice legal opinions.\n\nMohammed al-Qahtani's \"habeas corpus\" case was reinstated in July 2008 after the Supreme Court ruled in \"Boumediene v. Bush,\" stating that Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to \"habeas corpus\" and the right to petition federal courts.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, he made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo.\nHe promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system, convening a task force to review material on detainees that was made up of officials from six agencies, whereas the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. Reporting back a year later, the Joint Review Task Force recommended release and repatriation of 53 detainees. It classified other individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, although there was insufficient evidence to charge them with crimes. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Some 71 detainees were determined to be eligible for a Periodic Review Board assessment, similar to a parole board, to determine if they could be released.\nMohammed al Qahtani was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.\nObama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. Qahtani was denied approval for transfer on July 18, 2016.\n\nOn 2 September 2014, a judicial panel for the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York stated that pictures and videos of Qahtani, taken while in detention, should remain classified. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented Mohammed al-Qahtani for this federal lawsuit, had sought to disclose these audiovisual materials under the Freedom of Information Act. The judges decided that the release of these pictures and videos \"could logically and plausibly harm national security because these images are uniquely susceptible to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite violence against United States interests domestically and abroad\". On March 9, 2015, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in his case.\n\nIn a review of the drama film \"Zero Dark Thirty\" (2012) about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Peter Bergen, a national security analyst, compared the character of Ammar and the issue of torture to the treatment of Qahtani in detention. In a controversial passage, Ammar is interrogated under torture in the film and gives up the name of a bin Laden courier. Bergen notes that although Qahtani gave a name under alleged torture, it took another eight years, with US analysts using every form of intelligence-gathering from high technology to 'people on the ground,' for the government to locate and kill Osama bin Laden. Other sources later suggested the character of Ammar was based on Ammar al-Baluchi.\n\n\n"}

In 1978, he revoked the ban on the Jamaat-e-Islami, which was widely believed to have collaborated with the Pakistani army and members of which are alleged to have committed war crimes against civilians.\n\nGhulam Azam, the exiled chief of the Jammat-e-Islami, was allowed to come back to Bangladesh in July 1978. In 1991 December Ghulam Azam, was elected the Amir of Jamaat-e-Islam. Subsequently, Jahanara Imam organized the Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee (Committee to exterminate the Killers and Collaborators), and became its public face. The committee called for the trial of people who committed crimes against humanity in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War in collaboration with the Pakistani forces. The Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee set up mock trials in Dhaka in March 1992 known as Gonoadalot (Court of the people) and 'sentenced' persons they accused of being war criminals. Imam and others were charged with treason. This charge was, however, dropped in 1996 after her death by the Chief Advisor Mohammed Habibur Rahman of the Caretaker government of that time.\n\nThe activities of the \"Ekattorer Ghatak-Dalal Nirmul Committee\" led by Jahanara Imam were deemed unlawful by the Government of Bangladesh.\n\nSector Commanders Forum calls for protest.\n\nOn 2007, at the regime of military backed Caretaker government, students of Govt.

On that day, the International Crimes Tribunal had sentenced Abdul Quader Mollah to life in prison after he was convicted on five of six counts of war crimes. Later demands included banning the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party from politics and a boycott of institutions supporting (or affiliated with) the party.\n\n\n"}

Typically four operas, all sung in English, are presented each season, which runs from late May to late June. Performances are accompanied by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, which is divided into two ensembles, each covering two of the operas, for the season. The company's performances are presented in the Loretto-Hilton Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of Webster University. \n\nIn 1976, Leigh Gerdine, Laurance L. Browning, Jr. and James Van Sant co-founded OTSL. They hired Richard Gaddes, who at the time was working at The Santa Fe Opera, as the company's first Artistic Director. They signed him as full-time General Director in 1978 at the suggestion of Ed Korn, who was brought in as a consultant from the Metropolitan Opera. Gaddes acknowledged that the model for OTSL was The Santa Fe Opera:\n\nThe first season in 1976 presented eleven performances of Britten's \"Albert Herring\", Mozart's \"The Impresario\", Menotti's \"The Medium\", and Donizetti's \"Don Pasquale.\" This mixture of some standard works, and some new and unconventional operas, was to continue in future seasons and characterize the company's approach. This was achieved on a budget of $135,000. The young singers included Sheri Greenawald and Vinson Cole. \nDuring the early seasons, the company had a major influence with such achievements as first joint BBC/WNET telecast of \"Albert Herring\" and in 1983 the first appearance by any U.S. opera company at the Edinburgh International Festival. The first production of a Japanese opera in Japan by any American company was followed by a return to Tokyo in September 2001 to present the Japanese premiere of the classic \"Genji Monogatari,\" adapted as an opera by Minoru Miki as \"The Tale of Genji\".\n\nWell-known directors Graham Vick, Jonathan Miller, and Mark Lamos have made U.S. operatic debuts with OTSL, as did conductors Leonard Slatkin and Christopher Hogwood. Colin Graham served as OTSL's Director of Productions from 1978-1985. John Nelson was OTSL's Music Director from 1985 to 1988, and Principal Conductor from 1988 to 1991.\n\nOther notable U.S. singers, including Christine Brewer, Susan Graham, Denyce Graves, Dwayne Croft, Thomas Hampson, Jerry Hadley, Patricia Racette, Sylvia McNair, and Stephanie Blythe have made appearances in St. Louis productions. OTSL has presented 14 world premieres, including Stephen Paulus' \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" in 1982, \"The Loss of Eden\" by Cary John Franklin in 2002; David Carlson's \"Anna Karenina\", with a libretto by Colin Graham; Terence Blanchard's Champion (2013), with a libretto by the Pulitzer Prize-winning Michael Cristofer; and Ricky Ian Gordon's \"Twenty-Seven\", with a libretto by Royce Vavrek. The last two operas have been part of the most recent OTSL series of commissioning new operas, under the \"New Works, Bold Voices\" initiative. The third opera in this cycle is planned to be \"Shalimar the Clown\", with music by Jack Perla and libretto by Rajiv Joseph, scheduled for presentation in the 2016 OTSL season. In addition, OTSL has given 14 American premieres, including Michael Berkeley's \"Jane Eyre\"; Benjamin Britten's \"Paul Bunyan\"; Rossini's \"Il viaggio a Reims\" \"(The Journey to Reims)\"; and Judith Weir's \"The Vanishing Bridegroom\".\n\nThe company trains young artists in the Gerdine Young Artists program, named for Opera Theatre's founding board chairman, Leigh Gerdine. The Gerdine Young Artists serve as the annual chorus for the company, as the company does not retain a resident chorus. OTSL chorus directors have included Donald Palumbo, Cary John Franklin, Sandra Horst, and Robert Ainsley. \n\nSucceeding Gaddes as OTSL General Director was Charles MacKay, who held the post from 1985 to 2008. MacKay had previously served as OTSL Executive Director, beginning in 1984. MacKay led the campaign to construct and fund the new Sally S. Levy Opera Center, a new and permanent administrative home and year-round rehearsal facility for the organisation. In addition, in 2005, OTSL adopted projected English-language supertitles in the theatre. From 1985 until his death in April 2007, the OTSL Artistic Director was Colin Graham. From 1991 to 2017, OTSL's Music Director was Stephen Lord. Lord now has the title of OTSL music director emeritus. In June 2017, OTSL announced the appointment of Roberto Kalb as its resident conductor, effective with the 2018 season. \n\nIn September 2007, OTSL named James Robinson as the company's next Artistic Director, and Timothy O'Leary to the position of Executive Director. MacKay concluded his OTSL tenure as General Director on September 30, 2008. In June 2008, OTSL named O'Leary as its third General Director, effective October 1, 2008. O'Leary concluded his OTSL general directorship on June 30, 2018. In April 2018, OTSL announced the appointment of Andrew Jorgensen as its next general director, effective July 2, 2018. Robinson is currently contracted as OTSL artistic director through 2021.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

It comprised approximately 200 tents and was situated near Lake Ostrovo, Macedonia during the First World War under the command of the Serbian Army.\nIt was often called The America Unit as the money to fund it came from America and except for a few dressing stations, it was the Allied hospital nearest the front.\n\nThe unit opened in September 1916 soon after the Battle of Malka Nidzhe (Gornichevo ridge). Gornichevo ridge formed the twin summits of Kaimaktsalan, 7,700 and 8,200 feet above sea level. This ridge had to be captured before Monastir (Bitola on modern British maps) could be re-taken. The first Chief Medical Officer, an Australian, Dr Agnes Elizabeth Lloyd Bennett recorded on the first day that they took 24 cases: \"all terribly bad wounds - abdominal, chest, head and compound fractures.\" On 25 September she wrote: \"We now have 160 cases, all bad and it is terribly hard work.\" During the first eight weeks the America Unit admitted 425 cases of whom sixty died.\n\nThe unit was approximately ninety miles west of Salonika and was in a beautiful location. According to its third CMO Dr Isobel Emslie: \"It lay quite by itself on a green sward in the hollow of the hills which rose on every side; close by was a clump of ancient elm-trees, the home of families of cawing rooks, and beyond the white tents of the hospital lay Lake Ostrovo.\"\n\nMiles Franklin wrote: \"The royal sunlight on the purple hills! Blue as heaven, high and peaked like cats' teeth, they intensified a longing for the Blue Bogongs that was ten years poignant.\" Franklin was inspired to write a story, \"By Far Kaimaktchalan\" and a piece entitled \"Somewhere in the Balkans\" but finished neither. \"Ne Mari Nishta\" remains her only finished account of her time there. She left in February 1918.\n\nThe America Unit was the fourth unit of the Scottish Women's Hospitals in which at least ten Australian women served including Agnes Bennett, Mary De Garis and the novelist Miles Franklin. Other Australians served in a similar unit near Salonika. The Anglo-Irish medical physicist Edith Anne Stoney provided x-ray support to the unit while being based at Salonika.\n\nIn Dr Isobel Emslie's words: \"The spirit of this unit was a very pleasant one; the big, happy family of women was so entirely thrown on its own resources that it formed a very united body. Most of the sisters had been so much with the Serbians that they had learnt the language and were thoroughly in sympathy with them. Ours was a Serbian Army hospital, and we took our orders directly from Army Headquarters.\"\nAt the advanced dressing station established three hours drive further up Kaimaktsalan the unit took casualties direct from the battlefield. Dr Bennett wrote of the girls' courage during bombardment. However malaria and dysentery took such a toll on the staff that the station was closed in September 1917.\n\nOn 30 September 1918 the unit received news of the armistice with Bulgaria and on the morning of 23 October the unit started for northern Serbia with a convoy of nine vehicles on a 311 kilometre trek. All the staff made the trip and the unit set up in an abandoned army barracks in Vranje. The unit was in operation until October 1919. Fifty two of the members of the Vranje Unit were decorated with the Royal Red Cross and several also received the Order of Saint Sava.\n\n"}

PAX festival events are held annually in Seattle, Washington; Boston, Massachusetts; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Antonio, Texas; and Melbourne, Australia. PAX was originally created by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, the authors of the \"Penny Arcade\" webcomic, because they wanted to attend a show exclusively for gaming.\n\nPAX was first held in 2004. Defining characteristics of the festivals include an opening keynote speech from an industry insider, game-culture inspired concerts, panels on game topics, exhibitor booths from both independent and major game developers and publishers, a LAN party multiplayer, tabletop gaming tournaments, and video game freeplay areas. Every PAX also features the Omegathon, a festival-long tournament consisting of a group of randomly selected attendees competing for a grand prize. The final round of the Omegathon makes up part of the closing ceremonies of PAX. Past games for the final round of the Omegathon have included \"Tetris\", \"Pong\", \"Halo 3\", and skee-ball.\n\nThe first PAX, known at the time as the \"Penny Arcade\" Expo, was held on August 28–29, 2004, in Bellevue, Washington, at the Meydenbauer Center, and was attended by approximately 3,300 people. The event was then held annually in August, at the same venue, for the next two years. Attendance grew rapidly, with over 9,000 attendees in 2005, and over 19,000 in 2006.\nBy 2007, the event had outgrown its previous venue, and moved to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, which was twice the size. Attendance in 2007 was counted at 39,000. In 2008, attendance grew to 58,500, and in 2009, it grew to 60,750.\n\nIn 2010, PAX held its first event on the East Coast. PAX East 2010 was held in Boston, from March 26–28, at the Hynes Convention Center. Attendance levels rivaled those of PAX 2009; PAX East 2010 was attended by 52,290. From then on, the original Washington festival was referred to as PAX Prime in order to avoid confusion between the two. PAX Prime 2010 was attended by 67,600 people, and involved off-site events for the first time.\n\nPAX Prime 2011 was attended by over 70,000 people. For the two days prior to PAX Prime, an event called PAX Dev was held; it was exclusive to the game developer community, no press were permitted, and it was attended by 750 people. This supplemental event was created as a forum where \"developers [could] speak freely and focus entirely on their trade\". The same year, the second annual PAX East was held in March 2011, at a new venue, the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.\nPAX East 2012 was held April 6–8, and PAX Prime 2012 was held from August 31 to September 2, on Labor Day weekend.\nPAX East 2013 took place March 22–24. 2013 also marked the first year that a PAX event was held outside of the United States; PAX Australia 2013 was held July 19–21, 2013 at the Melbourne Showgrounds. PAX Prime 2013 was the first four-day PAX and took place from August 30 to September 2, 2013. Passes for PAX Prime 2013 sold out within six hours.\n\nAn agreement reached in early 2012 has extended Boston as the home of PAX East until 2023.\nPAX Australia 2014 was held at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre on October 31 to November 2, 2014, where it was confirmed that the exhibition will remain in Melbourne until 2019. The first PAX South was held in San Antonio, Texas at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center on January 23–25, 2015. It set a PAX record for highest attendance for an inaugural year.\n\nPAX East 2015 was held on March 6–8 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. PAX Prime 2015 was held at the Washington State Convention Center on August 28–31. PAX Australia 2015 was held on Melbourne Cup weekend, on October 30 to November 1 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, it was silently confirmed that PAX Prime was being renamed to \"PAX West\".\n\nPAX South 2016 was held on January 29–31 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. \nPAX East 2016 was held on April 22–24 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. \nPAX West 2016 (formerly PAX Prime) was held on September 2–5 at the Washington State Convention Center. \nPAX Australia 2016 was held on November 4–6 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nPAX South 2017 was held on January 27–29 at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas. During this time, it was announced that Penny Arcade would be hosting another event known as PAXUnplugged. Designed as a tabletop-exclusive convention, it took place November 17–19, 2017 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, in Philadelphia. PAX East was held on March 10–12 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. \nPAX West 2017 was held on September 1–4, 2017 at the Washington State Convention Center. PAX Dev 2017 was held on August 29–30, 2017. PAX Aus 2017 was held on October 27-29, 2017 at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nPAX South 2018 was held on January 12-14, 2018. \nPAX East 2018 was held on April 5-8, 2018. 2018 was the first year PAX East spanned 4 days, similar to PAX West. Unlike West, it ran from a Thursday to a Sunday, as opposed to a Friday to a Monday.\n"}
{"id": "621101", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=621101", "title": "Parilia", "text": "Parilia\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Parilia is a festival of rural character performed annually on 21 April, aimed at cleansing both sheep and shepherd. It is carried out in acknowledgment to the Roman deity Pales, a deity of uncertain gender who was a patron of shepherds and sheep.\n\nOvid describes the Parilia at length in the \"Fasti\", an elegiac poem on the Roman religious calendar, and implies that it predates the founding of Rome, traditionally 753 BC, as indicated by its pastoral, pre-agricultural concerns. During the Republic, farming was idealized and central to Roman identity, so the festival took on a more generally rural character. Increasing urbanization caused the rustic Parilia to be reinterpreted rather than abandoned, as Rome was an intensely traditional society. During the Imperial period, the date was celebrated as the \"birthday\" of Rome \"(dies natalis Romae)\".\n\nThe pastoral structure of the festival is carried out by the shepherd himself. After the sheep pen had been decorated with green branches and a wreath draped on the gate, the remainder of the ceremony took place in sequence. At the first sign of daylight, the shepherd would purify the sheep: by sweeping the pen and then constructing a bonfire of straw, olive branches, laurel, and sulfur. The noises produced by this burning combination were interpreted as a beneficial omen. The shepherd would jump through this flame, dragging his sheep along with him. Offerings of millet, cakes, and milk were then presented before Pales, marking the second segment of the ceremony. After these offerings, the shepherd would wet his hands with dew, face the east, and repeat a prayer four times. Such prayers requested Pales’s assistance in freeing the shepherd and the flock from evils brought about by accidental wrongdoings (e.g. trespassing on sacred grounds and removing water from a sacred water source). The final portion of the rural festival made use of the beverage burranica, a combination of milk and \"sapa\" (boiled wine). After consumption of this beverage, the shepherd would leap through the fire three times, bringing an end to the ceremony.\n\nThe urban form of the Parilia, on the other hand, is blended with other Roman religious practices and carried out by a priest. Ovid personally participated in this form and describes his experiences in the \"Fasti\". While the central actions of the rural ceremony carry over, the urban form adds two ingredients from other religious festivals: the Fordicidia and the October Horse. The Fordicidia sacrifices a pregnant cow to the deity Tellus to promote cattle and field fertility. The unborn calf is then removed from the womb and burnt. The October Horse is the right hand horse of the team that won a particular chariot race on October 15 of the previous year. Together, the ashes of the unborn calf and the blood from the head of the October Horse are mixed by the Vestals and are added to the burning bean straw of the bonfire. Dumézil questioned whether the \"Equus October\" provided the horse blood, since the two ancient sources that mention the ingredient omit identifying the victim.\n\nBy the end of the late Republic, the Parilia became associated with the birthday of Rome. Numerous accounts of the founding of Rome exist, but the particular one related to the Parilia is described by Ovid in his \"Fasti\". According to this myth, Romulus, upon reaching Rome on the day of the Parilia, took a stick and engraved a line in the ground that defined the boundaries of the new city \"(pomerium)\". He then prayed to the gods Jupiter, Mars, and Vesta asking for protection of this area. However, his brother Remus, unaware of the boundaries, crossed the line and was struck down by Romulus's henchman Celer. \n\nOver time, and under the influence of several Roman rulers, the structure of the Parilia changed. First, after Julius Caesar heard the news of Roman Victory at Munda in 45 BC (around the date of the Parilia), he added games to the ceremony. At these games, the citizens would wear crowns in Caesar’s honor. Caligula instituted into the celebration a procession of priests, noblemen, boys and girls of noble birth singing of his virtues while escorting the Golden Shield, previously bestowed upon him by the citizens of Rome, to the Capitol. At this time the Parilia became Rome's birthday celebration rather than the rural festival it had once been. In 121 AD Hadrian founded a new temple of Venus and Roma and changed the festival’s name to Romaea. The temple was ruined.\n"}

Because Barack Obama was reelected as President, the transition did not take place.\n\nThe transition plan was the first to occur under the terms of the 2010 Pre-election Presidential Transition Act.\n\nThe Edward \"Ted\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the Obama transition team.\n\nKnown internally as \"The Readiness Project\", transition planning began in April 2012, several months before the 2012 Republican National Convention. Led by Mike Leavitt, it consisted of a skeleton staff of four until August, when additional employees were retained. The staff eventually grew to almost 300 people. Other senior executives within the project included Robert Zoellick and Al Hubbard.\n\nActivities undertaken by the Readiness Project included preparing policy briefings for civil servants at federal agencies, which would be delivered by \"parachute teams\" following the election; creating a list of candidates to fill the several hundred political appointments made by the President; coordinating with the Obama administration for the transfer of occupancy of presidential residences, including the White House and the Number One Observatory Circle; liaising with the United States Armed Forces for the assumption of National Command Authority and launch control of nuclear weapons; and developing a post-election communications plan, which reportedly included a 1,000-word victory speech Romney would deliver. On the evening of the election, the Readiness Project's transition website, declaring Romney's victory, was accidentally pushed live, but was quickly taken down again. The site was built by a Utah-based web development company, SolutionStream.\n\nIn accordance with the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, the project was provided with office space by the General Services Administration (GSA) beginning in September 2012, two months prior to the election. The offices of the Readiness Project were shuttered and completely cleared within three days following Romney's defeat. Total spending by the Readiness Project between its inception and dissolution was $8.9 million, with those costs paid by the U.S. government.\n\nThe Romney team was reported as having shaken off the fear of appearing presumptuous, a fear that hampered the Obama team and hindered them from making adequate transition preparations.\n\nIn contrast with the Obama presidential transition, Leavitt communicated directly with White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew, and the two coordinated a plan, putting members of the transition team in charge of various government departments in direct communication with members of the Obama administration. Leavitt described his new style of transition team as \"essentially a federal government in miniature.\"\n\nThe Edward \"Ted\" Kaufman and Michael Leavitt Presidential Transitions Improvements Act of 2015 was named in Leavitt's honor and also in honor of the head of the Obama transition team. The organization said, \"The new law creates a federal overseer for the presidential transition and requires each agency to name a person to manage the process.\"\n\nLeavitt agreed to work on the planning for Donald Trump's presidential transition, even though he had not endorsed Trump. According to \"The Washington Post\", Leavitt is regarded as an \"evangelist for how to run an effective presidential transition.\" Leavitt stated that he was lending the Trump team his \"unique experience\" because \"[c]ountries are vulnerable during transitions and I see this as a very—almost obligation—to contribute to the country. This is a very serious thing.\"\n\nIn 2013, Leavitt published a 138-page case study of the Readiness Project entitled \"Romney Readiness Project 2012: Retrospectives and Lessons Learned\". In the foreword, Romney wrote, \"My campaign was not successful but our Readiness Project team was.\"\n\n\n"}

It, like Raksha Bandhan, celebrates the relationship between brothers and sisters. Rakhri means “to protect” whereby a brother promises to look out for his sister and in return, a sister prays for the well being of her brother. A Rakhri can also be tied on a cousin or an unrelated man. If a woman ties a Rakhri on an unrelated man, their relationship is treated as any other brother and sister relationship would be. The festival is a siblings-day comparable to Mother's day/Father's day/Grandparents day etc.\n\nA sister will tie the Rakhri on her brother and her brother will give a gift.

The competition selects young talents to compete in select auto events.\n\nThe event was launched late in the 1990 racing season. The Scholarship was set up with initial support from IndyCar Series team owner Rick Galles, gentleman racer and business owner Jonathan Holtzman and Ford Special Vehicle Operations.\n\nCanadian Formula Ford 2000 graduate Jimmy Vasser and USAC Sprint Car champion Jeff Gordon were selected to compete at the Formula Ford Festival. As Gordon had prior commitments in midget racing, so only Vasser made the trip to Brands Hatch. Vasser raced a Lanan 1604 chassis. The young American was involved in a crash with Steffan Nielsen in the heat race which ended is Festival. The following year the Scholarship again partnered with Lanan Racing, now racing a Reynard chassis. Herta qualified for the final race in 15th place and worked his way up to eleventh place. For 1992 two drivers were chosen to compete, Tony Ave and Ashton Lewis. The racers were selected after a test session at Snetterton. Primus Racing/John Village Automotive entered three Van Diemen RF92 chassis. Two were driven by Ave and Lewis, a third was driven by Geoff Boss as a guest driver. Boss was the fastest American driver qualifying fourth, but as his car did not pass technical inspection he had to start from the back of the grid. Lewis was the best Team USA Scholarship driver in the 1992 Formula Ford Festival finishing fifteenth. Boss was unable to advance after starting last in his heat race. Ave collided with John Oxborrow in his heat race and failed to finish. Jerry Nadeau was the sole driver selected for the Team USA Scholarship for 1993. The North Carolina native qualified on pole position for his heat race, winning the race in his year old Van Diemen RF92. He won the race with an advantage of over 26 seconds over Jan Neumann. AFter a second place in the semi-final race, Nadeau started the final in third. Racing with other young talents such as Craig Lowndes and Jan Erik Löfgren Nadeau had to settle for fourth place. Mike Borkwoski and Clay Collier were selected to race in the Formula Ford Festival Zetec class. The Festival was unsuccessful for both drivers with neither progressing into the final race.\n\nFor 1995 Team USA Scholarship had an agreement with Dick Bennetts, team owner of West Surrey Racing to field a Mugen-Honda powered Dallara F395 for a selected driver in the International Formula 3 Trophy. The race was run at Donington Park on 22 October 1995. Memo Gidley was selected and qualified the car in 16th position. Gidley finished the race in eleventh place after lengthy battles with Marc Cramer and Thomas Schwister. Owen McAuley won the race with Jason Elliott and Scott Lakin completing the podium.\n\nWith Formula 3 deemed to expensive, the Team USA Scholarship returned to more affordable racing. The EFDA Nations Cup was selected, being a one-make series all drivers raced equal material. The cars were Reynard Formula Opel Lotus single seaters. Tony Renna was selected out of six finalists. Jerry Nadeau racing in the 1996 Eruopean Formula Opel Lotus championship, joined Renna in the Nations Cup event. After two races the team placed second in the overall standings of the 1996 EFDA Nations Cup, scoring the silver medal.\n\nThe team returned to the Nations Cup in 1997 with Buddy Rice and Matt Sielsky. Paul Edwards was selected as a third driver, racing in the Formula Ford Festival. Edwards started fifth in the Festival race and worked his way up to third. Unfortunately, a run in with Robert Lechner caused Edwards to retire. In the Nations Cup Rice and Sielsky struggled in qualifying with the setup and the team had to settle for fifth.\n\nIn 1998 Team USA Scholarship supported Paul Edwards in the final three rounds of the Formula Opel Euroseries and the EFDA Formula Opel Lotus Winter Series. His best finish was a fifth place at the Nürburgring with a Team USA Scholarship supported Motaworld Racing entry. In the Winter Series Edwards raced with Team Meritus. Edwards won at Donington Park and placed second at the Hockenheimring. Leading the championship into the final round, again at the Hockenheimring, Edwards won the championship by default as the final was canceled. Freezing winter conditions caused the organisation to abandon the final event. Edwards won the championship over other contenders such as Richard Lyons and Takuma Sato.\n\nFor 1999 Team USA Scholarship shifted focus to the Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series. A series set up by former Formula 1 driver Jonathan Palmer featuring one-make Van Diemen chassis powered by 1.8L Audi engines. Three drivers were selected to compete, Paul Edwards, Andy Lally and Jeff Simmons were selected to compete. Edwards won three out of four races (at Snetterton and Brands Hatch), with Paul Munn winning the fourth race. Edwards won the championship with an 8-point advantage. Lally finished fifth, Simmons eighth.\n\nPhil Giebler and Joey Hand were selected for Team USA Scholarship for the 2000 Formula Palmer Audi Winter Series. Giebler scored three podiums and a win at Brands Hatch to claim the title. Hand scored a single podium finish, a second place at Snetterton, to settle for sixth in the championship.\n\nIn November 2001 twelve drivers were selected for a shootout style event at the Jim Russell Racing Driver School. A.J. Allmendinger and Bryan Sellers were selected for the 2001 Team USA Scholarship. Due to the relative inexperience with single seaters, Team USA Scholarship returned to Formula Ford, in New Zealand. The duo raced a partial season, with successes. Sellers won two races, both at Timaru, and placed ninth in the series championship. Sellers and Allmendinger placed second and third at the New Zealand Grand Prix, behind Fabian Coulthard. For 2003, three drivers were selected for the six race New Zealand International Formula Ford Series. Joe D'Agostino, Charlie Kimball and Ryan Millen. Millen, who is of New Zealand ancestry, is the nephew of 1980 New Zealand Grand Prix winner Steve Millen.\n\n State as listed on the Team USA Scholarship website.\n\n\n"}

It was first broadcast on the British television channel BBC2 on 17 January 1997. Written by Doug Naylor and directed by Ed Bye, it was the first episode not to involve co-creator and writer Rob Grant.\n\nSeries VII was the first series to have extended episodes.\n\nLister makes a video explaining how the crew survived their battle with their future selves. If the future crew had killed their former selves, they would have eliminated their own existence, and therefore not have been able to destroy themselves. (See temporal paradox.) Therefore, time has reset to a point before the crew picked up time drive. Lister's explanation is too convoluted for the video camera to handle and it explodes. Kryten dismisses the whole incident as \"garbled\" and more \"boring than an in-flight magazine produced by Air Belgium.\"\n\nUnfortunately disaster has struck - \"Starbug\" is still damaged from the battle and as a consequence all the Indian food supplies have been destroyed; not even a single papadum survived. Lister proposes that the crew obtain the time drive again and go back in time to an Indian take-away and order 500 curries (even though Out of Time established that travel to other places (such as Earth) would also require a star drive). Rimmer, Cat and Kryten are against the idea and oppose going back in time, having seen the kind of people they could possibly become. Lister argues that they can use a time drive and avoid that consequence if they don't abuse it like their future selves did; however he finds himself outnumbered and seemingly concedes defeat. However, Lister swaps Kryten's head for one of his spare heads and removes the guilt chip from it, having the now guiltless Kryten reassure the crew that it will be okay. The next morning, Rimmer and Cat are confused when Kryten serves them high-calorie breakfasts, starts smoking and using phrases like \"you bet your ass\". However, when Kryten assures them it'll be ok to pick up the time drive the two assent and board the ship containing it, intending to go back to the 21st Century to one of Lister's favourite curry houses to pick up a large order.\n\nTheir time travel calculations are a little off and they find themselves in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. They appear at the Texas School Book Depository just as Lee Harvey Oswald is firing at U.S. President John F. Kennedy. They inadvertently knock him out the window to his death below, thereby preventing Kennedy's assassination. The crew use the time travel device, to go three years forward to 1966.\n\nThe crew find Dallas deserted. Wandering the streets, they find a man who has been trampled to death, indicating people left in a hurry. Reading a nearby newspaper, Kryten finds out what has happened:\n\nThe crew attempt to correct the situation by returning to the day of the shooting and driving Oswald to a higher floor in the building, but this plan still fails to lead to Kennedy's death; by sending Oswald up another floor, they made the shot's trajectory so steep that Kennedy was merely wounded. Lister suggests getting a second gunman to shoot from behind a nearby grassy knoll. With none of the crew willing to shoot the President themselves, Lister travels to Idlewild Airport in 1965 and persuades a post-impeachment Kennedy to travel back to 1963, become a \"second gunman\" on the grassy knoll, and shoot himself to restore his place in history. The plan works: Kennedy shoots his past self and the timeline is restored. Kennedy grimly thanks the gang for the chance to restore himself to his proper place in history, and fades away as a result of the resetting timeline. Lister, too late, realises he forgot to ask Kennedy for the name of a good Indian take-away. Having seen that Lister has learned absolutely nothing from the experience, the other members of the crew give him a well-deserved beating in return for all he's put them through.\n\nShown as an option on the Series 7 DVD, the Extended Edition of \"Tikka To Ride\" continues after Cat, Rimmer and Kryten take out their frustrations on Lister. After managing to correctly use the time drive and steal the Indian food supplies from Starbug before the events of the episode began (thus showing an example of a predestination paradox and allowing Lister to re-stock on curry, papadums and lager), the crew end up storing the food in one of Starbug's cargo holds (ostensibly the same cargo hold it was stolen from in the first place - B-deck). Rimmer leaves with Kryten in tow but remarks as he does \"I must've passed this thing a million times. What the hell's it for?\" in regards to a lever by the door. It doesn't take long for Lister to give into the curiosity planted by Rimmer and pull the lever. The lever, in fact, activates the separation sequence for Starbug, jettisoning the rear section of the ship into space while allowing the front half to fly away; an ace Rimmer had \"had up his sleeve for months\". Lister notes that he's stranded alone in deep space with nothing but three-and-a-half tons of curry, and couldn't be happier before eagerly digging into the crates.\n\nEven though the previous series had ended on a cliffhanger, fans had been forced to wait three years for the resolution. This was due to a number of factors, which included Craig Charles being imprisoned before being cleared of a charge of rape, Chris Barrie making no secret of his desire to leave the show, and most notably Rob Grant deciding to leave the series, ending his and Doug Naylor's long-standing writing partnership. Naylor was left with the choice of either ending or continuing the series. Although tempted to end it, he later agreed to write two more eight-episode series of the show, as this would allow the episode count to reach 52 and therefore be eligible for syndication.\n\n\"Tikka To Ride\" ushered in new production values. The cinematic quality and filming of the new episodes meant that the studio audience was no longer viable (however the show was shown to an audience at a later date and their laughter was added). Also the special effects were increasing every series and the majority of the episodes were pre-recorded. One of Naylor's desires for a seventh series was the prospect of international syndication and a movie. This vision was helped with the return of Ed Bye to the director's chair, having previously left due to a scheduling clash with directing his wife Ruby Wax's new TV show at the time. He agreed to return to helm the seventh series, his first Red Dwarf episode since Series IV's \"Meltdown\".\n\nThe arrival of the seventh series was also promoted by the show making its first appearance of the front cover of the Radio Times.\n\nGuest stars included Michael J. Shannon who played John F. Kennedy, Toby Aspin as Lee Harvey Oswald, Peter Gaitens as FBI Agent and Robert Ashe as Cop.\n\nThe deserted Dallas scenes were filmed at Farnborough Airport. The expanded Starbug cargo deck scenes were filmed inside the former Royal Aircraft Establishment wind tunnels at Farnborough. The motorcade scenes were filmed at the Chobham test track, with additional crowd shots filmed around buildings at Shepperton Studios.\n\nThe title of this episode is a piece of word-play based on the name of the song \"Ticket to Ride\" by the Beatles, in accordance with the theme of curry on which the storyline focuses, tikka being an Indian spice marinade.\n\nWhen on the Grassy Knoll, Lister, Rimmer and Cat are dressed up as tramps, an outfit which the normally vain and shallow Cat would not be seen dead in: \"Superficial is my middle name\". This was based on the Three tramps, men that are reported to have been found in a boxcar behind the Grassy Knoll when the police searched it after the shooting, but were later released. Conspiracy theorists have assumed that they were part of the assassination plot.\n\nThe concept of the crew travelling backwards in time and accidentally saving someone's life, leading to a change for the worse in history, was also used in the \"Star Trek\" episode \"The City on the Edge of Forever\". In each case the person saved was actually an advocate of peace; however, there were few other similarities between the episodes.\n\nIn the commentary for the Series III episode \"Timeslides\" when talking about Kryten's shouting \"Duck!\" at the Grassy Knoll line, they note how their characters actually did something similar later on.\n\nAt the start of the episode, Lister explains that the crew survived the previous cliffhanger because of a temporal paradox, which made it impossible for them to be killed by their future selves. However, later in the same episode, Kennedy is able to kill his younger self without creating the same paradox. There is no explanation of why there is one rule for the crew of Starbug and another for Kennedy. Similarly, it is explained that by preventing the initial assassination, Russia wins the space race (this is why Starbug disappears). This means the JMC never exists and the time drive would never have been found in the first place.\n\nIn the previous episode it was made clear that the time drive was only a \"time\" drive and not a space and time drive, so the crew could travel forward or backward in time but were still stuck in deep space. It was not explained in the episode how the time drive can suddenly transport them through space, or why, given that they could travel to 1963 Earth, they did not simply travel back to 22nd Century Earth as per their original plan.\n\nOn the Red Dwarf VII DVD documentary \"Back from the Dead\", director Ed Bye recalled explaining to a fan that the time drive was made up, and was just a lump of plastic.\n\n\"Tikka to Ride\" has generally been well received by critics. DVDActive called it \"a promising start to the series\" and noted that it was \"beautifully shot, with a movie-style score\". DVD Verdict stated \"what other sitcom, sci-fi or otherwise, would take on the Kennedy Assassination and an alternative future for the United States had the beloved President not been felled by a rain of bullets?\" and concluded that the episode \"was majestic\". Sci-Fi Online noted that \"\"Tikka to Ride\" morphs into a surprisingly serious time paradox\" but felt that the final plot twist was \"a largely pointless contrivance.\" BellaOnline called the episode \"pure silliness, and I mean of the kind that makes \"Red Dwarf\" great.\"\n\n"}

It was organized by ID&T and was held since 1999 in various venues in the Netherlands.\n\nFounded in 1999. Traditionally, there was a \"small\" edition and a big edition each year. In 2002, the small edition failed to sell out its 20,000-person ticket capacity (only 15,000 tickets were sold) and thereafter, Trance Energy was only held once annually, at the Jaarbeurs convention center in Utrecht, Netherlands, where it has been sold out each year up to 2009. The festival gained \"cult\" status among Trance fans. In 2010, it failed to sell out by slight margins since it was organized on Easter week end and this was problematic for some foreign visitors (especially from Poland).\n\nIn 2011 ID&T changed the concept and renamed the festival to \"Energy the network\", opening the festival to other genres from Trance only. The change was announced in September 2010, and labelled as a simple \"name change\". This change caused controversy and was very negatively greeted on internet forums. Meanwhile, one ID&T competitor launched a Trance only festival in the Netherlands. As a result, attendance declined steadily with edition 2011 and 2012 being not sold out by large margins. (Only half of 2012 tickets were sold). In 2013, the event was moved to the Ziggo Dome, a smaller venue in Amsterdam and still it failed to sell out. There has been no announcement of a 2014 edition up to this date. Yet ID&T has not announced cancellation of the event like they usually do.\n\nWhile audience in the first years was mostly Dutch, there were subsequently many international visitors, mainly from the European Union but sometimes from other areas around the world. This is due to the festival earning worldwide fame thanks to bootlegs of DJ mixes and some official videos of former editions. At the 2010 edition, it has been quoted by ID&T that more than 40% of the audience was not Dutch.\n\nIn 2017, ID&T announced the return of Trance Energy. The brand will be hosting a stage at Tomorrowland. The return of the festival itself, looks likely.\n\nPast 2003 editions of Trance Energy usually focus on three stages located in different halls of the Jaarbeurs convention center and connected by corridors :\n\n\nSince 2007, a fourth stage has been added, the \"Hard Stage\" featuring harder derivatives of Trance Music.\nIn 2009, students of the Utrecht School for the Arts were asked to design the entrance of the festival. They created a multi-disciplinary entrance, where interactivity, game-elements, video, fashion and music came together.\n\nTrance Energy toured Australia in 2009. The tour attracted controversy after police shut down the Melbourne leg early due to 26 overdoses.\n\nHere is the list of Trance Energy editions :\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9234276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9234276", "title": "UFO sightings in Canada", "text": "UFO sightings in Canada\n\nBelow is a partial list of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects or UFOs in Canada.\n\nOn June 18, 1960, a prospector told the Yellowknife RCMP detachment that a month earlier, he and his partner saw a UFO at Clan Lake, located 30 miles north of Yellowknife. According to UFOlogist Chris Rutkowski, the men claimed they saw a hovering object 4 to 6 feet wide that hit the surface of the lake. The RCMP investigated, but found nothing.\n\nStefan Michalak claimed he was burned by one of two flying saucers with which he reportedly came into contact on May 19, 1967 near Falcon Lake (Manitoba). Ufologists claim that images of Michalak in the hospital show a grid of burn marks on his chest, and a similar grid appears burned into his t-shirt. Ufologists consider it to be one of the most documented UFO stories in Canada.\n\nTwo books have been written on the alleged Falcon Lake occurrence:\n\n\nSkeptic Dr. Aaron Sakulich reviewed the report made by Michalak to police shortly after the incident, along with other evidence, and concluded that Michalak was indeed burned but that the burns were in fact likely caused by an accident brought on by alcohol consumption, and that Michalak, who was prospecting for silver ore near the lake at the time, probably made the story up to keep other prospectors out of the area.\n\nIn April 2018, the Royal Canadian Mint released a $20 silver coin depicting the alleged event as part of its Canada's Unexplained Phenomena series, stating \"According to Stefan Michalak’s account, two glowing objects descended from the sky on May 20, 1967, near Falcon Lake, Manitoba, where one landed close enough for him to approach. When the craft suddenly took flight, its emission set Michalak’s clothes ablaze, leaving him with mysterious burns… and an unusual tale to tell.\"\n\nThe incident was the purported crash of an Unidentified Flying Object in Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia in October 1967.\n\nIn Prince George, British Columbia, three unrelated witnesses reported a strange, round object in the late afternoon sky on January 1, 1969. The sphere radiated a yellow-orange light and appeared to ascend from 2,000 to 10,000 feet.\n\nSeveral sightings were reported of a red glowing UFO, sometimes described as \"mischievous\" or \"playful\", sighted in Southern Manitoba in 1975 and 1976.\n\nIn October 1978, Constable Jim Blackwood of the RCMP witnessed a sighting of a flying saucer hovering over the harbour near the town of Clarenville and Random Island. This was reported to him by local citizens. When he arrived at the scene the UFO was still present and quite visible. He had a special high powered viewing scope which happened to be on loan at the time for other surveillance. The craft stayed in the area for approximately an hour and a half. When he switched on the roof lights of his police cruiser the craft appeared to mimic the flashing lights. This made headline news at the time and was broadcast on CBC television and NTV broadcasting in Newfoundland. The craft took off like a shooting star high in the sky and disappeared. Two years after the incident the BBC did a documentary on UFO sightings and included the Clarenville sighting in their broadcast. In later years Cst Blackwood retired to his native home in Stellarton, Nova Scotia.\n\nIn the early evening of January 20, 1986 a couple travelling by car on a rural road in Cape Breton, NS witnessed a bright light appear and hover directly over their car. Almost immediately their vehicle lost power. After watching the blinding light for less than a minute, they watched it quickly accelerate away from them, lighting up the ground below the object as it departed.\n\nOn November 20 at 5.30 p.m., in Sainte-Marie-de-Monnoir (a rural neighbourhood of Marieville) several people heard a noise similar to an electric generator and saw some strange lights in the sky. Two days after the phenomenon a perfect round circle was found outside the residence of Mr Jean Prigent, one of the witnesses of the sighting.\n\nOn November 7, 1990, in Montreal, Quebec, witnesses reported a round, metallic object of about 540 metres wide over the rooftop pool of the Bonaventure Hotel. Eyewitnesses saw 8 to 10 lights forming into a circle above them, emitting bright white rays. The phenomenon lasted three hours, from 7 to 10 p.m., and moved slowly northwards. While none could identify the lights, a few witnesses, according to the next day’s report in La Presse, were ready to express their belief that they were visited by aliens.\nA few witnesses say what they saw in a televised interview on CBC.\n\nA UFO was photographed in Ajax, Ontario.\n\nDuring the night of January 25, 2010 there were multiple UFO sighting reports in Harbour Mille, Newfoundland and Labrador. Royal Canadian Mounted Police initially stated the reports were due to a missile launch, but later retracted the statement, and the Office of the Prime Minister stated that the UFOS were not missiles. Another minor report of this incident came from Calgary where boys playing hockey reported seeing similar objects, about which they stated \"We thought they were Transformers\"\n\nWhile putting out a bonfire late in the evening of June 4, 2014, John Sheppard witnessed unusual lights in the sky over the Gulf of St. Lawrence and captured 22 minutes of it on his cellphone. After reporting the incident to MUFON and their investigation concluding it being a confirmed sighting, CBC covered the event. The next day, CBC released a follow-up article in which a series of alternate explanations for the event were presented.\n\nThere were multiple reports of a UFO activity above Toronto in the last week of July 2014.\n\nAccording to the 2002 Canadian UFO Survey published by Ufology Research of Manitoba, Toronto had the largest number of sightings with 34, followed by Vancouver with 31 and Terrace, B.C. with 25 reports. In 2002, a typical UFO sighting lasted approximately 15 minutes.\nThe Canadian Federal Government currently (2007) directs all UFO sightings to \"Chris Rutkowski\" of Ufology Research of Manitoba.\n\nOn July 15, 2018, a Canadian news site mentioned a new study conducted by Ufology Research, formerly known as Ufology Research of Manitoba, stating there have been more than 1,000 UFO sightings reported in Canada in 2017.\n\n \n \n\n\n"}
{"id": "49816554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49816554", "title": "Yoyo A Go Go", "text": "Yoyo A Go Go\n\nYoyo A Go Go, usually abbreviated to Yoyo and often typeset in various ways, was an independent music festival in Olympia, Washington, first held in 1994 and followed by successor festivals in 1997, 1999, and 2001. Five- and six-day concert marathons featured dozens of punk and indie rock acts stacked back to back, as well as a variety of associated entertainment and small-scale local retail. The concerts took place at the historic Capitol Theater and showcased performers from the local Olympia music scene, while also including national and international artists.\n\nThe first Yoyo enterprise was a recording studio built inside Olympia's Capitol Theater by audio engineer Pat Maley. By 1992, Maley had formed the Yoyo record label and released the compilation \"\" (reissued on CD in 2001) which included tracks by area musicians. Maley eventually decided to initiate an independent musical event, inspired by Olympia's earlier International Pop Underground Convention (IPU), a highly regarded 1991 festival that has been deemed \"a watershed moment in indie rock\".\n\nA musician himself, Maley organized the festival with help from drummer Kent Oiwa, graphic designer Pat Castaldo, and local disc jockey Michelle Noel. The guiding principle was the DIY ethic central to punk rock. In a press release for the festival, Maley declared: \"Long ago, punk rock stopped being simply a noun that was young, loud, and proud. Now it's also a descriptive term that tries to explain the difference between the buy in/sell out culture that wakes us up every morning for work, and the culture so many of us make every day with our own hands\".\n\nThe Yoyo festivals ran concurrently with another citywide event, the annual Lakefair festival. Yoyo organizers felt little sense of competition, and were inclined to believe Lakefair, with its more traditional style of fireworks and parade, would be a complementary affair and \"add to the overall sense of fun\". From the first festival, audience members and performers marched together as a contingent (\"The Throw Team\") in the Lakefair Parade.\n\nThe crush of performances squeezed into five- or six-day festivals meant most shows were limited to about thirty minutes. For this reason, some observers criticized Yoyo for a lack of focus: \"The breadth of musical styles – and musical abilities – works against appreciating any one band\". Candice Pedersen, co-owner of K Records and another key Yoyo organizer, explained that the point of the festival was not to maximize publicity or sales, but to share and enjoy a communal endeavor: \"[S]ee all the bands, have a good time, meet a lot of people, and treat each other well\". The mutual support among artists and audience was seen by many as a hallmark of the Olympia music scene and one of the keys to its growth and endurance.\n\nContinuing the IPU's efforts at scene-building, Yoyo attracted participants for whom stage-sharing was acceptable and professional competition was virtually unknown. For its polite performers – and the rapt audiences who lavished attention on them – Yoyo has been called \"the friendliest punk fest\", a trait which earned it one magazine's gentle chiding as a \"punk rock slumber party\".\n\nAnother emblematic feature of Yoyo was the ubiquity of female musicians. All-female bands (or female-led ones) were commonplace, even more so than at the IPU in 1991. The IPU had heralded the advent of the riot grrrl movement with opening night festivities billed as \"Girl Night\", but Yoyo festivals cemented this as a feature of the Olympia scene: female bands were \"a given, not a special attraction\". Though its musical styles were far-flung, the Olympia community that populated Yoyo was most often linked to twee pop and cuddlecore.\n\nAs described in \"SPIN\", \"the first Yoyo blossomed in the damp heat that followed Seattle's grunge explosion.\" The Olympia scene was riding a wave of interest from major media who were giving close scrutiny to the Pacific Northwest in the wake of Nirvana's international success. The first Yoyo festival was a five-day affair, July 12–16, 1994.\n\nDozens of independent bands played at Yoyo 1994 including Beck, Bikini Kill, Heavens to Betsy, Mary Lou Lord, Team Dresch, Lois, Go Sailor, the Spinanes, Mecca Normal, Some Velvet Sidewalk, the Halo Benders, Neutral Milk Hotel, Unwound, and Tattle Tale. Avant-garde rockers Deerhoof played one of their first shows at the festival, and were quickly signed to record a single for Kill Rock Stars. Several visiting Japanese bands were also part of the bill, including Bloodthirsty Butchers. The roster was publicized as a mixture of bands from \"around the corner and around the world.\"\n\nMaking an unscheduled appearance were Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl, in their first public performance together since the death of Kurt Cobain in April. The pair played a set with the Stinky Puffs, led by ten-year-old Simon Timony, and joined by Ira Kaplan (of Yo La Tengo) and Jad Fair. A solemn moment for the festival came when Timony offered a memorial song he wrote for Cobain: \"'You rode off into the sun / but I love you anyway,' he sang in a preteen falsetto, while Novoselic towered behind him, playing stone-faced.\"\n\nA double album containing almost two hours of live performances, \"Yo-Yo A Go-Go\", was released by Yoyo on August 20, 1996.\n\n\"The continued presence of kitty-cat iconography and strummy guitar lullabies at Yoyo 1997 suggests a wistful nostalgia for Olympia's original love-rock days\". Over fifty bands played, including once again several visiting Japanese bands such as Copass Grinders and Kirihito. Headliners included Sleater-Kinney, Modest Mouse, Karp, Unwound, Mirah, Cold Cold Hearts, Murder City Devils, The Softies, The Crabs, and Built to Spill.\n\nAmong the varied entertainment was an \"a cappella\" performance piece by artist Nikki McClure; a puppeteers' rendition of \"The Gong Show\"; a string quartet conducted by composer Timothy Brock; a ukulele recital by Khaela Maricich; and an outdoor nature walk designed specifically for punks. Festival attendees were also treated to special movie screenings offered by the Olympia Film Society and an afternoon show by the campy, all-female troupe Cha Cha Cabaret, led by riot grrrl activist Jen Smith (under the stage name \"Lady Hand Grenade\").\n\nA compilation of live recordings from the 1997 festival was released on Yoyo Recordings in 1999 under the title \"Yoyo A Go Go – Another Live Compilation – July 15–20, 1997\".\n\nThe 1999 festival was held July 13–18, and featured musical performances by Sleater-Kinney and Elliott Smith. Negativland appeared at the festival and played their first live set in six years, while Bratmobile arrived as part of a reunion tour, having broken up several years earlier. In total, over fifty bands played over the six-day event, including The Make-Up, Dub Narcotic Sound System, The Donnas, Quasi, Tullycraft, Dead Moon, Marine Research, Thrones, Bonfire Madigan, and Mecca Normal.\n\nPearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder made a guest appearance with C Average and took part in their costumed tribute set to The Who. Elliott Smith played the festival's final set, and his celebrated performance was released on DVD in 2004.\n\nThe live album, \"Yoyo A GoGo 1999\", was released in 2001. The album features twenty live tracks by festival performers, followed by a zestful five-minute recording of Negativland leading the crowd in a recitation of Casey Kasem's notorious and profanity-streaked diatribe: \"This all means diddly-shit! Who gives a shit . . . diddly-shit! This is American Top 40 bullshit!\". The CD's communal finale has been described as the \"collective Yoyo a Go Go 'fuck-you' to the mainstream recording industry and corporate radio\".\n\nThe fourth Yoyo festival was held July 17–22, 2001, and once again included over fifty musical acts, as well as spoken word performances, art shows and seminars. Headlining participants included Bratmobile, The Need, The Gossip, C Average, Dead Moon, and Sarah Dougher. Also appearing were Erase Errata, the Evaporators, Mark Robinson, the Microphones, the Mountain Goats, The Cannanes, Tracy and the Plastics, Mecca Normal, and the Selby Tigers.\n\nYoyo festivals were always inclusive of the LGBT community, and since the original 1994 event always proudly sported a \"solid queer presence\". In its tradition, a later series of annual festivals dedicated to queercore began in Olympia in 2002 under the name \"Homo-A-Go-Go\".\n\nFilmmakers Elina Shatkin, Cris Dupont, and Thomas Logoreci collaborated on a documentary about the 1999 and 2001 festivals, \"Try This At Home\", which was released in 2015. Yoyo and its participating artists are prominent features of \"A Revolution You Can Dance To: Indie Music in the Northwest\", an exhibition (2016–2017) at the Washington State History Museum.\n\n"}
