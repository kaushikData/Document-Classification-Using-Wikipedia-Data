{"id": "3224179", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3224179", "title": "34th World Science Fiction Convention", "text": "34th World Science Fiction Convention\n\nThe 34th World Science Fiction Convention carried the official name MidAmeriCon (abbreviated as MAC) and was held September 2–6, 1976, in Kansas City, Missouri, United States, at the Radisson Muehlebach Hotel and nearby Phillips House hotel. The convention committee was chaired by Ken Keller, who had also chaired the \"KC in '76\" bid. There were 4200 registered members of the convention, of which 3014 actually attended.\n\nThe professional Guest of Honor at the 34th Worldcon was former Kansas Citian Robert A. Heinlein. He did not prepare a formal guest of honor speech, as such, but gave a generally well received one, immediately following the convention's Hugo Awards ceremony at the nearby Art Deco-inspired Music Hall section of the Kansas City Municipal Auditorium. Heinlein came with an alarm clock and put it on his center stage podium and spoke casually until his own preset time period ended with the alarm going off. Heinlein was previously the Guest of Honor at the 3rd Worldcon (1941) and the 19th Worldcon (1961). He remains the only science fiction writer honored three times by the annual World Science Fiction Convention. Heinlein attended many MidAmeriCon events, including a blood donation drive and later donor reception held at the nearby Hotel Continental, one of the Worldcon's overflow hotels. Being someone with a very rare blood type, Heinlein had organized the blood drive and reception to honor those anonymous donors who had donated blood, saving lives during surgeries, including his own earlier in the decade.\n\nLongtime fan artist George Barr was the convention's Fan Guest of Honor. He created the convention's official black-and-white logo artwork and painted the full-color wrap-around dust jacket artwork used on the convention's hardcover program book. His hardcover art book, \"Upon the Winds of Yesterday\" from Donald F. Grant, Publisher, made its debut at MidAmeriCon.\n\nWell known, long time fan and fan writer and professional science fiction and mystery writer Wilson Tucker (aka Bob Tucker) served as the convention's Toastmaster.\n\nListed in the MidAmeriCon pocket program was \"The Star Wars Display\" in Muehlebach Towers meeting room 364 (aka The Chapel). Charles Lippincott, Star Wars Corporation's vice-president of advertising, publicity, promotion, and merchandising, producer Gary Kurtz, and actor Mark Hamill were on hand promoting the upcoming George Lucas film, that would be released 9 months later in May 1977. At that point, the space fantasy was being called \"The Star Wars\" (\"Star Wars\"). Three of the film's costumes were displayed on mannequins: Darth Vader and the C-3PO and R2-D2 robots; also on display was Darth Vader's lightsaber (hanging from his belt) and a Storm Trooper helmet and blaster, behind-the-scenes production 8x10 stills, and a wall of framed conceptual artwork by Ralph McQuarrie. As a part of the studio's promotion of the film, an offset-printed, two-page yellow press release flyer was given away in the display room; it depicted an early graphic of the Luke Skywalker character drawn by McQuarrie. A dark blue, 2.25-inch wide promotional button, emblazoned in white type with the motto \"May the Force Be With You\", and a largish, full-color film poster drawn by Howard Chaykin, were also made available. The display proved so popular that all three promotional items were gone by the end of the second day of the display.\n\nAt 1:30 pm, on Saturday afternoon September 4, 1976, an hour-long presentation made up of 35mm slides of the film's production artwork and on-set production photos was narrated live in the Muehlebach's Imperial Ballroom, the hotel's largest, to a standing-room-only crowd; this was presented by The Star Wars Corporation's Charles Lippincott. During the course of the presentation, he outlined in great detail the plot of the film from scene one through to the final scene. A lengthy audience question-and-answer period followed with Lippincott, producer Kurtz, and star Hamill.\n\nThe \"electronic tonalities\" soundtrack for the classic MGM science fiction film \"Forbidden Planet\" was first released in 1976 by Louis and Bebe Barron at MidAmeriCon. It was on a vinyl LP album, done for the film's 20th anniversary, on the Barron's own PLANET Records label (later changed to SMALL PLANET Records and distributed by GNP Crescendo Records). The LP was premiered at the convention by the Barrons as part of a 20th Anniversary celebration of the film being held at MidAmeriCon. They helped the convention's film programming staff arrange for the rental of fine grain print of the film from MGM's archival storage vaults. Three separate screenings of \"Forbidden Planet\" were held as part of the convention's all 35mm science fiction and fantasy film retrospective. The Barrons were on-hand to promote their signed soundtrack LP, and they introduced the first of the three screenings of the film.\n\nFor MidAmeriCon, science fiction and fantasy author George R. R. Martin, along with his good friend Gardner Dozois, organized the first-ever Hugo Losers Party. They first gathered together all the leftover but previously unfinished and opened bottles of wine and liquor, and all unopened beer, and all left-over snack foods from Sunday evening's many open room parties. This was for a uniquely themed \"dead dog\" party: It was to be a gathering spot for all past Hugo losers (and friends and family), set to happen Monday evening after the \"official\" closing ceremonies for MidAmeriCon that afternoon. Martin and Dozois had planned to host this open party should Martin lose either Hugo for which he had been nominated. He became the party's undisputed host when he lost in \"both\" MidAmeriCon Hugo Awards categories: for the Novelette \"...and Seven Times Never Kill Man\" and the novella \"The Storms of Windhaven\", written with Lisa Tuttle.\n\nWhenever a past or current Hugo loser entered, Martin, standing atop his three-drawer-high room dresser, would take a swig directly from a liquor bottle, and in a loud voice announce, \"Looooose,\" as his other arm, held on high, made a wide, sweeping downward arc, all to the delight of the assembled party goers. A little later at the party, writer Larry Niven was presented with a \"replacement\" Hugo Award by convention chairman Ken Keller. As Niven entered, from atop his dresser, Martin announced in a well-lubricated voice, \"There's another loser, he \"broke\" his new Hugo\". Niven had dropped and broken the award in a backstage stairwell shortly after winning it while rushing back to his auditorium seat. Niven quickly departed after receiving a loud round of good natured boos and catcalls in response to Keller's presentation. In the years and decades that followed, the Hugo Losers Party became an annual event and evolved into one of the largest social gatherings held annually at every Worldcon.\n\nThe convention also produced another first: a highly collectible hardcover 172 page program and souvenir book, edited and designed by Tom Reamy. The book contained articles, essays, an artists' portfolio illustrating scenes from the novels of Guest of Honor Robert A. Heinlein, fiction by Harlan Ellison and Howard Waldrop, as well as convention-related items like guest biographies, detailed film program notes, a membership list, and paid advertising. Only two other hardcovers have subsequently been done, one by the 45th World Science Fiction Convention and one by the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention.\n\nAt MidAmeriCon, the 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards, the Hugos, were held for the very first time as a stand-alone, separate event and not given out during a traditional combined guests of honor speeches and awards banquet in the Radisson Muehlebach Hotel. Instead, Sunday evening of the convention, they were presented in the nearby 2600-seat Music Hall of Kansas City's Art Deco Municipal Auditorium complex, in keeping with MidAmeriCon's theme, \"Science Fiction and the Arts\". \nAs convention members entered the Art Deco opulence of the Music Hall to take their seats, they were greeted by a variety of popular 1930's show tunes playing from the auditorium's speakers. The house lights slowly fading to black, announced the start of the ceremony. Multiple super trooper spotlights began quickly panning the curtained stage area, just as Benny Goodman's original up-tempo show tune \"Hoorah for Hollywood\" began playing from the speakers. As the tune ended, the spotlights abruptly stopped, just as The Music Hall's house lights slowly began to come up. Max Steiner's dramatic \"Overture\" from his score to the 1932 fantasy film \"King Kong\" began playing, just as the stage's seven sets of vertical and horizontal drapery were set in motion. The black grand drape opened slowly, revealing six colored vertical and horizontal drapes, opening one after the other, in sync to the movements of one minute and 30 second Steiner composition. While the score was still playing, the stage became fully exposed and MidAmeriCon's logo was projected onto a cyclorama backdrop: \"MidAmeriCon Presents (slide dissolve) The 22nd Annual Science Fiction Achievement Awards (slide dissolve) The Hugos\", and the rousing Steiner composition ended. From offstage, a voice-over by Kansas City actor David Wilson, intoned \"King Kong\" dialog, \"\"He was a King and a God in the world he knew\" (slight pause), but we've tamed and brought him here for you tonight' (slight pause). Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the 8th Wonder of the Science Fiction World, Mr. Bob Tucker\". After the applause died down, toastmaster Bob Tucker began his opening remarks, some humorous, and made several quick announcements. The Hugo Awards were then presented.\n\nBob was assisted on stage throughout the ceremony by MAC committee member Pat Cadigan and Hugo Awards sub-committee member India Boone. They brought the nominee envelopes and Hugo Awards from back stage as Bob Tucker announced the recipients, who came on stage from a special nominee's seating area at the front of the Music Hall.\n\nGuest of Honor Robert A. Heinlein's delivered his guest of honor address immediately following the Hugo Awards presentation.\n\nMidAmeriCon also presented another Worldcon first, a \"themed\" base used for the Hugo Award: \"The Dragon and the Rocket\". Instead of being made out of finished wood in square or angled stacked shapes, as in the past, all bases were cast from flexible molds using a marbled effect achieved by combining contrasting tinted porcelain powder layers with resin and a hardener. When cured, a low-luster clear outer finish was then applied. Each example featured a sculpted, just-hatched dragon (representing the fantasy genre) wrapped half-way around each \"round\" 4.5\" tall base. The traditional 13\" tall, four-finned Hugo rocket (representing science fiction) was John Millard's newer 1973 design; a dozen examples had been machined from billet aluminum stock and then finished with an overall semi-gloss clear outer coat. The flat top of each base had a 4-inch diameter, quarter-inch thick, sand-blasted aluminum \"transition\" disk that each rocket sat upon. The rocket and disc where then friction tightened to the base through its center using a long threaded bolt and nut; each base's round, flat bottom was then covered with adhesive-backed black felt to hide the recessed attachment point. A curved black-and-silver engraved Hugo information plate was affixed by two screws to the base's side facing away from the wrapped dragon. The overall base design was by convention chairman Ken Keller, with the final finished design and casting master sculpted by three-time Hugo Award-winning fan artist Tim Kirk (who went on to win his fourth Hugo in the same category that year).\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2145417", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2145417", "title": "A New Brain", "text": "A New Brain\n\nA New Brain is a musical with music and lyrics by William Finn and book by Finn and James Lapine. Though many of Finn's previous musicals were to some extent autobiographical, \"A New Brain\" dealt directly with his own harrowing experience with an arteriovenous malformation and the healing power of art. The hero of the musical, Gordon Schwinn, worries that he may not live to complete his work. Finn wrote many of the songs soon after his release from the hospital. The musical premiered Off-Broadway in 1998 and has been revived in the U.S., England and elsewhere.\n\n\"A New Brain\" started as a \"series of songs that Bill Finn wrote after he left the hospital\", with a concert of those songs produced at The Public Theater. A fully staged workshop production was held in 1996 and again in 1997 and included contributions by Lapine.\n\nThe musical was first produced Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center, with previews beginning on May 14, 1998, and closed on October 11, 1998. The production was directed by Graciela Daniele and featured a cast headed by Malcolm Gets (Gordon Michael Schwinn) and Christopher Innvar (Roger Delli-Bovi), including Michael Mandell (Richard), Penny Fuller (Mimi Schwinn), Mary Testa (Lisa), Kristin Chenoweth (Waitress/Nancy D), Chip Zien (Mr. Bungee), Liz Larsen (Rhoda), John Jellison (Doctor), and Keith Byron Kirk (Minister). Lovette George was an understudy for Rhoda, Waitress, and Nancy D. Christopher Innvar left the show in June 1998 due to vocal problems, and Norm Lewis was to sing the role of Roger on the recording.\n\nA cast recording was made under the RCA Victor label with Norm Lewis singing the role of Roger.\n\n\"A New Brain\" was next performed at Rice University during the Sid Richardson Players' 1999-2000 season. It was also done at UC Berkeley BareStage during the 2000-2001 season, which transferred to Shotgun Players in 2001. The show was also produced in March 2002 in St. Louis, Missouri, at New Line Theatre, then premiered in the UK at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2005, with the English premiere in September 2006 in Littlehampton, West Sussex.\n\nThe musical was presented as part of the Encores! Off-Center staged concert series June 24–27, 2015 at the New York City Center. The production included multiple rewrites by Finn and Lapine and was directed by Lapine. It starred Jonathan Groff as Gordon and featured Dan Fogler as Mr. Bungee, Ana Gasteyer as Mimi, and Aaron Lazar as Roger.\n\nA new, updated cast recording has been recorded by the cast of the Encores! Off-Center production (with the exception of Fogler, who was filming a movie in London at the time of the recording and was replaced by Christian Borle as Mr. Bungee) and was released February 5, 2016, by PS Classics. Unlike the original recording, this two-disc set contains the full show, including over 15 minutes of previously unrecorded music.\nLisa, a homeless woman, asks the audience for some change. Songwriter Gordon Schwinn works at his piano to meet a deadline, irritated because he must write a song about spring for children's television host Mr. Bungee, who dresses as a frog (\"Frogs Have So Much Spring (The Spring Song)\"). Gordon takes a break from writing The Spring Song to meet his best friend Rhoda at a restaurant, where the waitress, who is a fan of Mr. Bungee, informs Gordon and Rhoda of the specials at the restaurant, including (\"Calamari\"). During lunch, he clutches his head and falls face first into his meal. Rhoda calls an ambulance (\"911 Emergency\") and Gordon is taken to the hospital. Gordon's greatest fear is dying with his greatest songs still inside him (\"I Have so Many Songs\"), to which he ponders about what makes a song (“Heart and Music”). Gordon's mother, Mimi, arrives and insists that (\"Mother's Gonna Make Things Fine\"). A neurosurgeon, Dr. Jafar Berensteiner, explains that there's (\"Trouble in His Brain\") and that an MRI is necessary.\n\nGordon snaps at Mimi for underestimating his condition and not listening to the Doctor, to which a hallucination of Mr. Bungee appears, telling Gordon to (\"Be Polite To Everyone\"), and Gordon tells it to leave. Gordon daydreams about his boyfriend Roger, who is on his way to the hospital from a (\"Sailing\") trip. The nurses, sadistic Nancy D. and compassionate Richard, are introduced. Nancy D. requests a (\"Family History\"), prompting Gordon to ponder why he only inherited the bad traits from his parents (\"Gordon's Law of Genetics\"). He reflects on his father's abandonment (\"And They're Off\"). (\"Roger Arrives\") and spends some time with Gordon, who tells him to (\"Just Go\"). Richard enters to give Gordon a sponge bath in preparation for his (“MRI Tomorrow”). During the sponge bath, Richard complains that he is (\"Poor, Unsuccessful and Fat\"). Gordon hallucinates and sees Mr. Bungee who continually bullies him. Gordon is visited by a minister, who tries to inflict his Protestant beliefs on Gordon, who is Jewish. Gordon asks him to leave, and goes to sleep.\n\nGordon is woken by Nancy, who informs him that it’s (“MRI Day”). To cope with his claustrophobia, he thinks about a past sailing trip with Roger (\"Sitting Becalmed in the Lee of Cuttyhunk\"). Dr. Berensteiner tells Gordon that he has an arteriovenous malformation, and needs a (\"Craniotomy\"). Nancy D. informs him of the risks - if he doesn't go through with the operation, he could die, however, if Dr. Berensteiner is not exact with his surgery, he could also die. Gordon, given the choice by the Doctor, decides to go through with the operation, and Roger offers to sleep with Gordon that night (\"An Invitation to Sleep In My Arms\"). Rhoda arrives with news that Mr. Bungee needs a new song by the next morning, so Gordon declines Roger's offer and decides to write instead. He then hallucinates about Lisa, who he encountered earlier on his way to lunch with Rhoda. Lisa implores the audience for (\"Change\"), both physical money and social change. Gordon presents his new song, (\"Yes\"), to Mr. Bungee, who hates it, storming off to leave Gordon dejected (\"In the Middle of the Room\"). Mimi cleans Gordon's apartment, and in a rage, throws out all of his books (\"Throw It Out\"). Gordon waits anxiously as his surgery is delayed (\"In the Middle of the Room (Part 2)\"). Then the operation commences. \n\nRoger, distraught about the surgery, encounters Lisa who consoles him (\"A Really Lousy Day in the Universe\"). In a coma, Gordon hallucinates a surrealistic mini-opera featuring people from his life (\"Brain Dead\", \"Whenever I Dream\", \"Eating Myself Up Alive\", \"The Music Still Plays On\") concluding with a friendly Mr. Bungee telling Gordon (“Don’t Give In”), leading him back to consciousness. Dr. Berensteiner celebrates the successful surgery (\"Craniotomy (Reprise)\"). Gordon and Roger fool around in the hospital shower, much to Richard's dismay (\"You Boys Are Gonna Get Me In Such Trouble\"). Gordon expresses his new appreciation for life (\"Sailing (Reprise)\"). \n\nMonths later, Gordon has recovered and is enjoying a new, more fulfilled life with Roger. They run into Lisa, who is selling Gordon's books that Mimi threw out. Gordon and Roger ask for them back, but she refuses (\"The Homeless Lady's Revenge\"). She flees, leaving Gordon furious, but Roger calms him down (\"Time\"). Gordon has overcome his fear of dying with his greatest songs inside him (\"Time and Music\"). With his life at last in balance, he is able to write again and finishes the spring song (\"I Feel so Much Spring\").\n\n\n\" *Not included in the Original Cast Recording\"<br>\n\" +Not included in the 2015 City Center Revival\"\n\nBen Brantley, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote: \"The problem is that for Mr. Finn (and probably, alas, for most people), happiness is definitely a blander muse than anxiety. \"A New Brain,\" which has been directed with wit and elegance by Graciela Daniele, has moments of captivating eccentricity. But watching it is often like passing a group of animated, slightly drunken revelers on the street: you're glad they have something to celebrate, but it's a private party, and you walk on by with a faint smile. Mr. Finn originally conceived what became \"A New Brain\" as a series of revue numbers, and it might have worked better in that format. As a story, shaped by Mr. Finn and his longtime collaborator, James Lapine, the show has a spliced-together feeling, a disjunctive quality at odds with the holistic spirit it seems to be aiming for.\"\n\n\n"}

An example of the last case is the Assembly Hall (Washington, Mississippi) where the general assembly of the state of Mississippi was held. Some Christian denominations call their meeting places or places of worship assembly halls, for example the Salt Lake Assembly Hall. Elders and ministers of Presbyterian churches gather in assembly halls for their general assembly, such as in the General Assembly Hall of the Church of Scotland.\n\nA function hall, reception hall, or banquet hall is a room or building for the purpose of hosting a party, banquet, wedding or other reception, or other social event. Function halls are often found within pubs, clubs, hotels, or restaurants. Some are run by fraternal organizations and rented out as part of them being a club, for example Masonic Halls. \nThe first recorded mention of \"function rooms\" is in 1922.\n\nOn the campuses of colleges and universities in the United States, assembly halls are sometimes found in multi-purpose athletic buildings, where they share other uses, including as basketball courts.

The first summit was held during December 2008 in Fukuoka, Japan. The talks are focused on maintaining strong trilateral relations, the regional economy and disaster relief.\n\nThe summits were first proposed by South Korea in 2004, as a meeting outside the framework of the ASEAN Plus Three, with the three major economies of East Asia having a separate community forum. In November 2007 during the ASEAN Plus Three meeting, the leaders of China, Japan and Korea held their eighth meeting, and decided to strengthen political dialogue and consultations between the three countries, eventually deciding on an ad hoc meeting to be held in 2008.\n\nIn September 2011, the three countries launched the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat in Seoul. The Secretary-General is appointed on a two-year rotational basis in the order of Korea, Japan, and China. Each country other than the one of the Secretary-General nominates a Deputy Secretary-General respectively.\n\nThe first separate meeting of the leaders of the three countries was held in Fukuoka, Japan. During the meeting, the \"Joint Statement between the three partners\" was signed and issued, which identified the direction and principles behind cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea. The conference adopted the \"International Financial and Economic Issues Joint Statement\", \"Disaster Management of the Three Countries Joint Statement\" and \"Action plan to promote cooperation between China, Japan and South Korea\".\n\nOne of the topics discussed focused in the improvement of future relations between the three countries, from strategic and long-term perspectives. Prior talks between the three countries have been hindered specifically by various territorial and historical disputes. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao stated that \"China is willing to make joint efforts with Japan to continue to develop the strategic and mutually beneficial ties in a healthy and stable manner, to benefit the peoples of the two countries and other nations in the region as well.\" Japanese prime minister Tarō Asō also expressed that he believed the best manner in dealing with the economic crisis of 2008 was economic partnership. There is also speculation of a future regional Free trade area. Such co-operation would greatly benefit the three nations, which account for two thirds of total trade, 40% of total population and three quarters of the GDP of Asia (20% of global GDP ), during the ongoing economic crisis.\n\nThe second summit was held in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Despite the worries of limitations that the summit has faced in 2008, this all changed in 2009, when Japan, China and Korea were forced to coordinate and cooperate more closely to manage the regional effects of the global financial crisis.\n\nIn their joint statement on the crisis, the trio identified the need to cooperate on global issues (such as financial risk) and in global institutions, including at the G20. While a reaction to global events, this cooperation began to significantly affect the management of East Asia. Over the course of 2009, the three nations resolved their long running dispute over contributions (and thus voting weight) in the Chiang Mai Initiatives, the first major ‘success’ of the ASEAN Plus Three process. The three nations also worked together to push through a general capital increase at the Asian Development Bank to help it fight the effects of the global financial crisis, a decision mandated by the G20 but about which the US appeared ambivalent.\n\nThe third summit among these three countries was held in Jeju, Korea. The prime minister of Korea, Lee Myung bak hosted the meeting and China's prime minister, Wen Jiabao, Japan's prime minister Yukio Hatoyama attended the meeting. One document called the 2020 Cooperation Prospect was released, which firstly emphasized that the three countries will face up to history and cooperate for the future development. Also, looking forward to the specific goals that should be achieved in the next ten years, this document stressed the importance to concentrate on the cooperation in different fields.\n\nIn the progress of institutionalizations and improvements of the partnership, the leaders decided to enhance the communication and strategic mutual trust. The leaders agreed to establish a secretariat in Korea in 2011 to confront the natural disaster, discuss the possibility to build up the 'defense dialogue mechanism', improve the policing cooperation and boost the communication among the government. In terms of sustainable development and common prosperity, the leaders said they would try to complete the survey of the Trilateral Free Trade Area before 2012; improve the trade volume; enhance trade facilitation and they restated that they would attach great importance to the customs cooperation; make efforts to the negotiation about investment agreement and offer necessary infrastructure for the improvement of the free flow of investment capital; enhance the coordination of the financial departments; improve the effectiveness of the multilateral Chiang mai initiate; reject all forms of trade protectionism; improve the cooperation in science and innovation; and strengthen the cooperation and consultation policies in the fields of industry, energy, the energy efficiency and resource.\n\nBecause the previous three summit meetings covered a wide range of world issues, they did not produce any concrete outcome. There was no agreement on North Korea’s nuclear development or on the March and September 2010 incidents involving North Korea. Moreover, although the leaders of the three countries had agreed to set up a permanent secretariat headquartered in Seoul to facilitate trilateral cooperation, it has still not been implemented. The three leaders had also agreed to strengthen mutual understanding and trust, expand cooperation in trade, investment, finance, and environmental protection. Not much progress has been achieved in these areas as well over the past one year.\n\nThe fourth meeting was held in the wake of the nuclear accident at Fukushima and the natural disaster in Japan. Prime Minister Kan Naoto proposed to hold the summit in Fukushima to convey the message to the world that Fukushima has already become a safe place. The Japanese government hoped that if the heads of the three countries gather in the crisis-stricken city, radiation fears will be mitigated. However, due to logistic problems, the meeting could not be held in Fukushima and instead was held in Tokyo.\n\nWhile Japan was accused of not providing its neighbours with accurate information when radioactive materials leaked at Fukushima, the summit led to agreement to establish an emergency notification system, enhance cooperation among experts, and share information in the event of emergencies.\n\n14 May 2012, Leaders from China, Japan, and South Korea concluded the Fifth Trilateral Summit Meeting and signed the Trilateral Agreement for the Promotion, Facilitation and Protection of Investment (hereinafter referred as the Trilateral Agreement) at a summit in Beijing. The Trilateral Agreement represents a stepping stone towards a three-way free trade pact to counter global economic turbulence and to boost economic growth in Asia.\n\nAccording to a joint declaration, the three nations will further enhance the “future-oriented comprehensive cooperative partnership” to unleash vitality into the economic growth of the three countries, accelerate economic integration in East Asia, and facilitate economic recovery and growth in the world.\n\nIn the joint declaration, the three nations list directions and prioritization of future cooperation, which includes enhancing mutual political trust, deepening economic and trade cooperation, promoting sustainable development, expanding social, people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and strengthening communication and coordination in regional and international affairs.\n\nAmong all these proposals, the signing of the Trilateral Agreement and the decision to endorse the recommendation from the trade ministers to launch the trilateral FTA negotiations within this year are at the top of the priority list in deepening economic and trade cooperation.\n\nThe 6th trilateral summit was held on 1 November 2015 in Seoul, resuming the summit since 2012 due to varieties of disputes and issues ranging from World War II apologies to territorial disputes among the three nations. During the summit, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, and South Korean President Park Geun-hye agreed to meet annually in order to work towards deepening trade relations with the proposed trilateral free trade agreement. They also agreed to pursue the six-party talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons program.\n\n\n\n"}

Three years later it was consuming 12% of the government's budget and in 1846 came under the scrutiny of Congress, but the government refused to provide details of the operation of the fund.\n\nThe Contingency Fund for Foreign Intercourse was established at the request of President of the United States George Washington in July 1790 with an initial operating appropriation of $40,000. Within three years this amount had grown to more than $1 million, consuming roughly 12 percent of the United States federal budget. The terms of the appropriation permitted Washington (and eventually his successors) to conceal the nature and purpose of expenditures made from the fund. Information about activities funded by the Contingency Fund are sparse, however, it is known they were generally \"ad hoc\" covert operations directed against European states.\n\nIn 1831 Senator John Forsyth described the purpose of the fund as one designed to finance the operation of \"spies, if the gentleman pleases; for persons sent publicly and secretly to search for important information, political or commercial ... for agents to feel the pulse of foreign governments.\"\n\nBy 1846 the Contingency Fund for Foreign Intercourse had come under increasing congressional scrutiny. Whigs in the United States House of Representatives requested a full accounting of expenditures made under the fund during the just-completed administration of John Tyler, a request then-president James Polk rebuffed, declaring that \"in no nation is the application of such funds made public.\"\n\nIn the 1880s the first permanent U.S. government intelligence services were established in the form of the Office of Naval Intelligence and the Military Intelligence Division.\n\nIn its first year of existence, 1790, the fund was used to finance a sensitive diplomatic mission by Gouverneur Morris in London regarding outstanding boundary matters between the United States and United Kingdom. The first use of the fund to underwrite covert activities, meanwhile, occurred shortly thereafter when the United States secretly paid ransoms and tributes to the Barbary States for the release of American hostages and promises of non-interference with American shipping.\n\nIn 1812 James Madison used $50,000 from the fund, equivalent to the cost of a naval frigate, to acquire the Henry letters, purported correspondence between alleged British spy John Henry and the Governor-General of Canada. The publication of the papers by Madison helped generate sufficient public outrage to secure the passage of the United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom. Madison also tapped the fund to secretly finance paramilitary forces in Florida as a pressure against Spain.\n\nAccording to a public statement made by president John Tyler, Duff Green was paid $1,000 from the fund to finance an operation in the United Kingdom in 1841 that influenced the appointment of the Lord Ashburton as the British negotiator in the Maine-New Brunswick border dispute. The ultimate settlement of that dispute resulted in the net transfer of about of territory to the United States by the United Kingdom, to the consternation of many in Canada.\n\n"}

This festival marks the end of Ramadan and is also shared with eid el Kabir and eid el Fitri, Muslim holidays. It begins with prayers, followed by a parade of the Emir and his entourage on horses, accompanied by musicians, and ending at the Emir's palace. Durbar festivals are organised in cities such as Kano, Katsina, Sokoto, Zaria and Bida, and are considered tourist attractions.\n\nThe Durbar festival was introduced to Nigeria by colonial administrators with political objectives in mind. The word Durbar is of Persian origin and it was first linked to ceremonial assemblies marking the proclamation of Queen Victoria as the Empress of colonial India in 1877. In Nigeria, the events then were ceremonial in nature, the first Durbar was held in 1911, subsequent ceremonies were held in 1924, 1925, 1948, 1960 and 1972. The ceremonies linked together pre-colonial aspects of martial display, colonist created assemblies and celebrations of important events in Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe Durbar festival featured prominently in the 2nd World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture sometimes known as Festac 77. Since Festac, the colonial origins was gradually phased out and the events were linked with pre-colonial traditions such as the importance of horses for military purposes and ceremonies in the Bornu Empire and the ceremonies of 'Hawan Sallah' and 'Hawan Idi'.\n\n"}

{"id": "418480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=418480", "title": "EgyptAir Flight 648", "text": "EgyptAir Flight 648\n\nEgyptAir Flight 648 was a regularly scheduled international flight between Athens Ellinikon International Airport in Greece and Cairo International Airport in Egypt. On 23 November 1985, a Boeing 737-200 airliner, registered SU-AYH, servicing the flight was hijacked by the terrorist organization Abu Nidal. The subsequent raid on the aircraft by Egyptian troops resulted in dozens of deaths, making the hijacking of Flight 648 one of the deadliest such incidents in history. \n\nOn 23 November 1985, Flight 648 took off at 8pm on its Athens-to-Cairo route. Ten minutes after takeoff, three Palestinian members of Abu Nidal hijacked the aircraft. The terrorists, calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were heavily armed with guns and grenades. The terrorist leader, Omar Rezaq, proceeded to check all passports. At this point, an Egyptian Security Service agent, Mustafa Kamal, aboard opened fire, killing one terrorist before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the fuselage was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to to allow the crew and passengers to breathe.\n\nLibya was the original destination for the hijackers, but due to negative publicity the hijacking would have had if flown to Libya and the fact that the plane did not have enough fuel, Malta was chosen as a more suitable option. The aircraft was running dangerously low on fuel, experiencing serious pressurization problems and carrying a number of wounded passengers. However, Maltese authorities did not give permission for the aircraft to land; the Maltese government had previously refused permission to other hijacked aircraft, including on 23 September 1982 when an Alitalia aircraft was hijacked on its way to Italy. The EgyptAir 648 hijackers insisted, and forced the pilot, Hani Galal, to land at Luqa Airport. As a last-ditch attempt to stop the landing, the runway lights were switched off, but the pilot managed to land the damaged aircraft safely.\n\nNationalities of the passengers included the following:\nThe Mexican passengers were actress Lupita Pallás and her daughter Laila Ortiz de Pinedo, mother and sister of Mexican actor Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo.\n\nAt first, Maltese authorities were optimistic they could solve the crisis. Malta had good relations with the Arab world, and 12 years earlier had successfully resolved a potentially more serious situation when a KLM Boeing 747 landed there under similar circumstances. The Maltese Prime Minister, Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici, rushed to the airport's control tower and assumed responsibility for the negotiations. Aided by an interpreter, he refused to refuel the aircraft, or to withdraw Maltese armed forces which had surrounded the plane, until all passengers were released. Eleven passengers and two injured flight attendants were allowed off the plane. The hijackers then started shooting hostages, starting with Tamar Artzi, an Israeli woman, whom they shot in the head and back. Artzi survived her wounds. Rezaq, the chief hijacker, threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. His next victim was Nitzan Mendelson, another Israeli woman, killing her. He then shot three Americans – Patrick Scott Baker, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp and Jackie Nink Pflug. Of the five passengers shot, Artzi, Baker and Pflug survived; Mendelson died in a Maltese hospital a week after the hijacking. A British passenger commented that he saw that Rezaq had to raise his gun in order to shoot Baker, who was about 6' 5\" tall.\n\nFrance, the United Kingdom and the United States all offered to send anti-hijack forces. Bonnici was under heavy pressure from both the hijackers and from the United States and Egypt, whose ambassadors were at the airport. The non-aligned Maltese government feared that the Americans or the Israelis would arrive and take control of the area, as the U.S. Naval Air Station Sigonella was only 20 minutes away. A U.S. Air Force C-130 Hercules with an aeromedical evacuation team from Rhein-Main Air Base (2nd Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron) near Frankfurt, Germany, and rapid-deploying surgical teams from Wiesbaden Air Force Medical Center were on standby at the U.S. Navy Hospital at Naples. When the U.S. told Maltese authorities that Egypt had a special forces counterterrorism team trained by the U.S. Delta Force ready to move in, they were granted permission to come. The Egyptian Unit 777 under the command of Major-General Kamal Attia was flown in, led by four American officers. Negotiations were prolonged as much as possible, and it was agreed that the plane should be attacked on the morning of 25 November when food was to be taken into the aircraft. Soldiers dressed up as caterers would jam the door open and attack.\n\nWithout warning Egyptian commandos launched the raid about an hour and a half before it had been originally planned. They blasted open the passenger doors and luggage compartment doors with explosives. Bonnici claimed that these unauthorized explosions caused the internal plastic of the plane to catch fire, causing widespread suffocation. On the other hand, the \"Times of Malta\", quoting sources at the airport on the day, held that when the hijackers realized that they were being attacked, they lobbed hand grenades into the passenger area, killing people and starting the fire aboard.\n\nThe storming of the aircraft killed 54 of the remaining 87 passengers, as well as two crew members and one hijacker. Only one hijacker — Omar Rezaq, who had survived — remained undetected by the Maltese government. The terrorist leader, who was injured during the storming of the aircraft, had removed his hood and ammunition and pretended to be an injured passenger. Egyptian commandos tracked Rezaq to St. Luke's General Hospital and, holding the doctors and medical staff at gunpoint, entered the casualty ward looking for him. He was arrested when some of the passengers in the hospital recognized him.\n\nA total of 58 of the 95 passengers and crew had died, as well as two of the three hijackers, by the time the crisis was over. Maltese medical examiners estimated that eight passengers were shot dead by the commandos.\n\nRezaq faced trial in Malta, but with no anti-terrorism legislation, he was tried on other charges. There was widespread fear that terrorists would hijack a Maltese plane or carry out a terrorist attack in Malta as an act of retribution. Rezaq received a 25-year sentence, of which he served eight. His release caused a diplomatic incident between Malta and the U.S. because Maltese law strictly prohibited trying a person twice, in any jurisdiction, on charges connected to the same series of events (having wider limitations compared to classic double jeopardy). Following his immediate expulsion on release, he was captured on arrival in Nigeria. After three months he was handed over to the U.S., brought before a U.S. court and, on 7 October 1996, sentenced to life imprisonment with a no-parole recommendation.\n\nIn his 1989 book \"Massacre in Malta\", John A. Mizzi writes:\n\nMizzi adds:\n\nMizzi also mentions how Maltese soldiers positioned in the vicinity of the aircraft were equipped with rifles but were not issued ammunition. An Italian secret service report on the incident showed how the fire inside the aircraft was caused by the Egyptian commandos who placed explosives in the aircraft cargo hold – the most vulnerable part of the aircraft, as it held the oxygen tanks which blew up. During the hijacking, only the Socialist Party media and state-controlled television were given information on the incident. Such was the censorship of the media, that the Maltese people first heard of the disaster through RAI TV, when its correspondent Enrico Mentana spoke live on the air via a direct phone call: \"Parlo da Malta. Qui c'è stato un massacro ...\" (\"I'm speaking from Malta. Here there's just been a massacre ...\") Shortly before this broadcast, a news bulletin on the Maltese national television had erroneously stated that all passengers had been released and were safe.\n\nDecisions taken by the Maltese government drew criticism from overseas. The United States protested to Malta about U.S. personnel sent to resolve the issue having been confined to Air Squadron HQ and the U.S. Embassy in Floriana. The United States had seen the situation as so ‘hot’ that it had ordered a number of its naval ships, including an aircraft carrier, to move toward Malta for contingency purposes.\n\nEgyptAir still flies the Athens–Cairo route, now assigned flight numbers 748 and 750 and is now performed by Boeing 737-800. The flight number 648 \nis now on its Riyadh–Cairo route.\n\nThe events of the hijacking were related in an account by American survivor Jackie Nink Pflug, who had been shot in the head, on the Biography Channel television program \"I Survived...\", which was broadcast on 13 April 2009. Laurence Zrinzo, the neurologist and neurosurgeon who established neurosurgery as a sub-speciality in the Maltese islands, performed Ms Pflug's neurosurgical procedure. Ms Pflug also related details about the flight and the attack in her 2001 book, \"Miles to Go Before I Sleep\". The incident was chronicled and reenacted in an \"Interpol Investigates\" episode, \"Terror in the Skies\", broadcast by the National Geographic Channel.\n\nThe hijacking is also the subject of the book \"Valinda, Our Daughter\", written by Canadian author Gladys Taylor.\n\nThe events of the hijacking are described in and used to further the plot in Brad Thor's novel Path of the Assassin.\n\n\n"}

At the start of the second race of the second round of the 1974 series, two cars were racing for the lead. They collided and Hiroshi Kazato and Seiichi Suzuki crashed into them, causing a fire. Both Kazato, 25, and Suzuki, 37, were killed. The race was immediately abandoned, and the circuit was reconstructed with the hairpin first corner that exists to this day, bypassing the banking.\n\nA change in the rules in 1979 made it possible for single seat sportscars, similar to the revived Can-Am series, to race in the series.\n\nIn the second race of 1983 Famiyasu Sato was killed in practice. Later in the series, Toru Takahashi was killed when his car spun, and the aerodynamics of the car caused it to fly through the air, driver's head-first into the catch fencing, also killing a spectator. This led to a further change in the circuit where a chicane was added in 300R (the final corner) to slow the cars.\n\nThe maximum engine size limit was increased to 3 litres in 1987. In 1988, the series changed its name from Fuji Grand Champion series to Grand Champion series because some races added into the championship were not held at Fuji.\n\nThe late 1980s saw attendance dropping, and after 1989 the series folded.\n\nThe series was revived again in 2002 as GC-21, like its predecessor; the series used Dallara GC21 cars, which were rebodied F3 cars powered by 3S-GTE engines.

It was sponsored by Bruce Lundvall, the president of Columbia Records, Jerry Masucci, the president of Fania Records, and the Cuban Ministry of Culture.\n\nThe festival included, on the American side, Weather Report, the CBS Jazz All-Stars, the Trio of Doom, Fania All-Stars, Stephen Stills, Billy Swan, Bonnie Bramlett, Mike Finnigan, Kris Kristofferson, Tony Williams, Jaco Pastorius, Rita Coolidge, and Billy Joel. The Cuban acts included Irakere, Pacho Alonso, Zaida Arrate, Elena Burke, Orquesta de Santiago de Cuba, Conjunto Yaguarimú, Frank Emilio Flynn, Juan Pablo Torres, Los Papines, Tata Güines, Cuban Percussion Ensemble, Sara González, Pablo Milanés, Manguaré, and Orquesta Aragón.\n\nIn 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Cuban President Fidel Castro started to loosen the political tension between the two countries and opened Interest Sections both in Havana and Washington. It was the first time in almost two decades after Castro's rise to power that there was a real interest in establishing a normalization of diplomatic relations and the lifting of the United States embargo against Cuba.\n\nWith a real crisis in the music industry in the United States and the start of the salsa boom, in April 1978, CBS Records director, Bruce Lundvall, saw an open door to probe Cuban music and together with a group of the company's music enthusiasts made a four-day trip to Havana, where they were overwhelmed by the sound of Cuban music, but especially by Afro-Cuban jazz band Irakere, one of Cuba's most highly regarded and virtuoso musical acts.\n\nAfter months of talks, Lundvall managed to sign Irakere and in July the group traveled to New York to perform an unannounced guest set at the famed Newport Jazz Festival-New York. Rave reviews led to an invitation from the prestigious Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland.\n\nA few months later, Irakere won their first Grammy with the album Irakere, recorded at their Montreux Jazz Festival and Newport Jazz Festival performances, and Lundvall wanted to try his luck with other Cuban bands too. So, in the Fall of 1978, he joined forces with Fania Records director Jerry Masucci and convinced the Cuban cultural authorities to organize a three-day festival in Havana with the participation of Cuban and American musicians. The event would be recorded and televised for the enjoyment of both the Cuban and American people.\n\nSo they all agreed to set a date for the festival, spontaneously entitled Havana Jam. March 2 through 4, 1979, were the days earmarked for this historical step toward establishing a cultural exchange between the two enemy nations. In order to carry out the Herculean task of planning, Lundvall brought aboard Jock McLean and Phil Sandhaus, of Columbia's artists development department. Both veterans of major concert promotion, they knew the festival needed professional production of the highest caliber, and enlisted Showco (a Dallas-based concert production company) and Studio Instrument Rentals for the task.\n\nAt this point in time, Lundvall was diligently \"feeling out\" select members of the Columbia artist roster, all of whom were honored to accept the invitation to perform in Cuba. By early February the talent was confirmed. Representing the U.S. would be Billy Joel, Stephen Stills, Weather Report, Kris Kristofferson with Rita Coolidge, the Fania All-Stars and the CBS Jazz All-Stars. The latter group was conceptualized by Lundvall and scheduled to feature more than 20 top jazz artists on the label.\n\nWith the festival within grasp, other CBS Records personnel were summoned into the picture-rehearsals were set up for the CBS Jazz All-Stars, travel accommodations were made, equipment was rented, a wide cross-section of media was invited, and both recording and videotaping plans were confirmed.\n\nRecord producers Bert deCoteaux and Mike Berniker flew down with a crew from the CBS Recording Studios along with a support team and mobile 24-track Recording Studio from Record Plant NY.\n\nEngineered by David Hewitt with Phil Gitomer and Michael Guthrie. McLean, Sandhaus, Freston and various other people were already busy working in Havana's Karl Marx Auditorium when the musicians landed at the José Martí airport on March 1.\n\nHavana Jam was an invitation-only event, with mostly cultural personalities and members of the Communist Party and their children in attendance, though some students from different art and music schools were also invited.\n\nThe festival was hardly mentioned on the Cuban press, and thirty years later not many Cubans know it ever existed.\n\nWith the hall filled to capacity, Weather Report opened the show, offering an assortment of sound effects before launching into their set. The audience repeatedly rose to its feet during the program, setting the festival's prevailing mood of \"music over politics\". Backstage, Weather Report's members (Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Jaco Pastorius and Peter Erskine) were later congratulated by an assortment of Cuban musicians and fans, most of whom were familiar with the group's repertoire through the aid of Florida radio, mostly AM stations such as WQAM, WGBS, WKWF and WLCY.\n\nWeather Report was followed by two traditional Cuban ensembles of differing styles. The first, Conjunto Yaguarimú, featured vocalists Zaida Arrate and Pacho Alonso, who interpreted \"dated\" Cuban music. The second group, Orquesta Aragón, played some of the most dynamic music of the festival, utilizing its charanga sound of violins, cello, flute and rhythm section.\n\nThe concert was running very late, and people began to leave the hall because of a midnight public transportation curfew. Hence, when the Fania All-Stars took the stage the house was half empty, yet the excitement of this ensemble-featuring practically every top name in salsa still captured the spirit of the audience. The ensemble included top salsa artists of the likes of Rubén Blades, Johnny Pacheco, Pete Rodríguez, Héctor Lavoe, Larry Harlow, Santos Colón, Luigi Texidor, Pupi Legarreta, Papo Lucca, Roberto Roena, Adalberto Santiago, Sal Cuevas, Wilfrido Vargas, and other Latin superstars.\n\nLeading off Saturday evening's entertainment was the first grouping of the CBS Jazz All-Stars, composed of Dexter Gordon, Stan Getz, Jimmy Heath, Arthur Blythe, Woody Shaw, Hubert Laws, Bobby Hutcherson, Willie Bobo, Cedar Walton, Percy Heath and Tony Williams. The group performed several tunes by Walton and Jimmy Heath that had the crowd on its feet after every solo.\n\nThe stage was then turned over to the \"once-in-a-life-time\" Trio of Doom, including luminaries John McLaughlin, Jaco Pastorius and Tony Williams. The highly amplified trio captivated the audience with its unique sound. As a finale, a third ensemble came onstage: Blythe, Jimmy Heath, Laws, Bobo, Richard Tee, Rodney Franklin, Eric Gale, John Lee and Gerry Brown. Although their set was limited to two selections, the assemblage was also well received.\n\nWhat followed was the highlight of the festival, the 25-member Cuban Percussion Ensemble. The entourage featured some of the biggest names in modern Cuban drumming, such as Tata Güines, Los Papines, Guillermo Barreto and Changuito, backed by pianist Frank Emilio and his quartet.\n\nAfter a masterful percussion set, Cuba was treated to its first taste of rock 'n' roll by Stephen Stills. He performed a high-energy set that featured a top-notch band that included Bonnie Bramlett and Mike Finnigan. Stills gave a sampling of his various hits throughout the years, and then jumped into the audience with his remote control guitar and sang a salute to the audience entitled Cuba Al Fin.\n\nIrakere closed the show, spurred on by the high energy audience in the theater. Featuring leader keyboardist Chucho Valdés, Irakere pulled out all stops. The group was then joined by Rodney Franklin, Richard Tee, John McLaughlin, Willie Bobo, Stan Getz, Jaco Pastorius and others in an all-out jam session, bringing the evening's proceedings to an abrupt halt at 3 A.M.\n\nLeading off Sunday evening's performances was trombone player Juan Pablo Torres, followed by Cuban singer Elena Burke. Appearing next on the bill were Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, backed by an excellent band composed of Billy Swan and other top musicians. Kristofferson performed first, singing many of his hit songs which were recognized by the audience. The tunes were interspersed with Kris's well-meaning stabs at speaking Spanish. The house was rocking as Rita Coolidge took the stage and the Cubans all sang along to Coolidge's AM-radio hits. The evening was propelled one step further when Sara González sang several numbers accompanied by Pablo Milanés y Grupo Manguaré. Then came the festival's finale, Billy Joel. Unlike most of the other acts, Joel's performance was not recorded or videotaped.\n\nIn 1979, Columbia released two double albums of the festival performances, \"Havana Jam\" and \"Havana Jam 2\". The Fania All-Stars's set was released later that year as \"Havana Jam on Fania\". The Trio of Doom performance was released in 2007 as \"Trio of Doom\".\n\nThe event is recollected and revived in Ernesto Juan Castellanos's 2009 documentary \"Havana Jam '79\".\n\n\n"}

In general inhaled insulins have been more rapidly absorbed than subcutaneous injected insulin, with faster peak concentration in serum and more rapid metabolism. \n\nExubera, developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics), became the first inhaled insulin product to be marketed in 2006 by Pfizer, but poor sales led Pfizer to withdraw it in 2007. Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind, was approved by the FDA in 2014.\n\nInsulin was introduced by Banting and Best from the University of Toronto in 1921 as an injectable agent. German researchers first introduced the idea of inhalable insulin in 1924. Years of failure followed until scientists realized they might be able to use new technologies to turn insulin into a concentrated powder with particles sized for inhalation.\n\nIn the 1980s Nektar Therapeutics developed technology to make insulin into small particles that they licensed to Pfizer; Alkermes developed a delivery device that they licensed to Eli Lilly and Company.\n\nOnce concrete methods were developed, human tests began in the late 1990s. In January 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of Exubera, a form of inhalable insulin developed by Pfizer; it was approved in the UK in August 2006 but reimbursed by the National Health Service only for people who had problems with needles; it was not reimbursed by any US insurer.A 2007 systematic review concluded that the inhaled hexameric insulin (Exubera) \"appears to be as effective, but no better than injected short-acting insulin. The additional cost is so much more that it is unlikely to be cost-effective.\" In 2007, Pfizer announced that it would no longer manufacture or market Exubera. According to Chairman and CEO Jeffrey Kindler this was because Exubera \"failed to gain acceptance among patients and physicians\".\n\nAt the time of Exubera's discontinuation, several other companies were pursuing inhaled insulin including Alkermes working with Eli Lilly and Company, MannKind Corporation, and Aradigm working with Novo Nordisk. By March 2008, all of these products had been discontinued because investors all decided to withdrew their fund, except for MannKind's Afrezza product.\n\nOn March 16, 2009 MannKind submitted an NDA for their inhalable insulin. In 2011 the FDA denied approval of Afrezza and because the design of the delivery device had changed, the FDA requested additional clinical trials to ensure that people would use it the same way as the earlier versions. After conducting further studies, Mannkind submitted a new application, and in June, 2014, the FDA approved Afrezza for both Type I and Type II adult diabetics, with a label restriction for patients having asthma, active lung cancer or COPD. In 2014 Mannkind and Sanofi agreed that Sanofi would take over manufacturing and marketing of Afrezza, but Sanofi said it was dropping the effort in January 2016 due to poor sales of $7.5 million in 2015; the companies formally terminated the agreement in November 2016. At the time that Sanofi announced it was dropping the product Mannkind said it would continue alone, and it had taken over manufacturing and relaunched the drug by July 2016. According to results presented at the 2018 meeting of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), Afrezza increases the time that blood glucose levels remain in optimal range (70 – 180 mg/dl), reducing both spikes in blood glucose and time in hypoglycemia in adults with Type I diabetes, compared to insulin Aspart. \n"}

It has been held since 1987.\n\nIt is organised by the Delhi Tourism and Transportation Development Corporation (DTTDC) in collaboration with the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, the National Horticultural Board and the New Delhi Municipal Council. As in recent past years, the festival was held in the Talkatora Indoor Stadium.\nA tourism official explained: \nMore than 50 mango growers from across the country, mainly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat and Delhi, were given an interactive platform to present the 'king of fruits' [...] The visitors, who normally think mango has just five or six varieties, were educated through quizzes and competitions about the huge variety of the fruit grown and innumerable possibilities of using mango in cuisine. They also enjoyed colourful entertainment programmes of music and dance. [...] It is an informal and international platform with a two-fold approach, to promote tourism as well as mango export.\nMore than 550 varieties and cultivars of mango are featured in the festival for visitors to view and taste. Among these are alphonso, mallika, amrapali, himsagar, malda, balia, chorasya, dhaman, dhoon, fazia, gelchia, nigarin kheria, ruchika and shamasi. Notable chefs from five star hotels like the Maurya Sheraton, Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Inter-Continental Hotel, Marriott India, Qutub Hotel and Claridges around India demonstrate the preparation of assorted recipes made with mango.\n\nThe festival is also an opportunity for agro-industries and food industries processing mangoes into jams, pickles, fruit juice and canned fruit to display their products.\nActivities in the festival include cultural programmes and recreational events like a mango eating competition for women, mango slogan writing, a demonstration of mango carving, a magic show, and a quiz about mangoes. For the mango judging competition, there are various categories and a minimum of seven ripe mangoes are required for competing in each. There is also a prize given for biggest mango.\nIn describing International Mango Festival, a reporter for the BBC said: \nSome visitors found the culinary preparations - unusual in a country where the fruit is primarily eaten uncooked - interesting. India exports about 40,000 metric tonnes of mangoes to 80 countries and the annual revenue earned from exporting mangoes and mango products reaches $85 million. Festival organisers hope the event will help to raise these figures significantly. Hindu mythology in India gives the mango an aura of mystique as a symbol of the joy of life.\nMango festivals are also held elsewhere in the world such as one hosted by Fairchild Tropical Gardens in Miami, Florida, United States, another in Cebu, Philippines and a third in Negril, Jamaica.\n\n9 August 2015 There will be 1st International Mango Festival Canada in Mississauga, Ontario\nOrganized by Canadian Friend's Front (CFF) & United Canadian Pakistani Volunteers (UCPV)\n\nMango is an international fruit favored by many countries and loved by many communities in the city of Mississauga. We have chosen Mango to be a center attraction of this event due to diverse and rich cultural communities of Mississauga and keeping their love for it in mind. Almost every community living in Mississauga either produce Mango in their native country or import it, keeping this in mind International Mango Festival Canada is aiming to represent mango from each mango producing region in the world. We believe it is one of the most common factors between the communities here and once we hold such festival it will bring people out and engage them. We would like to engage local city vendors and businesses to participate and showcase their services and merchandise related to mango to support local economy. There has never been such event in Canada and this event will bring city of Mississauga on the map more prominently.\n\n1st Outdoor #Mango Festival Canada will be on 4 June 2016 @ #Celebration Square ( City Hall ) Mississauga. This event is organized by CFFI ( Canadian Friends Front Intl'l & Universal Promotions. And Entry will be Free.\n"}

Godshalk offering a fictionalized account of the exploits of James Brooke in Sarawak in Borneo.\n\nThe novel uses of a variety of writing forms, including diary entries, letters, and straight narrative to tell its story. The author intentionally makes it difficult to determine what \"really\" happens in the story from dreams and fantasies of the characters.\n\nIn 1839, an English adventurer arrived on the northwest coast of Borneo, commissioned to deliver a letter of gratitude to the Sultan of Brunei for having safely returned the crew of a British merchantman, lost on his coast. It was a region full of headhunters, pirate tribes, and slave traders. Most Europeans with the temerity to enter the region had never been heard from again. This particular adventurer, however, seems to know how to play one power against another and manages to keep his balance in the midst of chaos. After performing a service for the Sultan (resolving a local tribal conflict through the use of his schooner's guns and leading an organized assault on a small native river fort), he is named governor of Sarawak, subject to the Sultan of Brunei. Within a few years, he has become the Rajah of Sarawak, an independent state, and established a dynasty that will last one hundred years.\n\nGodshalk has changed names and details while evoking a sense of the time, place, and atmosphere of the real events. The real adventurer was James Brooke; Ms. Godshalk's is named Gideon Barr. James Brooke's schooner was named the \"Royalist\"; Gideon Barr's is the \"Carolina\" (named after his mother). James Brooke was succeeded by his nephew, Charles Johnson, who took the last name Brooke. Gideon Barr is succeeded by his nephew Richard Hogg (Ms. Godshalk does not deal with the change of last name since her story focuses on Gideon's life and ends with his death).\n\nAlthough many of the events described actually took place, one cannot simply change the names and read the novel as history. James Brooke's mother died in 1844, two years after he became Rajah. Gideon's mother dies in Borneo much earlier while he is in grade school in England, providing him an emotional link to Borneo James Brooke did not have. James Brooke never married a European, although there is evidence that he was married to a Malay woman. Gideon Barr marries an Englishwoman to provide himself an \"air of permanence\" as Rajah and we see much of the later portion of the story through Amelia Barr's eyes. Amelia Barr is fictional, but largely based on Margaret Brooke, wife of the second Rajah, and her book \"My Life in Sarawak\". Gideon also maintains a Malayan mistress who provides a note of tragedy in the way her presence poisons Gideon and Amelia's relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the 30,000 pounds that Brooke/Barr inherited at his father's death which enabled him to acquire his schooner, the massacre of the sons of the Sultan of Brunei, the Chinese insurrection of 1857, and the commission of inquiry in Singapore all took place as described. The inquiry in Singapore was concerned with the battle of Labuan in which Brooke/Barr led British warships in a pre-emptive strike against a pirate fleet, breaking the power of the Bugis for the next twenty years. Brooke/Barr's enemies attempted to use this against him by claiming he had used British naval power to slaughter innocent natives.\n\nGodshalk uses Malay words extensively in the book. While she provides a brief Malay glossary as an appendix, it does not cover all the words she uses. Enjoyment of \"Kalimantaan\" will be enhanced if one knows the following Malay words which are not in the glossary provided by the author:\n\n\"Kampilan\", actually a Filipino word, designates a long native sword.\n\n"}

It was first broadcast on 17 May 1991 on Leningrad Television.\n\nThe hoax took the form of an interview on the television program \"Pyatoe Koleso\" (The Fifth Wheel). In the interview, Kuryokhin, impersonating a historian, narrated his findings that Vladimir Lenin consumed large quantities of psychedelic mushrooms and eventually became a mushroom himself. Kuryokhin arrived at his conclusion through a long series of logical fallacies and appeals to the authority of various \"sources\" (such as Carlos Castaneda, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky), creating the illusion of a reasoned and plausible logical chain.\n\nThe timing of the hoax played a large role in its success, coming as it did during the Glasnost period when the ebbing of censorship in the Soviet Union led to many revelations about the country's history, often presented in sensational form. Furthermore, Soviet television had, up to that point, been regarded by its audience as conservative in style and content. As a result, a large number of Soviet citizens (one estimate puts the number at 11,250,000 audience members) took the deadpan \"interview\" at face value, in spite of the absurd claims presented.\n\nSholokhov has said that perhaps the most notable result of the show was an appeal by a group of party members to the Leningrad Regional Committee of the CPSU to clarify the veracity of Kuryokhin's claim. According to Sholokhov, in response to the request one of the top regional functionaries stated that \"Lenin could not have been a mushroom\" because \"a mammal cannot be a plant.\" Modern taxonomy classifies mushrooms as fungi, a separate kingdom from plants.\n\nThe incident has served as a watershed moment in Soviet (and Russian) culture and has often been used as proof of the gullibility of the masses.\n\n"}

In late 2008, the company was shut down by two upstream providers, Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric, because a significant amount of malware and botnets had been trafficking from the McColo servers.\n\nMcColo was formed by a 19-year-old Russian hacker and student named Nikolai. Nikolai's nickname was \"Kolya McColo\"; hence the name of the provider.\n\nAt the time of termination of its upstream service on November 11, 2008, it was estimated that McColo customers were responsible for a substantial proportion of all email spam then flowing and subsequent reports claim a two-thirds or greater reduction in global spam volume. This reduction had been sustained for some period after the takedown. McColo was one of the leading players in the so-called \"bulletproof hosting\" market — ISPs that will allow servers to remain online regardless of complaints.\n\nAccording to \"Ars Technica\" and other sources, upstream ISPs Global Crossing and Hurricane Electric terminated service when contacted by Brian Krebs and \"The Washington Post\"’s \"Security Fix\" blog, but multiple reports had been published by organisations including SecureWorks, FireEye and ThreatExpert, all naming McColo as the host for much of the world's botnet traffic. According to Joe Stewart, director of malware research for SecureWorks, the Mega-D, Srizbi, Pushdo, Rustock and Warezov botnets all hosted their master servers at McColo; numerous complaints had been made but McColo simply moved offending servers and sites to different subnets. Spamhaus.org reportedly finds roughly 1.5 million computers infected with either Srizbi or Rustock sending spam in an average week.\n\nFollowing the shut down, details began to emerge of the ISP's other clients, which included distributors and vendors of child pornography and other criminal enterprises, including the Russian Business Network.\n\nMcColo gained reconnection briefly on November 19, 2008 via a backup connection agreement common in the industry, but was rapidly shut down again.\n\nThe McColo takedown especially affected Srizbi, the world's largest botnet, with around 500,000 infected nodes as of November 2008. The botnet is reported to be capable of sending around 60 billion spam messages a day, which is more than half of the global total of 100 billion.\n\nSymantec's monthly state of spam report for April 2009 stated that spamming was now back to what it was before McColo was taken offline. Due to botnets being created and old ones being brought back online, it estimated that about 85 percent of all email traffic is spam.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "882887", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=882887", "title": "Musha incident", "text": "Musha incident\n\nThe Musha Incident (; ), also known as the Wushe Rebellion and several other similar names, began in October 1930 and was the last major uprising against colonial Japanese forces in Japanese Taiwan. In response to long-term oppression by Japanese authorities, the Seediq indigenous group in Musha (Wushe) attacked the village, killing over 130 Japanese. In response, the Japanese led a relentless counter-attack, killing over 600 Seediq in retaliation. The handling of the incident by the Japanese authorities was strongly criticised, leading to many changes in aboriginal policy.\n\nPrevious armed resistance to Japanese imperial authority had been dealt with sternly, as evident in responses to previous uprisings such as the Tapani Incident, which resulted in a cycle of rebel attacks and strict Japanese retaliation. However, by the 1930s, armed resistance had largely been replaced by organised political and social movements among the younger Taiwanese generation. Direct police involvement in local administration had been relaxed, many stern punishments were abolished, and some elements of self-government, albeit of questionable effectiveness, had been introduced to colonial Taiwan.\n\nHowever, a different approach was used in order to control Taiwan's indigenous peoples. Formosa Island aborigines were still designated as , and treated as savages rather than equal subjects. Tribes were 'tamed' through assimilation, the process of disarming traditional hunting tribes and forcing them to relocate to the plains and lead an agrarian existence. Further resistance was then dealt with by military campaigns, isolation and containment. In order to access natural resources in mountainous and forested indigenous-controlled areas, Governor-General Sakuma Samata adopted a more aggressive terrain policy, attempting to pacify or eradicate aboriginal groups in areas scheduled for logging within five years; by 1915, this policy had been largely successful, although resistance still existed in more remote areas.\n\nThe Seediq aborigines in the vicinity of Musha had been considered by Japanese authorities to be one of the most successful examples of this \"taming\" approach, with Chief Mouna Rudao being one of 43 indigenous leaders selected for a tour of Japan a few years earlier. However, resentment still lingered, due largely to police misconduct, the continuing practice of forced labor, and the ill treatment of indigenous beliefs and customs.\n\nIn the days immediately prior to the incident, chief Mona Rudao held a traditional wedding banquet for his son Daho Mona, during which animals were slaughtered and wine was prepared and drunk. A Japanese police officer named Katsuhiko Yoshimura was on patrol in the area, and was offered a cup of wine by Daho Mona as a symbolic gesture. The officer refused, saying that Daho Mona's hands were soiled with blood from the slaughtered animals. Daho Mona attempted to take hold of the officer, insisting he participate, and the officer struck him with his stick. Fighting ensued, and the officer was injured. Chief Mona Rudao attempted to apologize by presenting a flagon of wine at the officer's house, but was rejected. The simmering resentment among the Seediq in Musha was finally pushed to the limit.\n\nOn 27 October 1930, hundreds of Japanese converged on Musha for an athletics meet at the Musyaji Elementary School. Shortly before dawn, Mona Rudao led over 300 Seediq warriors in a raid of strategic police sub-stations to capture weapons and ammunition. They then moved on the elementary school, concentrating their attack on the Japanese in attendance. A total of 134 Japanese, including women and children, were killed in the attack. Two Han Taiwanese dressed in Japanese clothing were also mistakenly killed, one of whom was a girl wearing a Japanese kimono. The Aboriginals aimed to only kill Japanese specifically.\n\nThe Japanese authorities responded with unprecedentedly harsh military action. A press blackout was enforced, and Governor General Eizo Ishizuka ordered a counter-offensive of two thousand troops to be sent to Musha, forcing the Seediq to retreat into the mountains and carry out guerrilla attacks by night. Unable to root out the Seediq despite their superior numbers and firepower, the Japanese faced a political need for a faster solution. Consequently, Japan's army air corps in Taiwan ordered bombing runs over Musha to smoke out the rebels, dropping mustard gas bombs in violation of the Geneva Protocol in what was allegedly the first such use of chemical warfare in Asia. The uprising was swiftly quelled, with any remaining resistance suppressed by the third week of December 1930; Mona Rudao had committed suicide on November 28, but the uprising had continued under other leaders. Of the 1,200 Seediq directly involved in the uprising, 644 died, 290 of whom committed suicide to avoid dishonor.\n\nDue to internal and external criticism of their handling of the incident, Governor-General Kamiyama and Goto Fumio, his chief civil administrator, were forced to resign in January 1931. However, Kamiyama's replacement, Ota Masahiro, also took a harsh approach to controlling Taiwan's indigenous peoples: certain tribes were disarmed and left unprotected, giving their aboriginal enemies an opportunity to annihilate them on behalf of the Japanese administration. Around 500 of the Seediq involved in the Musha Incident surrendered and were subsequently confined to a village near Musha. However, on 25 April 1931, indigenous groups working with the Japanese authorities attacked the village, beheading all remaining males over the age of 15. This came to be known as the \"Second Musha Incident\".\n\nHowever, the uprising did affect a change in the authorities' attitudes and approaches towards aborigines in Taiwan. Musha had been regarded as the most \"enlightened and compliant\" of the aboriginal territories, and the colonial power's inability to prevent the massacre provoked a fear of similar nationalist movements starting in Taiwan, Korea, and Japan itself. A change in policy was clearly needed. Ching suggests that the ideology of imperialisation (\"kominka\") became the dominant form of colonial control; aborigines became represented as imperial subjects on equal footing with other ethnic groups in Taiwan, and were upgraded in status from \"raw savages\" to . Furthermore, Japanization education was intensified, promoting Japanese culture and loyalty to the emperor in the younger generation.\n\nDuring the Musha Incident Seediq Tkdaya under Mona Rudao revolted against the Japanese while the Truku and Toda did not. The rivalry between the Seediq Tkdaya vs the Toda and Truku (Taroko) was aggravated by Musha Incident, since the Japanese had long played them off against each other. Tkdaya land was given to the Truku (Taroko) and Toda by the Japanese after the incident.\n\nThe Musha Incident has been depicted three times in movies, in 1957 in the film \"Qing Shan bi xue\" (), in the 2003 TV drama , and in the 2011 Taiwanese film \"Seediq Bale\". \n\nThe Chinese novel \"Remains of Life\" (originally published in Chinese in 1999, published in English translation in 2017) is a fictionalized account of the aftermath of this incident.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "165480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165480", "title": "Nacht und Nebel", "text": "Nacht und Nebel\n\nNacht und Nebel () was a directive issued by Adolf Hitler on 7 December 1941 targeting political activists and resistance \"helpers\" in World War II to be imprisoned or killed, while the family and the population remained uncertain as to the fate or whereabouts of the Nazi state's alleged offender. Victims who disappeared in these \"Night and Fog\" actions were never heard from again.\n\nThe alliterative hendiadys \"Nacht und Nebel\" (German for \"Night and Fog\") was first used by Wagner in \"Das Rheingold\" (1869) and has since been adopted into everyday German (e.g. it appears in Thomas Mann's \"Der Zauberberg\"). It remains unclear whether the term \"Nacht-und-Nebel-Erlass\" (\"Night and Fog directive\") had been in wide circulation or used publicly before 1945.\n\nEven before the Holocaust gained momentum, the Nazis had begun rounding up political prisoners from both Germany and occupied Europe. Most of the early prisoners were of two sorts: they were either prisoners of personal conviction (belief), political prisoners whom the Nazis deemed in need of \"re-education\" to Nazi ideals, or resistance leaders in occupied western Europe.\n\nUp until the time of the \"Nacht und Nebel\" decree, prisoners from Western Europe were handled by German soldiers in approximately the same way as other countries: according to international agreements and procedures such as the Geneva Convention. Hitler and his upper level staff, however, made a critical decision not to conform to what they considered unnecessary rules and in the process abandoned \"all chivalry towards the opponent\" and removed \"every traditional restraint on warfare.\"\n\nOn 7 December 1941, \"Reichsführer-SS\" Heinrich Himmler issued the following instructions to the Gestapo: \n\nOn 12 December, Armed Forces High Command Feldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel issued a directive which explained Hitler's orders:\n\nThree months later Keitel further expanded on this principle in a February 1942 letter stating that any prisoners not executed within eight days were to be handed over to the Gestapo. and \n\nThe decree was meant to intimidate local populations into submission, by denying friends and families of seized persons any knowledge of their whereabouts or their fate. The prisoners were secretly transported to Germany, and vanished without a trace. In 1945, the abandoned \"Sicherheitsdienst\" (SD) records were found to include merely names and the initials \"NN\" (\"Nacht und Nebel\"); even the sites of graves were unrecorded. The Nazis even coined a new term for those who \"vanished\" in accordance with this decree; they were \"vernebelt\"—\"transformed into mist\". To this day, it is not known how many people disappeared as a result of this order.\n\nThe International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held that the disappearances committed as part of the \"Nacht und Nebel\" program were war crimes which violated both the Hague Conventions and customary international law. Himmler immediately communicated Keitel's directive to various SS stations and within six months the decree was sent to concentration camp commanders by Richard Glücks. The \"Nacht und Nebel\" prisoners were mostly from France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Norway. They were usually arrested in the middle of the night and quickly taken to prisons hundreds of miles away for questioning, eventually arriving at concentration camps such as Natzweiler, Esterwegen or Gross-Rosen, if they survived. Natzweiler concentration camp in particular, became an isolation camp for political prisoners from northern and western Europe under the decree's mandate.\n\nUp to 30 April 1944, at least 6,639 persons were captured under the \"Nacht und Nebel\" orders. Some 340 of them may have been executed. The 1956 film \"Night and Fog\", directed by Alain Resnais, uses the term to illustrate one aspect of the concentration camp system as it was transformed into a system of labour and death camps.\n\nThe reasons for \"Nacht und Nebel\" were many. The policy, enforced in Nazi-occupied countries, meant that whenever someone was arrested, the family would learn nothing about the person's fate. The people arrested, sometimes only suspected resisters, were secretly sent to Germany and perhaps to a concentration camp. Whether they lived or died, the Germans would give out no information to the families involved. This was done to keep the population in occupied countries quiet by promoting an atmosphere of mystery, fear and terror.\n\nThe program made it far more difficult for other governments or humanitarian organizations to accuse the German government of specific misconduct because it obscured whether or not internment or death had even occurred, let alone the cause of the person's disappearance. It thereby kept the Nazis from being held accountable. It allowed across-the-board, silent defiance of international treaties and conventions – one cannot apply the requirements for humane treatment in war if one cannot locate a victim or discern that victim's fate. Additionally, the policy lessened German subjects' moral qualms about the Nazi regime, as well as their desire to speak out against it, by keeping the general public ignorant of the regime's malfeasance and by creating extreme pressure for service members to remain silent.\n\nThe \"Nacht und Nebel\" prisoners' hair was shaved and the women were given a convict costume of a thin cotton dress, wooden sandals and a triangular black headcloth. According to historian Wolfgang Sofsky,\n\nPrisoners of the \"Nacht und Nebel\" transports were marked by broad red bands; on their backs and both trouser legs was a cross, with the letters \"NN\" to its right. From these emblems, it was possible to recognize immediately what class a prisoner belonged to and how he or she was pigeonholed and evaluated by the SS.\n\nThe prisoners were often moved apparently at random from prison to prison such as Fresnes Prison in Paris, Waldheim near Dresden, Leipzig, Potsdam, Lübeck and Stettin. The deportees were sometimes herded 80 at a time with standing room only into slow moving, dirty cattle trucks with little or no food or water on journeys lasting up to five days to their next unknown destination.\n\nAt the camps, the prisoners were forced to stand for hours in freezing and wet conditions at 5:00am every morning, standing strictly to attention, before being sent to work a twelve-hour day with only a twenty-minute break for a scant meal. They were confined in cold and starving conditions; many had dysentery or other illnesses, and the weakest were often beaten to death, shot, guillotined, or hanged, while the others were subjected to torture by the Germans.\n\nWhen the inmates were totally exhausted or if they were too ill or too weak to work, they were then transferred to the Revier (\"Krankenrevier\", sick barrack) or other places for extermination. If a camp did not have a gas chamber of its own, the so-called Muselmänner, or prisoners who were too sick to work, were often killed or transferred to other concentration camps for extermination.\n\nWhen the Allies liberated Paris and Brussels, the SS transported many of its remaining \"Nacht und Nebel\" prisoners to concentration camps deeper in Nazi-controlled territory, such as Ravensbrück concentration camp for women, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp, Buchenwald concentration camp, Schloss Hartheim, or Flossenbürg concentration camp.\n\nEarly in the war, the program caused the mass execution of political prisoners, especially Soviet military prisoners, who in early 1942 outnumbered the Jews in number of deaths even at Auschwitz. As the transports grew and Hitler's troops moved across Europe, that ratio changed dramatically. The \"Nacht und Nebel\" decree was carried out surreptitiously, but it set the background for orders that would follow and established a \"new dimension of fear\". As the war continued, so did the openness of such decrees and orders.\n\nIt can be surmised from various writings that in the beginning the German public knew only a little of the plans Hitler had to enforce a \"New European Order\". As the years passed, despite the best attempts of Goebbels and the Propaganda Ministry with its formidable domestic information control, diaries and periodicals of the time show that information about the harshness and cruelty of the program became progressively known to the German public.\n\nSoldiers brought back information, families on rare occasion heard from or about loved ones, and Allied news sources and the BBC were able to get past censorship sporadically. Although captured archives from the SD contain numerous orders stamped with \"NN\" (\"Nacht und Nebel\"), it has never been determined exactly how many people disappeared as a result of the decree.\n\nHesitant if not outright skeptical at first of reports coming in about the atrocities being committed by the Germans, the Allies' doubts were pushed aside when the French entered the Natzweiler-Struthof camp (one of the \"Nacht und Nebel\" facilities) on 23 November 1944, and discovered a chamber where victims were hung by their wrists from hooks to accommodate the process of pumping poisonous Zyklon-B gas into the room. Keitel later testified at the Nuremberg Trials that of all the illegal orders he had carried out, the \"Nacht und Nebel\" decree was \"the worst of all\".\n\nFormer Supreme Court Justice and chief prosecutor at the international Nuremberg trial, Robert H. Jackson listed the \"terrifying\" \"Nacht und Nebel\" decree with the other horrid crimes committed by the Nazis in his closing address. In part because of his role in carrying out this decree, Keitel was sentenced to death by hanging, despite his insistence on being shot instead due to his military service and rank. At 1:20am on 16 October 1946 Keitel defiantly shouted out, \"Alles für Deutschland! Deutschland über alles!\" just before the trap door opened beneath his feet.\n\n\nHassall, Peter D., (1997), \"Night and Fog Prisoners\".\n"}

It tells the story of Australian bushranger Ned Kelly with an eclectic score combining rock opera, vaudeville and burlesque. The original Australian production played in Adelaide and Sydney in 1977 and 1978.\n\nLivermore began writing \"Ned Kelly\" in 1972 when touring as a performer with the musical \"Hair\" in Perth and Adelaide. Livermore and Flynn had previously collaborated on the musical \"Lasseter\" which was produced in Sydney in 1971 by the Old Tote Theatre Company at the Parade Theatre.\n\nIn the manner of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", a concept album of the musical was made \"prior\" to a stage production. The concept album, released in mid-1974, featured various members of the Australian cast of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", including Jon English as Ned Kelly, Trevor White, John Paul Young and Livermore. Janice Slater sang the role of Ma Kelly.\n\nCreation of the album involved some disharmony between \"Ned Kelly\"'s collaborators, with Bob Ellis brought in by producer Clyde Packer and Flynn to revise existing lyrics and write lyrics for new songs (he is credited on the album as additional lyrics).\n\n\n\nIn 1974, it was announced that Robert Helpmann would direct a production in 1975 to feature Livermore, Jon English and Jeannie Lewis, produced by Packer in partnership with J.C. Williamson's. This production did not eventuate.\n\nIn mid-1977, the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust started planning for the first production of \"Ned Kelly\", to open in Adelaide. Livermore was director and designer, with Keith Bain the choreographer and Michael Carlos musical director. The cast included Nick Turbin as Ned Kelly, Geraldine Turner as Ma Kelly, Doug Parkinson as Joe Byrne and Arthur Dignam as Superintendent Hare.\n\n\"Ned Kelly\" opened 30 December 1977 at the Festival Theatre, Adelaide Festival Centre. It was produced by the Adelaide Festival Centre Trust, Eric Dare, the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust and SAS Channel 10. The musical was capitalised at $250,000 with weekly running costs of $40,000 to $50,000. The production was visually striking, with design features including a full drop curtain containing over 600 hurricane lamps and Kelly's iconic armour represented by a costume of shiny black plastic with geometric bullet holes. Critical reception was negative. The major Adelaide newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser, in its review referred to the show as \"an artistic disaster – a hideous monument to bad taste and theatrical excess\".\n\nThe production transferred to Her Majesty's Theatre in Sydney on 4 February 1978, where critical reception was substantially more positive. After two months, the production closed in Sydney. An expected Melbourne season at the Palais Theatre from early April 1978 did not occur.\n\nThe only professional revival has been a production by the New Moon Theatre Company, directed by Terence O'Connell, that toured the Queensland regional cities of Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Rockhampton in January and February 1982.\n\nOriginal cast member Geraldine Turner performed the ballad \"Die Like a Kelly\" in a 1994 ABC television special on Australian musicals (\"\") and this song is featured on its soundtrack.\n\n"}

{"id": "4075189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4075189", "title": "Pink Floyd live performances", "text": "Pink Floyd live performances\n\nPink Floyd were pioneers in the live music experience, renowned for their lavish stage shows that combine intense visual experiences with music to create a show in which the performers themselves are almost secondary. Pink Floyd's combination of music and visuals set the standard for rock musicians. As well as visuals, Pink Floyd set standards in sound quality with innovative use of sound effects and panning quadrophonic speaker systems.\n\nBesides the music, arguably the most important and certainly the most elaborate part to any Pink Floyd live show is the special effects.\n\nPink Floyd were among the first bands to use a dedicated travelling light show in conjunction with their performances. During the Barrett era, dynamic liquid light shows were projected onto enormous screens behind the band while they played, and the band also incorporated large numbers of strobe lights, which were controlled manually by an engineer. This had the effect of totally obscuring the band itself, except for their shadows, which Barrett took advantage of: he would hold his arms up during parts where he was not required to play, making his shadow grow, shrink and undulate, adding to the visual spectacle. They developed many of these lighting techniques through their fortuitous early association with light artist Mike Leonard.\n\nWhen psychedelia fell out of fashion from about 1970 onwards, elevated platforms of the type conventionally used for roof maintenance in high buildings were brought on tour and filled with lighting equipment to be raised and lowered during performances. Following Roger Waters' departure in 1985, the Pink Floyd light show reached a dazzling pinnacle. Marc Brickman, the group's lighting designer, utilized hundreds of automated intelligent lighting fixtures and lasers, which were state-of-the-art at the time. By the 1994 \"Division Bell\" tour, the band was using extremely powerful, isotope-splitting copper-vapour lasers. These gold-coloured lasers were worth over $120,000 apiece and previously had only been used in nuclear research and high speed photography.\n\nA large circular projection panel dubbed \"Mr Screen\" first made an appearance during performances of \"Dark Side of the Moon\" in 1974 and became a staple thereafter. The high quality, extreme wide angle projection required special high-speed, 35mm, 10,000 watt xenon film projectors, with custom lenses, all designed, built and toured by \"Associates & Ferren\". Specially recorded films and animations were projected onto it, and for 1977 \"In the Flesh\" and 1980–1981 \"The Wall Live\" tours, coloured spotlights were fixed around the rim, an effect which reached its zenith with the dancing patterns of multi-coloured lights in the \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" and \"Division Bell\" tours. In the latter, the screen could be retracted behind the stage when not required, and was tilted horizontally with its peripheral lights focused onto the stage into a single spotlight during the final guitar solo in \"Comfortably Numb\".\n\nSeveral generations of giant glitter balls began with the \"Dark Side of the Moon\" tour. By the \"Division Bell\" tour, the ball had evolved into a globe 4.9 metres in diameter, which rose from the mixing station to a height of 21.3 metres before opening into an array of petals 7.3 metres wide during the final guitar solo of \"Comfortably Numb\", revealing a 12 kilowatt Phobeus HMI lamp inside.\n\nThanks to stage architect/designer Mark Fisher, Pink Floyd's tours became a staple in the industry because of their outstanding special and scenic effects. Pyrotechnics (such as exploding flashpots, an exploding gong and fireworks) and dry ice were used extensively throughout Pink Floyd's career. In 1973's tour to promote \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", a large scale model plane flew over the audience and crashed onto the stage with a spectacular explosion, an effect repeated at the start of \"The Wall\" and the \"Division Bell\" shows. During shows to promote \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\", a similar effect was achieved with a flying bed.\n\nOversized helium balloons were first introduced during the \"Dark Side of the Moon\" tours, but in 1975, this element began to play a central part of the live show. For the U.S. leg of the 1975 tour, a pyramid shaped dirigible was floated above the stage. It proved unstable in windy conditions and blew into the crowd, which tore it into pieces for souvenirs. The trademark giant pig was brought in for \"Animals\" in 1977, floating over the audience, as well as a grotesque 'Nuclear Family', a refrigerator filled with snakes, a television and a Cadillac. In some shows, an envelope of propane gas was put inside the pig, causing it to explode. The inflatables reached their peak in 1980–1981 during \"The Wall\" shows, in which several of the characters from the album were brought to life in the form of fully mobile, giant string puppets with menacing spotlights for eyes, taking the traditional balloons to a new level. The characters were designed by the notable satirical artist, Gerald Scarfe.\n\nSpecial effects reached a new and outrageous level during these \"Wall\" shows. For example, a long, high wall made from 340 white bricks was built between the audience and the band during the first half of the show. The final brick was placed as Roger Waters sang \"goodbye\" at the end of the song \"Goodbye Cruel World\". For the second half of the show, the band was largely invisible, except for a hole in the wall that simulated a hotel room where Roger Waters \"acted out\" the story of Pink, and an appearance by David Gilmour on top of the wall to perform the climactic guitar solo in \"Comfortably Numb\". Other parts of the story were told by Gerald Scarfe animations projected onto the wall itself (these animations were later integrated into the film \"Pink Floyd: The Wall\"). At the finale of the concert, the wall was demolished amidst sound effects and a spectacular light show.\n\n\nThe earliest shows for what is considered to be \"Pink Floyd\" occurred in 1965 and included Bob Klose as a member of the band, which at the time played mainly R&B covers. Klose left the band after 1965. The remaining four members played very small (generally no more than 50 people), mostly unadvertised shows at the Marquee Club in London through June 1966. The set list continued to include R&B, but some original psychedelia was also being introduced.\n\nOn 30 September 1966, Pink Floyd were invited to play All Saint's Church Hall to raise money for the nascent International Times newspaper, and quickly became the \"house band\". At these shows, the band began its use of visual effects and gradually stopped covering R&B. Word of these shows quickly spread in the London underground culture and soon the band became very well-attended and developed a cult following. On 23 December 1966, the first of the \"International Times\" associated gigs to be held at the UFO Club was performed. Mainstream interest about the counter-culture was increasing and a very small portion of their 20 January 1967 show at the UFO Club was broadcast as part of Granada TV's documentary entitled \"It's So Far Out, It's Straight Down\", which constitutes the first audial or visual record of the band live.\n\nPink Floyd were among the 30 bands that played The 14 Hour Technicolour Dream benefit gig organised for the \"International Times\" legal defence fund and held at the Alexandra Palace in London on the eve of 30 April 1967. Some of the other bands who played were The Who, The Move, The Pretty Things, Soft Machine, Tomorrow and The Creation. Notables in attendance included musician John Lennon, artist John Dunbar, actor Michael Caine, artist and musician Yoko Ono, actress Julie Christie, musician Mick Jagger and artist David Hockney. Although both the BBC and filmmaker Peter Whitehead filmed portions of the event, there is no known footage of Pink Floyd.\n\nOn 12 May 1967, Pink Floyd performed at Queen Elizabeth Hall in London a concert entitled Games for May. At this show, they debuted a multi-speaker pan pot system controlled by joystick from the stage that allowed them to move sound to anywhere a speaker had been set up. This precursor to their later \"Azimuth Coordinator\" unfortunately was stolen after the show.\n\nAfter their debut single, \"Arnold Layne\", charted well in the UK, the band was invited to perform on the BBC2 music show \"The Look of the Week\" on 14 May 1967. The setlist for the broadcast consisted of \"Pow R. Toc H.\" and \"Astronomy Domine\". This was their first British television appearance.\n\nPink Floyd were invited to appear on the BBC2 music show \"Top of the Pops\" in July 1967 for three weeks after their second single \"See Emily Play\" reached #6 on the UK charts. By this time Syd Barrett's behavior had become somewhat unpredictable. On one occasion, the increasingly difficult Barrett remarked that if John Lennon did not have to appear on \"Top of the Pops\" neither did he. Consequently, their management company, Blackhill Enterprises, convinced the band to cancel all of their August shows and go to Spain to recuperate.\n\nIncreasingly, throughout the summer and into the fall of 1967, copious drug use (especially LSD) and pressure by the record company to constantly write new hit songs continued to take a toll on Barrett's mental state. He became unable to make a meaningful contribution to the group on stage, playing his guitar incoherently and sometimes not playing at all. By the time of the band's first tour of the US in early November 1967, his condition was plainly showing. He stared blankly into space on their 4 November \"American Bandstand\" performance, listlessly strummed and barely managed to mime the vocals to \"Apples and Oranges\". On 5 November, things got worse: they appeared on \"The Pat Boone Show\" and Syd sat in stubborn silence, refusing to answer any question put to him. He also refused to mime to \"See Emily Play\": Waters was forced to mime the track instead (Waters confirmed this on the \"VH1's Legends: Pink Floyd\" episode). After the 22 December show, the rest of band quietly put out word that they were in need of a guitarist.\n\nAlthough both Jeff Beck and Davy O'List were considered, it was David Gilmour, then unobligated, who was brought on to augment Syd as need arose during live shows. For the first four shows of 1968, Pink Floyd was a five-man live act again. When they were on the way to their show at Southampton University on 26 January 1968, they decided not to pick up Syd.\n\n\"See: Pink Floyd World Tour 1968\"\n\nA typical 1968 set list would include some of the following:\n\nAlthough their management company Blackhill Enterprises parted ways with them over their decision about Syd Barrett on 29 June 1968, Pink Floyd headlined the first free Hyde Park concert organized by Blackhill. Others performing were Tyrannosaurus Rex, Roy Harper and Jethro Tull.\n\nA second tour of the US during July and August 1968 (see A Saucerful of Secrets US Tour) was launched to tie into the release of their second album, \"A Saucerful of Secrets\". Increasingly throughout 1968 and 1969, shows consisted of post-Barrett compositions, with notable exceptions being \"Astronomy Domine\" and \"Interstellar Overdrive\", both of which were performed into the 1970s. Their audiences changed during this time as well: while Barrett-era crowds consisted mainly of hippies who would dance in time with the music, they now drew more \"intellectual\" crowd, who would sit and remain quiet until the last note of a song was played. By early 1969, most of their excess earnings were funneled into upgrading their sound equipment rather than maintaining a permanent light show. If visuals were to be used at all, they had to be provided by the venue or the local promoter.\n\nA typical 1969 set list would include some of the following:\n\n\"See: The Man And The Journey Tour\"\n\n\nThe shows at Mothers, Birmingham on 27 April 1969 and the College of Commerce, Manchester on 2 May 1969 were recorded for the live part of the Ummagumma album. One source also claims that the show at Bromley Technical College on 26 April 1969 was also recorded for the album.\n\nOn 14 April 1969, at Royal Festival Hall, they debuted their new pan pot 360 degree sound system dubbed the \"Azimuth Coordinator\". This show, named \"More Furious Madness from the Massed Gadgets of Auximenes\", consisted of two experimental \"suites\", \"The Man\" and \"The Journey\". Most of the songs were either renamed earlier material or under a different name than they would eventually be released.\n\nA UK tour of occurred during May and June 1969 culminating in the show dubbed \"The Final Lunacy\" at Royal Albert Hall on 26 June 1969. Considered one of the most experimental concerts by Pink Floyd, it featured a crew member dressed as a gorilla, a cannon that fired, and band members sawing wood on the stage. At the finale of \"The Journey\" suite the band was joined on stage by the brass section of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the ladies of the Ealing Central Amateur Choir, and at the very end a huge pink smoke bomb was let off.\n\nAn additional complete performance of \"The Man/The Journey\" occurred at the Concertgebouw, Amsterdam on 17 September and was taped and later broadcast by Dutch radio station Hilversum 3. Portions of the suites were being performed as late as early 1970.\n\nA typical 1970 set list would include some of the following:\n\nEarly in 1970, Pink Floyd performed at gigs a piece from their film soundtrack for Michelangelo Antonioni's film \"Zabriskie Point\" referred to as \"The Violent Sequence\". This was the musical basis for \"Us and Them\", from their \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" album. Lacking only the lyrics, it is identical to the final song and is the earliest part of the seminal album to have been performed live. The song \"Embryo\" was also a part of the live repertoire around this time, but was never to appear on a studio album, until the compilation album \"Works\".\n\nOn 18 January 1970 (possibly 17 January 1970), the band began performing a then untitled instrumental piece, which would eventually become the title track to their next album \"Atom Heart Mother\". At this point, it had no orchestra or choir accompaniment. The song officially debuted at the Bath Festival, Somerset England on 27 June 1970 under the title \"The Amazing Pudding\" (later the name of a Pink Floyd fanzine) and for the first time with orchestra and choir accompaniment.\n\nAnnounced as \"The Atom Heart Mother\" by the British broadcaster John Peel on his BBC Radio 1 show \"Peel's Sunday Concert\" on 16 July 1970, a name suggested by him to the band, it was also announced as \"The Atomic Heart Mother\" two days later at the Hyde Park free concert. Partly because of the difficulties of finding and hiring local orchestras and choirs, the band often played what is referred to as the \"small band\" version of the song when they performed it live.\n\nOn 28 June 1970 Fink Floyd was the end-performance of the Kralingen Music Festival or \"Stamping Ground\" in a park near Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nPink Floyd also appeared at a Free festival In Canterbury on August 31 which was filmed. This was the end leg of the Medicine Ball Caravan tour organised by Warner Brothers, which was later made into a film of the same name. It appears that the Pink Floyd footage was not included in the movie but spectators report that Atom Heart Mother was part of the set that was recorded. The audience must have been one of the smallest to see Pink Floyd at this era, only 1500 were present as the festival was not widely promoted.\n\nIn contrast, over 500,000 people witnessed their show at Fête de L'Humanité, Paris on 12 September 1970, their largest crowd ever. Filmed by French TV, the show was never broadcast.\n\nExperimental on the album \"Atom Heart Mother\", the song \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\" was performed at a few gigs in December 1970. \"Breakfast\" being made was part of the song. The first part of this lasted around four minutes. The second part of \"breakfast\" preparation was around a minute followed by a 3-minute tape of British DJ Jimmy Young, whom the band disliked.\n\nFor a great recording of some of their material from this period check out the Fillmore West show in San Francisco, California on 29 April 1970 on Wolfgang's Vault. This show includes material from \"Ummagumma\" and \"Atom Heart Mother\".\n\nA typical 1971 set list would include some of the following:\n\nJanuary 1971 saw the band working on a track in the studio of then unconnected parts whose working title was either \"Nothing — Parts 1 to 24\" or \"Nothing Parts 1–36\". This song made its live debut under the working title \"Return of the Son of Nothing\" on 22 April 1971 at Norwich, England and like \"Atom Heart Mother\" before it, it was a work in progress. This was later to be released as \"Echoes\" on the album \"Meddle\".\n\nAlthough announced as \"Echoes\" on 6 August 1971 at Hakone, Japan, the song was still performed with the additional lyrics at later August gigs. The show on 18 September 1971 at Montreux, Switzerland and subsequent shows do not have the additional lyrics. In 1972, during a German tour, Waters sardonically introduced Echoes as \"Looking Through the Knotholes in Granny's Wooden Leg\" (a Goon Show reference) on one occasion and \"The March of the Dam Busters\" on another. On another occasion, during a live radio broadcast, Waters had instructed the DJ to announce \"One of These Days\" to the home audience as \"A poignant appraisal of the contemporary social situation.\"\n\nAfter the band's Crystal Palace Garden Party performance (London, 15 May 1971), it was discovered that the sheer volume of the gig caused the nearby pond's entire fauna to die. The band was subsequently pressured to compensate for the ecological damage.\n\nA typical 1972 set list included:\n\nFirst Set:\n\nSecond Set:\n\nEncore:<br>\n\"Rotated one of these three songs:\"\n\"Occasionally, multiple song encores were performed, adding:\"\n\nPlaying 98 shows (the most until 1994), 1972 was the last time Pink Floyd varied their set lists each night on a tour until their final one. Songs played in the second set and encore were swapped constantly, and the band even varied the number of songs played in the encore from the usual one, to two or three.\n\n1972 saw Pink Floyd debut the performance of a not just a song (like on previous tours), but an entire album prior to its release. The original title was \"Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics)\", then \"The Dark Side of the Moon - A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\", the name under which it made its press debut in February 1972 at London's Rainbow Theatre. The title changed for the first part of the US tour to \"Eclipse (A Piece for Assorted Lunatics)\" during April and May before reverting to \"Dark Side of the Moon - A Piece for Assorted Lunatics\" in September for the second part of the US tour and finally released in 1973 under the title of \"Dark Side of the Moon\".\n\nOne of the two shows at The Dome, Brighton, England on 28 June and 29 June was filmed by Peter Clifton for inclusion on his film \"Sounds of the City\". Clips of these appear occasionally on television and the performance of \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" is on the various artists video \"Superstars in Concert\".\n\nIn November 1972, during the middle of the European leg of their 1972 world tour and again in January 1973, Pink Floyd performed with the Roland Petit Ballet. The portion of the setlist for which the ballet was choreographed was \"One of These Days\", \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\", \"Obscured by Clouds\", \"When You're In\" and \"Echoes\".\n\nAn early 1973 set list (until mid-March) included:\n\nFirst Set:\nSecond Set:<br>\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" entire album<br>\nEncore:\n\nFor remainder of 1973 (except 4 November), the set list included:\n\nFirst Set:\nSecond Set: <br>\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" entire album<br>\nEncore:\n\nIn 1973, the band moved \"Dark Side of the Moon\" to the second set (where it would reside through 1975), and played the album version of the piece, notably the revamped versions of \"On the Run\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\" 1973 saw Pink Floyd go on two relatively short tours of the US, one in March to coincide with the release of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and a later one in June. Sandwiched between them were two nights at London's Earl's Court on 18 May and 19 May where they debuted the special effect of a plane crashing into the stage at the end of the song \"On the Run\". This was also the first year that the band took additional musicians on tour with them, unlike the earlier performances of \"Atom Heart Mother\" where the band would often hire local musicians.\n\nBecause of the overwhelming chart success of both \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", which reached #1 in the US in late April, #2 in the UK, and the US-released single \"Money\", the nature of Pink Floyd's audiences changed in June 1973. David Gilmour said of the change \"It was 'Money' that made the difference rather than 'The Dark Side of the Moon'. It gave us a much larger following, for which we should be thankful. ... People at the front shouting, 'Play Money! Gimme something I can shake my ass to!' We had to get used to it, but previously we'd been playing to 10,000 seaters where, in the quiet passages, you could hear a pin drop.\" They could now sell out stadiums.\n\nOn 4 November 1973, Pink Floyd played two shows at London's Rainbow Theatre to benefit musician Robert Wyatt formerly the drummer of Soft Machine, a band they'd played with in their UFO Club days. Wyatt fell from a fourth floor window in June 1973, breaking his back and making him a paraplegic. The set list for these two shows were:\n\nMain Set:<br>\n\"The Dark Side of the Moon\" entire album<br>\nEncore:\n\nA French Summer Tour set list would include all of the following:\nEncore (one of the following):\n\nA British Summer Tour set list included all of the following:\nEncore:\n\nThese early versions of \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", \"Raving and Drooling\" & \"You've Got to be Crazy\" were released as part of the Wish You Were Here Experience and Immersion sets.\n\nA typical 1975 set would include all of the following:\n\nEncore:\n\nIn 1975, the band launched a short tour that ended two months prior to the release of \"Wish You Were Here\", which eventually sold out stadiums and arenas across America.\n\nThe last gig of the tour was as the headliner of 1975 Knebworth Festival, which also featured The Steve Miller Band, Captain Beefheart and Roy Harper (who joined Pink Floyd on the stage to sing \"Have a Cigar\"). It was the second Knebworth Festival, which featured artists such as The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Genesis and Frank Zappa between 1974 and 1979.\n\nDespite some technical problems, the band managed to perform a remarkable concert, which as well as the usual special effects featured a fly-past by a pair of Spitfires. This was supposed to synchronise with the start of 'Breathe' but the band had tuning difficulties and the planes flew over before the start of the set. Knebworth was the last time the band would perform \"Echoes\" and the entire \"Dark Side of the Moon\" with Roger Waters.\n\nA typical 1977 set list would include the following:\nEncore:\n\nIn 1977, Pink Floyd embarked on a world tour in support of the \"Animals\" album. Although the album had not sold as well as their two previous releases, \"Dark Side Of The Moon\" and \"Wish You Were Here\", the band's popularity was at an all-time high. The band managed to sell out arenas and stadiums in both Europe and America, setting attendance records all along the way. In Chicago, the band played to an estimated audience of 95,000; in Cleveland and Montreal, they set attendance records for those venues by playing to over 80,000 people. The \"In The Flesh\" tour would later become widely known as their most memorable series of concert performances, and the last in which Roger Waters would accompany the band. The elaborate stage presentations, particularly those constructed for the outdoor venues, were their most complex and elaborate to date. Designed by Mark Fisher and Andrew Sanders, they featured a pyrotechnic \"waterfall\", umbrella-like canopies that could be deployed to protect the band from the elements, and a variety of characters associated with the \"Animals\" album; including \"Algie\", a 40-foot long inflatable pig that drifted out over the audience, the \"Average American family\" (which, at the time, included Mom, Dad and 2.5 children), and paper sheep that parachuted down on the crowds after being shot from cannons mounted to the sides of the stage. The musicians that accompanied the band on the tour included veteran saxophone player Dick Parry (occasionally playing keyboards as well) and guitarist Snowy White, who also filled in on bass guitar for some songs.\n\nIn the first half of each show, the band played all of the songs from \"Animals\", but in a slightly different sequence than the album (typically starting with \"Sheep\", then \"Pigs On the Wing (Part 1)\", \"Dogs\", \"Pigs On the Wing (Part 2) and \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\"). The second half of the shows consisted of \"Wish You Were Here\" being played in its exact running order (\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 1-5)\", \"Welcome to the Machine\", \"Have a Cigar\", \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts 6-9)\"). The encores would usually consist of either \"Money\" or \"Us and Them\" from \"Dark Side of the Moon\" or both. At the Oakland, California show on May 9, they played \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" as a third encore, the last time the song was ever performed live.\n\nThe tour started in Dortmund, West Germany on January 23 and proceeded through Europe, ending in Stafford, England on March 31. Three weeks later, the North American leg of the tour opened in Miami, Florida on April 22, concluding in Montreal, Quebec on July 6. The show in Oakland, California on May 9 is widely regarded as one of the band's finest performances ever. During \"Have a Cigar,\" Waters and Gilmour can be heard laughing as they sing part of the opening line. In the run-up to the band's four-night run at Madison Square Garden in New York City (July 1–4), tour promoters used an aggressive marketing strategy, filling pages of The New York Times and Billboard magazine with ads. In May, there was a Pink Floyd parade on 6th Avenue featuring both inflatable and live animals.\n\nAnother memorable performance occurred in Cleveland, Ohio on June 25. The show was held at Cleveland Municipal Stadium, just a short distance from Burke Lakefront Airport. Most of the shows opened with a recording of jet airplane taking off, but promoters secretly arranged for the band's Boeing 737 jet to do a low flyover directly over the stadium as the show opened. The FAA later fined the promoters $1,500 over the incident. The show was also delayed briefly by a fan that grabbed the tether line for the inflatable pig and wouldn't release it. At their performance in Boston two nights later, Waters jokingly said \"We're going to take a PIG break, back in 20 minutes\". He closed the show by gratefully commenting that this had been \"the perfect end to the perfect day, good night and God bless\".\n\nAs the tour began, everyone was in good spirits, but the later shows were marred by Roger Waters' increasing annoyance with the raucous fans in attendance. During the last show in Montreal, a noisy fan near the stage irritated Waters to such an extent that he spat on him. The act so disgusted David Gilmour that he left the stage prior to the final encore, \"More Blues\", leaving Snowy White to fill in as the roadies began dismantling the stage equipment. The insatiable audience clamored for the band to keep playing, and a small riot broke out in front of the stage following the band's eventual exit. Later that night, Waters recounted the incident to his friend, music producer Bob Ezrin, and expressed his growing feelings of alienation toward their fans. Those feeling of detachment became the starting and focal point for Pink Floyd's next album, \"The Wall\".\n\nThe 1980/1981 set lists comprised the entire album, \"The Wall\".\n\nPink Floyd mounted its most elaborate stage show in conjunction with the tour of \"The Wall\". A band of session musicians played the first song, wearing rubber face masks taken from the real band members, then backed up the band for the remainder of the show. Most notable was the giant wall constructed between band and audience.\n\nThe costs of the tour were estimated to have reached US$1.5 million even before the first performance. The New York Times stated in its 2 March 1980 edition that:\n\nThe 'Wall' show remains a milestone in rock history though and there's no point in denying it. Never again will one be able to accept the technical clumsiness, distorted sound and meagre visuals of most arena rock concerts as inevitable\" and concluded that \"the 'Wall' show will be the touchstone against which all future rock spectacles must be measured. The show was designed by Mark Fisher with Art Direction by Gerald Scarfe.\n\n\"The Wall\" concert was only performed a handful of times each in four cities: Los Angeles, Uniondale (Long Island), Dortmund, and London (at Earl's Court). The primary 'tour' occurred in 1980, but the band performed eight shows at Dortmund (14–20 February 1981) and five more shows at Earl's Court (13–17 June) for filming, with the intention of integrating the shows into the upcoming movie. The resulting footage was deemed substandard and scrapped; years later, Roger Waters has given conflicted answers on the status of the concert films stating from \"trying to locate this footage for historical purposes but was unsuccessful and considers it to be lost forever\" to \"I have all of the film but am reluctant to release\". There are several unofficial videos of the entire live show in circulation and some footage is shown on the \"Behind the Wall\" documentary.\n\nGilmour and Mason attempted to convince Waters to expand the show for a more lucrative, large-scale stadium tour, but because of the nature of the material (one of the primary themes is the distance between an artist and his audience) Waters balked at this. In fact, Waters had reportedly been offered a guaranteed US$1 million for each additional stadium concert, but declined the offer, insisting that such a tour would be hypocritical.\n\nThese shows are documented on the album \"Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81\".\n\nWaters recreated the \"Wall\" show in Berlin in 1990, alongside the ruins of the Berlin Wall, and was joined by a number of guest artists (including Bryan Adams, Scorpions, Van Morrison, The Band, Tim Curry, Cyndi Lauper, Sinéad O'Connor, Marianne Faithfull, Joni Mitchell, Ute Lemper and Thomas Dolby). This concert was even bigger than the previous ones, as Waters built a long and high wall. The size of the theatrical features of \"The Wall\" were increased to cater for a sold-out audience of 200,000 people and of another estimated 500 million, in 35 countries, watching on television. After the concert began, the gates were opened and an estimated 300,000 to 500,000 people were able to watch the concert. This show is available on \"The Wall Live in Berlin\" album and DVD.\n\nRoger staged another tour of \"The Wall\" in 2010 saying of the story \"it has occurred to me that maybe the story of my fear and loss with its concomitant inevitable residue of ridicule, shame and punishment, provides an allegory for broader concerns.: Nationalism, racism, sexism, religion, Whatever! All these issues and ‘isms are driven by the same fears that drove my young life.\"\n\nAfter the release of \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" in 1987, Pink Floyd embarked on an 11-week tour to promote the album. The two remaining members of the band, David Gilmour and Nick Mason, along with Richard Wright, had just won a legal battle against Roger Waters and the future of the group was uncertain. Having the success of \"The Wall\" shows to live up to, the concerts' special effects were more impressive than ever. The initial \"promotional tour\" was extended, and finally lasted almost two years, ending in 1989 after playing around 200 concerts to about 5.5 million people in total, including 3 dates at Madison Square Garden (5–7 October 1987) and 2 nights at Wembley Stadium (5–6 August 1988). The tour took Pink Floyd to various exotic locations they had never played before such as shows in the forecourt of the Palace of Versailles, Moscow's Olympic Stadium, and Venice, despite fears and protests that the sound would damage the latter city's foundations.\n\nThese shows are documented by the \"Delicate Sound of Thunder\" album and video.\n\nPink Floyd was the second highest grossing act of 1987 and the highest grossing of 1988 in the U.S. Financially, Pink Floyd was the biggest act of these two years combined, grossing almost US$60 million from touring, about the same as U2 and Michael Jackson, their closest rivals, combined. Worldwide, the band grossed around US$135 million.\n\nThe tour marked the first time that the band played in Russia, Norway, Spain, New Zealand and was the first time they had played in Australia since 1973.\n\nA further concert was held at the Knebworth Festival in 1990, a charity event that also featured other Silver Clef Award winners. Pink Floyd was the last act to play, to an audience of 125,000. During this gig Clare Torry sang backing vocals making it the second and last time she did so. Vicki and Sam Brown also attended as backing vocalists, as well as Candy Dulfer with saxophone solo. The £60,000 firework display that ended the concert was entirely financed by the band.\n\nThe Division Bell Tour in 1994 was promoted by Canadian concert impresario Michael Cohl and became the highest-grossing tour in rock music history to that date, with the band playing the entirety of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" in some shows, for the first time since 1975.\n\nThe concerts featured more elaborate special effects than the previous tour, including two custom designed airships. The arch-shaped stage was designed by Marc Brickman and Mark Fisher with lighting by Marc Brickman. Three stages leapfrogged around North America and Europe, each long and featuring a arch modelled on the Hollywood Bowl. All in all, the tour required 700 tons of steel carried by 53 articulated trucks, a crew of 161 people and an initial investment of US$4 million plus US$25 million of running costs just to stage. This tour played to 5.5 million people in 68 cities; each concert gathered an average 45,000 audience. At the end of the year, the Division Bell Tour was announced as the biggest tour ever, with worldwide gross of over £150 million (about US$250 million). In the U.S. alone, it grossed US$103.5 million from 59 concerts. However, this record was short-lived; less than a year later, The Rolling Stones' Voodoo Lounge Tour (like the Division Bell Tour, also sponsored in part by Volkswagen) finished with a worldwide gross of over US$300 million. The Stones and U2 (with their Vertigo Tour) remain the only acts ever to achieve a higher worldwide gross from a tour, even when adjusting for inflation.\n\nThese shows are documented by the Pulse \"album\" and \"DVD\".\n\nIn 1996, Gilmour and Wright performed \"Wish You Were Here\" with Billy Corgan (of The Smashing Pumpkins fame) at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction.\n\nIn an interview with BBC Radio 2 in October, 2001, Gilmour implied that the \"\" compilation (released in November 2001) \"probably\" signaled the end of the band. \"You never know exactly what the future (holds)\", Gilmour said. \"I'm not going to slam any doors too firmly, but I don't see myself doing any more of that, and I certainly don't see myself going out on a big Floyd tour again.\" A few days later in an interview with Launch.com, Nick Mason contradicted the statement, saying \"I don't feel I've retired yet. You know, if everyone wanted to, we could certainly still do something. I've spent 30 years waiting for the planets to align. I'm quite used to it.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour released a solo concert DVD called \"David Gilmour in Concert\" in November 2002 which was compiled from shows on 22 June 2001 and 17 January 2002 at The Royal Festival Hall in London. Richard Wright, Robert Wyatt, and Bob Geldof (Pink in \"The Wall\" film) make guest appearances.\n\nLongtime manager Steve O'Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed \"Fat Old Sun\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" at his funeral at Chichester Cathedral, contrary to reports in the media claiming they played \"Wish You Were Here\".\n\nOn 2 July 2005 Pink Floyd performed at the London Live 8 concert with Roger Waters rejoining David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright. It was the quartet's first performance together in over 24 years — the band's last show with Waters was at Earls Court in London on 17 June 1981.\n\nGilmour announced the Live 8 reunion on 12 June 2005:\n\nThe band's set consisted of \"Speak to Me/Breathe/Breathe (Reprise)\", \"Money\", \"Wish You Were Here\", and \"Comfortably Numb\". As on the original recordings, Gilmour sang the lead vocals on \"Breathe\" and \"Money\", and shared them with Waters on \"Comfortably Numb\". For \"Wish You Were Here\", Waters sung half of the verse's lyrics, unlike the original recording. When Waters was not singing, he was often enthusiastically mouthing the lyrics off-microphone. During the guitar introduction of \"Wish You Were Here\", Waters said:\n\nThey were augmented by guitarist/bassist Tim Renwick (guitarist on Roger Waters' 1984 solo tour, who has since become Pink Floyd's backing guitarist on stage); keyboardist/lap steel guitarist/backup vocalist Jon Carin (Pink Floyd's backing keyboardist from 1987 onward who performed on the 1999–2000 North American leg of Waters' \"In the Flesh\" tour, his 2006–2008 \"Dark Side of the Moon Live\" tour, his 2010–2011 \"The Wall\" tour and David Gilmour's 2006 On an Island tour); saxophonist Dick Parry during \"Money\" (who played on the original recordings of \"Money\", \"Us and Them\", and \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\"); and backing singer Carol Kenyon during \"Comfortably Numb\". During \"Breathe\", on the screen behind them, film of the iconic pig from the \"Animals\" album was shown flying over Battersea Power Station (itself visible on the horizon in television broadcasts of the performance), and during \"Money\", a shot of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" record being played was shown. During \"Comfortably Numb\", the three giant screens showed the Pink Floyd Wall (from the cover of \"The Wall\"), and during the final guitar solo, the words \"Make Poverty History\" were written on the wall.\n\nAt the end, after the last song had been played, Gilmour said \"thank you very much, good night\" and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous pictures of Live 8. As they proceeded to walk off, Nick Mason threw his drumsticks into the audience. With Wright's subsequent death, in September 2008, this was to be the final concert to feature all four bandmates playing together.\n\nOn 10 May 2007 the sans-Waters Pink Floyd (presented as Rick Wright, David Gilmour and Nick Mason) took part in a Syd Barrett tribute concert in London performing \"Arnold Layne\", and Roger Waters performed \"Flickering Flame\".\n\n\"See: Pink Floyd live backing musicians\"\n\nBecause of the increasingly complex nature of Pink Floyd's music, more and more musicians besides the band were required on stage to recreate sounds achieved in the studio. Some performances of \"Atom Heart Mother\" featured an entire orchestra and choir, reputedly a nightmare to bring on tour. Less 'weighty' contributions from other musicians followed. In 1973 Dick Parry provided saxophone for \"Dark Side of the Moon\" and reprised this for live performances in every subsequent tour except those promoting \"The Wall\" and \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\", the latter in which Scott Page provided sax. For 1977's \"Animals\" promotion, Snowy White was brought in as an additional guitarist. He returned for \"The Wall\" shows along with a complete \"surrogate band\" consisting of Peter Wood (keyboards), Willie Wilson (drums) and Andy Bown (bass). Andy Roberts replaced White for the 1981 shows. For the \"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\" and \"Division Bell\" tours, Jon Carin (whom David Gilmour had met at Live Aid playing in Bryan Ferry's backing band) provided additional synthesizers and keyboards, Guy Pratt replaced Roger Waters on bass, Tim Renwick provided additional guitar and Gary Wallis additional percussion. Several backing vocalists, (the most notable of whom are Rachel Fury, Clare Torry, Sam Brown, Margaret Taylor, Durga McBroom and Carol Kenyon) have accompanied the band on and off from \"Dark Side of the Moon\" onwards. During their performance at Live 8, Pink Floyd used Tim Renwick, Jon Carin, Dick Parry and Carol Kenyon.\n\n\n"}

Its official title was \"\", the \"Imperial and Royal Court Theater of Vienna\".\n\nThe theater was built in 1709 to designs by Antonio Beduzzi on a site near the former Kärntnertor, on the grounds of the present Hotel Sacher. The expenses of building the theater were borne by the City of Vienna, and was intended (as Eva Badura-Skoda notes) to be \"frequented by the Viennese population of all classes.\" However, at the command of the Emperor, the first performances were of Italian opera, an elite form of entertainment. In 1711 the theater was redirected to its original purpose when it was placed under the direction of , who put on a variety of entertainments, often embodying a German version of the Italian commedia dell'arte. The theater was managed by Stranitzky's widow after his death.\n\nIn 1728 the court artists Borosini and Selliers, who had performed intermezzi in both German and Italian, became the Kärntnertortheater's directors. From 1742 to 1750 the theatre was leased to Selliers alone. In 1752, however, Maria Theresa withdrew the imperial privilege, placing the theater under the direct scrutiny of the magistrates of Vienna.\n\nThe first theatre burned in 1761 and was rebuilt by the court architect Nicolò Pacassi; two years later it reopened, again under protective privilege, as the ', \"Imperial and Royal Court Theater of Vienna\". From the early nineteenth century ballets were added to the repertory, as well as Italian and German operas. From 1811 to 1814 Ignaz Franz Castelli served as \"Hoftheaterdichter\", \"poet of the court theater\". From 1821 the Italian impresario Domenico Barbaia added the theatre to the string of theatres under his management, and presented Italian operas. Beginning in 1861 the Vienna Court Opera House (now the Vienna State Opera) was built on the adjoining grounds; it was completed in 1869 and in 1870 the former theatre was razed, making way for the apartment building that became the Hotel Sacher. Gerhard Bronner's cabaret showcase used the name ' (New Theatre at the Kärntnertor) from 1959 to 1973 before adopting its present name; it is located on the next block at 4 Walfischgasse.\n\nDuring its heyday several composers conducted the theatre orchestra, including the young Franz Lachner and Ferdinando Paer.\n\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n"}

The originating event, YC Alberta, is held in Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. YC is a ministry of Extreme Dream Ministries.\n\nYC is unique from other Christians music festivals in that attendees buy tickets to attend all main speakers and concerts, not just the ones they choose.\n\nYC Weekend is typically scheduled to take place for 3 days on may long weekend each year.\n\nYC was organized by the Alberta district of the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada (PAOC). The first YC was held in 1994, with a group of 500 students. After being held for several years at the Centrium in Red Deer, Alberta, the conference outgrew the facilities and moved to Edmonton Coliseum in 2000. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, it had a record attendance of around 18000 people. 2014 was the 20th anniversary of YC. In remembrance of the anniversary, the mayor of the city of Edmonton (Don Iveson), proclaimed \"YC Days\". Thus means every year, the weekend that YC is on, it is YC days.\n\nIn 2005 YC branched out to hold an event in Ukraine, which was very successful. YC is still expanding, with an event held each year in Winnipeg, St. John's, Newfoundland, Belize and Slovakia.\n\nEach year, YC has a different \"theme\" that expresses what organizers wish attendees to focus on during the weekend, which starts on Friday, goes through Saturday, and ends Sunday evening.\n\nOn Friday, YC kicks off in Northlands Coliseum, usually with a light and fireworks show. Then comes a contemporary worship service, followed by a speaker. Then the evening ends with a concert.\n\nOn Saturday morning, there is another worship service, after which two speakers present. At noon, the attendees are released to eat lunch, and browse the many afternoon activities YC offers, like workshops, numerous concerts, indoor games, exhibitors, and a marketplace.

When the 2005 conference came to a close, Rob Bedard, the YC Fusion Director announced his position was ending which led to the announcement of Extreme Dreams Ministries future role in the conference.

As such they generally depend on banks (creditors) for their continued existence, effectively putting them on never-ending life support.\n\nThe term \"zombie company\" was applied to Japanese firms supported by Japanese banks during the period known as the \"Lost Decade\" after the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble in c.1990. Japanese banks continued to support weak or failing firms. The retailer Daiei is an example of a large company that expanded greatly during the period leading to the 1990 crash, and under different circumstances would have been expected to have entered receivership or bankruptcy. The finance minister Takeo Hiranuma was reported as describing the 96,000 employee firm as being 'too big to fail'.\n\nThe term regained popularity in the media during 2008 for companies receiving bailouts from the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).\n\nBy 2016 following economic downturn in China (see also 2015–16 Chinese stock market crash) Chinese industrial companies (steel, aluminium, paper etc) had developed gross overproduction capacity problems, with overcapacity rising from 0% in 2007 to an average of 13% by 2015, with figures higher than 30% in some industries (cement, steel in 2014). At the 2016 National People's Congress the country's government recognised the issue of the 'Zombie Enterprises' and announced that it was to close or reorganise many state owned (public) industrial companies by 2020. In coal and steel industries resultant loss of work was expected to result in 1.8 million redundancies (15% of workforce), with total redundancies estimated to be up to 6 million workers.\n\n"}
