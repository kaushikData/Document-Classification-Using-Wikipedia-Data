Two people died in the ensuing violence, and the government then ordered the Yugoslav People's Army onto the city streets. The police detained several prominent SPO officials and banned two media outlets considered unfriendly to the government. The protests are referred to in Serbian as ', i.e. the March 9 protest, after this initial event.\n\nThe next day, in reaction to the events of the previous day, more protests drew large and diverse crowds, including leaders of the Democratic Party (DS), with some referring to it as a \"Velvet Revolution\". The next day still, the government supporters responded by organizing a counter-rally of their own. The protests ended on March 14 as the leaders of SPO were released from police custody. The government replaced the director of the state TV as well as the Minister of the Interior.\n\nBeset by a multitude of political and economic issues, Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia still existed in March 1991, with Socialist Republic of Serbia as its biggest and most populous constituent part. Multi-party political system had been introduced less than a year earlier, in 1990, meaning that instead of the Communist League's (SKJ) Serbian branch (SKS) that exclusively ruled for 45 years, Serbia's political landscape was once again, for the first time since the early 1940s, dotted with many parties.\n\nHowever, only three parties could boast any kind of actual significance: Slobodan Milošević's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS), Drašković's Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), and Democratic Party (DS) led at the time by Dragoljub Mićunović and featuring high-ranking members Zoran Đinđić and Vojislav Koštunica who would both later rise to greater prominence.\n\nIn addition to political turbulence in each of the country's six constituent republics, the security situation in SFR Yugoslavia was deteriorating as well. Incidents were especially frequent in the Socialist Republic of Croatia where the two constituent ethnic groups — Croats and Serbs — began clashing following the May 1990 election victory of the right-wing nationalist Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) that pursued secessionism from the Yugoslav federation, a policy which the Serbs protested and actively obstructed by engaging in a series of actions collectively termed the Log Revolution. By spring 1991, the situation in SR Croatia got extremely tense, and just days before the March 9 protest in Belgrade, the incident in Pakrac occurred.\n\nMeanwhile, in SR Serbia, Milošević firmly controlled all the pillars of power: he himself was the President of the Republic; his party SPS, thanks to its huge parliamentary majority (194 seats out of 250), easily formed a stable government headed by prime minister Dragutin Zelenović (former communist apparatchik, at that moment extremely loyal to Milošević). Additionally, through party-installed people like the Radio Television Belgrade general-director Dušan Mitević, Milošević had a tight grip on the most important and influential media outlets, often using them for his own ends, although still not as blatantly and brazenly as he would later throughout the 1990s once the wars and UN sanctions set in.\n\nOn the other hand, opposition led most prominently by SPO (19 parliamentary seats out of 250) and to a lesser extent DS (7 seats) was often plagued by internal squabbles, ego clashes, and low-level skullduggery.\n\nThough Drašković and SPO had already been engaged in the, often dirty and personal, political battle with Slobodan Milošević, his wife Mira Marković, and their allies within the Serbian administration, this antagonism particularly intensified following the joint parliamentary and presidential elections of December 9, 1990 where Milošević and Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) scored an overwhelming victory, but Drašković also had a notable showing with over 800,000 votes in the presidential race that made him the most significant opposition figure. Since their access to state-controlled media, either print or electronic, was fairly limited, Drašković and his party frequently criticized and ridiculed Serbian leadership through the SPO-published weekly magazine \"Srpska reč\", edited by his wife Danica. One of the issues in February 1991 depicted Mira Marković with a Stalin-like moustache and a headline \"Šta hoće generali\" (What Do Generals Want).\n\nThe administration's answer was an anti-SPO commentary read by TV Belgrade's journalist Slavko Budihna during central daily newscast \"Dnevnik 2\" on February 16, 1991. Among other things Budihna read: \nThe following day, February 17, the commentary got published in its entirety in that day's issue of \"Politika ekspres\" daily. Drašković's response to this blatant misuse of the media was to demand an immediate retraction, but several days later on February 19 TV Belgrade management, specifically its news division chief Predrag Vitas, turned him down explaining that \"retractions are issued only in the cases of dissemination of inaccurate information, but not for commentaries\". Determined not to let this go, the following day, February 20, Drašković issued a call to the streets for March 9 where the protesters would publicly demand the retraction of the original defamatory piece. From then on Drašković often referred to TV Belgrade in derisive terms as \"TV Bastille\":\nStill, while the immediate cause for demonstration was ostensibly specific and narrow, this protest also had a wider ideological aspect. From its very name \"Protest against red star\" over to numerous examples of royalist insignia among the crowds, Drašković was very much whipping up old Chetnik - Partisan issues that were at the time beginning to be talked about again publicly after almost 50 years.\n\nWhen SPO called the protest for March 9, DS was on the fence. Their relationship with SPO at the time was somewhat on the cool side because two of DS prominent figures, Kosta Čavoški (one of the 13 founders) and Nikola Milošević (high-ranking member), recently left the party to form their own and were now openly co-operating with SPO. On top of that, ideologically speaking, the two parties had very little in common other than their general anti-Milošević stance. And this protest initially was not clearly anti-Milošević as much as it was brought on by the feud SPO had with state TV.\n\nIn the end, no DS members were on the list of speakers but many individually still decided to show up at the protest.\n\nThe motives for the protest varied. It has been variously described as an anti-war protest, or as a protest against the confrontational policies of the SPS, particularly against their complete exclusion of the opposition from state politics.\n\nIn the days following Drašković's call to the streets, SPO reiterated its demand for the retraction of the controversial newscast commentary, but also formulated an official list of demands. They wanted the Serbian National Assembly, as an institution that founded TV Belgrade, to \"prohibit SPS and SK-PzJ from creating and conducting the television network's editorial and staff hiring policies\". They also wanted TV Belgrade's two channels to be \"non-partisan and accessible to all political parties in proportion to their size and voter strength\". Furthermore, they demanded resignations from the key TV Belgrade personnel — director Dušan Mitević, as well as four other editors and on-air personalities: Slavko Budihna, Predrag Vitas (head of the news division), Ivan Krivec, and Sergej Šestakov. And finally, they demanded \"cessation of the practice of obstructing the work of Studio B and Yutel\". Other opposition parties, including the Democratic Party (DS), People's Peasant Party (NSS), People's Radical Party (NRS), New Democracy (ND), Democratic Forum, and Liberal Party, joined and supported the set of demands.\n\nIn the days leading up to the protest Milošević seemed intent not to let it take place.\n\nOn Thursday, March 7, the city of Belgrade police branch issued a special junction banning the protest while citing \"the location and the time of day when the rally is scheduled as disruptive to the public order and unobstructed flow of traffic\". As an alternative, they suggested the wide open space at Ušće as location for the protest, but SPO immediately refused to move the protest location.\n\nSeeing that the gathering at the Republic Square would not be allowed by the police thus realizing the potential for street clashes, Drašković appeared interested in some kind of a last minute mediation attempt or indirect deal by having his SPO MPs call for an immediate parliamentary meeting. However, they were flatly rejected by the SPS majority. Finally, on March 8, just one day before the scheduled protest, SPO MPs demanded a personal meeting with Milošević in his cabinet, but this time Milošević didn't even dignify their request with a response.\n\nMilošević's administration appeared confident, even arrogant, about possessing enough means and support to stop the protest from taking place.\n\nMarch 9, 1991 was a pleasant, partly sunny, slightly windy Saturday in late winter. The protest was scheduled to take place at the Republic Square in Belgrade, a wide open area right in the city's downtown core. In the early morning, the square was already filled with a substantial crowd. The police presence was also heavy. Just after 10 a.m. the police (consisting of members from all over Serbia as well as the police reserve members) established control over most streets in the city centre and blocked major roads heading into Belgrade.\n\nThis led to numerous incidents throughout different parts of the city centre before the protest rally even started as the police tried, often brutally, to impede the stream of people heading to the square. Soon after, the battles started at the square itself as the police started using armoured vehicles, water cannons, and tear gas in an attempt to drive the protesters out of the square. Enraged protesters immediately began responding, some of them armed with sticks, traffic sign poles, crow bars or whatever else they could get their hands on. The crowd from the adjoining streets jeered the police, chanting angrily at them to \"go to Pakrac\" or to \"go to Kosovo\". Some of the others from the crowd that managed to get into the square made allusions to the Romanian Revolution of 1989 chanting \"alea alea Securitatea\" while calling Milošević a fascist.\n\nWhile battles and skirmishes were already taking place for more than an hour, mass bedlam started around 11:30 a.m. when a large crowd of protesters held in check up to that point near the Ruski car restaurant managed to break through the police cordon. Yelling \"Ustaše, Ustaše\" at the police, the protesters started moving further into the square near the monument while the police tried unsuccessfully to stop them with a water cannon.\n\nSimultaneously, the scheduled speakers, including Drašković, had trouble making it into the square. Along with his entourage consisting of some 200 SPO members, at little after 11:30 a.m. Drašković was being held at the intersection of November 29 Street and Vašingtonova Street, surrounded by the police cordon that didn't want to let them join the protesters at the Republic Square. He tried to reason with them, appealing with their chiefs to let him into the square \"in order to calm the crowd and prevent bloodshed\". Some 15 minutes later, the police let them through without much resistance.\n\nGetting into the square, the impressive crowd size probably surprised even Drašković himself as the entire area was literally flooded with people. Flanked by the individuals loyal to him (including several prominent members of the Belgrade underworld such as Đorđe \"Giška\" Božović and Aleksandar \"Knele\" Knežević who essentially acted as his bodyguards), Drašković climbed the Prince Mihailo Monument and attempted to address the large crowd using a megaphone.\n\nEstimates on the number of people in the crowd vary: under 70,000, around 100,000, or in excess of 150,000.\n\nRealizing very few could hear him, Drašković then decided to seek permission from nearby National Theater personnel to address the crowds from its balcony, which provided a nice view of the entire square.\n\nPermission was granted by then-director Vida Ognjenović (incidentally a prominent DS member), so Drašković took to the balcony and began a fiery speech often interrupted by thunderous applause:\n\nSerbia, may God give us the dawn of freedom in our homeland as well.\n\nI'm not going to tell you everything that has happened since this morning; we all broke through different police barriers and therein showed that no obstacle will stop us.\n\nI salute you, heroes!\n\nI said it a month ago - even when the bolsheviks didn't believe me - and I'll say it again right this moment: today, in front of our righteous Prince [referring to the statue of Prince Mihailo Obrenović that dominates the square, and especially in few moments when we start marching on TV Bastille, we will show Serbian heart and we will show Serbian persistence.\n\nUnfortunately, we have no other way!\n\nHeroes, I remind you of the words of our pan-Serbian patriarch of our pan-Serbian mind, vladika Njegoš: ‘Svak je rođen za po jednom mreti’. They've got until 3:30 p.m. to issue a retraction and tender resignations and if they do that we'll return here to this pan-Serb gathering of national unity. Because of the brutal police charge on the unarmed people we also demand that the Minister of the Interior resign at the very next parliamentary session.\n\nThe President of the Republic\" [Slobodan Milošević] \"has to weigh between two choices in front of him: on one end of the scale are your lives as well as lives of many policemen because I heard our boys seized a lot of automatic weaponry in fights with police today - on that scale there are so many lives, Serbia's freedom, honour, and peace - while on the other end of the scale there are only 5 resignations and 1 retraction.\n\nLet the President decide what he wants, I have made my choice: I will lead the charge on Television today, fully ready to die!\n\nHis last proclamation put the present police squadron (led by Milošević loyalist Radovan \"Badža\" Stojičić) in full alert mode. After Drašković finished, other people took the microphone, among them Milan Paroški, Žarko Jokanović, Leon Koen, Milan Komnenić, Borislav Mihajlović Mihiz etc. Dragoslav Bokan and Borislav Pekić were present in the crowd but did not hold a speech.\n\nAround noon, in the middle of Mihiz's speech, police moved into the square with tear gas and full blown battle began. However, overwhelmed and outnumbered by the crowd the police retreated while trying to keep the angry protesters in check with water cannons. The situation was deteriorating by the second, flower beds were being overturned and broken off into smaller pieces of concrete to be thrown onto police vehicles. Drašković did not seem fazed by scenes of violence below, and if anything was only spurring them on. At one point he even bizarrely yelled \"Juuuuuuriš\" (Chaaaaaarge) into the microphone the way a field general would at the scene of battle.\n\nThe protest then spilled into adjoining streets and squares and most of the downtown Belgrade soon resembled a war zone. By this time, the police managed to regroup and reinforce their numbers, and began responding and attacking a lot more forcefully.\n\nStill, for about seven hours the protesters almost controlled the city as the majority of the police was guarding the TV Belgrade building and Dedinje. According to sources, some 200 policemen and 180 security guards in addition to 200 television staffers with basic military training who were given AK-47s were guarding the television building.\n\nIn the afternoon, Drašković, along with a large group of protesters, unsuccessfully attempted to storm the National Assembly of Serbia session. As he exited the building, he was arrested along with SPO deputy president Jovan Marjanović. Among the policemen handling Drašković's arrest was Naser Orić.\n\nSerbian President Slobodan Milošević demanded that the Presidency of Yugoslavia deploys troops of the Yugoslav People's Army to suppress the protest.\nBorisav Jović contacted other members of the Presidency by phone and the Army was indeed deployed, but the Slovenians later claimed the move was made unconstitutionally.\n\nIn the evening, Milošević took to the public airwaves to address the nation. While not mentioning anyone by name he characterized the day's events as being orchestrated by \"forces of chaos and madness threatening to restore everything that the people of Serbia rose against half a century ago\".\n\nTanks and armored cars rolled onto the streets.\n\nRadio B92 and Studio B television were banned and stopped broadcasting. Additionally, 203 protesters were injured and further 108 were arrested on March 9.\n\n636 people were arrested following the protest.\n\nThe protest claimed two lives. On March 9 around 3:30pm while running away from the crowd of protesters in Masarikova Street near Beograđanka, 54-year-old policeman Nedeljko Kosović died from repeated blows to the head.\n\nLater in the day, 17-year-old protester Branivoje Milinović was killed by a stray bullet. The circumstances of his death are conflicting as some reports claim he died as the crowd was storming the SR Serbia parliament building while others say he was killed by a rubber bullet when a group of policemen on the corner of Admirala Geprata Street and Kneza Miloša street opened fire in the direction of protesters in front of London Cafe. The investigation into his death was recently reopened.\n\nThe next day, March 10, Belgrade awoke to the anti-opposition headline \"Rušilački pohod\" (Destructive Crusade) on the front page of \"Politika\", the most important of the four dailies being published in the city at the time. Edited by the Milošević loyalist Žika Minović, the rest of that day's issue was not much different — of the 51 total pieces about the previous day's events, 49 presented a strong condemnation of the opposition, SPO, and Drašković. \"Večernje novosti\", edited by Rade Brajović, ran a fairly balanced March 10 issue, mostly covering the events neutrally and avoiding emotional outbursts in favour of either side. However, according to the paper's journalist Miroslav Turudić, at the staff meeting that very Sunday evening the editor-in-chief Brajović objected to the paper's coverage of the protests. Along with deciding to steer the coverage in the following day's issue clearly to the Milošević's side, Brajović also published a commentary in which he openly criticizes his staff's previous coverage of the protests.\n\nDS held a press conference with its president Dragoljub Mićunović as well as members Zoran Đinđić and Vojislav Koštunica on hand, voicing support to arrested Drašković and SPO while condemning government actions. Đinđić described the events of the previous day as \"the police carrying out a plan, a one man's personal plan, one man who decided that this protest can not and will not happen\" going on to say that \"the catastrophe occurred due to the inability of those giving orders to the police to adapt to the rapidly changing situation on the ground\".\n\nDuring late evening hours, a large crowd again began to gather, but this time in front of the Terazije fountain. The protest now assumed a more civil tone, although there were still incidents on Branko's Bridge when a group of 5,000 University of Belgrade students heading into the city centre from their residence in Studentski Grad in order to join the protesters got stopped by police. Pepper spray was used and some of the students were beaten, but all of them were eventually allowed to pass through and join the crowd at Terazije (among the individuals negotiating with the police on the bridge was a Democratic Party (DS) member Zoran Đinđić).\n\nGatherings in front of the Terazije fountain were notably led and moderated by actor Branislav Lečić with various figures from Serbian public life such as screenwriter Dušan Kovačević, actor Rade Šerbedžija, and even Serbian Patriarch Pavle taking turns addressing the crowd. In his speeches, Lečić often referred to the rally as \"Velvet Revolution\" while holding a stuffed panda toy and drawing parallels with the Czechoslovak protests of November 1989.\n\nThe protest also expanded in terms of the political figures that joined it with DS members now officially taking part. The anti-government component was now much more prominently displayed among the crowds. The protesters, composed largely of students, demanded freedom for Drašković and Jovan Marjanović. In addition to earlier protests for the resignation of Dušan Mitević, they now wanted the Minister of Interior Radmilo Bogdanović to resign too. They also sought the lifting of the broadcast ban for Radio B92 and RTV Studio B.\n\nOn March 11, the Serbian government regrouped by organising a mass counter-rally at their old stomping grounds Ušće. Called under the name \"For the defense of the Republic, for constitutionality, freedom, and democracy\", the rally attempted to show that protesters at the Republic Square and Terazije in no way represented the wishes and desires of the majority of Serbian population. Using previously developed and tested astroturfing methods, they bussed many workers into Belgrade from other parts of Serbia for the occasion and also used its grip on state TV to inflate the crowd size. Still, a good portion of the crowd was there on its own volition, especially older individuals and many pensioners that were always Milošević's core support. Instead of Milošević addressing the gathered crowd, the speaking was left to his party's most publicly prominent members and ideologues at the time: Mihailo Marković, Dušan Matković, Živorad Igić, Radoman Božović, Petar Škundrić, etc. The most controversial speech of the day was Matković's, at times referring to protesters as \"hooligans\" and inciting their own supporters to \"do away with them\".\n\nThe protests persisted and after four days of mostly peaceful demonstration (there were further skirmishes with police on March 11), they achieved their aims: Drašković and Marjanović were freed and Mitević and Bogdanović were replaced.\n\nThe demonstrations ended after March 14.\n\n\n\n"}

Voices, formerly Associated Content, was hacked in July 2012. The hack is supposed to have leaked approximately half a million email addresses and passwords associated with Yahoo! Contributor Network. The suspected hacker group, D33ds, used a method of SQL Injection to penetrate Yahoo! Voice servers. Security experts said that the passwords were not encrypted and the website did not use a HTTPS Protocol, which was one of the major reasons of the data breach. The email addresses and passwords are still available to download in a plaintext file on the hacker's website. The hacker group described the hack as a \"wake-up call\" for Yahoo! security experts. Joseph Bonneau, a security researcher and a former product analysis manager at Yahoo, said \"Yahoo can fairly be criticized in this case for not integrating the Associated Content accounts more quickly into the general Yahoo login system, for which I can tell you that password protection is much stronger.\"\n\nD33DS, the suspected hacker group, said that the hack was a \"wake-up call\". They said that it was not a threat to Yahoo!, Inc. The IT Security firm TrustedSec.net said that the passwords contained a number of email addresses from Gmail, AOL, Yahoo, and more such websites. \n\nImmediately after the hack, Yahoo!, in a written statement, apologized for the breach. Yahoo! did not disclose how many passwords were valid after the hack, because they said that every minute, 1-3 passwords are changed on their site. Yahoo! said that only 5% of its passwords were stolen during the hack. The hackers' website, codice_1, was not available later on Thursday, after the hack. Yahoo! said in a written statement that it takes security very seriously and is working together to fix the vulnerability in its site. Yahoo! said that it was in the process of changing the passwords of the hacked accounts and notifying other companies of the hack. \n\nA simple matter had sparked a controversy over Yahoo!. The controversy was sparked because of Yahoo!'s silence about the data breach. After the servers were hacked, Yahoo! did not mail the affected victims, although it was promised earlier. There was no site-wide notifications about the hack, nor did any victim get any type of personal messages detailing how to reset their account passwords from Yahoo.\n\n"}

His real name is unknown but he agreed to speak to Canada's CBC News on condition that it would not be revealed. Huzaifa has been counselled by Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent Mubin Shaikh. He returned to Canada in 2016; rumours that he lives in the Toronto area have circulated. In 2018, he said in a podcast on \"The New York Times\" website that he murdered two people while fighting for ISIS and has been criticized by conservatives, some of whom have called for him to be found and arrested.\n\nAbu Huzaifa al-Kanadi was raised in or near Toronto, Canada, and went to Pakistan as a teenager to study. He claimed he studied at a Pakistani madrassa in 2013. He told his parents he would go to Turkey for a semester abroad and booked a flight from Lahore to Istanbul using his Pakistani passport. Upon arrival, he was met by a former resident of Mississauga—a city in the Greater Toronto Area—and visited the Syria–Turkey border town of Jarabulus to cross into Syria at night. Prior to leaving Toronto in 2014, he cleaned out his bank account. He returned to Canada in 2016 and is currently attending a university in the Toronto area.\n\nIn 2014, Huzaifa left Canada to join the Islamic State group; he entered Manbij, a city located north-east of Aleppo that had a population of about 100,000 people. He stated that he trained for a few weeks and was assigned to al-Hisba, an Islamic police force enforcing Sharia law. He used several hundred dollars to purchase a rifle, a Glock pistol, an ISIS military uniform, and other tactical gear decorated with ISIS badges. He said he made friends with other foreign fighters from Australia and Finland. He met Mohammad Ali of Mississauga, also known as Abu Turaab al-Kanadi, who was the only Canadian he met. He also stated that he knew about André Poulin, a Muslim convert from Timmins, Ontario, who was known as Abu Muslim al-Kanadi.\n\nIn a podcast on \"The New York Times\" website, Huzaifa said he had murdered people while fighting for the Islamic State. He also said he took part in a community killing and stabbed a drug dealer multiple times. He escaped to Turkey, where he was arrested by authorities before being released a week later. After his release, he returned to Pakistan and stayed for two years before returning to Canada.\n\nHuzaifa returned to Canada in 2016 after two years of fighting for the Islamic State. Upon his return, he had discussions with journalist Rukmini Callimachi; she stated that he initially felt confident that he had escaped law enforcement. Former schoolmates stated that Huzaifa was a \"loner\" and an \"anti-social guy\" without \"many friends\". Huzaifa's background story was compared to those of Quebec Mosque shooter Alexandre Bissonnette and Toronto van attack suspect Alek Minassian. A year after Huzaifa returned, he was interviewed by CBC News and stated that he saw violence on a scale he could \"never imagine\" when he fought for the Islamic State. Mubin Shaikh stated that Huzaifi could be \"rehabilitated\" and that Canada needs to \"have an eye\" on him.\n\nAfter Huzaifa said he fought for the Islamic State, Conservative MPs called for action against him. Conservative politician Candice Bergen criticized Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Liberal government during Question Period for not ordering law enforcement to arrest him. Bergen also called for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale to reveal whether the government knew where Huzaifa was, but Goodale stated that doing so would be the \"opposite of keeping Canadians safe\". Trudeau called questions about Huzaifa \"divisive\" and received criticism from conservative journalist Brian Lilley. Huzaifa also received concerns from television journalist Diana Swain that he may be \"lying\" to \"The New York Times\" or CBC News.\n\n\n "}

{"id": "1199124", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1199124", "title": "Boilerplate (robot)", "text": "Boilerplate (robot)\n\nBoilerplate is a fictional robot which would have existed in the Victorian era and early 20th century. It was created in 2000 by Portland, Oregon USA artist Paul Guinan. Originally intended for comics, the character became known via a faux-historical website created by Guinan, and has since appeared in other media.\n\nBoilerplate was originally featured on a website created by Paul Guinan in 2000. The Boilerplate site details the history of a remarkable robot built in the late 19th century, and features photoshopped \"archival images\" in which Boilerplate (actually a 12-inch articulated model) is seen interacting with historical figures, such as Teddy Roosevelt and Pancho Villa. Becoming aware that some visitors to the site were taken in by its contents, making it an unintentional hoax, Guinan resolved to see how authentic he could make the character seem, working to ensure the descriptions of non-fictional events were accurate. He explained his motivation in a 2002 interview\n\n\"Certainly I felt happy about having achieved my goal,\" he said. \"I put this thing across as trying to be real, and people bought into it. So, that's a success! But, as an amateur historian, I feel a responsibility to get the story right. So I felt bad about some of these people being hoaxed. It was a mixed bag.\"\n\n\"But,\" he revealed, \"I thought, if I was getting this reaction and I wasn't really trying, then what would happen if I really tried?\"\n\nGuinan estimated that roughly a third of the site's visitors treated its faux history as real. Comedian Chris Elliott, while realising that Boilerplate was fictional, thought that the spoof dated back to the 19th century and included the character in one of his books (see below).\n\nGuinan later expanded his website into \"The History of Robots in the Victorian Era\", which features other \"turn-of-the-century robots, both real and imagined\".\n\nBoilerplate is built by Professor Archibald Campion in the 1880s and unveiled at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The robot's notable adventures include an expedition to the Antarctic, during which it saves the lives of the team members by singlehandedly moving ice floes, clearing a path for the ship to sail out.\n\nDesigned for the self-proclaimed purpose of \"preventing the deaths of men in the conflicts of nations,\" Boilerplate charges into combat during the Spanish–American War and the Boxer Rebellion. Campion and his robot also circle the planet with the U.S. Navy, make silent movies, and hobnob with the likes of Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla.\n\nBoilerplate is also active in the First World War, but disappears during the relief of Major Whittlesey's Lost Battalion, possibly having been captured by the Germans for study. Supporters of this theory point out that German military technology advances tremendously in the twenty years between the two world wars, encompassing guided rockets, experimental jets, and sophisticated tanks. Post World War II, Boilerplate is sighted on a number of occasions, often in Chicago.\n\n\n"}

Fashion Week allows for international and local designers to showcase their creations to the general public, buyers, celebrities, and fashion experts. The event was established in the city by Jay Calderin in 1995. It faced a few setbacks in the early years, but is now increasing its popularity and importance, as Boston becomes a more fashion forward city. Accessibility and diversity in programming allow the public to engage the week on many levels; experiencing a show, taking in an exhibit, participating in an educational program or joining in the festivities at a party. The week also contributes to a sense of civic pride about what the region has to offer and how it continues to evolve.\n\nThe Boston Fashion Week was founded by Jay Calderin in 1995.<br> Unlike other global fashion events such as the New York Fashion Week, Boston Fashion Week is a non-profit event with a low budget, that focuses on showcasing mainly local designers. However, the event was put on hiatus in 2004 because Jay Calderin felt that the show didn't match the quality of the clothes and was becoming very repetitive. \nBoston Fashion Week began again in September 2007. The event returned more powerful and with more attention of the media. It includes fashion shows and networking events. The week also contributes to a sense of civic pride about what the region has to offer and how it continues to evolve.\nIn the year of 2013 the Boston Fashion Week was held between September 27 and October 25 and it was specially dedicated to Alfred Fiandaca, who was a leading Bostonian fashion designer.\n\nJay Calderin is the founder of the Boston Fashion Week as well as the Executive Director. He was born and raised in New York City. He is a successful author of Fashion Design Essentials and Form, Fit & Fashion which the LA Times called, “a new fashion bible for designers, aspirers and the just plain curious, this tome contains all the secrets.” He has been involved with the charity of Big Brothers for over 10 years and states that it has been one of the most rewarding experiences.\nThe Boston Globe refers to Jay Calderin as \"a budding designer's best friend.\" Calderin founded Boston Fashion Week, and has served as the organization's Executive Director since 1995. In 2012 he was appointed Creative Director of the first Chengdu Fashion Week in China. His work as a fashion designer has graced the pages of Vogue and Elle magazines. He is an instructor and the Director of Creative Marketing at the School of Fashion Design in Boston. He also teaches at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Massachusetts College of Art and Design.\n\nEach year the Fashion Week returns for one week with all sorts of shows. This is an example of the 2009 Fashion Week\n\nThursday : <br>\n\"Bay State College Graduate Fashion Show\" took place in John Hancock Hall, Dorothy Quincy Suite\n\nFriday : \n<br>• \"MassArt Senior Collection Fashion Show\" took place in Boston Center for the Arts \n<br>• \"Lasell Undergraduate Fashion Show\" took place in Lasell College Campus\n\nSaturday : \n<br>• \"Lasell College Graduate Fashion Show\" took place in Lasell College Campus\n<br>• \"Mount Ida Graduate Fashion Show\" took place in Back Bay Events Center\n\nSaturday : <br>\n\"School of Fashion Design 75th Anniversary Fashion Show\" took place in The Boston Park Plaza Hotel Imperial Ballroom.\n\nSaturday : \n<br>\"RISD Collection 2009\" – Show Veteran’s Memorial Auditorium\nAvenue of the Arts (Francis & Park Streets.) In Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nWednesday : \n<br>\"MassArt Sophomore/Junior Fashion Show\" took place in MassArt Auditorium.\n\nAs the audience of Boston Fashion Week includes a wide range of different kind of people, such as celebrities, journalists, designers, and the general public, the pricing also shows huge variation. It varies according to the day and time of the event, the designer that is being showcased, the location, and the sitting arrangement. Tickets are available online, and there may be a difference of $100,00 USD in VIP front row tickets and general admission sitting. While some seats and runway shows are available through special invitation only, there also are days in which the event is freely open to the general public.\n\nThe Tent, an event within Boston Fashion Week, was first launched in September 2011 with the purpose of improving the profile of Boston Fashion Week, as well to present the creations of local designers. It allows them to successfully show their talent, giving them an opportunity to sprout their business. Since the creation of Boston Fashion Week in 1995, the Tent only happened twice, in 2011 and 2012, although it was very well received by the general public.\n\nThe first year of The Tent presented local well-known designers such as Emily Muller, Michael DePaulo, Daniel Faucher Couture amongst others. It took place from September 23 to 30, 2011. Access to The Tent was only under special invitation, which made this event front-page news. It consisted in a 3 000 square-foot tent containing 200 seats, established between the Prudential Center and the Mandarin Oriental Hotel. Around 20 designers were present and each one of them had 15 minutes to showcase their creations.\n\nThe second year of The Tent was presented with a twist. Unlike the previous year, a parade of well-known designers, including style guru Marilyn Riseman and the Fashion School of Design recruiter Jane Conway Caspe, skimmed through 80 possible designer's and chose the best 10 (nine of which were local, while the other one was from California. Those selected few, had their creations showcased at The Tent.\n\nAccording to Boston Fashion Week’s founder, Jay Calderin, he was looking for diversity of styles on the runway, instead of 10 gown designers and 10 wedding dress designers, like the last year's event. This allowed for an edgier, original, and more varied edition of the Tent.\n\nWhen it first started in 2011, the tent at Boston Fashion Week was front-page news. In 2013, The Boston Fashion Week surprised its spectators with the cancellation of The Tent. Scheduled from September 27 until October 5, the fashion week in 2013 was not anchored by an official tent.\n\nThe reason behind the cancellation of The Tent in 2013 was the lack of sponsorship in order to continue paying its expenses. According to Calderin, The Tent helped encourage up-coming designers to come forward, and show them a new level of production. It is uncertain if The Tent will return in 2014 \n"}

This low temperature was required to provide a sufficient cohesion within the Lemaître's primeval atom. In 1966, David Layzer proposed a variant on Lemaître's cosmology in which the initial state of the universe was near absolute zero. Layzer argued that, rather than in an initial high entropy state, the primordial universe was in a very low entropy state near absolute zero. \n\nThe mainstream version of the Cold Big Bang model predicted an absence of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation and was eventually explicitly ruled out by WMAP observations.\n\n"}
{"id": "1348524", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1348524", "title": "Costume party", "text": "Costume party\n\nA costume party (American English) or a fancy dress party (British English) is a type of party, common mainly in contemporary Western culture, where guests dress up in costumes. Costumed Halloween parties are popular in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.\n\nAustralian fancy dress parties typically follows the style of the United States, and Halloween costume parties have been common since the early 1990s, even though Halloween has not historically been a celebrated event in Australia. Typical events for Australians that involve dressing up are the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the staff Christmas party and cricket matches.\n\nOne of the oldest examples of fancy dress being worn in Australia is on display at the Western Australia Museum. It was a child's fancy dress costume worn by Rita Lloyd, aged nine, to the ‘Lord Mayor’s Juvenile Fancy Dress Ball’ at Mansion House in Perth on 8 January 1909.\n\nIt is a tradition to have a costume party at a university graduation.\n\nThe origins of fancy dress parties in the United Kingdom can in some respects be traced to masked balls of the 18th century period. In the period to 1850, fancy dress balls were a typical part of the social life of music festivals.\n\nCommon costumes of the period were specific historical characters, generic historical or regional clothing, abstract concepts (such as \"winter\", \"starlight\" or \"night\"), and objects (such as \"champagne bottle\" or \"aquarium\"). Popular characters included, for women, Marie Antoinette and Elizabeth I, and for men, Napoleon and Robin Hood.\n\nNotable amongst early events in the 20th century was the Chelsea Arts Club ball. Such events were often elaborate affairs and for the most part confined to those with considerable means.\n\nAmongst the general population, costume parties also occurred with increasing frequency from the late 1940s onward, although for the most part the costumes were simple affairs until the mid-1970s. Prior to 'cheap' costume imports from the Far East /East Asia (late 1990s), most costumes were either hired, or home constructed. Retail purchased costumes are, in respect of the U.K., a largely modern phenomenon (late 1990s onward) although 'accessory' items had been available for some time. Since the increased import rate in late 1990s onwards saw the many materials / products being imported from the Far East (with cost savings in labour and bulk orders). This has seen the price of purchased costumes becoming more and more affordable.\n\nCoupled with the modern trend in costume parties, 'retro' fashion as a costume theme (such as a 1970s or 1980s fancy dress) is also popular, the costumes to some extent parodying or pastiching the fashions of earlier decades. Amongst the most popular parodied costumes are: Audrey Hepburn (as Holly Golightly), Madonna in her classic stage outfits, and more recently Lady Gaga.\n\nFancy dress parties are popular year round in the United Kingdom. The 1996 novel \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" features the classic British costume party theme \"Tarts and Vicars\" at which the women wear sexually provocative (\"tart\") costumes, while the men dress as Anglican priests (\"vicars\"). Fancy dress parties have been held by the British Royal Family. Prince William, heir to the British Throne, celebrated his 21st birthday with an \"Out of Africa\" theme, Princess Beatrice of York chose an 1888 themed party for her 18th birthday, and Lord Frederick (\"Freddie\") Windsor and his sister Lady Gabriella Windsor, celebrated a joint birthday party with a pre-French Revolution courtly theme.\n\nIn late nineteenth century New York, costume parties were popular amongst the affluent. Costumes were typically historical European aristocracy. Authenticity was important, even extending to using actual period elements. For example, Cornelia Bradley-Martin attended her own party, the notorious Bradley-Martin Ball, dressed as Marie Antoinette, wearing jewellery actually owned and worn by Antoinette herself. The choice of aristocratic costume allowed rich Americans, with relatively limited family history, to assume some element of history and legitimacy.\n\nCostume parties are especially popular in the United States around Halloween, when teenagers and adults who may be considered too old for trick-or-treating attend a costume party instead. Costume parties are also popular during the carnival season, such as at Mardi Gras.\n\nAttendees occasionally dress in costume for popular science fiction and fantasy events, movie openings and book releases. Web site theonering.net held a \"The Lord of the Rings\" dress Oscar party that was attended by Peter Jackson. \"Star Wars\" parties were held to celebrate the opening of \"\". Many bookstores have held \"Harry Potter\" themed parties to celebrate the releases of the series' later novels, and some movie theaters have had Potter-themed celebrations as the movie adaptations have been released.\n\nLarger scale 'parties' are often related to organised societies or conventions.\n\nThe hobby of fan costuming and modern cosplay largely developed from the World Science Fiction Conventions (Worldcons), starting with the first in New York in 1939 when two attendees, Forrest J Ackerman and Myrtle R. Douglas, wore \"futuristicostumes\". From the 2nd World Science Fiction Convention (1940) in Chicago, masquerade balls were a traditional feature of the convention.\n\nFan conventions, often abbreviated to \"cons\", of various descriptions have followed the example of the Worldcons with many attendees wearing costumes representing fictional characters. Some conventions feature costume competitions and other scheduled costuming events. Several well-known conventions that feature costuming include the San Diego Comic-Con International, New York Comic-Con, and Atlanta's Dragon Con.\n\nCosplay (a blend of \"costume\" and \"play\" via the Japanese ) was coined by Nobuyuki Takahashi in reporting on the 42nd World Science Fiction Convention for Japanese magazine \"My Anime\". It is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplay is popular at conventions across the world.\n\nThere are many annual events that generate the chance to dress up in fancy dress costumes; Christmas, New Year, birthdays, Hen and Stag parties, and Book Day, amongst others.\n\nHalloween is the most popular costume or fancy dress event of the year in western society. Halloween originated centuries ago, the Celts believed that on 31 October the line between the living and the dead became distorted, condemned souls would come back to wreak havoc for the night. In defense, the Celts would dress up in ghoulish costumes to scare evil spirits away.\n\nWithin many fancy dress events, a theme is usually present, and with fancy dress outfits often from Hollywood films such as \"Star Wars\", \"Grease\", \"James Bond\", and \"Spider-Man\". Themes are also extremely popular with fundraising events, such as the \"Great Gorilla Run\", where 1,000 people dressed as gorillas in London in aid for \"Great Gorillas\", a charity that focuses on the endangered species.\n\nSome costume parties are themed around 80s fashion. The most popular costumes researched for such fancy dress are the Madonna Look, punk fashion and neon-colored clothing. Some of the easiest and cheapest 1980s costumes include \"Rambo\", Samantha Fox, and Tom Cruise from \"Risky Business\" or \"Top Gun\". Alternative eighties costumes include dresses, prom dresses and denim from the period, including high waisted pants and stone wash denim.\n\nFans sometimes attend sporting events in a costume as a sign of support of their favored team. Some sporting events have large numbers of fans attending in fancy dress costume, notably the Wellington Rugby Sevens where almost every fan who attends wears some sort of costume.\n\n"}

A new Supreme People's Assembly was elected in August 1948, and on 3 September a new constitution was promulgated. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed on 9 September, with Kim Il-sung as Premier. Because the date is 9 September, it is also called simply 9 · 9 (old version). \n\nThe holiday is celebrated throughout the country. On this day, events such as art performances, exhibitions, athletic events, and reports are held. On jubilee years (ex: 60th anniversary, 65th anniversary), military parades on Kim Il-sung Square take place with the participation of the leader of North Korea. It is also common for new children to be admitted to the Young Pioneer Corps on the day.\n\nIn contrast to many other holidays that are very politicized, the Foundation Day concerns the whole country. It also has an international and diplomatic outlook with foreigners being likelier to attend it than some other holidays.\n\nThe day was first celebrated in 1949. The intensity of celebrations has varied considerably. Celebrations in 1950 were low key due to the Korean War. In contrast, 1956 saw sizeable celebrations following Kim Il-sung's triumph in a domestic political crisis just days earlier called the August Faction Incident. In 1997 the \"Juche\" calendar was adopted on September 9, which became September 9, \"Juche\" 86.\n\nIn 2018, North Korea marked the 70th anniversary of its foundation. Russian Federation Council Chairman Valentina Matviyenko and Mauritanian President Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, as well as delegations from Cuba, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, the Dominican Republic, Uganda, and South Africa were in attendance during the celebrations. Chinese President Xi Jinping was expected to attend the parade during his state visit to North Korea on 9 September, however cancelled his attendance, instead sending Li Zhanshu to Pyongyang. The Korean People's Army has been preparing for the parade at Mirim Parade Training Ground since July 2018 and is expected to be one of the largest according to a satellite analysis of the capital.

Although Thomas Henry McMonigle was convicted for Chamberlain's murder, her body was never found.\n\nChamberlain was last seen outside Campbell High School in Campbell, California, after the end of her classes. According to her classmates, she spoke for several minutes with a motorist on Winchester Boulevard, who told her he was looking for someone to babysit his sister's children for the afternoon. The man wore a US Navy uniform and military medals. Chamberlain accepted the offer and got into the car with him.\n\nLaw enforcement's suspicions fell immediately upon Thomas Henry McMonigle, a San Mateo, California, resident with an arrest record going back to his teens and including antecedents for assault and attempted rape. McMonigle had left the area immediately and moved to his father's home in Illinois. On December 6, McMonigle attempted to commit suicide with an overdose of sleeping pills while riding a bus to San Francisco, but he was rushed to a hospital and made a full recovery. After his discharge, he was immediately arrested by FBI agents investigating Chamberlain's disappearance.\n\nMcMonigle, who had never served in the Navy, confessed to have found the uniform and medals in a footlocker that he had stolen from a real serviceman. This footlocker was found in McMonigle's home's garage in San Mateo. However, he offered wildly varying stories about Chamberlain's death and what had happened to her body. At various times, McMonigle claimed to have murdered Chamberlain by shooting, stabbing or strangling her; to have shot her accidentally; to have seen her die after a fall from his car; and to not be involved in her death at all. An examination of McMonigle's car found a bullet hole in the inside of a door, lending credence to the idea that Chamberlain had been shot in the vehicle. McMonigle claimed to have removed the bullet from the door and buried it under a certain tree in his backyard; and also to have ripped out the car's padding and upholstery because they had been stained with Chamberlain's blood, and subsequently buried them in a drainage ditch near his workplace. Both places were searched, and the bullet and car parts (still covered in blood) were recovered successfully. The bullet was tested and proven to have been fired from McMonigle's .32 caliber Colt revolver.\n\nMcMonigle also claimed to have thrown Chamberlain's body off a cliff overlooking Half Moon Bay on the San Mateo County coast, known as the Devil's Slide. Police searched the area and found two pairs of red and blue socks wedged on the cliff's face, which were recognized by Chamberlain's parents. McMonigle's claim that he had buried Chamberlain's clothes in his backyard could not be confirmed, but a separate excavation by the FBI at the construction site where McGonigle had been working at the time of the disappearance turned up a pair of shoes, schoolbooks, papers, a zippered binder and a cowbell property of Chamberlain.\n\nThe prosecution theorized that McMonigle abducted Chamberlain with the intention of raping her, murdered her when she tried to resist, and later carried her body to the Devil's Slide and tossed it into the ocean. He was pronounced guilty by the jury after only 38 minutes of deliberation, and sentenced to die in the gas chamber. While in death row, he confessed to the murder of a San Francisco woman and later to have murdered eleven people overall, but he was not charged with more murders. In his last statement before his execution in 1948, however, McMonigle claimed that he was not involved in Chamberlain's disappearance.\n\n"}

General societal attitudes towards disfigurement have varied greatly across cultures and over time, with cultures possessing strong social stigma against it often causing psychological distress to disfigured individuals. Alternatively, many societies have regarded some forms of disfigurement in a medical, scientific context where someone having ill will against the disfigured is viewed as anathema. In various religious and spiritual contexts, disfigurement has been vaoriously described as being as a punishment from the divine for sin (such as Yahweh's defacement of Cain for Abel's murder in Judaism), as being (such as Paul of the New Testament's arguments about Christ's sufferings) caused by supernatural forces of hate and evil against the good and just, which will be later atoned for, or as being without explanation \"per se\" with people just having to endure.\n\nThe topic has been frequently commented on and referred to in a great many forms of fictional media as well. Villainous examples include the iconic fiend The Joker from various DC Comics and the mysterious figure with a \"red right hand\" from the song of the same name by band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Heroic examples include Daredevil, a crime-fighter who was rendered blind (from Marvel Comics), and the compassionate character Edward Scissorhands from the film of the same name.\n\nDisfigurement, whether caused by a benign or malignant condition, often leads to severe psychosocial problems such as negative body image; depression; difficulties in one's social, sexual, and professional lives; prejudice; and intolerance. This is partly due to how the individual copes with looking 'visibly different', though the extent of the disfigurement rarely correlates with the degree of distress the sufferer feels. An additional factor which affects sufferers of a disfigurement is the reaction they get from other people. Studies have shown that the general population respond to people with a disfigurement with less trust, less respect and often try to avoid making contact or having to look at the disfigurement. Disfigurements affecting visible areas such as the face, arms and hands are thought to present greater difficulty for sufferers to cope with than do other disfigurements.\n\nDeliberate mutilation resulting in physical disfigurement has also been practiced by many cultures throughout human history for religious or judicial purposes. During the Byzantine Empire, the emperor was considered God's viceregent on Earth, and as such the physical wholeness of his person was an essential complement to the perfection of Heaven. For this reason, many deposed emperors were blinded, had their noses cut off, or their tongue split by their successors, as these permanent disfigurements disqualified them from ever reclaiming the throne.\n\nA case of voluntary disfigurement is that of St. Æbbe the Younger and the nuns of Coldingham Monastery in Scotland. When the monastery was attacked by Vikings and they feared being raped, she and the nuns cut off their own noses and upper lips. In revenge, the Vikings burned down the building with the nuns inside. This is said to be the origin of the phrase \"cutting off the nose to spite the face\".\n\nConditions that can cause disfigurement include: \n\n\nPlastic surgery or reconstructive surgery is available in many cases to disfigured people. Some health insurance companies and government health care systems cover plastic surgery for these problems when they do not generally cover plastic surgery for what is labeled as \"cosmetic purposes\".\n\nThe term \"disfigurement\" is sometimes used pejoratively to describe the results of intentional body modification. Scarification and other forms of such modification will sometimes be referred to as such by neutral parties or by advocates of the processes as well. Many types of body modification are subject to strong social debate as such.\n\nPeople with disfigurement are often treated badly.\n\n\n\n\nwww.karibuanawim.com – Australian organisation for people with facial disfigurements\n"}

A downed animal, one that is unable to stand, is not necessarily a downer.\n\nThe animal's inability to stand may be caused by illness or injury. In nearly all cases it is considered by most farmers to be both humane and cost-effective to kill the animal when it becomes a downer, rather than keeping it alive and unhealthy. Once killed, and depending on how the animal became a downer and how it was killed, the animal may then be incinerated, buried, rendered, or slaughtered. Because of mad cow disease, the slaughter of downer cattle is a topic of great concern.\n\nThere are many possible reasons for an animal staying down, including:\n\nA longstanding issue is whether these animals are treated humanely or inhumanely by shippers, stockyards, and packers while they are being moved or held for slaughter. Legislation periodically is introduced in Congress to outlaw the sale or transfer of such animals, but livestock producer groups (who generally agree that livestock markets should not accept severely disabled animals) have long contended that their voluntary efforts to end harmful practices have already proven successful. The 2002 farm bill (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10815) required the USDA to investigate and submit a report on nonambulatory livestock, and to issue and enforce regulations, if deemed necessary, to provide for their humane treatment.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions have different rules about what can be done with a downer cow. In some jurisdictions the cow may be slaughtered without question. In others, downer cattle may not be slaughtered even if the cause is a physical injury. In the United States, meat inspection is usually an interstate commerce issue, and is regulated by the Federal Meat Inspection Act. Now all livestock auction barns are not allowed to take sick or downer cows because of the rulings that originated with the BSE \"mad cow\" crisis.\n\nIn Canada, transportation of animals is federally regulated. The Health of Animals Regulations state that an animal has to be fit for the intended journey and that a non-ambulatory animal cannot be transported because transport would cause additional suffering.\n\nThe Canadian authority responsible for the welfare of animals that are transported is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nThe downer issue took on another dimension when bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was found in two North American cows in 2003. Many experts believe that nonambulatory cattle are at higher risk of harboring BSE. As a result, on December 30, 2003 the USDA announced an immediate ban on the slaughter of downer cattle for human food use. At issue is how to monitor the hundreds of thousands of U.S. downer cattle (annual estimate) if they are no longer presented for observation and testing at meat packing plants; also at issue is what to do with their remains, and whether they have any non-food value.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "10401983", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10401983", "title": "Essjay controversy", "text": "Essjay controversy\n\nThe Essjay controversy involved a prominent Wikipedia participant and salaried Wikia employee, known by the username Essjay, who later identified himself as Ryan Jordan. Jordan held trusted volunteer positions within Wikipedia known as \"administrator\", \"bureaucrat\", and \"arbitrator\".\n\nOn July 24, 2006, Wikipedia critic Daniel Brandt started a thread titled \"Who is Essjay?\" (later retitled \"Who is Essjay?, Probably he's Ryan Jordan\" after Jordan's self-disclosure) on the forum site Wikipedia Review. The ensuing discussion brought to light contradictions in claims Essjay made about his academic qualifications and professional experiences on his Wikipedia user page. Jordan claimed that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university. Five days later, \"The New Yorker\" published an interview with Essjay which repeated some of the claims. Wikipedia Review found definitive proof that Jordan made false claims about his qualifications and experience, including that he was a \"tenured professor\", a claim that was used to describe Essjay in the interview for \"The New Yorker\". In January 2007, Brandt contacted the author of the article in \"The New Yorker\" about the discrepancies in Jordan's biography and the exploitation of his supposed qualifications as leverage in internal disputes over Wikipedia content.\n\nThe controversy that ensued focused on his falsification of a persona and qualifications, the impact of this deception on perceptions of Wikipedia (and its policies and credibility), and the quality of decisions made in his promotion, support, and employment.\n\nReactions to the disclosure were diverse, encompassing commentary and articles in the electronic, print, and broadcast media; the Wikipedia community researched Essjay's article edits to check for errors and debated proposals to improve the project's handling of personal identification. In his editorial activities Jordan spent less time editing the content of articles and more time addressing vandalism and resolving editorial disputes.\n\nWikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales initially supported Essjay's use of a persona, saying, \"I regard it as a pseudonym and I don't really have a problem with it.\" Later, Wales withdrew his support and asked for Essjay's resignation from his positions with Wikipedia and Wikia. Wales stated that he withdrew his support when he learned that \"Essjay used his false credentials in content disputes\" on Wikipedia.\n\n\nStacy Schiff, a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist writing for \"The New Yorker\", interviewed Essjay as a source for an article about Wikipedia (\"Know It All\"; July 31, 2006) after he was recommended to her by a member of the Wikimedia Foundation. According to \"The New Yorker\", Essjay \"was willing to describe his work as a Wikipedia administrator but would not identify himself other than by confirming the biographical details that appeared on his user page.\"\n\nDuring the interview, Jordan told \"The New Yorker\" and had previously stated on his Wikipedia user page that he held doctoral degrees in theology and canon law and worked as a tenured professor at a private university. It was later discovered that he was 24 years old, and had dropped out of community college with no qualifications. \"The New Yorker\" published a correction in February 2007, which brought the issue to broader public attention.\n\nThe article said that Essjay spent some 14 hours or more a day on Wikipedia but was careful to keep his online life a secret from his colleagues and friends. It portrayed Essjay as often taking his laptop to class so he could be available to other Wikipedians while giving a quiz. He asserted that he required anonymity to avoid cyberstalking.\n\nJordan, as Essjay, claimed he sent an email to a college professor using his invented persona's credentials, vouching for Wikipedia's accuracy. In the message he wrote in part, \"I am an administrator of the online encyclopedia project Wikipedia. I am also a tenured professor of theology; feel free to have a look at my Wikipedia user page (linked below) to gain an idea of my background and credentials.\"\n\nWhen Essjay was hired by Wikia in January 2007, he changed his Wikia profile and \"came clean on who he really was\", identifying himself as Ryan Jordan. Other Wikipedia editors questioned Essjay on his Wikipedia talk page about the apparent discrepancy between his new Wikia profile and his previously claimed credentials. Essjay posted a detailed explanation in response to the first inquiry, stating that:\n\nHe later commented on his Wikipedia user page about having fooled Schiff by \"... doing a good job playing the part.\"\n\nWikipedia critic Daniel Brandt then wrote a letter reporting the identity discrepancy to Stacy Schiff and \"The New Yorker\". In late February 2007, the magazine updated its article with a correction indicating that \"Essjay now says that his real name is Ryan Jordan, that he is twenty-four and holds no advanced degrees, and that he has never taught.\"\n\nOn March 3, 2007, Andrew Lih, Assistant Professor and Director of Technology Journalism and of the Media Studies Centre at the University of Hong Kong, said on his blog that a portion of Essjay's comments on the incident entered \"the dangerous domain of defamation and libel\" against Stacy Schiff. Lih stated that on Essjay's Wikipedia talk page, Essjay had written, \"Further, she [Schiff] made several offers to compensate me for my time, and my response was that if she truly felt the need to do so, she should donate to the Foundation instead.\" Lih noted:\n\nLih wrote that he contacted Schiff for comment about whether she had offered to pay Essjay for his time and quoted her return email. In it, Schiff stated that Essjay's assertion was \"complete nonsense\".\n\nSpeaking personally about Jordan, Wales said, \"Mr. Ryan was a friend, and still is a friend. He is a young man, and he has offered me a heartfelt personal apology, which I have accepted. I hope the world will let him go in peace to build an honorable life and reputation.\"\n\nEssjay had responded at the time with a statement on his Wikipedia page, in part reading:\n\nReaction from within the Wikipedia community to the Essjay/Jordan identity discrepancy was sharp, voluminous, and mixed. While most editors denounced at least some of his actions, responses ranged from offering complete support to accusing Jordan of fraud.\n\nAs the controversy unfolded, the Wikipedia community began a review of Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. \"People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments\", said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator and founder of the Wikipedia community newspaper, the \"Signpost\". \"Those will get looked at again.\" For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as \"Catholicism for Dummies\", a book granted the \"nihil obstat\" and \"imprimatur\" by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: \"This is a text I often require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's \"[sic]\" credibility.\" In another case (a discussion of the liturgical use of the psalms), he cited personal experience from \"the Abbey of Gethsemani, where I was a monk.\"\n\nJimmy Wales proposed a credential verification system on Wikipedia following the Essjay controversy, but the proposal was rejected.\nWales was \"reported to be considering vetting all persons who adjudicate on factual disputes.\" \"I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, but it does expose a weakness that we will be working to address\", Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. \"We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle\", Wales commented. However, he also warned that \"It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate.\" However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, \"I think what matters is the quality of the content, which we can improve by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor.\" A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would need to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such proposals.\n\nAs a follow-up to his initial comments to \"The New Yorker\", Wales wrote this apology to the magazine, which appeared in its March 19, 2007 issue:\n\nWales expressed his regret that Essjay had \"made a series of very bad judgments.\" He also commented that he hoped Wikipedia would improve as a result of the controversy.\n\nAndrew Orlowski, a frequent Wikipedia critic and writer for \"The Register\"—a British technology news and opinion website—criticized Jimmy Wales for hiring Essjay at the venture-capital-funded Wikia and for appointing him to the Wikipedia Arbitration Committee after Essjay had apparently admitted his previously claimed academic and professional credentials were false. Orlowski added that Essjay's actions betrayed a dangerous community mindset within Wikipedia.\n\nOthers to comment negatively included ZDNet writer Mitch Ratcliffe, who asked \"why lying about one's background qualifies a person to work for a company like Wikia, which proposes to help communities to record accurate information\" and asked for additional details \"such as when he fired Jordan and the reasons for the firing, as well as when he endorsed Jordan in public statements.\"\n\nLarry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia who left the project in 2002, called Essjay's response \"a defiant non-apology\" and elsewhere characterized Essjay's actions as \"identity fraud\".\n\nOther comments:\n\nFollowing the media coverage of the Essjay controversy, a number of academics noted the damage to the credibility of Wikipedia. On March 2, 2007, a report in \"The Chronicle of Higher Education\" commented \"the incident is clearly damaging to Wikipedia's credibility—especially with professors who will now note that one of the site's most visible academics has turned out to be a fraud.\" Ross Brann, a professor of Judeo-Islamic studies at Cornell University in Ithaca, stated that Wikipedia lacks a process of scholarly review, saying, \"They could make up your life if they wanted to.\" Brann also said that Wikipedia \"has no place in the University\", and he believed the Essjay incident would do nothing to change the unfavorable opinion that academics generally hold about the online encyclopedia.\n\nNicola Pratt, a lecturer in international relations at the University of East Anglia in England, stated, \"The ethos of Wikipedia is that anyone can contribute, regardless of status... What's relevant is their knowledge as judged by other readers, not whether they are professors or not—and the fact the student [Essjay] was exposed shows it works.\" In 2009, a lengthy article was published by the National Council of Teachers of English discussing the challenges of determining textual origins in college compositions, using a detailed history of the Essjay incident to set the context.\n\n\n"}

The organisation is prominent for its promotion of Irish and international culture. The festival takes place on and around Falls Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nThe festival was established in 1988 as a direct response to the Troubles, and specifically after the events of March 1988. The Special Air Service killed three Provisional Irish Republican Army members in Gibraltar. At one of the funerals of the three, an Ulster loyalist paramilitary attacked the funeral with grenades and pistols, killing three mourners (see Milltown Cemetery attack). At the funeral of one of the mourners, two plainclothes British servicemen were killed when they drove into a funeral procession (see Corporals killings). The community of west Belfast came under intense media scrutiny and was described by the British Broadcasting Corporation as a \"terrorist community\".\n\nSeeing this portrayal of his community as negative, misleading and damaging, Gerry Adams gathered a small amount of friends and various local groups to organise a community festival. Its purpose was to celebrate the positive side of the community: its creativity, its energy, its passion for the arts and for sport. The \"Féile\" was, and is, aimed at providing events and entertainment at a price that the majority of the community could afford.\n\nIn August 1988 the first festival opened with a relatively humble parade of floats and bands and Gaelic Athletic Association clubs walking in their club regalia to an open-air party in Dunville Park. Street parties were organised throughout the west of the city. Door-to-door collections were made to fund day trips to the seaside for pensioners and outings for young people.\n\nFéile an Phobail has garnered resounding praise and has grown to one of the largest community festivals in Europe. The carnival parade routinely brings together over 20,000 participants for a colourful, musical procession with specially-designed floats representing a chosen theme, dancers and children in costume and face-masks.\n\nIt has grown from a one-week festival to a year-round programme with many events. It established the first ever children's arts festival in Northern Ireland, the \"Draíocht Children's Arts Festival\", with activities ranging from sports to multi-cultural and educational events through both Irish and English. In 2003, 6,000 children and young people participated in Draíocht events.\n\nThe festival also has its own radio station, Féile FM. The station initially broadcast across Belfast for two one-month periods in the spring and summer, during which young volunteers were professionally trained in media and management skills for free. In 2007, the radio was successful in securing a full-time licence, and now broadcasts seven days a week, throughout Belfast. Some trainees have gone on to find employment in the local media, including UTV, BBC Northern Ireland and Irish News Online in Belfast.\n\nIn May 2009, Féile an Phobail launched Belfast's first dedicated comedy festival, \"Laugh at the Bank\".\n\nFéile an Phobail runs numerous festivals throughout the year. Among the festivals are:\n\n\nFéile an Phobail has rostered national and international acts to perform with local musicians, catering for all tastes in dancing and music: from Irish traditional music to world music and pop. Notable acts include Altan, Brian Kennedy, Mary Black, the Afro-Cuban All Stars, the Harlem Gospel Choir, Westlife and Status Quo.\n\nLocal poets and writers have read their works on the same podium as renowned authors such as Patrick Mc Cabe, Roddy Doyle and Evelyn Conlon. The festival has hosted the works of Ireland's leading playwrights and theatre companies, and has been the launching pad for world premiers, such as Frank McGuinness's \"Someone Who'll Watch Over Me\" and Marie Jones' \"A Night in November\" by Dubbeljoint Productions.\n\nThe discussion and debates have included talks by world-class journalists and documentary makers including Robert Fisk (\"The Independent\"), Michael Moore (Oscar Winner) and have witnessed Gregory Campbell (Democratic Unionist Party) on the same panel as Alex Maskey (Sinn Féin) at the annual West Belfast Talks Back.\n\nFéile an Phobail has also been host to notable artists and painters from Ireland and abroad and hosts a festival-long exhibition in St. Mary's University College. Other community exhibitions take place around west Belfast, organised by community groups in association with the August Féile.\n\n"}

The conferences exemplified the Haqqani-Naqshbandis' ambitions to establish itself as a major player within the American Muslim scene. The conference was supported in part by members of royalty, Muslim political and religious leaders from across the world. \n\nThe Los Angeles conference was from August 2 through the 4th, 1996, some 7,000 attendees and over 125 speakers from around the globe attended a three-day marathon of lectures, parallel workshop sessions, prayer, praise of Muhammad and Islamic social interaction. Officially known as the International Islamic Unity Conference, it started off with a press session on Friday morning and ended with a parade through downtown Los Angeles on Sunday evening. Attendees praised the organizers for an excellent, though intense schedule of speeches by muftis, Islamic scholars, international political leaders, American political figures and an array of interfaith events. \n\nChaired by Shaykh Muhammad Hisham Kabbani, the conference was sponsored by As-Sunnah Foundation of America, the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order and by a number of other charitable and religious organizations.\nMany felt the conference organization was exemplary, the facilities at the Los Angeles' Westin Bonaventure Hotel excellent and the wide variety of cultural food and Islamic entertainment very apropos for such an international event. The many San Francisco Bay Area attendees were happy to find a number of prominent local Islamic activists featured, as well as those from national ISNA, IQRA, MPAC and other national Islamic organizations well represented. \n\nThe spirit of unity was especially apparent at the \"Peace in the Streets\" session, where about 20 former gang leaders, along with the popular rap star MC Hammer, took shahada with Shaykh Nazim al-Qubrusi, Grand-mufti of Cyprus and worldwide leader of the Naqshbandi Haqqani Sufi Order. \n\nAttendees were treated to sessions on politics, importance of schools of thought, purification of the heart, establishing Islamic economic power, educational curriculum initiative and many other subjects, discussed from the main podium as well as in intimate workshops where speakers and attendees were able to express their views. A major event occurred on Saturday night, with the launching of the International Day of the Orphan, which is expected, given the sponsorship of California's Assembly, and endorsement by a number of international organizations, to become a globally sponsored day for recalling the plight of orphans and children in difficulty.\n\nThe Second International Unity Conference was held in August of 1998 in Washington D.C. The second conference was sponsored by the newly-formed Islamic Supreme Council of America and again chaired by Shaykh Kabbani.

It is about a company of actors who stage a dramatization of the story of Joan of Arc, and the effect that the story has on them. As in the musical \"Man of La Mancha\", most of the actors in the drama play two or more roles. Ingrid Bergman was the star of the original production, playing both Joan and Mary Grey, the fictional star actress who portrays her. As the play begins, Mary Grey and the fictional director of the play-within-a-play, Jimmy Masters, are in conflict over how Joan is to be played. The conflict is resolved during the course of the play.\n\nBergman won a Tony Award for this performance — one of the first such awards ever given. Other notable actors who appeared in this production were Joseph Wiseman and Sam Wanamaker. \n\nIn 1948, an adaptation of \"Joan of Lorraine\" was filmed in Technicolor as \"Joan of Arc\". This film also starred Ingrid Bergman, but it did not use the play-within-a-play framework. Instead, it made the story a straightforward account of Joan's life, omitting the fictional acting company altogether. Anderson's dialogue for the story of Joan was not only retained, but, in collaboration with Andrew Solt, expanded with additional scenes involving historical characters who do not appear in the original play.

His ancestors were early Maryland settlers and some of them took part in the American Revolution. For a few years he attended public school in Baltimore and then became a clerk in his uncle’s tobacco factory in Richmond, Virginia. Not caring for this work, he became a bookseller.\n\nWorking as a bookseller in Richmond, Ford then wrote a farce dealing with contemporary life. The farce was entitled \"Richmond As It Is\", and was produced by a minstrel company called the Nightingale Serenaders. This farce was fairly successful, and George Kunkel, the owner and manager of the Serenaders, offered Ford a position with the organization. He accepted, and for several seasons traveled as business manager of this company throughout the United States and Canada.\n\nIn 1854, Ford assumed control of the Holliday Street Theater, Baltimore, which he managed for twenty-five years. Later, he built the Grand Opera House in that city in 1871.\n\nFord also was responsible for creating three theaters in Washington, D.C. He opened his first theatre on Tenth Street in 1861. After it was destroyed by fire the following year, he rebuilt the structure on the same site and called it Ford's Theatre.\n\nIn 1858, Mr. Ford was elected President of the City Council of Baltimore, and by a force of circumstance was acting mayor for two years. He also was in the position of City Director, for one term, of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\n\nHe was a Commissioner of the McDonough Fund on part of the city, and managed the old Washington theatre for a season.\n\nFord was the manager of this highly successful theatre at the time of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. He was a good friend of Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth, a famous actor. Ford drew further suspicion upon himself by being in Richmond, Virginia, at the time of the assassination on 14 April 1865. Until April 2, 1865, Richmond had been the capital of the Confederate States of America and a center of anti-Lincoln conspiracies.\n\nAn order was issued for Ford's arrest and on April 18, he was arrested at his Baltimore home. His brothers James and Harry Clay Ford were thrown into prison along with him. John Ford complained of the effect that his incarceration would have on his business and family, and he offered to help with the investigation, but Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton made no reply to his two letters. After 39 days, the brothers were finally fully exonerated and set free since there was no evidence of their complicity in the crime.\n\nThe theater was seized by the government, and Ford was paid $88,000 for it by Congress. The treatment accorded to him following the assassination made him remain bitter toward the US government for decades.\n\nDuring his career, Ford also managed theaters in Alexandria, Virginia; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Charleston, South Carolina; and Richmond. It was at Richmond's Marshall Theatre, then under Ford's management, that in November, 1856, Edwin Booth first met Mary Devlin (playing Juliet to his Romeo), whom he later married. Joseph Jefferson was then the stage manager and a member of the company of this theater, as was Dion Boucicault. Ford also managed a great number of travelling as well as resident companies, which included the greatest stars, and actors of his generation. He had a reputation for being honest and honorable in his numerous business dealings. For instance, during the \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" craze of the late 1870s, he was the only American manager who paid Gilbert and Sullivan a royalty on the opera. This action prompted the authors and their manager, Richard D'Oyly Carte, to allow Ford to produce their next opera in America and to entrust their American business affairs to him; and he leased the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City, for the production of \"The Pirates of Penzance\" in 1879-1880 and other Carte productions thereafter.\n\nFor a period of forty years, Ford was an active and prominent figure in Baltimore's civic life. He was connected with many banking and financial concerns, and his business advice was sought and relied on. He was president of the Union Railroad Company, member of the Board of Directors of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, vice president of the West Baltimore Improvement Association, and trustee of numerous philanthropic institutions. In 1858, while serving as President of the City Council, he was made acting mayor of the city of Baltimore, and he filled this position with marked ability. His winning and gracious personality won him a host of friends.\n\nIn early 1894, Ford's health declined, his death at his Baltimore home of a heart attack during a bout of influenza came suddenly. He left a widow, Edith Branch Andrew Ford, who was the mother of eleven children. Ten of these were still living when he died: Charles, then manager of Ford's Opera House; George, a treasurer; John Jr, an advertising agent; Harry; Mattie, an actor; James, and the unmarried daughters Lizzie, May, Lucy, and Sallie. Two days after his death, a funeral was held at his house and officiated by two clergymen from the Central Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, and he was buried in Loudon Park Cemetery.\n\n"}

Russian apologists claim that it was impossible to convoy Chechen deportees to the railway stations in the plains due to a snowstorm, which is why according to them over 700 villagers, including \"non-transportable\" elderly, women and children, were locked in a stable fortified with dry hay and burned alive; those who broke from burning stable were shot. One of the witnesses assigned to the military unit, interpreter Ziautdin Malsagov, recalls that NKVD commander Gvishiani called the two newborn children in the stable \"bandits\" before ordering to burn the 704 people alive. After the incident, Gveshiani was reportedly congratulated for his success and good work by Lavrenty Beria, who promised him a medal.\n\nThe \"aul\" of Khaibakh was rediscovered through archaeological finds in Ukraine. World War II archaeologists found the remains of North Caucasian scouts who died during an operation behind enemy (German) lines. Letters addressed to their relatives were found in their water-resistant pockets, addressed to \"aul\" Khaibach. Stepan Kashurko, one of the archaeologists, accompanied by a former Soviet general, decided to inform the families that the bodies of their relatives were found, but they learned that the settlement no longer existed. In continuing their search, they discovered that while the Chechen soldiers were dying at the front, their relatives were burned alive by the Soviet soldiers.\n\nIn a refusal to permit the release of the 2014 film \"Ordered to Forget\" about the massacre, the Russian Ministry of Culture stated that it had searched three Russian state archives, and that \"as a result of the investigation, no documents were discovered proving the fact of the mass burning of residents\" from Khaibakh. Finally, the Ministry stated: \"This allows us to conclude that claims of this 'event' are a historical falsification.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "21486505", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21486505", "title": "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies", "text": "Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\n\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (, , , ) was the largest of the states of Italy before the Italian unification. It was formed as a union of the Kingdom of Sicily and the Kingdom of Naples, which collectively had long been called the \"Two Sicilies\" (\"Utraque Sicilia\", literally \"both Sicilies\").\n\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies lasted from 1815 until 1860, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Sardinia to form the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. The capitals of the Two Sicilies were in Naples and in Palermo. The kingdom extended over the Mezzogiorno (the southern part of mainland Italy) and the island of Sicily. Jordan Lancaster notes that the integration of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies into the Kingdom of Italy changed the status of Naples forever: \"Abject poverty meant that, throughout Naples and Southern Italy, thousands decided to leave in search of a better future.\" Many went to the new world. The kingdom was heavily agricultural, like the other Italian states; the church owned 50–65% of the land by 1750.\n\nThe name \"Two Sicilies\" originated from the partition of the medieval Kingdom of Sicily. Until 1285, the island of Sicily and the Mezzogiorno were constituent parts of the Kingdom of Sicily. As a result of the War of the Sicilian Vespers (1282–1302), the King of Sicily lost the Island of Sicily (also called Trinacria) to the Crown of Aragon, but remained ruler over the peninsular part of the realm. Although his territory became known unofficially as the Kingdom of Naples, he and his successors never gave up the title \"King of Sicily\" and still officially referred to their realm as the \"Kingdom of Sicily\". At the same time, the Aragonese rulers of the Island of Sicily also called their realm the \"Kingdom of Sicily\". Thus, there were two kingdoms called \"Sicily\": hence, the Two Sicilies.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies resulted from the re-unification of the Kingdom of Sicily with the Kingdom of Naples (called the Kingdom of Peninsular Sicily), by King Alfonso V of Aragon in 1442. The two states had functioned as separate realms since the War of the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. At the death of King Alfonso in 1458, the kingdom again became divided between his brother John II of Aragon, who kept the island of Sicily, and his illegitimate son Ferdinand, who became King of Naples.\n\nIn 1501, King Ferdinand II of Aragon, son of John II, conquered Naples and reunified the two kingdoms under the authority of the newly united Spanish throne. The Kings of Spain then bore the title \"King of Both Sicilies\" or \"King of Sicily and of the Two Coasts of the Strait\" until the War of the Spanish Succession. At the end of that war, the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 granted Sicily to the Duke of Savoy until the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714 left Naples to the Emperor Charles VI. In 1720 the Emperor and Savoy exchanged Sicily for Sardinia, thus reuniting Naples and Sicily.\n\nIn 1734, Charles, Duke of Parma, son of Philip V of Spain, took the Sicilian crown from the Austrians and became Charles VII & V, giving Parma to his younger brother, Philip. In 1759, Charles became King Carlos III of Spain and resigned Sicily and Naples to his younger son, who became Ferdinand III of Sicily and Ferdinand IV of Naples, later crowned Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in 1816. Apart from an interruption under Napoleon, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies remained under the Bourbon line (\"Bourbon Duo-Sicilie\") continually until 1860.\n\nIn January 1799, Napoleon Bonaparte, in the name of the French Republic, captured Naples and proclaimed the Parthenopaean Republic, a French client state, as successor to the kingdom. King Ferdinand fled from Naples to Sicily until June of that year. In 1806, Napoleon, by then French Emperor, again dethroned King Ferdinand and appointed his brother, Joseph Bonaparte, as King of Naples. In the Edict of Bayonne of 1808 Napoleon moved Joseph to Spain and appointed their brother-in-law, Joachim Murat, as King of the Two Sicilies, though this only meant control of the mainland portion of the kingdom. Throughout this Napoleonic interruption, King Ferdinand remained in Sicily, with Palermo as his capital.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna restored King Ferdinand in 1815. He established a concordat with the Papal States, which previously had a claim to the land.\n\nSeveral rebellions took place on the island of Sicily against King Ferdinand II (reigned 1830-1859), but the end of the kingdom came only with the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860, led by Garibaldi - an icon of Italian unification - with the support of the House of Savoy and their Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. The expedition resulted in a striking series of defeats for the Sicilian armies facing the growing troops of Garibaldi. After the capture of Palermo and Sicily, Garibaldi disembarked in Calabria and moved towards Naples, while in the meantime the Piedmontese also invaded the Kingdom from the Marche. The last battles took place at Volturnus in 1860 and at the siege of Gaeta, where King Francis II (reigned 1859-1861) had sought shelter, hoping for French help, which never came. The last towns to resist Garibaldi's expedition, Messina and Civitella del Tronto, capitulated on 13 March 1861 and on 20 March 1861 respectively. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies dissolved and the new Kingdom of Italy, founded in the same year annexed its territory. The fall of the Sicilian aristocracy in the face of Garibaldi's invasion forms the subject of the novel \"The Leopard\" by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa and its film adaptation. \n\nA monarchy over the areas which would later become known as the Two Sicilies existed as one single kingdom, including a peninsular and an insular part, dating from the Middle Ages. The Norman king Roger II formed the Kingdom of Sicily by combining the County of Sicily with the southern part of the Italian Peninsula (then known as the Duchy of Apulia and Calabria) as well as with the Maltese Islands. The capital of this kingdom was Palermo — which is on the actual island of Sicily.\n\nThe state existed in that form from 1130 until 1285. In the period of the Capetian House of Anjou during the reign (1266-1285) of King Charles I, the kingdom was split by the War of the Sicilian Vespers of 1282-1302. Charles, who was of French origin, lost Sicily proper to the House of Barcelona, who were Aragonese and Catalan, after they were able to gain the support of the natives. Charles remained king over the peninsular part of the realm, thereafter informally known as the Kingdom of Naples. Officially Charles never gave up the title of \"The Kingdom of Sicily\", thus there existed two separate kingdoms calling themselves \"Sicily\".\n\nOnly with the Peace of Caltabellotta (1302), sponsored by Pope Boniface VIII, did the two kings of \"Sicily\" recognize each other's legitimacy; the island kingdom then became the \"Kingdom of Trinacria\" in official contexts, though the populace still called it Sicily. Eventually by 1442 the Angevin line of the Kings of Naples was coming to an end. Alfonso V of Aragon, king of insular Sicily, conquered Naples and became king of both (1442).\n\nAlfonso V described the geographical area in Latin as \"Utriusque Siciliæ\", meaning \"of both Sicilies\", and used the name as part of his title.\nAfter the death of Alfonso in 1458, both Sicilies remained under the direct rule of the Crown of Aragon, but Naples had a different Aragonese king from the island of Sicily from 1458 until 1501. For a brief period Naples was controlled by a different power other than Sicily, in the form of French king Louis XII of France, who took the mainland kingdom and held it (1501-1504) for around three years. After the French lost the Battle of Garigliano (1503), the last Aragonese king, Ferdinand II of Aragon, re-united the two areas once again under control of the same power and the same king.\n\nFrom 1516, when Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor became the first King of Spain, both Naples and Sicily came under direct Spanish rule. In 1530 Charles V granted the islands of Malta and Gozo, which had been part of the Kingdom of Sicily for four centuries, to the Knights Hospitaller (thereafter known as the Order of Malta).\nThe period of direct Spanish rule under the same line of kings lasted until 1713, when control of Spain and of both Sicilies passed to the French prince Philip, duke of Anjou, who founded the Spanish branch of the House of Bourbon.\nAfter an eight-year spell of Savoy rule in Sicily (1713-1720), the two Sicilian kingdoms once again came under the same king after the Treaty of The Hague (1720) appointed the Austrian king Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor as their ruler.\n\nThe kingdoms were conquered from the Austrians by a young Spanish prince during the War of the Polish Succession; he became Charles VII of Naples. The two kingdoms were then recognised as both independent and under Charles' rule as a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons by the Treaty of Vienna. After Charles' brother, Fernando VI of Spain died childless, Charles inherited the Spanish Crown in 1759, reigning as Charles III of Spain.\n\nHis son Ferdinand then became king of the two kingdoms so as to maintain them as separate realms as required by the treaties restoring the junior Spanish royalty to the southern Italian kingdoms. Ferdinand was highly popular with the poorest class. Ferdinand's reign was highly eventful. For a brief period the Parthenopaean Republic controlled Naples with the support of those who supported the French Revolution. However, a counter-revolutionary army of the poorest class retook Naples in order to restore royal power.\nEight years later, Napoleon conquered the peninsular portion of the kingdom during the War of the Third Coalition and placed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the throne as king.\n\nFerdinand fled to his other kingdom, on the island of Sicily itself. Here the alliance he had previously made with George III of the United Kingdom and Tory Prime Minister the Earl of Liverpool saved him. The British protected Ferdinand and the island of Sicily from Napoleonic conquest with the presence of a powerful Royal Navy fleet.\n\nBack on the mainland, Joachim Murat had become the second Bonapartist king. In the \"Edict of Bayonne\" he was named as \"King of the Two Sicilies\", though \"de facto\" he never actually held the island of Sicily where Ferdinand was, and is usually referred to as just the King of Naples.\nMurat actually switched sides for a while, abandoning the Grand Army after the disastrous Battle of Leipzig in an attempt to save his Neapolitan throne. However, as the Congress of Vienna progressed, tensions arose as there was strong pressure to restore Ferdinand to the Neapolitan kingdom as well as keeping his Sicilian one. Murat returned to Napoleon and together they declared war on the Austrian Empire, leading to the Neapolitan War in March 1815. Ferdinand and his allies Austria, Britain and Tuscany were victorious, restoring him to his Neapolitan throne. To avoid further French attempts, it was agreed at the Congress of Vienna that Ferdinand would reunite his kingdom.\n\nWhen talking about the period from 1816 until 1861, historians refer to the Kingdom of Naples and the Kingdom of Sicily together as one state - the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. For the period prior to 1816, instead, historians refer to them separately with their own name, as they were separate kingdoms.\n\nBetween 1816 and 1848, the island of Sicily experienced three popular revolts against Bourbon rule, including the revolution of independence of 1848, when the island was fully independent of Bourbon control for 16 months.\n\nIn 1860, Sicily was invaded by a corps of volunteers, led by Giuseppe Garibaldi from the Kingdom of Sardinia. They successfully conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and incorporated the territory into the new Kingdom of Italy.\n\nThe peninsula was divided into fifteen departments and Sicily was divided into seven departments. The island itself had a special administrative status, with its base at Palermo. In 1860, when the Two Sicilies were conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia, the departments became provinces of Italy, according to the Rattazzi law.\n\nIndustry was the highest form of income if compared with the other preunitarian states. One of the most important industrial complexes in the kingdom was the Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia, which employed 1800 workers. The engineering factory of Pietrarsa, was the largest industrial plant in the Italian peninsula producing tools, cannons, rails, locomotives. The complex also included a school for train drivers, and naval engineers and thanks to this school, the kingdom was able to replace the English personnel which was necessary until then. The first steamboat with screw propulsion known in the Mediterranean Sea is the \"Giglio delle Onde\", with mail delivery and passenger transport purposes after 1847.\n\nIn Calabria were located the Fonderia Ferdinandea was a large foundry where cast iron was produced. The Reali ferriere ed Officine di Mongiana was an iron foundry and weapons factory. Founded in 1770, it employed 1600 workers in 1860 and closed in 1880. In Sicily (near Catania and Agrigento), sulphur was mined for gunpowder. The Sicilian mines were able to satisfy most of the global demand for sulfur. Silk cloth production was focused in San Leucio (near Caserta). The region of Basilicata also had several mills in Potenza and San Chirico Raparo, where cotton, wool and silk were processed. Food processing was widespread, especially near Naples (Torre Annunziata and Gragnano). Almost 99% of the industries present in the Kingdom were destroyed and relocated to the north by the occupying forces of the house of Savoy after the unification.\n\nWith all of its major cities boasting successful ports, transport and trade in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was most efficiently conducted by sea. The Kingdom possessed the largest merchant fleet in the Mediterranean. Urban road conditions were to the best European standards, by 1839, the main streets of Naples were gas-lit. Efforts were made to tackle the tough mountainous terrain, Ferdinand II built the cliff-top road along the Sorrentine peninsula. Road conditions in the interior and hinterland areas of the kingdom made internal trade difficult. The first railways and iron-suspension bridges in Italy were developed in the south, as was the first overland electric telegraph cable.\n\nThe kingdom achieved several scientific and technological accomplishments, such as the first steamboat in the Mediterrean Sea (1818), built in the shipyard of Stanislao Filosa al ponte di Vigliena, near Naples, and the first railway in the Italian peninsula (1839), which connected Naples to Portici. However, until the Italian unification, the railway development was highly limited. In the year 1859, the kingdom had only 99 kilometers of rails, compared to the 800 kilometers of Piedmont. This was because the kingdom could count on a very large and efficient merchant navy, which was able to compensate for the need for railways. Also, southern landscape was mainly mountainous making the process of building railways quite difficult, as building railway tunnels was much harder at the time. However, the first railway tunnel in the world was built there. Among the other achievements, one worth mentioning is the first suspension bridge in Continental Europe (1832), the first gaslight in Italy (1839), the first volcano observatory in the world, l'Osservatorio Vesuviano (1841), the first and actual archaeological excavations in the world (in the ancient cities of Pompei and Ercolano), the first faculty of Economics in Europe and the first faculty of Astronomy in Italy. The first suspension bridge, built in iron, the \"Real Ferdinando\" on the river Garigliano and it was built in the Reali Ferriere factory and Weapons factory in Mongiana. The rails for the first Italian railways were built in Mongiana as well. All the rails of the old railways that went from the south to as far as Bologna were built in Mongiana. Naples was the most populated city in Italy, and the third most populated city in Europe. \n\nIn 1860–61 the kingdom was conquered by the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the title dropped. It is still claimed by the head of the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies.\n\nFrancis I, King of the Two Sicilies, of Jerusalem, etc., Duke of Parma, Piacenza, Castro, etc., Hereditary Grand Prince of Tuscany, etc.\n\nSome sovereigns continued to maintain diplomatic relations with the exiled court, including the Emperor of Austria, the Kings of Bavaria, Württemberg and Hanover, the Queen of Spain, the Emperor of Russia, and the Papacy. \n\n\nUpon Ferdinando Pio's death in 1960, there was a dispute about who inherited the headship of the house. Ferdinando's next brother Carlo had, in anticipation of his marriage to the eldest sister and heiress presumptive of King Alfonso XIII of Spain, signed the so-called \"Act of Cannes\" on 14 December 1900:\n...Here present is His Royal Highness Prince Don Carlo our dearest loved Son and he has declared that he shall be entering into marriage with Her Royal Highness the Infanta Doña Maria Mercedes, Princess of the Asturias, and assuming by that marriage the nationality and quality of Spanish Prince, intends to renounce, and by this present act solemnly renounces for Himself and for his Heirs and Successors to any right and rights to the eventual succession to the Crown of the Two Sicilies and to all the Properties of the Royal House found in Italy and elsewhere and this according to our laws, constitutions and customs of the Family and in execution of the Pragmatic Decree of King Charles III, Our August ancestor, of the 6th October 1759, to whose prescriptions he declares freely and explicitly to subscribe to and obey.\n\nThe laws of the deposed Sicilian dynasty and the Pragmatic Decree of Charles III, issued by him as King of Spain and the Two Sicilies on 6 October 1759, required a renunciation only if the Crown of Spain (or the heir apparent thereto) and the \"Italian sovereignties\" were united in the same person, and in no other circumstances. This could only have happened in 1900 if the Count of Caserta, his oldest son Ferdinand, and King Alfonso XIII had all died, thereby leaving Prince Carlo as heir to the Two Sicilies crown and his wife as Queen of Spain, and if the Two Sicilies crown had been restored. It is claimed that theories advanced to suggest that the 1900 renunciation were in some way unnecessary have been formulated long after the fact, , but by 1907 a son (the first of four, along with two daughters) had been born to Alfonso XIII and Queen Victoria Eugenia and Prince Carlos's older brother Ferdinand had also had a son, Roggero, Duke of Noto, so it soon became irrelevant.\n\nPrince Carlo's son, Infante Alfonso, became the senior male of the house on the death of his uncle, Ferdinando Pio, Duke of Calabria, in 1960 and was proclaimed Head of the Royal House of the Two Sicilies, with the recognition of the Heads of the royal houses of Spain, Parma and Portugal, and the senior line (Bourbon) pretender to the throne of France. Prince Carlo and his descendants continued to be included as Princes of the Two Sicilies in the Almanach de Gotha from 1901–44, and in the Libro d'Oro of the Italian Nobility from the first edition in 1907 until 1964, at which time the editor came out in support of the cadet line claimant. Infante Don Alfonso took the title of Duke of Calabria, considering that the title of Duke of Castro (a Farnese inheritance) had been lost with the sale of the last portions of the duchy to the Italian government in 1941 (a sale from which Prince Carlo received his portion of the proceeds, along with his brothers and sisters, although if the alleged renunciation of 1900 had been valid he would not have been entitled to do so). Carlo married as his second wife, in 1907, Princess Louise of Orléans, and by her had a son (Carlos, killed in the Spanish Civil War) and three daughters (of whom Princess Maria Mercedes married Juan, Count of Barcelona and was the mother of King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and Princess Esperanza married Prince Pedro Gastão of Orléans-Braganza). The descent in the senior line is as follows:\n\nThe latter's immediate heir is Jaime, Duke of Noto.\n\nThe rest of the Bourbon-Two Sicilies family rejected Alfonso's claims, however, and recognized Ranieri, the next surviving brother of Ferdinando Pius, as head of the house. Ranieri took the style of \"Duke of Castro\" as his title of pretence. The representatives of the junior branch are as follows:\n\n\nThey also claim the office of the Grand Master of the Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15359693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15359693", "title": "Murder of Shiori Ino", "text": "Murder of Shiori Ino\n\nIn January 1999, Shiori Ino met , a 26-year-old who operated a series of massage parlors with his brother Takeshi, a firefighter. Komatsu claimed to be a 23-year-old entrepreneur who dealt in cars, real estate and precious metals. After four or five dates, Komatsu began presenting Ino with expensive gifts such as Louis Vuitton handbags and Gucci suits in public places, and screamed abuse at her when she refused them. He also began calling her at home, despite the fact that she had only given him her cell phone number. When Ino attempted to break off contact, Komatsu threatened her until she agreed to keep seeing him. On March 24, Ino confided in a friend that she was afraid for her life. On March 30, she wrote a will, and attempted again to break off the relationship. She relented after Komatsu threatened her family, including insinuations about physically harming her younger brother, a primary school student.\n\nOn June 14, Ino met Komatsu at a cafe and unequivocally stated her intention not to see him again. The same day, Komatsu, Takeshi and their friend came to the Ino family home, and threatened both Ino and her mother, presenting them with a series of lies about Ino being liable for fictional embezzlements that Komatsu had committed. They threatened Ino's father when he returned from work, who, unmoved, ordered them out of the house after telling them to take the gifts Komatsu had forced on Ino. The three retreated, specifically stating that they did not want the gifts back. Unbeknownst to them, Ino had made an audio recording of the entire ordeal, which she presented to the Saitama police the next day. Despite the outrage of one younger officer, the officers who met Ino told her that she had no case. That day, the Ino family received a call from someone calling himself \"Tanaka\" demanding the return of the gifts, following a series of about twenty silent calls. This daily barrage of silent calls continued until October 26.\n\nOn June 16, Ino again went to the Saitama police with her parents. The police again refused to take action, and suggested that she was at fault for breaking up with a smitten suitor after accepting expensive gifts. They also went to a free legal clinic run by the Chamber of Commerce as per suggestion of the police. After a fifteen minute consultation, the lawyer dismissed their concerns, stating that, \"But she had a lot of things bought for her, right?\" The following day, Ino received a call from Komatsu demanding they get back together. She refused, and stated that she had been to the police. Komatsu reacted angrily before hanging up abruptly.\n\nOn June 21, Ino sent everything Komatsu had forced on her to his address by courier service. The following day, June 22, Takeshi approached 33-year-old Yoshifumi Kubota, a former manager of one of their massage parlors, with a ¥20 million murder-for-hire scheme at Komatsu's behest. Kubota agreed, and in turn recruited two acquaintances, Akira Kawakami and Yoshitaka Ito. Komatsu departed for Okinawa on July 5 to build an alibi.\n\nOver the next four months, Ino's family endured an escalating series of harassments and threats, including hundreds of posters and letters slandering Ino and her father distributed throughout the neighborhood, and to the father's workplace. The family repeatedly went to the police armed with the letters, photos of license plates and other evidence, without any action being taken. They pressed libel charges, only to be actively obstructed by senior precinct police officers who were worried that having unresolved open cases would hurt their standing. In the meantime, Kubota, Kawakami and Ito, armed with Ino's photo, watched her residence and the local train station to plan the killing.\n\nOn October 26, 1999, Ino left her home on a bicycle, heading for Okegawa Station to attend afternoon classes at her college. Ito, watching from a nearby car, alerted Kawakami, who drove to the station and dropped off Kubota. Kubota walked up to Ino as she got off her bicycle and stabbed her once in the side. As she turned, he stabbed her again in the heart. Ino was pronounced dead at Ageo Central General Hospital.\n\nImmediately following the murder, the Saitama police began a campaign of disinformation, falsely portrating the victim as a promiscuous flirt with a taste for expensive brand-name goods. The tabloids, then the mainstream press, quickly jumped on the bandwagon, manufacturing lurid stories about Ino working as an escort. The Komatsu brothers and their accomplices were not arrested until a journalist, Kiyoshi Shimizu, investigated the case for himself. His report, published in the magazine \"FOCUS\", laid bare Ino's long ordeal, and included a photograph of her stalker.\n\nOn December 19, 1999, Kubota was arrested. On December 20, 1999, Takeshi, Kawakami and Ito were also arrested. On January 16, 2000, eight other people were arrested for assisting with the harassment, and a warrant was issued for Komatsu, who evaded arrest and went to Sapporo, Hokkaido, where he was tracked by reporter Shimizu. On January 27, 2000, Komatsu's body was found in a lake in Teshikaga, Hokkaido. His death was found to be a suicide, with a note in his hotel luggage indicating that he had planned to kill himself soon after he had arranged Ino's murder.\n\nA legislative hearing was convened into the police handling of the Ino case, and the Saitama police were criticized in the media for dereliction of duty. The head of the police force formally apologized to the Ino family. Following an investigation, six officers were disciplined and three senior police officers were fired and indicted on a documents falsification charge over their refusal to process the charges brought by Ino during the harassment campaign. On September 7, 2000, Toshio Katagiri and Hirokazu Furuta were each sentenced to a year and a half in prison, while Tsuyoshi Honda was sentenced to one year, two months in prison. However, they were allowed to receive suspended sentences. On December 22, 2000, Ino's family sued the Saitama police. On February 16, 2003, district court ruled that the police would have to pay consolation money, but denied that police neglect had allowed Ino's murder. On appeal, on August 30, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the original sentence.\n\nA stalker regulation law took effect in November 2000 as a result of Ino's murder. In 2001, Shimizu received the Editors' Choice Magazine Journalism Award and the National Association of Commercial Broadcasters in Japan Reporting Award for his coverage of the Ino case. He would later receive the same awards again after getting an innocent man cleared of charges in the Ashikaga murder case (part of the North Kanto Serial Young Girl Kidnapping and Murder Case) and pointed out similarities with how the police and prosecutors handled the Ashikaga and Iizuka cases compared to the Ino case.\n\nKubota was sentenced to eighteen years in prison. Kawakami and Ito were each sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Takeshi was sentenced to life imprisonment, but he appealed. On September 5, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld his original sentence.\n\nIn Japan, the crime has been dramatized for television twice. One version, based on Shimizu's writing, was aired on October 28, 2002. Another version, in which Rina Uchiyama played the role of Ino, was aired on December 13, 2003.\n\n\n"}

The designation was instigated following the suspension of the Russian Olympic Committee after the Olympic doping controversy. This was the first time since the Unified Team of 1992 that Russian athletes had participated under the neutral Olympic flag.\n\nDuring the 2018 Winter Olympics, two athletes from this team tested positive for banned substances and were found guilty of doping by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Both were sanctioned by the IOC and their results were annulled as a consequence of the ruling.\n\nIn December 2014, German public broadcaster ARD aired a documentary which made wide-ranging allegations that Russia organized a state-run doping program which supplied their athletes with performance-enhancing drugs. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events.\n\nIn May 2016, \"The New York Times\" published allegations by the former director of Russia's anti-doping laboratory, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, that a conspiracy of corrupt anti-doping officials, Federal Security Service (FSB) intelligence agents, and compliant Russian athletes used banned substances to gain an unfair advantage during the Games. Rodchenkov stated that the FSB tampered with over 100 urine samples as part of a cover-up, and that a third of the Russian medals won at Sochi were the result of doping. On 18 July 2016, an independent investigation commissioned by WADA concluded that it was shown \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the RUSADA, the Ministry of Sport, the FSB and the Centre of Sports Preparation of the National Teams of Russia had \"operated for the protection of doped Russian athletes\" within a \"state-directed failsafe system\" using \"the disappearing positive [test] methodology\". According to the McLaren Report, the Disappearing Positive Methodology operated from \"at least late 2011 to August 2015\". It was used on 643 positive samples, a number that the authors consider \"only a minimum\" due to limited access to Russian records.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. Following the release of the McLaren report, the IOC announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" reported the names of 17 athletes, of whom 15 are among the 28 under investigation. As of late December 2017, 13 medals had been stripped and 43 Russian athletes had been disqualified for competition in 2018. The number of athletes under investigation rose to 36 (and eventually 46) in December.\n\nRussia has denied the existence of a doping program with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, blaming the United States for \"using the Olympics to meddle in the Russian presidential election\".\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended from the 2018 Winter Olympics with immediate effect. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present (the Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem would be used instead). On 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternative logo for the OAR athletes' uniforms (shown on right). IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes\". \n\nAs of January 2018, the IOC had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the 2014 Winter Olympics and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to CAS. The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes, meaning that their Sochi medals and results were reinstated, but decided that there was sufficient evidence against eleven of the athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC were careful to note that the CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three of the 42 Russian athletes that originally appealed are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games.\nAn original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the 2018 Games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements were met would the athletes be considered for invitation to the Games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool at this stage.\nThe final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169 and, after speed skater Olga Graf dropped out, the eventual total was 168.\n\nIn the past, the Russian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had stated that it would be an embarrassment for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. However, his spokesman later revealed that no boycott had actually been discussed prior to the IOC's decision. After the announcement, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, announced that none of the Chechen athletes would be permitted to participate under a neutral flag.\n\nOn 6 December, Putin stated that his government were prepared to allow Russian athletes to compete at the Games as individuals, but there were still calls from other Russian politicians for a boycott. Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed to send fans to the Games with a Soviet Victory Banner. Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, suggested that the United States \"fears honest competition\"; while Vladimir Putin was of the opinion that the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". He called the IOC decision an unfair \"collective punishment\", saying \"It all looks like an absolutely orchestrated and politically motivated decision. For me, there are no doubts about this.\"\n\nThe popular Russian newspaper \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" reported that 86% of Russians opposed participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag. Despite the OAR designation, many Russian fans still attended the Games, wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Россия!\" (\"Russia!\") in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban. After the games, Russian figure skater Evgenia Medvedeva revealed in an Instagram post that the Russian tricolor was hidden on the OAR medal ceremony uniforms underneath a white fur scarf buttoned on the front of the jacket.\n\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation voiced support for allowing the full participation of \"all clean Russian athletes\" in the 2018 Winter Games, calling on the IOC to refrain from imposing \"collective punishment\".\n\nThe IOC's decision was heavily criticized by Jack Robertson, who was primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of WADA. Robertson argued that the IOC had issued \"a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC's] and Russia's commercial and political interests\". He also highlighted the fact that Russian whistleblowers proved beyond doubt that \"99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping\". According to Robertson, \"[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you're done\". He added \"There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased.\" It was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to secure Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov's extradition to Russia (Rodchenkov being the main whistleblower).\n\nThe CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was fiercely criticised by Olympic officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach who said the decision was \"extremely disappointing and surprising\". Whistleblower Rodchenkov's lawyer stated that \"the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment\", also that \"[the CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically\".\n\nCurler Alexander Krushelnitskiy failed his doping test after winning bronze in the mixed doubles curling as he tested positive for meldonium. This is a drug used for treating heart conditions such as angina, chronic heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other cardiovascular disorders. It has the effect of increasing blood flow and can lead to an improvement in endurance. Meldonium was placed on WADA's list of substances banned from use by athletes two years previously. Krushelnitskiy's wife and mixed doubles curling partner Anastasia Bryzgalova tested negative for meldonium, but they were both forced by the IOC to return their bronze medals since CAS had found Krushelnitskiy guilty of doping. He would later announce his decision not to contest the IOC's ruling, but reserved the right to challenge the suspension should the investigation conclude \"no fault or negligence\". Norway was subsequently awarded the bronze medal for the mixed doubles curling event.\n\nNadezhda Sergeeva, a bobsleigh pilot, tested positive for trimetazidine, a drug used for treating angina and which is also included in WADA’s list of banned substances. She placed 12th in the women's competition, but had passed her drug test five days before the first runs were held at the start of the event.\n\nThe following is the list of number of competitors that could participate at the Games per sport/discipline.\n\nRussia has qualified three male and two female skiers.\n\nBased on their Nations Cup rankings in the 2016–17 Biathlon World Cup, Russia has qualified 6 men and 5 women. However, the IOC only invited 2 men and 2 women.\n\nBased on their rankings in the 2017–18 Bobsleigh World Cup, Russia has qualified 6 sleds.\n\n\nRussia qualified 12 athletes, seven male and five female.\n\nRussia has qualified their women's team (five athletes), by finishing in the top seven teams in Olympic Qualification points.

In its post-Olympics World Ranking, the IIHF counted this as a result for the Russian team. The IIHF considers this victory to be Russia's second gold medal in the Olympics, as they also attributed the 1992 Unified Team gold medal to Russia. However, the IOC does not attribute either of these results to Russia.\n\n\nRussia women's national ice hockey team qualified by finishing 4th in the 2016 IIHF World Ranking.\n\n\n\n\nBased on the results from the World Cups during the 2017–18 Luge World Cup season, Russia qualified 8 sleds (10 athletes).

It was the first public opera house to be established in Germany: not a court opera, as in many other towns. Everybody could buy a ticket, like in Venice. Most works were in the German language or translated librettos (from Italian). \n\nThe building was torn down in 1756, but rebuilt in 1765.\n\nHamburg was a rich city and hardly affected by the Thirty Years' War. \n\nThe founding of the Hamburg opera was an initiative of the well-traveled lawyer and alderman Gerhard Schott, who was impressed by Italian opera and Johann Adam Reincken, a local church organist. Johann Theile, Kapellmeister of Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who lived during the years 1675-1679 and 1684-1689 in exile in the city, organised its first performance. \nFor the construction of the stage the Italian engineer and architect Girolamo Sartorio was attracted by the private company. Protests and accusations by some Hamburg ministers before and after the opening held on for several years, and is known as the first \"Hamburger Theaterstreit\".\n\nThe opening of the house took place on 2 January 1678 with Johann Theile's sacred opera \"Adam und Eva\", succeeded by works of Nicolò Minato and Antonio Sartorio, Johann Wolfgang Franck with \"Cara Mustapha\" (1686), Agostino Steffani, Carlo Pallavicino and Johann Sigismund Kusser. Because of an argument with the management, Kusser organized an opera in the refectory of the local Dom. \n\nIn 1695 Reinhard Keiser took over the post of Kapellmeister until 1718; from 1703 to 1707 he also held the directorship. In 1703 Handel came from Halle to Hamburg as a cembalist and violin player, and a famous duel took place between Handel and Mattheson, during and after which \"Cleopatra\" was performed. One of the musicians was Christoph Graupner. In 1705 (?) Handel met with Gian Gastone de' Medici, who invited him to Pratolino.\n\nAgostino Steffani, Johann Mattheson, Georg Friedrich Händel, Nicolaus Adam Strungk, Johann Philipp Förtsch, Georg Bronner, Johann Philipp Krieger, Georg Caspar Schürmann, and Johann Georg Conradi composed Singspiele or baroque opera's for the Hamburg opera. There were performances on two or three days a week, and around 90 performances a year. The opera season started in Winter; in Summer and on religious holidays the theatre was closed. Because of the long scene changes each performance took four to six hours and began by afternoon.\n\nIn 1722 Georg Philipp Telemann took over the management of the opera house, which he held until the end of 1738. In 1727 the first German opera \"Dafne\" (lost) by Heinrich Schütz was performed. From 1743 till 1750 the building was used by Angelo Mingotti, performing Italian opera's by Johann Adolph Hasse and Pergolesi. Christoph Willibald Gluck performed his works in 1748. In 1750 the building was sold.\n\nBetween 1767 and 1770 Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was the dramatist in what was called Deutsches Nationaltheater.\n\n"}
{"id": "635058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=635058", "title": "Opera Comique", "text": "Opera Comique\n\nThe Opera Comique was a 19th-century theatre constructed in Westminster, London, between Wych Street and Holywell Street with entrances on the East Strand. It opened in 1870 and was demolished in 1902, to make way for the construction of the Aldwych and Kingsway. It is perhaps best remembered for hosting several of the early Gilbert and Sullivan operas' original runs.\n\nThe Opera Comique opened in 1870, followed shortly by construction of the adjoining Globe Theatre in Newcastle Street. It had a seating capacity of 862. The two theatres, both owned by Sefton Parry, were built back to back and called the \"Rickety Twins\", on the site of the former Lyon's Inn, an old Inn of Chancery, previously belonging to the Inner Temple. The theatre, built partly underground, had three entrances through long narrow tunnels from three streets (including the Strand) and was therefore nicknamed the \"Theatre Royal, Tunnels\". It was reportedly hastily built and draughty, and its long flight of stairs leading down to the level of the stalls was a dangerous fire hazard. However, it was nicely decorated. Parry built the theatre cheaply, hoping \"to make handsome profits in compensation when the area was demolished, which was even then in contemplation\".\n\nThe theatre was opened with a French company led by the veteran actress Pauline Virginie Déjazet. This was followed by the Parisian company, Comédie-Française, who made the theatre their base during the Franco-Prussian War.\nThe first home-grown production at the theatre was a musical play in 1871, \"Marie\", with music by Richard D'Oyly Carte and a libretto by E. Spencer Mott. This accompanied an English adaptation of a Molière work, called \"The Doctor in Spite of Himself\", which was a failure. The theatre then turned to presenting French works in translation; however, the public did not approve of its French name and repertoire, and the theatre was not popular. In 1873, Italian tragedienne Adelaide Ristori appeared there. In 1874, Carte's light opera company presented \"The Broken Branch\", an English version of Gaston Serpette's \"La branch cassée\", starring Pauline Rita. The following year, Rita starred in the title role, Clairette Angot, in a revival of Lecocq's \"La fille de Madame Angot\" at the theatre.\n\nIn November 1877, the Comedy Opera Company, managed by Carte, took on the lease and returned to produce the première of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Sorcerer\", a proudly English comic opera, at the theatre. This was followed in 1878 by the same team's patriotic \"H.M.S. Pinafore\", which became a hit, running for 571 performances, the second-longest theatrical run in history, to that date. During the performance on 31 July 1879, Carte's former business partners in the Comedy Opera Company (with whom Carte, Gilbert and Sullivan had split) tried to seize the set, creating a celebrated fracas. Over Christmas 1878, during the run of \"Pinafore\", the theatre was renovated and redecorated by E. W. Bradwell, reopening on 1 February 1879. The theatrical newspaper, \"The Era\" commented, \"We can hardly overpraise the beauty and grace of the Opera Comique as it now appears to the delighted audience.\"\n\nTwo more Gilbert and Sullivan successes followed, now produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company: \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1880) and, finally, \"Patience\" (1881), which was later transferred to Carte's new and larger theatre, the Savoy. During this period, Carte also presented various companion pieces with the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, including the 1877 revival of \"Dora's Dream\" by Arthur Cecil and Alfred Cellier; \"The Spectre Knight\" (1878); revivals of \"Trial by Jury\"; several pieces by George Grossmith beginning in 1878: \"Beauties on the Beach\", \"A Silver Wedding\", \"Five Hamlets\", and \"Cups and Saucers\"; revivals of Gilbert's \"After All!\"; a \"Children's Pinafore\" with an entirely juvenile cast (1878); \"In the Sulks\" (1880); and \"Uncle Samuel\" (1881).\n\nOnce D'Oyly Carte left the Opera Comique, the theatre's fortunes declined. It was unoccupied from October to the end of 1881. At the start of 1882, John Hollingshead and Richard Barker presented \"Mother-in-Law\", a frivolous comedy by George R. Sims, which ran in a double bill with a burlesque called \"Vulcan\" until May. They were followed by a spoof called \"The Wreck of the Pinafore\" by H. Lingard and Luscombe Searelle, described by \"The Era\" as \"chiefly remarkable for its impudence\", which ran until October. During the rest of the 1880s a succession of managements presented a wide range of genres, from adaptations of French plays, Shakespeare, Sheridan, Ibsen, a Dickens adaptation by the novelist's son, to musical shows, including \"The Fay o' Fire\" by Edward Jones and Henry Herman, which \"The Era\" later described as \"notable as introducing Miss Marie Tempest to the regular stage.\" Composers whose works were presented at the Opera Comique in this period included Julia Woolf, Meyer Lutz and Victor Roger. Performers included Nelly Bromley, Frank Wyatt, Johnston Forbes-Robertson, Julia Gwynne and W. S. Penley.\nThe theatre was again renovated in 1885, under the proprietorship of the actor-manager, David James. \"The Era\" thought that the refurbishments made it \"one of the most convenient, handsome, and acceptable places of entertainment in London.\" James had bought adjoining premises in Holywell Street to make room for an extension to the theatre. The bars and circulation areas were, according to \"The Era\", much improved, a spacious smoking room was added, and new emergency exits were installed. In 1891, George Edwardes took on the management of the theatre and presented a burlesque of \"Joan of Arc\" by Adrian Ross, J. L. Shine and Frank Osmond Carr, with a cast including Arthur Roberts and Marion Hood. It was well received and ran from January to September. After that, the theatre reverted to its pattern of rapidly changing productions and short-lived managements.\n\nA feature of the early 1890s was the frequent presentation of adaptations from, or original works by, novelists such as Henry James, Rudyard Kipling and George Moore. A further season of French plays, performed in their original language, was followed by a German season, also given in the original tongue in 1894, which ran for more than two months. In 1895, \"Nellie Farren started her unfortunate season here with a bad comedy … and a worse burlesque\". Charles Villiers Stanford's comic opera \"Shamus O'Brien\" ran for two months from March to May the same year. Osmond Carr's \"The Maid of Athens\", ran for a month in June 1897, after which, said \"The Era\", \"nothing worthy of any record whatever has been attempted at this temple of the drama, which has had a singularly eccentric and mostly disastrous career.\" A revival of a musical adaptation of \"Alice in Wonderland\" with music by Walter Slaughter, produced by Horace Sedger, opened for the Christmas season of 1898 and ran until mid-February 1899. In March 1899, Sedger announced a burlesque for the Opera Comique, \"Great Caesar\", by Paul and Walter Rubens and George Grossmith Jr., but he changed his plans and presented it at the Comedy Theatre.\n\nThe Opera Comique closed in 1899 and was compulsorily purchased by the London County Council for £40,000. It was demolished in 1902 when the maze of slums in the area was redeveloped to create Aldwych (named after old Wych Street) and Kingsway.\n\n"}

In 2005 the match included Bam Bam, Bracito de Oro, Eléctrico, Fantasy, Fire, Mr. Águilita, Pequeño Damián 666, Pequeño Halloween, Sombrita and Pequeño Olímpico (then reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion). Pequeño Damián 666 would win the match, eliminating Bam Bam as the last opponent to take the victory. Four months after his 2007 \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" victory Pequeño Damián 666 would defeat Pequeño Olímpico to win the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship, although the title match was not a direct prize of the tournament Pequeño Damián 666's victory did elevate him up the contenders ranks.\n\n\nCMLL held their second ever Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament on January 6, 2008 and like the previous year it was a \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination match where the last survivor of the match would be crowned that year's \"Pequeño Rey del Aire\". Among the participants was the then reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pequeño Damián 666, who was actually the first man eliminated from the match. Other tournament participants included Bam Bam, Fantasy, Fire, Mascarita Dorada, Mr. Águilita, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halloween, Shockercito and Tzuki. The winner of the match was Mascarita Dorada, who had only worked for CMLL for a few months at the time and was in the middle of being built up as the focal point of the Mini-Estrellas division.\n\n\nThe third annual Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament took place on Tuesday January 6, 2009 in Arena Coliseo, the first \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" tournament to take place outside of Arena México. The \"torneo cibernetic\" featured nine wrestlers in total, Bam Bam, Mr. Águilita, Niño de Acero, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Damián 666, Pequeño Halloween, Pequeño Violencia, Pequeño Ninja and Último Dragóncito. The final of the tournament saw Pequeño Black Warrior pin Último Dragóncito to win the 2009 tournament.\n\n\nThe fourth annual Pequeños Reyes del Aire took place on March 7, 2010 in Mexico City, Mexico, during CMLL's \"Domingos de Coliseo\" weekly event in Arena Coliseo. For the first time in the tournament's history Pequeño Halloween did not participate as he had left CMLL not long before the match. Also absent was the 2008 winner Mascarita Dorada as well as the holder of the secondary Mini-Estrellas title, the Mexican National Lightweight Championship Pierrothito, with no explanation of their exclusion. The match did include the holder of the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship Bam Bam and was the first \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" tournament for Pequeño Nitro and Pequeño Universo 2000 and had the repeated appearance of Eléctrico, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Damián 666, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia, Shockercito and Último Dragóncito which made for the most participants in the tournament yet. The tournament was won by relative newcomer Pequeño Nitro who earned a shot at the CMLL World Mini-Estrellas Championship the following week. Pequeño Nitro was unsuccessful in his title challenge.\n\n\nCMLL held their annual Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament on February 6, 2011 although they promoted the fact that the winner would get a shot at the CMLL World Mini-Estrella Championship than the tournament aspects of it. The 10 man \"torneo cibernetico\" saw the \"tecnicos\" (\"good guys\") team of Astral, Eléctrico, Fantasy, Mascarita Dorada and Mini Maximo faced off against the \"rudos\" (\"bad guys\") team of Mercurio, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Olimpico, Pequeño Violencia and Pierrothito. In the end Pequeño Olimpico pinned Mascarita Dorada to become the official challenger for Bam Bam's championship. The following week Pequeño Olimpico defeated Bam Bam to win the title.\n\n\nThe Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament returned in 2012 with the fifth version of the tournament, this time with 16 competitors, the largest number of wrestlers ever. The tournament took place on May 1, 2012 and was back in Arena Mexico. For the \"torneo cibernetico\" the competitors were split into two teams as Astral, Bam Bam, Mercurio, Niño de Acero, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Violencia, Pequeño Black Warrior and Último Dragóncito teamed up and faced the team of Aéreo, , Eléctrico, Fantasy, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Universo 2000 and Pierrothito. The final three wrestlers was Mexican National Lightweight Champion Pierrothito, CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pierrothito working together against Último Dragóncito. Dragóncito overcame the odds to eliminate both and take the 2012 \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" tournament.\n\n\nCMLL held a second Pequeños Reyes del Aire in 2012, this time in Arena Coliseo in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico on October 30, 2012. The tournament format was the traditional \"torneo cibernetico\" where the \"tecnico\" team of Aereo, Astral, Fantasy, Pequeño Halcón, Shockercito and Último Dragóncito faced off against the \"rudo\" team of , Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Violencia and Pierrothito. During the match Shockercito hurt himself on a dive. Pequeño Black Warrior won the match to become the first man to ever win two \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" tournaments. The 12 Mini-Estrellas involved in the tournament would face off again a week later inside a steel cage match, contested under \"Luchas de Apuestas\" (\"Bet match\") where everyone will risk either their mask or their hair.\n\n\nCMLL held the 2013 version of the Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament on January 6, 2013, once again in Arena Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico. The tournament featured 12 wrestlers in total: Acero, Aéreo, Bam Bam, Fantasy, Mercurio, Pequeño Black Warrior, Pequeño Halcón, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Olímpico, Pequeño Universo 2000, Pequeño Violencia, Shockercito. Pequeño Nitro was taken to the hospital to be examined for a potential shoulder injury. In the end Aéreo eliminated the then reigning CMLL World Mini-Estrella Champion Pequeño Olímpico to win the tournament, his first major CMLL accomplishment.\n\n\nCMLL held the 2014 version of the Pequeños Reyes del Aire tournament on January 5, 2014, in Arena Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico. The ninth annual tournament featured a total of 10 \"Mini-Estrellas\": Astral, , Eléctrico, Mercurio, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Olímpico, Pierrothito, Shockercito, Stukita and Último Dragóncito. The match came down to Astral and Eléctrico, both on the same team during the early portions of the match. In end Eléctrico landed badly on a dive to the outside onto Astral and hurt both himself and Astral. When Astral was unable to compete he was counted out and Eléctrico was declared the winner. The impact from the dive was so severe that both Astral and Eléctrico ended up having to go to the hospital after the match.\n\n\nThe 2015 Pequeños Reyes del Aire (Spanish for \"Little Kings of the Air\") tournament was the tenth version of an annual professional wrestling tournament held by Mexican \"lucha libre\" promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) that started in 2007. The tournament is exclusively for competitors in CMLL's \"Mini-Estrellas\" division and is their version of the regular division's \"Reyes del Aire\" tournament and has the same multi-man \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination format. The 2015 version of the tournament saw five \"tecnicos\" (wrestling term for the \"good guys\") face off against five \"rudos\" (the \"bad guys\") wrestling until only one man remains in the ring. The \"tecnico\" team of Astral, Eléctrico, Fantasy, Shockercito and Último Dragoncito took on the \"rudo\" team of Demus 3:16, Mercurio, Pequeño Nitro, Pequeño Olímpico and Pierrothito. In the end Shockercito pinned Pierrothito to win the 2015 \"Pequeños Reyes del Aire\" tournament, the first tournament win of Shockercito's career.\n\n"}

It was run on the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia on New Year's Eve, 31 December 2000. The race was run on the full 3.780 km (2.349 mi) Grand Prix circuit used by Formula One for the Australian Grand Prix between 1985-1995, rather than the shorter 3.219 km (2.012 mi) Supercars version of the circuit used since 1999. The Race of a Thousand Years was intended to be run for 1000 kilometres but was stopped short due to time constraints, two hours before midnight, after completing 850 kilometres.\n\nLike the 1999 Le Mans Fuji 1000 km, the Race of a Thousand Years was intended as a precursor to a planned Asia-Pacific Le Mans Series (APLMS) run by Don Panoz and the Professional Sports Car Racing body, just as the Silverstone and Nürburgring events earlier in the season were for the European Le Mans Series (ELMS). After a small amount of entrants for the European series in 2001, as well as a lack of entrants for a third Asian-Pacific exhibition event at the Sepang Circuit, the APLMS plans were cancelled.\n\nThe race was the final of twelve endurance sports car racing rounds of the 2000 American Le Mans Series and took place at the Adelaide Street Circuit on 31 December 2000. The event was the first in a nine-year contract, but was abandoned after only one. Over 135,000 fans attended the race meeting, with almost 70,000 of them in attendance on race day. Organisers expected around 200,000 people in attendance during the race weekend.\n\nBy completing the first 25 laps (and in the lead after having passed team mate Frank Biela on lap 17), Allan McNish became the 2000 American Le Mans Series LMP Drivers' Champion. McNish and team mate Rinaldo Capello completed 225 laps in their Audi Sport North America R8. Australian driver Brad Jones had also qualified the R8 but did not drive in the race. Jones, the team owner and lead driver of Audi's factory backed Super Touring team in Australia, was on stand-by for Scotsman McNish who had injured his back a few days before the race while stepping out of his kilt after a photo shoot and had spent the day before the race flat on his back in bed in a successful effort to be fit to race. The Audi team suffered a setback on the morning of the race when Capello crashed the R8 (painted in crocodile livery in honour of the host country Australia) into the tyre barriers on the outside of turn six. However the team were able to repair the car to allow McNish to start.\n\nThe GTS class was won by Olivier Beretta, Karl Wendlinger and Dominique Dupuy who piloted their Team Oreca Dodge Viper GTS-R (known as a Chrysler Viper in Australia) to 3rd outright, while finishing 5th outright were the GT class winners Dirk Müller and Lucas Luhr in their Dick Barbour Racing Porsche 911 GT3-R.\n\nMcNish (Audi), Portuguese driver Ni Amorim (Viper) and German Luhr (Porsche) set the fastest laps in their respective classes, with McNish's time of 1:25.2189 being the fastest ever non-Formula One race lap of the Adelaide circuit (compared to the outright lap record of 1:15.381 set by Damon Hill in a Williams FW15C-Renault during the 1993 Australian Grand Prix).\nClass winners in bold.\n† – #2 Panoz was disqualified for allowing an unassigned driver, Klaus Graf, to drive the car during the race.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "49030761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=49030761", "title": "Raman Raghav 2.0", "text": "Raman Raghav 2.0\n\nRaman Raghav 2.0 (released internationally as Psycho Raman) is a 2016 Indian neo-noir, psychological-thriller film directed by Anurag Kashyap. Produced by Kashyap, Vikramaditya Motwane, Vikas Bahl, and Madhu Mantena, the film stars Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Vicky Kaushal, and debutante Sobhita Dhulipala. It depicts in eight chapters the cat and mouse chase of serial killer Ramanna (Siddiqui) by corrupt cop Raghavan (Kaushal). Real-life killer Raman Raghav, who operated in Mumbai during the 1960s, inspired the film.\n\nKashyap initially wanted to make a period film about Raman Raghav, but after the commercial failure of \"Bombay Velvet\" (2015), his previous film also set in the 1960s, he realised that he would be unable to find financing. Abandoning the period-piece concept, he co-wrote the film with Vasan Bala, setting it in the contemporary time. The film's music was composed by Ram Sampath, and Varun Grover wrote the lyrics. Jay Oza served as the film's cinematographer and Aarti Bajaj as its editor.\n\n\"Raman Raghav 2.0\" premiered in the Directors' Fortnight section at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. It also screened at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival, the Singapore International Film Festival, the Fantasia International Film Festival, Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival, and the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. The film was released in India on 24 June 2016, received a mostly positive critical response, and proved to be a moderate commercial success, grossing over ₹70 million (US$1.1 million).\n\nIn 2013 Assistant Commissioner of Police Raghavan Amrendra Singh Umbi, a drug addict, makes a visit to a Mumbai drug dealer. However, his plan to purchase drugs is foiled – the dealer and another man have been murdered. Investigating the murders the next day, he receives a hammer followed by an anonymous phone call.\n\nIn 2015 a man named Ramanna surrenders to the police and confesses of killing nine people. He is detained and beaten by the police, but manages to escape with the help of a group of nearby boys. Seeking food at the home of his sister Lakshmi, Ramanna argues with his brother-in-law. After leaving the house he quickly returns and kills the couple and their son. Raghavan is among the police who later investigate the house, where he finds a picture of Ramanna with Lakshmi, confirming Ramanna's involvement in the crime.\n\nRaghavan is in a relationship with Smrutika \"Simi\" Naidu, but he is an abusive partner: he beats her and has coerced her to have three abortions. Ramanna surveils Raghavan and Simi, suggesting some kind of link exists between the cop and the killer. This surveillance escalates into more murders when Ramanna stalks and kills Simi's maid and her husband. After these killings, Ramanna is caught by the police with assistance from an onlooker. However, Ramanna escapes from custody again and kills the man who aided his capture. Raghavan proves to be a killer himself when, on a trip to visit his father, he murders an African drug dealer.\n\nOn a later evening Raghavan picks up another woman named Ankita at a nightclub and brings her to Simi's house. Incapacitated by his drug use, Raghavan is unable to perform sexually, prompting mockery from Ankita. In response he assaults her. Enraged, he searches for the stash of drugs he keeps at the house, but is unable to find it. In this state he confronts Simi and they argue. When Simi demands he leave with Ankita, he strikes Simi; her fall into a glass table kills her instantly.\n\nAnkita locks herself in the bathroom and tries to call for help, but desists when Raghavan threatens and coerces her. He then clears away incriminating evidence and arranges the scene to implicate Ramanna for the murder. He retrieves a tire iron similar to Ramanna's favored murder weapon and smashes Simi's head with it. During these preparations Ankita escapes.\n\nThe next day Ramanna surrenders to Raghavan and claims a deep connection with him: each man is the missing half of the other. Ramanna also reveals his role in the two 2013 murders that opened the film and initiated this connection. He confesses to one of the killings, but witnessed Raghavan kill the other man, and thus began his surveillance of the policeman. Ramanna offers to accept the charge for Simi's murder, but only if Raghavan will kill the eyewitness, Ankita. In the final scene Raghavan's descent into evil matches Ramanna's when he murders Ankita in her home.\n\n\n\"Raman Raghav 2.0\" was inspired by the notorious serial killer Raman Raghav, who had killed several homeless people in Mumbai during the late 1960s. Bludgeoning his victims, he produced widespread panic until he was captured by the Mumbai police and confessed to 41 murders. Raghav was sentenced to death by the Bombay High Court, but his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia allowed his defence to claim mental incapability and gain a change of sentence to life imprisonment. He was sent to Yerawada Central Jail, where he died of kidney failure in 1988 after 19 years of incarceration.\n\nDirector Anurag Kashyap first became interested in the story of Raman Raghav in 1991, when Sriram Raghavan was making a 68-minute film about the killer titled \"Raman Raghav, A City, A Killer\". Kashyap was drawn to the idea of a criminal who was not motivated by familiar human vices. According to him, the killer had \"no moral compass\" or planning to kill someone. He initially wanted to make a trilogy of period films based in Mumbai, the first of which was \"Bombay Velvet\" (2015), then a film on the Nanavati murder case after \"Raman Raghav 2.0\". But after the commercial failure of \"Bombay Velvet\", Kashyap realised that he would not get producers for another period film. He then set the film in contemporary time. The film on the Nanavati case did not materialise. Vasan Bala, the film's co-writer, had written a biopic about Raman Raghav. Kashyap re-wrote that script, taking inspirations from the actual murders. He created a police officer who would be the \"mirror image\" of the killer, as he felt it was difficult to create an honest cop in a contemporary time.\n\nKashyap said that Nawazuddin Siddiqui was his first casting choice for the film because of his \"unimposing body\". Kashyap modeled the character on Raghubir Yadav, who had portrayed Raman Raghav in Sriram Raghavan's 1991 film. For the preparation of the role, Siddiqui isolated himself for days, left his house. He mentioned that he started to \"fear himself\".\n\nVicky Kaushal was called by Kashyap and was give two scenes to prepare in five days for the audition. Kaushal locked himself in the room and isolated himself from phone, internet and newspaper and kept repeating his lines from the scenes. He then gave the audition and was selected for the role of Raghav. Miss Earth India 2013, Sobhita Dhulipala made her acting debut with this film. She had got a call for audition from the casting director Mukesh Chhabra, where she was eventually selected.\n\nThe principal photography began in September 2015 and was completed on 22 November 2015. Kashyap wrote smaller scenes: \"Normal Hindi films have 70 scenes, my films have 220 scenes\". He mentioned that it helped in making the film look vast as the locations kept changing. The title was decided before the script was ready. The crew employed guerrilla filmmaking technique to shoot in real locations of Mumbai. Siddiqui had to deliver a ten-minute monologue in the film. To maintain continuity, he had to be still at the same place while the camera setup was changed from different angles. As a result, he ended up speaking for 300 minutes in the same position. After the shoot, the actor experienced a blackout and could not talk for sometime. Kaushal's character is shown snorting cocaine throughout the film. To make a quasi-cocaine powder, the crew used Glucon-D and Corn Starch. Kaushal practiced inhaling the powder for his scenes in the film.\n\nWhile shooting in some unhygienic surroundings, Siddiqui fell ill and was hospitalised for five days. His wife later said that Siddiqui was repeating his dialogues from the film, while being semi-conscious on bed. Although the diagnosis showed dengue initially, he recovered quickly. He resumed shooting for the film when he was discharged. Siddiqui called the shoot a \"mentally draining\" experience. For a scene, the crew had to shoot it in the restricted area of the Mumbai airport which is guarded by snipers with strict instructions to shoot any infiltrator. Siddiqui was told not to move from his position and the scene was shot. The visual effects and title sequence for the film were executed by Mumbai-based VFX and animation studio, Plexus. Aarti Bajaj and Jay Oza served as the editor and director of photography respectively. \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" was distributed by Reliance Entertainment.\n\nThe film's soundtrack and background score was composed by Ram Sampath, while the lyrics were penned by Varun Grover. The album rights were acquired by T-Series, and it was released on 3 June 2016. The first song launched was \"Qatl-e-aam\", which Sampath described as a \"unique blend of Ghazal & Hard Trance\". Sona Mohapatra, Nayantara Bhatkal, Siddharth Basrur and Ram Sampath provided vocals for the album's songs.\n\nThe film's soundtrack received a mixed response from critics. Swetha Ramakrishnan of \"Firstpost\" called the soundtrack, \"sensual, sinister\" and \"eclectic\". She called the unplugged version of Mohapatra's \"Qatl-E-Aam\" as \"cleaner, more powerful rendition\". Tatsam Mukherjee of \"India Today\" said the music is \"every indie musician's angsty reply to everything wrong with Bollywood 'phillum' music.\" He described Bhatkal's vocal in \"Behooda\" as something that \"lends the song a very gangster-like feel with the continuous violin, keyboard riffs accompanying the chorus.\" Writing for Rediff.com, Aelina Kapoor described the soundtrack as \"unconventional score that matches the filmmaker's unorthodox reputation\". She said the song \"Paani Ka Raasta\" has a poetic touch with dark undertones. Manish Gaekwad thought that \"Raghav's Theme\" has a \"hybrid sound in which techno music meets the sarangi to create a hypnotic instrumental track that explores the psyche of its protagonist.\"\n\nOn 24 April 2016, Kashyap released two teaser posters' of the film through his official Twitter account. They showed a runnel of blood and a pistol attached to a tap. The first look was revealed on April 25, 2016, which had Siddiqui staring at the fourth wall with his red eyes. A second poster was released on May 1. The first teaser of \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" was launched on 6 May 2016, with a runtime of 46 seconds. It was followed by three other teasers which showed a glimpse of the serial killer from the film. The theatrical trailer of \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" was released on 10 May 2016. Before the theatrical release of the film, a series of comic strips were released showing the title character committing several crimes. A user generated song \"I am Ramantic\" was released online which showed people from Mumbai and other cities, who shot their ten-second videos sporting the \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" sunglasses. The film released internationally with the title \"Psycho Raman\".\n\n\"Raman Raghav 2.0\" premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, in the Directors' Fortnight section to positive response. Siddiqui received a standing ovation post the screening of the film. It also premiered at the 2016 Sydney Film Festival, the Singapore International Film Festival, the Fantasia International Film Festival, Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival and the 2016 Indian Film Festival of Melbourne. Before the release, a special screening was held in Mumbai which was attended by actors like Kangana Ranaut, Shweta Tripathi and Abhishek Chaubey. The film was released theatrically on 24 June 2016 in 770 screens across the country. \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" is also available on Netflix. It was released as \"The Mumbai Murders\" on 21 November, 2018 in France.\n\n\"Raman Raghav 2.0\" received mostly positive response from critics upon its theatrical release. Saibal Chattejee of NDTV praised the \"gripping, visceral genre film\", and described the villain as \"a cross between \"No Country for Old Men'\"s Anton Chigurh and \"Se7en'\"s John Doe\". Writing for \"The Hindu\", Namrata Joshi called \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" a \"taut thriller\" that \"takes you on an entertainment high.\" Anna M. M. Vetticad praised Siddiqui for his \"eerie, scary, [and] disgusting\" portrayal of the serial killer, and was particularly impressed by his ability to elicit laughs \"for the matter-of-fact manner in which he goes about his bloody business\". Mohar Basu of \"The Times of India\" wrote, \"It is crude, callous and keeps you in suspense all through\". He felt that it was a difficult film to watch as it made the viewer \"queasy\". Aseem Chhabra shared the view of the film being a \"difficult watch\". Although he was critical of the film's misogyny that made it a \"difficult film to admire\", he praised Siddiqui's performance at his \"creepiest best\". Sweta Kaushal of \"Hindustan Times\" described the film as \"spine-chilling\" and \"pure sadism\".\n\nContrary to the positive critical reviews, Rajeev Masand felt the film \"doesn't bring anything blazingly new or original to the serial killer genre.\" Shubhra Gupta of \"The Indian Express\" wrote that the film was \"atmospheric yet hollow\" and the viewers are \"turned into cringing voyeurs, into reluctant participants, without redemption\". Ananya Bhattacharya of \"India Today\" praised the film but felt that Dhulipala's character was the \"weak link\" as she \"doesn't have much to do\".\n\nAmong the overseas reviewers, Deborah Young of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" noted Kaushal's performance and lack of character-depth of female characters, \"Variety and depth of character are badly lacking on the female front, weakening the whole film.\" Maitland McDonagh commented that the film performs a \"surprisingly deep dive into lust, murder and violent obsession\" and \"delivers a couple of truly suspenseful sequences.\" Guy Lodge from \"Variety\" mentioned it as a \"luridly absorbing serial killer thriller\" and felt Siddiqui's performance has an \"unblinking intensity\". Wendy Ide from \"Screen International\" reviewed the film and called it a \"propulsive and bloodthirsty thriller\" and a \"adrenalised energy which rarely flags.\" But he felt that the film lacks the sense of a \"Manhunter-style battle of wits.\" Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting wrote about the film, \"If you only think of Bollywood when you think of Indian film, Psycho Raman will knock some sense into you, as it stands up with the grittiest American serial killer thrillers.\" Suprateek Chatterjee of \"HuffPost\" mentioned the film as an \"exercise in empty shock value\".\n\n\"Raman Raghav 2.0\" was made on a production budget of . Released on the same day as six other films, including \"Junooniyat\" and the Hollywood film \"\", only \"Raman Raghav 2.0\" earned favourable reviews from the critics.

The emphasis was very much on eclecticism, with Sigue Sigue Sputnik playing against a backdrop of guitar, beats and hip hop music. The club's move to 333 in Shoreditch saw live bands like Clinic, Asian Dub Foundation and Suicide play, as well as boundary-breaking underground electronic music, such as J Saul Kane, Jerry Dammers and Andrew Weatherall. The club segued from the collision of electronic and indie in the late 90s into the more pronounced rock and roll of 2001 onwards.\n\nIn early 2002, Sonic Mook Relocated to the 93 Feet East club on Brick Lane in the East End of London. There it produced exclusive first live performances in London from bands like the New York City punk-funk outfit The Rapture.\n\nIn June 2002, it staged an event at the Institute of Contemporary Arts on The Mall in London, during the Queen's Golden Jubilee. The event, held over four days, launched the second CD in the \"Future Rock & Roll\" series. The new album featured 25 tracks from some of the hottest new bands around, many for the first time on CD. Capturing the energy and attitude of the club night that spawned it and the nascent rock and roll scene in London and New York, it included tracks from The Eighties Matchbox B-Line Disaster, The Liars, The Martini Henry Rifles, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Some Product by Anne McCloy, Fat Truckers, and The Buff Medways.

Nameless Voices asked questions — after Wallenberg's deeds and his fate: \"Do we doing honour a living person or a dead person?\"\n\n2. The Conference I.\n\nSweden in 1944. A reception. Three guests whispering about the professional misses of the young Wallenberg. But three diplomats give his life new meaning. You go to entrust your with the mission to Hungary, to save \"as many Jews as possible\". The warnings of a lady, not to be exploited for foreign targets, can not stop Wallenberg. After initial hesitation, he accepts the order.\n\n3. Railway Station I.\n\nHungary 1944. Wallenberg must helplessly watch as running a German officers and his men the order of the Nazi regime, \"thousands of Jews every day ...\"\n\n4. The Plan I\n\nWallenberg takes a promising tactic: Swedish protective passports \"Will make Jews like Sweden\" and keep them from being deported.\n\n5. Railway Station II\n\nWallenberg again meets the German officer. He manages to rescue some people from the brutality of the Nazis \"Passport hits gun\"\n\n6. The rescued.\n\nA group of saved of Wallenberg shows for the fragility of their destiny in mind: \"Life is not be more than dead.\" Wallenberg realizes that there is every life is individual and very expensive.\n\n7. The Plan II\n\nWallenberg is struggling with self-reproach: \"Not enough! I not act enough!\" He decides to face the evil.\n\n8. Eichmann I.\n\nWallenberg met Adolf Eichmann. He confronted him with the goal of his saving deeds. But Eichmann was a bureaucrat and behaves like a gentleman. With relish, he shows the Wallenberg's limits of its possibilities in mind. And even the diplomats start to doubt the mission of Wallenberg. The time he runs away.\n\n9. Station III.\n\nWallenberg throws himself into the work. But an encounter with a woman he has rescued leaves him utterly disappointed in the meaning of his deeds. She returns her protective passport to Wallenberg — so unbearably she feels the guilt to have survived \"by chance\".\n\n10. The Plan III.\n\nWallenberg gets in panics about the immensity of his task. Once again, he encounters a woman who advises him to pause and reflect on itself.\n\n11. The death march.\n\nHungary, January, 1945 — \"And He made me pass by them round about, and lo! they were exceedingly many on the surface of the valley, and lo! they were exceedingly dry.\" Old testament, Book of Ezekiel (37, 2).\n\nThe last time Eichmann demonstrates his superiority. The war ended. Wallenberg hopes for a fresh start. But at the moment of the freeing appear two Russian soldiers. They summon Raoul Wallenberg for the questioning ...\n\n12. SMERSH.\n\nMoscow, 1945.\nWallenberg has got into the clutches of SMERSH, the Russian counter-intelligence. He is held prisoner in the infamous Moscow state prison Lubjanka. Two Russian officers denied knowing the whereabouts of Wallenberg: \"We do not have him!\"\n\n13. The Conference II\n\nThree diplomats visited Wallenberg. But instead of freeing him, they tell him about his new mission: \"Only half of the war is now won\". As a hero he was caught in the Cold War and more useful than a free man.\n\n14. Gulag I.\n\nKolyma, uncertain time.\nWallenberg is subjected to a brutal interrogation. Meanwhile, the inmates of the Gulag tell each other about their fate and the arbitrariness of the judicial authorities. There are circulating rumors contradictory: \"The Swede is alive. The Swede is dead.\"\n\n15. Gulag II\n\nThree Gulag prisoners believes Wallenberg recognizable as one of their fellow prisoners. His survival also maintains their hope. But Wallenberg not remember — neither of his time in the camp, even to his own identity. \"There is a hole in my head\". The other prisoners reacted with aggression to Wallenberg refusal to accept his role as savior.\n\nIntermezzo.\n\nTraces of Wallenberg are erased.\n\n16. The struggle.\n\nFrom Nothing appears Wallenberg 2, a masterful bugbear of the acts complained of Wallenberg, \"I'm your hero, you will not get rid of me.\"\n\n17. Eichmann II\n\nEichmann is preparing for the penalty. For the last time he taunted Wallenberg: While he was a \"clean finish\" would be granted, would fail a saving Wallenberg's death. Eichmann is hanged.\n\n18. The conference III.\n\nWallenberg hopes explanations to find about his destiny with three diplomats. But these dismiss his doubts about the sense of the history as \"child questions\". Wallenberg silent. But his \"For which?\" does not remain in entirety unanswered. Two survivors remembers their rescue.\n\n19. Wallenberg circus.\n\nFuture generations takes the heritage of Raoul Wallenberg. The public sings praises heroism. And Ronald Reagan appointed him an honorary citizen of the United States. Wallenberg 2 takes the honors of the crowd with pride: \"No trace of a doubt!\"\n\nThe voice of a woman remembers the dead.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3031996", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3031996", "title": "Wine fault", "text": "Wine fault\n\nA wine fault or defect is an unpleasant characteristic of a wine often resulting from poor winemaking practices or storage conditions, and leading to wine spoilage. Many of the compounds that cause wine faults are already naturally present in wine but at insufficient concentrations to be of issue. In fact, depending on perception, these concentrations may impart positive characters to the wine. However, when the concentration of these compounds greatly exceeds the sensory threshold, they replace or obscure the flavors and aromas that the wine should be expressing (or that the winemaker wants the wine to express). Ultimately the quality of the wine is reduced, making it less appealing and sometimes undrinkable.\n\nThere are many causes for the perception in wine faults, including poor hygiene at the winery, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to oxygen, excessive or insufficient exposure of the wine to sulphur, overextended maceration of the wine either pre- or post-fermentation, faulty fining, filtering and stabilization of the wine, the use of dirty oak barrels, over-extended barrel aging and the use of poor quality corks. Outside of the winery, other factors within the control of the retailer or end user of the wine can contribute to the perception of flaws in the wine. These include poor storage of the wine that exposes it to excessive heat and temperature fluctuations as well as the use of dirty stemware during wine tasting that can introduce materials or aromas to what was previously a clean and fault-free wine.\n\nIn wine tasting, there is a big distinction made between what is considered a \"flaw\" and a \"fault\". Wine flaws are minor attributes that depart from what are perceived as normal wine characteristics. These include excessive sulfur dioxide, volatile acidity, \"Brettanomyces\" or \"Brett aromas\" and diacetyl or buttery aromas. The amount to which these aromas or attributes become excessive is dependent on the particular tastes and recognition threshold of the wine taster. Generally, a wine exhibiting these qualities is still considered drinkable by most people. However, some flaws such as volatile acidity and \"Brettanomyces\" can be considered a fault when they are in such an excess that they overwhelm other components of the wine. Wine faults are generally major attributes that make a wine undrinkable to most wine tasters. Examples of wine faults include acetaldehyde (except when purposely induced in wines like Sherry and Rancio), ethyl acetate and cork taint.\n\nThe vast majority of wine faults are detected by the nose and the distinctive aromas that they give off. However, the presence of some wine faults can be detected by visual and taste perceptions. For example, premature oxidation can be noticed by the yellowing and browning of the wine's color. The sign of gas bubbles in wines that are not meant to be sparkling can be a sign of refermentation or malolactic fermentation happening in the bottle. Unusual breaks in the color of the wine could be a sign of excessive copper, iron or proteins that were not removed during fining or filtering. A wine with an unusual color for its variety or wine region could be a sign of excessive or insufficient maceration as well as poor temperature controls during fermentation. Tactile clues of potential wine faults include the burning, acidic taste associated with volatile acidity that can make a wine seem out of balance.\n\nThe oxidation of wine is perhaps the most common of wine faults, as the presence of oxygen and a catalyst are the only requirements for the process to occur. \nOxidation can occur throughout the winemaking process, and even after the wine has been bottled. Anthocyanins, catechins, epicatechins and other phenols present in wine are those most easily oxidised, which leads to a loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as \"flattening\". In most cases compounds such as sulfur dioxide or erythorbic acid are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their organoleptic effect. Apart from phenolic oxidation, the ethanol present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.\n\nAcetaldehyde is an intermediate product of yeast fermentation; however, it is more commonly associated with ethanol oxidation catalysed by the enzyme ethanol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde production is also associated with the presence of surface film forming yeasts and bacteria, such as acetic acid bacteria, which form the compound by the decarboxylation of pyruvate. The sensory threshold for acetaldehyde is 100-125 mg/L. Beyond this level it imparts a \"sherry\" type character to the wine which can also be described as \"green apple\", \"sour\" and \"metallic\". Acetaldehyde intoxication is also implicated in hangovers.\n\nAcetic acid in wine, often referred to as volatile acidity (VA) or \"vinegar taint\", can be contributed by many wine spoilage yeasts and bacteria. This can be from either a by-product of fermentation, or due to the spoilage of finished wine. Acetic acid bacteria, such as those from the genera \"Acetobacter\" and \"Gluconobacter\" produce high levels of acetic acid. The sensory threshold for acetic acid in wine is >700 mg/L, with concentrations greater than 1.2-1.3 g/L becoming unpleasant.\n\nThere are different opinions as to what level of volatile acidity is appropriate for higher quality wine. Although too high a concentration is sure to leave an undesirable, 'vinegar' tasting wine, some wine's acetic acid levels are developed to create a more 'complex', desirable taste. The renowned 1947 Cheval Blanc is widely recognized to contain high levels of volatile acidity.\n\nEthyl acetate is formed in wine by the esterification of ethanol and acetic acid. Therefore, wines with high acetic acid levels are more likely to see ethyl acetate formation, but the compound does not contribute to the volatile acidity. It is a common microbial fault produced by wine spoilage yeasts, particularly \"Pichia anomala\" or \"Kloeckera apiculata\". High levels of ethyl acetate are also produced by lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria.\n\nSulfur is used as an additive throughout the winemaking process, primarily to stop oxidation as mentioned above but also as antimicrobial agent. When managed properly in wine, its presence there is often undetected, however when used recklessly it can contribute to flavour and aroma taints which are very volatile and potent. Sulfur compounds typically have low sensory thresholds.\n\nSulfur dioxide is a common wine additive, used for its antioxidant and preservative properties. When its use is not managed well it can be overadded, with its perception in wine reminiscent of \"matchsticks\", \"burnt rubber\", or \"mothballs\". Wines such as these are often termed \"sulfitic\".\n\nHydrogen sulfide (HS) is generally thought to be a metabolic by-product of yeast fermentation in nitrogen limited environments. It is formed when yeast ferments via the sulfate reduction pathway. Fermenting wine is often supplemented with diammonium phosphate (DAP) as a nitrogen source to prevent HS formation. The sensory threshold for hydrogen sulfide is 8-10 μg/L, with levels above this imparting a distinct \"rotten egg\" aroma to the wine. Hydrogen sulfide can further react with wine compounds to form mercaptans and disulfides.\n\nMercaptans (thiols) are produced in wine by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with other wine components such as ethanol. They can be formed if finished wine is allowed prolonged contact with the lees. This can be prevented by racking the wine. Mercaptans have a very low sensory threshold, around 1.5 µg/L, with levels above causing \"onion\", \"rubber\", and \"skunk\" type odours. Note that dimethyl disulfide is formed from the oxidation of methyl mercaptan.\n\nDimethyl sulfide (DMS) is naturally present in most wines, probably from the breakdown of sulfur containing amino acids. Like ethyl acetate, levels of DMS below the sensory threshold can have a positive effect on flavour, contributing to \"fruityness\", \"fullness\", and \"complexity\". Levels above the sensory threshold of >30 µg/L in white wines and >50 µg/L for red wines, give the wine characteristics of \"cooked cabbage\", \"canned corn\", \"asparagus\" or \"truffles\".\n\nCork taint is a wine fault mostly attributed to the compound 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), although other compounds such as guaiacol, geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 1-octen-3-one, 2,3,4,6-tetrachloroanisole, pentachloroanisole, and 2,4,6-tribromoanisole are also thought to be involved. TCA most likely originates as a metabolite of mould growth on chlorine-bleached wine corks and barrels. It causes \"earthy\", \"mouldy\", and \"musty\" aromas in wine that easily mask the natural fruit aromas, making the wine very unappealing. Wines in this state are often described as \"corked\". As cork taint has gained a wide reputation as a wine fault, other faults are often mistakenly attributed to it.\n\nHeat damaged wines are often casually referred to as \"cooked\", which suggests how heat can affect a wine. They are also known as maderized wine, from Madeira wine, which is intentionally exposed to heat. The ideal storage temperature for wine is generally accepted to be 13 °C (55 °F). Wines that are stored at temperatures greatly higher than this will experience an increased aging rate. Wines exposed to extreme temperatures will thermally expand, and may even push up between the cork and bottle and leak from the top. When opening a bottle of wine, if a trace of wine is visible along the length of the cork, the cork is partially pushed out of the bottle, or wine is visible on the top of the cork while it is still in the bottle, it has most likely been heat damaged. Heat damaged wines often become oxidized, and red wines may take on a brick color.\n\nEven if the temperatures do not reach extremes, temperature variation alone can also damage bottled wine through oxidation. All corks allow some leakage of air (hence old wines become increasingly oxidized), and temperature fluctuations will vary the pressure differential between the inside and outside of the bottle and will act to \"pump\" air into the bottle at a faster rate than will occur at any temperature strictly maintained.\n\nReputedly, heat damage is the most widespread and common problem found in wines. It often goes unnoticed because of the prevalence of the problem, consumers don't know it's possible, and most often would just chalk the problem up to poor quality, or other factors.\n\nLightstruck wines are those that have had excessive exposure to ultraviolet light, particularly in the range 325 to 450 nm. Very delicate wines, such as Champagnes, are generally worst affected, with the fault causing a \"wet cardboard\" or \"wet wool\" type flavour and aroma. Red wines rarely become lightstruck because of the phenolic compounds present within the wine that protect it. Lightstrike is thought to be caused by sulfur compounds such as dimethyl sulfide. In France lightstrike is known as \"goût de lumière\", which translates to \"a taste of light\". The fault explains why wines are generally bottled in coloured glass, which blocks the ultraviolet light, and why wine should be stored in dark environments.\n\nSome insects present in the grapes at harvest inevitably end up in the press and for the most part are inoffensive. Others, notably the Asian lady beetle, release unpleasant smelling nitrogen heterocycles as a defensive mechanism when disturbed. In sufficient quantities these can affect the wine's odor and taste. With an olfactory detection threshold of a few ppb, the principal active compound is isopropyl methoxy pyrazine - this molecule is perceived as rancid peanut butter, bitter and herbal, green bell pepper, or urine like. This is also a naturally occurring compound in Sauvignon grapes and so pyrazine taint has been known to make Rieslings taste like Sauvignon blanc.\n\nThe yeast \"Brettanomyces\" produces an array of metabolites when growing in wine, some of which are volatile phenolic compounds. Together these compounds are often referred to as \"phenolic taint\", \"Brettanomyces character\", or simply \"Brett\". The main constituents are listed below, with their sensory threshold and common sensory descriptors:\n\nGeosmin is a compound with a very distinct \"earthy\", \"musty\", \"beetroot\", even \"turnip\" flavour and aroma and has an extremely low sensory threshold of down to 10 parts per trillion. Its presence in wine is usually derived as metabolite from the growth of filamentous actinomycetes such as \"Streptomyces\", and moulds such as \"Botrytis cinerea\" and \"Penicillium expansum\", on grapes. Wines affected by but not attributed to geosmins are often thought to have earthy properties due to terroir. The geosmin fault occurs worldwide and has been found in recent vintages of red wines from Beaujolais, Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Loire in France. Geosmin is also thought to be a contributing factor in cork taint.\n\nLactic acid bacteria have a useful role in winemaking converting malic acid to lactic acid in malolactic fermentation. However, after this function has completed, the bacteria may still be present within the wine, where they can metabolise other compounds and produce wine faults. Wines that have not undergone malolactic fermentation may be contaminated with lactic acid bacteria, leading to refermentation of the wine with it becoming turbid, \"swampy\", and slightly effervescent or \"spritzy\". This can be avoided by sterile filtering wine directly before bottling. Lactic acid bacteria can also be responsible for other wine faults such as those below.\n\nBitterness taint or \"amertume\" is rather uncommon and is produced by certain strains of bacteria from the genera \"Pediococcus\", \"Lactobacillus\", and \"Oenococcus\". It begins by the degradation of glycerol, a compound naturally found in wine at levels of 5-8 g/L, via a dehydratase enzyme to \"3-hydroxypropionaldehyde\". During ageing this is further dehydrated to acrolein which reacts with the anthocyanins and other phenols present within the wine to form the taint. As red wines contain high levels of anthocyanins they are generally more susceptible.\n\nDiacetyl in wine is produced by lactic acid bacteria, mainly \"Oenococcus oeni\". In low levels it can impart positive \"nutty\" or \"caramel\" characters, however at levels above 5 mg/L it creates an intense \"buttery\" or \"butterscotch\" flavour, where it is perceived as a flaw. The sensory threshold for the compound can vary depending on the levels of certain wine components, such as sulfur dioxide. It can be produced as a metabolite of citric acid when all of the malic acid has been consumed. Diacetyl rarely taints wine to levels where it becomes undrinkable.\n\nGeranium taint, as the name suggests, is a flavour and aroma taint in wine reminiscent of geranium leaves. The compound responsible is \"2-ethoxyhexa-3,5-diene\", which has a low sensory threshold concentration of 1 ng/L. In wine it is formed during the metabolism of potassium sorbate by lactic acid bacteria. Potassium sorbate is sometimes added to wine as a preservative against yeast, however its use is generally kept to a minimum due to the possibility of the taint developing. The production of the taint begins with the conversion of sorbic acid to the alcohol \"sorbinol\". The alcohol is then isomerised in the presence of acid to \"3,5-hexadiene-2-ol\", which is then esterified with ethanol to form \"2-ethoxy-3,5-hexadiene\". As ethanol is necessary for the conversion, the geranium taint is not usually found in must.\n\nMannitol is a sugar alcohol, and in wine it is produced by heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria, such as \"Lactobacillus brevis\", by the reduction of fructose. Its perception is often complicated as it generally exists in wine alongside other faults, but it is usually described as viscous, ester-like combined with a sweet and irritating finish. Mannitol is usually produced in wines that undergo malolactic fermentation with a high level of residual sugars still present. Expert winemakers oftentimes add small amounts of sulfur dioxide during the crushing step to reduce early bacterial growth.\n\nRopiness is manifested as an increase in viscosity and a \"slimey\" or \"fatty\" mouthfeel of a wine. In France the fault is known as \"graisse\", which translates to \"fat\". The problem stems from the production of dextrins and polysaccharides by certain lactic acid bacteria, particularly of the genera \"Leuconostoc\" and \"Pediococcus\".\n\nMousiness is a wine fault most often attributed to \"Brettanomyces\" but can also originate from the lactic acid bacteria \"Lactobacillus brevis\", \"Lactobacillus fermentum\", and \"Lactobacillus hilgardii,\" and hence can occur in malolactic fermentation. The compounds responsible are lysine derivatives, mainly;\nThe taints are not volatile at the pH of wine, and therefore not obvious as an aroma. However, when mixed with the slightly basic pH of saliva they can become very apparent on the palate, especially at the back of the mouth, as \"mouse cage\" or \"mouse urine\".\n\nRefermentation, sometimes called secondary fermentation, is caused by yeasts refermenting the residual sugar present within bottled wine. It occurs when sweet wines are bottled in non-sterile conditions, allowing the presence of microorganisms. The most common yeast to referment wine is the standard wine fermentation yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", but has also been attributed to \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\" and \"Zygosaccharomyces bailii\". The main issues associated with the fault include turbidity (from yeast biomass production), excess ethanol production (may violate labelling laws), slight carbonation, and some coarse odours. Refermentation can be prevented by bottling wines dry (with residual sugar levels <1.0g/L), sterile filtering wine prior to bottling, or adding preservative chemicals such as dimethyl dicarbonate. The Portuguese wine style known as \"vinhos verdes\" used to rely on this secondary fermentation in bottle to impart a slight spritziness to the wine, but now usually uses artificial carbonation.\n\nOrganisms responsible for bunch rot of grape berries are filamentous fungi, the most common of these being \"Botrytis cinerea\" (gray mold) However, there are a range of other fungi responsible for the rotting of grapes such as \"Aspergillus\" spp., \"Penicillium\" spp., and fungi found in subtropical climates (e.g., \"Colletotrichum\" spp. (ripe rot) and \"Greeneria uvicola\" (bitter rot)). A further group more commonly associated with diseases of the vegetative tissues of the vine can also infect grape berries (e.g., Botryosphaeriaceae, \"Phomopsis viticola\"). Compounds found in bunch rot affected grapes and wine are typically described as having mushroom, earthy odors and include geosmin, 2-methylisoborneol, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, fenchol and fenchone.\n\n\n"}
