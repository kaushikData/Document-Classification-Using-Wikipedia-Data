{"id": "25824966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25824966", "title": "2010 Tonight Show conflict", "text": "2010 Tonight Show conflict\n\nThe 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict was a media and public relations conflict involving American television network NBC and two of its then-late-night talk show hosts, Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Leno, the host of long-running franchise \"The Tonight Show\" since 1992, and O'Brien, host of \"Late Night\" since 1993, were strong ratings leaders for the network for much of the decade. When O'Brien's contract neared its end and he was courted by other networks in 2001, NBC extended his contract and guaranteed him he would be the fifth host of \"The Tonight Show\". The network neglected to let Leno know this until his contract extension in 2004, when they informed him he would remain host for five more years and then transition the show to O'Brien in 2009. When that time arrived, other networks conveyed interest in Leno; NBC, in an effort to keep both of its late-night stars, offered Leno a nightly primetime show before the local news and O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\".\n\n\"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"The Jay Leno Show\" failed to attract immediate viewers, and NBC affiliates, seeing their viewership decline, grew restless. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Zucker, alongside chairman Jeff Gaspin and executive Rick Ludwin, created a remedy: move Leno back to his 11:35 pm start time and bump O'Brien a half-hour later, to 12:05 am. O'Brien and his staff were both disappointed and furious; when it became clear O'Brien would not agree to the proposed changes, the situation grew heated. Though not a breach of either host's contract, the change resulted in a public outcry and public demonstrations largely in support of O'Brien. O'Brien's public statement that he would \"not participate in the destruction of \"The Tonight Show\"\" led to negotiations with NBC for a settlement. O'Brien and his staff received US$45 million to walk away from the network, with his final \"Tonight Show\" airing January 22, 2010; Leno was reinstated as host that March, while after a contractual seven-month ban on appearing on television, O'Brien moved to TBS to host \"Conan\".\n\nThe controversy surrounding the scheduling move and the reinstatement of Leno was described by media outlets as \"embarrassing\" for the network and a \"public relations disaster\".\n\nOn May 22, 1992, Johnny Carson, host of NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" for nearly 30 years, retired from the program at the age of 66. The network signed Jay Leno, Carson's \"permanent guest host\", to become the program's fourth host upon Carson's exit. Carson clearly held the view the position should be given to David Letterman, host of his own program, \"Late Night\", which had directly followed Carson's \"Tonight Show\" for ten years. NBC tried to appease both stars, but Letterman left the network in a very public conflict that resulted in the creation of his own competing show on CBS, which began in 1993. \"Late Show with David Letterman\", \"the first truly substantial competing franchise to \"Tonight\"\", regularly won in the Nielsen ratings against Leno for two years, \"proving for the first time that late-night television—and the profits that came with it—could exist beyond \"The Tonight Show\".\"\n\nLeno's \"Tonight Show\" started rocky; prior to Letterman's move, NBC considered matching CBS's offer to allow Letterman to take over from Leno. Letterman beat Leno for nearly two years until August 1995, when Leno welcomed Hugh Grant, who had recently been arrested for soliciting a prostitute (\"What the hell were you thinking?\", Leno asked, to applause), to a previously-booked appearance on \"Tonight\". From that point on, Leno beat Letterman in the ratings, and \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" remained number one for the next 14 years (for Leno's entire run).\n\nNBC chose to continue the \"Late Night\" franchise, and at the suggestion of \"Saturday Night Live\" producer Lorne Michaels, hired Conan O'Brien, a relatively unknown writer for \"SNL\" and \"The Simpsons\", to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with \"Later\" at 1:30 am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. Things improved for the show slowly (mostly revolving around O'Brien's performance) and by 1996, O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to beat competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 years.\n\nAnother notable episode of O'Brien's tenure at the show came when Letterman asked to appear as a guest and say some kind words to him. O'Brien considered this the turning point that changed everything for him, which he mentioned while paying tribute to Letterman in an opening monologue of his own talk show on TBS, which aired the same night as Letterman's final show; O'Brien notably asked his viewers to turn him off and watch Letterman later on in the monologue.\n\nNear the turn of the millennium, NBC's late-night lineup—Leno at 11:35, O'Brien at 12:35, and \"Saturday Night Live\" on the weekend—remained a leader in the ratings. By 2001, O'Brien's contract at NBC had less than a year left to run, and despite arguably \"coming into his own\" in the preceding years, the network was reluctant to pay him on the same scale as other late-night hosts. That year, competing network Fox mounted an \"extended, comprehensive campaign\" to lure O'Brien away from the network, viewing his style suitable for the network's image—\"young, hip, somewhat subversive\". News Corporation chairman and CEO Peter Chernin pursued O'Brien personally, taking him and executive producer Jeff Ross to dinner on several occasions. Fox's plan involved making O'Brien the network's signature star: his program would begin 30 minutes before Leno's and Letterman's (the network's local news broadcasts aired earlier than other networks, allowing the head start) and he would receive cross-promotion via its animated division and on Sunday NFL games. Chernin also offered the host seven times his current pay (a jump from US$3 million to US$21 million). Ross, friends with NBC president and CEO Jeff Zucker, informed him that Fox was aggressively pursuing O'Brien; NBC returned with a more realistic offer, bumping up O'Brien's salary to US$8 million and renewing him through 2005.\n\nWhile many of O'Brien's professional advisors and managers pushed for the Fox deal, O'Brien's desire to one day perhaps take over \"The Tonight Show\" after Leno made it a difficult decision (O'Brien, like many comedians, had grown up idolizing Carson's incarnation). Chernin warned O'Brien that waiting around for Leno to leave would be \"only an invitation to long-term disappointment, and potentially a path toward undermining a promising career.\" Nevertheless, O'Brien signed the deal with NBC in March 2002; the contract extended him through 2005 and most significantly contained an \"explicit Prince of Wales clause\" that solidified the official line of succession: If anything were to happen to Leno, O'Brien would step in. O'Brien's successful hosting job at the 2002 54th Primetime Emmy Awards \"sent out the most resounding message yet about his growing strength as a performer\", and a year later, NBC broadcast O'Brien's tenth anniversary special in primetime. By the time Leno's contract again came up for renewal, a discussion would be needed regarding the future of \"The Tonight Show\". Facing the prospect of attempting to keep both Leno and O'Brien, Zucker made the final call on Leno's deal: \"Yes, we'll extend your deal. But this is your last contract. Time to hand over the keys.\" The plan would extend Leno four additional years, after which he would give \"The Tonight Show\" to O'Brien.\n\nIn February 2004, NBC executive Marc Graboff informed Ross of the conversations, and he in turn ran the idea of waiting four more years to O'Brien, who was immediately receptive. Zucker, along with top late-night executive Rick Ludwin, met with Leno in March at his Burbank studio to discuss the contract extension, and explained the network's stance on handing over the show to O'Brien. While Leno quietly felt both disappointed and befuddled, he noted he did not want to see himself and O'Brien go through the same dilemma he and Letterman faced twelve years earlier, and agreed to the plans. His only request was that NBC wait to announce O'Brien's installment as host well after the extension, to which the executives agreed. While Leno handled the news professionally (to Zucker's relief), he soon headed to \"Tonight Show\" producer Debbie Vickers' office to let her know he felt as if he had just been fired. NBC's announcement of the renewal inevitably led to press speculation on O'Brien's fate; to that end, O'Brien and his team went with the charade, peppering interviews with unclear, vague statements on his future. On September 27, 2004, O'Brien officially signed on to become the next host of \"The Tonight Show\"; NBC allowed the first comment aside from the press release to come from Leno on that night's show. \"'Cause this, you know, this show is like a dynasty,\" Leno said. \"You hold it, and then you hand it off to the next person. And I don't want to see all the fighting and all the 'Who's better?' and nasty things back and forth in the press. So right now, here it is—Conan, it's yours! See you in five years, buddy!\"\n\nLeno was, in reality, overcome with incredulity; in private conversations, he likened the situation to a relationship, noting that he was loyal and still ended up \"heartbroken\". From his perspective, the situation made no sense, as they had remained number one in ratings and consistently brought in money. He began frequently lamenting his confusion to producer Vickers, explaining that he was \"sick of lying\" when people inquired on his retirement. Eventually, he began mulling over his options after \"Tonight\", telling his staff that after the transition, they could simply move to ABC and work at the Disney lot not far from their current Burbank studio. His frustration with the situation came across in his nightly monologues, as more jokes regarding NBC's fourth-place position in the ratings, as well as jokes regarding the future transition, began to appear. While NBC executives tended to not worry in the immediate years following the decision, by 2007 Zucker began to ponder what losing Leno might mean for the network. Around this time, Fox and ABC began to court Leno privately, conveying interest and holding discreet conversations.\n\nMore offers for Leno had sprung up (including a lucrative one for a syndicated program by Sony Pictures Television), and in early 2008, Zucker began to make trips to the Burbank studio in an effort to keep Leno. He gave him numerous suggestions, including a Bob Hope-type deal (high-profile specials), a Sunday night primetime show, or even a nightly cable show on USA Network (owned by NBCUniversal). Executives began to entertain an ideal solution—pay off O'Brien and retain Leno—but Zucker viewed the idea as \"outrageous\". By this time, NBC had already broken ground on a new studio for O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\", renovating Stage 1 at the Universal lot in Universal City, for a reported US$50 million. During a spring lunch meeting with Jeff Ross, NBC sports chief Dick Ebersol advised that O'Brien retire silly antics (such as his signature \"string dance\") and focus more on pitching his show to middle America, which would involve stretching out his monologue. O'Brien, then a year away from inheriting the sacred ground of \"The Tonight Show\", was indeed lengthening his monologue, but viewed suggestions from Ludwin as largely unnecessary: \"I think people are overthinking the twelve-thirty-to-eleven-thirty shift\", he said, instead desiring to put his own stamp on the show's tradition. By this point, O'Brien's popularity, sky high at the time of the contract signing, had gone down slightly. He had opted not to change his act to suit a more mainstream audience (as NBC imagined he would), and CBS's Craig Ferguson, who occupied the post-Letterman slot, had begun to occasionally trump O'Brien in overall ratings. Though internal anxiety increased among executives, most tended to still support O'Brien.\n\nZucker's last resort for Leno was a nightly 10 pm program. As ratings had slipped entirely for 10 pm shows on NBC, he imagined a nightly Leno at 10 could perhaps produce a \"paradigm shift\" and reverse NBC's fortunes. On December 8, 2008, Leno verbally agreed to stay at the network—producing a nightly 10 pm variety show titled \"The Jay Leno Show\"—and phoned ABC and Fox to inform them. Zucker and Ludwin planned to meet with O'Brien later to explain the deal, but as word leaked out to \"The New York Times\", they decided to meet with him directly following that night's show. Following the meeting, Ross and O'Brien met with writers and mulled over the decision. O'Brien instantly felt uneasy, but as he was still in essence receiving \"The Tonight Show\", he remained calm. \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" officially signed off the following February, followed by \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" on May 29. Much of O'Brien's entire staff moved cross-country to Los Angeles to prepare his version of \"The Tonight Show\". He and his staff threw themselves into developing the program, but remained concerned regarding NBC's commitment—or lack of one. Meanwhile, senior level executives at NBC predicted the Leno experiment would flop wildly, getting trumped by hour-long dramas on competing networks and cable.\n\nIn announcing his 10 pm show on \"The Tonight Show,\" Leno said, \"People are asking me, 'What are you going to do after the last show? Are you going to go on vacation?' This kind of stuff. Actually, I'm going to a secluded spot where no one can find me: NBC primetime. As most of you know, we're not really leaving. We're coming back at 10 o'clock in September. It's a gamble. It's a gamble. I'm betting everything that NBC will still be around in 3 months! That is not a given!\"\n\n\"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" pulled in over nine million viewers to its June 1, 2009 premiere, doing extremely well in the coveted young demographics. Critics were generally very favorable; Tom Shales of \"The Washington Post\", once a Conan detractor, wrote that \"There's every indication that O'Brien will be up to the job of his illustrious predecessors.\" Older audiences, however, gradually checked out of the program night by night; seven episodes later, the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" had edged above O'Brien for the first time. While Zucker called O'Brien to reiterate that the generational change was expected, other executives were not as pleased. O'Brien and his team were not happy with the lack of promotion in the show's early weeks. Against the wishes of several PR executives, Zucker authorized a press release proclaiming O'Brien \"the New King of Late Night\", a move that attracted ridicule. Zucker later regretted the decision, and many at O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\" offices were displeased.\n\nOver the following weeks, Zucker grew weary with O'Brien's performance and what he regarded as a booking of the wrong stars. When a controversy erupted over a joke Letterman told regarding politician Sarah Palin's family, Zucker eagerly pushed the O'Brien camp to bring her on their show, eyeing an opportunity to regain viewers and perhaps make it a turning point for a show not doing particularly well. O'Brien disliked the idea, finding it pandering to viewers that would alienate fans and the press, as well as hurt his relationship with Letterman. \"This reaction drove Zucker nuts\", wrote Bill Carter in \"The War for Late Night\". \"As a producer, he knew how to manipulate audiences—that was simply what you did as part of the job. [ ... ] As a boss, he couldn't believe Conan would stand in the way of what was obviously the smart business move—for him and his network.\" Meanwhile, Letterman continued to score higher ratings than O'Brien with regularity; his fall interview with President Barack Obama topped \"The Tonight Show\" by over 2.6 million viewers, and the next week, a scandal involving attempted extortion and personal affairs made him the talk of the country. By August, \"The Tonight Show\" was still losing to Letterman in total viewers, but, owing to O'Brien's appeal to a young audience, maintained its lead in the touted demographics.\n\nMeanwhile, Leno was candid regarding his plans for his new show: \"Even though it's ten o'clock, we're going to pretend it's eleven thirty.\" \"The Jay Leno Show\" premiered on September 14, 2009, featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Kanye West (just following his infamous rant against Taylor Swift at the MTV Video Music Awards) as guests. The program racked up 18.4 million viewers, doing much better than O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\" debut in both overall numbers and young demographics. Some critics were harsh to Leno's program, with many viewing it as a rehash of the show he had just left. Mary McNamara of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called a commercial funnier than the show's whole, saying, \"This is the future of television? This wasn't even a good rendition of television past.\" By the show's second week, with it airing directly opposite season premieres, \"The Jay Leno Show\" saw its audience size fall to six million viewers. As the weeks wore on, producer Vickers noticed that NBC's plan—to save the best segments, such as Leno's signature \"Headlines\", for last in order to provide a strong lead-in for local news—was possibly hurting the program. One month in, Leno often only made third place, and executives became more uneasy.\n\nRatings for NBC affiliates' local news broadcasts at 11 began to slip by mid-October, especially on NBC owned-and-operated stations in the largest markets, creating high anxiety for the network. \"The Tonight Show\" still retained a slightly higher share of the coveted 18–24 demographic against Letterman, but saw those numbers slip even more when \"The Jay Leno Show\" began. Affiliates began to complain, and in addition to a domino effect on the local news, O'Brien, and \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" (O'Brien's successor at 12:30), the disastrous ratings for Leno had damaged NBC's existing primetime lineups. This cascading effect caused by the lowered 10 pm lead-in was so significant that local news viewership fell an average of twenty-five percent nationwide, with the decline in some markets being as high as fifty percent. By November, two months after the debut of \"The Jay Leno Show\", ratings for \"The Tonight Show\" were brought down \"roughly two million viewers a night year-to-year\" from when Leno hosted the program. Clearing the 10 pm time period for Leno also damaged relations with the producers of shows that previously occupied that slot, such as \"Law & Order: SVU\" Dick Wolf. Leno offered an October 29 interview to \"Broadcasting & Cable\", which included a notable exchange on the possibility of ever returning to the 11:35 slot: \"If it were offered to me, would I take it? If that's what they wanted to do, sure. That would be fine if they wanted to.\" Industry trades were abuzz over the 11:35 comment, and when Conan sidekick Andy Richter called the move less than \"classy\" in a chat with TV Squad, Leno called Ludwin to complain.\n\nAs most programs went into repeats in December, the staff at Leno, notably Vickers, had focused on grabbing big-name guests for that month in an effort to save the show; these efforts were cut short when she was informed they had \"until the end of November\". Affiliate calls came at an alarming rate, and research analysis revealed O'Brien's drastically reduced median age for \"The Tonight Show\"—age 56 to 46—could possibly reflect that he was too \"niche\" for the earlier time. Any effort to take Leno off the air was halted by his contract, which had an enormously unusual catch in that Leno had signed a \"pay-and-play\" contract (as opposed to the usual \"pay-or-play\") guaranteeing NBC would both air his program and pay him for up to two years. On November 6, NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin received an email from the sales division with a suggestion to cancel O'Brien and reinstate Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show\". Upon Gaspin's legal interpretation of Leno's contract, the option to simply move Leno back to \"The Tonight Show\" became relevant. When very poor ratings came in for the November \"sweeps\" period, affiliates became persistent and board members demanded something be done regarding the 10 pm lead-in.\n\nIf something were not done by January, the affiliates reasoned, they would instate syndicated programming or move up their news broadcasts and pre-empt Leno. Desperate for a decision, Ludwin, Gaspin, and Zucker kicked around possible solutions for their dilemma, such as cutting Leno to a few nights per week. In an attempt to alleviate the situation, Vickers moved the most popular comedy segments to the second act of \"The Jay Leno Show\", moving their \"10 at 10\" segment to later in the broadcast. Gaspin again received the suggestion to put Leno back at 11:35, and soon began working on a plan to cut \"The Jay Leno Show\" to a half-hour, leading into Conan's \"Tonight Show\" around midnight. From their perspective, the biggest casualty in this scenario would be \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", which would get bumped to 1 am. The reconfigured lineup could start in March 2010, following NBC's coverage of the Winter Olympics. Zucker preferred a plan for Leno to include an occasional guest and comedy piece, while Dick Ebersol favored returning to the way it once was, with Leno at 11:35 and O'Brien at 12:35. Gaspin laid out his plan to Zucker one week before Christmas, but both agreed to wait it out for the new year, as to not \"ruin anybody's holiday season\".\n\nThe plan moved forward after confirmation that O'Brien's contract did not guarantee a strict 11:35 start time (a loophole included primarily to accommodate sports pre-emptions and specials such as the network's New Year coverage). Gaspin planned to disclose the news to Leno first, and then, if all went well, report it to O'Brien the next week. When Gaspin met with Leno and Vickers and laid out the proposal, the response was positive, although they questioned how such a plan would work. Gaspin reasoned that the company was in a desperate position, and he indicated his confidence that O'Brien would too go along with the changes. While Leno embraced the plan, Vickers was unnerved; without a guest or music act she might have no studio audience, which could have disastrous consequences for Leno. In order to meet with O'Brien the following Monday, Gaspin was forced to cancel a meeting with the affiliate board, but promised them that by doing so, he would have an answer to the 10 pm problem that would \"likely be something [they'd be] happy with\". Following his January 6 show, O'Brien met with manager Gavin Polone and lamented his anxiety with the ratings: \"I just think [Leno] is going to hurt me in some way.\"\n\nNews regarding Leno leaked to FTV Live by the following morning, which set the Internet abuzz with rumors regarding both Leno's and O'Brien's fates. Gaspin scheduled an immediate meeting with Ross and O'Brien as soon as they arrived and explained the proposed changes. \"I know how hard I worked for this\", responded O'Brien. \"It was promised to me. I had a shitty lead-in.\" Following the tense 15-minute meeting, O'Brien and Ross returned to the \"Tonight\" studio. TMZ reported on the story with a headline reading, \"NBC Shakeup; Jay Leno Comes Out on Top.\" O'Brien called an emergency staff meeting and assured all that they had not been canceled and all would be fine. The TMZ story deeply bothered O'Brien (\"the timing of the leak to TMZ—coming so soon after a story that Jay had been canceled—screamed of an attempt at diversionary action\"), and he and Ross reasoned that they indeed were the last to be told of the changes.\n\nBy the following morning, both men determined that they would have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with \"We've got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show.\" Polone viewed the move as a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on \"The New York Times\" website that Fox had an \"overt interest\" in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that \"I obviously couldn't satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That's why I came up with this compromise.\" Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen, saying \"I'm going to tell you right now that I can pay him or play him. I can ice you guys.\" On the following Monday's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, \"You keep that up, and this monologue won't start until 12:05.\"\n\nRosen suggested they hire \"perhaps the best known (and most feared) litigation lawyer in Hollywood\", Patty Glaser, to help grasp the situation. Following discussions on Leno's contract during a post-show conference, Glaser turned her attention to O'Brien for his opinion. He expressed his desire to write a statement expressing his feelings on the matter, and after hearing what he would possibly say in such a statement, Glaser agreed to the idea, although Ross was initially reluctant. O'Brien went without sleep that night, crafting his statement obsessively. He returned to the studio the following morning, listening as the lawyers and Glaser read over the statement (it remained largely unchanged before publication). According to \"The War for Late Night\", Glaser found \"the statement as ideal for their purposes. It laid out Conan's point of view unequivocally, but without compromising his legal options. Nothing in there overtly said he was quitting, so he could not be accused of forsaking his contractual obligations.\"\n\nO'Brien's press release went out mid-day on January 12, which he addressed to \"People of Earth\":\n\nFor 60 years the \"Tonight Show\" has aired immediately following the late local news. I sincerely believe that delaying the \"Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn't the \"Tonight Show\". [ ... ] So it has come to this: I cannot express in words how much I enjoy hosting this program and what an enormous personal disappointment it is for me to consider losing it. My staff and I have worked unbelievably hard and we are very proud of our contribution to the legacy of \"The Tonight Show\". But I cannot participate in what I honestly believe is its destruction.\n\nAccording to \"The War for Late Night\", \"the 'People of Earth' letter—the manifesto, as NBC came to call it—changed the tone. This wasn't just Conan saying no; it was Conan saying no, and you're wrong, and, by the way, go fuck yourselves.\" However, the moment that \"represented the point of no return\" came that Wednesday night, as a \"clearly liberated\" O'Brien joked in his monologue that \"I'm trying very hard to stay positive here, and I want to tell you something. This is honest. Hosting \"The Tonight Show\" has been the fulfillment of a lifelong dream for me. And I just want to say to the kids out there watching: You can do anything you want in life. Yeah, yeah—unless Jay Leno wants to do it, too.\" Following the joke, Leno called Gaspin, asking, \"Why the fuck am I giving up a half hour for this guy?\" Conversations changed to focus on what O'Brien would require to resolve the matter, and parties began to discuss a settlement.\n\nPublic reaction was overwhelmingly in favor of O'Brien during the conflict; in the days following the switch announcement, 88% of related Twitter posts expressed support for O'Brien. Over one million people joined the two most prominent Facebook groups supporting O'Brien: \"Team Conan\" and \"I'm With Coco\" (referring to an on-air nickname applied to O'Brien during his \"Tonight Show\" reign). Artist Mike Mitchell designed a poster reminiscent of the Obama \"Hope\" poster, depicting O'Brien superimposed with an American flag in the background with the caption \"I'm With Coco\". The poster was widely circulated and displayed on the web and at various rallies. The color orange also became the choice of color for fans of Conan, referencing his light orange hair. O'Brien's overnight ratings began to shoot up (much to NBC's chagrin), and the viral support for O'Brien only increased by the week of his final shows.\n\nRallies in support of O'Brien were organized outside NBC studios across the United States, notably in Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, and New York City. O'Brien briefly appeared at a January 18 rally outside the \"Tonight Show\" studio, after which he gave the crowd free pizza. The show's announcer Andy Richter and drummer Max Weinberg also made an appearance during the rally to speak to the crowd from atop the \"Tonight Show\" studio, and Tonight Show Band trombonist Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg was driven around the crowd in a Popemobile-style vehicle. American Red Cross representatives were at a number of the rallies to collect money for the Haiti earthquake relief.\n\nMany in Hollywood expressed support for O'Brien, including Roger Ebert, Sarah Silverman, Will Ferrell, Jim Gaffigan, Jeff Garlin, Jim Carrey, Aziz Ansari, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Paul F. Tompkins, Doug Benson, Ahmir \"?uestlove\" Thompson, Alyssa Milano, Chris Parnell, Marlee Matlin, Judd Apatow Ben Stiller, Ice-T, Matthew Perry, Norm Macdonald, Howard Stern, and Ricky Gervais. \"Saturday Night Live\"'s Seth Meyers addressed the controversy on the program's \"Weekend Update\" segment, joking that the conflict showed that \"you don't need Cinemax to see someone get screwed on TV\", and then proceeding to defend O'Brien. Meyers went on to sarcastically point out that if they did end up moving \"The Tonight Show\", it would mean \"Late Night\" would end and host Jimmy Fallon would likely end up coming back to \"Update\" (and presumably reclaim his job from Meyers).\n\nNumerous media outlets offered support of O'Brien, such as Gawker and \"The Examiner\", as well as less usual outlets such as advertisements running on Adult Swim. Numerous parody videos appeared on sites like YouTube and Funny or Die in favor of O'Brien.\n\nLeno faced heated criticism and increasing negative publicity for his perceived role in the timeslot conflict, with some critics predicting that his reputation—along with those of Jeff Zucker and NBC as a whole—had been permanently damaged by the incident. Critics pointed to the 2004 \"Tonight Show\" clip wherein Leno claimed he would allow O'Brien to take over without incident. Actor and comedian Patton Oswalt was among the first celebrities to openly voice disappointment with Leno, saying, \"Comedians who don't like Jay Leno now, and I'm one of them, we're not like, 'Jay Leno sucks;' it's that we're so hurt and disappointed that one of the best comedians of our generation ... willfully has shut the switch off.\" Rosie O'Donnell was among O'Brien's most vocal and vehement supporters, calling Leno a \"bully\" and his actions \"classless and kind of career-defining\". Howard Stern was also a harsh critic of Leno before and following the timeslot change announcement; Stern had previously appeared on \"Late Night\" in 2006 and told O'Brien that he felt it was unlikely that Leno would ever willingly give up \"Tonight\" to anyone. The 67th Golden Globe Awards, which aired on NBC during the heat of O'Brien's settlement negotiations on January 17, featured numerous jokes on the controversy by Tina Fey and Tom Hanks, as well as show host Ricky Gervais who quipped \"Let's get on with it before NBC replaces me with Jay Leno.\"\n\nAdditional criticism stemmed from the fact that the circumstances O'Brien found himself in recalled a similar dilemma that faced Leno toward the end of 1992. Only months into his hosting job on \"The Tonight Show\", NBC considered reversing their decision to choose Leno over Letterman. Leno was aghast and angry that NBC refused to exhibit clear commitment to him as the franchise's new host, and expressed this disappointment publicly. He also made explicit that he would leave the network if he was asked to move back an hour to accommodate Letterman, saying \"I'm not going to do some little happy hour from Omaha at 12:30.\" \n\nCommentators also faulted Leno for what they perceived as a disingenuous attempt on the host's part to forge an \"everyman\" persona in the way he carried himself throughout the controversy. During the episode of \"The Jay Leno Show\" that aired after it was made public that Leno had been offered the 11:35 time slot back, Leno portrayed himself as an ingenuous employee merely following NBC's instructions, making a point of stating \"I don't have a manager, I don't have an agent\" and referring to his preference of making direct, \"handshake\" deals. Despite his claim of having no representation, Leno retained an agent (Steve Levine of International Creative Management), a publicist, and entertainment lawyers.\n\nComedian Bill Burr found that Leno's ambition to take back \"The Tonight Show\" was less objectionable than his \"passive-aggressive\" behavior and the \"powerless\" public image Leno put forth instead of \"owning up\" to his maneuverings. Burr argued that NBC \"never gave [Conan] \"The Tonight Show\"\" in terms of network support, saying, \"When Jay got \"The Tonight Show\", he didn't have to follow Johnny [Carson] bombing for an hour. [ ... ] Leno struggled for eighteen months before he got going, and he got to go on after a hit show.\"\n\nComedian Jeff Garlin accused NBC of being \"cheap\", suggesting that the network tempted O'Brien with his dream job of hosting \"The Tonight Show\" because they did not want him to go to a competitor, but neither did they want to match what the competitors were offering. Garlin accused Leno of undermining O'Brien's incipient \"Tonight Show\" by taking the 10 pm slot. Garlin stated that while Leno had been nice to him over the years, the host displayed \"no character\" by taking the timeslot back. Garlin vowed never to appear on Leno's \"Tonight Show\" thereafter.\n\nIn an essay for the \"Wall Street Journal\", Nathan Rabin wrote that Leno had \"raced past the reviled likes of Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia on the list of popular stand-ups hated by comedians and comedy writers.\" Bill Zehme, the co-author of Leno's autobiography \"Leading with My Chin\", told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"The thing Leno should do is walk, period. He's got everything to lose in terms of public popularity by going back. People will look at him differently. He'll be viewed as the bad guy.\" Joe Queenan from the \"Wall Street Journal\" went further in his criticism of Leno, jokingly comparing the controversy to Adolf Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia.\n\nDavid Letterman was one of the more adamant critics of NBC and Leno's handling of the conflict. He noted that, \"We went through our own version of this, 17, 18 years ago\", and he ridiculed Leno's recent \"state of the network address\", wherein Leno pleaded for viewers not to \"blame Conan\", with Letterman noting, \"In the thousands and thousands of words that have been printed about this mess, who has blamed Conan?\"\n\nJon Stewart of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show\" reflected on the controversy, saying, \"At least we don't have to deal with Jeff Zucker. That guy's like the Cheney of television, shooting shows in the face.\" Stewart also shouted \"Team Conan\" as his \"Moment of Zen\" at the end of the January 21 episode of \"The Daily Show\". Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's \"The Colbert Report\" asked guest Morgan Freeman to read a list of \"untrustworthy things\", one of which paraphrased a statement made by Leno in 2004, \"Conan: The 11:30 slot? Yours.\"\n\nAt ABC, Jimmy Kimmel of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" donned a gray wig and fake chin, performing his entire January 12 show in character as Leno. With his bandleader Cleto Escobedo parodying Leno's bandleader Kevin Eubanks, Kimmel started out his monologue with \"It's good to be here on ABC. Hey, Cleto, you know what ABC stands for? Always Bump Conan.\" He also referenced the \"People of Earth\" letter, noting how O'Brien declined to participate in the \"destruction\" of \"The Tonight Show\", commenting as Leno that \"Fortunately, though, I will! I'll burn it down if I have to!\" Leno called Kimmel the next morning to discuss the bit, and at the end of the call, Leno suggested Kimmel come over and appear on his show. When his booking department called to confirm his appearance on a \"10 at 10\" segment (during which Leno asked 10 questions to a guest appearing remotely via satellite), Kimmel agreed immediately. When he received the questions for his January 14 appearance—such as \"What's your favorite snack junk food?\"—he realized Leno intended to neutralize the scathing parody and paint the two as friends.\n\nKimmel, however, was upfront with wanting to discuss the fiasco at hand, and during his appearance attempted to steer the questions that way; when asked about his favorite prank, he responded, \"I think the best prank I ever pulled was, I told a guy once, 'Five years from now I'm going to give you my show.' And then when the five years came, I gave it to him and I took it back, almost instantly.\" Later in the segment, when Leno asked, \"Ever order anything off the TV?\" Kimmel replied, \"Like when NBC ordered your show off the TV?\"\n\nFollowing similar remarks to more questions, Kimmel closed the segment with this comment: \"Listen, Jay. Conan and I have children. All you have to take care of is cars! We have lives to lead here! You've got eight hundred million dollars! For God's sakes, leave our shows alone!\" Leno never fought back and accepted the bit as comedy (he ascribed it as Kimmel attempting to score some publicity), but producer Vickers was furious.\n\nKimmel discussed the appearance during an interview with Marc Maron for the latter's podcast in 2012. Kimmel stated that he felt O'Brien was not given a proper chance, but that he was also motivated by his own history with Leno. According to Kimmel, Leno had some years prior been in serious discussions with ABC about the possibility of jumping ship from NBC. During this period, Leno initiated a friendship with Kimmel, wanting to ensure that they would be on good terms if the move was made. (Under that scenario, Leno would have taken Kimmel's time slot and become his lead-in.) However, after Leno made the arrangement to remain at NBC, \"those conversations were gone,\" according to Kimmel. Realizing that Leno's relationship with him had been artificial, Kimmel felt \"worked over,\" reasoning that Leno was using the ABC discussions as a bargaining tactic to try to get his old job back.\n\nThe only late night host who remained neutral was Jimmy Fallon, calling O'Brien and Leno \"two of my heroes and two of my friends\". He later joked that, \"There's been three hosts of \"Late Night\": David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and me. And if there's one thing I've learned from Dave and Conan, it's that hosting this show is a one-way ticket to \"not\" hosting \"The Tonight Show\".\" Ironically, Jimmy Fallon was selected to replace the retiring Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in February 2014.\n\nThe comedians who came out in defense of Leno were far fewer and tended to have a professional or personal relationship with the host. Speaking to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Jerry Seinfeld rebuffed the idea that NBC deserved blame and chastised O'Brien for pointing fingers:\n\n\"What did the network do to him?\" Seinfeld asked. \"I don't think anyone's preventing people from watching Conan. Once they give you the cameras, it's on you. I can't blame NBC for having to move things around. I hope Conan stays, I think he's terrific. But there's no rules in show business, there's no [referees].\"\n\nThe irony of Seinfeld's stance was noted by at least one publication, as \"Seinfeld\" had itself weathered a rocky beginning thanks to the patience of NBC executive Rick Ludwin, the benefit of a strong lead-in (\"Cheers\"), and years to develop its audience as opposed to O'Brien's six months.\n\nJim Norton, who was a frequent contributor to Leno's shows, touched on the controversy repeatedly in interviews and on \"The Opie & Anthony Show\", calling the harsh criticism of Leno \"amazing\" and suggesting that Leno declining to walk away after stating otherwise was no worse than O'Brien \"actually trying to force Jay out by telling the agents, 'If Conan doesn't get \"The Tonight Show\", he's leaving the network.'\"\n\nNBC executives served as Leno's chief defenders, with Dick Ebersol, chairman of NBC Universal Sports, being particularly aggressive. Calling Leno's detractors \"chicken-hearted and gutless,\" he summarized the late night situation as an \"astounding failure\" by O'Brien and further characterized O'Brien's and Letterman's barbed jokes about their rival as \"professional jealousy.\" Addressing the common point about Conan's weak lead-in hurting his ability to build an audience in a different timeslot, Ebersol dismissed it as a \"specious argument.\"\n\nIn an interview with Marc Maron that summer, O'Brien's longtime sidekick Andy Richter noted the contradiction between Ebersol's comments and the actions of the network. The demonstrable impact of \"The Jay Leno Show\" on the ratings of local news across the country was the direct cause of the cancellation of \"The Jay Leno Show\", and gave lie to Ebersol's implication that lead-ins are irrelevant. Leno's \"Tonight Show\", in contrast, had always enjoyed healthy lead-ins courtesy of a strong NBC primetime line-up. Furthermore, the network would have reportedly faced a US$150 million penalty in order to release Leno from his contract, making O'Brien the far less expensive host to get rid of.\n\nLeno himself was among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers \"destructive to the franchise\" despite O'Brien's success in the advertiser-friendly demographics combined with his significantly smaller salary. Moreover, Leno's assessment of O'Brien's performance less than three months prior had been significantly different: \"Personally, I think Conan is doing fine. He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has a lot of other things going that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing. It's a little too early to tell.\"\n\nDiscussions neared completion regarding a financial settlement by January 14, and were expected to be in place following O'Brien's final week of shows—January 18–22—a concession O'Brien pushed to give his program a proper farewell. Movement on the settlement slowed when run by General Electric (GE) executives, then-owners of NBCUniversal. NBC had several requests, among those that he not bring Howard Stern on the show his final week (which the O'Brien camp found slightly comical), and that they see the show's final week of scripts (which O'Brien never sent). Talks for much of the rest of the week went nowhere, and a Saturday \"New York Post\" story ran claiming that O'Brien's staff felt \"betrayed\" by his actions. The article claimed that the staff did not understand why O'Brien could not just take the 12:05 slot in order to keep their jobs, and that he was instead controlled by his ego. O'Brien was infuriated by the story—which he assumed to be a direct plant from NBC—as nearly all of his staff agreed he should walk. He was personally appalled that the network challenged his character, as stressing severance for his employees was enormously important to him (he had paid them out of his own pocket during the writer's strike three years earlier).\n\nNBC added more requests, which the O'Brien camp refused as unreasonable, such as the right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (e.g., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host to walk away from the network. Following his January 20 episode, O'Brien remained at the studio until the early hours of the morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.\n\nIn all, O'Brien received a US$45 million deal to leave NBC. O'Brien received pay for the remaining two years of his contract (amounting to US$33 million), with additional payments to Jeff Ross, Andy Richter, and bandleader Max Weinberg. The severance pay for his staff was above standard GE levels (amounting in all to US$12 million), which O'Brien had stressed. O'Brien paid around 50 stagehands and various crew members at least six weeks severance pay out of his own pocket, as NBC gave those particular staffers nothing in the settlement. The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees said that they were \"very happy\" with how O'Brien treated his employees during the conflict. The contract contained a clause prohibiting O'Brien from making negative remarks about NBC for a certain amount of time; it did not, however, contain the previously rumored \"mitigation clause\", in which NBC would be able to keep some of the severance pay after O'Brien found a new network. It stipulated that he could return to television on another network no earlier than September 1, 2010.\n\nThe conflict only provided more comedy material for O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\" during its final episodes. Among other bits, O'Brien put the show up for sale on Craigslist (\"Guaranteed to last for up to seven months; designed for 11:35, but can easily be moved!\"), and then himself; looked back at clips from the show's seven-month tenure that were dubbed \"Classic \"Tonight Show\" Moments\"; and designed a bit to seem as though he were spending absurd amounts of NBC's money, such as customizing a Bugatti Veyron, playing audio and video clips with expensive rebroadcast rights, and using a purported \"rare ground sloth\" to spray Beluga caviar on what was presented as an original Picasso. Because the segments aired in days immediately following the 2010 Haiti earthquake while national fundraising efforts (including some spearheaded by NBC) were ongoing, O'Brien received criticism for wasting resources. In response to the outcry over the expense of these sketches, O'Brien explained that the segments were indeed jokes, and many of the props were either counterfeits or borrowed in exchange for promotional consideration.\n\nThe guest roster for O'Brien's final show on January 22—Tom Hanks, Steve Carell and original first guest Will Ferrell—was regarded by O'Brien as a \"dream lineup\"; in addition, Neil Young performed his song \"Long May You Run\" and, as the show closed, was joined by Beck, Ferrell (dressed as Ronnie Van Zant), Billy Gibbons, Ben Harper, O'Brien, Viveca Paulin, and The Tonight Show Band to perform the Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Free Bird\".\n\nIn his final moments on air, O'Brien stated that between \"Saturday Night Live\", \"Late Night\", and \"The Tonight Show\", he had worked for NBC for over 20 years, and that he was \"enormously proud of the work they have done together\"; he then thanked NBC for the first time since announcing his intention to quit. O'Brien said his decision to quit as host was \"the hardest thing [he] ever had to do\". He praised and gave thanks to his staff, and thanked his fans (specifically those who participated in the Los Angeles rally during periods of heavy rain) for their overwhelming support. He ended the show by offering heartfelt advice to his viewers in his farewell address, stating:\n\nAll I ask of you is one thing ... I ask this particularly of the young people who watch. Please don't be cynical. I hate cynicism. For the record, it's my least favorite quality and it doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. I'm telling you, amazing things will happen.\n\nFollowing the taping, the studio set was used one final time for a party thrown by staff. O'Brien's monologue spot from the floor was framed and signed by his staff as a gift, which touched O'Brien. 10.3 million people watched the final episode of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\", a notably high number for live late-night viewing and for a Friday night. The final episode scored a 7.0 household rating and a 4.4 rating in the 18–49 demo. Not only did O'Brien's final show beat all late night competition, it outscored all prime time shows in the 18–49 demo from that night and the night before. The network confirmed that Leno would officially resume as host of \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, and NBC aired reruns from O'Brien's time as host until the network began airing the Olympics on February 15.\n\nLeno's first \"Tonight Show\" back pulled in 6.6 million viewers, and his margin over Letterman again held for much of the rest of his run until his second \"Tonight Show\" departure in 2014. While his numbers were down from his original incarnation of \"The Tonight Show\", \"It's as if a collective erase button was pushed\", said Robert Thompson, professor of television at Syracuse University, \"with the usual suspects back in their usual locations—except Conan is gone.\"\n\nAccording to NBC, if O'Brien continued hosting, it would have been the first year that \"The Tonight Show\" would have actually lost money, which Leno later contended was damaging to the franchise. This assertion was scorned by skeptical critics as it was calculated that Conan's \"Tonight Show\" would have made significantly more money in advertising than Leno's show did, due to his more favorable youth demographic numbers. Also Leno's larger staff, higher production costs, and higher salary would have by all accounts made Leno's \"Tonight Show\" more costly. O'Brien and Ross also challenged this accusation, concluding that in order for NBC to use such figures, they must have folded in the cost of erecting the new studio/offices, alongside startup costs. At NBC, most young employees tended to support O'Brien and joined the \"I'm with Coco\" Facebook groups; NBC later asked all employees to rescind their membership in any O'Brien-supporting pages. Similar action came when any effort to mention O'Brien's tenure was whitewashed from company history.\n\nGaspin was happy with the settlement, but nevertheless agreed with one of O'Brien's points—that his show had no time to grow: \"Could it have grown? Absolutely ... We just couldn't give him the time.\" Zucker, in an interview with Charlie Rose, defended his strategy but noted that both shows were a mistake. Zucker, who had known O'Brien since their days at Harvard and was very close friends with Ross, was very disappointed with how events played out, although he viewed it as necessary. Leno, in an attempt to repair his public perception, granted an interview to Oprah Winfrey on January 25; he stripped himself of any blame for O'Brien's disappointment, noting that it was all about ratings, and also confirmed that he told a \"white lie\" in 2004 when he guaranteed \"The Tonight Show\" to O'Brien. In a reference to a 2007 Super Bowl commercial starring Letterman and Winfrey (the two had feuded for years prior), Letterman, Leno, and Winfrey all appeared in a spot airing during Super Bowl XLIV in February 2010. The ad—Letterman's idea—was the first time the late-night hosts had met since their own 1992 debacle. In it, Letterman and Leno sit on opposite sides of Winfrey watching the game; Letterman deems it \"the worst Super Bowl party ever\" due to Leno's inclusion, and Winfrey tells him to \"be nice\", resulting in Leno quipping \"Oh, he's just saying that 'cause I'm here.\" The clip stirred a frenzy, with commentators speculating that Leno had been \"green-screened\" into the picture.\n\nLetterman had initially wanted O'Brien to be in the promo as well, but O'Brien firmly rejected it, saying \"No fucking way I'm doing that. It's not a joke to me—it's real.\" O'Brien was sure his agreement prohibited television appearances for several months, but gathered NBC would be only too happy to allow him a one-time reprieve for the ad, as it was to improve Leno's image. O'Brien, by this point, was planning a live tour with his staff that would take him on the road, and had also created a Twitter account which flourished (NBC closely monitored the account for anti-Leno sentiments). After about one hour online, O'Brien's number of Twitter followers had rocketed past the 30,000 followers of the official Jay Leno account, and he held over 300,000 followers in under 24 hours; he surpassed the one million mark in May 2010. Many speculated that O'Brien would sign a deal with Fox for a late-night program; Comedy Central and HBO had also expressed interest in O'Brien. Fox's deal moved slowly and they eventually withdrew their offer due to station resistance, the daunting financial investment, and opposition from Roger Ailes.\n\nO'Brien eventually signed with cable network TBS in April, with his next program, \"Conan\", set to debut in November. The move prompted industry surprise; online blog Vulture commented that \"Conan will now be featured as a lead-in for \"Lopez Tonight\" on TBS. It's not just basic cable, it's unsexy basic cable.\" His nationwide comedy tour, The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, began on April 12 and ran through June 14. A documentary shot during that time, \"Conan O'Brien Can't Stop\", as well as a May \"60 Minutes\" interview, prompted some observers to deem him \"whiny\". \"Vanity Fair\" James Wolcott said O'Brien \"came off as a peevish straw of nervous energy ... a self-involved chatterbox.\"\n\nAs NBC could have potentially retained intellectual property originating from O'Brien's entire 17-year tenure with the network, O'Brien simply changed names on the tour (turning his character, the Masturbating Bear, into the \"Self-Pleasuring Panda\"). \"The Washington Post\" later reported that retaining the characters was \"not a key issue for O'Brien\".\n\n\"Conan\" premiered in November 2010 to 4 million viewers, leading all late-night talk shows and more than tripling the audience of its direct competition, \"The Daily Show\" and \"The Colbert Report\" on Comedy Central. However, ratings quickly fell; by the following fall, \"The Wall Street Journal\" proclaimed that \"TBS's pricey Conan O'Brien experiment is flopping.\" In an effort to bolster ratings, TBS secured the cable syndication rights to \"The Big Bang Theory\" at a reported US$4 million per episode to serve as a lead-in to \"Conan\" three nights a week. Steve Koonin of Turner Entertainment stated in 2012 that \"Conan is our Mount Rushmore. We've made him the centerpiece of TBS. If success were only about ratings, we'd just run Westerns all the time.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" credited it with forging \"a digital empire, his company's own shows and a young audience TBS hopes will follow him anywhere.\" The show is currently renewed through 2022, which will bring O'Brien to his twenty-ninth year as a late night host. He is currently the longest-running active late night host, and among all late night hosts only Johnny Carson (thirty years) and David Letterman (thirty-three years) have had longer tenures.\n\nMany of the executives involved in the botched transition subsequently left NBC. Zucker was fired by Comcast Executive Vice President Steve Burke, but stressed that Comcast's insistence to install their own team was the reason. Marc Graboff opted to leave his contract early that November, as did Gaspin. While O'Brien admitted in 2012 that he occasionally still felt resentment over the events that transpired, he noted that \"I had an amazing partnership with NBC and was very disappointed at the outcome, but I didn't feel entitled to \"Late Night\" or \"Tonight\" or to the TBS show. If you're in this business and haven't experienced profound pain at some point, you're not doing it right. I strongly believe that.\" He has had no contact with Leno, noting \"the odds are we will both leave this Earth without speaking to each other, which is fine. There's really nothing to say. We both know the deal. He knows; I know. I'd rather just forget.\"\n\nIn a 2010 issue of \"TV Guide\", the timeslot conflict ranked #1 on a list of TV's biggest \"blunders\".\n\nA wax likeness of O'Brien that had been commissioned by NBC/Universal from Madame Tussauds and unveiled during a December 2009 episode of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" was quietly returned to the Madame Tussauds museum on Hollywood Boulevard; the figure had originally been intended to permanently reside in the \"NBC Universal Experience\" theme park attraction. A remote segment produced a few months into O'Brien's TBS show saw the host humorously reuniting with the wax statue.\n\nOn October 5, 2011, O'Brien returned to 30 Rockefeller Plaza for a surprise, scripted appearance on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" to ceremonially retrieve the Triumph the Insult Comic Dog puppet from the studio after NBC had finally granted him the rights to use the character on TBS's \"Conan\". During the two-and-a-half minute bit, O'Brien and Fallon joked about the controversy when Fallon said, \"You were [host of \"Late Night\"] for sixteen years. Then what happened?\" to which O'Brien laughed and said, \"Don't you worry about that. You're a young guy.\"\n\nWhen interviewed by Marc Maron in 2011, O'Brien remarked, \"I'm trying to avoid that thing where you get a story in your head that's very clean. I think there are too many people that come up with a very simple story where they're the hero, and they don't learn anything.\"\n\nDuring his 2012 appearance on \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", O'Brien made it clear that he held no animosity toward NBC, pointing out that the individual executives he clashed with had departed the network shortly after he did due to a regime change. Indeed, Conan has occasionally shown clips from his NBC shows on his current TBS program with NBC's permission, and the character of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog (owned by NBC) was eventually allowed to appear on the TBS show as well, with Triumph's performer Robert Smigel explaining that NBC only stands to gain by allowing him to give their property exposure.\n\nIn an interview on \"Piers Morgan Live\", also in 2012, O'Brien acknowledged that in retrospect the plan to architect a transition for \"The Tonight Show\" five years in advance was \"absurd,\" though he noted that he never anticipated Leno's ratings would fall in that interim, as the press had sometimes intimated, and he pointed out that all previous \"Tonight Show\" hosts had departed when they were on top in the ratings. He further remarked that he was happier in his current situation at TBS where he feels \"liberated\" and can do the material he wants without the baggage of upholding a legacy.\n\nIn 2013, O'Brien was the headline performer invited to give remarks at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and \"The Tonight Show\" controversy was humorously alluded to throughout the evening. During his own speech, President Obama quipped, \"I understand that when the Correspondents' Association was considering Conan for this gig, they were faced with that age-old dilemma: Do you offer it to him now, or wait for five years and then give it to Jimmy Fallon?\" O'Brien himself referenced the affair with a joke that complimented President Obama on job creation: \"Since [Obama] was first elected, the number of popes has doubled, and the number of \"Tonight Show\" hosts has tripled.\" The ceremony had also opened with a pre-recorded sketch that featured Kevin Spacey as his \"House of Cards\" character Frank Underwood, who at one point expresses sympathy toward O'Brien for \"that backstabbing Leno.\"\n\nLater that year, O'Brien was chosen to host \"Carson on TCM\", a series that re-aired classic interviews from \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\".\n\nIn 2014, Leno participated in a \"60 Minutes\" episode focused on the host's second and permanent departure from \"The Tonight Show\" desk. Leno expressed to Steve Kroft that he had been \"blindsided\" in 2004 when NBC executives asked him to relinquish \"The Tonight Show\" in five years' time, though he admitted that he had accepted the decision with no argument or inquiry. In spite of this and the public remarks Leno had made at the time blessing O'Brien's succession, both Leno and his wife Mavis characterized \"The Tonight Show\" as having been taken from the incumbent host, rather than being something that he had voluntarily surrendered. When Leno explained that he was more willing to step aside the second time due to the considerable talent of Fallon and because \"talented people will only wait so long before they get other opportunities,\" Kroft pointed out that Leno had said very similar things about O'Brien years before. \"Well, maybe I did, yeah,\" admitted Leno before joking, \"Well, we'll see what happens.\"\n\nDuring a 2015 interview with Howard Stern, O'Brien explained that he prefers to avoid talking about the \"craziness,\" stating that people in show business shouldn't complain, that \"no one cares\", and that he noticed addressing the topic even in joking response to an earnest question by a guest on his show invariably resulted in admonishments from the media to \"let it go.\" He claimed that even in hindsight he does not regret doing five more years of \"Late Night\" instead of moving to FOX, nor does he regret his incarnation of \"The Tonight Show.\"\n\nLeno kept \"The Tonight Show\" number one for the rest of his run, until he handed the franchise to Fallon in February 2014. Fallon's credibility with younger viewers and presence online was why NBC instituted the change, which was announced only three years following O'Brien's departure. During the show that aired the day of the announcement, Conan congratulated Fallon, stating, \"Jimmy is the perfect guy to do it, and he's gonna do a fantastic job.\" While alluding to (and joking about) the 2010 controversy many times over his last few weeks on the air, Leno did not directly acknowledge his nine-month absence from the franchise nor did he mention O'Brien when he delivered his thank-yous and goodbyes as he concluded his second tenure as host. During the February 6, 2014, episode of \"Conan\", however, which aired the same night as Leno's final \"Tonight Show\", O'Brien referenced Leno in his monologue by alluding to NBC's position as the American broadcaster of the 2014 Winter Olympics, saying:\n\nNBC has the Olympics. It's a big deal. NBC will finally get to show somebody who is okay with passing the torch. (pause for laughter and applause) I allowed myself one, but it was a good one.\n\nThough NBC had made a considerable effort to scrub any references to O'Brien's brief tenure as \"The Tonight Show\" host both on-air and online, with one former blogger for NBC Sports noting a corporate policy banning any mention of O'Brien, it was acknowledged by the network during the buildup to the 2014 transition from Leno to Fallon. A brief shot of O'Brien walking onto his \"Tonight\" set was displayed in an on-air promo chronicling the franchise's history, and Fallon referenced the conflict on his first \"Tonight Show\" episode, when he opened the show by joking:\n\nI'm Jimmy Fallon, and I'll be your host—for now. (pause for laughter) Of course, I wouldn't be here tonight if it weren't for the previous \"Tonight Show\" hosts, so I want to say thank you to Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.\n\nLess than a month removed from hosting \"Tonight\", Leno appeared on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" on February 26, 2014, as a surprise guest to deliver the news that the revived program had been renewed by CBS Television Distribution for a second season. This proved to be premature, however, as Hall's program was indeed canceled on May 30, 2014.\n\nComedian Bill Maher paid tribute to Leno when he was inducted into the TV Academy, an honor bestowed upon the host in 2014 when he stepped down from \"The Tonight Show\" a second time. A longtime friend of Leno, Maher complained that Leno was \"victimized\" by the press during the NBC fiasco.\n\nIn a 2015 interview Leno reiterated his stance that O'Brien's own performance led to his ouster from 11:35 and that he remained mystified by the suggestion that he should have refused the time slot when it was offered back to him, saying \"Why? Because Conan and I were good friends? No. At that point ... it's a business decision. I'm sure it could have been handled differently. But I think it was a matter of letting things take its course. If Conan's ratings would have been fine, it wouldn't have been an issue. It wouldn't have come up.\" In 2017, Leno again absolved himself, instead emphasizing that he kept \"The Tonight Show\" number one after his return. He addressed the longstanding claim that his contract was the more expensive one to break with equivocation: \"I mean, if I'm that smart, how did I lose the show in the first place?\"\n\nWhen he took over \"Tonight\", Fallon insisted that Leno is welcome to appear on the show anytime he wishes, saying \"whenever he wants, he's got a stage.\" Leno made his first appearance as a guest on November 7, 2014, although he had previously appeared in a produced \"House of Cards\" parody on August 12, 2014, in which he is revealed as the mystery man who pushes Fallon (as Frank Underwood) onto the tracks in front of a speeding subway train. Leno has subsequently appeared on \"Tonight\" several times in the years since.\n\nOn February 13, 2015, Robert Smigel appeared in character as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" to promote \"The Jack and Triumph Show\". During the interview, he joked about the conflict to a visibly nervous Fallon. \"Listen, we love NBC. NBC ... we kid, you know? NBC will always be the place where Jack and I got our start. And where they f**cked Conan.\"\n\nOn December 7, 2015, \"The Daily Show\" made reference to the controversy. When former host Jon Stewart made a guest appearance on the show, current host Trevor Noah jokingly remarked \"Are you here to take the show back? Oh, man, I heard about this in American TV. Are you taking the show back?\". Stewart replied, quietly, \"Trust me, a thousand times no\".\n\nOver time, as the controversy has become more distant, formal acknowledgement of O'Brien's lengthy career at NBC has become more common by the network. In 2017, mention was made of the host in NBC's 90th Anniversary Special, and a display for him (along with all other former \"Tonight Show\" hosts) appears in the ride queue of the \"Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon\" theme park attraction at Universal Studios Florida. A plaque on the O'Brien display reads:\n\nIn September 1993, Conan O'Brien made his television debut on \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" after working as a writer on such television comedy institutions as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons\". O'Brien's brand of irreverent humor proved to be a hit with the late night audience, including memorable sketches like \"If They Mated,\" \"In the Year 2000,\" and \"Triumph the Insult Comic Dog.\" In September 2004, on the 50th anniversary of \"The Tonight Show\", NBC announced that O'Brien would take over hosting duties from Jay Leno in 2009. While his time as host proved to be short-lived, O'Brien went on to launch a new late night talk show, \"Conan\", on TBS in November 2010. Conan O'Brien remains a true comedy innovator and, at almost 25 years on the air, has enjoyed one of the longest runs of any late night television host.\n\nIn conjunction with his 25th anniversary as a late-night host, it was announced that O'Brien, TBS and NBC had come to an arrangement that would allow the entirety of O'Brien’s late night archive (with the exception of musical performances, which posed insurmountable licensing issues), totaling over four thousand episodes, to become available in January 2019 via a state-of-the-art web site dubbed \"Conan 25\". The launch marks the first time O'Brien's NBC programs have been made legally available since \"The Tonight Show\" conflict.\n\n"}

The economic crisis became coupled with a political crisis in Brazil that resulted in the impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff and in widespread dissatisfaction with the political system.\n\nIn 2015, Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 3.9% due to a drop in salaries, restrictions on credit and a rise in the basic interest rate. In 2016, Brazil's GDP fell by 3.6% with reductions across all sectors of the economy. It was the first time since 1931 that the GDP had fallen in two consecutive years.\nIn 2017 first quarter the economy up 1.4% and the recession had finally ended.\nBefore the recession, Brazil's unemployment rate hovered around 6.8% for most of 2014 and had been generally increasing since February 2015, averaging 8.5% in 2015. The economy lost more than 1.5 million jobs throughout 2015, fueling public discontent against the political establishment and the political leadership of the Worker's Party and President Dilma Rousseff. The unemployment rate continued to rise throughout 2016 to finish the year at 12.0%, with 12.3 million people unemployed and an estimated 2.8 million private sector jobs cut over the preceding two years.\n\nBrazil is currently experiencing a fiscal crisis and an increasing budget deficit which, according to Bloomberg, has been \"the largest-ever primary budget gap ... as a two-year economic recession sapped tax collection while expenses grew further.\" The government deficit reached 5.8 billion reais (U$1.7 billion) in the first three months of 2016, the widest reported since December 2001. The two-year fiscal deterioration can be explained by the decrease in government revenue from taxes as a result of the recession, while expenses from government have been growing constantly.\n\nThis is a table of the credit ratings of the Brazilian economy according to Trading Economics.\nSince the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff and the subsequent rise of Michel Temer to power a variety of projects, many of which seen as unpopular, were proposed in order to get the economy back on track. In early 2017, there were already signals that the economy was beginning to recover, however, it was agreed that the process would be long and slow.\n\nIn June 2017, a 1% rise in GDP in the first quarter of the year was reported. It was the first rise of the GDP after eight consecutive falls (two years). Minister of Finance Henrique Meirelles said that the country had exited the \"greatest recession of the century\". However, economists say that the growth characterizes only the end of the \"technical recession\" and that it is still too early to claim that the crisis is over, given that unemployment remains high and there's still widespread uncertainty regarding the future of the economy, especially in the aftermath of the recent political scandals.\n\n"}

{"id": "33954057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33954057", "title": "23 Minutes Over Brussels", "text": "23 Minutes Over Brussels\n\n23 Minutes Over Brussels is a recording of a live performance by Suicide on June 16, 1978, at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels, Belgium, while supporting Elvis Costello and The Clash. The recording was first released as a promo in 1978, but remained largely unheard until its release in 1998 with the reissue of the band's self-titled debut album. The recording \"gives some indication of the public's reaction to this confrontational duo in their heyday\".\n\nA friend of the band, Howard Thompson, recorded the performance on cassette tape, and it was later released as a flexi-disc insert for a music magazine. In 2000, while Mute Records was rereleasing Suicide's catalog, the tape was remastered and included as a bonus track for their first album. The entire performance is mixed as a single track.\n\nBefore Suicide even starts playing, booing can be heard from the crowd indicating that they wanted to hear the main act, Elvis Costello, straight away. Suicide is introduced and begins to play \"Ghost Rider\". Once it ends, there is booing from the crowd. The second song is \"Rocket U.S.A\". After that, at roughly 9:30, the audience can be heard chanting \"ELVIS! ELVIS!\". This attitude continues through the third and fourth songs, \"Cheree\" and \"Dance\".\n\nThe audience becomes more active during the performance of \"Frankie Teardrop\". At roughly 19:30, loud applause can be heard; someone steals Alan Vega's microphone (a woman at 20:35 can be heard saying \"They took the mic\"). Shortly afterwards, the music stops and the promoter comes on, warning the audience that if they don't give the microphone back, there will be \"no show\". Vega joins in, swearing at the audience. After receiving the microphone, he continues to sing \"Frankie Teardrop\" a cappella. After even more booing, Vega shouts \"SHUT THE FUCK UP! THIS IS ABOUT FRANKIE!\". A few moments later, there is rapturous applause as the band leaves the stage.\n\nLater, Elvis Costello played a very short and angry set in which he made no secret of his outrage over Suicide's treatment by the crowd. This incited a riot. The show was cancelled and Vega's nose was broken. The story is detailed in the liner notes of the 2000 re-release.\n\nSuicide would only become famous after the peak of their activity was over. During the 1980s and 90s, they were responsible for influencing many bands and shaping genres such as industrial music, dance music and notably electroclash. This performance has been called \"a record of proof of an innovative band’s struggle with an unreceptive audience\" and has been compared to the audience's reactions to Dylan going electric. It also \"clearly demonstrates two individuals flying in the face of convention, screaming their guts out to be heard, and failing to make a poignant imprint on the listening audience\". Allmusic said that \"though the (reissues) extra tracks dilute the original album's impact somewhat, they're worthwhile supplements to one of the punk era's most startlingly unique works\". In review of their debut album for 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Chris Shade called it a \"riotous comedy\", and noted that \"(their) lack of rock 'n' roll accoutrements such as a drummer or guitarist often aroused violent reactions in their bewildered audiences\".\n"}
{"id": "30862640", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30862640", "title": "Acid throwing", "text": "Acid throwing\n\nAcid throwing, also called an acid attack, a vitriol attack or vitriolage, is a form of violent assault defined as the act of throwing acid or a similarly corrosive substance onto the body of another \"with the intention to disfigure, maim, torture, or\nkill\". Perpetrators of these attacks throw corrosive liquids at their victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones.\n\nThe most common types of acid used in these attacks are sulfuric and nitric acid. Hydrochloric acid is sometimes used, but is much less damaging. Aqueous solutions of strongly alkaline materials, such as caustic soda (sodium hydroxide), are used as well, particularly in areas where strong acids are controlled substances.\n\nThe long term consequences of these attacks may include blindness, as well as permanent scarring of the face and body, along with far-reaching social, psychological, and economic difficulties.\n\nToday, acid attacks are reported in many parts of the world, though more likely in developing countries. Since the 1990s, Bangladesh has been reporting the highest number of attacks and highest incidence rates for women, with 3,512 Bangladeshi people acid attacked between 1999 and 2013, and in Pakistan and India acid attacks are at an all-time high and increasing every year. Although acid attacks occur all over the world, this type of violence is most common in South Asia. The UK has one of the highest rates of acid attacks per capita in the world, according to Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI). In 2016 there were over 601 acid attacks in the UK based on ASTI figures. Over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past five years. From 2011 to 2016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance in London alone.\nThe intention of the attacker is often to humiliate rather than to kill the victim. In Britain such attacks, particularly those against men, are believed to be underreported, and as a result many of them do not show up in official statistics.\nSome of the most common motivations of perpetrators include:\n\nAcid attacks often occur as revenge against a woman who rejects a proposal of marriage or a sexual advance. Gender inequality and women's position in the society, in relation to men, plays a significant role in these types of attacks.\nAttacks against individuals based on their religious beliefs or social or political activities also occur. These attacks may be targeted against a specific individual, due to their activities, or may be perpetrated against random persons merely because they are part of a social group or community. In Europe, Konstantina Kouneva, currently a member of the European Parliament, had acid thrown on her in 2008, in what was described as \"the most severe assault on a trade unionist in Greece for 50 years.\" Female students have had acid thrown in their faces as a punishment for attending school. Acid attacks due to religious conflicts have been also reported. Both males and females have been victims of acid attacks for refusing to convert to another religion.\n\nConflicts regarding property issues, land disputes, and inheritance have also been reported as motivations of acid attacks. Acid attacks related to conflicts between criminal gangs occur in many places, including the UK, Greece, and Indonesia.\n\nAccording to researchers and activists, countries typically associated with acid assault include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, China, United Kingdom, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. However, acid attacks have been reported in countries around the world, including:\n\nAdditionally, anecdotal evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as South America, Central and North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. However, South Asian countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.\n\nPolice in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are afraid to come forward to report attacks, meaning the true scale of the problem may be unknown.\n\nAn accurate estimate of the gender ratio of victims and perpetrators is difficult to establish because many acid attacks are not reported or recorded by authorities. According to a 2010 study in \"The Lancet\", there are \"no reliable statistics\" on the prevalence of acid attacks in Pakistan.\n\nA 2007 literature review analyzed 24 studies in 13 countries over the past 40 years, covering 771 cases. According to the London-based charity Acid Survivors Trust International 60% of acid attacks are on women, and acid assaults are grossly under-estimated. In some regions, assaults perpetrated on female victims by males are often driven by the mentality \"If I can't have you, no one shall.\"\n\nIn Bangladesh, throwing acid has been labeled as a \"gender crime\", as there is a dominance of female victims who are assaulted by males, for the reason of refusing to marry, or refusing sexual advances from male perpetrators In Jamaica, women throwing acid on other women in relation to fights over male partners is a common cause. In the UK, the majority of victims are men, and many of these attacks are related to gang violence.\n\nAnother factor that puts victims at increased risk for an acid assault is their socioeconomic status, as those living in poverty are more likely to be attacked. , the three nations with the most noted incidence of acid attacks – Bangladesh, India, and Cambodia – were ranked 75th, 101st, and 104th, respectively, out of 136 countries on the Global Gender Gap Index, a scale that measures equality in opportunities between men and women in nations.\n\nThe UK has one of highest rates of acid attacks in the world, according to the police. An average of two attacks a day are recorded by forces across the country. 2017 was the worst year for acid attacks in London according to London Metropolitan Police showed a sharp rise in attacks, with 465 recorded in 2017, up from 395 the previous year and 255 in 2015. Mark van Dongen was the victim of an attack during the early hours of 23 September 2015.\n\nIn 2016, the Metropolitan Police in London recorded 454 attacks involving corrosive fluids in the city, with 261 in the previous year, indicating a rise of 36%. A rise of 30% was also recorded in the UK as a whole. Between 2005–06 and 2011–12 the number of assaults involving acid throwing and other corrosive substances tripled in England, official records show. NHS hospital figures record 144 assaults in 2011–12 involving corrosive substances, which can include petrol, bleach and kerosene. Six years earlier, 56 such episodes were noted. One British expert says she believes many of the cases involving acid are linked to communities of immigrants from Asia, with women attacked by their husbands or punished for refusing forced marriages. Muhammed Nawshad Kamal, 32, was left blind after an acid attack in Walthamstow by a moped thief on 4 November 2017.\nAcid attacks in London continued to rise in 2017. In July 2017, the BBC's George Mann reported that police statistics showed that: \"Assaults involving corrosive substances have more than doubled in England since 2012. The vast majority of cases were in London.\" According to \"Time\" magazine, motives included organized crime, revenge, and domestic violence. According to Newham police there is no trend of using acid in hate crimes. \n\nAccording to data from the \"London Metropolitan Police\", a demographic breakdown of known suspects in London attacks for the period (2002–2016) showed White Europeans comprising 32% of suspects, African Caribbeans 38% and Asian 6%. Victims for the same period were 45% White Europeans, 25% African Caribbeans and 19% Asian. Known suspects were overwhelmingly male, 77% of known suspects were male and just 2% of suspects female. Four out of five victims in 2016 were male in contrast to other countries where women are most frequently victimized by men.\n\nOn April 2017, a man named Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of Ferne McCann, threw acid inside a nightclub across terrified clubbers in east London forcing a mass evacuation of 600 partygoers flooding into the street. 14 people were injured in the attack. Collins was sentenced to 20 years for the attack. Another similar attack is the Beckton acid attack. Katie Piper was also attacked with acid by her ex-boyfriend and an accomplice.\n\nOn 3 October 2017, the UK government announced that sales of acids to under 18s would be banned.\n\nIn January 2018, CNN reported that acid attacks in London increased six-fold between 2012 and 2017 and that 71% of attackers and 72% of victims were male.\n\nVictor Riesel was a broadcast journalist, specializing in labor issues, who was attacked while leaving Lindy's restaurant in midtown Manhattan in the early morning of 5 April 1956. Riesel was left blind as a result. The attack was motivated by Riesel's reporting on the influence of organized crime on certain corrupt labor unions.\n\nIn 1959, American attorney Burt Pugach hired a man to throw lye in the face of his ex-girlfriend Linda Riss. Riss suffered blindness and permanent scarring. Pugach served 14 years in prison for the incident.\n\nGabrielle White, a 22-year-old single mother living in Detroit, was attacked on 26 August 2006 by a stranger. She was left with third and fourth degree burns on her face, throat, and arms, leaving her blind and without one ear. She also miscarried her unborn child. A 25-year-old nursing student at Merritt College was the victim of an acid attack.\n\nDrug cartels such as the Los Zetas are known to use acid on civilians. For example, In the 2011 San Fernando massacre, Los Zetas members took away children from their mothers, and shot the rest of the civilians in a bus. The women were taken to a warehouse where many other women were held captive. Inside a dark room, the women were reportedly raped and beaten. Screams of the women and of the children being put in acid were also heard.\n\nIn South Asia, acid attacks have been used as a form of revenge for refusal of sexual advances, proposals of marriage and demands for dowry. Scholars Taru Bahl and M.H. Syed say that land/property disputes are another leading cause.\n\nIn Bangladesh, such attacks are relatively common.\nBangladesh has the highest reported incidence of acid assault in the world. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in Bangladesh, the country has reported 3000 acid attack victims since 1999, peaking at 262 victims for the year of 2002. Rates have been steadily decreasing by 15% to 20% since 2002, with the amount of acid attack victims reported at 91 in Bangladesh as recently as 2011. Bangladesh acid attacks shows the most gendered discrimination, with one study citing a male to female victim ratio of 0.15:1 and another reporting that 82% of acid attack survivors in Bangladesh are women. Younger women were especially prone to attack, with a recent study reporting that 60% of acid assault survivors are between the ages of 10 and 19. According to Mridula Bandyopadhyay and Mahmuda Rahman Khan, it is a form of violence primarily targeted at women. They describe it as a relatively recent form of violence, with the earliest record in Bangladesh from 1983.\n\nAcid attacks are often referred to as a \"crime of passion\", fueled by jealousy and revenge. Actual cases though, show that they are usually the result of rage at a woman who rebuffs the advances of a male. For the country of Bangladesh, such passion is often rooted in marriage and relationships. One study showed that refusal of marriage proposals accounted for 55% of acid assaults, with abuse from a husband or other family member (18%), property disputes (11%) and refusal of sexual or romantic advances (2%) as other leading causes. Additionally, the use of acid attacks in dowry arguments has been reported in Bangladesh, with 15% of cases studied by the Acid Survivors Foundation citing dowry disputes as the motive. The chemical agents most commonly used to commit these attacks are hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid.\n\nAcid attacks in India, like Bangladesh, have a gendered aspect to them: analyses of news reports revealed at least 72% of reported attacks included at least one female victim. However, unlike Bangladesh, India's incidence rate of chemical assault has been increasing in the past decade, with a high 27 reported cases in 2010. Altogether, from January 2002 to October 2010, 153 cases of acid assault were reported in Indian print media while 174 judicial cases were reported for the year of 2000.\n\nThe motivation behind acid attacks in India mirrors those in Bangladesh: a study of Indian news reports from January 2002 to October 2010 uncovered that victims’ rejected sex or marriage proposals motivated attacks in 35% of the 110 news stories providing a motive for the attack. Notable cases of acid attacks are Sonali Mukherjee's case of 2003 and Laxmi Agarwal in 2005.\n\nDuring the 2002 riots in Gujarat, targeted violence against Muslim women and children documented by civil society groups reported \"mass rapes, live burials and burnings, acid attacks, impaling, and other brutal forms of torture that was deeply gendered, and linked violence against women with violence on their children – both born and unborn\". In the 2008 Kandhamal Riots, more than 100 Christians were gang-raped, disemboweled, burned alive and had acid thrown to their faces by Hindu extremists for refusing to convert. Parikhit Nayak, a Dalit Christian Protestant convert from Hinduism who was tortured to death in front of his wife, Kanak. He was burnt with acid, castrated and finally disemboweled. Acid attacks were also used in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, where people were dragged from their houses and had acid thrown to their faces.\n\nPolice in India are also known to use acid on individuals, particularly on their eyes, causing blindness to the victims. A well known such case is the Bhagalpur blindings, where police blinded 31 individuals under trial (or convicted criminals, according to some versions) by pouring acid into their eyes. The incident was widely discussed, debated and acutely criticized by several human rights organizations. The Bhagalpur blinding case had made criminal jurisprudence history by becoming the first in which the Indian Supreme Court ordered compensation for violation of basic human rights.\n\nAccording to \"New York Times\" reporter Nicholas D. Kristof, acid attacks are at an all-time high in Pakistan and increasing every year. The Pakistani attacks he describes are typically the work of husbands against their wives who have \"dishonored them.\" Statistics compiled by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) show that 46 acid attacks occurred in Pakistan during 2004 and decreased with only 33 acid assaults reported for 2007. According to a \"New York Times\" article, in 2011 there were 150 acid attacks in Pakistan, up from 65 in 2010. However, estimates by the Human Rights Watch and the HRCP cite the number of acid attack victims to be as high 400–750 per year. Motivation behind acid assaults range from marriage proposal rejections to religious fundamentalism.\n\nThe Mong Kok acid attacks were incidents in 2008, 2009, and 2010 where plastic bottles filled with corrosive liquid (drain cleaner) were thrown onto shoppers on Sai Yeung Choi Street South, Hong Kong, a pedestrian street and popular shopping area. A reward, originally HK$100,000, for information about the perpetrator or perpetrators, was raised to HK$300,000 following the second incident, and cameras were to be installed in the area following the December incident. The third incident occurred the very day the cameras were turned on. The fifth incident happened after Hong Kong government announced its new strategies against the incident. 130 people were injured in these attacks.\n\nRecent studies on acid attacks in Cambodia found the victims were almost equally likely to be men or women (48.4% men, 51.6% women). As with India, rates of acid attacks in Cambodia have generally increased in the past decades, with a high rate of 40 cases reported for 2000 that started the increasing trend. According to the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity, 216 acid attacks were reported from 1985 to 2009, with 236 reported victims. Jealousy and hate is the biggest motivator for acid attacks in Cambodia, as 28% of attacks reported those emotions as the cause. Such assaults were not only perpetrated by men—some reports suggest women attack other women occur more frequently than men do. Such incidents usually occur between a husband's wife and mistress to attain power and socioeconomic security.\n\nA particularly high-profile case of this nature was the attack on Cambodian teenager Tat Marina in 1999, allegedly carried out by the jealous wife of a government official (the incident prompted a rash of copycat crimes that year, raising the number from seven in 1998 to 40 in 1999). One third of the victims are bystanders. In Cambodia, there is only one support center that is aiming to help acid attack survivors. There they can receive medical and legal support.\n\nAcid attacks are common in Vietnam although not to the level of countries such as Pakistan and India. An example of an acid attack in Vietnam is the Ho Chi Minh City acid attack where four people were injured. Most of Vietnam's acid attack victims spend their lives isolated and ignored and also blamed for their agony.\n\nIran\n\nAccording to Afshin Molavi, in the early years of the revolution and following the mandating of the covering of hair by women in Iran, some women were threatened with acid attacks by Islamic vigilantes for failing to wear hijab.\n\nRecently, acid assault in Iran has been met with increased sanctions. The Sharia \"code of qisas\", or equivalence justice, required a caught perpetrator of acid violence to pay a fine and may be blinded with acid in both eyes. Under Iranian law, victims or their families can ask a court's permission to enact \"qisas\" either by taking the perpetrator's life in murder cases or afflicting an equal injury to his or her body. One victim, Ameneh Bahrami, sentenced her attacker to be blinded in 2008. However, as of July 31, 2011, she pardoned her attacker, thereby absolving Majid Movahedi of his crime and halting the retributive justice of Qisas.\n\nIn October 2014, a series of acid attacks on women occurred in the city of Isfahan, resulting in demonstrations and arrests of journalists who had covered the attacks. The attacks were thought by many Iranians to be the work of conservative Islamist vigilantes, but the Iranian government denies this.\n\nAfghanistan\n\nSuch attacks or threats against women who failed to wear hijab, dress \"modestly\" or otherwise threaten traditional norms have been reported in Afghanistan. In November 2008, extremists subjected girls to acid attacks for attending school.\n\nIsrael, West Bank and Gaza Strip\n\nIn 1983 acid attacks were reported to be carried out by Mujama al-Islamiya against men and woman who spoke out against the Mujama in the Islamic University of Gaza. Additional attacks by Mujama al-Islamiya were reported through 1986. During the First Intifada, Hamas and other Islamist factions conducted an organized intimidation of women to dress \"modestly\" or wear the hijab. Circulars were distributed specifying proper modest dress and behavior. Women who did not conform to these expectations, or to \"morality expectations\" of secular factions, were vulnerable to attacks which included pouring acid on their bodies, rock pelting, threats, and even rape. B'Tselem has also documented additional attacks with acid in specific attacks involving women in a collaboration context.\n\nIn 2006-7, as part of a wider campaign to enforce Islamist moral conduct, the al-Qaida affiliated \"Suyuf al-Haq\" (Swords of Righteousness) claimed to have thrown acid on the faces of \"immodestly\" dressed woman in Gaza as well as engaging in intimidation via threats. Following 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict Amnesty International has claimed that Hamas used acid during interrogations as a torture technique. Hamas denies this claim. In 2016, during a teacher's strike, unknown assailants hurled acid in the face of a striking Palestinian teacher in Hebron.\n\nThere have also been recorded incidents of acid use against Israelis. In December 2014, a Palestinian hurled acid (concentrated vinegar which contains a high percentage of acetic acid and can cause burns) into a car containing a Jewish family of six and a hitchhiker at a checkpoint between Beitar Illit and Husan in the West Bank, causing serious face injuries to the father and lightly injuring other occupants, including children. In September 2008 a Palestinian woman carried out two separate acid attacks against soldiers at Huwwara checkpoint, blinding one soldier.\n\nMoshe Hirsch was the leader of the anti-Zionist Neturei Karta group in Jerusalem. Hirsch had one glass eye due to an injury sustained when someone threw acid in his face. According to his cousin, journalist Abraham Rabinovich, the incident had no link with Hirsch's political activities but was connected to a real estate dispute.\n\nHigh incidence of acid assaults have been reported in some African countries, including Nigeria, Uganda, and South Africa. Unlike occurrences in South Asia, acid attacks in these countries show less gender discrimination. In Uganda, 57% of acid assault victims were female and 43% were male. A study focusing on chemical burns in Nigeria revealed a reversal in findings—60% of the acid attack patients were male while 40% were female. In both nations, younger individuals were more likely to suffer from an acid attack: the average age in the Nigeria study was 20.6 years, while Ugandan analysis shows 59% of survivors were 19–34 years of age.\n\nMotivation for acid assault in these African countries is similar to that of Cambodia. \"Relationship conflicts\" caused 35% of acid attacks in Uganda in 1985–2011, followed by property conflicts at 8%, and business conflicts at 5%. Disaggregated data was not available in the Nigeria study, but they reported that 71% of acid assaults resulted from an argument with either a jilted lover, family member, or business partner. As with the other nations, researchers believe these statistics to be under-representative of the actual scope and magnitude of acid attacks in African nations.\n\nIn August 2013, two Jewish women volunteer teachers—Katie Gee and Kirstie Trup from the UK—were injured by an acid attack by men on a moped near Stone Town in Tanzania.\n\nOn January 17, 2013, Russian ballet dancer Sergei Filin was attacked with acid by an unknown assailant, who cornered him outside of his home in Moscow. He suffered third-degree burns to his face and neck. While it was initially reported that he was in danger of losing his eyesight, his physicians stated on January 21, 2013 that he would retain eyesight in one eye.\n\nAn unidentified Russia woman allegedly attacked men on public transportation for \"manspreading\". Pictures exist of a woman pouring a clear substance on the crotch of men on public transportation, though the contents of the liquid are unknown, it was allegedly a mixture of water and bleach. It was later revealed that the \"attacks\" were staged by paid actors, in order to spread disinformation and stir anti-feminist sentiment. \n\nOn July 31, 2018, Kateryna Handziuk, an anti-corruption activist and political advisor from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, was attacked with sulfuric acid outside her home by an unknown attacker. She died of her injuries on November 3, 2018. She was 33 years old. \n\nColombia\nThough comprehensive statistics on acid attacks in South America are sparse, a recent study investigating acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, provides some insight for this region. According to the article, the first identified survivor of acid violence in Bogota was attacked 15 years ago. Since then reported cases have been increasing with time. The study also cited the Colombian Forensics Institute, which reported that 56 women complained of aggression by acid in 2010, 46 in 2011, and 16 during the first trimester of 2012. The average age of survivors was about 23 years old, but ranged from 13 to 41 years.\n\nThe study reported a male:female victim ratio of 1:30 for acid assault in Bogota, Colombia, although recent reports show the ratio is closer to 1:1. Reasons behind these attacks usually stemmed from poor interpersonal relationships and domestic intolerance toward women. Moreover, female victims usually came from low socioeconomic classes and had low education. The authors state that the prevalence of acid attacks in other areas of South America remains unknown due to significant underreporting.\n\nOn March 27, 2014, a woman named Natalia Ponce de León was assaulted by Jonathan Vega, who threw a liter of sulphuric acid on her face and body. Vega, a former neighbor, was reported to have been \"obsessed\" with Ponce de León and had been making death threats against her after she turned down his proposal for a relationship. 24% of her body was severely burned as a result of the attack. Ponce de León has undergone 15 reconstruction surgeries on her face and body since the attack.\n\nThree years before the attack took place, Colombia reported one of the highest rates of acid attacks per capita in the world. However, there was not an effective law in place until Ponce de León's campaign took off in the months after her attack. The new law, which is named after her, defines acid attacks as a specific crime and increases maximum sentences to 50 years in jail for convicted offenders. The law also aims to provide victims with better state medical care including reconstructive surgery and psychological therapy. Ponce de León expressed hope that the new law would act as a deterrent against future attacks.\n\nThe most notable effect of an acid attack is the lifelong bodily disfigurement. According to the Acid Survivors Foundation in Pakistan, there is a high survival rate amongst victims of acid attacks. Consequently, the victim is faced with physical challenges, which require long-term surgical treatment, as well as psychological challenges, which require in-depth intervention from psychologists and counselors at each stage of physical recovery. These far-reaching effects on their lives impact their psychological, social and economic viability in communities.\n\nThe medical effects of acid attacks are extensive. As a majority of acid attacks are aimed at the face, several articles thoroughly reviewed the medical implications for these victims. The severity of the damage depends on the concentration of the acid and the time before the acid is thoroughly washed off with water or neutralized with a neutralizing agent. The acid can rapidly eat away skin, the layer of fat beneath the skin, and in some cases even the underlying bone. Eyelids and lips may be completely destroyed and the nose and ears severely damaged. Though not exhaustive, Acid Survivors Foundation Uganda findings included:\n\nIn addition to these above-mentioned medical effects, acid attack victims face the possibility of septicemia, renal failure, skin depigmentation, and even death.\n\nA 2015 attack that involved throwing sulfuric acid on a man's face and body while he lay in bed caused him, among other serious injuries, to become paralyzed from the neck down.\n\nAcid assault survivors face many mental health issues upon recovery. One study showed that when compared to published Western norms for psychological well-being, non-Caucasian acid attack victims reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and scored higher on the Derriford appearance scale, which measures psychological distress due to one's concern for their appearance. Additionally, female victims reported lowered self-esteem according to the Rosenberg scale and increased self-consciousness, both in general and in the social sphere.\n\nIn addition to medical and psychological effects, many social implications exist for acid survivors, especially women. For example, such attacks usually leave victims handicapped in some way, rendering them dependent on either their spouse or family for everyday activities, such as eating and running errands. These dependencies are increased by the fact that many acid survivors are not able to find suitable work, due to impaired vision and physical handicap. This negatively impacts their economic viability, causing hardships on the families/spouses that care for them. As a result, divorce rates are high, with abandonment by husbands found in 25% of acid assault cases in Uganda (compared to only 3% of wives abandoning their disfigured husbands). Moreover, acid survivors who are single when attacked almost certainly become ostracized from society, effectively ruining marriage prospects. Some media outlets overwhelmingly avoid reporting acid attack violence, or the description of the attack is laconic or often implies that the act was inevitable or even justified.\n\nTreatment for burn victims remains inadequate in many developing nations where incidence is high. Medical underfunding has resulted in very few burn centers available for victims in countries such as Uganda, Bangladesh, and Cambodia. For example, Uganda has one specialized burn center in the entire nation, which opened in 2003; likewise, Cambodia has only one burn facility for victims, and scholars estimate that only 30% of the Bangladeshi community has access to health care.\n\nIn addition to inadequate medical capabilities, many acid assault victims fail to report to the police due to a lack of trust in the force, a sense of hopelessness due to the attackers' impunity, and a fear of male brutality in dealing with their cases. Most of the female victims suffer more because of police apathy in dealing with cases of harassment as safety issues as victims refused to register a police case despite being attacked thrice before meriting police aid after an acid attack.\n\nThese problems are exacerbated by a lack of knowledge of how to treat burns: many victims applied oil to the acid, rather than rinsing thoroughly and completely with water for 30 minutes or longer to neutralize the acid. Such home remedies only serve to increase the severity of damage, as they do not counteract the acidity.\n\nResearch has prompted many solutions to the increasing incidence of acid attacks in the world. Many countries look to Bangladesh, whose rates of attack have been decreasing, as a model, following their lead in many legislative reforms. However, several reports highlighted the need for an increased, legal role of NGOs to offer rehabilitation support to acid survivors. Additionally, nearly all research stressed the need for stricter regulation of acid sales to combat this social issue.\n\nMany non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been formed in the areas with the highest occurrence of acid attacks to combat such attacks. Bangladesh has its Acid Survivors Foundation, which offers acid victims legal, medical, counseling, and monetary assistance in rebuilding their lives. Similar institutions exist in Uganda, which has its own Acid Survivors Foundation, and in Cambodia which uses the help of Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity. NGOs provide rehabilitation services for survivors while acting as advocates for social reform, hoping to increase support and awareness for acid assault.\n\nIn Bangladesh, the Acid Survivors Foundation, Nairpokkho, Action Aid, and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee's Community Empowerment & Strengthening Local Institutions Programme assist survivors. The Depilex Smileagain Foundation and The Acid Survivors Foundation in Pakistan operates in Islamabad, offering medical, psychological and rehabilitation support. The Acid Survivors Foundation in Uganda operates in Kampala and provides counseling and rehabilitation treatment to victims, as well as their families. The LICADHO, the Association of the Blind in Cambodia, and the Cambodian Acid Survivors Charity assist survivors of acid attacks. The Acid Survivors Foundation India operates from different centres with national headquarters at Kolkata and chapters at Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nAcid Survivors Trust International (UK registered charity no. 1079290) provides specialist support to its sister organizations in Africa and Asia. Acid Survivors Trust International is the only international organisation whose sole purpose is to end acid violence. The organisation was founded in 2002 and now works with a network of six Acid Survivors Foundations in Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Uganda that it has helped to form. Acid Survivors Trust International has helped to provide medical expertise and training to partners, raised valuable funds to support survivors of acid attacks and helped change laws. A key role for ASTI is to raise awareness of acid violence to an international audience so that increased pressure can be applied to governments to introduce stricter controls on the sale and purchase of acid.\n\nIndian acid attack survivor Shirin Juwaley founded the Palash Foundation to help other survivors with psychosocial rehabilitation. She also spearheads research into social norms of beauty and speaks publicly as an advocate for the empowerment of all victims of disfigurement and discrimination. In 2011, the principal of an Indian college refused to have Juwaley speak at her school for fear that Juwaley's story of being attacked by her husband would make students \"become scared of marriage\".\n\nA positive correlation has been observed between acid attacks and ease of acid purchase. Sulfuric, nitric, and hydrochloric acid are most commonly used and are all cheap and readily available in many instances. For example, often acid throwers can purchase a liter of concentrated sulfuric acid at motorbike mechanic shops for about 40 U.S. cents. Nitric acid costs around $1.50 per liter and is available for purchase at gold or jewelry shops, as polishers generally use it to purify gold and metals. Hydrochloric acid is also used for polishing jewelry, as well as for making soy sauce, cosmetics, and traditional medicine/amphetamine drugs.\n\nDue to such ease of access, many organizations call for a stricter regulation on the acid economy. Specific actions include required licenses for all acid traders, a ban on concentrated acid in certain areas, and an enhanced system of monitoring for acid sales, such as the need to document all transactions involving acid. However, some scholars have warned that such stringent regulation may result in black market trading of acid, which law enforcements must keep in mind.\nAcid has been used in metallurgy and for etching since ancient times. The rhetorical and theatrical term \"La Vitrioleuse\" was coined in France after a \"wave of vitriolage\" occurred according to the popular press where, in 1879, 16 cases of vitriol attacks were widely reported as crimes of passion perpetrated predominantly by women against other women. Much was made of the idea that women, no matter how few, had employed such violent means to an end. On October 17, 1915, acid was fatally thrown on Prince Leopold Clement of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, heir to the House of Koháry, by his distraught mistress, Camilla Rybicka, who then killed herself. Sensationalizing such incidents made for lucrative newspaper sales.\n\nThe use of acid as a weapon began to rise in many developing nations, specifically those in South Asia. The first recorded acid attacks in South Asia occurred in Bangladesh in 1967, India in 1982, and Cambodia in 1993. Since then, research has witnessed an increase in the quantity and severity of acid attacks in the region. However, this can be traced to significant underreporting in the 1980s and 1990s, along with a general lack of research on this phenomenon during that period.\n\nResearch shows acid attacks increasing in many developing nations, with the exception of Bangladesh which has observed a decrease in incidence in the past few years.\n\nMany countries have begun pushing for legislation addressing acid attacks, and a few have recently employed new laws against this crime. Under the Qisas law of Pakistan, the perpetrator may suffer the same fate as the victim, and may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes. This law is not binding and is rarely enforced according to a \"New York Times\" report. In Pakistan, the Lower House of Parliament unanimously passed the Acid Control and Acid Crime Prevention Bill on May 10, 2011. As punishment, according to the bill individuals held responsible for acid attacks face harsh fines and life in prison. However, the country with the most specific, effective legislation against acid attacks is Bangladesh, and such legal action has resulted in a steady 20–30% decrease in acid violence for the past few years. In 2013, India introduced an amendment to the Indian Penal Code through the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, making acid attacks a specific offence with a punishment of imprisonment not less than 10 years and which can extend to life imprisonment and with fine.\n\nIndia's top court ruled that authorities must regulate the sale of acid. The Supreme Court's ruling on July 16, 2013, came after an incident in which four sisters suffered severe burns after being attacked with acid by two men on a motorbike. Acid which is designed to clean rusted tools is often used in the attacks can be bought across the counter. But the judges said the buyer of such acids should in future have to provide a photo identity card to any retailer when they make a purchase. The retailers must register the name and address of the buyer. In 2013, section 326 A of Indian Penal Code was enacted by the Indian Parliament to ensure enhanced punishment for acid throwing.\n\nIn 2002, Bangladesh introduced the death penalty for acid attacks and laws strictly controlling the sale, use, storage, and international trade of acids. The acids are used in traditional trades carving marble nameplates, conch bangles, goldsmiths, tanneries, and other industries, which have largely failed to comply with the legislation. Salma Ali of the Bangladesh National Women Lawyers' Association derided these laws as ineffective. The names of these laws are the Acid Crime Control Act (ACCA) and the Acid Control Act (ACA), respectively.\n\nThe ACCA directly impacts the criminal aspect of acid attacks, and allows for the death penalty or a level of punishment corresponding to the area of the body affected. If the attack results in a loss of hearing or sight or damages the victim's face, breasts, or sex organs then the perpetrator faces either the death penalty or life sentencing. If any other part of the body is maimed, then the criminal faces 7–14 years of imprisonment in addition to a fine of US$700. Additionally, throwing or attempting to throw acid without causing any physical or mental harm is punishable by this law and could result in a prison term of 3–7 years along with a US$700 fine. Furthermore, conspirators that aid in such attacks assume the same liability as those actually committing the crime.\n\nThe ACA regulates the sale, usage, and storing of acid in Bangladesh through the creation of the National Acid Control Council (NACC). The law requires that the NACC implement policies regarding the trade, misuse, and disposal of acid, while also undertaking initiatives that raise awareness about the dangers of acid and improve victim treatment and rehabilitation. The ACA calls for district-level committees responsible for enacting local measures that enforce and further regulate acid use in towns and cities.\n\nUnder the Qisas law of Pakistan, the perpetrator could suffer the same fate as the victim, if the victim or the victim's guardian chooses. It may be punished by having drops of acid placed in their eyes.\n\nSection 336B of Pakistan Penal Code states: \"Whoever causes hurt by corrosive substance shall be punished with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description which shall not be less than fourteen years and a minimum fine of one million rupees.\" Additionally, section 299 defines \"Qisas\" and states: \"\"Qisas\" means punishment by causing similar hurt at the same part of the body of the convict as he has caused to the victim or by causing his death if he has committed qatl-iamd (intentional manslaughter) in exercise of the right of the victim or a Wali (the guardian of the victim).\"\n\nAfter a spate of attacks in London in 2017, the Home Office said it would consider changes in laws and measures regarding sales of acid, as well as changes in prosecution and sentencing guidelines. As of 2017, it is unlawful to carry acid with the intent to cause harm. Attacks are prosecuted as acts of actual bodily harm and grievous bodily harm. Three quarters of police investigations do not end in prosecution, either because the attacker could not be found, or because the victim is unwilling to press charges. According to ASTI, of the 2,078 acid attack crimes recorded for the years 2011-2016 in UK, only 414 of those crimes resulted in charges being brought. Most acid attack crimes happened in London, where over 1,200 cases were recorded over the past five years. From 2011–2016 there were 1,464 crimes involving acid or corrosive substance. Northumbria recorded the second highest with 109 recorded attacks, Cambridgeshire had 69 attacks, Hertfordshire 67, Greater Manchester 57 and Humberside 52.\n\n\n\nVitriolage is the deliberate splashing of a person or object with acid, also known as vitriol, in order to deface or kill. A female who engages in such an act is known as a vitrioleuse. There are instances of this act throughout history and in modern times, often in places where honor killings are also common.\n\n\n\n"}

This is usually done through the state's Secretary of State's address or some other address which will legally substitute the agency's address for the victim's physical address on public records.\n\nAccording to the National Network to End Domestic Violence,\n\nAddress Confidentiality Programs (ACP) and Confidential Voter Listings are programs administered by the state enabling victims of domestic violence (and sometime victims of sexual assault and/or stalking) to participate in the voting process without fear of being found by their abusers. ACPs generally provide a substitute address for all public records. Confidential Voter Listings only provide confidentiality on election-related public records.\n\nThe rules implementing the Bank Secrecy Act require a financial institution to implement a Customer Identification Program that includes procedures that enable it to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of its customers.

She was the fourth woman from Venezuela to be named Miss Universe.\n\nDuring the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, Machado publicly criticized the prior behavior of Donald Trump who owned the Miss Universe pageant during her reign. She was mentioned by Hillary Clinton during the first 2016 U.S. presidential debate.\n\nMachado was born in Maracay, Venezuela. Her father was a toy store owner who emigrated from Spain and her mother's family emigrated from Cuba prior to the Cuban revolution. Machado took to performing at an early age. She began dancing at age 4 and acting at age 12. Machado attended college for a year and half but left to pursue modeling and appearing in commercials.\n\nMachado won the 1995 Miss Maracay pageant, and then the 1995 Miss Venezuela pageant representing Yaracuy state and then the Miss Universe 1996 crown in Las Vegas. Early in her training, she refused plastic surgery recommended to her, notable in Venezuelan beauty pageant culture. The runner-up, Jacqueline Aguilera, also won the Miss World 1995 crown, marking the second time that two Venezuelans from the same pageant won two world titles. Machado's reign came as American businessman Donald Trump took ownership of the Miss Universe pageant. While preparing for Miss Universe, Machado underwent intense dieting. Machado said that, when she won, she weighed 116 pounds and was anorexic and bulimic.\n\nDuring her reign as Miss Universe, Machado gained what she said was about 12 pounds in weight, drawing considerable press attention. The President of Miss Universe Organization denied that the organization was considering replacing her with runner-up, Taryn Mansell of Aruba. After mounting pressure to lose weight from Trump and other pageant officials, Machado asked Trump to assist her with orienting toward a healthier lifestyle. Trump arranged for 80 reporters to \"watch [her] sweat\" in a gym, which Machado later called \"in very bad taste\".\n\nIn 1998 Machado had her first starring telenovela role as the title character in Samantha. In 2001, she had a small role on the international soap opera \"Secreto de Amor\". During 2004–2005, she pursued a career as a TV commercial model with particular success in promoting a dieting product. In 2005, Machado appeared on a Spanish reality show called \"La Granja de los famosos\" (\"The Farm\"). On February 19, 2006, Machado debuted on the Mexican reality show \"Cantando Por Un Sueño\" (\"Singing For A Dream\").\n\nMachado appeared in (and on the cover of) the February 2006 issue of \"Playboy\" magazine's Mexican edition, becoming the only Miss Universe to pose nude for that magazine. Machado was cast in the comedic soap opera \"Una familia con suerte\" where she played a woman who fell in love with her brother's enemy. The show began airing in Mexico in February 2011 and in the United States in October of that same year. She again posed nude for the July 2010 issue of the Mexican edition of \"Playboy\".\n\nOn September 9, 2012, Machado was one of ten competitors on the third season of \"Mira Quien Baila\". On November 18, 2012, Alicia won 3rd place in the 3rd season of Univision's dance competition Mira Quien Baila. In 2013, Machado starred as the protagonist of \"La Madame\", a television serial produced by RTI Productions and RCN TV in Colombia. In February 2014, she joined Univision's beauty pageant Nuestra Belleza Latina 2014 as a mentor where she coach the participants on how to succeed in the modeling and television industry.\n\nIn 2017, she posed nude for PETA's \"I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur,\" ad campaign.\n\nIn 1998 Machado publicly supported the presidential campaign of Henrique Salas Römer. In 2010 she criticized populist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez in an interview with \"Playboy\".\n\nIn July 2015, after Donald Trump launched his presidential campaign, Machado announced that she would publish a book detailing what she called his \"abuses of power\" and \"racism\". She said that, during her year as Miss Universe, Trump called her \"Miss Piggy\" because she gained weight and \"Miss Housekeeping\" because of her Hispanic background. Trump's spokeswoman denied that Trump had made those insults. Machado has repeatedly called Trump a \"nazi rat\", compared him to Hugo Chavez and Adolf Hitler, and said that he was capable of starting a new Holocaust.\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Hillary Clinton brought up Machado's statements against Trump during the first presidential debate. The following day, Trump responded on \"Fox and Friends\", describing Machado as \"impossible\" and saying that \"she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem. We had a real problem. Not only that, her attitude, and we had a real problem with her.\" Later that week, Trump made a series of tweets in which he called her \"disgusting,\" condemned Clinton's judgement for not \"checking her past\", falsely claimed she had appeared in a \"sex tape\", and baselessly accused Clinton of using her influence to help Machado become an American citizen.\n\nThe tweets were condemned in editorials in \"The Los Angeles Times\" and \"The Globe and Mail\". John Cassidy of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Trump's \"original comments about Machado reeked of sexism and racism\" while his subsequent series of tweets \"highlighted, anew, his impulsiveness and lack of discipline.\" The following day, Clinton telephoned Machado to thank her for her support.\n\nBeginning in June 2016, Machado publicly campaigned in support of Hillary Clinton. The Clinton campaign coordinated many of her media appearances, featured her in two online advertisements, and used her to introduce Clinton at a campaign rally.\n\nIn 1998, a Venezuelan judge accused Machado of threatening to kill him while he was presiding over a case against her then-boyfriend for attempted murder. Machado was also accused of driving the boyfriend's getaway car. Machado denied both accusations and was never charged with a crime. The controversy caused a media sensation in Venezuela unseen since the conviction of President Carlos Andres Perez.\n\nMachado once dated professional baseball player Bobby Abreu; the couple later split, calling off their engagement.\n\nMachado has one daughter. In 2013, after being diagnosed with breast cancer, Machado underwent a double mastectomy.\n\nIn 2010, responding to being mocked on Twitter after mistakenly referring to North and South Korea as China, Machado closed her Twitter account and wrote, \"I now have a lot of psychopaths on the account and it's best I start another one, kisses.\"\n\nIn May 2016, Machado became a U.S. citizen.\n\nMachado both wrote and produced her debut album, unusual in the genre.\n\n"}

{"id": "14031818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14031818", "title": "Beargarden", "text": "Beargarden\n\nThe Beargarden or Bear Pit was the facility for bear-baiting, bull-baiting, and other \"animal sports\" in the London area during the 16th and 17th centuries, from the Elizabethan era to the English Restoration period. Samuel Pepys visited the venue in 1666 and described it as \"a rude and nasty pleasure\". The last recorded event at the Beargarden was the baiting of \"a fine but vicious horse\" in 1682.\n\nThe Beargarden was a round or polygonal open structure, comparable to the public theatres built in and around London starting in 1576. Contemporaneous illustrated maps of the city show a substantial three-storey building that resembles the theatres nearby. It was located in the Bankside, across from the City of London on the south bank of the River Thames in Southwark; but its exact location is unclear, and apparently changed over time. Documentary sources from the middle 16th century refer to the bear-baiting rink as being in Paris Garden, the liberty at the western end of the Bankside. The names of the facility and its location were merged in popular usage: John Stow, writing in 1583, calls it \"The Beare-garden, commonly called the Paris garden.\" Late-16th-century sources, however — the \"Speculum Britanniae\" map of 1593, and the \"Civitas Londini\" map of 1600 — show the Beargarden farther to the east, in the liberty of the Clink, where it sits on the northwestern side of the Rose Theatre. The building could have been moved from its original location, much as The Theatre was moved and rebuilt into the Globe Theatre in 1598–99.\n\nThe date of the Beargarden's construction is unknown; it was in existence by the 1560s, when it is shown on the \"woodcut\" map of the city. Questions of the Beargarden's location and date are complicated by the fact that animal sports were conducted at more than one place in Southwark in this era; the Agas map shows both a bull-baiting and a bear-baiting ring, situated near each other (bulls to the west, bears to the east). John Taylor the Water Poet, testifying in the Court of Exchequer in 1620 or 1621, said that \"the game of bear-baiting hath been kept in four several [i.e. separate] places, at Mason Stairs on the Bankside, near Maid Lane by the corner of Pike Garden, at the beargarden which was parcel of the possession of William Payne, and at the place where they now are kept.\"\n\nYet one main bear-baiting facility, the \"Paris Garden,\" stood out in the public mind. In 1578, William Fleetwood, \"Sergeant-in-law\" and Recorder of London, described it as a place where foreign ambassadors met their spies and agents; at night it was so dark and obscured by trees that a man needed \"cat's eyes\" to see. Ambassadors and travellers were often shown the Beargarden; The prominent French nobleman the Duke of Biron was escorted there by Sir Walter Raleigh on September 7, 1601.\n\nOn Sunday, January 13, 1583, eight people were killed and others injured when the scaffold seating in the Beargarden collapsed under their weight. Puritan commentators, hostile to animal baiting as they were to other sports and pastimes (like play-going), attributed the accident to God's displeasure. The Beargarden closed for a time, but reopened a few months later.\n\nThe English monarchy had had an official \"bearward,\" an officer in charge of its \"bears, bulls, and mastiff dogs,\" at least from the reign of Richard III. In 1573 a Ralph Bowes was appointed Queen Elizabeth's \"Master of Her Majesty's Game at Paris Garden.\" ( Elizabeth herself, like other royals and aristocrats of her era, was a passionate fan of animal baiting.) In 1604, Philip Henslowe (who had a financial interest in bear-baiting at least from 1594) and his son-in-law Edward Alleyn purchased the royal office of the Mastership for £450, and maintained the practice of animal baiting along with their other business of theatre production. Henslowe bought out Alleyn's share in 1611, for £580 (though Alleyn re-acquired his share upon Henslowe's 1616 death). In 1613, Henslowe and new partner Jacob Meade tore down the Beargarden, and in 1614 replaced it with the Hope Theatre. The Hope was equipped as a dual-purpose venue, hosting both stage plays and animal sports. Gradually, though, fewer plays were staged there, and the Hope was generally called the Beargarden after its primary use. Samuel Pepys, in an entry in his famous Diary, describes a visit he and his wife paid to the Hope/Beargarden on August 14, 1666. (He called the spectacle \"a rude and nasty pleasure.\")\n\nSurviving descriptions of the entertainment offered at the Beargarden have an extraordinary ring to a modern ear and sensibility. The crowds were amused at the whipping of the old blind bear \"Harry Hunks\" until the blood ran down his shoulders. (At least some bears — perhaps the fiercest, longest-enduring ones — were given names: \"George Stone,\" \"Ned Whiting,\" and the most famous, \"Sackerson.\") There are extant descriptions of horses with apes tied to their backs set upon by dogs. An early account, from the visiting Duke of Najera in 1544, mentions\n\nPepys describes a bull tossing a dog into a spectators' box. Others mention the bulls tossing dogs into the air and then catching the falling dogs on their horns again. On a few rare occasions (in 1604 and 1605, and in 1609 and 1610), lions were baited.\n\nThe shows at the Beargarden had surprising aspects; according to contemporary accounts, music and fireworks were used, and special effects were employed. German tourist Lupold von Wedel was at the Beargarden on August 23, 1584; he left a description that cites the usual and expected baiting of bulls and bears, and a horse chased by the dogs, plus people dancing, and a man who threw white bread to the crowd (they \"scrambled for it\"). And then,\n\nThe last recorded instance of animal baiting at the Hope/Beargarden occurred on April 12, 1682, when \"a fine but vicious horse was advertised to be baited to death for the amusement of the Moroccan ambassador...and for as many as would pay to see it.\" The horse reportedly had killed several men and other horses. It survived and beat off the dogs; to please the clamoring crowd, the horse was stabbed to death with a sword.\n\nNowadays, by contrast, the term \"Bear Garden\" is employed by a retailer of teddy bears and stuffed animals. However, the Bear Pit is not entirely forgotten: Alleyn bought the manor of Dulwich in 1605 and in the course of establishing his tenure, implemented a requirement of Sir Francis Bacon's Star Chamber to establish a charitable school \"for 12 poor children of the parish of Camberwell\" - who appear in practice to have often been the players of the female parts at the Globe. Their own sub-company, named the Bear Pit, continued in the original School, which passed through the Dulwich College Lower School in the 1850s to Alleyn's School in 1887, and remains active to this day, run without any parental or scholastic support, regularly producing household names in the theatre. The intention of theatre as a medium for the young was further promoted by the secondment of the School's Head of English, Michael Croft, in the late 1950s to establish the National Youth Theatre. Although many members were from the School, their outreach achieved the target of opening the theatre to many of less advantaged backgrounds, and a worldwide movement resulted.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42378988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42378988", "title": "Bunga Dyah Jatra", "text": "Bunga Dyah Jatra\n\nBuṅga Dyaḥ Jātrā () is a chariot procession honoring the Buddhist deity of compassion Avalokiteśvara held in Lalitpur, Nepal. It is one of the greatest religious events in the city and the longest chariot festival celebrated in the country. \n\nBuṅga Dyaḥ is also known as \"Raktalokitesvara Karunamaya\" and Rāto Machhindranāth and is revered as the giver of rain. The name Rato Machhendranath means Red Machhendranath in a reference to the color of the deity's image. The chariot festival is held according to the lunar calendar, so the date is changeable. It begins on the 4th day of the bright fortnight of Bachhalā, the seventh month in the lunar Nepal Sambat calendar.\n\nThe chariot procession was instituted to celebrate the arrival of Bunga Dyah in Nepal and the end of a devastating drought. It was started when Narendra Deva was the king (640-683 AD). \n\nPreparations for the festival begin with the construction of a 60-foot tall chariot at Pulchok at the western end of Lalitpur. When the chariot is complete, the image of Bunga Dyah from his temple is installed in it. Revellers then drag the chariot through the streets of Lalitpur on a tour that lasts a month. The chariot of Bunga Dyah is accompanied on the journey by a similar but smaller chariot of Chākuwā Dyah (चाकुवा द्यः). The deity is another Bodhisattva and is also known as Minnāth. \n\nThe route of the chariot procession starts at Pulchok and passes through Gabahal, Mangal Bazar, Hakha, Sundhara, Chakrabahil, Lagankhel and ends at Jawalakhel. As per time-honored tradition, the chariot is pulled exclusively by women on the stretch between the localities of Iti and Thati. This part of the chariot procession is known as Yākah Misāyā Bhujyā (याकः मिसाया भुज्या).\n\nThe parade finishes at the open ground of Jawalakhel which is situated at the western side of Lalitpur. There, the festivities conclude with the ceremony of Bhoto Jatra, the display of the bhoto, a traditional Nepalese vest.\n\nDuring the \"Barha Barsa Jatra\", that happens once in every 12 years, the chariot of the Machhindranath is constructed at Bungamati. The chariot is pulled all the way from Bungamati through Bhaisepati, Nakkhu, Bhanimandal, Jhamsikhel and to Pulchowk. The chariot is pulled from Jhamsikhel (near Ideal Model School) to Pulchowk at night. Then the chariot is pulled through the town at its normal route. After the Bhoto Jatra ceremony at Jawalakhel, the idol of Rato Machhindranath is taken back to Bungamati, where it spends the 6 months of the year.\n\nBhoto Jatra, which literally means \"vest festival\", is the climax of the chariot procession of Bunga Dyah Jatra. After the two chariots arrive in Jawalakhel, astrologers choose an auspicious date to hold the Bhoto Jatra festival. On the appointed day in the presence of the head of state, a government official climbs on to the chariot and holds up a jewel-studded black vest from the four sides of the chariot so that all the people gathered around can have a look at it. \n\nThe display is a re-enactment of an event that happened eons ago. According to legend, a Jyapu (Newar farmer) lost the vest which he had received as a gift from the serpent god Karkotaka Naga for doing him a favour. One day, the farmer had come to Jawalakhel to watch the chariot pulling festival where he saw someone wearing his missing garment. \n\nA quarrel developed over the vest, and since neither party could prove ownership, it was agreed that the undershirt would be kept with Bunga Dyah until the rightful owner comes to claim it with adequate proof. Since then, the vest has been shown to the public annually as a call to potential claimants to step forward. \n\nThe living goddess Kumari of Patan also arrives in Jawalakhel to observe Bhoto Jatra. She watches the ceremony from a special rest house. The auspicious day when the Bhoto Jatra is held is determined by astrologers, so the date is changeable. In 2014, the vest showing will be held on 22 June.\n\nAfter the festival, the chariot is dismantled and the parts are stored until it is time for the procession the next year. Rato Machhendranath is taken to a temple in the nearby village of Bungamati, also known as the second home of the rain god. The deity spends the next six months in that temple.\n"}

The first \"Symphony of Fire\" was held from July 25 to August 5, 1990. The celebration is one of Vancouver's largest and most well known festivals, and is recognized as the longest running off-shore fireworks competitions in the world. The multiple-day event has an estimated annual attendance of 1.4 million people.\nThe 2018 Honda Celebration of Light will take place on July 28, August 1, and August 4. The participating countries will be South Africa, represented by Fireworks for Africa; Sweden, represented by Unique Pyrotechnic; and South Korea, by Daehan Fireworks Co. For the first time, all three competitors are required to incorporate the same theme into their fireworks display and musical accompaniment. The theme, which was voted by the public, will be love.\n\nThe 2017 Honda Celebration of Light took on place July 29, August 2, and August 5, featuring competitors from Japan, the United Kingdom, and Canada. The competitor for Japan, Akariya, previously won the 2014 Honda Celebration of Light. Widely regarded as the premiere pyrotechnic company in the UK, the multi-award winning Jubilee Fireworks Ltd became the holders of the first \"Champions of Champions\" title after winning both national competitions: The British Fireworks Championships and The British Musical Fireworks Championships. Royal Pyrotechnie, recognized as the most decorated fireworks firm in Canada, is the only group to win three Gold Jupiter awards during the annual L'International des Feux Loto-Québec competition.\n\nTo celebrate Canada's 150th anniversary, each of the competitors were required to include one iconic Canadian song into their display, extending the traditional length of the shows (25 minutes) for an additional 3 minutes (for a total of 28 minutes). The songs were voted by the public on Honda's Celebration of Light Facebook page; the three chosen were \"Ahead by a Century\" by The Tragically Hip, \"Hallelujah\" by Leonard Cohen, and \"Summer of '69\" by Bryan Adams. The winner of the competition was Japan.\n\nThe 2016 Honda Celebration of Light took place on July 23, July 27, and July 30. The event featured the Netherlands, Australia, and the United States in competition. Notably, 2016 was the first time that the Netherlands has competed in the event. The Walt Disney Company, the world's largest consumer of fireworks, was the competitor for the United States, while Australia was represented by Howard & Sons, whose displays have included the opening and closing ceremonies for 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and opening and closing ceremonies for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi and 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Team USA won the competition. Vancouver Police had to shut down English Bay Beach for the Team USA show, due to capacity concerns.\n\nThe 2015 Honda Celebration of Light was scheduled for July 25, July 29, and August 1. For the 25th anniversary of the event, three returning competitors from China, Brazil, and Canada participated. The 2015 competition winner was Canada.\n\nThe 2014 Honda Celebration of Light was scheduled for July 26, July 30, and August 2, featuring performances by the United States, France, and Japan respectively. The competitors were newcomers to Vancouver, though their respective countries have previously participated before. The 2014 competition winner was Japan.\n\nThe 2013 Honda Celebration of Light was scheduled for July 27, July 31, and August 3, with performances by the United Kingdom, Canada, and Thailand respectively. 2013 was the first year that Thailand participated in the event as part of the organizers' ongoing efforts to introduce a new nation to the program each year. The 2013 competition winner was Canada.\n\nThe 2012 Honda Celebration of Light was saw teams from Vietnam and Brazil as newcomers, while the Italian team of Pirotecnica Soldi was more established. Canada did not participate for the first time in six years as producers of the event had been looking for new countries to compete from each continent for the next three years. The 2012 competition winner was Italy.\n\nThe 2011 HSBC Celebration of Light presented a \"Battle of Champions\" by featuring three previous competition winners: China (represented by 2009 winner Red Eagle Industrial and Trade Co. Ltd), Spain (represented by 2010 winner Pirotecnia Igual), and Canada (represented by 2007 and 2008 winner Archangel Fireworks Inc). The winner for the 2011 competition was China.\n\nThe 2010 HSBC Celebration of Light winner was Spain (Pirotecnia Igual).\n\nThe 2009 HSBC Celebration of Light winner was China (Red Eagle Industrial and Trade Co. Ltd.).\n\nThe 2008 HSBC Celebration of Light winner was Canada, making back-to-back wins for Archangel Fireworks Inc.\n\nThe 2007 HSBC Celebration of Light winner was Canada.\n\nThe 2006 winner was Mexico, who joined the competition for the first time.\n\nBecause of the change in sponsor, records are difficult to find before the year 2001.\n\n\n"}

He served in Austria, Germany, Korea, Vietnam, the United Kingdom, Iran, and Turkey, before his final assignment as commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe in 1977. After his retirement in 1978, he was a defense consultant for more than 20 years, retiring in 1998.\n\nDevol Brett was born in California in 1923 at the Presidio of San Francisco, the son of U.S. Army Air Force General George Brett. He attended private high school, at Landon School in Bethesda, Maryland, graduating in 1941.\nIn 1945 he graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., where he was given the nickname \"Rock\" for his toughness.\n\nIn 1966 he earned a master's degree in international policy from George Washington University.\n\nUpon graduation, Brett was commissioned a pilot in the Army Air Corps. He first assignment after training, in 1946, was in Horsching, Austria; in 1947 he was assigned to the 86th Fighter Wing at Munich, Germany. In the early days of the Berlin Airlift in 1948, he flew C-47 cargo planes.\n\nDuring the Korean War, Brett flew more than 100 combat missions, piloting P-51D Mustangs out of the 18th Fighter Wing. He sometimes led as many as 36 planes on a mission, each typically carrying two 500 pound bombs, six rockets, plus machine gun ammunition. His plane had the nickname \"Noherohere\" painted on it; his wife has asked him to \"be good, but don't be a hero\".\n\nBeginning in April 1957, Brett commanded the 355th Fighter Day Squadron, out of Myrtle Beach Air Force Base, which consisted of 17 F-100 Super Sabre jets. In that position, he was featured in a 1958 Time magazine article in which an editor went weightless during dozens of short climbs and dives in Brett's F100. His unit made four major deployments to Europe, including the 1958 Lebanon crisis, where his squadron was part of the first Composite Air Strike Force, and the Berlin Crisis of 1961. In 2003 he was honored by The Air Command and Staff College Gathering of Eagles Foundation, which designated him an \"Eagle\"; the Foundation specifically noted his actions in the Lebanon Crisis: On 14 July 1958, Rock Brett led his F-100D/F squadron in Operation DOUBLE TROUBLE, a top secret mission to deploy the first full Composite Air Strike Force from the US to Turkey in support of Lebanon invoking the Eisenhower Doctrine following the 14 July coup d'etat in Iraq. This mission was also the first operational day/night transatlantic air-refueling mission by fighters. Brett's squadron was in place in less than 20 hours after notification. His leadership helped resolve the crisis and pave the way for today's critical Air Expeditionary Force deployments.\n\nIn the Vietnam War, Brett flew more than 100 missions in a F-4C jet fighter. In 1967, he was shot down over North Vietnam by anti-aircraft fire. He broke his nose and cheekbone while ejecting from his aircraft, and was picked up by a search and rescue helicopter team after several hours in the water. The other member of his crew, a radar operator, did not survive.\n\nFrom 1973 to 1975, Brett was the senior U.S. military officer in Iran, as chief of the U.S. Military Mission with the Iranian armed forces and the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) to that country. He was followed in that position by Major General Richard Secord.\n\nIn 1978, Brett retired from the Air Force. His final position, which he had assumed in 1977, was as commander of Allied Air Forces Southern Europe, headquartered in Naples, Italy (part of Allied Forces Southern Europe) and (jointly) commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe's Sixteenth Air Force, based at Torrejon Air Base, Spain.\n\nAfter retiring from the Air Force, Brett became a private military consultant for the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). He specialized in conventional and nuclear tactical systems with emphasis on the employment of air power. While at IDA, he also did studies on search and rescue and personnel recovery for the Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office. Among his work was a joint report in 1985, with retired General Bryce Poe, for the Federal Construction Council, on quality control of Air Force construction programs.\n\nHe retired in 2009.\n\nIn 1947, Brett married Hermine Mayerl of Austria. Brett, stationed in Germany, announced the birth of their first son by flying his P-47 over the village where his in-laws lived, a short flight from his air base, and dropping a canister with the message \"It's a boy - George Howard Brett II.\" The couple had a second child, Karla.\n\nHermine, who went by Mimi, died in 1999. In 2005, Brett married Lou Longino, the widow of a long-time friend of his.\n\n"}
{"id": "48640148", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48640148", "title": "Effects of genocide on youth", "text": "Effects of genocide on youth\n\nThe effects of genocide on youth include psychological and demographic effects that affect the transition into adulthood. These effects are also seen in future generations of youth.\n\nDemographic effects involve the transfer of children during genocides. In cases of transfer, children are moved or displaced from their homes into boarding schools, adoptive families, or to new countries with or without their families. There are significant shifts in populations in the countries that experience these genocides. Often, children are then stripped of their cultural identity and assimilated into the culture that they have been placed into.\n\nUnresolved trauma of genocide affects future generations of youth. Intergenerational effects help explain the background of these children and analyze how these experiences shape their futures. Effects include the atmosphere of the household they grew up in, pressures to succeed or act in specific ways, and how they view the world in which they live.\n\nThe passing down of narratives and stories are what form present day perceptions of the past. Narratives are what form future generations' ideas of the people who were either victimized or carried out the genocide. As youth of future generations process the stories they hear they create their own perception of it and begin to identify with a specific group in the story. Youth of future generations begin to form their identity through the narratives they hear as they begin to relate to it and see how the genocide affects them. As stories are passed down, children also begin to understand what their parents or grandparents went through. They use narratives as explanation of why their parents talk about it in the way they do or do not talk about it all.\n\nPsychological effects of genocide are also relevant in youth. Youth who experience an extreme trauma at an early age are often incapable of fully understanding the event that took place. As this generation of children transition into adulthood, they sort out the event and recognize the psychological effects of the genocide. It is typical for these young survivors to experience symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as other psychological disorders.\n\nTransitioning out of youth and into adulthood is an important development marker in the lives of all people. Youth who transition into adulthood during a genocide have a different experience than those who do not transition during a genocide. Some youth transition earlier as means of survival. Others are unable to fully transition, remaining in a youth state longer.\n\nNative Americans in the United States were subject to military and land-taking campaigns by U.S. government policies. Disease reduced 95 percent the American Indian population between 1492 and 1900, the worst demographic collapse in human history. There were also frequent violent conflicts between Indians and settlers. Scholarly debates have not resolved whether specific conflicts during US military expansion can be defined as genocide because of questions over the intent. Specific conflicts such as the Sand Creek massacre, the 1851 California Round Valley Wars, and Shoshoni massacres in the 1860s in Idaho have been described as genocidal or genocide. Cultural genocide included the intent to destroy cultural systems like collective land ownership and preventing children from learning the Native culture.\n\nYouth and children were included among non-combatants killed by military forces, vigilantes, or disease during US colonization. Cases of girls being raped and children being cut into pieces were documented in the states of Arizona, Ohio, and Wyoming in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Children were taken prisoner after battles between whites and Native Americans.\n\nYouth were a primary target for many state projects. From 1824 until the 1970s, approximately 100 boarding schools were operated by the United States federal government. Native families volunteered and were forced to send their children to attend Indian Boarding Schools. it has been claimed that this state intention was to keep youth from learning indigenous culture: one boarding school founder described boarding schools as a way to \"Kill the Indian, Save the Man.\" Children at these sites experienced physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. However, oral histories also document that youth had good experiences of friendships, skills learned, and sporting events. As adults, they often struggled to raise their own children when returning to Indian cultural contexts.\n\nBrave Heart and DeBruyn, psychologists treating American Indian youth, compare psychological trauma caused by massacres, land allotment, and boarding schools to the trauma experienced by Holocaust survivor descendants. Adults who experienced boarding schools as children seek treatment to be able to adequately bond with their children. American Indian groups have created treatment processes such as the Takini Network: Lakota Holocaust Survivors' Association to treat youth and adults through cultural competence, participation in traditional ceremonies, and grief management.\n\nThe Armenian genocide began in 1915 when the Turkish government planned to wipe out Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. About 2 million Armenians were killed and many more were removed from the country by force. The Turkish government does not acknowledge the events of the Armenian genocide as genocide.\n\nThe biggest demographic shift is the number of children that were internally displaced within the Ottoman Empire. During the Armenian genocide, at least 60,000 youth were transferred to many different locations. Children were taken from their homes and transferred to poorly supplied camps where they would be sold. Some children were sold to central Anatolia to wealthy households for education and assimilation into the Turkish culture. Other children were sold to Muslim villagers who would then receive a stipend each month for raising them. In these instances, the displaced children had typically better lives than what they would have had with Armenian parents. Not all went to these types of homes. Some youth were sold for circumstances of exploitation and unpaid hard labor. Other youth were sent to homes in which they experienced physical and sexual abuse. Some young people were placed in homes of the people who were responsible for their parents' deaths. No matter what type of home they were sent to, the transfer of children involved the stripping of their culture identity. Their Armenian culture was erased by being raised in non-Armenian households; the Turkish government was carrying out a cultural genocide.\n\nNarratives of the stories of the genocide are passed down from generation to generation in order for the story to continue to live on. It allowed the children of future generations to find their sense of ethnic identity through it. There are many different aspects of life in which children begin to form their identity, and in the Armenian culture, an emphasis is placed on the children to identify with the Armenian culture. Though the events of the Armenian genocide are historical facts, the personal stories from witnesses are used as a cultural artifact in the lives of Armenian children. They grow up with this strong sense of belonging to this culture due to these stories of suffering and use them as a uniting force. Armenians are united in this ethnic community, known as the Armenian diaspora. Whether they are Russian or Armenian-Americans, they are part of the Armenian diaspora. The desire for future generations to actively be part of this Armenian diaspora stems from the primary generation and their experiences with the cultural genocide.\n\nFuture generations of genocide survivors recognize the shift in their geographical location due to the genocide. Future generations of Armenian-Americans have been told and retold the stories of how their ancestors came to America, and they recognize that if it had not been for the Armenian genocide, they might not be where they are today. They see the effect of the genocide in that they might still be in Armenia. Future generations of children that are born in Russia recognize that their geographical location within Russia was effected by the genocide. They feel at home in places such as Krasnodar, Russia because that is where their families have migrated to after the genocide. Although the future generations of Armenian genocide survivors have migrated all over the globe and made their homes in these places, their ancestors have instilled a love for Armenia, the historic homeland.\n\nThe Cambodian genocide began in 1975 when Pol Pot, a Khmer Rouge leader, attempted to build a Communist peasant farming society. About 1.5 million Cambodians died.\n\nMany Cambodian youth were taken to Canada in the 1980s. Most came through private sponsorship programs or through the Canadian federal government as refugees. Many of these sponsorship programs were Christian organizations through the \"Master Agreement\" made with the Canadian government. Primarily, families became refugees in Montreal and Toronto. Other small groups of refugees went to Ottawa, Hamilton, London, and Vancouver. Most refugees were of the lowest economic class in Cambodia, and they had less education. An emphasis was placed on getting the children refugees caught up academically with their peers of the same age by sending them to school. Cambodian Canadians preferred to stay in bigger cities such as Toronto because it allowed the children to attend school together. In these areas where the Cambodian population was higher, racism in schools against Cambodian refugees was less evident. Though they were placed in Canada, there was still a stress to maintain Khmer culture. Many parents continued to speak Khmer to their children, keeping the language alive. Khmer décor was hung in homes and Khmer traditions were carried out within the homes as a way to raise the children in Khmer culture.\n\nMany second and third generation youth of survivors of the Cambodian genocide recognize the stories they are told as their primary source of information. The stories they hear discuss the Khmer Rouge in a negative way. Survivor stories include talk about harsh living and working conditions in which they were separated from their families, starved, tortured, and even killed. Other households avoid the subject all together. Some survivors do not want to relive the old traumas so they keep silent. Other survivors cannot make sense of it and do not want to be subject to the questions of youth that they cannot answer.\n\nMany youth in the generations following the genocide experience broken home life. They live in homes controlled by parents with PTSD. The youth experience their parents' hyper arousal, intrusive recollection, traumatic amnesia, and being easily frightened. Even if the parents do not have PTSD, they still often elicit behaviors of emotional unavailability, over protection, and poor parenting on their children. Some children of survivors experience violence in their home such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, or neglect. Children in the following generations who have been raised in violent homes because of their parents' experiences have often elicited violent behaviors. School shootings, stabbings, and knifings have become more common among Cambodians following the genocide. Some youth believe that it is because of the Khmer Rouge and the Cambodian genocide that they suffer from economic hardships.\n\nIn schools following the events of the Cambodian genocide, youth received mixed interpretations of the events of the genocide. Information about the time period in which these events occurred, known as the Democratic Kampuchea, was severely limited or even taken out of textbooks. Children previously participated in Hate Day, a day in which they were taught to hate Pol Pot and disapprove of the Khmer Rouge. Now, the day has become known as the Day of Remembrance in which they remember those who lost their lives during this time.\n\nIt was not just the following generations of the survivors that were affected by the genocide, but the youth of the Khmer Rouge as well. Most youth with parents who were members of the Khmer Rouge do not hear of the events from their parents, but rather find information from museums, neighbors, and friends. Once they find out the cruelty that their parents and grandparents exhibited, they often feel embarrassed and do not want to identify themselves as children of the Khmer Rouge. Many Khmer Rouge members are ashamed and fear ostracism from their peers.\n\nCambodian youth who had been a part of the Cambodian genocide experienced high levels of violence early on in their lives. Many youth survivors have shown symptoms of PTSD. The amount of Cambodian genocide survivors with PTSD is five times higher than the average in the United States. Many survivors also experience panic disorder.\n\nThere are children who survived the Cambodian genocide that may not have experienced the genocide directly, yet they still experienced psychological effects of the genocide through their parents. Parents often elicited anger towards their children following the Cambodian genocide. This anger was frequent and the episodes met the criteria for a panic-attack. When this anger was elicited within the home, trauma recall among the parent and the child was often triggered, resulting in catastrophic cognitions.\n\nGroups of Cambodian refugees often fled to highly populated areas in the country in which they fled to. Within these countries, they often resided in poorer areas of the city, which were considered high violence areas. Youth who experienced high violence in Cambodia and then moved to high violence areas in other countries are at greater risk for developing PTSD.\n\nMilitary agrarianism was stressed under the Khmer Rouge, meaning young people were expected to be peasants and soldiers as part of the war effort. Prior to this time of war, youth was defined as a time free from responsibilities, typically ages seven to twenty-one. At the end of this time, youth would transition into adulthood via getting a job, having a family, and gaining responsibility. As youth became a part of the war effort, this transition was delayed. Youth were not able to transition into adulthood until almost age thirty. Instead of gaining more responsibility, youth stayed in a time of which they were disciplined, controlled, and homogenized by military leaders.\n\nSome child victims of the genocide who were able to escape the Khmer Rouge and flee to other countries were able to stay on track with their transition into adulthood. Many children were put in schools right away in order to keep them on the same academic level as their peers. Parents encouraged children to finish school, find work, and pursue family life in the same manner as their peers.\n\nThe Holocaust began in 1933 prior to World War II in Germany when the Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler's rule attempted to wipe out the \"inferior\" people of the country. This primarily included people of the Jewish culture, but also included Gypsies, the disabled, some Slavic people, Jehovah's Witnesses, and homosexuals. By the end of the Holocaust in 1945, more than 6 million Jewish people had been killed. Of these 6 million that had been killed, 1.5 million were children between ages zero and eighteen. By killing off many Jewish children, the Nazi regime hoped to exterminate the core and root of the Jewish culture.\n\nFollowing the Holocaust, survivors did not know where to go. Young survivors had grown up inside the concentration camps or Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe. It was near impossible for them to return to their hometowns because of the hatred against Jews. Many youth and other survivors migrated west to other European territories that were under the rule of the Allies of World War II where they were housed in refugee housing. Many survivors found home in Palestine, legally or illegally. The State of Israel was also established in May 1948 due to the mass displacement of refugees. Quota restrictions on immigration to the United States were also loosened, allowing many Holocaust survivors to immigrate to the United States where they were provided with US immigration visas for displaced persons under the Displaced Persons Act. Other places that Jewish refugees fled to were Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, South America, and South Africa.\n\nSurvivors of the Holocaust lived through very traumatic experiences, and their children and grandchildren felt the repercussions of this trauma. Generations following the Holocaust learned to have a distrust of the world. They were taught that the world and the people in it were inherently bad and could not be trusted, producing an ever-present fear of danger. Parents gave youth a terrifying worldview by failing to provide an effective framework of security and stability. Parents viewed the world as inherently bad, and they often inflicted overprotectiveness on their children. Children of survivors of the Holocaust grew up with many restrictions to their daily lives as parents took on controlling roles in order to protect their children from the outside world.\n\nSurvivors of the Holocaust received little to no education while in the concentration camps.They lost all opportunity to advance academically. Children of survivors feel the repercussions of the Holocaust by the parents' constant pressure for them to achieve academically. The role of the child within the family was to provide hope for the future, creating a sense of over involvement of the parents in the children's lives. Children viewed their parents as living vicariously through them; the parents were stripped of a childhood experience and must experience it through their own children. Due to the lack of education, survivors sometimes lacked communication skills. The communication skills they passed on to their children could be affected. An inability to communicate feelings was impressed on children when they were never taught the proper way to do so. The communication that occurred within the home also reflected the knowledge of the Holocaust events that were passed down to further generations. Some parents who survived the Holocaust were very vocal about the events, providing accurate stories to their children to allow the survivor to present the traumatic experience without becoming distant from it. Other parents did not directly recount their traumatic experiences to their children, rather young people became aware of the experiences through hearing the conversations their parents had with others. Some parents did not talk about it at all; they did not want to remember it, were afraid of remembering it, and ashamed of remembering it because of how traumatic the experiences were.\n\nSecond and third generations of Holocaust survivors have also inherited PTSD symptoms. Because their parents or grandparents have developed such severe PTSD, youth in the following generations have a predisposition to developing PTSD. This predisposition could have been due to the way they were raised. Second and third generations of survivors could also experience subsequent childhood traumas inflicted from their parents or grandparents. Depression in parent survivors is very prevalent, and children of these survivors are more vulnerable to developing depression as well. Behavior disorders were also more prevalent in children of survivors of the Holocaust.\n\nYouth that grew up as victims of the Holocaust also experienced many psychological effects. One effect was that of learned helplessness. They grew up believing that they were inferior to everyone else, creating a victim mindset. They also had inherent feelings of abandonment, loneliness, and a sense of being unwanted. Being separated from their parents, separated from everyone they knew, they grew up thinking that everyone left them. Being constantly moved around they were not able to make concrete relationships and became lonely. Youth were raised in concentration camps where if they were not valuable they would be exterminated; proving themselves was used as a survival tactic. The feeling of needing to prove themselves carried over in every day life even as the war ended and they were no longer victims of the Holocaust. As another means of survival, children often had to alter their identities. They rid themselves of Jewish names and tendencies in order to survive. During the Holocaust they grew up believing that they should be ashamed of who they were and their identity. When the war ended, they struggled with returning to their Jewish life. Youth questioned who they were and struggled with finding their identity.\n\nMany young people that experienced the Holocaust became suicidal. They lost the desire to exist or felt a deep disgust at the idea of living. Germans questioned why Jews in the ghettos did not commit mass suicide because of how hard the Germans had made life for the Jews. Some youth survivors used the Nazi domination to fuel their desire to live and desire to fight back.\n\nYouth who experienced the Holocaust at an early age were consequently stripped of their childhood in that they were prevented from having a normal childhood. They were forced to transition into adulthood much more quickly than those who were not victims of this genocide. As children, they had to be adults because it was dangerous to be a child. Children were often targeted groups of people to be exterminated during the Holocaust due to the fact that they could not help the Nazi regime. Young people had to prove themselves beneficial in order to survive, which for them meant becoming adults early on in age. Children survivors have grown up and created an alter ego child who desires to live the childish life that they missed out on due to the Holocaust.\n\nSome youth transitioned into adulthood in that they became very future oriented and determined to plan for the future. They planned on how they would continue on life after the Holocaust. Their goal was to live in a manner much like how they had lived before the genocide began. They also talked about achieving more than their parents ever had. Some youth talked about travel and studying abroad, becoming well versed in other languages and cultures. Youth were forced to focus on the future and plan for it rather than dwell in the youth years and childish lifestyle.\n"}

Along with other members of his family who died later, Puccini is buried in a small chapel inside the Villa, in a room transformed into a mausoleum after his death.\n\nThe Puccini Festival was started in 1930 following what is believed to have been Puccini's comment to friend Giovacchino Forzano, one of his librettists, in 1924 just before he left for the clinic in Brussels for his throat operation: \"I always come out here and take a boat to go and shoot snipes … but once I would like to come here and listen to one of my operas in the open air.\" The composer was thought to be expressing the hope that his operas would be performed in the extraordinary natural stage offered by the Massaciuccoli Lake. However, this was disputed by his granddaughter, Simonetta Puccini.\n\nNevertheless, on 24 August 1930, together with Pietro Mascagni, who had been fellow student of Puccini's, Forzano produced the first performances of a Puccini opera on the lake shore, in front of the Maestro's house. In a provisional theatre, the \"Carro di Tespi Lirico\" with its stage built on piles stuck in the lake, a travelling opera company performed \"La bohème\" directed by Forzano and conducted by Mascagni. The same company came back in 1931 when Beniamino Gigli and Adelaide Saraceni performed in \"La bohème\", while Rosetta Pampanini and Angelo Michetti performed \"Madama Butterfly\". This was the beginning of what was to become a major opera festival.\n\nHowever, in the years before 1949, due to the political and financial climate, there was only one presentation—in 1937—and that was a concert. Returning in 1949 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Puccini's death, the Festival re-opened with \"La fanciulla del West\" and continued into the 1950s with many of the composer's most well known works.\n\nNot until 1966, when the Festival site was moved to reclaimed land just north of and near to the small lake harbour, did the Puccini Festival became an annual summer event. With its small villages on the opposite shore, whose flickering lights at night provide unforgettable natural scenery to complement the performances taking place on the stage, the location proved a success, although the theatre's ultra modern design and size have sometimes been drawbacks.\n\nAfter the creation of the \"Puccini Festival Foundation\" in 1990, achieved in order to put the event on a more established financial footing, plans were put in place to create a new open-air theatre with up-to-date facilities and acoustics. The town authorities of Viareggio purchased of land to create the \"Parco della Musica\" (Music Park) and on it constructed the \"Teatro al Aperto\" (the Outdoor Theatre) now seating 3,200. In addition, other facilities for rehearsals and workshops were built, along with a 600-seat covered studio theatre. The \"Teatro al Aperto\" was built to take advantage of the view across Massaciuccoli Lake in the background.\n\nIn over seventy years of the Festival, the stage of Torre del Lago has hosted the most famous and acclaimed names of world opera. Among them was Tito Gobbi, who also made his début as director in \"Tosca\"; Mario del Monaco, who chose the Festival as his farewell to the stage in \"Il Tabarro\", and many others who began or ended extraordinary careers.\n\nIn 2000, 70th anniversary of Forzano and Mascagni's initiative, the 46th Puccini Festival presented two major new productions, \"Madama Butterfly\" and \"Tosca\". In addition, the program included Puccini's first opera, \"Le Villi\", presented in concert, with performances by Katia Ricciarelli and Josè Cura. In 2004 the Puccini Festival celebrated its 50th anniversary by a season featuring two great events: one was a new production of \"Madama Butterfly\" celebrating the centenary of its première in Brescia on 28 May 1904. It was conducted by Plácido Domingo with Daniela Dessì and Fabio Armiliato in the leading roles. The second was a special evening dedicated to Puccini's heroines, presenting the most beloved arias from the Maestro's favourite characters, with Plácido Domingo narrating as Puccini.\n\nThe 2006 season was unique in that a production of \"La fanciulla del West\" was presented rather later in the traditional season with follow-up performances in Monaco in October. Many productions originating at the festival have gone on to appear in opera houses throughout the world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was a member of the Italian noble and Boyar princely Rossetti family.\n\nRossetti was born in Vasto in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies; the original family of his ancestors was della Gherardesca. Since many members of the della Gherardesca family had red hair, they adopted the nickname \"Rossetti\" approximately four generations before Gabriele's birth. He was a Roman Catholic. Rossetti's support for Italian revolutionary nationalism forced him into political exile in 1821.\n\nRossetti's first edition of poems was printed in 1807 by Giovanni Avalloni, who offered to have Rossetti's poems published after hearing him recite a few passages. Throughout his early career, Rossetti published poems that were \"patriotic\" and supported the \"popular movement\" in Sicily which resulted in him receiving a grant from Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies in 1820. When the king revoked the constitution in 1821, many supporters of the constitution were persecuted, but Rossetti instead, was forced into exile in Malta for three years before a British admiral of the Royal Navy sent Rossetti to London in 1824. He held the post of Professor of Italian at King's College London from 1831, as well as teaching Italian at King's College School, until failing eyesight led to his retirement in 1847.\nRossetti's published works include literary criticism, Romantic poetry such as his long poem \"Il veggente in solitudine\" of 1846, and his \"Autobiography\". He is thought to be the basis of the character Pesca in Wilkie Collins' 1860 novel \"The Woman in White\".\n\nHe also wrote commentaries on Dante Alighieri in which he attempted to show evidence of mysterious ancient conspiracies in his works.\n\nHe married Frances Polidori, daughter of another Italian exile Gaetano Polidori, and they had four children, all distinguished writers or artists: \n\nRossetti died in London, aged 71.\n\n\n"}

Some references give the spelling of his last name as Chissov ().\n\nLieutenant Chisov was a navigator on a Soviet Air Force Ilyushin Il-4 bomber. In January 1942, Luftwaffe fighters attacked his bomber, forcing him to bail out. Nikolai Zhugan, a crewman on Chisov's flight, later said that Chisov leapt from the plane at an altitude of approximately 7,000 meters (23,000 feet), though other references list Chisov's fall at 6,700 meters (Zhugan himself waited until the plane was at about 500 meters before also bailing out).\n\nWith the air battle still raging around him, Chisov intentionally did not open his parachute, since he feared that he would be an easy target for an angry German pilot while he was dangling from his parachute harness. He planned to drop below the level of the battle, and open his chute, when he was out of sight of the fighters. Due to the thin atmosphere at that altitude, however, he lost consciousness and was unable to pull the rip cord.\n\nChisov struck the edge of a snowy ravine at an estimated speed of somewhere between , then slid, rolled, and plowed his way to the bottom. The aerial battle had been seen by cavalry commander General Pavel Alexeyevich Belov. When Chisov was seen falling to the ground, cavalrymen rushed to the site, and were surprised to find Chisov alive, still wearing his unopened parachute. Chisov regained consciousness a short time later.\n\nChisov suffered severe injuries, including spinal injuries and a broken pelvis. He was operated on by surgeon Y. Gudynsky, and for a month his condition was considered critical. Despite his injuries, he was able to fly again three months later. He requested to continue flying combat missions, but was instead sent to become a navigational trainer.\n\nChisov flew over 70 combat missions during the course of his career.\n\nAfter the war, he graduated from the Military-Political Academy. On his departure from the reserve, he became a propagandist for the Central House of the Soviet Army.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52579959", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52579959", "title": "Lavender Town", "text": "Lavender Town\n\nLavender Town is a very small village that can be visited in \"Pokémon Red\", \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Gold\", \"Silver\", \"Crystal\", and the remakes thereof. It is home to the \"Pokémon Tower\", a Japanese-style graveyard filled with hundreds of tombstones for deceased Pokémon. Hence, the village is suggested to be a haunted location, and the player character can come across ghost-type Pokémon here. The Pokémon Tower was replaced by the \"Kanto Radio Tower\" in \"Pokémon Silver\" and \"Gold\". Lavender Town is also home to the \"Name Rater\", which allows players to change the nickname of their Pokémon, and a care home for abandoned Pokémon.\n\nThe Pokémon Tower makes an appearance in the first season of the \"Pokémon\" anime series, when its main characters search for ghost-type Pokémon for a difficult gym battle. Lavender Town also appears in the \"Pokémon Adventures\" and \"The Electric Tale of Pikachu\" manga series.\n\nThe background music of Lavender Town has garnered much interest due to some listeners finding it unsettling. Listing it as the second-most scary video game track in 2012, Brittany Vincent of \"Bloody Disgusting\" stated that Lavender Town's \"deceptively calm ... tune ranks highly on most gamers' lists of terrifying childhood memories.\" Lavender Town's music, composed by Junichi Masuda, combines sharp chiptune sounds with \"a cavalcade of jarring chords\" to create an eerie atmosphere. Jay Hathaway of \"Gawker\" stated that leaving the music on loop may cause a \"vague sense of dread\".\n\nAccording to a creepypasta story that was uploaded anonymously on Pastebin in 2010, the music of Lavender Town compelled the suicide of over 100 Japanese children in the spring of 1996. Others allegedly suffered nosebleeds, headaches, or became irrationally angry. According to this urban legend, high pitch binaural beats harmed the brains of children in a way adults were immune to. This fabricated illness was dubbed \"Lavender Town Syndrome\" and the original story went viral after being spread on general interest websites such as 4chan. Various people have added details to make the story more convincing over time, such as Photoshopping images of ghosts into spectrogram outputs of the Lavender Town music. Mark Hill of \"Kill Screen\" stated that the appeal of the Lavender Town Syndrome legend \"comes from corrupting such an innocent symbol of childhood,\" and drew comparisons with \"Dennō Senshi Porygon\", an episode of the \"Pokémon\" anime series that gave hundreds of Japanese children seizures.\n\nThe \"Lavender Town\" theme was re-recorded for the 2017 \"Pokémon Go\" Halloween event.\n\nThe player character can battle their rival, Blue, in the Pokémon Tower. Fans of the series have noted that Blue's Raticate, a Pokémon he uses for every battle up to that point, does not appear in this fight or subsequent confrontations. This lead fans to speculate that Blue's Pokémon had died in a previous battle and that Blue came to the Pokémon Tower to bury and mourn his Raticate.\n\n\"Eurogamer\" described Lavender Town as a \"standout location\" in the original \"Pokémon\" games, as it is one of the few locations in the franchise that deals with the fact that the \"cute and cuddly\" Pokémon could actually die.\n"}

The unwholesome spectres of the restless dead, the \"lemures\" or \"larvae\" were propitiated with offerings of beans. On those days, the Vestals would prepare sacred \"mola salsa\", a salted flour cake, from the first ears of wheat of the season.\nIn the Julian calendar the three days of the feast were 9, 11, and 13 May. The origin myth of this ancient festival, according to Ovid, who derives \"Lemuria\" from a supposed \"Remuria\" was that it had been instituted by Romulus to appease the spirit of Remus (Ovid, \"Fasti\", V.421ff; Porphyrius). Ovid notes that at this festival it was the custom to appease or expel the evil spirits by walking barefoot and throwing black beans over the shoulder at night. It was the head of the household who was responsible for getting up at midnight and walking around the house with bare feet throwing out black beans and repeating the incantation, \"I send these; with these beans I redeem me and mine\" (\"Haec ego mitto; his redimo meque meosque fabis .\") nine times. The household would then clash bronze pots while repeating, \"Ghosts of my fathers and ancestors, be gone!\" nine times. \n\nBecause of this annual exorcism of the noxious spirits of the dead, the whole month of May was rendered unlucky for marriages, whence the proverb \"Mense Maio malae nubent\" (\"They wed ill who wed in May\").\n\nAccording to some cultural historians, this ancient custom was Christianized when either in 609 or 610, Pope Boniface IV consecrated the Pantheon at Rome to the Blessed Virgin and \"all the martyrs\"; the feast of that \"dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres\" has been celebrated at Rome ever since and started the feast of All Saints' Day.

{"id": "170487", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170487", "title": "Majestic 12", "text": "Majestic 12\n\nIn UFO conspiracy theories, Majestic 12 (or MJ-12) is the code name of an alleged secret committee of scientists, military leaders, and government officials, formed in 1947 by an executive order by U.S. President Harry S. Truman to facilitate recovery and investigation of alien spacecraft. The concept originated in a series of supposedly leaked secret government documents first circulated by ufologists in 1984. Upon examination, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) declared the documents to be \"completely bogus\", and many ufologists consider them to be an elaborate hoax. Majestic 12 remains popular among some UFO conspiracy theorists and the concept has appeared in popular culture including television, film and literature.\n\nThe concept of \"Majestic Twelve\" emerged during a period in the 1980s when ufologists believed there had been a cover-up of the Roswell UFO incident and speculated some secretive upper tier of the United States government was responsible. Their suppositions appeared to be confirmed in 1984 when ufologist Jaime Shandera received an envelope containing film which, when developed, showed images of eight pages of documents that appeared to be briefing papers describing \"Operation Majestic Twelve\". The documents purported to reveal a secret committee of twelve, supposedly authorized by United States President Harry S. Truman in 1952, and explain how the crash of an alien spacecraft at Roswell in 1947 had been concealed, how the recovered alien technology could be exploited, and how the United States should engage with extraterrestrial life in the future.\n\nShandera and his ufologist colleagues Stanton T. Friedman and Bill Moore say they later received a series of anonymous messages that led them to find what has been called the \"Cutler/Twining memo\" in 1985 while searching declassified files in the National Archives. Purporting to be written by President Eisenhower's assistant Robert Cutler to General Nathan F. Twining and containing a reference to Majestic 12, the memo is widely held to be a forgery, likely planted as part of a hoax. Historian Robert Goldberg wrote that the ufologists came to believe the story despite the documents being \"obviously planted to bolster the legitimacy of the briefing papers\".\n\nClaiming to be connected to the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations, a man named Richard Doty told filmmaker Linda Moulton Howe that the MJ-12 story was true, and showed Howe unspecified documents purporting to prove the existence of small, grey humanoid aliens originating from the Zeta Reticuli star system. Doty reportedly promised to supply Howe with film footage of UFOs and an interview with an alien being, although no footage ever materialized.\n\nSoon, distrust and suspicion led to disagreements within the ufology community over the authenticity of the MJ-12 documents, and Moore was accused of taking part in an elaborate hoax, while other ufologists and debunkers such as Philip J. Klass were accused of being \"disinformation agents\".\n\nKlass's investigation of the MJ-12 documents found that Robert Cutler was actually out of the country on the date he supposedly wrote the \"Cutler/Twining memo\", and that the Truman signature was \"a pasted-on photocopy of a genuine signature —including accidental scratch marks — from a memo that Truman wrote to Vannevar Bush on October 1, 1947\". Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as \"ridiculous\", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore's personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government's (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.\n\nThe FBI began its own investigation of the supposed \"secret\" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity. The United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations stated that no such committee had ever been authorized or formed, and that the documents were \"bogus\". The FBI subsequently declared the MJ-12 documents to be \"completely bogus\".\n\nLater in 1996, a document called the MJ-12 \"Special Operations Manual\" circulated among ufologists. It is also widely considered to be a fake and \"a continuation of the MJ-12 myth\".\n\nUfologists Linda Moulton Howe and Stanton T. Friedman believe the MJ12 Documents are authentic. Friedman examined the documents and has argued that the United States government has conspired to cover up knowledge of a crashed extraterrestrial spacecraft.\n\nAccording to journalist Howard Blum the name \"Majestic 12\" had been prefigured in the UFO community when Bill Moore asked \"National Enquirer\" reporter Bob Pratt in 1982 to collaborate on a novel called \"MAJIK-12\". Because of this, Blum writes, Pratt had always been inclined to think the Majestic 12 documents a hoax.\n\nScientific skeptic author Brian Dunning investigated the history of the subject, and reported his findings in the 2016 Skeptoid podcast episode \"The Secret History of Majestic 12\". He concluded that, rather than a hoax perpetrated by the UFO community, it is likely the papers were actually part of a disinformation campaign of the US government meant to deflect attention from secret Air Force projects. Referring to the MJ-12 documents, Dunning states:\n\nThe following individuals were described in the Majestic 12 documents as \"designated members\" of Majestic 12.\n\n\n\n"}

The musical is centered on her affair with a French intelligence officer who plays a major role in her arrest and execution and later regrets it. A parallel sequence of events follows a young French soldier who fights in the trenches, illustrating what war is really about. The musical was perceived as an anti-war piece at a time when the US war in Vietnam was sinking in popularity.\n\nThe show's premiere production was directed by Vincente Minnelli and produced in 1967 by David Merrick at National Theatre in Washington, DC. The production lost at least $500,000, and Merrick decided not to bring the show to Broadway. In 1968, after Merrick withdrew his support of the musical, the authors brought a more modest version of it to New York's off-Broadway Theatre DeLys (now the Lucille Lortel Theater) under the title \"Ballad For a Firing Squad\". In 1996, York Theatre in New York revived the 1968 version under the original title \"Mata Hari\". A cast recording of that production was released in 2001.\n\n"}
{"id": "8442323", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8442323", "title": "Mexican Drug War", "text": "Mexican Drug War\n\nThe Mexican Drug War (also known as the Mexican War on Drugs; ) is an ongoing, asymmetric low intensity conflict between the Mexican Government and various drug trafficking syndicates. Since 2006, when the Mexican military began to intervene, the government's principal goal has been to reduce drug-related violence. The Mexican government has asserted that their primary focus is on dismantling the powerful drug cartels, rather than on preventing drug trafficking and demand, which is left to U.S. functionaries.\n\nAlthough Mexican drug trafficking organizations have existed for several decades, their influence increased after the demise of the Colombian Cali and Medellín cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale illicit drug market and in 2007 controlled 90% of the cocaine entering the United States. Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.\n\nFederal law enforcement has been reorganized at least five times since 1982 in various attempts to control corruption and reduce cartel violence. During that same time period there have been at least four elite Special Forces created as new corruption-free soldiers who could do battle with Mexico's endemic bribery system. Analysts estimate that wholesale earnings from illicit drug sales range from $13.6 to $49.4 billion annually.\n\nThe U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico with US$1.6 billion for the Mérida Initiative to provide Mexico with law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. By the end of Felipe Calderón's administration (December 1, 2006 – November 30, 2012), the official death toll of the Mexican Drug War was at least 60,000. Estimates set the death toll above 120,000 killed by 2013, not including 27,000 missing.\n\nDue to its location, Mexico has long been used as a staging and transshipment point for narcotics and contraband between Latin America and U.S. markets. Mexican bootleggers supplied alcohol to the United States gangsters throughout the duration of the Prohibition in the United States, and the onset of the illegal drug trade with the U.S. began when the prohibition came to an end in 1933. Towards the end of the 1960s, Mexican narcotic smugglers started to smuggle drugs on a major scale.\n\nDuring the 1970s and early 1980s, Colombia's Pablo Escobar was the main exporter of cocaine and dealt with organized criminal networks all over the world. When enforcement efforts intensified in South Florida and the Caribbean, the Colombian organizations formed partnerships with the Mexico-based traffickers to transport cocaine by land through Mexico into the United States.\n\nThis was easily accomplished because Mexico had long been a major source of heroin and cannabis, and drug traffickers from Mexico had already established an infrastructure that stood ready to serve the Colombia-based traffickers. By the mid-1980s, the organizations from Mexico were well-established and reliable transporters of Colombian cocaine. At first, the Mexican gangs were paid in cash for their transportation services, but in the late 1980s, the Mexican transport organizations and the Colombian drug traffickers settled on a payment-in-product arrangement.\n\nTransporters from Mexico usually were given 35% to 50% of each cocaine shipment. This arrangement meant that organizations from Mexico became involved in the distribution, as well as the transportation of cocaine, and became formidable traffickers in their own right. In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel and the Gulf Cartel have taken over trafficking cocaine from Colombia to the worldwide markets.\n\nThe balance of power between the various Mexican cartels continually shifts as new organizations emerge and older ones weaken and collapse. A disruption in the system, such as the arrests or deaths of cartel leaders, generates bloodshed as rivals move in to exploit the power vacuum. Leadership vacuums are sometimes created by law enforcement successes against a particular cartel, so cartels often will attempt to pit law enforcement against one another, either by bribing Mexican officials to take action against a rival or by leaking intelligence about a rival's operations to the Mexican or U.S. government's, Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nWhile many factors have contributed to the escalating violence, security analysts in Mexico City trace the origins of the rising scourge to the unraveling of a longtime implicit arrangement between narcotics traffickers and governments controlled by the Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which began to lose its grip on political power in the late 1980s.\n\nThe fighting between rival drug cartels began in earnest after the 1989 arrest of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, who ran the cocaine business in Mexico. There was a lull in the fighting during the late 1990s but the violence has steadily worsened since 2000.\n\nThe centrist PRI party ruled Mexico for around 70 years until 2000. During this time, drug cartels expanded their power and corruption, and anti-drug operations focused mainly on destroying marijuana and opium crops in mountainous regions. There were no large-scale high-profile military operations against their core structures in urban areas until the 2000 Mexican election, when the right-wing PAN party gained the presidency and started a crackdown on cartels in their own turf.\n\nIt is estimated that about 110 people died in Nuevo Laredo between January and August 2005 as a result of the fighting between the Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. The same year, there was another surge in violence in the state of Michoacán as the La Familia Michoacana drug cartel established itself.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the newly elected President Felipe Calderón dispatched 6,500 Mexican Army soldiers to Michoacán, his home state, to end drug violence there. This action is regarded as the first major retaliation made against the cartel violence, and is generally viewed as the starting point of the Mexican Drug War between the government and the drug cartels. As time passed, Calderón continued to escalate his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved along with state and federal police forces.\n\nIn 2012, newly elected president Enrique Peña Nieto emphasized that he did not support the involvement of armed American agents in Mexico, being only interested in allowing the US to continue with their military training of Mexican forces in counter-insurgency tactics. Peña stated that he planed to deescalate the conflict, focusing in lowering criminal violence rates, as opposed to the previous policy of a attacking drug-trafficking organizations by arresting or killing the most-wanted drug lords and intercepting their drug shipments.\n\nHowever in the first 14 months of his administration, between December 2012 and January 2014, 23,640 people died in the conflict. \n\nIn 2013 Mexico saw the rise of the controversial Grupos de Autodefensa Comunitaria (self-defendese groups) in southern Mexico, para-military groups led by land-owners, ranchers and other rural businessmen that took up arms against the criminal groups that wanted to impose dominance in their towns, entering a new phase in the Mexiacan war on drugs. However this strategy, allegedly proposed by General Óscar Naranjo (Peña's security advisor from Colombia), crumbled when autodefenzas started to have internal organization struggles and dissagremts with the goverment, being finally infiltrated by criminal elements, that deprived the goverment forces the hability to distinguish between armed-civilian convoys and drug-cartel convoys, forcing Peña's administration to distance from them.\n\nPeña's handling of the 2014 Iguala mass murder of activist students by hand of corrupt government oficials coluded with a drug cartel and the 2015 escape of drug lord \"El Chapo\" Guzmán from the Altiplano maximum security prison sparked international criticism.\n\nA great part of Peña Nieto's strategy consisted in making the Mexican Interior Ministry the solely responsible for public security and the creation of a national militray level police force called the gendarmerie. In December 2017, the was passed by legislation but was met with criticism, especially from the National Human Rights Commission, accusing it gave the President a blank check.\n\nAndrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO), the President from the National Regeneration Movement party, took office on December 1, 2018. One of his campaign promises was a controversial \"strategy for peace\", that is to give amnesty to all Mexicans involved in drug production and trafficking as a way to stop the drug trade and the resulting turf violence. His proposed amnesty is still ill-defined. His aides explained that the plan was not to pardon real criminals, like drug cartel members, but to prevent other people from following that path, especially low-income and young people that may end up in jail for drug possession. President-elect points out that the past approaches failed because they were based on misunderstanding the core problem. According to him, the underlying issue is Mexico's great social disparities which previous governments' economic policies did not reduce. He promised not to use arms to suppress the people and announced to free political prisoners. His approach is to pay more attention to the victims of violent crime and wants to revisit two previously taken strategies.\n\nMexico is a major drug transit and producing country. It is the main foreign supplier of cannabis and an important entry point of South American cocaine and Asian methamphetamines to the United States. It is believed that almost half the cartels' revenues come from cannabis. Cocaine, heroin, and increasingly methamphetamine are also traded.\n\nThe U.S. State Department estimates that 90% of cocaine entering the United States is produced in Colombia (followed by Bolivia and Peru) and that the main transit route is through Mexico. Drug cartels in Mexico control approximately 70% of the foreign narcotics flow into the United States.\n\nAlthough Mexico accounts for only a small share of worldwide heroin production, it supplies a large share of the heroin distributed in the United States.\n\nSince 2003 Mexican cartels have used the dense, isolated portions of U.S. federal and state parks and forests to grow marijuana under the canopy of thick trees. Billions of dollars’ worth of marijuana has been produced annually on US soil. “In 2006, federal and state authorities seized over 550,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated 1 billion dollars in Kentucky’s remote Appalachian counties” Cartels profited from marijuana growing operations from Arkansas to Hawaii.\n\nThe prevalence of illicit drug use in Mexico is still low compared to the United States; however, with the increased role of Mexico in the trafficking and production of illicit drugs, the availability of drugs has slowly increased locally since the 1980s. In the decades before this period, consumption was not generalized – reportedly occurring mainly among persons of high socioeconomic status, intellectuals and artists.\n\nAs the United States of America is the world's largest consumer of cocaine, as well as of other illegal drugs, their demand is what motivates the drug business, and the main goal of Mexican cartels is to introduce narcotics into the US.\n\nThe export rate of cocaine to the U.S. has decreased following stricter border control measures in response to the September 11 attacks.\n\nThis has led to a surplus of cocaine which has resulted in local Mexican dealers attempting to offload extra narcotics along trafficking routes, especially in border areas popular among low income North American tourists.\n\nDrug shipments are often delayed in Mexican border towns before delivery to the US, which has forced drug traffickers to increase prices to account for transportation costs of products across international borders, making it a more profitable business for the drug lords, and has likely contributed to the increased rates of local drug consumption.\n\nWith increased cocaine use, there has been a parallel rise in demand for drug user treatment in Mexico.\n\nOne of the main factors driving the Mexican Drug War is the willingness of mainly lower-class people to earn easy money joining criminal organizations, and the failure of the government to provide the legal means for the creation of well paid jobs. From 2004 to 2008 the portion of the population who received less than half of the median income rose from 17% to 21% and the proportion of population living in extreme or moderate poverty rose from 35 to 46% (52 million persons) between 2006 and 2010.\n\nAmong the OECD countries, Mexico has the second highest degree of economic disparity between the extremely poor and extremely rich. The bottom ten percent in the income hierarchy disposes of 1.36% of the country's resources, whereas the upper ten percent dispose of almost 36%. OECD also notes that Mexico's budgeted expenses for poverty alleviation and social development is only about a third of the OECD average.\n\nIn 2012 it was estimated that Mexican cartels employed over 450,000 people directly and a further 3.2 million people's livelihoods depended on various parts of the drug trade. In cities such as Ciudad Juárez, up to 60% of the economy depended on illegitimate money making.\n\nIlliteracy and lack of education have been present in Mexico for much of its history. In 1940, 58% of all Mexicans over the age of six were illiterate; in 1960, 38% were illiterate. The 1960 national census found that as to all Mexicans over the age of five, 43.7% had not completed one year of school, 50.7% had completed six years or less of school, and only the remaining 5.6% had continued their education beyond six years of school.\n\nMore recently, researchers from the World Economic Forum have noted that despite Mexico's relatively high investment of 5.3% of its GDP in education as of 2009 (31st out of 134 economies), the nation's primary education system is ranked 116th, thereby suggesting \"that the problem is not how much but rather how resources are invested\". The WEF further explained: \"The powerful teachers union, the National Union of Education Workers (SNTE), the largest labor union in Latin America, has been in large part responsible for blocking reforms that would increase the quality of spending and help ensure equal access to education. Poor teacher performance and learning outcomes are associated with the SNTE-dominated, centralized collective bargaining for many work rules[.]\" The result of the high levels of poverty, lack of well paid jobs, government corruption, and the systemic failure of Mexico's schools has been the appearance of \"los ninis\", an underclass of several million dropouts who \"ni trabajan ni estudian\" (neither work nor study), of whom many ended up as combatants on behalf of the cartels.\n\nHowever, teachers unions argue that they oppose being tested and graded on their students' performance with universally standard exams that do not take into account the socio-economic differences between middle class urban schools and under-equipped poor rural schools, which has an important effect on the students performance. Also, teachers argue that the legislations are ambiguous, only focus on the teachers, without touching the Education Ministry, and will allow more abuses and more political corruption.\n\nThe birth of most Mexican drug cartels is traced to former Mexican Judicial Federal Police agent Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo (\"The Godfather\"), who founded the Guadalajara Cartel in 1980 and controlled most of the illegal drug trade in Mexico and the trafficking corridors across the Mexico–U.S. border along with Juan García Ábrego throughout the 1980s. He started off by smuggling marijuana and opium into the U.S., and was the first Mexican drug chief to link up with Colombia's cocaine cartels in the 1980s. Through his connections, Félix Gallardo became the person at the forefront of the Medellín Cartel, which was run by Pablo Escobar. This was easily accomplished because Félix Gallardo had already established a marijuana trafficking infrastructure that stood ready to serve the Colombia-based cocaine traffickers.\n\nThere were no cartels at that time in Mexico. Félix Gallardo was the lord of Mexican drug smugglers. He oversaw all operations; there was just him, his cronies, and the politicians who sold him protection. However, the Guadalajara Cartel suffered a major blow in 1985 when the group's co-founder Rafael Caro Quintero was captured, and later convicted, for the murder of DEA agent Enrique Camarena. Félix Gallardo afterwards kept a low profile and in 1987 he moved with his family to Guadalajara. According to Peter Dale Scott, the Guadalajara Cartel prospered largely because it enjoyed the protection of the Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS), under its chief Miguel Nazar Haro.\n\nFélix Gallardo \"The Godfather\" was arrested on April 8, 1989. He then decided to divide up the trade he controlled as it would be more efficient and less likely to be brought down in one law enforcement swoop. In a way, he was privatizing the Mexican drug business while sending it back underground, to be run by bosses who were less well known or not yet known by the DEA. Gallardo sent his lawyer to convene the nation's top drug traffickers at a house in the resort of Acapulco where he designated the \"plazas\" or territories.\n\nThe Tijuana route would go to his nephews the Arellano Felix brothers. The Ciudad Juárez route would go to the Carrillo Fuentes family. Miguel Caro Quintero would run the Sonora corridor. Meanwhile, Joaquín Guzmán Loera and Ismael Zambada García would take over Pacific coast operations, becoming the Sinaloa Cartel. Guzmán and Zambada brought veteran Héctor Luis Palma Salazar back into the fold. The control of the Matamoros, Tamaulipas corridor—then becoming the Gulf Cartel—would be left undisturbed to its founder Juan García Ábrego, who was not a party to the 1989 pact.\n\nFélix Gallardo still planned to oversee national operations, as he maintained important connections, but he would no longer control all details of the business. When he was transferred to a high-security prison in 1993, he lost any remaining control over the other drug lords.\n\nIn 1999, Gulf Cartel's leader, Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, hired a group of 37 corrupt former elite military soldiers to work for him. These former Airmobile Special Forces Group (GAFE), and Amphibian Group of Special Forces (GANFE) soldiers became known as Los Zetas and began operating as a private army for the Gulf Cartel. During the early 2000s the Zetas were instrumental in the Gulf Cartel's domination of the drug trade in much of Mexico.\n\nAfter the 2007 arrest and extradition of Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, the Zetas seized the opportunity to strike out on their own. Under the leadership of Heriberto Lazcano, the Zetas, numbering about 300, gradually set up their own independent drug, arms and human-trafficking networks. In 2008, Los Zetas made a deal with ex-Sinaloa cartel commanders, the Beltrán-Leyva brothers and since then, became rivals of their former employer/partner, the Gulf Cartel.\n\nIn early 2010 the Zetas made public their split from the Gulf Cartel and began a bloody war with Gulf Cartel over control of northeast Mexico's drug trade routes. This war has resulted in the deaths of thousands of cartel members and suspected members. Furthermore, due to alliance structures, the Gulf Cartel-Los Zetas conflict drew in other cartels, namely the Sinaloa Cartel which fought the Zetas in 2010 and 2011.\n\nThe Zetas are notorious for targeting civilians, including the mass murder of 72 migrants in the San Fernando massacre.\n\nThe Zetas involved themselves in more than drug trafficking and have also been connected to human trafficking, pipeline trafficked oil theft, extortion, and trading unlicensed CDs. Their criminal network is said to reach far from Mexico including into Central America, the U.S. and Europe.\n\nOn 15 July 2013, the Mexican Navy arrested the top Zeta boss Miguel Treviño Morales.\n\nThe Sinaloa Cartel began to contest the Gulf Cartel's domination of the coveted southwest Texas corridor following the arrest of Gulf Cartel leader Osiel Cárdenas in March 2003. The \"Federation\" was the result of a 2006 accord between several groups located in the Pacific state of Sinaloa. The cartel was led by Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, who was Mexico's most-wanted drug trafficker with an estimated net worth of U.S. $1 billion made him the 1140th richest man in the world and the 55th most powerful, according to his \"Forbes\" magazine profile. He was arrested and escaped in July 2015, and re-arrested in January 2016. In February 2010, new alliances were formed against Los Zetas and Beltrán-Leyva Cartel.\n\nThe Sinaloa Cartel fought the Juárez Cartel in a long and bloody battle for control over drug trafficking routes in and around the northern city of Ciudad Juárez. The battle eventually resulted in defeat for the Juárez Cartel but not before taking the lives of between 5,000 and 12,000 people. During the war for the turf in Ciudad Juárez the Sinaloa Cartel used several gangs (e.g. Los Mexicles, the Artistas Asesinos and Gente Nueva) to attack the Juárez Cartel. The Juárez Cartel similarly used gangs such as La Línea and the Barrio Azteca to fight the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nAs of May 2010, numerous reports by Mexican and U.S. media stated that Sinaloa had infiltrated the Mexican federal government and military, and colluded with it to destroy the other cartels. The Colima, Sonora and Milenio Cartels are now branches of the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\nThe Gulf Cartel (Cartel del Golfo), based in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, has been one of Mexico's two dominant cartels in recent years. In the late 1990s, it hired a private mercenary army (an enforcer group now called Los Zetas), which in 2006 stepped up as a partner but, in February 2010, their partnership was dissolved and both groups engaged in widespread violence across several border cities of Tamaulipas state, turning several border towns into \"ghost towns\".\n\nThe Gulf Cartel (CDG) was strong at the beginning of 2011, holding off several Zetas incursions into its territory. However, as the year progressed, internal divisions led to intra-cartel battles in Matamoros and Reynosa, Tamaulipas state. The infighting resulted in several arrests and deaths in Mexico and in the United States. The CDG has since broken apart, and it appears that one faction, known as Los Metros, has overpowered its rival Los Rojos faction and is now asserting its control over CDG operations.\n\nThe infighting has weakened the CDG, but the group seems to have maintained control of its primary plazas, or smuggling corridors, into the United States. The Mexican federal government has made notable successes in capturing the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, his brothers Antonio Cárdenas Guillén, Mario Cárdenas Guillén, and Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez have all been captured and incarcerated during Felipe Calderón's administration.\n\nLa Familia Michoacana was a major Mexican drug cartel based in Michoacán between at least 2006 and 2011. It was formerly allied to the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, but split off and became an independent organization.\n\nIn 2009–10, a counter-narcotics offensive by Mexican and U.S. government agencies produced the arrest of at least 345 suspected La Familia members in the U.S., and the incorrectly presumed death of one of the cartel's founders, Nazario Moreno González, on December 9, 2010. The cartel then divided into the Knights Templar Cartel and a José de Jesús Méndez Vargas-led faction, which kept the name La Familia. Following the cartel's fragmentation in late 2010 and early 2011, the La Familia Cartel under Méndez Vargas fought the Knights Templar Cartel but on June 21, 2011 Méndez Vargas was arrested by Mexican authorities and in mid-2011 the attorney general in Mexico (PGR) stated that La Familia Cartel had been \"exterminated\", leaving only the splinter group, the Knights Templar Cartel.\n\nIn February 2010, La Familia forged an alliance with the Gulf Cartel against Los Zetas and Beltrán-Leyva Cartel.\n\nThe Tijuana Cartel, also known as the Arellano Félix Organization, was once among Mexico's most powerful. It is based in Tijuana, one of the most strategically important border towns in Mexico, and continues to export drugs even after being weakened by an internal war in 2009. Due to infighting, arrests and the deaths of some of its top members, the Tijuana Cartel is a fraction of what it was in the 1990s and early 2000s, when it was considered one of the most potent and violent criminal organizations in Mexico by the police. After the arrest or assassination of various members of the Arellano Félix clan, the cartel is currently headed by Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano, a nephew of the Arellano Félix brothers.\n\nThe Knights Templar drug cartel (Spanish: \"Caballeros Templarios\") was created in Michoacán in March 2011 after the death of the charismatic leader of La Familia Michoacana cartel, Nazario Moreno González. The Cartel is headed by Enrique Plancarte Solís and Servando Gómez Martínez who formed the Knights Templar due to differences with José de Jesús Méndez Vargas, who had assumed leadership of La Familia Michoacana.\n\nAfter the emergence of the Knights Templar, sizable battles flared up during the spring and summer months between the Knights Templar and La Familia. The organization has grown from a splinter group to a dominant force over La Familia, and at the end of 2011, following the arrest of José de Jesús \"El Chango\" Méndez Vargas, leader of La Familia, the cartel appeared to have taken over the bulk of La Familia's operations in Mexico and the U.S. In 2011 the Knights Templar appeared to have aligned with the Sinaloa Federation in an effort to root out the remnants of La Familia and to prevent Los Zetas from gaining a more substantial foothold in the Michoacán region of central Mexico.\nAlliances or agreements between drug cartels have been shown to be fragile, tense and temporary.\nMexican drug cartels have increased their co-operation with U.S. street and prison gangs to expand their distribution networks within the U.S.\nOn March 31, 2014, Enrique Plancarte Solís, a high-ranking leader in the cartel, was killed by the Mexican Navy.\n\nOn 6 September 2016, A Mexican police helicopter was shot down by a gang, killing four people. The police were conducting an operation against criminal groups and drug cartels in Apatzingán, including the Knights Templar Cartel, a suspect.\n\nThe Beltrán-Leyva Cartel was a Mexican drug cartel and organized crime syndicate founded by the four Beltrán Leyva brothers: Marcos Arturo, Carlos, Alfredo and Héctor. In 2004 and 2005, Arturo Beltrán Leyva led powerful groups of assassins to fight for trade routes in northeastern Mexico for the Sinaloa Cartel. Through the use of corruption or intimidation, the Beltrán-Leyva Cartel was able to infiltrate Mexico's political, judicial and police institutions to feed classified information about anti-drug operations, and even infiltrated the Interpol office in Mexico.\n\nFollowing the December 2009 death of the cartel's leader Arturo Beltrán Leyva by Mexican Marines the cartel entered into an internal power struggle between Arturo's brother, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, and Arturo's top enforcer Edgar Valdez Villarreal. Meanwhile, the cartel continued to dissolve with factions such as the South Pacific Cartel, La Mano Con Ojos, Independent Cartel of Acapulco, and La Barredora forming and the latter two cartels starting yet another intra-Beltrán Leyva Cartel conflict.\n\nThe Mexican Federal Police considers the cartel to have been disbanded, and the last cartel leader, Héctor Beltrán Leyva, was captured in October 2014.\n\nThe Juárez Cartel controls one of the primary transportation routes for billions of dollars' worth of illegal drug shipments annually entering the United States from Mexico. Since 2007, the Juárez Cartel has been locked in a vicious battle with its former partner, the Sinaloa Cartel, for control of Ciudad Juárez. La Línea is a group of Mexican drug traffickers and corrupt Juárez and Chihuahua state police officers who work as the armed wing of the Juárez Cartel. Vicente Carrillo Fuentes headed the Juárez Cartel until his arrest in 2014.\n\nSince 2011, the Juárez Cartel continues to weaken; however, holds presence in the three main points of entry into El Paso, Texas. The Juárez Cartel is only a shadow of the organization it was a decade ago, and its weakness and inability to effectively fight against Sinaloa's advances in Juarez contributed to the lower death toll in Juarez in 2011.\n\nOn September 1, 2013, Mexican authorities arrested the alleged Juárez Cartel leader Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, alias \"Betty la Fea\" (Ugly Betty) in the western state of Nayarit without any resistance. On October 9, 2014 Mexican forces captured Vicente Carrillo Fuentes in Torreón, Coahuila.\n\nCartels have been engaged in religious propaganda and psychological operations to influence their rivals and those within their area of influence. They use banners or \"narcomantas\" to threaten their rivals. Some cartels hand out pamphlets and leaflets to conduct public relation campaigns. Many cartels have been able to control the information environment by threatening journalists, bloggers, and others who speak out against them. They have elaborate recruitment strategies targeting young adults to join their cartel groups. They have successfully branded the word \"narco\", and the word has become part of Mexican culture. There is music, television shows, literature, beverages, food, and architecture that all have been branded \"narco\".\n\nParamilitary groups work alongside cartels to provide protection. This protection began with a focus on maintaining the drug trade; however, paramilitary groups now secure other valuable industries such as oil and mining. It has been suggested that the rise in paramilitary groups coincides with a loss of security within the government. These paramilitary groups came about in a number of ways. First, waves of elite armed forces and government security experts have left the government to join the side of the cartels, responding to large bribes and an opportunity for wealth they may not have received in government positions. One such paramilitary group, the Zetas, employed military personnel to create one of the largest groups in Mexico. Some of the elite armed forces members who join paramilitaries are trained in the School of the Americas. These paramilitaries have sprung out of deregulation of the Mexican army, which has been slowly replaced by private security firms. Paramilitaries, including the Zetas, have now entered uncharted territories. Branching out of just protecting drug cartels, paramilitary groups have entered many other financially profitable industries, such as oil, gas, kidnapping, and counterfeiting electronics. There has been a complete and total loss of control by the government and the only response has been to increase army presence, notably an army whose officials are often on the drug cartels payroll. The United States has stepped in to offer support in the “War on Drugs” through funding, training and military support, and transforming the Mexican judicial system to parallel the American system.\n\nMexicans have a constitutional right to own firearms, but legal purchase from the single Mexican gun shop in Mexico City is extremely difficult. Firearms that make their way to Mexico come from the American civilian market. Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through Guatemalan borders, as leftovers from past central-American conflicts. However some grenades are also smuggled from the U.S. to Mexico or stolen from the Mexican military.\n\nThe most common weapons used by the cartels are the AR-15, M16, M4, AK-47, and AKM assault rifles. Handguns are very diverse, but the FN Five-seven (dubbed \"Matapolicías\" or \"Cop-killer\" by criminals) is a popular choice due to its armor-piercing capability. Grenade launchers are known to have been used against Mexican security forces, H&K G36s and M4 carbines with M203 grenade launchers have been confiscated.\n\nSome researchers have asserted that most weapons and arms trafficked into Mexico come from gun dealers in the United States. There is also strong evidence for this conclusion, indicating that many of the traceable weapons come from the failed American government Operation \"Fast and Furious\", and there is a geographic coincidence between the supposed American origin of the firearms and the places where these weapons are seized: Mainly in the northern Mexican states Most grenades and rocket-launchers are smuggled through Guatemalan borders from Central America. However some grenades are also smuggled from the US to Mexico or stolen from the Mexican military. DHS officials have stated that the statistic is misleading: out of approximately 30,000 weapons seized in drug cases in Mexico in 2004–2008, 7,200 appeared to be of U.S. origin, approximately 4,000 were found in ATF manufacturer and importer records, and 87 percent of those—3,480—originated in the United States.\n\nIn an effort to control smuggling of firearms, the U.S. government is assisting Mexico with technology, equipment and training. Project Gunrunner was one such efforts between the U.S. and Mexico to collaborate in tracing Mexican guns which were manufactured in or imported legally to the U.S.\n\nIn 2008, it was falsely reported that ninety percent of arms either captured in Mexico or interdicted were from the United States. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and others have dispelled these claims, pointing that the Mexican sample submitted for ATF tracing is the fraction of weapons seized that appear to have been made in the U.S. or imported into the U.S.\n\nIn 2015, Official reports of the U.S. government and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and explosives (ATF) revealed that over the last years, Mexican cartels improved their firearm power, and that 70% of their weapons come from the U.S. Many of those guns were manufactured in Romania and Bulgaria, and then imported into the U.S. The Mexican cartels acquire those firearms mainly in the southern states of Texas, Arizona and California. After the United States, the top five countries of origin of firearms seized from Mexico were Spain, China, Italy, Germany and Romania. These five countries represent 17% of firearms smuggled into Mexico \n\nATF Project Gunrunner has stated that the official objective is to stop the sale and export of guns from the United States into Mexico in order to deny Mexican drug cartels the firearms considered \"tools of the trade\". However, in February 2011, it brought about a scandal when the project was accused of accomplishing the opposite by ATF permitting and facilitating \"straw purchase\" firearm sales to traffickers, and allowing the guns to \"walk\" and be transported to Mexico. Allegedly, the ATF allowed to complete the transactions to expose the supply chain and gather intelligence. It has been established that this operation violated long-established ATF policies and practices and that it is not a recognized investigative technique. Several of the guns sold under the Project Gunrunner were recovered from crime scenes in Arizona, and at crime scenes throughout Mexico, resulting in considerable controversy.\n\nOne notable incident was the \"Black Swan operation\" where Joaquín Guzmán Loera was finally captured. The ATF confirmed that one of the weapons the Mexican Navy seized from Guzmán's gunmen was one of the many weapons that were \"lost\" during the Project Gunrunner \n\nMany weapons from Project Gunrunner were found in a secret compartment from the \"safe house\" of José Antonio Marrufo \"El Jaguar\", one of Guzmán's most sanguinary lieutenants. He is accused of many killings in Ciudad Juárez, including the notorious massacre of 18 patients of the reahabilitation center \"El Aliviane\". It is believed that Marrufo armed his gunmen with weapons purchased in the United States.\n\nAlthough violence between drug cartels had been occurring long before the war began, the government held a generally passive stance regarding cartel violence in the 1990s and early 2000s. That changed on December 11, 2006, when newly elected President Felipe Calderón sent 6,500 federal troops to the state of Michoacán to end drug violence there (Operation Michoacán). This action is regarded as the first major operation against organized crime, and became the starting point of the war between the government and the drug cartels. Calderón escalated his anti-drug campaign, in which there are now about 45,000 troops involved in addition to state and federal police forces. In 2010 Calderón said that the cartels seek \"to replace the government\" and \"are trying to impose a monopoly by force of arms, and are even trying to impose their own laws.\"\nAs of 2011, Mexico's military captured 11,544 people who were believed to have been involved with the cartels and organized crime. In the year prior, 28,000 individuals were arrested on drug-related charges. The decrease in eradication and drug seizures, as shown in statistics calculated by federal authorities, poorly reflects Calderón's security agenda. Since the war began, over forty thousand people have been killed as a result of cartel violence. During Calderón's presidential term, the murder rate of Mexico has increased dramatically.\n\nAlthough Calderón set out to end the violent warfare between rival cartel leaders, critics argue that he inadvertently made the problem worse. The methods that Calderón adopted involved confronting the cartels directly. These aggressive methods have resulted in public killings and torture from both the cartels and the country's own government forces, which aids in perpetuating the fear and apprehension that the citizens of Mexico have regarding the war on drugs and its negative stigma. As cartel leaders are being removed from their positions, either in the form of arrest or death, power struggles for leadership in the cartels have become more intense, resulting in enhanced violence within the cartels themselves.\n\nCalderón's forces concentrate on taking down cartel members that have a high ranking in the cartel in an attempt to take down the whole organization. The resulting struggle to fill the recently vacated position is one that threatens the existence of many lives in the cartel. Typically, many junior-level cartel members then fight amongst one another, creating more and more chaos. The drug cartels are more aggressive and forceful now than they were in the past and at this point, the cartels hold much of the power in Mexico. Calderón relies heavily on the military to defend and fight against cartel activity. Calderón's military forces have yet to yield significant results in dealing with the violent cartels due in part to the fact that many of the law enforcement officials working for the Mexican government are suspected of being corrupt. There is suspicion that cartels have corrupted and infiltrated the military at a high level, influencing many generals and officers. Mexico's National Human Rights Commission has received nearly 5,800 complaints regarding military abuse since the beginning of the drug war in 2006. Additionally, the National Human Rights Commission has completed nearly 90 in-depth reports since 2007, addressing the many human rights violations towards civilians that have occurred while the military officers were actively participating in law enforcement activities.\n\nViolence in May 2012 in which nearly 50 bodies were found on a local highway between the Mexico–United States border and Monterrey has led to the arrests of 4 high-ranking Mexican military officials. These officials were suspected of being on the cartel payrolls and alerting the cartels in advance of military action against them. Such actions demonstrate that Calderón's significant military offensive will continue to reveal mixed results until the military itself is rid of the corrupting influences of the cartels whom they supposedly aim to persecute.\n\nIn April 2008, General Sergio Aponte, the man in charge of the anti-drug campaign in the state of Baja California, made a number of allegations of corruption against the police forces in the region. Among his allegations, Aponte stated that he believed Baja California's anti-kidnapping squad was actually a kidnapping team working in conjunction with organized crime, and that bribed police units were being used as bodyguards for drug traffickers.\n\nThese accusations sent shock waves through state government. Many of the more than 50 accused officials quit or fled. The progress against drug cartels in Mexico has been hindered by bribery, intimidation, and corruption; four months later the General was relieved of his command.\n\nOn April 26, 2008, a major battle took place between members of the Tijuana and Sinaloa cartels in the city of Tijuana, Baja California, that left 17 people dead.\n\nIn March 2009, President Calderón called in an additional 5,000 Mexican Army troops to Ciudad Juárez. The United States Department of Homeland Security has also said that it is considering using state National Guard troops to help the U.S. Border Patrol counter the threat of drug violence in Mexico from spilling over the border into the US. The governors of Arizona and Texas have encouraged the federal government to use additional National Guard troops from their states to help those already there supporting state law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking.\n\nAccording to the National Drug Intelligence Center, Mexican cartels are the predominant smugglers and wholesale distributors of South American cocaine and Mexico-produced cannabis, methamphetamine and heroin. Mexico's cartels have existed for some time, but have become increasingly powerful in recent years with the demise of the Medellín and Cali cartels in Colombia. The Mexican cartels are expanding their control over the distribution of these drugs in areas controlled by Colombian and Dominican criminal groups, and it is now believed they control most of the illegal drugs coming into the U.S.\n\nNo longer constrained to being mere intermediaries for Colombian producers, Mexican cartels are now powerful organized-crime syndicates that dominate the drug trade in the Americas.\n\nMexican cartels control large swaths of Mexican territory and dozens of municipalities, and they exercise increasing influence in Mexican electoral politics. The cartels are waging violent turf battles over control of key smuggling corridors from Matamoros to San Diego. Mexican cartels employ hitmen and groups of enforcers, known as \"sicarios\". The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration reports that the Mexican drug cartels operating today along the border are far more sophisticated and dangerous than any other organized criminal group in U.S. law enforcement history. The cartels use grenade launchers, automatic weapons, body armor, Kevlar helmets, and sometimes unmanned aerial vehicles. Some groups have also been known to use improvised explosive devices (IEDs).\n\nCasualty numbers have escalated significantly over time. According to a Stratfor report, the number of drug-related deaths in 2006 and 2007 (2,119 and 2,275) more than doubled to 5,207 in 2008. The number further increased substantially over the next two years, from 6,598 in 2009 to over 11,000 in 2010. According to data of the Mexican government, the death numbers are even higher: 9,616 in 2009, 15,273 in 2010, coming to a total of 47,515 killings since their military operations against drug cartels began in 2006, as stated in the government's report of January 2012.\n\nOn 7 October 2012, the Mexican Navy responded to a civilian complaint reporting the presence of armed gunmen in Sabinas, Coahuila. Upon the navy's arrival, the gunmen threw grenades at the patrol from a moving vehicle, triggering a shootout that left Lazcano and another gunman dead and one marine slightly wounded. The vehicle was found to contain a grenade launcher, 12 grenades, possibly a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and two rifles, according to the navy. The Navy managed to confirm his death through fingerprint verification and photographs of his corpse before handing the body to the local authorities. Lazcano is the most powerful cartel leader to be killed since the start of Mexico's Drug War in 2006, according to Reuters.\n\nThis death came just hours after the navy arrested a high-ranking Zeta member in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, Salvador Alfonso Martínez Escobedo.\n\nThe apparent death of Lazcano may benefit three parties: the Mexican Navy, who scored a significant blow to organized crime with the death of Lazcano; Miguel Treviño Morales, who rose as the \"uncontested\" leader of Los Zetas; and Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and the main rival of Los Zetas. \"El Chapo\" is perhaps the biggest winner of the three, since his primary goal is to take over the smuggling routes in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, the headquarters of Treviño Morales. If the body hadn't been stolen, it would also be a symbolic victory for Felipe Calderón, who can say that his administration took down one of the founders and top leaders of Los Zetas and consequently boost the morale of the Mexican military.\n\nAnalysts say that Lazcano's death does not signify the end of Los Zetas. As seen in other instances when top cartel leaders are taken out, fragmenting within the organizations occur, causing short-term violence. Los Zetas have a line of succession when leaders are arrested or killed, but the problem is that most of these replacements are younger, less-experienced members who are likely to resort to violence to maintain their reputation.\n\nTorres Félix, one of the leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel was killed in a gunbattle with the Mexican Army in the community of Oso Viejo in Culiacán, Sinaloa early in the morning on 13 October 2012. His body was sent to the forensic center and was guarded by military-men in order to prevent his henchmen from snatching the body.\n\nAfter the shootout, the military confiscated several stashes of weapons, ammunition, and other materials.\n\nPrior to his death, Torres Félix was a key figure and major drug trafficker for Ismael Zambada García and Joaquín Guzmán Loera, Mexico's most-wanted man.\n\n200,000 people died in the conflict by June 2017, while another 30,000 were missing. 83,191 were killed during Felipe Calderon's administration between December 2006 and October 2012, while 23,640 died in the first 14 months of Enrique Peña Nieto's administration between December 2012 and January 2014. By the start of 2011, 1,000 children had been killed. 58 reporters also died by the start of 2010. 511 American civilians were killed in Mexico between 2006 and 2012.\n\nThe Mexican attorney general's office has claimed that 9 of 10 victims of the Mexican Drug War are members of organized-crime groups, although this figure has been questioned by other sources. Deaths among military and police personnel are an estimated 7% of the total. The states that suffer from the conflict most are Baja California, Guerrero, Chihuahua, Michoacán, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Sinaloa. President Calderón's government is currently fighting the traffickers, especially in his home state of Michoacán, but also including operations in the states of Jalisco and Guerrero, and in 2009 drug-related violence increased considerably in Sonora.\n\nBy January 2007, these various operations had extended to the states of Guerrero as well as the so-called \"Golden Triangle States\" of Chihuahua, Durango, and Sinaloa. In the following February the states of Nuevo León and Tamaulipas were included as well.\n\nSeizures and arrests have jumped since Calderón took office in December 2006, and Mexico has extradited more than 100 people wanted in the U.S.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, the Mexican government announced plans to nearly double the size of its Federal Police force to reduce the role of the military in combating drug trafficking. The plan, known as the Comprehensive Strategy Against Drug Trafficking, also involves purging local police forces of corrupt officers. Elements of the plan have already been set in motion, including a massive police recruiting and training effort intended to reduce the country's dependence in the drug war on the military.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, the Mexican Navy intercepted a 10-meter long narco-submarine travelling about 200 kilometers off the southwest of Oaxaca; in a raid, Special Forces rappelled from a helicopter onto the deck of the submarine and arrested four smugglers before they could scuttle their vessel. The vessel was found to be loaded with 5.8 tons of cocaine and was towed to Huatulco, Oaxaca, by a Mexican Navy patrol boat.\n\nOne escalation in this conflict is the traffickers' use of new means to claim their territory and spread fear. Cartel members have broadcast executions on YouTube and on other video sharing sites or shock sites, since the footage is sometimes so graphic that YouTube will not host the video. The cartels have also hung banners on streets stating their demands and/or warnings.\n\nThe 2008 Morelia grenade attacks took place on September 15, 2008, when two hand grenades were thrown onto a crowded plaza, killing ten people and injuring more than 100. Some see these efforts as intended to sap the morale of government agents assigned to crack down on the cartels; others see them as an effort to let citizens know who is winning the war. At least one dozen Mexican \"norteño\" musicians have been murdered. Most of the victims performed what are known as \"narcocorridos\", popular folk songs that tell the stories of the Mexican drug trade—and celebrate its leaders as folk heroes.\nThe extreme violence is jeopardizing foreign investment in Mexico, and the Finance Minister, Agustín Carstens, said that the deteriorating security alone is reducing gross domestic product annually by 1% in Mexico, Latin America's second-largest economy.\n\nTeachers in the Acapulco region were \"extorted, kidnapped and intimidated\" by cartels, including death threats demanding money. They went on strike in 2011.\n\nMexican cartels advance their operations, in part, by corrupting or intimidating law enforcement officials. Mexican municipal, state, and federal government officials, along with the police forces, often work together with the cartels in an organized network of corruption. A \"Pax Mafioso\", is a specific example of corruption which guarantees a politician votes and a following in exchange for turning a 'blind eye' towards a particular cartel.\n\nThe International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) reports that although the central government of Mexico has made concerted efforts to reduce corruption in recent years, it remains a serious problem. Some agents of the Federal Investigations Agency (AFI) are believed to work as enforcers for various cartels, and the Attorney General (PGR) reported in December 2005 that nearly 1,500 of AFI's 7,000 agents were under investigation for suspected criminal activity and 457 were facing charges.\nIn recent years, the federal government conducted purges and prosecution of police forces in Nuevo Laredo, Michoacán, Baja California and Mexico City. The anti-cartel operations begun by President Calderón in December 2006 includes ballistic checks of police weapons in places where there is concern that police are also working for the cartels. In June 2007, President Calderón purged 284 federal police commanders from all 31 states and the Federal District.\n\nUnder the 'Cleanup Operation' performed in 2008, several agents and high-ranking officials have been arrested and charged with selling information or protection to drug cartels; some high-profile arrests were: Victor Gerardo Garay Cadena, (chief of the Federal Police), Noé Ramírez Mandujano (ex-chief of the Organized Crime Division (SEIDO)), José Luis Santiago Vasconcelos (ex-chief of the Organized Crime Division (SEIDO)), and Ricardo Gutiérrez Vargas who is the ex-director of Mexico's Interpol office. In January 2009, Rodolfo de la Guardia García, ex-director of Mexico's Interpol office, was arrested. Julio César Godoy Toscano, who was just elected July 5, 2009 to the lower house of Congress, is charged with being a top-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana drug cartel and of protecting this cartel. He is now a fugitive.\n\nIn May 2010 an NPR report collected allegations from dozens of sources, including US and Mexican media, Mexican police officials, politicians, academics, and others, that Sinaloa Cartel had infiltrated and corrupted the Mexican federal government and the Mexican military by bribery and other means. According to a report by the U.S. Army Intelligence section in Leavenworth, over a 6-year period, of the 250,000 soldiers in the Mexican Army, 150,000 deserted and went into the drug industry.\n\nThe 2010 NPR report also stated that Sinaloa was colluding with the government to destroy other cartels and protect itself and its leader, 'Chapo'. Mexican officials denied any corruption in the government's treatment of drug cartels. Cartels had previously been reported as difficult to prosecute \"because members of the cartels have infiltrated and corrupted the law enforcement organizations that are supposed to prosecute them, such as the Office of the Attorney General.\"\n\nThe drug control policies Mexico has adopted to prevent drug trafficking and to eliminate the power of the drug cartels have adversely affected the human rights situation in the country. These policies have given the responsibilities for civilian drug control to the military, which has the power to not only carry out anti-drug and public security operations but also enact policy. According to the United States Department of State, the police and the military in Mexico were accused of committing serious human rights violations as they carried out government efforts to combat drug cartels.\n\nSome groups are especially vulnerable to human rights abuses collateral to drug law enforcement. Specifically in northern border states that have seen elevated levels of drug-related violence, human rights violations of injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers by law enforcement personnel include physical and sexual violence, extortion, and targeting for accessing or possession of injection equipment or practicing sex work, although these activities are legal. Such targeting is especially deleterious because members of these marginalized communities often lack the resources and social or political capital to vindicate their rights.\n\nImmense power in the executive branch and corruption in the legislative and judiciary branches also contribute to the worsening of Mexico's human rights situation, leading to such problems as police forces violating basic human rights through torture and threats, the autonomy of the military and its consequences and the ineffectiveness of the judiciary in upholding and preserving basic human rights. Some of the forms of human rights violations in recent years presented by human rights organizations include illegal arrests, secret and prolonged detention, torture, rape, extrajudicial execution, and fabrication of evidence.\n\nDrug policy fails to target high-level traffickers. In the 1970s, as part of the international Operation Condor, the Mexican government deployed 10,000 soldiers and police to a poverty-stricken region in northern Mexico plagued by drug production and leftist insurgency. Hundreds of peasants were arrested, tortured, and jailed, but no major drug traffickers were captured.\n\nThe emergence of internal federal agencies that are often unregulated and unaccountable also contributes to the occurrence of human rights violations. The Federal Investigations Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigación-AFI) of Mexico had been involved with numerous human rights violation cases involving torture and corruption. In one case, detainee Guillermo Velez Mendoza died while in the custody of AFI agents. The AFI agent implicated in his death was arrested but he escaped after being released on bail.\nSimilarly, nearly all AFI agents evaded punishment and arrest due to the corrupt executive and judiciary system and the supremacy of these agencies. The Attorney General's Office reported in December 2005 that one-fifth of its officers were under investigation for criminal activity, and that nearly 1,500 of AFI's 7,000 agents were under investigation for suspected criminal activity and 457 were facing charges. The AFI was finally declared a failure and was disbanded in 2009.\n\nEthnic prejudices have also emerged in the drug war, and poor and helpless indigenous communities have been targeted by the police, military, drug traffickers and the justice system. According to the National Human Rights Commission (Mexico) (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos-CNDH), nearly one-third of the indigenous prisoners in Mexico in 2001 were in prison for federal crimes, which are mostly drug-related.\n\nAnother major concern is the lack of implementation of the Leahy Law in U.S. and the consequences of that in worsening the human rights situation in Mexico. Under this U.S. law, no member or unit of a foreign security force that is credibly alleged to have committed a human rights violation may receive U.S. security training. It is alleged that the U.S., by training the military and police force in Mexico, is in violation of the Leahy Law. In this case, the U.S. embassy officials in Mexico in charge of human rights and drug control programs are blamed with aiding and abetting these violations. In December 1997, a group of heavily armed Mexican special forces soldiers kidnapped twenty young men in Ocotlan, Jalisco, brutally torturing them and killing one. Six of the implicated officers had received U.S. training as part of the Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales (GAFE) training program.\n\nAs a result of \"spillover\" along the US-bound drug trafficking routes and more stringent border enforcement, Mexico's northern border states have seen increased levels of drug consumption and abuse, including elevated rates of drug injection 10 to 15 times the national average. These rates are accompanied by mounting rates of HIV and STIs among injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers, reaching a 5.5% prevalence in cities such as Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, which also report STI rates of 64% and 83%, respectively. Violence and extortion of IDUs and sex workers directly and indirectly elevate the levels of risk behavior and poor health outcomes among members of these groups. Marginalization of these vulnerable groups by way of physical and sexual violence and extortion by police threatens the cross-over of infection from high-prevalence groups to the general population. In particular, decreased access to public health services, such as syringe exchange programs, and confiscation of syringes, even in view of syringe access and possession being legal, can precipitate a cascade of health harms. Geographic diffusion of epidemics from the northern border states elsewhere is also possible with the rotation of police and military personnel stationed in drug conflict areas with high infection prevalence.\n\nThe increase in violence related with organized crime has significantly deteriorated the conditions in which local journalism is practiced. In the first years of the 21st century, Mexico was considered the most dangerous country in the world to practice journalism, according to groups like the National Human Rights Commission, Reporters Without Borders, and the Committee to Protect Journalists. Between 2000 and 2012, several dozen journalists, including Miguel Ángel López Velasco, Luis Carlos Santiago, and Valentín Valdés Espinosa, were murdered there for covering narco-related news.\n\nOffices of Televisa and of local newspapers have been bombed. The cartels have also threatened to kill news reporters in the U.S. who have done coverage on the drug violence. Some media networks simply stopped reporting on drug crimes, while others have been infiltrated and corrupted by drug cartels. In 2011, Notiver journalist Miguel Angel Lopez Velasco and his wife and son were murdered in their home.\n\nAbout 74 percent of the journalists killed since 1992 in Mexico have been reporters for print newspapers, followed in number by Internet media and radio at about 11 percent each. Television journalism only includes 4 percent of the deaths. These numbers are not proportional to the audience size of the different mediums; most Mexican households have a television, a large majority have a radio, but only a small number have the internet, and the circulation numbers for Mexican newspapers are relatively low.\n\nSince harassment neutralized many of the traditional media outlets, anonymous blogs like Blog del Narco took on the role of reporting on events related to the drug war. The drug cartels responded by murdering bloggers and social media users. Twitter users have been tortured and killed for posting and denouncing information of the drug cartels' activities. In September 2011, user NenaDLaredo of the website Nuevo Laredo Envivo was murdered allegedly by the Zetas.\n\nIn May 2012 several journalist murders occurred in Veracruz. Regina Martinez of \"Proceso\" was murdered in Xalapa. A few days later, three Veracruz photojournalists were tortured and killed and their dismembered bodies were dumped in a canal. They had worked for various news outlets, including Notiver, Diario AZ, and TV Azteca. Human rights groups condemned the murders and demanded the authorities investigate the crimes.\n\nSince the start of the Mexican Drug War in 2006, the drug trafficking organizations have slaughtered their rivals, killed policemen, and now increasingly targeted politicians – especially local leaders. Most of the places where these politicians have been killed are areas plagued by drug-related violence. Part of the strategy used by the criminal groups behind the killings of local figures is the weakening of the local governments. For example, María Santos Gorrostieta Salazar, the former mayor of a town in western Mexico, who had survived three earlier assassination attempts and the murder of her husband, was abducted and beaten to death in November 2012. Extreme violence puts politicians at the mercy of the mafias, thus allowing the cartels to take control of the fundamental government structures and expand their criminal agendas.\n\nIn addition, because mayors usually appoint local police chiefs, they are seen by the cartels as key assets in their criminal activities to control the police forces in their areas of influence. The cartels also seek to control the local governments to win government contracts and concessions; these \"public works\" help them ingrain themselves in the community and gain the loyalty and respect of the communities in which they operate. Politicians are usually targeted for three reasons: (1) Political figures who are honest pose a direct threat to organized crime, and are consequently killed by the cartels; (2) Politicians make arrangements to protect a certain cartel and are killed by a rival cartel; and (3) a cartel simply kills politicians to heat up the turf of the rival cartel that operates in the area.\n\nThe cartels engage in kidnapping, ransom, murder, robbery, and extortion of migrants traveling from Central America through Mexico on their way to \"El Norte\" (the United States and Canada). Sometimes the cartels force the migrants to join their organization and work for them. Mass graves have been also discovered in Mexico containing bodies of migrants. In 2011, 177 bodies were discovered in a mass grave in Tamaulipas, the same area where the bodies of 72 migrants were discovered in 2010. In a case in San Fernando, Mexico, most of the dead had \"died of blunt force trauma to the head.\"\n\nThe cartels have also infiltrated the Mexican government's immigration agencies, and attacked and threatened immigration officers. The National Human Rights Commission of Mexico (Comisión Nacional de los Derechos Humanos, CNDH) said that 11,000 migrants had been kidnapped in 6 months in 2010 by drug cartels.\n\nThere are documented links between the drug cartels and human trafficking for forced labor, forced prostitution, and rape. A wife of a narco described a system in which young girls became prostitutes and then were forced to work in drug factories. Circa 2011, Los Zetas reportedly began to move into the prostitution business (including the prostitution of children) after previously being only 'suppliers' of women to already existing networks.\n\nThe U.S. State Department says that the practice of forced labor in Mexico is larger in extent than forced prostitution. Mexican journalists like Lydia Cacho have been threatened, beaten, raped, and forced into exile for reporting on these facts.\n\nImproved cooperation of Mexico with the U.S. led to the recent arrests of 755 Sinaloa cartel suspects in U.S. cities and towns, but the U.S. market is being eclipsed by booming demand for cocaine in Europe, where users now pay twice the going U.S. rate. U.S. Attorney General announced September 17, 2008 that an international drug interdiction operation, Project Reckoning, involving law enforcement in the United States, Italy, Canada, Mexico and Guatemala had netted more than 500 organized crime members involved in the cocaine trade. The announcement highlighted the Italian-Mexican cocaine connection.\n\nIn December 2011 the government of Spain remarked that Mexican cartels have multiplied their operations in that country, becoming the main entry point of cocaine into Europe.\n\nIn 2012 it was reported that Mexican drug cartels had joined forces with the Sicilian Mafia, when Italian officials unearthed information that Palermo’s black market, along with other Italian ports, was being used by Mexico's drug cartels as a conduit to bring drugs to the European market, in which they had been trafficking drugs, particularly cocaine, throughout the Atlantic Ocean for over 10 years to Europe.\n\nThe Mexican Army crackdown has driven some cartels to seek a safer location for their operations across the border in Guatemala, attracted by corruption, weak policing and its position on the overland smuggling route. The smugglers pick up drugs from small planes that land at private airstrips hidden in the Guatemalan jungle. The cargo is then moved up through Mexico to the U.S. border. Guatemala has also arrested dozens of drug suspects and torched huge cannabis and poppy fields. The U.S. government sent speedboats and night-vision goggles under a regional drug aid package.\n\nIn February 2009, Los Zetas threatened to kill the president of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom. On March 1, 2010, Guatemala's chief of national police and the country's top anti-drugs official was arrested over alleged links to drug trafficking. A report from the Brookings Institution warns that, without proactive, timely efforts, the violence will spread throughout the Central American region.\n\nAccording to the United States government, Los Zetas control 75% of Guatemala through violence, political corruption and infiltration in the country's institutions. Sources mentioned that Los Zetas gained ground in Guatemala after they killed several high-profile members and the supreme leader of \"Los Leones\", an organized crime group from Guatemala.\n\nAt least nine Mexican and Colombian drug cartels have established bases in 11 West African nations. They are reportedly working closely with local criminal gangs to carve out a staging area for access to the lucrative European market. The Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that it is much easier to smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to Europe – mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. Higher demand for cocaine in Western Europe in addition to North American interdiction campaigns has led to dramatically increased trafficking in the region: nearly 50% of all non-U.S. bound cocaine, or about 13% of all global flows, is now smuggled through West Africa.\n\nThe Mexican Army has severely curtailed the ability of the Mexican drug cartels to move cocaine inside the U.S. and Canada, prompting an upsurge in gang violence in Vancouver, where the cocaine price has increased from $23,300 to almost $39,000 per kilo as both the U.S. and Canadian drug markets are experiencing prolonged shortages of cocaine. As evidence of this pressure, the U.S. government says the amount of cocaine seized on U.S. soil dropped by 41 percent between early 2007 and mid-2008. Since 2009 Vancouver, British Columbia became the main Mexican drug cartels' center of operations in Canada.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department considers the Mexican drug cartels to be the \"greatest organized crime threat to the United States.\" During the first 18 months of Calderón's presidency, the Mexican government has spent about US$7 billion in the war against drugs. In seeking partnership from the United States, Mexican officials point out that the illicit drug trade is a shared problem in need of a shared solution, and remark that most of the financing for the Mexican traffickers comes from American drug consumers. On March 25, 2009, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that \"[America's] insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade\", and that \"the United States bears shared responsibility for the drug-fueled violence sweeping Mexico.\"\n\nU.S. State Department officials knew that Mexican ex-president Felipe Calderón's willingness to work with the United States was unprecedented on issues of security, crime and drugs, so the U.S. Congress passed legislation in late June 2008 to provide Mexico and Central American countries with US$1.6 billion for the Mérida Initiative, a three-year international assistance plan. The Mérida Initiative provides Mexico and Central American countries with law enforcement training and equipment, as well as technical advice to strengthen the national justice systems. The Mérida Initiative does not include cash or weapons.\n\nCurrently, the Mexican drug cartels already have a presence in most major U.S. cities. In 2009, the Justice Department reported that Mexican drug cartels distribute drugs in nearly 200 cities across the United States, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. Gang-related activity and violence has increased along the U.S. Southwest border region, as US-based gangs act as enforcers for Mexican drug cartels.\n\nU.S. authorities are reporting a spike in killings, kidnappings and home invasions connected to Mexico's cartels, and at least 19 Americans were killed in 2008. Another 92 Americans were killed between June 2009 and June 2010.\n\nThe U.S. Joint Forces Command noted in a December 2008 report that in terms of worst-case scenarios, Mexico bears some consideration for sudden collapse in the next two decades as the government, its politicians, police, and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels. The Joint Forces Command is concerned that this internal conflict will have a major impact on the stability of the Mexican state over the next several years, and therefore would demand an American response based on the implications for homeland security alone. After the JFC broached this sensitive issue in its 2008 report, several journalists and academics subsequently discussed in print the possibility that Mexico could become a failed state.\n\nThe Mexican government was rather irritated with the U.S. government for raising the prospect of Mexico becoming a failed state. In a February 2009 interview with the Associated Press, President Calderon said it was \"absolutely false\" to label his country a failed state. To smooth over relations with Mexico over this issue, Secretary Clinton personally visited Mexico City in March 2009, followed by a visit by President Obama a month later.\n\nMeanwhile, in March 2009, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said that it was considering using the National Guard to counter the threat of drug violence in Mexico from spreading to the U.S. The governors of Arizona and Texas have asked the federal government to send additional National Guard troops to help those already there supporting local law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking. Calls for National Guard deployment on the border greatly increased after the 2010 murder of Arizona rancher Robert Krentz, possibly at the hands of Mexican drug smugglers.\n\nIn March 2009, the Obama administration outlined plans to redeploy more than 500 federal agents to border posts and redirect $200 million to combat smuggling of illegal drugs, money and weapons. On May 25, 2010 President Obama authorized deployment of 1,200 National Guard troops to the U.S. border with Mexico to assist with border protection and enforcement activities, as well as help train additional Customs and Border Protection agents. However, as the Washington Office on Latin America has pointed out, in spite of fears that violence in Mexico would spill over the border into the United States, the U.S. southwest border region has remained calm and, in fact, is currently experiencing homicide rates lower than national averages.\n\nVicente Zambada Niebla, a member of the Sinaloa cartel and son of Ismael Zambada García, one of the top drug lords in Mexico, claimed after his arrest to his attorneys that he and other top Sinaloa cartel members had received immunity by U.S. agents and a virtual licence to smuggle cocaine over the United States border, in exchange for intelligence about rival cartels engaged in the Mexican Drug War.\n\nIn October 2013, two former federal agents and an ex-CIA contractor told an American television network that CIA operatives were involved in the kidnapping and murder of DEA covert agent Enrique Camarena, because he was a threat to the agency's drug operations in Mexico. According to the three men, the CIA was collaborating with drug traffickers moving cocaine and marijuana to the United States, and using its share of the profits to finance Nicaraguan Contra rebels attempting to overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government. A CIA spokesman responded, calling it \"ridiculous\" to suggest that the Agency had anything to do with the murder of a US federal agent or the escape of his alleged killer.\n\nAccording to former Presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico and César Gaviria of Colombia, the United States-led drug war is pushing Latin America into a downward spiral; Mr. Cardoso said in a conference that \"the available evidence indicates that the war on drugs is a failed war\". The panel of the Latin American Commission on Drugs and Democracy commission, headed by Cardoso, stated that the countries involved in this war should remove the \"taboos\" and re-examine the anti-drug programs. Latin American governments have followed the advice of the U.S. to combat the drug war, but the policies had little effect. The commission made some recommendations to United States President Barack Obama to consider new policies, such as decriminalization of marijuana and to treat drug use as a public health problem and not as a security problem. The Council on Hemispheric Affairs states it is time to seriously consider drug decriminalization and legalization, a policy initiative that would be in direct opposition to the interests of criminal gangs.\n\nDespite the fact that Mexican drug cartels and their Colombian suppliers generate, launder and remove $18 billion to $39 billion from the United States each year, the U.S. and Mexican governments have been criticized for their unwillingness or slow response to confront the various cartels' financial operations, including money laundering.\n\nThe U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has identified the need to increase financial investigations relating to the movement of illegal drug funds to Mexico. The DEA states that attacking the financial infrastructure of drug cartels has to play a key role in any viable drug enforcement strategy. The U.S. DEA has noted that the U.S. and Mexican financial services industry continues to be a facilitator for drug money movement.\n\nFollowing suit, in August 2010 President Felipe Calderón proposed sweeping new measures to crack down on the cash smuggling and money laundering. Calderón proposes a ban on cash purchases of real estate and of certain luxury goods that cost more than 100,000 pesos (about US$8,104.) His package would also require more businesses to report large transactions, such as real estate, jewelry and purchases of armor plating. In June 2010, Calderón \"announced strict limits on the amount in U.S. dollars that can be deposited or exchanged in banks\", but the proposed restrictions to financial institutions are facing tough opposition in the Mexican legislature.\n\nIn 2011, Wachovia, at one time a major U.S. bank, was implicated in laundering money for Mexican drug lords. In a settlement, Wachovia paid federal authorities $110 million in forfeiture. A US Senate report from the permanent subcommittee for investigations revealed in July 2012 that HSBC – one of Europe's biggest banks- moved $7 billion in bulk cash from Mexico to the US, most of it suspected to assist Mexican drug lords and US drug cartels in moving money to the US. While money laundering problems at HSBC have been flagged by regulators for nearly a decade, the bank continued to avoid compliance. On December 12, 2012, HSBC settled for a $1.93 billion fine.\n\nRAND studies released in the mid-1990s found that using drug user treatment to reduce drug consumption in the United States is seven times more cost effective than law enforcement efforts alone, and it could potentially cut consumption by a third.\n\nIn FY2011, the Obama Administration requests approximately $5.6 billion to support demand reduction. This includes a 13% increase for prevention and almost a 4% increase for treatment. The overall FY 2011 counter-drug request for supply reduction and domestic law enforcement is $15.5 billion with $521.1 million in new funding.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n\n"}

Founded by DJ, promoter and musician Jonny Slut in 2002, it ran for six years. The night is commonly associated with the ambisexual post-electroclash scene.\n\nThe Independent described the night as a \"legendary electro midweeker\" famous for its blend of subcultures and musical styles. It was held every Wednesday night from 2002 to 2008. In 2003, The Independent wrote that \"it's the sort of place where students mix with celebs, where you wait your turn behind Kate Moss for the make-up mirror, and where the presence of Boy George, checking out Pink Grease last week, didn't even merit a double take.\"\n\nPopular among London's celebrities, stars such as Kate Moss, Alexander McQueen, Björk, Keith Flint, Gwen Stefani, Cilla Black, Zoë Ball and regular Boy George were documented partying there , and acts such as Ellen Allien, Vitalic, Miss Kittin and My Toys Like Me performed.\n\nJonny Slut told \"The Guardian\" in 2005 that \"one reason I started the night was that music was becoming more interesting again. It might not entertain 4,000 people at Ministry of Sound, but it certainly entertains my crowd. Anyone who thinks club culture is dead should come and see my queue on Wednesday nights.\" \n\nThe club's name is derived from the song \"Nag Nag Nag\" by 1970s industrial band Cabaret Voltaire. The track is included on a double CD compilation of music that was played at the club, compiled by Jonny Slut, released in 2003.\n\nNag Nag Nag closed in May 2008.\n\nJonny Slut and another of the club's DJs, Fil OK, released music on their own label called NagNagNag under the name Atomizer. Their debut single was co-produced by The KLF's Jimmy Cauty.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "822311", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=822311", "title": "Parentalia", "text": "Parentalia\n\nIn ancient Rome, the Parentalia () or dies parentales (, \"ancestral days\") was a nine-day festival held in honor of family ancestors, beginning on 13 February.\n\nAlthough the Parentalia was a holiday on the Roman religious calendar, its observances were mainly domestic and familial. The importance of the family to the Roman state, however, was expressed by public ceremonies on the opening day, the Ides of February, when a Vestal conducted a rite for the collective \"di parentes\" of Rome at the tomb of Tarpeia.\n\nOvid describes sacred offerings (\"sacrificia\") of flower-garlands, wheat, salt, wine-soaked bread and violets to the \"shades of the dead\" (\"Manes\" or \"Di manes\") at family tombs, which were located outside Rome's sacred boundary \"(pomerium)\". These observances were meant to strengthen the mutual obligations and protective ties between the living and the dead, and were a lawful duty of the \"paterfamilias\" (head of the family). Parentalia concluded on 21 February in the midnight rites of Feralia, when the \"paterfamilias\" addressed the malevolent, destructive aspects of his Manes.\n\nFeralia was a placation and exorcism: Ovid thought it a more rustic, primitive and ancient affair than the Parentalia itself. It appears to have functioned as a cleansing ritual for Caristia on the following day, when the family held an informal banquet to celebrate the amity between themselves and their benevolent ancestral dead (\"Lares\"). The emphasis on collective cult for the Manes and early \"di parentes\" implies their afterlife as vague and lacking individuation. In later cult they are vested with personal qualities, and in Imperial cult, they acquire divine \"numen\" and become \"divi\", divine entities. \n\nFrom Parentalia to Caristia all temples were closed, marriages were forbidden, and \"magistrates appeared without their insignia,\" an indication that no official business was conducted. William Warde Fowler describes the Parentalia as \"practically a yearly renewal of the rite of burial\".\n\nIndividuals might also commemorated on their birthday \"(dies natalis)\". Some would be commemorated throughout the year on marked days of the month, such as the Kalends, Nones or Ides, when lamps might be lit at the tomb. The Lemuria on 9, 11 and 13 May was aimed at appeasing \"kinless and hungry\" spirits of the dead.\n\n"}
{"id": "2991837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2991837", "title": "Pong Su incident", "text": "Pong Su incident\n\nThe \"Pong Su\" incident began on 16 April 2003 when heroin was smuggled from the \"Pong Su\", a North Korean cargo ship, onto an Australian beach. Australian military special forces subsequently boarded the \"Pong Su\" in Australian territorial waters four days later. The ship was suspected of being involved in smuggling almost of heroin into Australia with an estimated street value of A$160 million.\n\nThe \"Pong Su\" (봉수호) was a 349-foot (106 m), 3,743-tonne North Korean-owned ocean freighter registered in Tuvalu, a flag of convenience. Three men arrested on shore were convicted of importing heroin; a fourth man from the ship who landed the heroin and was arrested on shore pleaded guilty; the crew were all acquitted and deported; and after being confiscated the ship was destroyed in 2006.\n\n\"Operation Sorbet\" was an Australian police international trafficking operation that had been conducting surveillance on two persons who had entered Australia in March 2003 from China and a third person on 9 April from China on tourist visas.\n\nOn the night of the 15 April 2003, Australian Federal Police (AFP) conducted surveillance on two persons who rendezvoused with the \"Pong Su\" close to shore at Boggaley Creek near the seaside town of Wye River in Victoria and followed them to a nearby hotel. The next morning, the two suspects were apprehended with two packages containing of pure heroin after leaving the hotel. A third suspect was also arrested later that day in nearby Geelong.\n\nThe following day, in a search of the beach at Boggaley Creek, police discovered the body of a man of East Asian appearance covered by seaweed close to a dinghy who had been part of a two man landing party from the \"Pong Su\". The deceased man has never been identified. The dinghy had suffered fuel problems in the surf and had capsized landing the heroin and drowning one of the crew. Victoria Police apprehended the second man from the landing party in the immediate area the same day. He had been unable to get back to his boat and simply remained in the area where the drugs came ashore the night before. The AFP stated that they had been working on Operation Sorbet for several months including with international peers. A further of heroin in three packages was later discovered buried near Wye River in May 2003 after subsequent searches following coordinates from a seized GPS device. An additional, package of heroin had been lost during the landing.\n\nOn the morning of the 17 April, a Tasmania Police patrol vessel directed the \"Pong Su\" to head for Melbourne after it had travelled east entering the Bass Strait. In the afternoon, the \"Pong Su\" advised that it would head for Sydney and was directed to head for Eden. New South Wales Police patrol vessels became involved. In the morning of the 18 April, the \"Pong Su\" changed direction to the east away from Australia towards international waters at speed with a police vessel having to terminate the pursuit due to rough weather. in the evening, Navy warship HMAS \"Stuart\" began tracking the \"Pong Su\". In the morning of the 20 April, after a four-day chase, \"Stuart\" intercepted the \"Pong Su\" south east of Newcastle with the \"Pong Su\" complying with most directions. Army Special Operations Tactical Assault Group (TAG) operators boarded by simultaneously fast roping onto the deck from a Seahawk helicopter and from climbing the side onto the deck from three rigid hull inflatable boats (RHIBs) with the crew compliant. The \"Pong Su\" was secured and brought into port in Sydney. Searches of the ship by Australian authorities revealed it had been modified for long voyages and was carrying enough fuel and provisions to travel around the world without needing to enter a port.\n\nSome 30 men were arrested and detained. It was alleged that the North Korean government was involved in the manufacture and trade of the drugs. The North Korean government stated the ship was a \"civilian trading ship\" and the ship's owner had no knowledge of the illegal cargo.\n\nThe three men arrested on shore pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the importation of a commercial quantity of heroin. They were sentenced to between 22 and 24 years imprisonment. They were apparently not of North Korean origin (but from Malaysia and Singapore) and not part of the ship's crew. The fourth man from the landing party, who was a Chinese national, pleaded guilty to importing a commercial quantity of heroin.\n\nThe captain and crew of the \"Pong Su\" were charged with narcotics trafficking. Most significantly, an official of the governing Korean Workers' Party was found on board, linking the drug shipment to Kim Jong-il's government. According to Australian media reports, he had served as senior envoy in North Korea's embassy in China. The Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer called in the North Korean Ambassador to lodge a formal protest.\n\nDrug charges were laid against the ship's entire crew. 27 crew members were discharged on 5 March 2004 by a magistrate on the basis that there was insufficient evidence for them to stand trial. While awaiting deportation, the crew were held in Baxter Detention Centre; during which time they were questioned by federal authorities. They were deported from Australia on 24 June 2004.\n\nFour senior crew members were kept in Australia to face a jury trial:\nAll four crew members pleaded not guilty at the beginning of their trial in August 2005.\n\nThe prosecution case against the four North Korean officers was that they would not have allowed their ship to be stopped in the position it was if they were not aware that the real purpose of their voyage was to smuggle the heroin. The prosecution did not allege any official involvement of the North Korean government, only the officers on board the ship.\n\nOn 2 March 2004, the United States Department of State released a report using the incident to link Kim Jong-il's government to drugs trafficking.\n\nOn 5 March 2006, a Supreme Court of Victoria jury found the ship's four officers not guilty on all charges. They were subsequently deported.\n\nAfter capture the ship was brought to Sydney Harbour where it was originally moored at Garden Island naval base. From there it was taken to Snails Bay and moored for over two years, where it was reportedly costing over $2,500 a day for maintenance and security. It was taken to Chowder Bay in early 2006 while authorities decided what to do with it.\n\nAuthorities eventually decided to scuttle the ship. On 23 March 2006, in a joint Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) and Royal Australian Navy military exercise, the \"Pong Su\" was sunk by two GBU-10 Paveway II laser-guided bombs dropped from RAAF General Dynamics F-111C aircraft. The deliberate destruction of the freighter was said to deliver a strong message to international drug smuggling rings that the Australian Federal Police and Commonwealth Government would take all measures necessary to stop illegal drug importation.\n\nBefore the ship was scuttled, its radio was removed and donated to a museum.\n\n\n\n"}

The tour began on May 7, 2014, in Belfast, Northern Ireland at the Odyssey Arena, concluding on October 18, 2015, in Alajuela, Costa Rica at Parque Viva after six legs. The Prismatic World Tour grossed more than $204.3 million from 149 shows with a total attendance of 1,984,503 between 2014 and 2015 and it is Perry's most successful tour to date.\n\nPerry first teased the tour during her \"We Can Survive\" event at the Hollywood Bowl on October 23, 2013, where she encouraged fans to see her on her 2014 tour, stating that it would be \"magical\". She told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that \"The tour is going to be fantastic. I always try to take it to the next level. I think people will realize what the tour is going to be like when they listen to the music.\" She also emphasized that she would be \"very close\" to the audience during the tour. At the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, Perry said the show would be \"less cartoony\" than the California Dreams Tour and would be a \"feast for your eyes\". Perry told Capital FM in December 2013 that the tour has a less of a storyline than her previous endeavors, saying:\n\nI'm going to bring all the bells and whistles like it was last time but it won't be so highly narrated. I just want a little bit more room to express myself... I'm just really excited. I just did a big tour meeting yesterday and saw the graphic drawing of the stage and it's unlike anything I've seen for any other artist and it's unlike anything I've ever done. It's different, it's fresh, it's clean and it's actually in the middle of the audience.\nOver 275 costumes were designed for the tour, including 80 for the dancers. Perry gave designer Marina Toybina intricate details for each outfit's materials, patterns, and designs. According to Toybina, \"[Perry's] creative involvement was daily, down to us deciding together on trims, final prints, specific materials and color spectrum for any and all digital artwork\".\nPerry announced the tour on November 18, 2013, via Twitter. She announced the first leg taking place in Northern Ireland, Scotland, and England along with Icona Pop as the opening act. According to the official press release, the tour is designed to be a \"multi-faceted spectacular\" and will include a special standing pit around the stage called \"The Reflection Section\" that will allow Perry to be \"closer than ever to her fans.\" The first leg took place in May 2014. The second leg was announced on January 15, 2014, consisting of concerts in Canada, United States and Mexico. The leg ran from June to October 2014. Ferras opened for Perry in all of the North American dates with the exception of Mexico. Capital Cities opened from June 22, 2014 through August 8, 2014, Kacey Musgraves opened from August 10, 2014 through September 10, 2014, duo Tegan and Sara opened from September 12, 2014 through October 8, 2014, and Becky G opened from October 10 through 18, 2014.

Tinashe served as the opening act in Curitiba, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Bogotá, San Juan, Panama City, and Alajuela. Other opening acts included Gala Brie in Lima, AlunaGeorge in São Paulo, Lali in Buenos Aires, and Durazno in Bogotá. On February 16, 2015, Rock in Rio announced Perry as a main headliner of the festival in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nMultiple outfits and costumes are featured throughout the tour. Her first costume, which is worn during the \"Prismatic\" act, is a silver, mirrored leather skirt, complete with finger less gloves and matching heels. The neckline, waistline, arms and bottom of the skirt all are installed with lights that glow during the performance. Perry also has light up extensions to match her dress for this section. During the \"Egyptian\" act, Perry wears a hand-embroidered purple leotard, a hand-embellished collar and an ornate purple and gold skirt, complete with thigh high purple high heel boots. She also wears a blonde wig with black bangs and ends. The \"Cat-oure\" act has Perry wearing a sparkly, pink, leopard leotard, complete with a tail and a matching pink plastic hat with cat ears and a short black bobbed wig attached to it. The chest and abdomen of the costume are nude colored, and the costume also contains a shimmery belt and collar. For the \"Acoustic\" act, Perry wears a butterfly inspired dress, a long with a short, silver glittery cape. The dress had a butterfly over the chest, and the bottom of the dress is see through, also containing butterflies imprinted on it. She also adorns a multi-colored wig, featuring pastel blues, pinks and greens.The \"Throwback\" act has Perry emerge on stage wearing a yellow smiley face push up bra, leggings with yellow piece signs on them, as well as a yellow skirt. For \"It Takes Two\", Perry wears a Yin-Yang crop top over her smiley face bra, and a large Yin-Yang dress that inflates as she rises on the stage. Following \"It Takes Two\", the Yin-Yang costume is removed and Perry now wears a yellow leather jacket with a smiley face on the back and sunglasses. The \"Hyper Neon\" act follows, where Perry wears a green palm tree inspired bra, high waisted underwear containing palm tree decor around it and pink heels with thigh high socks on. After exiting and returning to perform \"Birthday\", Perry emerges wearing a full body, skin-colored leotard. The leotard features many birthday themed items on it, such as balloons over the breasts, a cake over her pubic region, a bow on the buttocks, confetti and glitter everywhere, as well as 'Happy Birthday' embroidered on the back of it. During the entire \"Hyper Neon\" act, Perry wears a green ombre wig, that is dark towards the top, and transitions into a more lime green towards the tip. The wig is also pulled down into small buns. For the \"Encore\", Perry emerges with a long black wig, and a firework inspired dress. The corset and pants and heels are both glittery blue, and the corset features fireworks over the breasts. Perry adorns elbow length blue gloves with fireworks on them. She also wears a dress that straps onto the corset and reveals the front of her body. The dress is orange and features many different fireworks around it.\n\nOn May 14, 2014, at LG Arena in Birmingham, England, the Eyptian-inspired Lavender bodysuit and thigh-high boots were replaced with a Red bodysuit & Gladiator sandals during the \"Ancient Egyptian\" Section of the show. \n\nFor the Asian Leg of the tour, Perry adorned several new costumes. For the \"Prismatic\" Act, she wore a metallic, purple cat inspired leotard. The outfit contained metallic, purple thigh high hell boots, a leotard complete with a cat face, with glowing eyes, and little multi-color triangles around the leotard that lit up, similar to her previous outfit. For the \"Acoustic\" set, Perry now wears a sparkly green dress, that has sunflowers over the breasts, and on other parts of the dress. The wig she adorns is also more vibrant in color, and less pastel. For her shows in China, during the \"Throwback\" and \"Hyper Neon\" act, Perry wore a pastel splatter paint inspired mini dress, which was a dress to look as if it had been splattered with paint. After her shows and China, Perry debuted (on tour) a new outfit to replace the splatter paint dress during the same act. This outfit consisted of a leather pink striped crop top bra, which had yellow shoulder pads sticking off of it. She wore leather pink striped cufflets and a pink, yellow and orange striped mini dress, created to look as if it was over lapping on itself – she wore this outfit when performing at the BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend.\n\nThe show begins with neon-clad dancers emerging on stage. An area of the stage moves to form a pyramid, from which Perry emerges to perform \"Roar\", wearing a mirrored leather skirt and crop top with neon lights woven into the seams. Towards the end of the song, she and the dancers skip using light-up ropes while the entire arena goes dark. \"Part of Me\" is the next track to be performed, where she and her dancers sprint down a 15 meter long treadmill. Following Part of Me, a dubstep version of \"Wide Awake\", during which a triangular section of the stage rises and rotates in the air. She then performs \"This Moment\", which features multi colored lasers projected across the stage. This Moment shortly transforms into \"Love Me\" afterwards, followed by Perry exiting the stage.. After a video interlude displaying Perry's face created out of stars and planets in space, she appears on stage atop a mechanical horse. During this section of the tour, she wears an Egyptian-themed outfit, completed with a hand-embroidered leotard, a hand-embellished collar and an ornate purple and gold skirt. Perry performs \"Dark Horse\", before moving on to \"E.T.\". A large diamond-shaped structure descends from the ceiling to lift the singer in the air. \"Legendary Lovers\" is then performed, followed by \"I Kissed a Girl\", which features dancers dressed as Rubenesque mummies with large breasts and buttocks. They follow Perry around the stage and after she exits, the mummies proceed with their own dance while guitarists are lifted into the air, with sparks shooting from their guitars.\nA video interlude shows a cat being transported from the Pyramids of Giza to \"Kittywood\". Perry emerges on top of a large ball of wool wearing a catsuit, accompanied by her dancers wearing similar cat costumes. A jazz version of \"Hot n Cold\" is then performed, before Perry begins to perform \"International Smile\"; the song is intermingled with Madonna's \"Vogue\". The dancers enact a short scene in which the cats chase a mouse. Perry re-enters, wearing a butterfly-themed dress and cape and performs multiple songs acoustically, including \"By the Grace of God\", a mash-up of \"The One That Got Away\" and \"Thinking of You\", and \"Unconditionally\".\n\nAt the beginning of this section, there is a \"Megamix Dance Party\", performed by the dancers and backing singers, which is a mix of a selection of songs. Perry arrives on stage wearing a top, skirt, and leggings featuring smiling faces and peace symbols. She performs \"Walking on Air\", where she is lifted above the stage and flies from on end to the other. Following this, she changes into a yin-yang dress to sing \"It Takes Two\". While performing the song, she is lifted off the ground while the bottom half of her dress is inflated and covers the lift, to give the apprentice of her being very tall. To close this section of the tour, a mash-up of \"This Is How We Do\" and \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" is performed as Perry and her dancers ride an inflatable car on stage. A video interlude is played, which shows Perry as a mental patient in a triangular padded cell, before paint splashes from all areas of the room. She appears on stage wearing a bra and skirt decorated with palm leaves to perform \"Teenage Dream\". \"California Gurls\" is then performed with blackout lights and dancers move letters that eventually recreate the Hollywood Sign. Perry exits the stage before re-emerging to sing \"Birthday\", wearing a one-piece outfit named the \"Birthday Suit\", decorated with balloons over her breasts, and other birthday themed items. During the performance, Perry brings a member of the audience whose birthday is near the show's date on stage, and they sit on a throne on top of a rotating birthday cake, which emerges from the stage. She soon is trapped into a seat with multiple balloons attached to it and flies around the entire audience as balloons and confetti descend from above. Soon after, she exits the stage once more after thanking everyone for attending and introducing her band members.\n\nFor the encore, an interlude called \"Prism-Vision\" is played, where the audience are encouraged to wear special rainbow-star diffraction glasses picked up before the show to magnify the visual effects of the performance. Perry enters the stage wearing a firework-themed dress to perform \"Firework\". During the song's climax, multiple fireworks explode on stage before Perry ends the show, exiting through the pyramid from which she entered the stage at the beginning.\n\nThe first leg attracted high public demand, resulting in additional shows in Belfast, Glasgow, and London being announced within hours of tickets being released on general sale. Soon after, Perry added extra dates in Manchester and Birmingham. Extra dates in the United States, Canada and Mexico were also added to the second leg of her tour shortly after the leg's first announcement. Due to vast popularity during the pre-sale period, Perry added more shows to the Oceania leg in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, extending the leg to December. Jesse Lawrence from \"Forbes\" reported on the North American leg of the tour, saying that her ticket sales averaged at $252.60 on the secondary market throughout the five-month stint in the country. His analysis concluded that the average price was higher than that of her peers, such as Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, adding \"with Prismatic holding one of the highest tour average prices of the summer, the secondary market won't have many dates dropping below a $200 average price.\"\n\nOn Pollstar's Mid Year Top 100 Worldwide Tours list, released in July 2014 and ranking tours up until that date, the Prismatic World Tour ranked at number 26 with $22 million in grosses and 249,716 tickets sold for 22 shows so far. The Prismatic World Tour topped the \"Billboard\" Hot Tours weekly recap the week of September 18. The tour topped the chart with $31 million in ticket sales from 21 of the tour's North American concerts that occurred in a two-month span beginning on July 15. In Australia, the tour sold more than 350,000 tickets across 23 dates. It broke the record for most tickets sold at the Allphones Arena, selling a total of 89,500 tickets spanning six shows. Paul Dainty of Dainty Group, the promoters of the Australian leg, stated that ticket demand was so high \"we could have added another dozen shows everywhere easily.\"\n\nThe Prismatic World Tour was an international success and became Perry's most successful tour to date. The tour was the second highest-grossing, and highest-grossing led by a female, in North America by average box office gross per city in 2014. According to \"Pollstar\", the tour was the fourth best-selling in the world, and the best-selling by a solo female, in 2014 with a gross of $153 million and 1,407,972 attendees. The tour was highly successful in North America, becoming the 25th best-selling North American tour of all-time with sales of $94.3 million, making it the third best-selling tour in North America of 2014. The tour was also highly successful in Australia, selling 350,000 tickets across the country and breaking Allphones Arena's attendance record with over 89,000 tickets sold at Allphones Arena alone. The tour's success continued into 2015. The \"Pollstar\" 2015 Mid-Year Top 100 Worldwide Tour list revealed the Prismatic World Tour as the 23rd highest grosser, with a total of $25.8 million from 35 shows, and a total of 373,133 in attendance. However, \"Pollstar\" later adjusted its Mid-Year report, stating that the Prismatic World Tour grossed $35.7 million from 35 international dates in the first half of 2015 instead of $25.8 million. In the other hand, one week later, \"Billboard\" reported that the Prismatic World Tour grossed over $41.7 million from 27 shows in the first half of 2015. At the end of 2015, the tour placed 27th on Pollstar's \"Top 100 Worldwide Tours\", grossing $51 million from 43 dates.\n\nPerry's performances at Melbourne's Rod Laver Arena ranked at number 11 on Pollstar's 2014 Top Year End International Boxoffice list. At the 2014 \"Billboard\" Touring Awards, the tour won the award for \"Top Package\" and was nominated for the \"Concert Marketing & Promotion\" award. Perry was the seventh most-searched artist on Ticketmaster in 2014.\n\nThe tour has been well received by critics. Colin Stutz of \"Billboard\" called the performance in Belfast a \"spectacle of costumes and colors\". Julian Douglas from \"The Irish Times\" wrote that Perry \"entertained, thrilled, and serenaded\" and \"oozed professionalism\" despite feeling \"under the weather\". Emilee Lindner from MTV News felt Perry lived up to her previous \"promise\" of making the concert a \"feast for your eyes and for your Instagram\", and noted a recurring cat-theme within the show. Mike Wass from Idolator praised the show's costumes and dubbed the show a \"candy-colored visual extravaganza\". In a review of the one of the Glasgow shows, Matthew Magee from \"The Daily Telegraph\" awarded the tour four out of five stars, stating that Perry \"made the kind of natural connection with her Glasgow audience that her peers would die for.\" Richard Clayton of \"Financial Times\" gave the show an excellent review, awarding five out of five stars, and described it as \"sonically stonking, visually spectacular and fun, fun, fun.\" Daisy Wyatt from \"The Independent\" criticized Perry's vocal ability and stage presence. She awarded the tour three out of five stars. \"Rolling Stone\" reviewer Mark Sutherland praised the tour, calling it \"loud, garish, camp and never less than uproariously entertaining\" and \"a show to damage retinas and blow minds.\"\n\nJem Aswad of \"The Village Voice\" described the show at Madison Square Garden as \"Better Than: Every other multimillion-dollar concert I've seen\" and commented that \"The Prismatic tour, for all its expense and atom-splitting technology, is above all else fun, smart and crowd-pleasing, and I'll take that over the self-serious bombast that usually accompanies shows of this scale any day of the week.\" Nate Chinen of \"The New York Times\" gave the same show a mixed review, saying that he felt the \"music was subordinate to the spectacle\", though described it as a \"Spectacle of Pop Idol Proportions\". Pitchfork Media's Lindsay Zoladz commented on one of the shows at New York City's Barclays Center: \"I felt about this concert the way I feel about Katy Perry overall: She throws everything she's got at the wall, and every so often hits a bullseye.\" Three journalists from Pitchfork gave the show a mixed review. Jason Lipshutz of \"Billboard\" reviewed the same show positively, saying \"the superstar is at the top of her game, and Prismatic's Brooklyn debut shone bright.\" August Brown from the \"Los Angeles Times\" gave the tour a generally positive review, commenting that the \"show at the Honda Center proved that Perry's persona is a lasting one\", but \"the few stumbles came in the presentation.\" Consequence of Sound's Michael Roffman named Perry one of the Top Live Acts of 2014, saying that with the Prismatic World Tour, \"similar to the late King and the still-truckin’ Queen of Pop — Michael Jackson and Madonna, respectively — Perry creates an unforgettable event for her legions of fans.\"\n\nPerry's pre-recorded \"Birthday\" performance at the Newcastle Metro Radio Arena show was aired live during the 2014 Billboard Music Awards ceremony on May 18, 2014. On May 25, 2014 Perry headlined BBC Radio 1's Big Weekend, which was streamed live on the Radio 1 website. It was also broadcast live on BBC Three, BBC HD and BBC Radio 1. Highlights of the event were also broadcast on BBC Three and BBC HD during the week following the Big Weekend. A recorded live performance of \"Legends Never Die\" with Ferras at the Staples Center was uploaded to Ferras's official YouTube channel on October 11, 2014. Perry's performance during Rock In Rio on September 27, 2015, was broadcast live in Brazil on Multishow, Globo.com, and Gshow, and internationally was streamed live online on LiveXLive.com, AOL.com and AOL app.\n\nIt was announced that the final Sydney shows on December 12 and 13, 2014 would be filmed for a concert movie. Almost a year later, on November 23, 2015, it was broadcast on Network Seven. On March 28, 2015, Epix aired a two-hour concert special of the tour, as part of their \"Free Preview Weekend\". A short video interlude for \"Peacock\" was broadcast before Perry performed \"Teenage Dream\". During the exclusive Q&A with Epix, Perry confirmed that she will be making a DVD of the tour. She also revealed that she would change a couple of things for the DVD. Netflix added the tour's concert movie to its streaming service on June 26, 2015. The tour's concert movie was released on DVD, Blu-ray and Digital Download on October 30, 2015. All formats also include 30 minutes of exclusive extras.\n\nThis set list is from the show on May 30, 2014 in London, England. It does not represent of all concerts for the duration of the tour.\n\n\n\nCredits adapted from The Prismatic World Tour program.\n"}
{"id": "429911", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=429911", "title": "Ronnie Biggs", "text": "Ronnie Biggs\n\nRonald Arthur Biggs (8 August 1929 – 18 December 2013) was one of the men who planned and carried out the Great Train Robbery of 1963. He subsequently became notorious for his escape from prison in 1965, living as a fugitive for 36 years, and for his various publicity stunts while in exile. In 2001, he returned to the United Kingdom and spent several years in prison, where his health rapidly declined. Biggs was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and died in a nursing home in December 2013.\n\nBiggs was born in Stockwell, Lambeth, London, on 8 August 1929. As a child during the Second World War, he was evacuated to Flitwick, Bedfordshire, and then Cornwall.\n\nIn 1947, at age 18, Biggs enlisted in the Royal Air Force. He was dishonorably discharged for desertion two years later, after breaking into a local chemist shop. One month after that, he was convicted of stealing a car and sentenced to prison. On his release, he took part in a failed robbery attempt of a bookmaker office in Lambeth, South London. During his incarceration in HMP Wandsworth, he met Bruce Reynolds.\n\nAfter his third prison sentence, Biggs tried to go straight and trained as a carpenter. In February 1960, he married 21-year-old Charmian (Brent) Powell in Swanage, the daughter of a primary school headmaster. They had three sons together.\n\nBiggs, who needed money to fund a deposit on the purchase of a house for his family, happened to be working on the house of a train driver who was about to retire. The driver has been variously identified as \"Stan Agate\", or because of his age, \"Old Pete\" or \"Pop\". His real name is unknown, since he was never caught. He was the one who introduced Biggs to the train robbery plot. Reynolds gave Biggs the job of arranging for Agate to move the train after it had been waylaid.\n\nOn the night of the hold up, Biggs told his wife he was off logging with Reynolds in Wiltshire. The gang then stopped the mail train from Glasgow to London in the early hours of 8 August 1963, which was Biggs's 34th birthday. Stan Agate was unable to operate the main line diesel-electric locomotive because he had only driven shunting locomotives on the Southern Region. Therefore, driver of the intercepted train, Jack Mills, was coshed with an iron bar and forced to move the engine and mail carriages forward to a nearby bridge over a roadway, which had been chosen as the unloading point. Biggs' main task had been to get Agate to move the train and when it became obvious that the two were useless in that regard, they were banished to a waiting vehicle while the train was looted.\n\nHaving unloaded 120 of the 128 mailbags from the train within Reynolds' allotted timetable, and returned to their hideout at Leatherslade Farm, various sources show that the robbery yielded the participants £2.6 million (equivalent to £49 million in 2017); Biggs's share was £147,000 (equivalent to £ in 2018). With their timetable brought forward due to the police investigation closing in, Biggs returned home on the following Friday, with his stash in two canvas bags.\n\nAfter an accomplice failed to carry out his instructions to burn down Leatherslade Farm to destroy any evidence there, Biggs's fingerprints were found on a ketchup bottle by Metropolitan Police investigators. Three weeks later, he was arrested in South London, along with 11 other members of the gang. In 1964, nine of the 15-strong gang, including Biggs, were jailed for the crime. Most received sentences of 30 years.\n\nBiggs served 15 months before escaping from Wandsworth Prison on 8 July 1965, scaling the wall with a rope ladder and dropping onto a waiting removal van. He fled to Brussels by boat then sent a note to his wife to join him in Paris where he had acquired new identity papers and was undergoing plastic surgery. During his time in prison, Charmian had started an extramarital relationship and was pregnant by the time of his escape to the Continent. Choosing to support her husband, she had an illegal abortion in London and then travelled with their two sons to Paris to join Biggs.\n\nIn 1966, Biggs fled to Sydney, where he lived for several months before moving to the seaside suburb of Glenelg in Adelaide, South Australia. By the time Biggs and his family arrived in 1966, they had spent all but £7,000 (equivalent to £ in 2018) of his £147,000 share of the train robbery proceeds: £40,000 (equivalent to £ in 2018) on plastic surgery in Paris; £55,000 (equivalent to £ in 2018) paid as a package deal to get him out of the UK to Australia; and the rest on legal fees and expenses.\n\nIn 1967, just after their third child was born, Biggs received an anonymous letter from Britain telling him that Interpol suspected that he was in Australia and that he should move. In May 1967, the family moved to Melbourne, where he rented a house in the suburb of Blackburn North while his wife Charmian and their three sons lived in Doncaster East. Biggs had a number of jobs in Melbourne before undertaking set construction work at the Channel 9 TV studios. In October 1969, a newspaper report by a Reuters correspondent revealed that Biggs was living in Melbourne and claimed that police were closing in on him. The story led the 6 o'clock news at Channel 9 and Biggs fled his home, staying with family friends in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Five months later, he fled on a passenger liner from the Port of Melbourne, using the altered passport of a friend; his wife and sons remained in Australia. Twenty days later, the ship berthed in Panama and within two weeks Biggs had flown to Brazil.\n\nFollowing disclosure of Biggs' fathering a child in Brazil, Charmian agreed to a divorce in 1974, which was completed in 1976. Allowed by authorities to remain in Australia, she reverted to her maiden name of Brent and sold her story for £40,000 to an Australian media group to enable her to purchase the rented house that the family had lived in at the time of Biggs's flight to Brazil. Charmian later undertook a degree and became an editor, publisher and journalist. Her sons—who later visited Biggs a few times in Brazil— live anonymously. In 2012 Charmian acted as a consultant on the five-part ITV Studios docu-drama \"Mrs Biggs\"—in which she was played by actor Sheridan Smith—which recounts the couple's time from first meeting to Biggs's flight to Brazil.\n\nIn 1970, when Biggs arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil did not have an extradition treaty with the United Kingdom. In 1971, Biggs's eldest son, Nicholas, aged 10, died in a car crash in Melbourne.\n\nIn 1974, \"Daily Express\" reporter Colin MacKenzie received information suggesting that Biggs was in Rio de Janeiro; a team consisting of MacKenzie, photographer Bill Lovelace and reporter Michael O'Flaherty confirmed this and broke the story. Scotland Yard detective Jack Slipper arrived soon afterwards, but Biggs could not be extradited because his girlfriend, nightclub dancer Raimunda de Castro, was pregnant. Brazilian law at the time did not allow a parent of a Brazilian child to be extradited.\n\nDuring 1974, in Rio, Biggs, an avid jazz fan, collaborated with Bruce Henri (an American double bass player), Jaime Shields, and Aureo de Souza to record \"Mailbag Blues\", a musical narrative of his life that he intended to use as a movie soundtrack. This album was left undiscovered until it was finally released in 2004 by whatmusic.com.\n\nIn April 1977 Biggs attended a cocktail party on board the Royal Navy frigate , which was in Rio for a courtesy visit, but he was not arrested. Though in Brazil he was safe from extradition, Biggs's status as a known felon meant he could not work, visit bars or be away from home after 10:00 p.m. To provide an income, Biggs's family hosted barbecues at his home in Rio, where tourists could meet Biggs and hear him recount his involvement in the robbery, which, in fact, was minor. Biggs was even visited by former footballer Stanley Matthews, whom Biggs afterwards invited to his apartment after hearing that he was in Rio. \"We had tea on the small balcony at the rear of his home, and one of the first things he asked was, 'How are Charlton Athletic doing?' It turned out he had supported Charlton from being a small boy and had often seen me play at The Valley.\" Around this time, \"Ronnie Biggs\" mugs, coffee cups and T-shirts also appeared throughout Rio.\n\nBiggs recorded vocals on two songs for \"The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle\", Julien Temple's film about the Sex Pistols. The basic tracks for \"No One is Innocent\" (a.k.a. \"The Biggest Blow (A Punk Prayer)\"/\"Cosh The Driver\") and \"Belsen Was a Gas\" were recorded with guitarist Steve Jones and drummer Paul Cook at a studio in Brazil shortly after the Sex Pistols' final performance, with overdubs added in an English studio at a later date. \"No One is Innocent\" was released as a single in the UK on 30 June 1978 and reached number 7 in the UK Singles Chart. The sleeve showed a British actor dressed as Nazi leader Martin Bormann playing bass with the group.\nIn March 1981, Biggs was kidnapped by a gang of British ex-soldiers. The boat they took him aboard suffered mechanical problems off Barbados, and the stranded kidnappers and Biggs were rescued by the Barbados coastguard and towed into port in Barbados. The kidnappers hoped to collect a reward from the British police; however, like Brazil, Barbados was found to have had no valid extradition treaty with the United Kingdom (a fact which chess player David Levy claimed to have paid lawyers to unearth) and Biggs was sent back to Brazil.\n\nBiggs's son by de Castro, Michael Biggs, eventually became a member of the successful children's programme and music band Turma do Balão Mágico, bringing a new source of income to his father. In a short time, however, the band faded into obscurity and dissolved, leaving father and son in financial difficulty again.\n\nIn 1991, Biggs sang vocals for the songs \"Police on My Back\" and \"Carnival in Rio\" by German punk band Die Toten Hosen. In 1993, Biggs sang on three tracks for the album \"Bajo Otra Bandera\" by Argentinian punk band Pilsen.\n\nIn 1997 the UK and Brazil ratified an extradition treaty. Two months later, the UK Government made a formal request to the Brazilian government for Biggs's extradition. Biggs had stated that he would no longer oppose extradition. English lawyer Nigel Sangster QC travelled to Brazil to advise Biggs. The extradition request was rejected by the Brazilian Supreme Court, giving Biggs the right to live in Brazil for the rest of his life.\n\nIn 2001 Biggs announced to \"The Sun\" newspaper that he would be willing to return to the UK.\n\nHaving 28 years of his sentence left to serve, Biggs was aware that he would be detained upon arrival in Britain. His trip back to Britain on a private jet was paid for by \"The Sun\" newspaper, which reportedly paid Michael Biggs £20,000 plus other expenses in return for exclusive rights to the news story. Biggs arrived on 7 May 2001, whereupon he was immediately arrested and re-imprisoned.\n\nHis son Michael said in a press release that, contrary to some press reports, Biggs did not return to the UK simply to receive health care which was available in Brazil and he had friends who would have contributed to such expenses, but that it was his desire to \"walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter\". John Mills, son of train driver Jack Mills, was unforgiving: \"I deeply resent those, including Biggs, who have made money from my father's death. Biggs should serve his punishment.\" Mills never fully recovered from his injuries sustained during the robbery. He died of an unrelated cause (leukaemia) in 1970.\n\nOn 14 November 2001, Biggs petitioned Governor Hynd of HMP Belmarsh for early release on compassionate grounds based on his poor health. He had been treated four times at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Woolwich in less than six months. His health was deteriorating rapidly and he asked to be released into the care of his son for his remaining days. The application was denied. On 10 August 2005, it was reported that Biggs had contracted MRSA. His representatives, seeking for his release on grounds of compassion, said that their client's death was likely to be imminent. On 26 October 2005, the Home Secretary Charles Clarke declined his appeal stating that his illness was not terminal. Home Office compassion policy is to release prisoners with three months left to live. Biggs was claimed by his son Michael to need a tube for feeding and to have \"difficulty\" speaking.\n\nOn 4 July 2007, Biggs was moved from Belmarsh Prison to Norwich Prison on compassionate grounds. In December 2007, Biggs issued a further appeal, from Norwich Prison, asking to be released from jail to die with his family: \"I am an old man and often wonder if I truly deserve the extent of my punishment. I have accepted it and only want freedom to die with my family and not in jail. I hope Mr. Straw decides to allow me to do that. I have been in jail for a long time and I want to die a free man. I am sorry for what happened. It has not been an easy ride over the years. Even in Brazil I was a prisoner of my own making. There is no honour to being known as a Great Train Robber. My life has been wasted.\"\n\nIn January 2009, after a series of strokes that were said to have rendered him unable to speak or walk, it was claimed in the press that Biggs was to be released in August 2009 and would die a \"free man\". His son Michael had also claimed that the Parole Board might bring the release date forward to July 2009. On 13 February 2009, it was reported that Biggs had been taken to hospital from his cell at Norwich Prison, suffering from pneumonia. This was confirmed the following day by his son Michael, who said Biggs had serious pneumonia but was stable. News of his condition prompted fresh calls from Michael Biggs for his release on compassionate grounds.\n\nOn 23 April the Parole Board recommended that Biggs be released on 4 July, having served a third of his 30-year sentence. However, on 1 July Jack Straw did not accept the Parole Board's recommendation and refused parole, stating that Biggs was 'wholly unrepentant'. On 28 July 2009, Biggs was readmitted to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital with pneumonia. He had been admitted to the same hospital a month earlier with a chest infection and a fractured hip but returned to prison on 17 July 2009. His son Michael said, in one of his frequent news releases: \"It's the worst he's ever been. The doctors have just told me to rush there.\"\n\nOn 30 July 2009, it was claimed by representatives of Biggs that he had been given \"permission\" to challenge the decision to refuse him parole. However, the Home Office stated only that an application for the early release on compassionate grounds of a prisoner at HMP Norwich had been received by the public protection casework section in the National Offender Management Service. Biggs was released from custody on 6 August, two days before his 80th birthday, on 'compassionate grounds'.\n\nFollowing his release from prison, Biggs's health improved, leading to suggestions that he might soon be moved from hospital to a nursing home. In response to claims that Biggs's state of health had been faked, his lawyer stated, \"This man is going to die, there is going to be no Lazarus coming back from the dead, he is ill, he is seriously ill.\" However, Biggs himself stated, \"I've got a bit of living to do yet. I might even surprise them all by lasting until Christmas, that would be fantastic.\"\n\nOn 29 May 2010, Biggs was again admitted to hospital in London after complaining of chest pain. He underwent tests at Barnet Hospital. His son Michael stated, \"he's conscious but he's in a lot of pain\". In August 2010, it was claimed by the \"Sunday Mirror\" that Biggs would be attending a gala dinner where he would be collecting a lifetime achievement award for his services to crime.\n\nOn 10 February 2011, Biggs was admitted to Barnet Hospital with another suspected stroke. His son Michael said he was conscious and preparing to have a CT scan and a series of other tests to determine what had happened. On 17 November 2011, Biggs launched his new and updated autobiography, \"Ronnie Biggs: Odd Man Out – The Last Straw\", at Shoreditch House, London. He was unable to speak and used a word board to communicate with the press.\n\nOn 12 January 2012, ITV Studios announced it had commissioned a five-part drama, \"Mrs Biggs\", to be based around the life of Biggs's wife Charmian, played by Sheridan Smith and Biggs by Daniel Mays. Charmian Biggs acted as a consultant on the series and travelled to Britain from Australia to visit Biggs in February 2012, just before filming for \"Mrs Biggs\".\n\nIn March 2013, Biggs attended the funeral of fellow train robber, Bruce Reynolds. In July 2013, \"The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013\" was published, with input from Biggs and Reynolds.\n\nOn 18 December 2013, aged 84, Biggs died at the Carlton Court Care Home in Barnet, north London, where he was being cared for. His death coincidentally occurred hours before the first broadcast of a two-part BBC television series \"The Great Train Robbery\", in which Biggs was portrayed by actor Jack Gordon. Biggs' body was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 3 January 2014. The coffin was covered with the Union Flag, the Flag of Brazil and a Charlton Athletic scarf. An honour guard of British Hells Angels escorted his hearse to the crematorium. The Reverend Dave Tomlinson officiated at Biggs' funeral, for which he drew public criticism; Tomlinson responded to critics by using the Bible verse \"Judge not, that ye be not judged\".\n\n"}
{"id": "619770", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=619770", "title": "Royal Academy Summer Exhibition", "text": "Royal Academy Summer Exhibition\n\nThe Summer Exhibition is an open art exhibition held annually by the Royal Academy in Burlington House, Piccadilly in central London, England, during the months of June, July, and August. The exhibition includes paintings, prints, drawings, sculpture, architectural designs and models, and is the largest and most popular open exhibition in the United Kingdom.\n\nWhen the Royal Academy was founded in 1768 one of its key objectives was to establish an annual exhibition, open to all artists of merit, which could be visited by the public. The first Summer Exhibition took place in 1769; it has been held every year since without exception.\n\nToday, around 1,000 works are selected each year from as many as 10,000 entries representing some 5,000 artists. Any artist (living, known or unknown) may submit up to two works at a fee of £25 per piece for selection by The Summer Exhibition Selection and Hanging Committee. Due to the significant increase in the volume of entries over recent years, the number of entries per artist was reduced to 2 (from 3) and the fee was increased £18 per piece. The committee is formed from the Council of Academicians (the governing body of the RA) and is traditionally chaired by the President of the Royal Academy. In addition to those works selected by the committee, all 80 Academicians are entitled to have six of their own pieces in the exhibition.\n\nFor the 2006 exhibition, the academy received a statue and a plinth from David Hensel. By mistake, the two parts were judged independently, with the result that the statue was rejected and the plinth put on display.\n\nThe RA Summer Exhibition usually opens to the public in early June, preceded by a series of private viewings. The main event is called \"Varnishing Day\", the day that, according to popular legend, artists would come to add a final coat of varnish to their paintings (compare: \"vernissage\"). Traditionally, artists walk in procession from Burlington House to St James's Church, Piccadilly, where a service is held. At the opening reception the shortlists for various prizes are announced.\n\nSome years have particular themes. The 2005 exhibition theme was \"Printmaking and the multiple\". In 2006, the theme was \"From Life.\" In 2008, the theme was \"Man Made\". The theme for 2010 was \"Raw\". In 2011, the selection committee agreed to have no specific theme. \n\nAlmost all exhibited works are for sale; the Academy receives 30% of the purchase price. In 2003, this amounted to a sum of some £2,000,000 for the institution, which receives no financial support from the state or crown.\n\n\nOver £70,000 prize money, including the £25,000 Charles Wollaston Award, is awarded each year at the Summer Exhibition. In addition, a £10.000 architectural prize is awarded.\n\n\n\n"}

In July 1937, he joined the recently formed Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve and learnt to fly at weekends. \nAt the outbreak of war in September 1939, he was called up for regular service and completed his pilot training. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 21 October 1940, with seniority from 9 August 1940.\n\nHe joined No 608 Squadron attached to Coastal Command flying Avro Ansons on anti-submarine and convoy escort operations. At the end of 1940, he volunteered to join No 1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (PRU) flying Spitfires.\n\nHe was mentioned in despatches on 11 June 1942 and promoted to flight lieutenant on 21 October 1942, with seniority from 9 August 1942.\n\nDowse was shot down on 15 August 1941 while on a reconnaissance mission to photograph the German battleships and at Brest. He was wounded in the leg and quickly captured by the Germans, becoming a prisoner of war.\n\nHis first escape attempt came on 1 December 1941, when he was recovering from the leg wound sustained when he was shot down. He escaped from a hospital at Stadtroda in Thuringia. However, Dowse was recaptured three days later attempting to cross the Dutch-German border.\n\nHis next attempt was from Stalag IX-C at Bad Sulza on 21 January 1942. He exchanged identities with a Canadian POW and joined a work party. He managed to slip away unnoticed when outside the camp. After travelling some distance by train to Werwitz, he continued on foot, through deep snow, towards the German-Belgian frontier where he was re-captured five days later, suffering from extreme exhaustion and exposure.\n\nFollowing a brief period in hospital, he was transferred to Oflag VI-B at Warburg.\n\nAt Warburg, he participated in the excavation of an escape tunnel, which was completed on 18 April 1942. He, and 34 others (including the legless air ace, Douglas Bader, and Dowse's later escaping partner, Stanislaw Krol), prepared to escape. However, as the tunnel broke surface, it became clear that it was slightly too short, and the exit hole had emerged directly in the patrol path of a German sentry. Six RAF officers managed to escape, but, due to the proximity of the sentry, no one else, including Dowse, was able to do so.\n\nIn May 1942, Dowse was transferred to Stalag Luft III at Sagan with a batch of other RAF officers.\n\nDowse's next escape attempt happened on 30 November 1942, when he and Flt Lt Stanisław 'Danny' Krol cut through the wire into the camp's central compound and crawled across that compound using blankets as camouflage. They were in the process of cutting the perimeter wire to get out when they were arrested and sentenced to 14 days' solitary confinement.\n\nDowse, who spoke some German, befriended a German corporal who worked alongside Dowse in the camp′s censor office. From this contact, Dowse was able to gain useful information and documents which aided the camp escape organisation. He was able to 'borrow' a genuine gate pass, which was copied by the camp's forgery department, and a copy was used on the delousing break mass escape in June 1943.\n\nThrough this same contact, Dowse was able to gain information about the German secret rocket establishment at Peenemünde. This information was passed on to British intelligence via secret codes written into POWs' letters home.\n\nDowse also learnt that the Gestapo had liquidation plans for Roger Bushell if he were caught escaping again. Dowse warned Bushell, who chose to ignore the warning.\n\nDuring his time in the North Compound at Stalag Luft III, Dowse became involved with the construction of the three tunnels intended for a mass escape, masterminded by Roger Bushell, Harry Day and Canadian Wally Floody, who was instrumental in the tunnel′s design and construction. One tunnel, codenamed 'Harry' which Dowse had helped build, was completed in early 1944.\nOn 24 March 1944, he took part in The Great Escape through tunnel 'Harry', escaping with Flt Lt Stanisław 'Danny' Krol. Dowse had drawn escape number 21, and was disguised as a Danish foreign worker, equipped with the appropriate (forged) documents and clothing provided by his 'contact'.\n\nDowse and Krol travelled mainly by foot towards the Polish border, but were recaptured just inside Germany on 6 April 1944. They were amongst the last escapers to be re-captured. Taken to the local Gestapo headquarters, they were interrogated, before being separated.\n\nDowse was sent to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Stanisław 'Danny' Krol was among the 50 recaptured officers to be executed.\n\nAt Sachsenhausen, Dowse found himself with three fellow survivors of the 'Great Escape': (Harry Day, Johnnie Dodge and Bertram James). They were placed in Sonderlager A (Special Camp A) within the main camp. Here were housed a handful of other 'political' prisoners, including SOE agent Peter Churchill, two Russian generals, various other Russians, Poles, Italians and four British soldiers of Irish origin. Later, they were joined by British Commando Jack Churchill.\n\nDowse and James almost immediately began another tunnel, which was kept secret from all non-British personnel. This was completed and used on the night of 23 September 1944, when Dowse, James, Day, Dodge and Jack Churchill escaped. \n\nDowse paired up with Day and they travelled by train into Berlin. However, they were recaptured the next day when hiding in a bombed out house in the Berlin suburb of Mahlsdorf.\n\nPlaced in the death cells back at Sachsenhausen, all the escapers who had been re-captured were spared execution mainly thanks to Day's efforts under interrogation.\n\nIn April 1945, after spending several months in solitary confinement Dowse, together with other prominent prisoners (Prominenten), was transferred to the Tyrol via concentration camps at Flossenburg and Dachau.\n\nHe was awarded the Military Cross for his services as a POW. This award was published in the \"London Gazette\" on 16 August 1946.\n\nDowse served as an equerry at Buckingham Palace. For a number of years in the 1950s, at the time of the communist insurgency, he worked in Malaya as a rubber plantation manager in the Penang Settlement. After the war, he also worked, possibly unwittingly, for a short time as a representative for Bernie Cornfeld's insurance fraud, \"The Dover Plan\", as well as other unsuccessful and/or dubious ventures. He lived mainly on his heroic stories from the war, which were a \"laissez passer\" in post-war society.\n\nHe married three times, for the most part to women of some fortune, but was single at the time of his death. (He married Florence Marion Byers, daughter of wealthy businessman and Liberal, C. Charles Byers, then ran off, in 1968, with \"Wings\" Day's wife, to his former superior officer's eternal chagrin.)\n\nIn retirement, Dowse divided his time between elegant homes in Chelsea and Monte Carlo.\n\nHe returned to Stalag Luft III in March 1994 and March 2004 to mark the anniversaries of the Great Escape, and to commemorate his friends who did not survive.\n\n\n"}

It has been the home of the Kingston Symphony since 1964. The main theatre seats 776 people, and has a proscenium stage and an orchestra pit. The building also houses a smaller black box theatre, The Baby Grand, which seats 105 people.\n\nBuilt in 1901–02 on the site of the former Martin's Opera House (built 1879 and destroyed by fire on 6 December 1898), The Grand Theatre was originally known as the Grand Opera House. The theatre's gala performance was on 14 January 1902. From 1905–36 the theatre was owned and operated by impresario Ambrose J. Small. Notable performers to appear at the theatre during its early years included Sarah Bernhardt, Al Jolson, and Nellie Melba. In 1936 the theatre was sold by Small to Famous Players who decided to shut the theatre down and turn the building into a cinema venue. After two years of restoration, the theatre reopened as a movie house on 20 May 1938, and operated in that capacity until the theatre closed again in 1961.\n\nWere it not for a group of concerned citizens forming the Kingston Arts Council, the Grand Theatre would have been demolished in the early 1960s. The Kingston Arts Council successfully campaigned and advocated against demolition and for the theatre to be restored as a civic theatre that would serve as the home of the Kingston Symphony and as a venue for both local and touring groups. Work accordingly began in 1964 and the newly named The Grand Theatre opened its doors on 20 May 1966 with a performance of Dora Mavor Moore's musical revue \"Spring Thaw\". In 1978 a series of ongoing renovations began which established new lounges, higher quality backstage facilities, and The Baby Grand was co-founded by Sarah Garton Stanley and Eric Kaskens in 1985 (and was renovated and reopened in November 1990).\n\n"}

This is followed by a Ben Bernie caricature called \"Ben Birdie\", feuding with \"Walter Finchell\". The same spoof was used in the cartoon \"The Coo-Coo Nut Grove\" (1936). Walter Winchell had a well-publicized feud with Bernie at the time, which, like Jack Benny's \"feud\" with Fred Allen, was faked for publicity purposes – Bernie and Winchell were actually good friends.\n\nNext is \"Milton Squirrel\" (Milton Berle, emcee of \"Gillette Community Sing\") introducing \"Wendell Howl\" (Wendell Hall) and an audience trying to figure out which page to go to in their songbooks, which results in Wendell getting pelted by the audience's songbooks.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. \n\nAlthough the monks Tutilo and Notker already inspired briefly lay theatre in St. Gallen during the Middle Ages, theatre did not flourish for a long time because of moral concerns. In the early 19th century interest in theatre was reawakened. After the first performance on October 14, 1801 in modest surroundings, a \"Theater Stock Company\" was founded in 1805 to support a local professional theatre group. When they needed a larger place for their performances, the architect Johann Christoph Kunkler built a theater into which the group moved in 1857. This \"Kunkler-Bau\" remained the home of the formerly called \"Stadttheater St. Gallen\" for 111 years until 1968. The building was then demolished. \nThe current building was designed by the Swiss architect Claude Paillard and inaugurated with Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" on March 15, 1968. The building houses two stages, the larger one allows 742 persons and the studio 100 persons to attend.\n\nWith the construction of the new building, the stock company was replaced by a consortium with participation of the town of St. Gallen and its canton. Surrounding communities thereafter joined in the venture. The \"Genossenschaft Konzert und Theater St. Gallen\" (\"Cooperative for concert and theatre of St. Gallen\") is since 2000 the supporting organization for the orchestre and theatre of St. Gallen. The \"Sinfonieorchester St. Gallen\" therefore provides orchestral support for operas and musicals. \n\nEach year about 20 new productions are introduced. Among them, in 2009, the theater featured the world premiere of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\", a musical by Frank Wildhorn. The theatre's 390 annual performances are seen by about 140,000 attendees.\n\n"}

During the United States presidential election, 2008, Muñoz became notable for publicly defending Joe Wurzelbacher, and also for campaigning with Sarah Palin. Muñoz is a member of the Virginia state Board of Housing and Community Development, and has a conservative Latino radio show.\n\nMuñoz, a Colombian immigrant, is presently a small construction company owner and a United States citizen. He is a resident of Woodbridge, Virginia. Muñoz claims to have 250 cousins.\n\nMuñoz hosts \"America Eres Tu\", an hour-long Spanish language radio show that is broadcast on Saturday afternoons. On his radio show, Muñoz covers social issues and takes the time to explain conservative fiscal issues. Many Hispanics don't know \"we owe money to other countries,\" Muñoz says, \"they don't understand we have a deficit, they don't understand the magnitude of the debt, so I'm there trying to explain it in simple Spanish.\"\n\nMuñoz created a 527 organization called the Conservative Hispanic Coalition. Muñoz also supports Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. In 2010, Muñoz considered challenging Corey Stewart, the Chairman of the Prince William Board of County Supervisors, in the Republican primary. According to the Daily Caller, \"At a time when political leaders in both parties tend to understand their constituents as discrete and predictable voting blocks aligned by race and ethnicity, Munoz is a reminder that the American political reality is more complex, and inspiring.\" Muñoz campaigned for Governor Bob McDonnell in the Virginia gubernatorial election, 2009.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Tito Muñoz received substantial media attention. He became known for wearing a yellow hard hat with a McCain-Palin bumper sticker, an orange reflector jacket, as well as sunglasses. He campaigned with Sarah Palin, and was known for a confrontation with reporters. Will Rabbe, of the Independent Film Channel, has posted a video about Muñoz and his interaction with reporters. Five days before the election, Muñoz appeared on Fox News' \"Hannity & Colmes\", accusing the media of \"hiding the truth about\" Obama.\n\nDuring this time, Muñoz coined the phrase: \"Born in Colombia, Made in the U.S.A.\"\n\nIn April 2011, Muñoz, who identifies as a Tea Party activist, formed his own Political Action Committee called TitoPAC. Muñoz ran for the Virginia General Assembly seat held by State Senator Toddy Puller.

{"id": "9010475", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9010475", "title": "Troyl", "text": "Troyl\n\nTroyl is a colloquial Cornish word meaning a barn-dance or céilidh, a social evening of dance, music and song.\n\nEdward Lluyd (1660?-1709) knew the Cornish verb \"troillia\" - to twist, twirl, whirl, spin round. Edward Veale of Pentire, Newquay used the noun \"troil\" in the 1880s to describe a Cornish céilidh in Newquay. Robert Morton Nance collected the noun \"troyl\" in the 1920s. He classified the word as a 'Cornish dialect survival', and knew the similar Welsh noun which has the same Brittonic root. \"Troyll\" appeared in Robert Morton Nance's 1938 Cornish English dictionary with the meanings - circuit, spiral, spin, turn and lathe. Since the Cornish Dance Revival of the 1980s the noun \"Troyl\" has been consistently used to denote a Cornish céilidh.\n\nSpeaking of social life associated with the fish cellars in Newquay in the late 19th century, Edward Veale related that 'A dance or ‘troil ... always terminated the pilchard season. This was a feast for those connected with the cellars, each cellar having its own troil. After the feast, which was given in the loft, games and dancing followed. These were kept up until the small hours of the morning, the music being provided by a fiddler.’ Such Troils were also noted by Sarah Teague Husband and Edgar Rees, writing of 19th century Newquay. Veale also remembered seeing the step dance, Lattapuch, in the Unity Fish Cellars, Newquay in the 1880s, and dancing the Lancers. It seems clear that social dancing, step dancing - sometimes competitive, music and song were involved. Such events occurred on the completion of a particularly successful catch and at the end of the pilchard season.\n\nSince 1980 Troyls have been staged with increasing frequency since the collection of a core repertoire of dances by Merv and Alison Davey, and the writing of numbers of modern folk dances in Cornish style by enthusiasts from several Cornish dance groups. The core repertoire has now been published in a book/tape/videotape package, and other DVDs and books are progressively becoming available.\n\nA typical Troyl has a mixture of social (public dances), usually \"called\" to assist the less experienced. Most will be set dances, but as karoles were once found in Cornwall, and processional dances (furrys) survive to this day, so various rondes and farandoles are also danced. Between such items there will often be demonstration dances, music, song, step-dancing, or storytelling (droll telling).\n\n"}
{"id": "18537936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18537936", "title": "Uppsala Conflict Data Program", "text": "Uppsala Conflict Data Program\n\nThe Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) is a data collection project on organized violence housed at Uppsala University in Sweden that has been collecting information on armed conflict since 1946 and making it publicly available through its annual report, \"States in Armed Conflict.\" Beginning in Since 2004, the constantly-updated UCDP is also publicly available. The UCDP collects both quantitative and qualitative data on organized violence (e.g., fatality statistics, georeferenced event data, and armed actor and conflict descriptions) that is used by social science researchers, journalists, and policymakers.\n\nThe UCDP began recording information on ongoing violent conflicts in the 1970s. It became clear that more systematic and global data on armed conflicts was necessary for conducting research in the expanding academic discipline of peace and conflict studies.\n\nInitially, the program collected data only on so-called \"armed conflicts\", defined as fighting exceeding 25 battle-related deaths between two actors of which at least one was a state. In later years, the data gathering grew, and the program also began collecting data on \"non-state conflicts\" (where neither party was a state) and \"one-sided violence\" (where an organized group attacked unarmed civilians).\n\nThe UCDP's data is published annually in such publications as the \"SIPRI Yearbook\" and the \"Journal of Peace Research\". The UCDP also makes its data publicly available through its website and previously in its publication, \"States in Armed Conflict\".\n\nThe UCDP is located at the Department of Peace and Conflict Research of Uppsala University in Sweden. The program is led by Associate Professor Kristine Eck, and employs approximately 10-15 research assistants and researchers. A number of scholars and Ph.D. candidates are also attached to the program and tasked with carrying out research for the collection of conflict data. In addition to collecting data, the program disseminates knowledge on trends and dynamics of armed conflict to the public via lectures at academic and government forums.\n\nThe UCDP works closely with both the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and the Human Security Report Project, based within the School for International Studies at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The UCDP collaborates with PRIO to create its datasets and provides the Human Security Research Project with data for its annual publication, the \"Human Security Report\". The UCDP's data is published annually in collaboration with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and appears in the \"SIPRI Yearbook\".\n\nHundreds of scholars have used the UCDP's data for research. The UCDP couples data collection with research on conflict resolution and the dynamics of conflicts. Much of the research done by UCDP staff is published in the UCDP's \"States in Armed Conflict\" annual report, the annual \"SIPRI Yearbook\", and the \"Journal of Peace Research\".\n\nThe Armed Conflict Dataset is a joint project between the UCDP and PRIO that records armed conflicts from 1946–2016 that result in a minimum of 25 battle-related deaths and in which at least one actor is the government of a state. Data is collected by keying specific search words in the Factiva Database, an online resource containing over 10,000 different newspapers, newswires, and other sources, as well as published books, case studies, and journals (\"Africa Research Bulletin\", \"Africa Confidential\", NGO publications). The dataset is updated annually, with Version 17.1-2017 being the most recent.\n\nEvery armed conflict is classified as a dyad in the dataset and assigned an ID number. A dyad consists of two conflicting primary parties. Dyads can last multiple years and are coded for intensity level (\"minor\" for those with less than 1,000 deaths; \"major\" for those with more than 1,000 deaths), region (Americas, Asia, Middle East, Africa, Europe), incompatibility (government, territory, government and territory), and type (extrasystemic, interstate, internal, internationalized internal). The start date, end date, year, and location of conflict are also provided as well as the precision of the start and end date.\n\nUCDP data has been published in the \"SIPRI Yearbook\" since 1988. Since 1993, a list of all armed conflicts also appears in the \"Journal of Peace Research\". Data on non-state conflicts appears in the \"Human Security Report\" from 2004. The UCDP has also releases (annually) its own report, \"States in Armed Conflict\". UCDP data is also frequently used by journalists, government agencies, and other organizations to produce overviews of peace and conflict in the world. One prominent index that uses UCDP data is the Global Peace Index.\n\nA battle-related death is one that is caused by combat between conflicting parties over a contested incompatibility. These deaths can be caused by traditional battlefield fighting, guerrilla activities, urban warfare, and any kind of bombardment of military units, cities, and villages. Guerrilla activities include hit-and-run attacks and ambushes, and examples of urban warfare include bombs, explosions, and assassinations. Targets of attacks are generally military, state institutions, and state representatives. However, civilians are collateral damage, and both military and civilian deaths are accounted for in the dataset.\n\nUCDP has three ways of estimating battle-related deaths: best estimate, low estimate, and high estimate. The best estimate is the aggregate of the most reliable numbers for all battle-related incidents during a year. The low estimate is the aggregate of low estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year, and the high estimate is the aggregate of high estimates for all battle-related incidents during a year. These estimates are found in both conflict-year based datasets and dyad-year based datasets. The averages of deaths in the most recent of each kind of dataset are:\n\nUCDP gathers and updates data on a yearly basis. They have datasets available from 1989 to 2016. Every event lists the date of the event, reporting source, primary source, actors involved, place of event, what happened, and the estimates of fatalities. The staff reads all the reports, and the information is entered manually. Furthermore, the aggregate results are compared to figures in official documents, special reports, and news media.\n\nUCDP uses both printed and electronic public sources for gathering information. The main source is the Factiva Database that is composed of over 10,000 newspapers, newswires, and other sources from around the globe. UCDP uses at least one major newswire (Reuters, Xinhua, EFE) and BBC Monitoring. Additional sources include news agencies, newly published books, case studies, journals like \"Africa Research Bulletin\", research reports, documents of international and multinational organizations, publications by NGOs such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, and documents of fighting parties. Sources are judged according to the context in which they are published, and reports are traced back to the primary source to establish reliability.\n\nThe program divides armed conflict into three categories: \"state-based conflict\", \"non-state conflict\", and \"one-sided violence\".\n\nState-based conflict refers to what most people intuitively perceive as \"war\"; fighting either between two states, or between a state and a rebel group that challenges it. The UCDP defines an armed state-based conflict as: \"An armed conflict is a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in one calendar year\". The program's definition differs somewhat from other data collection programs, such as the Correlates of War Project, which only counts conflicts where at least 1,000 deaths have been recorded during one calendar year. In UCDP, data such an armed conflict is labelled as having the intensity level of \"war\", whilst armed conflicts that reap between 25 and 999 battle-related deaths are seen as having the intensity of a \"minor\" armed conflict.\n\nNon-state conflicts are those conflicts in which none of the warring parties is a state. Examples of non-state conflicts include the Fatah–Hamas conflict of 2006 and 2007, inter-ethnic group conflicts such as the Lou Nuer–Murle conflict of 2009–2012, and inter-cartel violence in the Mexican Drug War.\n\nOne-sided violence is defined as: \"The use of armed force by the government of a state or by a formally organized group against civilians which results in at least 25 deaths in a year\". Examples include actions by the governments of Sudan, Myanmar, and Syria against civilians, as well as actions of non-state organizations such as Los Zetas, Al-Qaeda, and the Lord's Resistance Army against civilians.\n\nIn 2011, the UCDP reported 37 active state-based armed conflicts:\n\nEurope\n• Russia (territory: Caucasus Emirate)\n\nMiddle East\n• Iran (government)\n• Iraq (government)\n• Israel (territory: Palestine)\n• Syria (government)\n• Turkey (territory: Kurdistan)\n• Yemen (government)\n\nAsia\n• Afghanistan (government)\n• Cambodia, Thailand (territory: common border)\n• India (territory: Kashmir)\n• India (government)\n• Myanmar (territory: Karen)\n• Myanmar (territory: Kachin)\n• Myanmar (territory: Shan)\n• Pakistan (territory: Baluchistan)\n• Pakistan (government)\n• Philippines (territory: Mindanao)\n• Philippines (government)\n• Tajikistan (government)\n• Thailand (territory: Patani)\n\nAfrica\n• Algeria (government)\n• Central African Republic (government)\n• Ethiopia (territory: Ogaden)\n• Ethiopia (territory: Oromiya)\n• Ivory Coast (government)\n• Libya (government)\n• Mauritania (government)\n• Nigeria (government)\n• Rwanda (government)\n• Senegal (territory: Casamance)\n• Somalia (government)\n• Southern Sudan (government)\n• Sudan (government)\n• Sudan (territory: Abyei)\n• Uganda (government)\n\nAmericas\n• Colombia (government)\n• USA (government)\n\nOut of these 37 armed conflicts, a total of six (Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Libya, Somalia and Sudan) reached the intensity level of \"War\", meaning that more than 1,000 battle-related deaths were recorded in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, six conflicts also reached the intensity level of \"war\".\n\n\nEdward Herman, Professor Emeritus of Finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and his colleague David Peterson, who together co-authored \"The Politics of Genocide\", have accused the UCDP of using \"politicized [...] methodologies\" in an effort to \"minimize U.S.- and Western-led warmaking and killing.\" Exemplifying these assertions, they compare the classification of US involvement in Guatemala and the perception of Soviet involvement in Afghanistan by the program.\n\nThe UCDP's homepage is located at http://www.ucdp.uu.se. The UCDP also has an on-line database of organised violence, accessible at http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/search.php. The database provides free information on state-based and non-state conflicts, as well as one-sided violence. It also includes descriptive information on causes and histories of conflicts and one-sided violence and brief descriptions of rebel groups, governments, and related items.\n\nAs of July 2010, the UCDP Conflict Database is available as an iPhone application and an Android application.\n\n\n"}

Operating in the Free Territory of Trieste after 1947, it was active until 1961. From 1945 to 1954 it was directed by Col. Gerald Richardson, a former Scotland Yard officer.\n\nThe Yugoslav 4th Army and the Slovenian 9th Corps entered Trieste on May 1, 1945. The 2nd Division (New Zealand) arrived on the next day and forced the surrender of the 2,000 German Army troops holding out in Trieste, who warily had refused to capitulate to partisan troops, fearing they would be executed by them. An uneasy truce developed between New Zealand and Yugoslav troops. On June 12, 1945 the Yugoslav forces were driven out by the British Army; American and British took over the administration of the Territory, creating the Allied Military Government on the western part of the Julian March or Venezia-Giulia. On June 30, 1945 the AMG of Venetia-Giulia with an executive order signed by, US Army Colonel Nelson W. Monfort, dissolved all the existing Police Forces in the City of Trieste and other parts of Venezia Giulia, including the Popular Defense Corps or Difesa Popolare, created by the Yugoslavs during their forty-day occupation of the city, from May 1 to June 12, 1945.\nThe allied Forces then had to create a new Civil Police Force to maintain law and order in the territory, and to work alongside their Military Police Forces, to deal with the local civilian matters. The newly created Corps was named Venezia-Giulia Police Force (V.G.P.F); Civil Police was an unconventional name given to the Force, to distinguish them from the Military Police Forces, British and US, which were also operating in the Venezia Giulia, A zone, at the end of WW2. They were also known with the moniker \"Cerini\" or \"Wax Matches\", because of the uniform they worn. In fact the contrast between the huge white helmet and the dark blue British Uniform, reminded to the population, the shape of a Wax Match. \n\nThe Venezia Giulia Police Force was created in September 1945, after the training school opened in August 1945 had trained and graduated men who had passed a medical test and had their political records scrutinized. It was organized into 7 divisions: Administrative and Personnel, Uniformed Police Criminal Investigation, Transportation, Training, Quartermaster (supply) and Prison Service. Divisions had subdivisions or sections, covering every branch of service:\n\nTraining Facilities and Police School Academy as well as Police band, with 60 members, were located at the Beleno Barracks, in Trieste in Street Pasquale Revoltella number 29-35. In addition there were Fishery Patrol, Motor Boat Patrol, Railway Police Service and Female Police. Although Fishery Police was part of the V.G.P.F., they did not share the same civilian status, they were Military, and wore different uniforms. Fishery Police were given the tasks that nowadays are commonly carried out by the Coast Guard such as Territorial Waters and Fishing boats protection. The Fishery Police Patrol, who was also in charge of the Port area security, and was established in August 1945 after few British Officers had entered gun-in-hand into the Trieste Port Authority Offices, who were still held by the Yugoslavs, kicking them literally out. The Female section of the V.G.P.F. was created in 1947, and it was real innovation compared to the old Italian concept of policing. Their tasks were more or less those assigned to the other units, including investigating vice crimes and prostitution. But the ground where they operated with success, was the Social Working. It was the first time that, this professional discipline, that seeks to facilitate the welfare of communities, individuals, families, and groups, was implemented in Italy. There are no records that Female Police Officers were molested, mistreated or that their job was neglected. There is no doubt that the Female Section of the V.G.P.F. was the forerunner for the future introduction of Women into the Italian Police Forces. Female Officers were issued the same uniforms of their male colleagues, but they were not allowed to carry firearms during night shifts.\n\nThe newly formed Police Force also had a chaplain Service, and a Trade Union. The Roman Catholic Mons. Mario Novach served as Corps Chaplain from 1948 until its dissolution in 1961, as most of the Corps member were Roman Catholic and Willy Marcocci was the union secretary.\n\nTransport service, or Truck pool, whose trucks were provided by the military authorities, also included the communication and Road Police Unit. The communication section was in charge of all type of communications, radio, teletype and telephones including the management of the emergency number phone number, 223. The radio center was located into the Local Government House in Piazza/Square Unita' d'Italia. Road Police Unit was responsible for patrolling the roads. In addition to their general road policing duties, they assisted with various operations aimed at improving road safety by promoting campaign for the Road-safety aimed to reduce the rate of road collision in Trieste, and were also in charge to draft reports in case of vehicle collisions.\n\nThe Police Force had its own gazette, \"Il Eco della Polizia\" (\"The Echo of the Police\") whose last issue was on October 25, 1954.\n\nThe V.G.P.F was also involved in the recovering of the corpses from the Foibes, deep karst sinkhole, and the V.G.P.F Criminal Investigation Division was in charge of the investigation. The \"Corpse Recovering Squad\" was part of the forensic section and was led by the Inspectors Umberto De Giorgi and Oronzo Rizzo. The long report drafted by Inspector De Giorgi, pertaining the operation of the corpses recovering from foibes, is available online, in Italian language. During the November 1951 Polesine flooding, when two thirds of the Polesine Italian geographical region was flooded, the V.G.P.F organized a relief party commanded by Superintendent May, a former Metropolitan Police Superintendent, with more than 150 men equipped with: 11 heavy trucks, 10 motorcycle, 11 jeeps, a mobile radio station, 5 light trucks, a water supply truck, an ambulance and a searching-light truck.\n\nThe Police Commissioner was the British Army Colonel CMG, OBE, Gerald Richardson. A Scotland yard Officer, from Nottingham, he had his first experience as Police Officer, when himself and other members of a local rowing club decided to volunteer, for the Special Constabulary in Nottingham, when a general strike broke out. The strike lasted 9 days, from May 3, 1926 to May 13, 1926. At the end of the strike, he had realized that Law enforcement would have been his future career. He applied for the London Metropolitan Police where, after having passing the tests, he was admitted in 1927, and entered in the Police Training School at the Peel House in Westminster. After the graduation he spent 12 months on the beat, and then requested the assignment to the Criminal Investigation department; in August 1929 he was appointed Detective Constable. On July 13, 1943 he was Commissioned into the British Army. He would spend the rest of the war as law enforcement officer in the territories occupied by the British Forces. From London he was initially sent to Tangier, and after the landing in Italy he was in Sicily and Naples where for 18 months, he was Chief Public Safety Officer. At the end of the war he was serving in Northern Italy. It was during a period of rest on lake Maggiore, that an urgent telephone call summoned him, to report immediately, to the 8th Army HQ, where he received a new assignment as Director of the Public Safety of the City of Trieste. His task was not an easy one since there was no existing police force in the city. Among the reasons which had made the allied to take the direct rule of the area was that of, avoiding future confrontation between Italy and Yugoslavia who were still struggling for the possession of the border regions and the Port of Trieste. The port was a strategic hub to supply the allied forces in the occupied Austria. Colonel Gerald Richardson, has been described as a worthy gentleman always well dressed, and with the typical English trait. He tried to infuse the esprit de corps, and to create a cohesion into the newly formed unit. When creating the V.G.P.F, He abolished disciplinary code in use in the Royal Carabineer Corps, judging it too harsh and vicious, encouraged the development of, the new force traditions, personal responsibilities, and the concept of impartiality. Police Force personnel welfare was one of his priorities; he made sure that they all received an adequate salary, appropriate lodging, family allowances, and sickness benefits. However, when a regrettable incident occurred at a village outside Trieste, where a political demonstration had later developed into a riot, was taking place, and three demonstrators were shot dead, three Police Officers and an Inspector were charged with manslaughter, and had to appear before an Allied Military Court presided by British and American judges. As soon as he took up office, one of his first decision was to disband the Difesa Popolare, or Popular Defense, the uniformed People's Police Force the Communists had built up. He soon noticed that, they were keeping no-record of what they were doing as well as for the arrestees, and when asked about it, were not able to produce any record at all; that their prisons were full, and most of the times, the interviewed prisoners could not give an account regarding their arrest. In addition all the evidences he collected, suggested that the Difesa Popolare, was financing itself with a protection racket system and looting. The uniform they wore were done by a local clothing manufacturer who had been doing the same job for the Germans. They wore red stars, and red scarfs around the neck and their chest were trimmed with hand grenades. Col. Gerald Richardson also find out that, their courts had no professional judges and that at the best, the trials were presided by some zealous young Law student, which in most of the cases, had forgotten everything he had studied. All these facts were intolerable for him and for the Allied authorities, and therefore two weeks after he took office the Difesa Popolare was officially disbanded. When they asked for a Victory parade, to be held on Sunday morning, their request was granted. The Difesa Popolare marched thru the street of Trieste, for the last time, and reached the Rossetti barracks. When the last one of them had filed into the barracks, the heavy doors were dragged shut behind them. From the opening windows, and roof British troops covered them with rifles, and machine guns; they had to surrender their own arms. They were told that they could go everywhere they liked, women as well as men. Those who wanted to go to Yugoslavia had to form a line on the left, assuming that the others on the right would have stayed, and were escorted to the frontier. British Personnel quickly went to the Difesa Popolare Posts and seized their weapon. However some of them were also given the chance of joining the V.G.P.F., although Richardson's preference was for the former Royal Carabineers and Questura personnel whom he judged a better training material. His office was located at Foro Ulpiano, inside the Trieste Court House, and also included the Deputy Chief of Police, the Legal Advisor and Disciplinary Officer. In March 1955, Col. Richardson became the Commissaire, Chef de la Sureté, Police Générale, in the International zone of Tangier.\n\nThe Morgan Line ceased to exist on September 15, 1947, when the Treaty of Peace with Italy came into effect. The Treaty established the border between Italy and Yugoslavia in the northern sections of the contended territory, as well as the border between Yugoslavia and the Free Territory of Trieste established as new independent, sovereign State under a provisional regime of Government and under the direct responsibility of the United Nations Security Council in its southern part. The Jurisdiction of the Free Territory of Trieste, after Gorizia and Pola zones had been returned to Italy and ceded Yugoslavia respectively, was divided into 5 Zones: City of Trieste, Duino, Opicina, Muggia and Port and Railway. Zones were divided into Districts open 24/7, and Border Posts. Every zone was patrolled on foot and with Emergency car. A system of public emergency calls was started, and the emergency number 223, was available, to request help or assistance by the local population.\n\nThe V.G.P.F personnel was initially issued a mixture of British, American and Italian equipment and weaponry. The 13th British Army Corps insignia, an Antelope, was adopted as the Corps Insignia. However parade and Police Uniform were under a great British influx, resulting in an undeniable, London Metropolitan Police style. Military training was according to that of the British Army, as well as the drill instruction. The British Army's salute, with the right hand palm facing forwards with the fingers almost touching the cap or beret, was adopted. The corps was equipped with Winchester Carbine mod. 1 and 2, Automatic Colt Pistol cal. 45, Smyth and Wesson revolvers. Commissioned Officers and sergeants were issued Italian Beretta Pistol model 1934. Only night time shifts carried firearms, while during the day no weapons was carried by the personnel on duty. The V.G.P.F identification cards were all bilingual.\n\nSenior Commissioned Officers had a rank tier as follow: Superintendent Assistant, Superintendent and Chief Superintendent. These positions were exclusively held by British and American personnel. Junior Ranks from Deputy Superintendent (Major), Chief Inspector (Captain), Inspector (1st LT), Deputy Inspector (2nd LT), Sergeants (Warrant Officers) of first, second and third class, Corporal and Guard, were open to locals.\n\nThe Venezia-Giulia Police Force in October 1945 had an initial strength of 2,482 Commissioned Officers and enlisted. At its peak, in 1949, had a strength of 6,097 men and women, decreasing to 4,296 in 1952, and in 1954, when the provisional civil administration of zone A of the FTT was eventually handed over to Italy had a total 4,366 men and women. The V.G.P.F. personnel was created following the Venezia-Giulia ethnic criteria enlisting Italians, Slovenians and Croats. In addition a small group of former Germans and Austrians P.O.W were also allow to enlist.\n\nOn November 3, 1953, on the anniversary of the first annexation of Trieste to Italy in 1918, which is also the feast commemorating the Patron Saint of Trieste, Saint Giusto, the city mayor, Giovanni Bartoli, ignoring a ban of Maj. Gen. Sir Thomas John Willoughby Winterton displayed the Italian National flag on the City hall. As he hoisted the flag some British Officers quickly removed and confiscated the flag. The day after, some local citizens coming back from the celebration held at the Redipuglia Italian World War I memorial, improvised a demonstration in support of the Italian rule of the city. The V.G.P.F. was activated to suppress the unauthorized demonstration, and confiscate the flags waved by the demonstrators. This provoked heavy fights which soon spread out throughout the city. On November 5, 1953 the students called a strike and started a demonstration in Sant'Antonio Square, in front of the local church. As a Civil Police car passed by, the students stoned the vehicle. A British member of the V.G.P.F., Mr. Edwards, got off the car and confronted the demonstrators, was greeted with a hail stones, insulted and beaten. The V.G.P.F. Riot squad arrived on the spot,to support the Superintended of C.I.D, Villanti and his men, who had witnessed the scene of Mr. Edwards stoning and went to rescue him. The crowd was soon dispersed with truncheons and with the help of a water truck. Some of the students who had find refuge into the church were chased and seriously beaten. During the afternoon the City Bishop Mons Antonio Santin decided to re-consecrate the church, according to the Roman Catholic tradition, as violent acts have been committed inside. Thousands of citizens rallied up for the rite, and as the Police cars showed up the trouble soon begun. Apparently a British Officer member of the V.G.P.F, fired warning shots, as well as, some Police Officers did. As a result, two persons, Piero Addobbati and Antonio Zavadil were killed and several were injured. On November 6, 1953 a large crowd marched towards the Government house on Piazza/Square, Unità d'Italia were the AMG had its seat. In the meantime cars and other Police facilities in the city were destroyed and burned. The Police cordoning the Government house opened fire killing, Francesco Paglia, Leonardo Manzi, Saverio Montano and Erminio Bassa. In the three days of rioting six persons were killed and 162 injured, including 79 policemen. In his memories, Col. Richardson gave this account of the shooting at Piazza Unità d'Italia, in front of the Government house, …\"Mr Williams was told to go to Piazza Unità d'Italia at the Government house, with a Riot Squad. When there he ordered his men to remain into the vehicles. He went, alone, to remonstrate with the crowd, and in Italian, he appealed to them, but his attempt was unsuccessful. As he went back to his men, several stone struck him, and at that point, since the situation was quickly deteriorating, he gave orders to his men, to unsling carbines and prepare to face the crowd. He led a charge against the mob, meanwhile the Police was under a heavy stone volley. After he had run ahead few yards, he heard shots being fired behind him, but he had given no order to fire.. He immediately turned back and shouted in Italian \" Enough, enough! Stop firing!!!\"\"…\n\nThe victims of the riots were: Francesco Paglia (Trieste, 1929), student at the local University, and former bersagliere of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana; Leonardo \"Nardino\" Manzi (Fiume now Rijeka, 1938), student, a Fiume refugee; Saverio Montano (Bari, 1903), former partisan; Erminio Bassa (Trieste, 1902), Dockworker; Antonio Zavadil (Trieste, 1889), Dockworker; Pietro Addobbati (Zara now Zadar, 1938), student, a Dalmatian region refugee.\n\nClement Attlee, at the time leader of the opposition, (by Private Notice) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Anthony Eden, whether he could make any statement regarding the disturbances in Trieste. Police reports indicated that disorders were deliberately provoked and at least partly organized from outside Zone A, by people defined as \"Irresponsible elements\" who had evidently planned to exploit certain national Italian anniversaries in order to provoke incidents in Trieste. The demonstrations seemed to be aimed at causing a breakdown of law and order and the disruption of the local security forces. Italian sources however labeled the action as a, deliberate repression put into being by the Anglo-American Allied Military Government Authorities, to suppress the Italian sentiment of the local population, and obstruct the process of reunion of Trieste with the motherland. Her Majesty's Government took a grave view of these events, and sincerely deplored the loss of life, the injuries suffered and the destruction of property in Trieste. However the sole responsibility for these tragic results was given to those extremist elements who deliberately provoked and organized these disorders. In note exchanging the British government made its views quite clear to the Italian Government and urged that they should do all in their power to curb those elements who have been responsible for provoking the disturbances in Trieste and the subsequent anti-allied demonstrations in Italy.\n\nApproximately at 10:00 hrs of October 26, 1954 the Venezia-Giulia Police Force Commissioner, Col. Gerald Richardson, handed over responsibilities to Lt. Col. Diamante the acting Chief Public Safety Officer nominated by the Italian authorities. The V.G.P.F. was placed under the authority of the Italian State Police Force, at the time a paramilitary branch of the Italian Security Forces, and renamed, \"Gruppo Polizia Civile\" or \"Civil Police Group\", retaining its uniforms and ranks. This was an unusual status, because the V.G. Police Force was conceived as a Civil Police Force, while Italy had a long tradition, still enduring, of National Police Forces with a Military Status. Deputy Supervisor, Santo Del Piccolo was appointed as Commanding Officer of the \"Civil Police Group\". The Force, continued to operate as semi-distinct branch of Service of the Italian State Police Force, until law number 1600 was passed on December 22, 1960. The law came into effect on July 18, 1961, definitively dissolving the V.G. Police Force. Its personnel was given the choice to join the Italian State Police Force, acquiring a Military status, join the City of Trieste Municipal Force, or entering into the state administration. Some of the V.G.P.F. Personnel, mostly those with English skills, took the chance offered by the Allied, to emigrate under a special program, in USA, Canada, Australia or United Kingdom.\n"}
{"id": "5043637", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5043637", "title": "War in Darfur", "text": "War in Darfur\n\nThe War in Darfur is a major armed conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan that began in February 2003 when the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) rebel groups began fighting the government of Sudan, which they accused of oppressing Darfur's non-Arab population. The government responded to attacks by carrying out a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Darfur's non-Arabs. This resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands of civilians and the indictment of Sudan's president, Omar al-Bashir, for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.\n\nOne side of the conflict is mainly composed of Sudanese military and police and the Janjaweed, a Sudanese militia group whose members are mostly recruited among Arabized indigenous Africans and a small number of Bedouin of the northern Rizeigat; the majority of other Arab groups in Darfur remained uninvolved.\nThe other side is made up of rebel groups, notably the SLM/A and the JEM, recruited primarily from the non-Arab Muslim Fur, Zaghawa, and Masalit ethnic groups. The African Union and the United Nations also have a joint peacekeeping mission in the region, named UNAMID. Although the Sudanese government publicly denies that it supported the Janjaweed, evidence supports claims that it provided financial assistance and weapons and coordinated joint attacks, many against civilians. Estimates of the number of human casualties range up to several hundred thousand dead, from either combat or starvation and disease. Mass displacements and coercive migrations forced millions into refugee camps or across the border, creating a humanitarian crisis. Former US Secretary of State Colin Powell described the situation as a genocide or acts of genocide.\n\nThe Sudanese government and the JEM signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2010, with a tentative agreement to pursue peace. The JEM has the most to gain from the talks and could see semi-autonomy much like South Sudan. However, talks were disrupted by accusations that the Sudanese army launched raids and air strikes against a village, violating the Tolu agreement. The JEM, the largest rebel group in Darfur, vowed to boycott negotiations.\n\nDarfur, Arabic for \"the home of the Fur\", was not a traditional part of the states organized along the upper Nile valley but instead organized as an independent sultanate in the 14th century. Owing to the migration of the Banu Hilal tribe in the 11th century CE, the peoples of the Nile valley became heavily Arabicized while the hinterlands remained closer to native Sudanese cultures. It was first annexed to the Egyptian Sudan in 1875 and then surrendered by its governor Slatin Pasha to the Mahdia in 1883. Following the Anglo-Egyptian victory in the Mahdist War, Sultan Ali Dinar was reinstated as a British client before being deposed by a 1916 expedition after he made overtures in favor of Turkey amid the First World War. Subsequently, Darfur remained a province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the independent Republic of the Sudan.\n\nThere are several different explanations for the origins of the present conflict. One explanation involves the land disputes between semi-nomadic livestock herders and those who practice sedentary agriculture. Water access has also been identified as a major source of the conflict.\nThe Darfur crisis is also related to a second conflict. In southern Sudan, civil war has raged for decades between the northern, Arab-dominated government and Christian and animist black southerners. Yet another origin is conflict between the Islamist, Khartoum-based national government and two rebel groups based in Darfur: the Sudan Liberation Army and the Justice and Equality Movement.\n\nIn early 1991, non-Arabs of the Zaghawa tribe of Sudan attested that they were victims of an intensifying Arab apartheid campaign, segregating Arabs and non-Arabs. Sudanese Arabs, who controlled the government, were widely referred to as practicing apartheid against Sudan's non-Arab citizens. The government was accused of \"deftly manipulat(ing) Arab solidarity\" to carry out policies of apartheid and ethnic cleansing.\n\nAmerican University economist George Ayittey accused the Arab government of Sudan of practicing acts of racism against black citizens. According to Ayittey, \"In Sudan... the Arabs monopolized power and excluded blacks – Arab apartheid.\" Many African commentators joined Ayittey in accusing Sudan of practising Arab apartheid.\n\nAlan Dershowitz labeled Sudan an example of a government that \"actually deserve(s)\" the appellation \"apartheid\". Former Canadian Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler echoed the accusation.\n\nFlint and de Waal marked the onset of the genocide on 26 February 2003, when a group calling itself the Darfur Liberation Front (DLF) publicly claimed credit for an attack on Golo, the headquarters of Jebel Marra District. Prior to this attack, however, conflict had broken out, as rebels attacked police stations, army outposts and military convoys and the government engaged in a massive air and land assault on the rebel stronghold in the Marrah Mountains. The rebels' first military action was a successful attack on an army garrison on 25 February 2002. The government had been aware of a unified rebel movement since an attack on the Golo police station in June 2002. Flint and de Waal date the beginning of the rebellion to 21 July 2001, when a group of Zaghawa and Fur met in Abu Gamra and swore oaths on the Qur'an to work together to defend against government-sponsored attacks on their villages. Nearly all of Darfur's residents are Muslim, including the Janjaweed, as well as government leaders in Khartoum.\n\nOn 25 March 2003, the rebels seized the garrison town of Tine along the Chadian border, seizing large quantities of supplies and arms. Despite a threat by President Omar al-Bashir to \"unleash\" the army, the military had little in reserve. The army was already deployed in both the south, where the Second Sudanese Civil War was drawing to an end, and the east, where rebels sponsored by Eritrea were threatening a newly constructed pipeline from the central oilfields to Port Sudan. The rebel guerilla tactic of hit-and-run raids proved almost impossible for the army, untrained in desert operations, to counter. However, its aerial bombardment of rebel positions on the mountain was devastating.\nAt 5:30 am on 25 April 2003, The Darfur genocide arose when the Sudan Liberation Movement and the JEM, which is the largest rebel group in Darfur, entered Al-Fashir, the capital city of North Darfur and attacked the sleeping garrison. In the next four hours, four Antonov bombers and helicopter gunships (according to the government; seven according to the rebels) were destroyed on the ground, 75 soldiers, pilots and technicians were killed and 32 were captured, including the commander of the air base, a Major General. The success of the raid was unprecedented in Sudan; in the twenty years of the war in the south, the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) had never before carried out such an operation.\n\nThe al-Fashir raid was a turning point, both militarily and psychologically. The armed forces had been humiliated by the raid, placing the government in a difficult strategic situation. The incompetent armed forces needed to be retrained and redeployed amid concerns about the loyalty of the many Darfurian non-commissioned officers and soldiers. Responsibility for prosecuting the war was given to Sudanese military intelligence. Nevertheless, in the middle months of 2003, rebels won 34 of 38 engagements. In May, the SLA destroyed a battalion at Kutum, killing 500 and taking 300 prisoners; in mid-July, 250 were killed in a second attack on Tine. The SLA began to infiltrate farther east, threatening to extend the war into Kordofan.\n\nGiven that the army was consistently losing, the war effort switched to emphasize three elements: military intelligence, the air force and the Janjaweed. The latter were armed Baggara herders whom the government had used to suppress a Masalit uprising from 1986 to 1999. The Janjaweed became the center of the new counter-insurgency strategy. Though the government consistently denied supporting them, military resources were poured into Darfur and the Janjaweed were outfitted as a paramilitary force, complete with communication equipment and some artillery. The military planners were aware of the probable consequences of such a strategy: similar methods undertaken in the Nuba Mountains and around the southern oil fields during the 1990s had resulted in massive human rights violations and forced displacements.\n\nIn 2004, Chad brokered negotiations in N'Djamena, leading to the April 8 Humanitarian Ceasefire Agreement between the Sudanese government, the JEM, and the SLA. One group that did not participate in the April cease-fire talks or agreement, the National Movement for Reform and Development, split from the JEM in April. Janjaweed and rebel attacks continued despite the ceasefire, and the African Union (AU) formed a Ceasefire Commission (CFC) to monitor its observance.\nIn August, the African Union sent 150 Rwandan troops to protect the ceasefire monitors. However, it soon became apparent that 150 troops would not be enough, and they were subsequently joined by 150 Nigerian troops.\n\nOn 18 September the United Nations Security Council issued Resolution 1564 declaring that the Sudan government had not met its commitments and expressing concern at helicopter attacks and assaults by the Janjaweed. It welcomed the intention of the African Union to enhance its monitoring mission and urged all member states to support such efforts.\n\nDuring April 2005, after the Sudan government signed a ceasefire agreement with Sudan People's Liberation Army which led to the end of the Second Sudanese Civil War, the African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) force was increased by 600 troops and 80 military observers. In July, the force was increased by about 3,300 (with a budget of 220 million dollars). In April 2005, AMIS was increased to about 7,000.\n\nThe scale of the crisis led to warnings of an imminent disaster, with United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan warning about the risk of genocide. The scale of the Janjaweed campaign led to comparisons with the Rwandan Genocide, a parallel denied by the Sudanese government. Independent observers noted that the tactics, which included dismemberment and killing of noncombatants, including young children and infants, were more akin to the ethnic cleansing used in the Yugoslav wars and warned that the region's remoteness meant that hundreds of thousands of people were effectively cut off from aid. The Brussels-based International Crisis Group had reported in May 2004 that over 350,000 people could potentially die as a result of starvation and disease.\nOn 10 July 2005, Ex-SPLA leader John Garang was sworn in as Sudan's vice-president. However, on 30 July, Garang died in a helicopter crash. Despite improved security, talks between the various rebels in the Darfur region progressed slowly.\n\nAn attack on the Chadian town of Adré near the Sudanese border led to the death of 300 rebels in December. Sudan was blamed for the attack, which was the second in the region in three days. Escalating tensions led the government of Chad to declare its hostility toward Sudan and to call for Chadians to mobilise against the \"common enemy\". (See Chad-Sudan conflict)\n\nOn 5 May 2006, the Sudanese government signed the Darfur Peace Agreement along with the faction of the SLA led by Minni Minnawi. However, the agreement was rejected by the smaller Justice and Equality Movement and a rival faction of the SLA led by Abdul Wahid al Nur. The accord was orchestrated by chief negotiator Salim Ahmed Salim (working on behalf of the African Union), U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert B. Zoellick, AU representatives and other foreign officials operating in Abuja, Nigeria.\n\nThe 115-page agreement included agreements on national and state power-sharing, demilitarization of the Janjaweed and other militias, an integration of SLM/A and JEM troops into the Sudanese Armed Forces and police, a system of federal wealth-sharing for the promotion of Darfurian economic interests, a referendum on the future status of Darfur and measures to promote the flow of humanitarian aid.\n\nRepresentatives of the African Union, Nigeria, Libya, the USA, the UK, the UN, the EU, the Arab League, Egypt, Canada, Norway and the Netherlands served as witnesses.\n\nJuly and August 2006 saw renewed fighting, with international aid organizations considering leaving due to attacks against their personnel. Annan called for 18,000 international peacekeepers in Darfur to replace the 7,000-man AMIS force. In one incident at Kalma, seven women, who ventured out of a refugee camp to gather firewood, were gang-raped, beaten and robbed by the Janjaweed. When they had finished, the attackers stripped them naked and jeered at them as they fled.\n\nIn a private meeting on 18 August, Hédi Annabi, Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, warned that Sudan appeared to be preparing for a major military offensive. The warning came a day after UN Commission on Human Rights special investigator Sima Samar stated that Sudan's efforts remained poor despite the May Agreement. On 19 August, Sudan reiterated its opposition to replacing AMIS with a UN force, resulting in the US issuing a \"threat\" to Sudan over the \"potential consequences\".\n\nOn 25 August, Sudan rejected attending a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting to explain its plan to send 10,000 Sudanese soldiers to Darfur instead of the proposed 20,000 UN peacekeeping force. The Security Council announced it would hold the meeting despite Sudan's absence. Also on 24 August, the International Rescue Committee reported that hundreds of women were raped and sexually assaulted around the Kalma refugee camp during the previous several weeks and that the Janjaweed were reportedly using rape to cause women to be humiliated and ostracised by their own communities. On 25 August, the head of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of African Affairs, Assistant Secretary Jendayi Frazer, warned that the region faced a security crisis unless the UN peacekeeping force deployed.\n\nOn 26 August, two days before the UNSC meeting and Frazer was due to arrive in Khartoum, Paul Salopek, a U.S. \"National Geographic Magazine\" journalist, appeared in court in Darfur facing charges of espionage; he had crossed into the country illegally from Chad, circumventing the Sudanese government's official restrictions on foreign journalists. He was later released after direct negotiation with President al-Bashir. This came a month after Tomo Križnar, a Slovenian presidential envoy, was sentenced to two years in prison for spying.\n\nOn 31 August 2006, the UNSC approved a resolution to send a new peacekeeping force of 17,300 to the region. Sudan expressed strong opposition to the resolution. On 1 September, African Union officials reported that Sudan had launched a major offensive in Darfur, killing more than 20 people and displacing over 1,000. On 5 September, Sudan asked the existing AU force to leave by the end of the month, adding that \"they have no right to transfer this assignment to the United Nations or any other party. This right rests with the government of Sudan.\" On 4 September, in a move not viewed as surprising, Chad's president Idriss Déby voiced support for the UN peacekeeping force. The AU, whose mandate expired on 30 September 2006, confirmed that AMIS would leave. The next day, however, a senior US State Department official told reporters that the AU force might remain past the deadline.\n\nOn 8 September, António Guterres, head of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said Darfur faced a \"humanitarian catastrophe\". On 12 September, Sudan's European Union envoy Pekka Haavisto claimed that the Sudanese army was \"bombing civilians in Darfur\". A World Food Programme official reported that food aid had been blocked from reaching at least 355,000 people. Annan said, \"the tragedy in Darfur has reached a critical moment. It merits this council's closest attention and urgent action.\"\n\nOn 14 September, the leader of the Sudan Liberation Movement, Minni Minnawi, stated that he did not object to the UN peacekeeping force, rejecting the Sudanese government's view that such a deployment would be an act of Western invasion. Minnawi claimed that AMIS \"can do nothing because the AU mandate is very limited\". Khartoum remained opposed to UN involvement, with Al-Bashir depicting it as a colonial plan and stating that \"we do not want Sudan to turn into another Iraq.\"\n\nOn 2 October the AU announced that it would extend its presence until 31 December 2006. Two hundred UN troops were sent to reinforce the AU force. On 6 October, the UNSC voted to extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission in Sudan until 30 April 2007. On 9 October, the Food and Agriculture Organization listed Darfur as the most pressing food emergency out of the forty countries listed on its \"Crop Prospects and Food Situation\" report. On 10 October, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Louise Arbour, claimed that the Sudanese government had prior knowledge of attacks by Janjaweed militias in Buram, South Darfur the month before, in which hundreds of civilians were killed.\nOn 12 October, Nigerian Foreign Minister Joy Ogwu arrived in Darfur for a two-day visit. She urged the Sudanese government to accept the UN proposal. Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo spoke against \"stand[ing] by and see[ing] genocide taking place in Darfur.\" On 13 October, US President George W. Bush imposed further sanctions against those deemed complicit in the atrocities under the \"Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006\". The measures were said to strengthen existing sanctions by prohibiting US citizens from engaging in oil-related transactions with Sudan (although US companies had been prohibited from doing business with Sudan since 1997), freezing the assets of complicit parties and denying them entry to the US.\n\nThe lack of funding and equipment for the AU mission meant that the work of aid workers in Darfur was severely limited by fighting. Some warned that the humanitarian situation could deteriorate to levels seen in 2003 and 2004, when UN officials called Darfur the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nOn 22 October, the Sudan government told UN envoy Jan Pronk to leave the country within three days. Pronk, the senior UN official in the country, had been heavily criticized by the Sudanese army after he posted a description of several recent military defeats in Darfur to his personal blog. On 1 November, the US announced that it would formulate an international plan which it hoped the Sudanese government would find more palatable. On 9 November, senior Sudanese presidential advisor Nafie Ali Nafie told reporters that his government was prepared to start unconditional talks with the National Redemption Front (NRF) rebel alliance, but noted he saw little use for a new peace agreement. The NRF, which had rejected the May Agreement and sought a new peace agreement, did not comment.\n\nIn late 2006, Darfur Arabs started their own rebel group, the Popular Forces Troops, and announced on 6 December that they had repulsed an assault by the Sudanese army at Kas-Zallingi the previous day. They were the latest of numerous Darfur Arab groups to oppose the government since 2003, some of which had signed political accords with rebel movements.\n\nThe same period saw an example of a tribe-based split within the Arab forces, when relations between the farming Terjem and nomadic, camel-herding Mahria tribes became tense. Terjem leaders accused the Mahria of kidnapping a Terjem boy, while Mahria leaders said the Terjem had been stealing their animals. Ali Mahamoud Mohammed, the wali, or governor, of South Darfur, said the fighting began in December when the Mahria drove their camels south in a seasonal migration, trampling through Terjem territory near the Bulbul River. Fighting resumed in July 2007.\n\nOn 17 November reports of a potential deal to place a \"compromise peacekeeping force\" in Darfur were announced, but would later appear to have been rejected by Sudan. The UN claimed on 18 November that Sudan had agreed to the deployment of UN peacekeepers. Sudan's Foreign Minister Lam Akol stated that \"there should be no talk about a mixed force\" and that the UN's role should be restricted to technical support. Also on 18 November, the AU reported that Sudanese military and Sudanese-backed militias had launched a ground and air operation in the region that resulted in about 70 civilian deaths. The AU stated that this \"was a flagrant violation of security agreements\".\n\nOn 25 November a spokesperson for UN High Commissioner for Human Rights accused the Sudanese government of having committed \"a deliberate and unprovoked attack\" against civilians in Sirba on 11 November, which claimed the lives of at least 30 people. The Commissioner's statement maintained that \"contrary to the government’s claim, it appears that the Sudanese Armed Forces launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on civilians and their property in Sirba,\" and that this also involved \"extensive and wanton destruction and looting of civilian property\".\n\nAccording to the Save Darfur Coalition, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson and al-Bashir agreed to a cease-fire whereby the Sudanese \"government and rebel groups will cease hostilities for a period of 60 days while they work towards a lasting peace.\" In addition, the Save Darfur press release stated that the agreement \"included a number of concessions to improve humanitarian aid and media access to Darfur.\" Despite the formality of a ceasefire there have been further media reports of killings and other violence. On Sunday 15 April 2007, African Union peacekeepers were targeted and killed. \"The New York Times\" reported that \"a confidential United Nations report says the government of Sudan is flying arms and heavy military equipment into Darfur in violation of Security Council resolutions and painting Sudanese military planes white to disguise them as United Nations or African Union aircraft.\"\n\nOn 31 March 2007 Janjaweed militiamen killed up to 400 people in the eastern border region of Chad near Sudan. The border villages of Tiero and Marena were encircled and then fired upon. The women were robbed and the men shot according to the UNHCR. Many of those who survived the initial attack, ended up dying due to exhaustion and dehydration, often while fleeing. On 14 April 2007, more attacks were reported by the UNHCR in Tiero and Marena.\n\nOn 18 April President Bush gave a speech at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum criticizing the Sudanese government and threatened further sanctions if the situation did not improve.\n\nSudan's humanitarian affairs minister, Ahmed Haroun, and a Janjaweed militia leader, known as Ali Kushayb, were charged by the International Criminal Court with 51 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Ahmed Haroun said he \"did not feel guilty,\" his conscience was clear, and that he was ready to defend himself.\n\nAl-Bashir and Deby signed a peace agreement on 3 May 2007 aimed at reducing tension between their countries. The accord was brokered by Saudi Arabia. It asserted that neither country would harbor, train or fund armed movements opposed to the other. Reuters reported that \"Deby's fears that Nouri's UFDD may have been receiving Saudi as well as Sudanese support could have pushed him to sign the Saudi-mediated pact with Bashir\". Colin Thomas-Jensen, an expert on Chad and Darfur at the International Crisis Group think-tank expressed doubts as to whether \"this new deal will lead to any genuine thaw in relations or improvement in the security situation\". Chadian rebel Union of Forces for Democracy and Development (UFDD) which had fought a hit-and-run war against Deby's forces in eastern Chad since 2006, stated that the Saudi-backed peace deal would not stop its military campaign.\n\nOxfam announced on 17 June that it would permanently pull out of Gereida, the largest refugee camp, holding more than 130,000. The agency cited inaction by local authorities from the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM), which controls the region, in addressing security concerns and violence against aid workers. An employee of the NGO Action by Churches Together was murdered in June in West Darfur. Vehicle hijackings also made them consider leaving.\n\nBBC News reported that a huge underground lake had been found. This find could eliminate the competition for water resources.\n\nFrance and Britain announced they would push for a UN resolution to dispatch African Union and United Nations peacekeepers to Darfur and would push for an immediate cease-fire in Darfur and are prepared to provide \"substantial\" economic aid \"as soon as a cease-fire makes it possible.\"\n\nA 14 July 2007 article noted that in the past two months up to 75,000 Arabs from Chad and Niger had crossed into Darfur. Most have been relocated by Sudanese government to former villages of displaced non-Arab people.\n\nA hybrid UN/AU force was finally approved on 31 July with the unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 1769. UNAMID was to take over from AMIS by 31 December at the latest, and haf an initial mandate up to 31 July 2008.\n\nOn 31 July, Mahria gunmen surrounded mourners at the funeral of an important Terjem sheik and killed 60 with rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) and belt-fed machine guns.\n\nFrom 3–5 August a conference was held in Arusha to unite the rebel groups to streamline the subsequent peace negotiations with the government. Most senior rebel leaders attended, with the notable exception of Abdul Wahid al Nur, who headed a rather small splinter group of the SLA/M that he had initially founded in 2003, was considered to be the representatives of a large part of the displaced Fur people. His absence was damaging to the peace talks. International officials stated that there is \"no John Garang in Darfur\", referring to the leader of the negotiating team of South Sudan, who was universally accepted by the various South Sudanese rebel groups.\n\nThe participants were Gamali Galaleiddine, Khalil Abdalla Adam, Salah Abu Surra, Khamis Abdallah Abakar, Ahmed Abdelshafi, Abdalla Yahya, Khalil Ibrahim (of the Justice and Equality Movement) and Ahmed Ibrahim Ali Diraige. Closed-door meetings between the AU-UN and rebel leaders, as well as among rebel leaders took place. Eight more participants arrived on 4 August (including Jar el-Neby, Salah Adam Isaac and Suleiman Marajan), while the SLM Unity faction boycotted the talks because the Sudanese government had threatened to arrest Suleiman Jamous if he left the hospital. The rebel leaders aimed to unify their positions and demands, which included compensation for the victims and autonomy for Darfur. They eventually reached agreement on joint demands, including power and wealth sharing, security, land and humanitarian issues.\n\nIn the months through August, Arab tribes that had worked together in the Janjaweed militia began falling out among themselves, and further splintered. Thousands of Terjem and Mahria gunmen traveled hundreds of miles to fight in the strategic Bulbul river valley. Farther south, Habanniya and Salamat tribes clashed. The fighting did not result in as much killing as in 2003 and 2004. United Nations officials said the groups might be trying to seize land before peacekeepers arrived.\n\nOn 18 September, JEM stated that if the peace talks with Khartoum should fail, they would step up their demands from self-determination to independence.\n\nOn 30 September, the rebels overran an AMIS base, killing at least 12 peacekeepers in \"the heaviest loss of life and biggest attack on the African Mission\" during a raid at the end of Ramadan season.\nPeace talks started on 27 October in Sirte, Libya. The following groups attended:\n\n\nThe following groups did not attend:\n\nFaced with a boycott from the most important rebel factions, the talks were rebranded as an \"advanced consultation phase\", with official talks likely to start in November or December.\n\nOn 15 November, nine rebel groups – six SLM factions, the Democratic Popular Front, the Sudanese Revolutionary Front and the Justice and Equality Movement–Field Revolutionary Command – signed a Charter of Unification and agreed to operate under the name of SLM/A henceforth. On 30 November it was announced that Darfur's rebel movements had united into two large groups and were now ready to negotiate in an orderly manner with the government.\n\nA fresh government/militia offensive trapped thousands of refugees along the Chadian border, the rebels and humanitarian workers said on 20 February.\nAs of 21 February, the total dead in Darfur stood at 450,000 with an estimated 3,245,000 people displaced.\n\nOn 10 May 2008 Sudanese government soldiers and Darfur rebels clashed in the city of Omdurman, opposite the capital of Khartoum, over the control of a military headquarters. They also raided a police base from which they stole police vehicles. A Sudanese police spokesperson said that the leader of the assailants, Mohamed Saleh Garbo, and his intelligence chief, Mohamed Nur Al-Deen, were killed in the clash.\n\nWitnesses said that heavy gunfire could be heard in the west of Sudan's capital. Sudanese troops backed by tanks, artillery, and helicopter gunships were immediately deployed to Omdurman, and fighting raged for several hours. After seizing the strategic military airbase at Wadi-Sayedna, the Sudanese soldiers eventually defeated the rebels. A JEM force headed to the Al-Ingaz bridge to cross the White Nile into Khartoum. By late afternoon, Sudanese TV claimed that the rebels had been \"completely repulsed\", while showing live images of burnt vehicles and corpses on the streets.\n\nThe government imposed a curfew in Khartoum from 5 pm to 6 am, while aid agencies told their workers in the capital to stay indoors.\nSome 93 soldiers and 13 policemen were killed along with 30 civilians in the attack on Khartoum and Omdurman. Sudanese forces confirmed that they found the bodies of 90 rebels and had spotted dozens more strewn outside the city limits. While Sudanese authorities claimed that up to 400 rebels could have been killed, the rebels stated that they lost 45 fighters dead or wounded. Sudanese authorities also claimed to have destroyed 40 rebel vehicles and captured 17.\n\nGeneral Martin Agwai, head of the joint African Union-United Nations mission in Darfur, said the war was over in the region, although low-level disputes remained. There was still \"Banditry, localised issues, people trying to resolve issues over water and land at a local level. But real war as such, I think we are over that,\" he said.\n\nIn December 2010, representatives of the Liberation and Justice Movement, an umbrella organisation of ten rebel groups formed in February 2010, started a fresh round of talks with the Sudanese Government in Doha. A new rebel group, the Sudanese Alliance Resistance Forces in Darfur was formed and JEM planned further talks. Talks ended on 19 December with agreement only on basic principles; these included a regional authority and a referendum on autonomy. The possibility of a Darfuri Vice-President was discussed.\n\nIn January 2011, the leader of the Liberation and Justice Movement, Dr. Tijani Sese, stated that the movement had accepted the core proposals of the Darfur peace document as proposed by the mediators in Doha. The proposals included a $300,000,000 compensation package for victims of atrocities in Darfur and special courts to conduct trials of persons accused of human rights violations. Proposals for a new Darfur Regional Authority were included. This authority would have an executive council of 18 ministers and would remain in place for five years. The current three Darfur states and state governments would continue to exist during this period. In February, the Sudanese Government rejected the idea of a single region headed by a vice-president from the region.\n\nOn 29 January, the LJM and JEM leaders issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to the Doha negotiations and intention to attend the Doha forum on 5 February. The Sudanese government postponed decision to attend the forum due to beliefs that an internal peace process without the involvement of rebel groups might be possible. Later in February, the Sudanese Government agreed to return to Doha with a view to complete a new peace agreement by the end of that month. On 25 February, both LJM and JEM announced that they had rejected the peace document proposed by the mediators in Doha. The main sticking points were the issues of a Darfuri vice-president and compensation for victims. The Sudanese government did not comment on the peace document.\n\nOn 9 March, it was announced that two more states would be established in Darfur: Central Darfur around Zalingei and Eastern Darfur around Ed Daein. The rebel groups protested and stated that this was a bid to further divide Darfur's influence.\n\nAdvising both the LJM and JEM during the Doha peace negotiations was the Public International Law & Policy Group (PILPG). Led by Dr. Paul Williams and Matthew T. Simpson, PILPG's team provided legal support.\n\nIn June, a new Darfur Peace Agreement (2011) was proposed by the Doha mediators. This agreement was to supersede the Abuja Agreement of 2005 and when signed, would halt preparations for a Darfur status referendum. The proposed document included provisions for a Darfuri Vice-President and an administrative structure that included three states and a strategic regional authority, the Darfur Regional Authority. The agreement was signed by the Government of Sudan and the Liberation and Justice Movement on 14 July 2011.\n\nLittle progress occurred after September 2012 and the situation slowly worsened and violence was escalating. The population of displaced Sudanese in IDP camps also increased.\n\nA donors conference in Doha pledged US$3.6 billion to help rebuild Darfur. The conference was criticised in the region that the Sudan Liberation Army (Minni Minnawi) rebels had taken. According to the group's Hussein Minnawi, Ashma village and another town were close to the South Darfur capital of Nyala.\n\nOn 27 April, following weeks of fighting, a coalition that included SLA and JEM said that they had taken Um Rawaba in North Kordofan, outside Darfur, and that they were headed for Khartoum to topple the president. The head of an SLA faction, Abdel Wahid Mohammed al-Nur, called it \"a significant shift in the war\". An estimated 300,000 were displaced by violence from January through May.\n\nIn North Darfur, the Rezeigat tribe and the Beni Hussein group signed a peace deal during July after an eruption of violence between the two groups killed hundreds. Later in July, the Misseriya and Salamat Arab tribes announced a ceasefire after battles killed over 200 people. The UN security counsel also announced a review of its UNAMID mission.\n\nDuring the first week of August, the Maalia claimed the Rezeigat had killed five members of their tribe in the southeastern region of Adila. They responded by seizing 400 Rizeigat cattle on 6 August. Community leaders intervened to prevent escalation. When the Maalia failed to return the cattle, violence broke out on 10 August. The Rezeigat attacked and reportedly destroyed a Maaliya compound. In the battle, 77 Maaliya and 36 Rezeigat were killed, and another 200 people were injured. Both sides said Land Cruiser vehicles were used in the battle. The Maaliya accused the Rezeigat of attacking and burning villages while employing \"heavy weaponry\". On 11 August, the fighting spread to several other areas in southeastern Darfur. The violence reportedly arose over a land dispute.\n\nOn 19 March, peacekeepers said they had received recent reports of villages that were attacked and burned after the UN expressed concern over the increasing number of internally displaced persons. UNAMID said that the attacks were in Hashaba, about 100 kilometers north-west of the city Al-Fashir, the state capital of North Darfur.\n\nIn November, local media reported that 200 women and girls had been raped by Sudanese soldiers in Tabit. Sudan denied it and did not permit the UN (who said their first inquiry was inconclusive \"in part due to the heavy presence of military and police\") to make another. An investigation by Human Rights Watch (HRW) released in February said 221 were raped by government soldiers in \"a mass rape that could constitute crimes against humanity\". Witnesses reported three separate operations were carried out in one and a half days. Property was looted, men arrested, residents beaten and women and girls raped. Most of the town's population are Fur people. It had been controlled by rebel forces previously but HRW found no evidence that the rebel fighters were in or close to the village when it was attacked.\n\n3,300 villages were destroyed in 2014 in attacks on civilians according to the UN Panel of Experts. Government forces or those aligned with them were behind most attacks. There were more than 400,000 attacks during the first ten months of the year. The report said that it was \"highly probable that civilian communities were targeted as a result of their actual or perceived affiliations with armed opposition groups\" and that \"such attacks were carried out with impunity\".\n\nIn September 2016, the Sudanese government reportedly launched chemical weapon attacks on civilian populations in Darfur, killing at least 250 people; the majority of the victims were children. It is believed that the munitions contained mustard gas or other blister agents.\n\nReports from UNAMID and the African Center for Justice and Peace Studies suggest that low-level violence continued in Darfur through early 2018, with Sudanese government forces attacking communities in the Jebel Marra area. As UNAMID forces began to be drawn down with an eye to exiting Darfur, there were competing views on the levels of unrest in the region: UN officials pointed to a significant reduction in the scale and distribution of violence in Darfur , while other NGOS such as HRW highlighted persistent pockets of unrest.\n\nThe well armed Janjaweed quickly gained an advantage over rebel factions. By the spring of 2004, several thousand people – mostly from the non-Arab population – had been killed and as many as a million more had been driven from their homes, causing a major humanitarian crisis. The crisis took on an international dimension when over 100,000 refugees poured into neighboring Chad, pursued by militiamen who clashed with Chadian government forces along the border. More than 70 militiamen and 10 Chadian soldiers were killed in one gun battle in April. A United Nations observer team reported that non-Arab villages were singled out, while Arab villages were left untouched:\n\nThe 23 Fur villages in the Shattaya Administrative Unit have been completely depopulated, looted and burnt to the ground (the team observed several such sites driving through the area for two days). Meanwhile, dotted alongside these charred locations are unharmed, populated and functioning Arab settlements. In some locations, the distance between a destroyed Fur village and an Arab village is less than 500 meters.\n\nA 2011 study examined 1,000 interviews with black African participants who fled from 22 village clusters to various refugee camps in 2003 and 2004. The study found: 1) the frequency of hearing racial epithets during an attack was 70% higher when it was led by the Janjaweed alone compared to official police forces; it was 80% higher when the Janjaweed and the Sudanese Government attacked together; 2) the risk of displacement was nearly 110% higher during a joint attack compared to when the police or Janjaweed acted alone, and 85% higher when Janjaweed forces attacked alone compared to when the attack was only perpetrated by government forces; 3) attacks on food and water supplies made it 129% more likely for inhabitants to be displaced compared to attacks that involved house burnings or killings; 4) perpetrators knew and took \"special advantage\" of the susceptibility of Darfur residents to attacks focused on basic resources. This vulnerability came against the backdrop of increased regional desertification.\n\nImmediately after the Janjaweed entered the conflict, the rape of women and young girls, often by multiple militiamen and often throughout entire nights, began to be reported at a staggering rate. Children as young as 2 years old were reported victims, while mothers were assaulted in front of their children. Young women were attacked so violently that they were unable to walk following the attack.\n\nNon-Arab people were reportedly raped by Janjaweed militiamen as a result of the Sudanese government's goal of completely eliminating the presence of black Africans and non-Arabs from Darfur. The Washington Post Foreign Service interviewed verified victims of the rapes and recorded that Arabic terms such as \"abid\" and \"zurga\" were used, which mean slave and black. One victim, Sawelah Suliman, was told by her assailant, \"Black girl, you are too dark. You are like a dog. We want to make a light baby.\" In an 88-page report, victims from Darfur have also accused the Rapid Support Forces of rape and assault as recently as 2015.\n\nMultiple casualty estimates have been published since the war began, ranging from roughly 10,000 civilians (Sudan government) to hundreds of thousands.\n\nIn September 2004, the World Health Organization estimate that there had been 50,000 deaths in Darfur since the beginning of the conflict, an 18-month period, mostly due to starvation. An updated estimate the following month put the number of deaths for the 6-month period from March to October 2004 due to starvation and disease at 70,000; These figures were criticized, because they only considered short periods and did not include deaths from violence. A more recent British Parliamentary Report estimated that over 300,000 people had died, and others have estimated even more.\n\nIn March 2005, the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland estimated that 10,000 were dying each month excluding deaths due to ethnic violence. An estimated 2.7 million people had at that time been displaced from their homes, mostly seeking refuge in camps in Darfur's major towns. Two hundred thousand had fled to neighboring Chad. Reports of violent deaths compiled by the UN indicate between 6,000 and 7,000 fatalities from 2004 to 2007.\n\nIn May 2005, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters (CRED) of the School of Public Health of the Université catholique de Louvain in Brussels, Belgium published an analysis of mortality in Darfur. Their estimate stated that from September 2003 to January 2005, between 98,000 and 181,000 persons had died in Darfur, including 63,000 to 146,000 excess deaths.\n\nIn August 2010, Dr. Eric Reeves argued that total mortality from all violent causes, direct and indirect, at that point in the conflict, exceeded 500,000. His analysis took account of all previous mortality data and studies, including that by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disaster.\n\nThe UN disclosed on 22 April 2008 that it might have underestimated the Darfur death toll by nearly 50%.\n\nIn July 2009, \"The Christian Science Monitor\" published an op-ed stating that many of the published mortality rates have been misleading because they include a large number of people who had died of disease and malnutrition, as well as those who died from direct violence.\n\nIn January 2010, the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters published an article in a special issue of \"The Lancet\". The article, entitled \"Patterns of mortality rates in Darfur conflict\", estimated with 95% confidence that the excess number of deaths is between 178,258 and 461,520 (with a mean of 298,271), with 80% of these due to disease.\n\nInternational attention to the Darfur genocide largely began with reports by Amnesty International in July 2003 and the International Crisis Group in December 2003. However, widespread media coverage did not start until the outgoing United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, Mukesh Kapila, called Darfur the \"world's greatest humanitarian crisis\" in March 2004. Organizations such as , later under the umbrella of Genocide Intervention Network, and the Save Darfur Coalition emerged and became particularly active in the areas of engaging the United States Congress and President on the issue and pushing for divestment, initially launched by Adam Sterling under the auspices of the Sudan Divestment Task Force.\nIn May 2009 the Mandate Darfur was canceled because the \"Sudanese government is obstructing the safe passage of Darfurian delegates from Sudan.\" The Mandate was a conference that would have brought together 300 representatives from different regions of Darfur's civil society. The conference planned was to be held in Addis Ababa sometime in early May.\n\nIn March 2005, the UN Security Council formally referred the situation in Darfur to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, taking into account the report of the International Commission of Inquiry on Darfur, authorized by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1564 of 2004, but without mentioning specific crimes. Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States and China, abstained from the vote on the referral resolution.\n\nIn April 2007, the Judges of the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against the former Minister of State for the Interior, Ahmed Haroun, and a Janjaweed leader, Ali Kushayb, for crimes against humanity and war crimes. The Sudan Government said that the ICC had no jurisdiction to try Sudanese citizens and that it would not surrender the two men.\n\nOn 14 July 2008, the Prosecutor filed ten charges of war crimes against Sudan's incumbent President Omar al-Bashir, including three counts of genocide, five of crimes against humanity and two of murder. The Prosecutor claimed that Mr. al-Bashir \"masterminded and implemented a plan to destroy in substantial part\" three tribal groups in Darfur because of their ethnicity. Leaders from three Darfur tribes sued ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo for libel, defamation, and igniting hatred and tribalism.\n\nAfter an arrest warrant was issued for the Sudanese president in March 2009, the Prosecutor appealed to add genocide charges. However, the Pre-Trial Chamber found that there was no reasonable ground to support the contention that he had a specific intent to commit genocide (\"dolus specialis\"), which is an intention to destroy, in whole or in part, a protected group. The definition adopted by the Pre-Trial Chamber is the definition of the Genocide Convention, the Rome Statute, and some ICTY cases. On 3 February 2010 the Appeals Chamber of the ICC found that the Pre-Trial Chamber had applied \"an erroneous standard of proof when evaluating the evidence submitted by the Prosecutor\" and that the Prosecutor's application for a warrant of arrest on the genocide charges should be sent back to the Pre-Trial Chamber to review based on the correct legal standard. In July 2010, al-Bashir was charged with three counts of genocide in Darfur by the International Criminal Court for orchestrating the Darfur genocide.\n\nAl-Bashir was the first incumbent head of state charged with crimes under the Rome Statute. He rejected the charges and said, \"Whoever has visited Darfur, met officials and discovered their ethnicities and tribes ... will know that all of these things are lies.\"\n\nIt is expected that al-Bashir will not face trial in The Hague until he is apprehended in a nation which accepts ICC jurisdiction, as Sudan is not a party to the Rome Statute, which it signed but did not ratify. Payam Akhavan, a professor of international law at McGill University in Montreal and a former war crimes prosecutor, says although he may not go to trial, \"He will effectively be in prison within the Sudan itself...Al-Bashir now is not going to be able to leave the Sudan without facing arrest.\" The Prosecutor warned that authorities could arrest the President if he enters international airspace. The Sudanese government has announced that the Presidential plane would be accompanied by jet fighters. However, the Arab League announced solidarity with al-Bashir. Since the warrant, he has visited Qatar and Egypt. The African Union also condemned the charges.\n\nSome analysts think that the ICC indictment is counterproductive and harms the peace process. Only days after the ICC indictment, al-Bashir expelled 13 international aid organizations from Darfur and disbanded three domestic aid organizations. In the aftermath of the expulsions, conditions in the displaced camps deteriorated. Previous ICC indictments, such as the arrest warrants of the LRA leadership in the ongoing war in northern Uganda, were also accused of harming peace processes by criminalizing one side of a war.\n\nAl-Bashir sought the assistance of non-western countries after the West, led by America, imposed sanctions against him. He said, \"From the first day, our policy was clear: To look eastward, toward China, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, and even Korea and Japan, even if the Western influence upon some [of these] countries is strong. We believe that the Chinese expansion was natural because it filled the space left by Western governments, the United States, and international funding agencies. The success of the Sudanese experiment in dealing with China without political conditions or pressures encouraged other African countries to look toward China.\"\n\nIn 2007, Amnesty International issued a report accusing China and Russia of supplying arms, ammunition and related equipment to Sudan, some of which the government may have transferred to Darfur in violation of a UN arms embargo. The report claims that Sudan imported 10-20 combat aircraft from China in the early-mid-2000s, including three A-5 Fantan fighters that have been sighted in Darfur. The report provides evidence that the Sudan Air Force conducted indiscriminate aerial bombings of villages in Darfur and eastern Chad using ground attack fighters and repurposed Antonov transport planes. However, it does not specify whether the ground attack fighters in question are those purchased from China in the early-mid-2000s, and the Antonovs' origin remains unclear. The report also lists seven Soviet- or Russian-made Mi-24 Hind gunships that had been deployed to Darfur, though without specifying which country sold them to Sudan, or when. While noting that Russia sold arms worth tens of millions of dollars to Sudan in 2005 alone, the report does not specifically identify any weapons sold to Sudan by Russia after the outbreak of the Darfur conflict or after the imposition of the UNSC ban on arms transfers to Darfur, and it does not provide any evidence that any such weapons were deployed to Darfur.\n\nThe NGO Human Rights First claimed that over 90% of the light weapons currently being imported by Sudan and used in the conflict are from China. Human rights advocates and opponents of the Sudanese government portray China's role in providing weapons and aircraft as a cynical attempt to obtain oil, just as colonial powers once supplied African chieftains with the military means to maintain control as they extracted natural resources. According to China's critics, China threatened to use its veto on the U.N. Security Council to protect Khartoum from sanctions and was able to water down every resolution on Darfur in order to protect its interests. Accusations of the supply of weapons from China, which were then transferred to Darfur by the Sudanese government in violation of the UN arms embargo, continued in 2010.\n\nSarah Wykes, a senior campaigner at Global Witness, an NGO that campaigns for better natural resource governance, says: \"Sudan has purchased about $100m in arms from China and has used these weapons against civilians in Darfur.\"\n\nAccording to the report Following the Thread: Arms and Ammunition Tracing in Sudan and South Sudan, released in May 2014 by the Swiss research group Small Arms Survey, \"Over the period 2001–12, Khartoum’s reports to UN Comtrade reveal significant fluctuation in annual conventional arms imports. The majority of the Sudanese government’s total self-reported imports of small arms and light weapons, their ammunition, and ‘conventional weapons’ over the period originated in China (58 per cent), followed by Iran (13 per cent), St. Vincent and the Grenadines (9 per cent), and Ukraine (8 per cent).\" The report found that Chinese weapons were pervasive among most parties to the Sudanese conflicts, including the war in Darfur, but identified few if any weapons of Russian origin. (The section \"Chinese weapons and ammunition\" receives 20 pages in the report, whereas the only mention of Russian arms is to be found in the sentence \"the majority of...mines [in South Sudan] have been of Chinese and Soviet/Russian origin.\").\n\nChina and Russia denied they had broken UN sanctions. China has a close relationship with Sudan and increased its military co-operation with the government in early 2007. Because of Sudan's plentiful supply of oil, China considers good relations with Sudan to be a strategic necessity. China has direct commercial interests in Sudan's oil. China’s state-owned company CNPC controls between 60 and 70 percent of Sudan’s total oil production. Additionally, it owns the largest single share (40 percent) of Sudan's national oil company, Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company. China consistently opposed economic and non-military sanctions on Sudan.\n\nIn March 2007, threats of boycotting the Olympic games came from French presidential candidate François Bayrou, in an effort to stop China's support. Sudan divestment efforts concentrated on PetroChina, the national petroleum company with extensive investments in Sudan.\n\nGérard Prunier, a scholar specializing in African conflicts, argued that the world's most powerful countries have limited themselves to expressing concern and demand for the United Nations to take action. The UN, lacking funding and military support of the wealthy countries, initially left the African Union to deploy a token force without a mandate to protect civilians.\n\nOn 16 October 2006, Minority Rights Group (MRG) published a critical report, challenging that the UN and the great powers could have prevented the crisis and that few lessons appeared to have been drawn from the Rwandan Genocide. MRG's executive director, Mark Lattimer, stated that: \"this level of crisis, the killings, rape and displacement could have been foreseen and avoided ... Darfur would just not be in this situation had the UN systems got its act together after Rwanda: their action was too little too late.\" On 20 October 120 genocide survivors of The Holocaust, and the Cambodian and Rwandan Genocides, backed by six aid agencies, submitted an open letter to the European Union, calling on them to do more, proposing a UN peacekeeping force as \"the only viable option.\"\n\n\"Watchers of the Sky\", a 2014 documentary by Edet Belzberg, interviews former journalist and United States Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power about the war in Darfur. Also featured is Luis Moreno Ocampo, former ICC jurist and lead prosecutor on the ICC investigation in Darfur.\nBrutality of militias, violence used by armed forces, corruption and human right abuse were also shown in \"ER\" television series (e.g. episodes 12x19, 12x20), and in \"The Devil Came on Horseback\", a documentary made in 2007.\n\n\n Known as the National Redemption Front prior to 2011.\n\n"}

Categories include websites; advertising and media; online film and video; mobile sites and apps; and social.\n\nTwo winners are selected in each category, one by members of The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and one by the public who cast their votes during Webby People’s Voice voting. Each winner presents a five-word acceptance speech, a trademark of the annual awards show.\n\nHailed as the \"Internet’s highest honor,\" the award is one of the oldest Internet-oriented awards, and is associated with the phrase \"The Oscars of the Internet.\"\n\nThe Webby Awards began in 1996, sponsored by the Academy of Web Design and Cool Site of the Day. The first Webby Awards were produced by Kay Dangaard at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel as a nod to the first site of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars). That first year, they were called \"Webbie\" Awards. The first \"Site of the Year\" winner was the pioneer webisodic serial The Spot.\n\nToday's Webby Awards were founded by Tiffany Shlain when she was hired by \"The Web Magazine\" to re-establish them. The event was held in San Francisco from 1996 to 2004 and quickly became known for their \"5 word Acceptance Speeches\". After the first year the awards became more successful than the magazine and IDG closed the publication. Shlain continued to run The Webby Awards with the help of Maya Draisin until 2004.\n\nThe International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, which selects the winners of The Webby Awards, was established in 1998 by co-founders Tiffany Shlain, Spencer Ante and Maya Draisin. Members of the Academy include Kevin Spacey, Grimes, Questlove, Internet inventor Vint Cerf, Instagram’s Head of Fashion Partnerships Eva Chen, comedian Jimmy Kimmel, Twitter Founder Biz Stone, Vice Media Co-Founder and CEO Shane Smith, Tumblr’s David Karp, Director of Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society Susan P. Crawford, Refinery29’s Executive Creative Director Piera Gelardi, and CEO and cofounder of Gimlet Media Alex Blumberg.\n\nThe Webby Awards is owned and operated by the Webby Media Group, a division of Recognition Media, which also owns and produces the Lovie Awards in Europe and Netted by the Webbys, a daily email publication launched in 2009. David-Michel Davies, CEO of Webby Media Group, current Executive Director of the Webby Awards and co-founder of Internet Week New York, was named Executive Director of the Webby Awards in 2005.\n\nIn 2009, the 13th Annual Webby Awards received nearly 10,000 entries from all 50 states and over 60 countries. That same year, more than 500,000 votes were cast in The Webby People's Voice Awards. In 2012, the 16th Annual Webby awards received 1.5 million votes from more than 200 countries for the People's Voice awards. In 2015, the 19th Annual Webby Awards received nearly 13,000 entries from all 50 U.S. states and over 60 countries worldwide.\n\nDuring the Call for Entries phase, each entry is rated by Associate Members of the International Academy of Digital Arts & Sciences. Entries that receive the highest marks during this first round of voting are included on category-specific shortlists and further evaluated by Executive Members of the Academy.\n\nExecutive Academy Members with category-specific expertise evaluate the shortlisted entries based on the appropriate Website, Advertising & Media, Online Film & Video, Mobile Sites & Apps, and Social category criteria, and cast ballots to determine Webby Honorees, Nominees and Webby Winners. Deloitte provides vote tabulation consulting for the Webby Awards.\n\nIn addition to the award given in each category by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, another winner is selected in each category as determined by the general public during People’s Voice voting. Winners of both the Academy-selected and People’s Voice-selected awards are invited to the Webbys.\n\nThe Webby Awards are presented in over a hundred categories among all four types of entries. A website can be entered in multiple categories and receive multiple awards.\n\nIn each category, two awards are handed out: a Webby Award selected by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences, and a People's Voice Award selected by the general public.\n\nPast winners include Amazon.com, eBay, \"Travel + Leisure\", Simply Hired, Kayak.com, Yahoo!, iTunes, Google, FedEx, BBC News, CNN, MSNBC, \"The New York Times\", Annie Lennox, NPR, \"Salon Magazine\", Facebook, Meetup, Wikipedia, \"Deleted - The Game\", Flickr, ESPN, Comedy Central, PBS, \"The Office\" webisodes, SwiftKey, \"My Damn Channel\", NASA, George Takei, Airbnb, \"The Onion\", Kickstarter, Mashable, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bieber, Rhett and Link, and \"Humans of New York\".\n\nEach year, the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences also honors individuals with Webby Special Achievement Awards. Past Webby Special Achievement winners include Al Gore, Prince, David Bowie, Meg Whitman, Tim & Eric, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, Lorne Michaels, Craig Newmark, Thomas Friedman, Stephen Colbert, Michel Gondry, the Beastie Boys, Kevin Spacey, Banksy, Lawrence Lessig, Van Jones, Gillian Anderson, Tituss Burgess, Ellie Kemper and Jerry Seinfeld.\n\nSince 2005, The Webby Awards has been presented in New York City. Comedian Rob Corddry hosted the ceremony from 2005 to 2007. Seth Meyers of Saturday Night Live hosted in 2008 and 2009, B.J. Novak of NBC's The Office in 2010, and Lisa Kudrow in 2011.\n\nComedian, actor, and writer Patton Oswalt hosted from 2012 to 2014. Comedian Hannibal Buress will host the 19th Annual Webby Awards.\n\nThe Webbys are famous for limiting recipients to five-word speeches, which are often humorous, although some exceed the limit. In 2005 when accepting his Lifetime Achievement Award, former Vice President Al Gore's speech was \"Please don't recount this vote.\" He was introduced by Vint Cerf who used the same format to state, \"We all invented the Internet.\" In 2008, Stephen Colbert shouted “Me. Me. Me. Me. Me” when accepting his award for Webby Person of the Year. Accepting the award for Best Political Blog in 2008, Arianna Huffington’s speech was “President Obama ... Sounds good, right?\" \n\nOther popular speeches include \"Can anyone fix my computer?\" (the Beastie Boys); \"Everything you think is true\" (Prince); \"Thank God Conan got promoted\" (Jimmy Fallon), \"Free, open... Keep one Web\" (Sir Tim Berners Lee), “Holy - Fucking - Shit, Buzz Aldrin\" (Jake Hurwitz), and \"Holocaust. Did it happen? Yes.\" (Sarah Silverman).\n\nIn 2013, the creator of the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), Steve Wilhite, accepted his Webby and delivered his now famous five-word speech, \"It’s pronounced 'Jif' not 'Gif'.\"\n\nThe Webbys have been criticized for their pay-to-enter and pay-to-attend policy (winners and nominees also have to pay to attend the award ceremony), and thus for not taking most websites into consideration before distributing their awards. Gawker, its Valleywag column, and others, have called the awards a scam, with Valleywag saying, \"...somewhere along the way, the organizers figured out that this goofy charade could be milked for profit.\"\n\nIn response, Webby Awards executive director David-Michel Davies told the Wall Street Journal that entry fees “provide the best and most sustainable model for ensuring that our judging process remains consistent and rigorous and is not dependent on things like sponsorships that can fluctuate from year to year.”\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38274014", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38274014", "title": "Wildcat Comic Con", "text": "Wildcat Comic Con\n\nWildcat Comic Con was a comic book convention held in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, United States, at the Pennsylvania College of Technology. The conventions name came from the mascot of the Pennsylvania College of Technology. Wildcat Comic Con placed extra value with educators and librarians and how comic books and graphic novels can be used in the educational fields.\n\nWildcat Comic Con typically featured an animation film festival, artist alley, author book-signings, author luncheons, cosplay competition, exhibitors, drawing sessions, fan presentations, LAN party, masquerade ball, portfolio reviews, professional presentations, Star Wars impersonators, vendors, video game contests and demonstrations, and workshops.\n\nThe convention was the first large scale Comic Con to be held in Central Pennsylvania and the first to be held by a college. The idea for the convention came from John Weaver, a high school teacher. It was primarily organized by Lisette Ormsbee (director of the Madigan Library) and John Shableski (former comics distributor), neither of which had previous experience hosting an comic convention. The convention evolved from lectures hosted with the local high school to promote Penn College's video game program. Early in the planning of the convention, discussions were held about naming the convention Millionaire Comic-Con (the high schools mascots name), and holding it at Williamsport High School. Several comic book nights \"ComiXnite\" were held during the fall at Penn College on Wednesday nights to build interest in the convention. In the first year the convention provided eighty hours of content. In 2014, the convention held post event programming that included game shows and gaming.\n\nThe convention received financial support from the community in 2013 including a $9,000 grant from the Lycoming County Visitors Bureau (Lycoming County Travel and Tourism Initiative) and $2,250 from the Pennsylvania Army National Guard (Heroes 4 Higher group). The Lycoming County Visitors Bureau raised its funding from $5,000 in 2012. In 2013 the convention had 38 vendors, an increase from 10 in 2012. The Lycoming County Visitors Bureau granted $10,000 to Wildcat Comic Con in 2014 for advertising.\n\n"}

It is the first and only women's film festival in the country.\n\nIt is the largest women's film festival in Asia, and predates the \"Taipei Film Festival\", which was founded in 1998. Since 2005, there is also an annual \"Asian Lesbian Film and Video Festival\" in Taipei, and since 2014, the annual \"Taiwan International Queer Film Festival (TIQFF)\", the only LGBTQ film festival in Taiwan, which has screenings every autumn in Taipei and two other major cities. \n\nIn \"Chinese Women's Cinema: Transnational Contexts\", edited by Lingzhen Wang, it is noted that the initial event at the Huo K'o Gallery in Taipei was called the \"Women's Visual Arts Festival\". It was founded by the Taiwanese filmmaker Yu-shan Huang, supported by Lee Yuan-chen and other members of the \"Women Awakening\" magazine.\n\nThe film festival is organized by the Taiwan Women's Film Association (TFWA) which was established in 1998 with help from the Taiwan government and civic organisations, and was originally known as the Taipei Women's Film Association.\n\nIn 2001, it became the first touring film festival in Taiwan with the aim of reducing the urban-rural divide in access to cinema.\n\nThe film festival has screened nearly one thousand international and Taiwanese films, specialising in films of a feminist perspective, moving beyond the mainstream outlook to focus on voices and issues that are often unheard, explored and delighted in. The organization is also involved in distribution of films and books; it works in education and video training. The members of TWFA are mainly filmmakers, artists and academics of film or gender studies. Highlights from the film festival have also gone on an international tour including to New York.\n\n"}
