The warships passed within six miles of the Soviet coast, where they were soon confronted by the Soviet frigate . The commander of \"Ladny\" notified the U.S. warships that they had violated Soviet territorial waters and requested that they depart immediately. The U.S. warships confirmed receipt of the warning but did not change course. The Soviet command placed its Black Sea air and naval forces on combat readiness and dispatched border guard vessels and naval aircraft to intercept the U.S. warships.\n\n\"Yorktown\" and \"Caron\" stayed in Soviet territorial waters for roughly two hours. The situation de-escalated when the U.S. ships left; diplomatic repercussions continued for several weeks.\n\n\"The Rules of Navigation and Sojourn of Foreign Warships in the Territorial Waters and Internal Waters and Ports of the USSR\", enacted by the Soviet Council of Ministers in 1983, acknowledged the right of innocent passage of foreign warships only in restricted areas of Soviet territorial waters in the Baltic, Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan. There were no sea lanes for innocent passage in the Black Sea. The United States, starting from 1979, conducted a freedom of navigation program as the U.S. government believed that many countries were beginning to assert jurisdictional boundaries that far exceeded traditional claims. The program was implemented because diplomatic protests seemed ineffective. The U.S. actions in the Black Sea were challenged by the Soviet Union several times prior to the 1986 incident, particularly on 9 December 1968, August 1979 and on 18 February 1984.\n\nOn 10 March 1986, the USS \"Yorktown\", accompanied by the USS \"Caron\", entered the Black Sea via the Turkish Straits. Their entrance was observed by a , \"Ladny\", which was ordered to continue observation. On 13 March \"Yorktown\" and \"Caron\" entered the Soviet territorial waters and sailed west along the southern Crimean Peninsula, approaching within six miles of the coast. Having entered from the direction of Feodosia, the US warships sailed for two hours and 21 minutes. Both American warships also confronted the Soviet border guard vessels \"Dozorny\" and \"Izmail\". The commander of \"Ladny\", Captain Zhuravlev, reported the incident to his superiors.\n\nAccording to \"Izvestiya\" editor Vyacheslav Lukashin, at the time of the incident the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy Vladimir Chernavin knew that the order for the U.S. warships to proceed into Soviet waters was given by the U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger with the consent of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs held two press conferences concerning the incident. The U.S. charge d'affaires, Richard Combs, was summoned to the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive the Soviet protest. The Soviet Union stated that the U.S. violation of its territorial waters \"was of a demonstrative, defiant nature and pursued clearly provocative aims\". Vladimir Chernavin affirmed that \"the innocent passage of foreign warships through the territorial waters of the USSR is permitted only in specially authorized coastal areas which have been announced by the Soviet government [and] there are no such areas in the Black Sea off the coast of the Soviet Union\".\n\nReplying to the Soviet note verbale about the incident, the U.S. stated that \"the transit of the USS \"Yorktown\" and USS \"Caron\" through the claimed Soviet territorial sea on March 13, 1986, was a proper exercise of the right of innocent passage, which international law, both customary and conventional, has long accorded ships of all states\". The U.S. Department of State's instructions to the American embassy in the Soviet Union noted the U.S. \"would not want to lend any validity to a Soviet position that their domestic law was at all relevant in determining U.S. navigational rights under international law\". An article in the \"American Journal of International Law\" argued in 1987 that \"the course of the American warships indicated on a map published in Izvestiia confirms that the passage of the vessels was a lateral one\" and that \"at no time did they take a course that could be construed as expressing an intention to enter the internal waters or ports of the USSR\".\n\nIn the subsequent incident of 1988, the same USS \"Yorktown\" and USS \"Caron\", while claiming innocent passage again in the Black Sea, were bumped by the Soviet vessels.\n"}

The entire 1,230-game schedule, that was set to begin in October, was officially canceled on February 16, 2005 due to an unresolved lockout that began on September 16, 2004. The loss of the 2004–05 season's games made the NHL the first North America professional sports league to lose an entire season of games because of a labor dispute. It was the first time since 1919, when a Spanish flu pandemic canceled the playoffs, that the Stanley Cup was not awarded. This canceled season was later acknowledged with the words \"2004–05 Season Not Played\" engraved on the Cup.\n\nAccording to the International Ice Hockey Federation, 388 NHL players were on teams overseas at some point during the season, spread across 19 European leagues. Many of these players had a contract clause to return to the NHL when the league started up again, even if it was during the current season.\n\nKey rule changes which would dominate after the lockout were established as a result of a meeting between the NHL and its top minor league, the American Hockey League. On July 5, 2004, the AHL announced publicly the 2004–05 rule changes, many of which were passed as a result of the NHL's recommendation for experimentation.\nAs a result of the lockout, no Stanley Cup champion was crowned for the first time since the flu pandemic in 1919. This was controversial among many fans, who questioned whether the NHL had exclusive control over the Cup. A website known as freestanley.com (since closed) was launched, asking fans to write to the Cup trustees and urge them to return to the original pre-NHL Challenge Cup format. Adrienne Clarkson, then Governor General of Canada, alternately proposed that the Cup be presented to the top women's hockey team in lieu of the NHL season, but this idea was so unpopular with NHL fans, players, and officials that the Clarkson Cup was created instead. Meanwhile, a group in Ontario, also known as the \"Wednesday Nighters\", filed an application with the Ontario Superior Court, claiming that the Cup trustees had overstepped their bounds in signing the 1947 agreement with the NHL, and therefore must award the trophy to any team willing to play for the cup regardless of the lockout.\n\nOn February 7, 2006, a settlement was reached in which the trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams in the event the league does not operate for a season, but the dispute lasted so long that, by the time it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season.\n\n"}

There was also concern about the Russia–Turkey relationship. Donald Trump, the President of the United States, urged the NATO members to meet the 2014 agreement to seek to spend at least two percent of their gross domestic product on defense. According to at least one senior White House official, Donald Trump had expressed interest in inviting Russia to the G7 summit and was considering leaving the NATO alliance. During the opening ceremony of the new NATO headquarters building, President Trump gave a speech which did not mention Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, surprising H. R. McMaster, the National Security Advisor, James Mattis, the United States Secretary of Defense, and Rex Tillerson, the United States Secretary of State, who had approved a different speech that explicitly included the collective security commitment.\n\nNATO was set to become a full member of the Global Coalition, alongside NATO pledging to increase its support to the Coalition. A terrorism intelligence cell was agreed to be set up within the new intelligence division, which is intended to improve the sharing of information between members.\n\nThe Alliance leaders agreed to submit national action plans by December, which were to set out how members intend to meet the pledge to spend at least two percent of their GDP on defense by 2024.\n\nMontenegro, represented by the prime minister Duško Marković, joined the meeting, days before it was to officially become a member of the organization on 5 June 2017. The possibility of NATO membership was said to remain open to other states.\n\nA few days after, also following a G7 meeting, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told a crowd in a Bavarian beer hall that \"we Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands – of course in friendship with the United States of America, in friendship with Great Britain and as good neighbors wherever that is possible also with other countries, even with Russia. But we have to know that we must fight for our future on our own, for our destiny as Europeans.\"\n\nThe next major summit (29th) was to take place in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. However, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Denmark have reportedly led a drive to block it.\n\nOn 20 Oct. 2017 the NATO Secretary General announces that the 29th summit would be on 11 and 12 July 2018 in Brussels.\n\n\n"}

The AfCM also incorporates a Winterschool for emerging artists. Some 20 to 30 chamber musicians from around Australia and the world converge on Townsville, each year to perform and teach emerging artists.\n\nThe festival was founded in July 1991 and has been held annually ever since. In 2015 it celebrated its 25th anniversary. It is the largest festival dedicated to chamber music in the southern hemisphere.\n\nThe AFCM is presented in partnership with all three levels of government as well as several commercial, tourism, regional development, and educational, organisations. The festival's patron is Paul de Jersey, Governor of Queensland.\n\nThe festival was founded in 1990 for a 1991 premiere by Professor Ray Golding, the then Vice-Chancellor of James Cook University and Theodore Kuchar who continued as the artistic director for the next 16 years until 2006. The festival began conservatively focusing on the more contemporary music of the classical and romantic periods, over the first five years Kuchar started inserting works of Bartok, Bloch, Martinu, Shostakovich, expanding the musical depth for enthusiasts while maintaining the popular appeal.\n\nThe festival has tried to avoid a perception that it is only there for cultivated southerners, for example in 2005 for the first time the AFCM had a presence at a Cowboys football match and in 2006 increased publicity focusing locally.\n\nIn 2007 the AFCM gained a new Artistic Director in Piers Lane AO. Lane, an Australian, is a leading international pianist who is based in London; The 2007 programme involved vocalists and more variety than previous years to appeal to a broader audience, taking a \"lifestyle approach\" and focussing on music, wine and food.\n\nAt the 2006 festival about 10,000 tickets were issued with five concerts sold out, outperforming all previous years and 2005 by 20%; it had pre-sold 1200 tickets for one concert alone (Symphony Under the Stars at Queens Gardens) and had an average audience size of about 750 people. About 50% of audience numbers were from interstate or international guests to Townsville.\n\nDuring the festival master classes are held for around 30 music students attending the Winterschool by the artists who also have a full schedule of performances.\n\nEach year the Festival has a \"day-off\" during which festival patrons have an opportunity to hear chamber music but in more unusual settings.\n\nThe Orpheus Island Cruise has been one of the highlights for festival patrons. En-oute to Orpheus Island, whales have been often cited in the waters around the Palm Island group. Upon llanding,patrons had the opportunity to enjoy the secluded beach and adjacent national park before settling down for a short performance from festival artists. The tour first took place in 2013 and was repeated in 2016.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2010, the Outback Tour brought some of the best music in the world to some of the most isolated places in the world. In 2006 enthusiastic music lovers, join six musicians (including didgeridoo player William Barton) in a five-day tour of Outback Australia, visiting Cloncurry, Ernest Henry Mine, Mount Isa, Normanton and Karumba focusing on fine food and music and masterclasses with hands on experience of the Queensland mining industry and communities. Works included; Peter Sculthorpe – String Quartet No. 9; Philip Glass – String Quartet No. 2 \"Company\"; Hardin (aka Moondog) – Synchrony No. 2; Lee – Morango – Like a Tango; Barton – Sacred Song and Hindson – Technologic.\n\n"}

Large volumes of cheap alcohol such as beer, spirits, Bundaberg Rum and Jim Beam can be consumed. The activities usually start at night and run until morning, but from mid-afternoon people will start to arrive and the partying/drinking will begin. Country music is often featured at these events.\n\nHistorically the event was centered on country people trying to find a partner, but in modern times the focus has shifted to having a good time and meeting up with new and old friends, some of whom can live many hours away. This has changed the atmosphere of the events to such a degree that the dress code is relaxed and many do not wear formal gear, preferring to dress in clothes from opportunity shops. Even when they are wearing formal attire, today most of the men (and some of the women) sport Akubras, boots and R. M. Williams gear. Some people go in fancy dress, for example, school girls, nurses, clowns or lawn bowlers.\n\nIt is not unusual for the modern B&S's to be run by ute enthusiasts following minor Ute Musters. Ute drivers at the B&S Balls sometimes perform stunts, such as driving their utes at dusk and throw flames from the exhausts and do circle work. Circle work, usually banned, is where the utes are driven in tighter and tighter circles. Food dye is a regular sight at a B&S and is normally thrown on people (even when it is banned). A B&S Virgin (a person who is attending for the first time) is often marked with the word \"Virgin\".\n\nAfter the event people usually sleep in their swag on the back of their ute. Usually the committee supplies something for dinner and breakfast the next day. Some committees run a 'recovery' where the ball goers move to a different location to continue drinking, having fun and sometimes participating in competitions.\n\nTickets can cost anything from AU$80 to AU$110 and usually include all you can drink, dinner and sometimes breakfast as well as little gifts such as ear tags, hats, stickers and sometimes condoms and lubricant. People will travel many kilometres to attend the balls, and the profits made from them go to charities and organizations such as the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia, Red Cross and the Australian Cancer Council, as well as local charities of the specific area.\n\nToday the future of B&S balls are in jeopardy as rising insurance costs take their toll and more young people from country areas move to cities. However thousands of people make the effort to drive for many hours to support something that they love and wish to continue for future generations. There are many websites dedicated to the future of balls.\n\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Bachelor and Spinster Balls were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an \"event and festival\".\n"}

(One authority says the battle was fought on June 13.)\n\nJoscelin I of Edessa had captured Azaz in northern Syria from the atabeg of Aleppo in 1118. The next year the Crusaders under Roger of Salerno were severely defeated at the Battle of Ager Sanguinis, and King Baldwin II of Jerusalem was captured while patrolling in Edessa in 1123.\n\nIn 1124 Baldwin II was released, and almost immediately he laid siege to Aleppo on October 8, 1124. This caught the attention of il-Bursuqi, the Seljuk atabeg of Mosul. Il-Bursuqi marched south to relieve the siege of Aleppo, which was nearing the point of surrender in January 1125 after a three-month siege. In spite of the city being \"the greatest prize the war could offer\", Baldwin cautiously withdrew without a fight.\n\nLater, il-Bursuqi (who had received troops also by Toghtekin of Damascus) besieged the town of Azaz, to the north of Aleppo, in territory belonging to the County of Edessa. Baldwin II, Leo I of Armenia, Joscelin I, and Pons of Tripoli, with a force of 1,100 knights from their respective territories (including knights from Antioch, where Baldwin was regent), as well as 2,000 infantry, met il-Bursuqi outside Azaz, where the Seljuk atabeg had gathered his much larger force. Baldwin pretended to retreat, thereby drawing the Seljuks away from Azaz into the open where they were surrounded. After a long and bloody battle, the Seljuks were defeated and their camp captured by Baldwin, who took enough loot to ransom the prisoners taken by the Seljuks (including the future Joscelin II of Edessa).\n\nAl Bursuqi retired to Aleppo, leaving his son Masud as governor and crossed the Euphrates to Mosul, where he gathered troops to renew the fight. Apart from relieving Azaz, this victory allowed the Crusaders to regain much of the influence they had lost after their defeat at Ager Sanguinis in 1119. Baldwin planned to attack Aleppo as well, but Antioch, which passed to Bohemund II when he came of age in 1126, began to fight with Edessa and the plan fell through. Aleppo and Mosul were united under the much stronger ruler Zengi in 1128, and Crusader control of northern Syria began to dwindle.\n\nThe number of Muslim troops killed was more than 1,000, according to Ibn al-Athir. William of Tyre gave 24 dead for the Crusaders and 2,000 for the Muslims. Fulcher of Chartres suggested 5 emirs and 2,000 soldiers dead, while Matthew of Edessa estimated 15 emirs and 5,000 troops killed.\n\n"}
{"id": "4322113", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4322113", "title": "Bugojno group", "text": "Bugojno group\n\nThe Bugojno group () was the name of a Croatian paramilitary formation which was infiltrated into Yugoslavia on June 20, 1972 to raise a rebellion against the socialist Yugoslav government.\n\nThe Bugojno group was organized by the Croatian Revolutionary Brotherhood (\"Hrvatsko revolucionarno bratstvo\" or HRB). The HRB was formed in Australia in 1961 and was active in Europe and the United States. The founding principle of the HRB was the separation of Croatia from Yugoslavia, and the reestablishment of the Independent State of Croatia through violence.\n\nAfter the suppression of the Croatian Spring movement in 1971, the HRB believed that there existed in Croatia a political climate which would support the beginning of an armed rebellion. After short preparations, the HRB organized their personnel, weapons and funding to support an initial group to start a rebellion. Most of the fighters and money came from Australia while the armed training was done in West Germany. After a short preparation in Austria, the 19-member group traveled through Dravograd into Yugoslavia by truck (the driver of which later reported them to police), on June 20, 1972. The Yugoslav territorial defense units soon began a massive search to find them. The insurgents were armed with M-16 and HK G-3 rifles.\n\nThe group was named after the Bosnian town of Bugojno, as their goal was to reach the mountain of Raduša south of the town. The operation was called \"Phoenix\" by the Croatian militants, while the counterinsurgency operation carried out by the Yugoslav forces bore the codename \"Raduša 72\".\n\nThe Yugoslav Army had no special forces at its disposal, and relied exclusively on some 30,000 poorly trained conscript soldiers and reservists units for the search. The first clash with the security forces took place on June 25 at the edge of a wood near Uskoplje (Gornji Vakuf). The group successfully drove back a team of 30 Yugoslav troops and policemen, killing the officer in charge, captain Miloš Popović, and a soldier. Two other soldiers were wounded. The group, however, fled in disarray as their own commander, Adolf Andrić, was also killed in the action. Three other members were caught over the next 24 hours. Although forced to hide, the insurgents managed to regroup near Ramsko Lake. Cornered once more by 1,000 territorial defense soldiers, the rebels were dispersed and compelled to seek shelter among the civilian population. During the withdrawal, one unit of the territorial defense was ambushed by the militants in a forest clearing near their hideout, a cave in the surroundings of Rumboci, a village on the northern shores of Ramsko Lake, in the region of Bukovac. Nine Yugoslav soldiers were killed, one of them after being captured. The paramilitaries headed for Sinj and Imotski, in Croatia, where they became decimated in a series of ambushes and counter-ambushes with Yugoslav forces. With the help of an informer the Bugojno group was eventually apprehended by July 24.\n\nThe Yugoslav losses were 13 killed in action and 14 wounded. Of the 19 members of the group, 15 were killed, 10 in action, whilst 5 were summarily executed after having surrendered. The last four members of the group were captured, tried and sentenced on December 21, 1972. Ludvig Pavlović, who was a minor, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and the remaining three were executed by firing squad on March 17, 1973, at the Police headquarters in Sarajevo. Pavlović was released from prison in 1990 and was killed in controversial circumstances during the Yugoslav Wars on September 18, 1991.\n"}

The celebration includes decorating Christmas trees, singing Christmas carols, and gift exchanges.\n\nAccording to the local legend, in the early part of the 20th century a freak blizzard stranded visitors and their stagecoach at the Old Faithful Inn. Rather than lament the fact that they were snowbound in a hotel, the guests decided to celebrate Christmas, since it looked like Christmas outside. Some stories place this blizzard as happening \"shortly after the turn of the [20th] century\" while others specify the blizzard occurred in 1939 and some place it in the 1920s.\n\nSome stories date the blizzard to the 19th century, prior to the creation of the Old Faithful Inn. There is no historical record recording that a blizzard ever hit Yellowstone on or around August 25 of any given year. In fact, between 1904 and 1941, the most snow that Yellowstone received on any given day in August was 1.8 inches on August 18, 1932. Interviews with older employees indicate that the celebration was not held prior to the 1930s.\n\nWhile the actual origins to the Christmas in August story are unknown, Yellowstone's Information Specialist Leslie Quinn speculates that the origins are based upon three factors. First, during the 1930s the celebration of Christmas in July was a popular celebration in the Rocky Mountains. Second, August 25th is the anniversary of the National Park Service. Third, there was an existing celebration in the park known as \"Savage Days.\" Quinn discovered a 1966 article published by the Park's Recreation department titled, \"\"Christmas Comes Twice a Year—Once At Home and Once Up Here.\" In the article, Gene \"Mr. Yellowstone Music\" Quaw, indicated that there was no Christmas in August celebration while he worked in Yellowstone during the 1920s and 1930s. According to Quaw, there was a small Christmas in July celebration and that the employees would have an employee-only celebration called \"Savage Days\" wherein a park employee would dress as Santa Claus.\n\nIn 1977, park historian Aubrey L. Haines, indicated that the earliest reference in the 1947 employee handbooks was an indication that read \"O. F. Savages held annual celebration, 7/25.\" According to the August 1, 1947 issue of \"Yellowstone's Weekly News\" the July 25th celebration had nothing to do with Christmas. \"The 'savages' (concessionaire employees) at Old Faithful held a gala affair on July 25 known as \"Savage Day.\" Several floats were entered in the long parade up the main street at Old Faithful. The day concluded with a large masquerade ball in the evening.\" Haines indicates that he remembered the celebrations going back to 1939 when he worked at Old Faithful as an Assistant District Ranger, but that nobody paid the employee-only celebration much attention.\n\nBy 1953, however, the annual celebration known as \"savage days\" had become a parkwide celebration and had attracted the attention of the park concessioners and National Park Service as it interfered with service quality.\n\n1953 was the last year \"Savage Days\" were celebrated in Yellowstone National Park. Starting in 1954, the park concessionaires made a concerted effort to merge Savage Days with the smaller \"Christmas in July\" celebration. Trevor Povah, the head of Hamilton Stores, one of the park concessioners claims that the park concessioners deliberately created the story of a blizzard at the Old Faithful Inn to obfuscate the origins of a new celebration called \"Savage Christmas.\" In 1955, the first publications came out mentioning \"Savage Christmas.\" From 1954–59, the celebration was held either on July 25 or August 25, but by 1959 August 25 became the permanent date. Quinn speculates that there were two reasons why the August 25th date prevailed over the July 25th one. First, the tourist season in Yellowstone starts in May and ends at the end of August, by celebrating Christmas on August 25th, it became an end of the tourist season celebration. Second, Warren Ost, a bellhop at the Old Faithful Inn and founder of A Christian Ministry in the National Parks (ACMNP), had started a choir. The choir held its first celebration on August 7, 1949. Within two years, ACMNP was forming choirs at the Old Faithful, Mammoth Hot Springs, and Lake areas of the park with the intention of performing Handel's Messiah. Quinn reasons that having the Messiah, which was an annual tradition from the early 1950s through the 1990s, coincide with the Christmas celebration would have been a logical step. \"But with only a short season in which to prepare, an August date for the concert\nwould have been more reasonable, and this may have been a factor in the July-to- August switch.\" Delmar J. Sicard, III, the author who wrote the article \"Christmas Comes Twice A Year—Once At Home And Once Up Here\" noted that the Christmas celebrations \"began to take on a more serious and formal aspect\" with the arrival of ACMNP serminarians.\n"}

{"id": "1265393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1265393", "title": "Congo Crisis", "text": "Congo Crisis\n\nThe Congo Crisis () was a period of political upheaval and conflict in the Republic of the Congo (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo) between 1960 and 1965. The crisis began almost immediately after the Congo became independent from Belgium and ended, unofficially, with the entire country under the rule of Joseph-Désiré Mobutu. Constituting a series of civil wars, the Congo Crisis was also a proxy conflict in the Cold War, in which the Soviet Union and the United States supported opposing factions. Around 100,000 people are believed to have been killed during the crisis.\n\nA nationalist movement in the Belgian Congo demanded the end of colonial rule: this led to the country's independence on 30 June 1960. Minimal preparations had been made and many issues, such as federalism, tribalism, and ethnic nationalism, remained unresolved. In the first week of July, a mutiny broke out in the army and violence erupted between black and white civilians. Belgium sent troops to protect fleeing whites. Katanga and South Kasai seceded with Belgian support. Amid continuing unrest and violence, the United Nations deployed peacekeepers, but UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to use these troops to help the central government in Léopoldville fight the secessionists. Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, the charismatic leader of the largest nationalist faction, reacted by calling for assistance from the Soviet Union, which promptly sent military advisors and other support.\n\nThe involvement of the Soviets split the Congolese government and led to an impasse between Lumumba and President Joseph Kasa-Vubu. Mobutu, in command of the army, broke this deadlock with a coup d'état, expelled the Soviet advisors and established a new government effectively under his own control. Lumumba was taken captive and subsequently executed in 1961. A rival government of the \"Free Republic of the Congo\" was founded in the eastern city of Stanleyville by Lumumba supporters led by Antoine Gizenga. It gained Soviet support but was crushed in early 1962. Meanwhile, the UN took a more aggressive stance towards the secessionists after Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash in late 1961. Supported by UN troops, Léopoldville defeated secessionist movements in Katanga and South Kasai by the start of 1963.\n\nWith Katanga and South Kasai back under the government's control, a reconciliatory compromise constitution was adopted and the exiled Katangese leader, Moïse Tshombe, was recalled to head an interim administration while fresh elections were organised. Before these could be held, however, Maoist-inspired militants calling themselves the \"Simbas\" rose up in the east of the country. The Simbas took control of a significant amount of territory and proclaimed a communist \"People's Republic of the Congo\" in Stanleyville. Government forces gradually retook territory and, in November 1964, Belgium and the United States intervened militarily in Stanleyville to recover hostages from Simba captivity. The Simbas were defeated and collapsed soon after. Following the elections in March 1965, a new political stalemate developed between Tshombe and Kasa-Vubu, forcing the government into near-paralysis. Mobutu mounted a second coup d'état in November 1965, now taking personal control. Under Mobutu's rule, the Congo (renamed Zaire in 1971) was transformed into a dictatorship which would endure until his deposition in 1997.\n\nColonial rule in the Congo began in the late 19th century. King Leopold II of Belgium, frustrated by Belgium's lack of international power and prestige, attempted to persuade the Belgian government to support colonial expansion around the then-largely unexplored Congo Basin. The Belgian government's ambivalence about the idea led Leopold to eventually create the colony on his own account. With support from a number of Western countries, who viewed Leopold as a useful buffer between rival colonial powers, Leopold achieved international recognition for a personal colony, the Congo Free State, in 1885. By the turn of the century, however, the violence of Free State officials against indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic extraction had led to intense diplomatic pressure on Belgium to take official control of the country, which it did in 1908, creating the Belgian Congo.\n\nBelgian rule in the Congo was based around the \"colonial trinity\" (\"trinité coloniale\") of state, missionary and private company interests. The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that capital sometimes flowed back into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised. On many occasions, the interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied and the state helped companies with strikebreaking and countering other efforts by the indigenous population to better their lot. The country was split into nesting, hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions, and run uniformly according to a set \"native policy\" (\"politique indigène\")—in contrast to the British and the French, who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight. There was also a high degree of racial segregation. Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum, but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a \"model colony\". One of the results of the measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \"évolués\" in the cities. By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony. The Congo's rich natural resources, including uranium—much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese—led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed.\n\nAn African nationalist movement developed in the Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the \"évolués\". The movement was divided into a number of parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the \"Mouvement National Congolais\" (MNC), was a united front organisation dedicated to achieving independence \"within a reasonable\" time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Iléo, but others accused the party of being too moderate. Lumumba became a leading figure within the MNC, and by the end of 1959, the party claimed to have 58,000 members.\nThe MNC's main rival was the \"Alliance des Bakongo\" (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who advocated a more radical ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence and the promotion of regional identity. ABAKO's stance was more ethnic nationalist than the MNC's; it argued that an independent Congo should be run by the Bakongo as inheritors of the pre-colonial Kingdom of the Kongo. The \"Confédération des Associations Tribales du Katanga\" (CONAKAT), a localist party led by Moïse Tshombe, was the third major organisation; it advocated federalism and primarily represented the southern province of Katanga. These were joined by a number of smaller parties which emerged as the nationalist movement developed, including the radical \"Parti Solidaire Africain\" (PSA), and factions representing the interests of minor ethnic groups like the \"Alliance des Bayanzi\" (ABAZI).\n\nAlthough it was the largest of the African nationalist parties, the MNC had many different factions within it that took differing stances on a number of issues. It was increasingly polarised between moderate \"évolués\" and the more radical mass membership. A radical faction headed by Iléo and Albert Kalonji split away in July 1959, but failed to induce mass defections by other MNC members. The dissident faction became known as the MNC-Kalonji (MNC-K), while the majority group became the MNC-Lumumba (MNC-L). The split divided the party's support base into those who remained with Lumumba, chiefly in the Stanleyville region in the north-east, and those who backed the MNC-K, which became most popular around the southern city of Élisabethville and among the Luba ethnic group.\n\nMajor riots broke out in Léopoldville, the Congolese capital, on 4 January 1959 after a political demonstration turned violent. The \"Force Publique\", the colonial gendarmerie, used force against the rioters—at least 49 people were killed, and total casualties may have been as high as 500. The nationalist parties' influence expanded outside the major cities for the first time, and nationalist demonstrations and riots became a regular occurrence over the next year, bringing large numbers of black people from outside the \"évolué\" class into the independence movement. Many blacks began to test the boundaries of the colonial system by refusing to pay taxes or abide by minor colonial regulations. The bulk of the ABAKO leadership was arrested, leaving the MNC in an advantageous position.\n\nThese developments led to the white community also becoming increasing radicalised. Some whites planned to attempt a \"coup d'état\" if a black majority government took power. As law and order began to break down, white civilians formed militia groups known as \"Corps de Voluntaires Européens\" (\"European Volunteer Corps\") to police their neighbourhoods. These militias frequently attacked blacks.\n\nIn the fallout from the Léopoldville riots, the report of a Belgian parliamentary working group on the future of the Congo was published in which a strong demand for \"internal autonomy\" was noted. August de Schryver, the Minister of the Colonies, launched a high-profile Round Table Conference in Brussels in January 1960, with the leaders of all the major Congolese parties in attendance. Lumumba, who had been arrested following riots in Stanleyville, was released in the run-up to the conference and headed the MNC-L delegation. The Belgian government had hoped for a period of at least 30 years before independence, but Congolese pressure at the conference led to 30 June 1960 being set as the date. Issues including federalism, ethnicity and the future role of Belgium in Congolese affairs were left unresolved after the delegates failed to reach agreement.\n\nBelgians began campaigning against Lumumba, whom they wanted to marginalise; they accused him of being a communist and, hoping to fragment the nationalist movement, supported rival, ethnic-based parties like CONAKAT. Many Belgians hoped that an independent Congo would form part of a federation, like the French Community or British Commonwealth of Nations, and that close economic and political association with Belgium would continue. As independence approached, the Belgian government organised Congolese elections in May 1960. These resulted in an MNC relative majority.\n\nThe proclamation of the independent Republic of the Congo, and the end of colonial rule, occurred as planned on 30 June 1960. In a ceremony at the \"Palais de la Nation\" in Léopoldville, King Baudouin gave a speech in which he presented the end of colonial rule in the Congo as the culmination of the Belgian \"civilising mission\" begun by Leopold II. After the King's address, Lumumba gave an unscheduled speech in which he angrily attacked colonialism and described independence as the crowning success of the nationalist movement. Although Lumumba's address was acclaimed by figures such as Malcolm X, it nearly provoked a diplomatic incident with Belgium; even some Congolese politicians perceived it as unnecessarily provocative. Nevertheless, independence was celebrated across the Congo.\n\nPolitically, the new state had a semi-presidential constitution, known as the \"Loi Fondamentale\", in which executive power was shared between President and Prime Minister in a system known as \"bicephalisme\". Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister, of the Republic of the Congo. Despite the objections of CONAKAT and others, the constitution was largely centralist, concentrating power in the central government in Léopoldville, and did not devolve significant powers to provincial level.\n\nDespite the proclamation of independence, neither the Belgian nor the Congolese government intended the colonial social order to end immediately. The Belgian government hoped that whites might keep their position indefinitely. The Republic of the Congo was still reliant on colonial institutions like the \"Force Publique\" to function from day to day, and white technical experts, installed by the Belgians, were retained in the broad absence of suitably qualified black Congolese replacements (partly the result of colonial restrictions regarding higher education). Many Congolese people had assumed that independence would produce tangible and immediate social change, so the retention of whites in positions of importance was widely resented.\nLieutenant-General Émile Janssens, the Belgian commander of the \"Force Publique\", refused to see Congolese independence as marking a change in the nature of command. The day after the independence festivities, he gathered the black non-commissioned officers of his Léopoldville garrison and told them that things under his command would stay the same, summarising the point by writing \"Before Independence = After Independence\" on a blackboard. This message was hugely unpopular among the rank and file—many of the men had expected rapid promotions and increases in pay to accompany independence. On 5 July 1960, several units mutinied against their white officers at Camp Hardy near Thysville. The insurrection spread to Léopoldville the next day and later to garrisons across the country.\n\nRather than deploying Belgian troops against the mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the \"Force Publique\" the \"Armée Nationale Congolaise\" (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted by at least one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became deeply concerned by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.\nLumumba's stance appeared to many Belgians to justify their prior concerns about his radicalism. On 9 July, Belgium deployed paratroopers, without the Congolese state's permission, in Kabalo and elsewhere to protect fleeing white civilians. The Belgian intervention divided Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu; while Kasa-Vubu accepted the Belgian operation, Lumumba denounced it and called for \"all Congolese to defend our republic against those who menace it.\" At Lumumba's request, white civilians from the port city of Matadi were evacuated by the Belgian Navy on 11 July. Belgian ships then bombarded the city; at least 19 civilians were killed. This action prompted renewed attacks on whites across the country, while Belgian forces entered other towns and cities, including Léopoldville, and clashed with Congolese troops. The Belgian government subsequently announced that it would provide for Belgian bureaucrats back in the metropole, triggering an exodus of most of the Congo's 10,000 European civil servants and leaving the administration in disarray. Engulfed by the disorder spreading throughout the country, most of the government ministries were unable to function.\n\nOn 11 July 1960, Moïse Tshombe, the leader of CONAKAT, declared the Congo's southern province of Katanga independent as the State of Katanga, with Élisabethville as its capital and himself as President. The mineral-rich Katanga region had traditionally shared closer economic ties with the Copperbelt of neighbouring Northern Rhodesia (then part of the Central African Federation) than with the rest of the Congo, and because of its economic importance it had been administered separately from the rest of the country under the Belgians. CONAKAT furthermore contended that Katangese people were ethnically distinct from other Congolese. The secession was partly motivated by the Katangese separatists' desire to keep more of the wealth generated by the province's mining operations and to avoid sharing it with the rest of the Congo. Another major factor was what CONAKAT held to be the disintegration of law and order in the central and north-eastern Congo. Announcing Katanga's breakaway, Tshombe said \"We are seceding from chaos.\"\nThe major mining company in Katanga, the (UMHK), had begun supporting CONAKAT during the latter days of Belgian rule amid worries that the MNC might seek to nationalise the company's assets after independence. UMHK was largely owned by the , a prominent holding company based in Brussels that had close ties to the Belgian government. Encouraged by the UMHK, the Belgian government provided military support to Katanga and ordered its civil servants in the region to remain in their posts. Tshombe also recruited mercenaries, mainly whites from South Africa and the Rhodesias, to supplement and command Katangese troops. Although supported by the Belgians, Katanga never received formal diplomatic recognition from any country. The Katangese secession highlighted the \"fundamental weakness\" of the central government in Léopoldville, which had been the chief advocate of a unified state.\n\nLess than a month after the Katangese secession, on 8 August, a section of the region of Kasai situated slightly to the north of Katanga also declared its autonomy from the central government as the Mining State of South Kasai () based around the city of Bakwanga. South Kasai was much smaller than Katanga, but was also a mining region. It was largely populated by the Luba ethnic group, and its president, Albert Kalonji, claimed that the secession was largely sparked by persecution of the Baluba in the rest of the Congo. The South Kasai government was supported by , another Belgian mining company, which received concessions from the new state in return for financial support. Without control over Katanga and South Kasai, the central government was deprived of approximately 40 percent of its revenues.\n\nDisquiet about Belgium's support for the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, believed that the crisis would provide the organisation with a chance to demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.\nThe arrival of the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC) was initially welcomed by Lumumba and the central government who believed the UN would help suppress the secessionist states. ONUC's initial mandate, however, only covered the maintenance of law and order. Viewing the secessions as an internal political matter, Hammarskjöld refused to use UN troops to assist the central Congolese government against them; he argued that doing so would represent a loss of impartiality and breach Congolese sovereignty. Lumumba also sought the assistance of the United States government of Dwight D. Eisenhower, which refused to provide unilateral military support. Frustrated, he turned to the Soviet Union, which agreed to provide weapons, logistical and material support. Around 1,000 Soviet military advisors soon landed in the Congo. Lumumba's actions distanced him from the rest of the government, especially Kasa-Vubu, who feared the implications of Soviet intervention. The Americans also feared that a Soviet-aligned Congo could form the basis of a major expansion of communism into central Africa.\n\nWith Soviet support, 2,000 ANC troops launched a major offensive against South Kasai. The attack was extremely successful, but during the course of the offensive, the ANC became involved in infighting between the Baluba and Bena Lulua ethnic groups. and perpetrated a number of large massacres of Luba civilians. Around 3,000 were killed. The violence of the advance caused an exodus of thousands of Baluba civilians who fled their homes to escape the fighting.\n\nThe involvement of the Soviet Union alarmed the United States. The American government under Eisenhower, in line with Belgian criticism, had long believed that Lumumba was a communist and that the Congo could be on track to become a strategically placed Soviet client state. In August 1960, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agents in the region reported to their agency that \"Congo [is] experiencing [a] classic communist ... takeover\" and warned that the Congo might follow the same path as Cuba.\n\nLumumba's appeal for Soviet support split the government and led to mounting pressure from Western countries to remove him from power. In addition, both Tshombe and Kalonji appealed to Kasa-Vubu, who they believed to be both a moderate and federalist, to move against Lumumba's centralism and resolve the secession issue. Meanwhile, Mobutu took effective control of the army, routing foreign aid and promotions to specific units and officers to secure their allegiance.\n\nOn 5 September 1960, Kasa-Vubu announced on national radio that he had unilaterally dismissed Lumumba, using the massacres in South Kasai as a pretext and with the promise of American backing. Andrew Cordier, the American UN representative in the Congo, used his position to block communications by Lumumba's faction and to prevent a coordinated MNC-L reaction to the news. Both chambers of Parliament, however, supported Lumumba and denounced Kasa-Vubu's action. Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from his position, but could not get support for this, precipitating a constitutional crisis. Ostensibly in order to resolve the deadlock, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu launched a bloodless coup and replaced both Kasa-Vubu and Lumumba with a College of Commissionaires-General (\"Collège des Commissaires-généraux\") consisting of a panel of university graduates, led by Justin Bomboko. Soviet military advisors were ordered to leave. Allegedly, the coup was intended to force the politicians to take a cooling-off period before they could resume control. In practice, however, Mobutu sided with Kasa-Vubu against Lumumba, who was placed under house arrest, guarded by Ghanaian UN troops and an outer ring of ANC soldiers. Kasa-Vubu was re-appointed President by Mobutu in February 1961. From the coup onwards, Mobutu was able to exert considerable power in Congolese politics behind the scenes.\nFollowing Kasa-Vubu's reinstatement, there was an attempted rapprochement between the Congolese factions. Tshombe began negotiations for the end of the secession and the formation of a confederal Congo. Although a compromise agreement was reached, it was prevented from taking effect as negotiations broke down amid personal animosity between Kasa-Vubu and Tshombe. An attempted reconciliation in July 1961 led to the formation of a new government, led by Cyrille Adoula, which brought together deputies from both Lumumbist and South Kasai factions but also failed to bring a reconciliation with Katanga.\n\nMembers of the MNC-L fled to Stanleyville where, led by Antoine Gizenga, they formed a rebel government in November 1960 in opposition to the central government in Léopoldville. The Gizenga government was recognised by some states, including the Soviet Union and China, as the official government of the Congo and could call on an approximate 5,500 troops compared to the central government's 7,000. Faced with UN pressure, the Gizenga government however collapsed in January 1962 after Gizenga was arrested.\n\nLumumba escaped house arrest and fled eastwards towards Stanleyville where he believed he could rally support. Pursued by troops loyal to Mobutu, he was captured at Port Francqui on 1 December 1960 and flown back to Léopoldville with his hands bound. Despite UN appeals to Kasa-Vubu for due legal process, the Soviet Union denounced the UN as responsible for the arrest and demanded his release. A meeting of the UN Security Council was called on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the UN seek Lumumba's immediate release, his restoration to the head of the Congolese government and the disarming of Mobutu's forces. The pro-Lumumba resolution was defeated on 14 December 1960 by a vote of 8–2. Still in captivity, Lumumba was tortured and transported to Thysville and later to Katanga, where he was handed over to forces loyal to Tshombe. On 17 January 1961, Lumumba was executed by Katangese troops near Élisabethville.\n\nNews of the execution, released on 13 February, provoked international outrage. The Belgian Embassy in Yugoslavia was attacked by protesters in Belgrade, and violent demonstrations occurred in London and New York. Shortly thereafter seven Lumumbists, including the first President of Orientale Province, Jean-Pierre Finant, were executed in South Kasai for \"crimes against the Baluba nation\". Gizenga's soldiers then shot 15 political prisoners in retaliation, including Lumumba's dissident Minister of Communications, Alphonse Songolo.\n\nSince its initial resolution of July 1960, the UN had issued further resolutions calling for the total withdrawal of Belgian and mercenary forces from Katanga in progressively stronger terms. By 1961, ONUC comprised nearly 20,000 men. Although their mandate prevented them from taking sides, ONUC had a mandate to arrest foreign mercenaries wherever they encountered them. In September 1961, an attempt to detain a group of Katangese mercenaries without violence during Operation Morthor went wrong and turned into a fire-fight. ONUC's claim to impartiality was undermined in mid-September when a company of Irish UN troops were captured by numerically superior Katangese forces following a six-day siege in Jadotville. Katanga proceeded to hold the Irishmen as prisoners of war, a development that deeply embarrassed the UN mission and its proponents.\nOn 18 September 1961 Hammarskjöld flew to Ndola, just across the border in Northern Rhodesia, to attempt to broker a cease-fire between UN and Katangese forces. His aircraft crashed before landing at Ndola Airport, killing him and everybody else on board. In stark contrast to Hammarskjöld's attempts to pursue a moderate policy in the Congo, his successor U Thant supported a more radical policy of direct involvement in the conflict. Katanga released the captured Irish soldiers in mid-October as part of a cease-fire deal in which ONUC agreed to pull its troops back—a propaganda coup for Tshombe. Restated American support for the UN mission, and the murder of ten Italian UN pilots in Port-Émpain in November 1961, strengthened international demands to resolve the situation. In December 1961, South Kasai was finally overrun by ANC troops and Kalonji was arrested, ending the South Kasai secession.\nResolution 169, issued in November 1961, called for ONUC to respond to the deteriorating human rights situation and prevent the outbreak of full-scale civil war. The resolution \"completely rejected\" Katanga's claim to statehood and authorised ONUC troops to use all necessary force to \"assist the Central Government of the Congo in the restoration and maintenance of law and order\". The Katangese made further provocations and, in response, ONUC launched Operation Unokat to dismantle Katangese roadblocks and seize strategic positions around Élisabethville. Faced with international pressure, Tshombe signed the Kitona Declaration in December 1962 in which he agreed in principle to accept the authority of the central government and state constitution and to abandon any claim to Katangese independence. Following the declaration, however, talks between Tshombe and Adoula reached a deadlock, while Katangese forces continued to harass UN troops. Diminishing support and Belgium's increasing reluctance to support Katanga demonstrated that the state could not survive indefinitely. On 11 December 1962, Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak declared that the Belgian government would support the UN or the central Congolese government should they attempt to end the Katangese secession through force.\n\nOn 24 December 1962, UN troops and Katangese gendarmes clashed near Élisabethville and fighting broke out. After attempts to reach a ceasefire failed, UN troops launched Operation Grandslam and occupied Élisabethville, prompting Tshombe to leave the country. A ceasefire was agreed upon soon thereafter. Indian UN troops, exceeding their orders, then occupied Jadotville, preventing Katangese loyalists from regrouping. Gradually, the UN overran the rest of the Katanga and, on 17 January 1963, Tshombe surrendered his final stronghold of Kolwezi, effectively ending the Katangese secession.\n\nFollowing the end of the Katanga secession, political negotiations began to reconcile the disparate political factions. The negotiations coincided with the formation of an émigré political group, the \"Conseil National de Libération\" (CNL), by dissident Lumumbists and others in neighbouring Congo-Brazzaville. The negotiations culminated in the creation of a new, revised constitution, known as the Luluabourg Constitution, after the city in which it was written, to create a compromise balance of power. The new constitution increased the power of the presidency, ending the system of joint consultation between President and Prime Minister, and appeased federalists by increasing the number of provinces from six to 21 while increasing their autonomy. The constitution also changed the name of the state from the Republic of the Congo to Democratic Republic of the Congo. It was ratified in a constitutional referendum in June 1964 and Parliament was dissolved to await new elections. Kasa-Vubu appointed Tshombe, the exiled Katangese leader, as interim Prime Minister. Although personally capable, and supported as an anti-communist by Western powers, Tshombe was denounced by other African leaders such as King Hassan II of Morocco as an imperialist puppet for his role in the Katangese secession.\n\nUnder Tshombe's interim government, fresh elections were scheduled for 30 March and the rebellion broke out in the central and eastern parts of the Congo.\n\nThe period of political crisis had led to widespread disenchantment with the central government brought in by independence. Demands for a \"second independence\" from kleptocracy and political infighting in the capital grew. The \"second independence\" slogan was taken up by Maoist-inspired Congolese revolutionaries, including Pierre Mulele who had served in the Lumumba government. The political instability of the Congo helped to channel wider discontentment into outright revolt.\nDisruption in the rural Congo begun with agitation by Lumumbists, led by Mulele, among the Pende and Mbundu peoples. By the end of 1963, there was unrest in regions of the central and eastern Congo. The Kwilu Rebellion broke out on 16 January 1964 in the cities of Idiofa and Gungu in Kwilu Province. Further disruption and uprisings then spread to Kivu in the east and later to Albertville, sparking further insurrection elsewhere in the Congo and the outbreak of the larger Simba Rebellion. The rebels began to expand their territory and rapidly advance northwards, capturing Port-Émpain, Stanleyville, Paulis and Lisala between July and August.\n\nThe rebels, who called themselves \"Simbas\" (from the Kiswahili word for \"lion\"), had a populist but vague ideology, loosely based on communism, which prioritised equality and aimed to increase overall wealth. Most of the active revolutionaries were young men who hoped that the rebellion would provide them with opportunities which the government had not. The Simbas used magic to initiate members and believed that, by following a moral code, they could become invulnerable to bullets. Magic was also very important to the rebels who also made extensive use of witchcraft to protect themselves and also demoralise their ANC opponents. As they advanced, the rebels perpetrated numerous massacres in the territory they captured in order to remove political opposition and terrorise the population. ONUC was in the process of withdrawing when the rebellions started and had only 5,500 personnel, most whom were deployed in the eastern part of the country and stranded by the conflict. Straggling Western missionaries retreated to their respective embassies, which in turn requested UN assistance. A small force of peacekeepers was assembled and subsequently dispatched to the Kwilu region to retrieve fleeing missionaries. Rescue operations continued throughout March and April and resulted in the successful recovery of over 100 missionaries.\nThe rebels founded a state, the People's Republic of the Congo (\"République populaire du Congo\"), with its capital at Stanleyville and Christophe Gbenye as President. The new state was supported by the Soviet Union and China, which supplied it with arms, as did various African states, notably Tanzania. It was also supported by Cuba, which sent a team of over 100 advisors led by Che Guevara to advise the Simbas on tactics and doctrine. The Simba rebellion coincided with a wide escalation of the Cold War amid the Gulf of Tonkin incident and it has been speculated that, had the rebellion not been rapidly defeated, a full-scale American military intervention could have occurred as in Vietnam.\n\nAfter its early string of successes, the Simba rebellion began to encounter local resistance as it encroached on areas outside of the MNC-L's old domain. The People's Republic also suffered from a lack of coherent social and economic policy, contributing to an inability to administer its own territory. From the end of August 1964 the rebels began to lose ground to the ANC. Albertville and Lisala were recaptured in late August and early September. Tshombe, backed by Mobutu, recalled many of his former mercenaries from the Katangese secession to oppose the Simba. Mercenaries, led by \"Mad Mike\" Hoare and mostly whites from central and southern Africa, were formed into a unit known as 5 Commando ANC. The unit served as the spearhead of the ANC, but were known for widespread unsanctioned killing, torture, looting and mass rapes in recaptured rebel areas. In a press interview, Hoare himself described his men as \"appalling thugs\". The mercenaries were also materially supported by the CIA.\n\nIn November 1964, the Simbas rounded up the remaining white population of Stanleyville and its environs. The whites were held hostage in the Victoria Hotel in the city to use as bargaining tools with the ANC. In order to recover the hostages, Belgian parachute troops were flown to the Congo in American aircraft to intervene. On 24 November, as part of Operation Dragon Rouge, Belgian paratroopers landed in Stanleyville and quickly secured the hostages. In total, around 70 hostages and 1,000 Congolese civilians were killed but the vast majority were evacuated. The Belgian troops were only under orders to liberate the hostages, rather than push the Simbas out of the city, but the attack nevertheless \"broke the back of the eastern insurrection, which never recovered.\" The Simba leadership went into exile in disarray and severe disagreement; Gbenye was shot in the shoulder by his general after dismissing him. Meanwhile, the Belgian paratroopers and the civilians returned to their country. In the aftermath of the intervention, Belgium itself was publicly accused of neocolonialism.\n\nAs a result of the intervention, Tshombe lost the support of Kasa-Vubu and Mobutu and was dismissed from his post as prime minister in October 1965. Soon after \"Dragon Rouge\", ANC and mercenary troops captured Stanleyville, putting an end to the Simba rebellion. Pockets of Simba resistance continued to hold out in the eastern Congo, most notably in South Kivu, where Laurent-Désiré Kabila led a Maoist cross-border insurgency which lasted until the 1980s.\n\nIn the scheduled March 1965 elections, Tshombe's \"Convention Nationale Congolaise\" (CONACO) won a large majority of the seats, but a large part of his party soon defected to form the new \"Front Démocratique Congolais\" (FDC), making the overall result unclear as CONACO controlled the Chamber of Deputies while the FDC controlled the Senate. Kasa-Vubu, attempting to use the situation to block Tshombe, appointed an anti-Tshombe leader, Évariste Kimba of the FDC, to be prime minister-designate in November 1965, but the largely pro-Tshombe Parliament refused to ratify the appointment. Instead of seeking a compromise candidate, Kasa-Vubu again unilaterally declared Kimba to be Prime Minister, which was again rejected, creating a political deadlock. With the government in near-paralysis, Mobutu seized power in a bloodless coup, ostensibly to stop the impasse, on 25 November 1965.\n\nUnder the auspices of a \"régime d'exception\" (the equivalent of a state of emergency), Mobutu assumed sweeping, almost absolute, power for five years, after which, he claimed, democracy would be restored. Mobutu's coup, which promised both economic and political stability, was supported by the United States and other Western governments, and his rule initially met widespread popularity. He increasingly took other powers, abolishing the post of Prime Minister in 1966 and dissolving Parliament in 1967.\n\nOnce established as the sole source of political power, Mobutu gradually consolidated his control in the Congo. The number of provinces was reduced, and their autonomy curtailed, resulting in a highly centralised state. Mobutu increasingly placed his supporters in the remaining positions of importance. In 1967, to demonstrate his legitimacy, he created a party, the \"Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution\" (MPR), which until 1990, was the nation's only legal political party under Mobutu's new constitution. In 1971, the state was renamed Zaire and efforts were made to remove all colonial influences. He also nationalised the remaining foreign-owned economic assets in the country, including the UMHK which became \"Gécamines\". Despite initial successes, by the time of its disestablishment Mobutu's rule was characterised by widespread cronyism, corruption and economic mismanagement.\n\nIn the years after the Congo Crisis, Mobutu was able to remove many opposition figures from the crisis who might threaten his control. Tshombe was sent into a second exile in 1965 after being accused of treason. Between 1966 and 1967, two mutinies in Stanleyville broke out involving up to 800 Katangese gendarmes and former mercenaries of Tshombe. The mutinies were eventually repressed. In 1967, Tshombe was sentenced to death \"in absentia\" and the same year was kidnapped in an aeroplane hijacking and held under arrest in Algeria. His death in 1969, allegedly from natural causes, has provoked speculation that the Mobutu government may have been involved. Mulele was also lured back to the Congo from exile by the promise of an amnesty but was tortured and murdered.\n\nThe issues of federalism, ethnicity in politics and state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed to a decline in support for the concept of the state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government is one of the reasons that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism. Local insurgencies continued in the eastern Congo into the 1980s and left a legacy of instability along the Congo's eastern borders.\n\nLaurent-Désiré Kabila, who had led an anti-Mobutu insurrection during the crisis, succeeded in deposing Mobutu in 1997. His son, Joseph Kabila, is the incumbent president of the restored Democratic Republic of the Congo. Following the fall of Mobutu, Antoine Gizenga founded a political party, the \"Parti Lumumbiste Unifié\" (PALU), and was elected Prime Minister in 2006.\n\nThe Congo Crisis holds great significance in the collective memory of the Congolese people. In particular, Lumumba's murder is viewed in the context of the memory as a symbolic moment in which the Congo lost its dignity in the international realm and the ability to determine its future, which has since been controlled by the West. Many Congolese view the problems of the crisis as unresolved, and believe that the Congo's self-determination has yet to be secured from Western machinations. The latter notion has largely shaped the political aspirations of a substantial number of Congolese.\n\nThe presentation of the Congo Crisis, and particularly the role of Western intervention, has been controversial and academics have accused various governments of distortion. In Belgium, allegations of Belgian complicity in the killing of Lumumba led to a state-backed enquiry and subsequent official apology for \"moral responsibility\", though not direct involvement, in the assassination in 2001. In the United States, the multi-volume official history of the American foreign service, \"Foreign Relations of the United States\", was accused by academics of being deliberately misleading about American involvement in the crisis and in the installation of Mobutu.\nThe turmoil of the Congo Crisis destabilised Central Africa and helped to ignite the Portuguese Colonial War, especially the war of independence in neighbouring Angola. Angolan nationalists had long had close ties with the Congo where many had lived as exiles. The \"União dos Povos de Angola\" (UPA), an Angolan nationalist organisation which drew support from the Angolan Bakongo, was supporting ABAKO politicians who had hopes of rebuilding the Kingdom of Kongo, altering the borders established during the colonial period. Believing that the independence of Congo was the first stage in this process, the UPA launched the Baixa de Cassanje revolt in 1961, igniting the conflict in Angola that would last until 1974. The Congolese, later Zairian, governments continued to provide support to Angolan rebels and even participated directly in the subsequent Angolan Civil War.\nThe crisis caused the newly independent African states to reconsider their allegiances and internal ties. In particular, it led to the division of African states into factions. Moderate-leaning states joined the Brazzaville Group, which called for a degree of unity between Francophone African states and the maintenance of ties with France. Radical states joined the Casablanca Group which called for a Pan-African federation. The chaotic violence of the crisis and the fate of the country's whites, many of whom entered Northern and Southern Rhodesia as refugees, contributed to the widespread belief among whites there that black nationalist politicians were not ready to govern, and prompted fears that immediate majority rule in Rhodesia might lead to a similar situation. After negotiations with Britain repeatedly broke down, Southern Rhodesia's predominantly white government declared independence unilaterally in 1965.\n\nThe Katangese secession would prove to be politically influential in Africa. During the Chadian Civil War between 1965 and 1979, the \"Front de Libération Nationale du Tchad\" (FROLINAT) explicitly rejected secessionism in its bid to remove the southern-backed government of François Tombalbaye following the experience of the Katanga secession, officially stating that \"there will be no Katanga in Chad\". In the Nigerian Civil War, between 1967 and 1970, the ethnically Igbo region of Biafra seceded from Nigeria, which it accused of privileging the interests of northern ethnic groups and discriminating against the Igbo. The secessions of Biafra and Katanga have frequently been compared in academic writing. Unlike Katanga, Biafra achieved limited official international recognition and rejected the support of Western multinational companies involved in the local oil industry. Biafra was defeated in 1970 and re-integrated into Nigeria.\n\n\n\n\n"}

After this British Army evacuation, General George Washington triumphantly led the Continental Army from his former headquarters, north of the city, across the Harlem River, south down Manhattan, through the town to The Battery at the foot of Broadway.\n\nThe last shot of the war was reportedly fired on this day, as a British gunner fired a cannon at jeering crowds gathered on the shore of Staten Island, as his ship passed through the Narrows at the mouth of New York Harbor. The shot fell well short of the shore.\n\nFollowing the devastating losses at the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, General George Washington and the Continental Army retreated across the East River by benefit of both a retreat and holding action by well-trained Maryland Line troops at Gowanus Creek and Canal and a night fog which obscured the barges and boats evacuating troops to Manhattan Island. On September 15, 1776, the British flag replaced the American atop Fort George, where it was to remain until Evacuation Day.\n\nWashington's Continentals subsequently withdrew north and west out of the town and following the Battle of Harlem Heights and later action at the river forts of Fort Washington and Fort Lee on the northwest corner of the island along the Hudson River on November 16, 1776, evacuated Manhattan Island. They headed north for Westchester County, fought a delaying action at White Plains, and retreated across New Jersey in the New York and New Jersey campaign.\n\nFor the remainder of the American Revolutionary War, much of what is now Greater New York was under British control. New York City (occupying then only the southern tip of Manhattan, up to what is today Chambers Street), became, under Admiral of the Fleet Richard Howe, Lord Howe and his brother Sir William Howe, General of the British Army, the British political and military center of operations in British North America. David Mathews was Mayor of New York during the British occupation. Many of the civilians who continued to reside in town were Loyalists.\n\nOn September 21, 1776, the city suffered a devastating fire of uncertain origin after the evacuation of Washington's Continental Army at the beginning of the British Army occupation. With hundreds of houses destroyed, many residents had to live in makeshift housing built from old ships. In addition, over 10,000 Patriot soldiers and sailors died through deliberate neglect on prison ships in New York waters (Wallabout Bay) during the British occupation—more Patriots died on these ships than died in every single battle of the war, combined. These men are memorialized, and many of their remains are interred, at the Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument in Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn.\n\nIn mid-August 1783, Sir Guy Carleton, then the last British Army and Royal Navy commander in the former British North America, received orders from his superiors in London for the evacuation of New York. He informed the President of the Confederation Congress that he was proceeding with the subsequent withdrawal of refugees, liberated slaves, and military personnel as fast as possible, but that it was not possible to give an exact date because the number of refugees entering the city recently had increased dramatically (more than 29,000 Loyalist refugees eventually were evacuated from the city). The British also evacuated over 3,000 Black Loyalists, former slaves they had liberated from the Americans, to Nova Scotia, East Florida, the Caribbean, and London, and refused to return them to their American slaveholders and overseers as the provisions of the Treaty of Paris had required them to do. The Black Brigade were among the very last to depart.\n\nCarleton gave a final evacuation date of 12:00 noon on November 25, 1783. An anecdote by Alexander Anderson told of a scuffle between a British officer and the proprietress of a boarding house, as she defiantly raised her own American flag before noon. Following the departure of the British, the city was secured by American troops under the command of General Henry Knox.\n\nEntry into the city under General George Washington was delayed until after a British flag which could be seen still flying had been removed: a British Union Flag had been nailed to a flagpole at Fort George on the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan as a final act of defiance, and the pole was greased. After a number of men attempted to tear down the British colors, wooden cleats were cut and nailed to the pole and, with the help of a ladder, an army veteran, John Van Arsdale, was able to ascend the pole, remove the flag, and replace it with the Stars and Stripes before the British fleet had completely sailed out of sight. That same day, a liberty pole with a flag was erected at New Utrecht Reformed Church; its successor still stands there. Another liberty pole was raised in Jamaica, Queens, in a celebration that December.\n\nSeven years after the retreat from Manhattan on November 16, 1776, General George Washington and Governor of New York George Clinton reclaimed Fort Washington on the northwest corner of Manhattan Island and then led the Continental Army in a triumphal precision march down the road through the center of the island onto Broadway in the Town to the Battery. During his stay, Washington had a meeting with Hercules Mulligan, which helped dispel suspicions about the tailor and spy.\n\nA week later, on December 4, at Fraunces Tavern, at Pearl and Broad Streets, General Washington formally said farewell to his officers with a short statement, taking each one of his officers and official family by the hand.\n\nLater, Washington headed south, being cheered and fêted on his way at many stops in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. By December 23, he arrived in Annapolis, Maryland, where the Confederation Congress was then meeting at the Maryland State House to consider the terms of the Treaty of Paris. At their session in the Old Senate Chamber, he made a short statement and offered his sword and the papers of his commission to the President and the delegates, thereby resigning as commander-in-chief. He then retired to his plantation home, Mount Vernon, in Virginia.\n\nPublic celebrations were first held on the fourth anniversary in 1787, with the city's garrison performing a dress review and feu de joie, and in the context of a Federalist push for constitutional ratification following the Philadelphia Convention.\n\nThe British Fort George at Bowling Green was demolished in 1790, and in that year the Battery Flagstaff was built on newly reclaimed land on the Battery, called the \"churn\", operated by William and then Lois Keefe; this was replaced in 1809, and demolished about 1825. In 1809, the new flagstaff further east on the Battery with a decorative gazebo, which was operated as a concession. The Battery Flagstaff commemorated Evacuation Day, and was the site of the city's annual flag-raising celebration with a 50 x 100 foot flag for over a century. A flag-raising was held twice a year, on Evacuation Day and on the Fourth of July, and after 1853 flag-raisings on these days were also held at The Blockhouse.\n\nOn Evacuation Day 1790, the Veteran Corps of Artillery of the State of New York was founded.\n\nJohn Van Arsdale is said to have been a regular flag-raiser at the early commemorations. \n\nWashington Irving described a September 1804 visit to the commemorative flagpole, as \"The standard of our city, reserved, like a choice handkerchief, for days of gala, hung motionless on the flag-staff, which forms the handle to a gigantic churn,\" in his \"A History of New York\".\n\nThe Scudder's American Museum / Barnum's American Museum held what it claimed was the original 1783 Evacuation Day flag until the museum's burning in 1865, and flew it on Evacuation Day and the Fourth of July.\n\nOn Evacuation Day 1811, the newly completed Castle Clinton was dedicated with the firing of its first gun salute. \n\nOn Evacuation Day 1830 (or rather, on November 26 due to inclement weather), thirty thousand New Yorkers gathered on a march to Washington Square Park in celebration of that year's July Revolution in France.\n\nFor over a century the event was commemorated annually with patriotic and political connotations, as well as embracing a general holiday atmosphere. Sometimes featured were greasy pole climbing contests for boys to recreate the taking the down the Union Jack. Evacuation Day also became a time for theatrical spectacle, with for example an 1832 Bowery Theatre double bill of Junius Brutus Booth and.Thomas D. Rice. David Van Arsdale is said to have raised the flag after his father's death in 1836. There was also a traditional parade from near the current Cooper Union down the Bowery to the Battery.\n\nThe importance of the commemoration was waning in 1844, with the approach of the Mexican–American War of 1846–1848.\n\nHowever, the dedication of the monument to William J. Worth, the Mexican–American War general, at Madison Square was purposely held on Evacuation Day 1857.\n\nIn August 1863, the Battery Flagstaff was destroyed by a lightning strike; it was subsequently replaced.\n\nBefore it was a national holiday, Thanksgiving was proclaimed at various dates by state governors – as early as 1847, New York held Thanksgiving on the same date as Evacuation Day, a convergence happily noted by Walt Whitman, writing in the \"Brooklyn Eagle\". The observance of the date was also diminished by the Thanksgiving Day Proclamation by 16th President Abraham Lincoln on October 3, 1863, that called on Americans \"in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea and those who are sojourning in foreign lands, to set apart and observe the last Thursday of November next as a day of thanksgiving.\" That year, Thursday fell on November 26. In later years, Thanksgiving was celebrated on or near the 25th, making Evacuation Day redundant.\n\nOn Evacuation Day 1864, the Booth brothers held a performance of \"Julius Caesar\" at the Winter Garden Theatre to raise funds for the Shakespeare statue later placed in Central Park. That same day, Confederate saboteurs attempted to burn down the city, lighting an adjoining building on fire, and for a time disturbing the performance.\n\nA traditional children's rhyme of the era was:\"It's Evacuation Day, when the British ran away,<br>Please, dear Master, give us holiday!\n\nOver time, the celebration and its anti-British sentiments became associated with the local Irish American community.\n\nIn the 1890s, the anniversary was celebrated in New York at Battery Park with the raising of the Stars and Stripes by Christopher R. Forbes, the great grandson of John Van Arsdale, with the assistance of a Civil War veterans' association from Manhattan—the Anderson Zouaves. John Lafayette Riker, the original commander of the Anderson Zouaves, was also a grandson of John Van Arsdale. Riker's older brother was the New York genealogist James Riker, who authored \"Evacuation Day, 1783\" for the spectacular 100th anniversary celebrations of 1883, which were ranked as “one of the great civic events of the nineteenth century in New York City.” David Van Arsdale had died in November 1883 just before the centennial, having helped revive the event the year previous, and he was succeeded by his grandson.\n\nAs part of Evacuation Day celebrations in 1883 (on November 26), the \"George Washington\" statue by Federal Hall was unveiled.\n\nOn Evacuation Day 1893, the \"Nathan Hale\" statue currently in City Hall Park was unveiled.\n\nIn 1895, Asa Bird Gardiner disputed the rights to organize the flag-raising, claiming that his organization, the General Society of the War of 1812, were the true heirs of the Veteran Corps of Artillery.\n\nIn 1900, Christopher R. Forbes was denied the honor of raising the flag at the Battery on Independence Day and on Evacuation Day and it appears that neither he nor any Veterans' organization associated with the Van Arsdale-Riker family or the Anderson Zouaves took part in the ceremony after this time. In 1901, Forbes raised the flag at the dedication of Bennett Park. Following the warming of relations with Britain immediately preceding World War I, the observance all but disappeared.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the flagpole used was that from the 1901 America's Cup defender \"Constitution\". The commemorative flagpole was still listed as an attraction in a Federal Writers' Project city guide as late as 1939, and the annual flag-raising ceremony lasted until the 1950s.\n\nThe event was officially celebrated for the last time on November 25, 1916 with a march down Broadway for a flag raising ceremony by sixty members of the Old Guard. The position of the flagstaff at this time was described as near Battery Park's sculptures of John Ericsson and Giovanni da Verrazzano. The flagpole was included on a map of Battery Park in the WPA \"New York City Guide\" of 1939. It was removed sometime in midcentrury. Later, City Council President Paul O'Dwyer expressed interest in a restored flagpole for the 1976 United States Bicentennial. A bicentennial of Evacuation Day in 1983 featured the labor leader Harry Van Arsdale, Jr. A commemorative plaque marking Evacuation Day was put on a flagpole at Bowling Green in 1996.\n\nThe Sons of the Revolution fraternal organization continues to hold an annual 'Evacuation Day Dinner' at Fraunces Tavern.\n\nThough little celebrated in the previous century, the 225th anniversary of Evacuation Day was commemorated on November 25, 2008, with searchlight displays in New Jersey and New York at key high points. The searchlights are modern commemorations of the bonfires that served as a beacon signal system at many of these same locations during the revolution. The seven New Jersey Revolutionary War sites are Beacon Hill in Summit, South Mountain Reservation in South Orange, Fort Nonsense in Morristown, Washington Rock in Green Brook, the Navesink Twin Lights, Princeton, and Ramapo Mountain State Forest near Oakland. The five New York locations which contributed to the celebration are; Bear Mountain State Park, Storm King State Park, Scenic Hudson's Spy Rock (Snake Hill) in New Windsor, Washington's Headquarters State Historic Site in Newburgh, Scenic Hudson's Mount Beacon.\nThe renaming of a portion of Bowling Green, a street in Lower Manhattan to Evacuation Day Plaza was proposed by Arthur R. Piccolo, the chairman of the Bowling Green Association, and James S. Kaplan of the Lower Manhattan Historical Society. The proposal was initially turned down by the New York City Council in 2016 because the Council's rules for street renaming specify that a renamed street must commemorate a person, an organization, or a cultural work. However, with the support of Councilwoman Margaret Chin, and after supporters of the renaming pointed to streets and plazas named after \"Do the Right Thing Way\", \"Diversity Plaza\", \"Hip Hop Boulevard\", and \"Ragamuffin Way\", the council reversed its decision and approved the renaming of the street on February 5, 2016.\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n\n"}

Explo '72 has been called the most visible event of the 1970s Jesus movement, and came to be associated with the same, even though its primary attendees were not directly involved in that movement.\n\nIt was held in various locations in Dallas, Texas from June 12 to June 17, 1972, with a nightly gathering in the Cotton Bowl. Its goal was to gather 100,000 high school and college students together to train them in personal evangelism, with a vision toward world evangelism, and to encourage attendees to seek some form of Christian service career.\n\nAttendance at the daytime conference was estimated at 80,000, with about 95% from a white background, fewer than 3000 black attendees, and an international representation of 75 countries. Most of these were middle class high school and college students.\n\nThe daily schedule included evangelism classes and seminars in the daytime, with hands-on exercises in the afternoon. Nightly events at Cotton Bowl features bands, well known preachers, and pro players from various sporting teams.\n\nBilly Graham spoke on six different occasions during the event including the final event which was a public, eight-hour-long, Christian music festival on Saturday, June 17, 1972. Dubbed \"The Christian Woodstock\", the event drew an estimated attendance between 100,000 and 200,000. \"Newsweek\" described the crowds as being \"militant Christians.\" Featured artists were Love Song, Larry Norman, Randy Matthews, The Archers, Children of the Day, Johnny Cash, and Kris Kristofferson. The festival was held on a huge open swath of land just north of downtown Dallas that had been cleared for construction of the Woodall Rodgers Freeway. The excavation for this highway linking Interstate 35 and US75 would forever obliterate the festival site. Portions of this event were recorded and released on the 1972 album Jesus Sound Explosion. Included on the album were performances by artists as diverse as Johnny Cash, Andrae Crouch and The Disciples, Willa Dorsey, The Speer Family, and Armageddon Experience.\n\nMany conservative Christian groups were critical of Explo '72 for its ecumenical involvement with both Protestant and Roman Catholic ministries, and for its use of rock music. The event attracted Jesus movement fringe groups, including the Children of God and the Christian World Liberation Front.\n\nThe long-term impact of Explo '72 is difficult to measure. The most obvious and lasting effect was the influence of Jesus music, which would later be more commonly called Contemporary Christian Music. At least one critic credits the event with spawning the entire Christian music industry.\n\nMaynard Pittendreigh, who attended the event as a recent high school graduate, did a limited study when working on his Master of Divinity degree in which he analyzed the long-term effects of large scale evangelistic events. Gathering information from churches from South Carolina that had sent youth groups to the event, he was able to demonstrate that more than 60% of those participants had entered the ordained ministry, were engaged in theological training, or had become missionaries.\n\nDavid Hill Scott, writing for the May, 2005, edition of \"Christianity Today\", documented the effects Explo '72 had on Pope John Paul II. As a cardinal in Poland, the future Pope was heavily influenced toward evangelistic efforts by Joe Losiak, a Polish American student who had attended Explo '72 and introduced its concepts to Roman Catholic officials in Poland.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11039668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11039668", "title": "Festival Internacional Cervantino", "text": "Festival Internacional Cervantino\n\n-The Festival Internacional Cervantino (FIC), popularly known as \"El Cervantino\", takes place each fall in the city of Guanajuato, located in central Mexico. This is a small colonial-era city with history of having a large cultural scene. The origins of the festival are from the mid 20th century, when short plays by Miguel de Cervantes called \"entremeses\" (singular \"entremés\") were performed in the city’s plazas. In 1972, this was expanded with federal support to include more events to add a more international flavor. Since then, FIC has grown to become the most important international artistic and cultural event in Mexico and Latin America, and one of four major events of its type in the world. It is a member of the European Festivals Association and the Asian Association of Theater Festivals In addition to government support, there are also private sponsors such as Telmex, Televisa and Microsoft.\n\nThe city of Guanajuato, where the Festival takes place, has historically had a large cultural scene in relation to its size. The richness of the mines in colonial times started a tradition of theaters and other cultural venues to satisfy the desires of the middle and upper classes. The city has a tradition of hosting musical, theatrical and dance events not only in its numerous theaters but also in its many small plazas with benches.\n\nIn 1953, Enrique Ruelas of the University of Guanajuato began to put on an annual event called the Entremeses de Miguel de Cervantes Saaevedra, short plays written by the author of Don Quixote. These plays are still part of the annual Festival. In 1972, he founded the Coloquio Cervantino from June to September to expand the annual Entremeses event. Ruelas's efforts came to the attention of the federal government through actress Dolores del Río. While in the city of Guanajuato, she came across the Entremeses being performed at the Plaza San Roque and was fascinated. Around the same time, former president Luis Echeverría had attended cultural festivals in Europe and was interested in doing something similar in Mexico. Through Echeverría's cousin, Del Río relayed what she had seen in Guanajuato. The federal government then established the foundation for an international cultural festival, originally proposing it for Acapulco. However, the tradition of the Entremeses was the main reason why Guanajuato was eventually chosen, meshing the two ideas to produce the modern event for the first time in 1972 with performances by artists from fourteen countries including Mexico. For this reason, this year is considered the foundation of the event.\n\nThe Festival in its current form was a governmental effort, with the 1972 edition attracting interest solely because of the influence of the politicians promoting it. The Cervantino had its greatest growth from 1976 to 1982, during the presidency of José López Portillo because of the efforts of his wife, Carmen Romano, who promoted it abroad. It quickly gained the attention of noted artists, with Berlin Philharmonic director Herbert von Karajan offering to appear at no cost. Initially the city of Guanajuato had difficulties in hosting the event due to the lack of infrastructure.\n\nElizabeth II and the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh attended the event in 1975. By decree, an organizing committee was set up in 1976 under the Secretaría de Educación Pública, the state and city of Guanajuato and the University of Guanajuato to invite artists from Mexico and abroad. Some of the first invited by this committee were Mario Moreno Cantinflas and Dolores del Río. This committee is still in charge today, working with the Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes, el Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes and the Instituto de Cultura de Guanajuato. In 1978, Juan Carlos and Sofía of Spain attended as guests of honor.\n\nInitially, the city of Guanajuato was only the host, with local artistic groups not participating in the event. However, efforts were soon made to lobby for their inclusion, especially by the Universidad de Guanajuato, and now artists from this university and other parts of the city and state regularly appear.\n\nSince 1982, the festival has diminished somewhat in size, mostly because of reduced funding. Another issue that arose was that the festival had become very popular with backpackers, who slept in the streets and caused problems for local residents. However, it remained a very important event, attracting notable acts and up to 140 journalists to cover it. In the 1980s, these included Lazar Berman, Mercedes Sosa, the New York Philharmonic, Joan Baez, Gilbert Bécaud, Mario Lavista, Guillermo Velázquez, Los Leones de la Sierra de Xichú, the National Ballet of Canada, Nikolais Dance Theater, the Bolshoi Ballet, Sankai Juku, Theater Scena STU (Poland) and the Marionette Theatre of Hungary.\n\nIn 1989, the city became a World Heritage Site which allowed most of the city’s colonial and late 19th-century architecture, including its theatres, to be restored.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the festival featured acts such as the Guitar Trio of Amsterdam, Voices of Change, the Vienna Quintet, Guadalupe Pineda, Krzysztof Jakowicz, Krystyna Borucinska, Kronos Quartet, Madredeus, the Open Theater of Belgrade, the Lindsay Kemp Company and the Royal Shakespeare Company.\n\nIn the 2000s, the custom of having Mexican states and foreign countries and regions as “special guests” began. In 2001, the invited region was Oceania along with Veracruz. Acts featured during those years included Hélène Grimaud, Eugenio Toussaint, Juan Fornell and Los Van Van, the Vienna Symphony Virtuosi, Enrique Bunbury, Los Tigres del Norte, Panteón Rococó, Meno Fortas and Les 7 doigts de la main.\n\nThe city was declared the Cervantino Capital of America in 2005, which prompted the federal government to issue a commemorative silver coin.\n\nHowever, problems with the lack of funds and organizational issues brought the event to a crisis by 2006. There were structural and financial changes made during the rest of that decade, and by 2010, the Festival was able to recuperate much of its former status, attracting major artists from around the world. However, problems with large crowds of mostly young people, drinking in public remains a problem, especially for the local populace.\n\nThe 38th edition of the Festival in 2010 was dedicated to Mexico’s Bicentennial of Independence and Centennial of the Revolution. Three states, Chihuahua, Michoacán and Querétaro, along with three countries, Argentina, Colombia and Chile, were the special guests as they celebrated their bicentennials in the same year. The 2010 version had 3,161 artists from 31 countries, with special emphasis on traditional Mexican music and dance.\n\nThe 2011 version brought together 2,800 artists from 29 countries, in genres such as classical and folk music to techno, open-air theatre, expositions, recent plays and other works from the 20th century by well-known writers. It is dedicated to the environment, with a theme of “The Gifts of Nature” and special guests Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway and Nayarit. Artists include The Oslo Camerata, Geir Henning Braaten, Knut Reiersrud, Mari Boine, a dramatization of \"Il Postino\" by Pablo Neruda, the Saint Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra focusing on 19th century Russian music, especially Tchaikovsky, the DeMUG Baroque Ensemble, and an exhibition of Oaxacan painter Francisco Toledo in the Museo del Pueblo. The 2011 event cost 122 million pesos to set up, with most of the money coming from CONACULTA and the rest from the state of Guanajuato, the University of Guanajuato and the city of Guanajuato.\n\nThe 2014 performance was opened by taiko drumming group Tokyo Dagekidan, a performance attended by Japan's Prince Fumihito Akishino and his wife Kiko.\n\nThe events happen in the forty nine theatres, plazas and other venues in the city, with satellite events in other plazas in the state and other cities in the country. The Festival in the city of Guanajuato takes advantage of these numerous venues, indoor and outdoor which include the Teatro Juárez, the Teatro Principal, the Teatro Cervantes, the Patio of the Faculty of Industrial Relations, the State Auditorium, the Plaza San Roque, the Esplanade of the Alhondiga, the Teatro de Minas, the Valenciana Church and the Ex-Hacienda of San Gabriel de Barrera. In addition, seven museum spaces are used for exhibitions such as those of photography.\n\nThe event represents a tourist and economic windfall for the city, which brought in 423 million pesos in 2010, a 57% increase over 2009 with hotel occupancy alone up 39%. The total number of visitors in 2010 is estimated at 179,000, with 463,000 tickets to events sold. In addition to the events in Guanajuato proper, there were another 125,000 attendees to related activities in 37 cities and seventeen states in Mexico.\n\nBeing named after Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, the Festival has a special emphasis on artistic creations in the Spanish language, with the original tradition of performing this writer’s “entremeses” plays upheld by the University Theater of Guanajuato. The international aspect is to create a space for discovery and exchange. The Ballet Folklorico de Mexico under Amalia Hernández has performed every year since the beginning. Acts have been booked from all parts of the world of a wide variety from classical music, Mexican folk dance, Chinese acrobats and more. The event attracts artists from all over the world each year in order to present typical aspects of culture from each country. Acts include those from genres such as opera, music, dance, theatre, street spectaculars, visual arts, film and literature along with various academic events. The Festival has an agreement with the MUTEK Festival of Montreal with the aim of presenting newer acts to the audiences in Mexico especially in the field of electronic music.\n\nIn 2010, the Presea FIC was instituted to recognize the work of Mexican and foreign artists for their contributions to culture. The prize is symbolized by a statue designed by Vicente Rojo, which is awarded during the opening ceremonies. The first was awarded to Luis Herrera de la Fuente.\n\nTo promote a link between culture and technology, the Festival and Microsoft México sponsor a Technology Pavilion at the Mesón de San Antonio. It is planned to contain an Internet café with large lounge chairs and wireless services for those with mobile devices. Microsoft sponsors a set of academic lectures about what’s new in technology and art, games and everyday life.\n\nMuch of the festival is set up to attract young people from children to university age. The Cervantino Program for Youth sponsors programs for this age group as well as other activities. It has an annual Artistic Creativity Contest for Youth put on in collaboration with the Edinburgh International Festival and The Anglo Mexican Foundation. Two activities in 2010 were a contest of photos taken with cell phones and another contest of short electronic music pieces, both of which were launched over the Internet. Winners received trips to the Edinburgh International Festival, the first and largest international cultural event of its type in the world. A number of performers and academic activities are scheduled with young audiences in mind. These include rock and electronic music concerts with dance and theater events. In 2011, these included German electronic music groups Moonbootica and Schlachthofbronx sponsored by the Goethe Institute and rock musicians Sierra León, Finde, El Otro Yo and Rubick . Theatre for youth include Vivarium Studio performing L éffet de Serge, Mauricio García Lozano and Teatro Farfullero presenting La pequeña habitación al final de la escalera and Circo Aereo and Les Objets Volants, a Finnish/French group with acrobats, comedians and other circus performers. Other events for youth include DJ Frivolous and DJ Kid Koala from Canada and German artist Brandt Brauer Frick who mixes electronic and acoustic sounds. University students can get up to a 73% discount on tickets for selected acts. There is an event to bring together children and Mexican poets and a performance of A magic flute for children by the French ensamble Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord.\n\nIn 2011, the Festival scheduled its first Art Book Fair, focusing on books about the visual and theatrical arts.\n\nBased on the program sponsored by the Lucerne Festival, the Cervantino Academy’s purpose is to train professional level instrumentalists in classical and contemporary music. The program sponsors individual students, classes, workshops, practice sessions and concerts, including at the Festival Cervantino, both by small ensembles as well as in an orchestra. Participants are under thirty and are selected by audition. The program has invited maestros from both Mexico and abroad, including Irvine Arditti, Steve Schick, Norio Sato and Salvatore Sciarrino. The program attracts students from various countries in Latin America, including Guatemala, Brazil, Cuba, and Bolivia as well as Mexico.\n\nPrior Festival events and shows related to artists scheduled to perform in upcoming festivals are shown through the Festival’s television, radio and website. A channel called TV FIC or Canal Cervantino was created on channel 157 of Cablevision to broadcast archived footage of past festivals and performances by those scheduled to perform the upcoming year. Microsoft sponsors the Festival’s web page as well as an online radio station called Radio FIC which offers online archives of music, video and photographic works, as well as a various types of informative material.\n\nMost of the events related to the Festival occur in Guanajuato, but some events such as dance, plays and concerts are presented live or are transmitted to other areas of the country. These include national and international acts. The Más Allá de Guanajuato (Beyond Guanajuato) program to bring Cervantino cultural events to other parts of the country, free to the public. As of 2014, the program has sponsored events in over 100 venues in 26 states and the Federal District. These include schools, cultural center, libraries and correctional institutions. Much of this activity is made possible through a collaboration with CONACULTA and the Secretaría de Educación Pública.\n\nThe Ruelos Project, named after the founder of the Entremeses Cervantinos, was created in 2014 to pair artists with disadvantaged communities. The Festival provides logistical support but the actors and support staff are locals with that thirty participants in each event. The project is based on the original Entremeses Cervantinos done by Enrique Ruelos starting in the 1950s which relied on community participation to produce plays such as those by Shakespeare but modified to the local culture. The performances are planned and executed with communities where there are high levels of crime and family instability and violence, mostly in the state of Guanajuato. They have also worked with prison populations.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13676128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13676128", "title": "Folly Theatre", "text": "Folly Theatre\n\nThe Folly Theatre was a London theatre of the late 19th century, in William IV Street, near Charing Cross, in the City of Westminster. It was converted from the house of a religious order, and became a small theatre, with a capacity of 900 seated and standing. The theatre specialised in presenting music hall, burlesque and opera bouffe. The Beefsteak Club had quarters above the theatre.\n\nAs a stock company, under the direction first of Alexander Henderson and Lydia Thompson and then of John Lawrence Toole, the theatre was significant for beginning the professional careers of many Victorian era actors, writers and actor-managers. The theatre was demolished in 1895, possibly due to disturbance caused to the neighbouring Charing Cross Hospital.\n\nThe building opened as the \"Lowther Rooms\" in 1840. It was the residence of the \"Fathers of the London Oratory of St. Philip Neri\" from 1848–56 and was used for lectures. Here, in 1850, John Henry Newman delivered his \"Lectures on Anglican Difficulties\", after his conversion to Catholicism. On the departure of the religious order, which moved to the \"Brompton Oratory\", the hall became \"Woodin's Polygraphic Hall\" in 1855, where William S. Woodin gave monologue entertainments.\n\nIn 1869, the building was converted to a small Music hall and playhouse called the \"Royal Charing Cross Theatre\" and, in 1872 was renamed the Charing Cross Theatre and was advertised as the Theatre Royal, Charing Cross, in 1874-75. The theatre opened on 19 June 1869 with W. S. Gilbert's burlesque of \"Norma\", called \"The Pretty Druidess\", on the bill, and in 1870 it held Gilbert and Frederic Clay's \"The Gentleman in Black\". In 1872, it hosted J. S. Clarke's revival of Sheridan's \"The Rivals\", featuring Mrs Stirling in the role that was to make her famous as \"Mrs Malaprop\". The name \"Charing Cross Music Hall\" was also adopted in the late 1880s by the brothers Carlo and Giovanni Gatti for their \"Gatti's-Under-the-Arches Music hall\". This became the Hungerford Music Hall in 1883, later returning to the former name.\n\nAfter some rebuilding, by architect Thomas Verity, the theatre was renamed \"The Folly Theatre\" in 1876, when it was bought by Alexander Henderson, and it became a burlesque house, with his wife, Lydia Thompson, in the lead roles. The first piece was a successful burlesque of \"Blue Beard\". In 1877, \"Up the River, or the Strict Kew-Tea\", by H. B. Farnie and Robert Reece played at the theatre as did a Farnie and Reece adaptation of Offenbach called \"The Creole\".\n\nIn 1878, the theatre had a tremendous success with Violet Cameron in Robert Planquette's \"Les cloches de Corneville\", adapted by Farnie and Reece, which (after transferring to the Globe Theatre and returning to the Folly), held the record for long runs in musical theatre for a decade. Florence St. John got her start in the piece on tour and then in the theatre. Farnie and Reece's burlesque \"Stars and Garters\" then played. Reece's successful burlesque, \"Carmen; or Sold for a Song\", and Sydney Grundy's \"After Long Years\" both played at the theatre in 1879. T. W. Roberton's \"Dublin Bay\" played here in 1880. The theatre was described in \"Dickens Dictionary of London\" (1879) as \"A little bandbox of a place, very prettily fitted up, and with a decided speciality for burlesque and opera bouffe\".\nOn 7 November 1879, John Lawrence Toole (1830-1906) took over the management, with a stock company. Presentations included farces, burlesques and travesties of popular plays, beginning with H. J. Byron's \"A Fool and His Money\". Toole's only son, Frank, died on 7 December 1879 following an earlier football injury from which he never fully recovered. Toole was both a noted comedian and a friend of Charles Dickens. He spent much of the next few years touring, but also produced plays at the theatre, including Arthur Wing Pinero's \"Hester's Mystery\" (1880) and Byron's \"Upper Crust and Auntie\" (1880), Dion Boucicault's play, \"Dot\", starring Toole, was produced here in 1881.\n\nIn 1882, after further rebuilding, Toole re-opened the theatre as Toole's Theatre, becoming the first actor to have a West End theatre named after him. Noted actress Florence Farr (1860-1917) began her professional career with an apprenticeship at Toole's theatre, débuting with a juvenile role in Byron's \"Uncle Dick's Darling\", in 1882. In 1883, \"Stage Dora; or, Who Killed Cock Robin\", a burlesque by F. C. Burnand of Sardou's \"Fédora\", premiered at Toole's, starring Toole. Burnand's \"Paw Claudian\" (1884) was a burlesque of the 1883 costume (Byzantine) drama 'Claudian' by Henry Herman and W. G. Wills. \"Mr. Guffin’s Elopement\" and \"The Great Tay-Kin\", two shows with words by Arthur Law and music by George Grossmith, starring Toole, played at the theatre in 1885. The last play by John Maddison Morton to be produced in his lifetime, a three-act farcical comedy called \"Going It\", played at Toole's in 1885 and kept the house in a continual roar of laughter. Pinero's \"Girls and Boys\" played here in 1885, as did \"Billee Taylor\" in 1886 and \"The Butler\", by Herman Charles Merivale, starring Toole, also in 1886. \"Pepita\", an operetta by Charles Lecocq, premiered at the theatre in 1888. \"The Don\", by Merivale, also starred Toole in 1888.\n\n\"The Bungalow\", by Fred Horner, played at the theatre in 1890. \"Ibsen's Ghost\", a one-act parody on \"Ghosts\", starring Irene Vanbrugh and Toole, was J. M. Barrie's first London play, running for just 27 performances at Toole's Theatre from 30 May 1891. In 1892, Toole directed the première of Barrie's first hit play, \"Walker, London\", which ran for 497 performances.\n\nToole retired in 1893, due to increasing ill health, brought on by the deaths within a few years of his family. His last piece was \"Thoroughbred\" by Ralph Lumley, and upon his retirement Rutland Barrington replaced him in the role. The theatre was taken over by Violet Melnotte, who had made her début at the Folly Theatre in October 1876 as \"Fezz\" in \"Bluebeard\" with Lydia Thompson's Company. She had many interests and at the same time was building the Duke of York's Theatre, with her husband Frank Wyatt.\n\nThe lease expired in 1895 and plans were drawn up by C. J. Phipps to rebuild the theatre, but they were opposed, apparently because the noise at the theatre disturbed patients at the Charing Cross Hospital. The theatre was demolished in 1896 and the site used to extend Charing Cross Hospital. The site is now a part of the Charing Cross Police Station.\n"}
{"id": "2478240", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2478240", "title": "Forced molting", "text": "Forced molting\n\nForced molting, sometimes known as induced molting, is the practice by some poultry industries of artificially provoking a flock to molt simultaneously, typically by withdrawing food for 7–14 days and sometimes also withdrawing water for an extended period. Forced molting is usually implemented when egg-production is naturally decreasing toward the end of the first egg-laying phase. During the forced molt, the birds cease producing eggs for at least two weeks, which allows the bird's reproductive tracts to regress and rejuvenate. After the molt, the hen's egg production rate usually peaks slightly lower than the previous peak, but egg quality is improved. The purpose of forced molting is therefore to increase egg production, egg quality, and profitability of flocks in their second or subsequent laying phases, by not allowing the hen's body the necessary time to rejuvenate during the natural cycle of feather replenishment. \n\nThe practice is controversial. While it is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU.\n\nCommercial hens usually begin laying eggs at 16–20 weeks of age, although production gradually declines soon after from approximately 25 weeks of age. This means that in many countries, by approximately 72 weeks of age, flocks are considered economically unviable and are slaughtered after approximately 12 months of egg production, although chickens will naturally live for 6 or more years. However, in some countries, rather than being slaughtered, the hens are force molted to re-invigorate egg-laying for a second, and sometimes subsequent, laying phase.\n\nForced molting simulates the natural process where chickens grow a new set of feathers in the Autumn, a process generally accompanied by a sharp reduction or cessation of egg production. Natural molting is stimulated by shortening day lengths combined with stress (of any kind). Before confinement housing with artificial lights was the norm, the Autumn molt caused a seasonal scarcity of eggs and high market prices. Farmers attempted to pamper their flocks to prevent the molt as long as possible, to take advantage of the high prices. Modern controlled-environment confinement housing has the opposite problem; the hens are not normally presented with sufficient stress or cues to go into molt naturally. However, after laying almost daily for nearly a year, their rate of egg production declines, as does the quality of the eggshell and the egg contents. In addition, the hens are overweight.\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that forced molting is an artifact of modern intensive farming, but the practice predates the vertical integration of the poultry industry by decades; former Head of the Poultry Science Department at the University of Maryland, Morley A. Jull prescribes a precise molting program in his 1938 book, \"Poultry Husbandry\".\n\nFor a complete recovery of the reproductive tract, the hen's body weight must drop by 30 to 35 percent during the forced molt. This is typically achieved by withdrawing the hen's feed for 7–14 days, sometimes up to 28 days. This induces the birds to lose their feathers, cease to lay eggs and lose body-weight. Some programs combine feed withdrawal with a period of water withdrawal. Most programs also restrict the amount of lighting to provide a daylight period that is too short to stimulate egg production, providing a simulated autumn, the natural time of molt and minimum egg production. \n\nForced molting programs sometimes follow other variations. Some do not eliminate feed altogether, but may induce a molt by providing a low-density diet (e.g. grape pomace, cotton seed meal, alfalfa meal) or dietary manipulation to create an imbalance of a particular nutrient(s). The most important among these include manipulation of minerals including sodium, calcium, iodine and zinc, with full or partially reduced dietary intakes. These alternative methods of forced molting have not been widely used by the egg industries. \nIn 2003, more than 75% of all flocks in the US were molted.\n\nSome birds die during forced molting and it has been recommended that the flock must be managed so that mortality does not exceed 1.25% over the 1–2 weeks of (nearly complete) feed withdrawal, compared to a 0.5% to 1.0% monthly mortality in a well-managed flock under low-stress conditions. Alternative methods of forced molting which do not use total food withdrawal, e.g. creating a dietary mineral imbalance, generally result in lower mortality rates.\n\nTemporary starvation of the hens is considered by many to be inhumane as well as a form of animal cruelty, and is the main objection of critics and opponents of the practice. \n\nWhile forced molting is widespread in the US, it is prohibited in the EU. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states \"In no circumstances may birds be induced to moult by withholding feed and water.\" Forced molting is not a common practice in Canada, where the animal welfare issues associated with it have rendered it basically obsolete.\n\nForced molting increases plasma corticosterone which, along with related hormones, decreases the levels of circulating lymphocytes and other leukocytes, thereby reducing the effectiveness of the bird's immune system. This means that birds being force molted become susceptible to disease, particularly \"Salmonella\" infections, and may produce contaminated eggs thereby compromising public health.\n\n"}

{"id": "3754445", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3754445", "title": "Illinois State Fair", "text": "Illinois State Fair\n\nThe Illinois State Fair is an annual festival, centering on the theme of agriculture, hosted by the U.S. state of Illinois in the state capital, Springfield. The state fair has been celebrated almost every year since 1853. In 2018 369,144 visits were tallied. This marked a sharp decline from the more than 700,000 visitors counted in 2008, when the fair had been the 13th largest state fair in the United States. Currently, the fair is held annually at the Illinois State Fairgrounds over an 11-day period in mid-August of each year. In 2018, the State Fair was held from August 9-19, and an admission fee was charged.\n\nThe first Illinois State Fair was celebrated in 1853 in Springfield. In that first year, the admission fee was 25 cents. The fair moved to Chicago in 1855. The 1850s were a golden age of agricultural journalism, with a wide variety of editors offering many suggestions, well-founded or not, to increase farm productivity. The first State Fairs, in Illinois and other states, were created and organized by farmers in order to compare notes with their colleagues and distinguish between good and bad advice.\nDuring the years after the Civil War, the rules of agricultural judging became standardized, and more and more farmers began to show their farm products. Increasing knowledge of genetics inspired the breeding and showing of purebred farm animals at both county fairs and the Illinois State Fair.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the internal combustion engine revolutionized life on the American farm, with manufacturers of agricultural machinery eagerly taking advantage of occasions like the Illinois State Fair to demonstrate their new products.\n\nThe Illinois State Fair was held almost every summer during this more than 150-year-long period. On a few occasions it was suspended. In 1893, for example, the organizers of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago prepared to offer a larger lineup of agricultural products and machinery, so the Illinois State Fair canceled itself for one year.\n\nThe Illinois State Fair, like many state fairs, moved during the first 40 years of its life, 1853–92, from place to place. It was celebrated as far north as Freeport and as far south as Du Quoin. In 1894, the State of Illinois began to use a parcel of land on the northern boundary of Springfield, which became the heart of the permanent Illinois State Fairgrounds. A grandstand and racetrack were built, and the first auto races were held at the Illinois State Fairgrounds Racetrack in 1910. The fairground site was expanded to its current dimensions in 1924.\n\nDuring 1895, the Dome Building was constructed on the grounds. The building's huge glass dome, the world's second largest unsupported dome at 222 feet in diameter, had been part of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. It was purchased for $69,000, taken down in Chicago and reassembled at the state fairgrounds. The building could accommodate 10,000 people and housed horticultural displays and National Guard offices. In 1917, about 1,500 soldiers waiting to go to war were temporarily housed in the Dome Building. On August 17, the building caught fire. Within 30 minutes after the fire was discovered, the huge glass dome came crashing down. At the time of the fire the building was valued at $300,000, but insured for only $20,000, and as a result, the remains of the building were later demolished. Apparently the soldiers were not to blame for the fire nor were any injured by it.\nThere was no state fair during the period 1942-1945 because the fairgrounds were used as a U.S. Army Air Force supply depot. According to one historian, in the fall of 1943 more than 1,000 Chinese military personnel were trained on the grounds.\n\nStarting with the end of World War II, the growth of productivity in agriculture began to reduce the number of jobs in American farming, both as a percentage of total population and in absolute numbers. State fairs began to transition themselves from agricultural trade shows to entertainment operations.\n\nIn Illinois, the State Fair Grandstand, originally built as a place to watch harness racing (and still used for that purpose as of 2015) became a venue for concerts and recitals. The \"state fair circuit\" became a recognized part of the overall live-music industry for many performers, especially but not exclusively in country music. Noted concerts held at The Grandstand include The Who, performing as an opening act for The Association in 1968.\n\nAgricultural show operations, competitions, and judging continued in Springfield, but many State Fairgoers in 2015 were attending the fair to watch parades and spectacles, enjoy the festival rides, listen to music, or drink beer in one of numerous \"beer tents.\"\n\nThe Illinois State Fairgrounds now contains more than 100 permanent buildings. In addition, participants set up countless pavilions and trailers during the period the State Fair is in operation. The Illinois State Fair is operated by the Illinois Department of Agriculture, which states in the state's official \"Illinois Blue Book\" that the purpose of the State Fair is to \"showcase Illinois agriculture and offer wholesome family entertainment.\" \n\nThe Illinois State Fairgrounds are also used as a venue for other competitive and entertainment operations throughout the year, such as motorcycle and car racing, horse shows, and rodeos.\n\nReported attendance at the Illinois State Fair was approximately 650,000 in 2003, 671,333 in 2004, 672,615 in 2005, approximately 705,000 in 2006, 737,052 in 2008, 918,435 in 2012, and 961,142 in 2013. After a change in attendance count methodology, reported State Fair attendance dropped sharply.

It includes songs with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Craig Carnelia. This was Ephron's first stage play.\n\nWriters Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy reunite in hell and reflect on their decades-long antagonistic relationship. Dating back to their first meeting at a conference at Sarah Lawrence College in 1948, it came to a head in 1980 when McCarthy, in a television interview with Dick Cavett, asserted, \"every word she writes is a lie, including 'and' and 'the'\". Hellman subsequently sued McCarthy for slander. As the play progresses, the two women recall, among other things, Hellman's 1952 testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee; McCarthy's childhood abuse by an uncle; and their romantic involvements: McCarthy with Philip Rahv and Hellman with Dashiell Hammett. Throughout it all, McCarthy accuses Hellman of repeatedly presenting fiction as fact, while Hellman insists McCarthy always portrays fact as fiction.\n\nDirected by Jack O'Brien, choreographed by Jerry Mitchell, and starring Cherry Jones as McCarthy, Swoosie Kurtz as Hellman, and Harry Groener as all the men in their lives, the play had its world premiere at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, where it ran from September 21 through November 3, 2002.\n\nThe production transferred to Broadway, opening at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 12, 2002. It closed on February 16, 2003 after 76 performances and 20 previews.\n\nIn his \"CurtainUp\" review of the San Diego production, Gordon Osmond called it \"an uncomfortable cross between vaudeville and conventional musical comedy.\" He observed, \"From its outset Act II shows that the production has been hijacked by Mr. Hamlisch and select members of his troupe of gypsies. The plays breaks out into a rash of stand-alone and largely incongruous musical numbers, which seem concocted for the sole purpose of filling up a record album designed perhaps to defray the production's undoubtedly daunting costs . . . [W]e have a desiccated trial scene which didn't happen in life and shouldn't, in its present form, have happened on stage. The finale consists of an off-stage cat fight between the stuffed doll alter egos of Hellman and McCarthy. Having two women of wit, wisdom and letters slug it out physically, albeit offstage, is not just imaginary, it's artistically misguided, pandering to that segment of the audience which doesn't for a moment understand the substance and potential of the play.\" He concluded, \"\"Imaginary Friends\" has the feel of a work by a new playwright who was recently quoted as saying that she 'got a taste of the freedom that theater offered . . .' What the playwright failed to recognize is that the theatre has its own rules; e.g., thematic and stylistic consistency.\" \n\nIn his review of the Broadway production, Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" said it \"isn't a show that leaves you gasping at its daring or chuckling over its cleverness. In chronicling a feud between two politically engaged, exceptionally feisty women within a literary world of men, Ms. Ephron makes her points dutifully, clearly and repetitively . . . In trying to appeal to both those who are and those who are not familiar with the play's high-brow heroines, the show winds up sacrificing its dramatic energy to Cliff Notes-like expositions disguised in masquerade costumes . . . Mr. Hamlisch's songs, with lyrics by Craig Carnelia, are tuneful, jinglelike numbers that add little in period flavor or character definition. And some of them simply slow things down to no purpose.\" \n\nReviewing for \"Talkin' Broadway\", Matthew Murray noted Nora Ephron \"has a thrillingly theatrical concept that she simply hasn't taken to its furthest extremes. This being her first play, that is perhaps understandable, and \"Imaginary Friends\" is never incompetent or boring. It does manage to be exciting occasionally, but less often than it should be . . . What Ephron gets right is her depiction of Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy as avatars for the diametrically opposed (maybe) deities of 'fiction' and 'fact.' . . . When \"Imaginary Friends\" tackles that aspect of the story, presenting its scenes with the flair and creativity only theatre can allow, the play is at its best . . . These moments . . . are theatrically astute and emotionally honest . . . Scenes that give us greater insight into the characters are always the most successful and entertaining.\" He called the songs \"the most puzzling component\" of the play, commenting, \"While the songs don't slow down or detract from the action, they do not particularly enhance it.\" He concluded, \"What is missing, and would probably have made the show more effective, is the literary music created by McCarthy and Hellman. For the most part, their writings - as lyrical and incisive as one is apt to find - are missing from the play, and the contributions of Hamlisch and Carnelia are a poor substitute. Late in the show, when we're reminded of the real legacy these women leave behind in the impressive volume of material each produced, it becomes all too obvious that \"Imaginary Friends\" is weaker for its absence. Given what is present, Nora Ephron could have quite a theatre career ahead of her . . . However, she would be expected to correct her lapses in judgment here in the future; if the addition of the songs was her idea, she should think twice next time and let her characters sing all on their own.\" \n\nCraig Carnelia was nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Lyrics but lost to Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman for \"Hairspray\". The play was also chosen as one of the ten best plays of the 2002-03 New York theatre season by \"The Best Plays Theatre Yearbook\", where critic Charles Wright wrote “Ephron’s characterization captures the tension of women defying expectations when literature was a men’s club and entry appeared—at times—to depend less on talent than on personal association with a man of established position. . . . At a time when deceptive rhetoric permeated the American ether, Ephron offered a play about prevarication and truth-telling in public discourse—and delivered a message of skepticism about the objectivity of “truth” and the credibility of those with easiest access to the media.” \n"}

The penalty that the Germans imposed on any Pole found to be harboring or otherwise aiding Jews was death.\n\nOne day Gut's employer discovered that she was concealing Jews in his house. Gut begged him to spare them; he agreed to, and never betrayed them or her. Gut became the German officer's mistress.

He achieved fame as a member of the military commission trying the conspirators involved with the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nEkin was born August 31, 1819 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to James and Susan Burling (Bayard) Ekin. His mother was a daughter of Colonel Stephen A. Bayard of the Continental Army. He served an apprenticeship as a steamboat builder, which eventually led to his first career as a steamboat builder in Pittsburgh.\n\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War, Ekin enlisted April 25, 1861 in the 12th Pennsylvania Infantry (a 3-month regiment) as a lieutenant and was assigned regimental quartermaster. Ekin mustered out with the regiment on August 5, 1861 at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

In addition to his volunteer ranks, Ekin was made a captain in the regular army March 13, 1863, lieutenant colonel and deputy quartermaster general July 29, 1865.\n\nDespite his excellent service in the Army quartermaster department, Ekin is remembered largely for his participation as a member of the military tribunal that heard the case against eight conspirators in the assassination of President Lincoln.\n\nEkin remained in the U.S. Army following the Civil War with the rank of lieutenant colonel and deputy quartermaster general until February 13, 1882 when he was promoted to colonel.

In an effort to gauge his audience's reaction, he said that force should be applied to ensure that all Muslims in America wear \"identifying markers. ...I'm thinking either it should be an arm band, a crescent moon arm band, or it should be a crescent moon tattoo. ...If it means that we have to round them up and do a tattoo in a place where everybody knows where to find it, then that's what we'll have to do.\"\n\nThe response was overwhelming and \"the phone lines jammed instantly\". Klein later stated that \"The switchboard went from empty to totally jammed within minutes.

Carter\n\nJoseph Oliver Carter (December 20, 1835 – February 27, 1909), known professionally as Joseph O. Carter, was also known as J. O. Carter and Joe Carter. He was a life-long friend, confidant, and legal advisor to Queen Liliʻuokalani, serving on her Privy Council of State. During the reign of King Kalākaua, Carter was Acting Commercial Agent for Japan, and served two terms as representative in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii. He was president of C. Brewer & Co. in Honolulu. Although he served in the Provisional Government of Hawaii after the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii, he was an opponent to annexation by the United States. Carter was trustee of many large estates in Hawaii, and was one of the first directors of the Bishop Museum. Hawaii diplomat Henry A. P. Carter was his brother, and Territorial Governor of Hawaii George R. Carter was his nephew.\n\nHe was born December 20, 1835, in a grass house in Honolulu, the first of six children of Massachusetts sea captain Joseph Oliver Carter (1802–1850) and his wife Hannah Trufant Lord (1809–1898). Captain Carter was a trader of Chinese commodities to Hawaii and California, and was the first-generation Carter family immigrant in the Kingdom of Hawaii. Hannah Trufant Lord of Hallowell, Maine immigrated to Hawaii in 1832 and married Capt. Carter in 1833, spending the first few years of their married life accompanying him on his voyages.\n\nAccording to Territorial Governor of Hawaii George R. Carter, son of Joseph's brother Henry A. P. Carter (1837–1891), no one in the family was named Joseph Oliver Carter Sr., and the only Jr. was a grandson of the sea captain. Sons Henry and Samuel Morrill Carter (1838–1893) were also born in Honolulu. Son Alfred Wellington Carter (1840–1890) was born aboard the ship Caliope off the coast of Tahiti. Their two youngest children Frederick William Carter (1842–1860), and Catherine Rebecca Carter Lewers (1844–1924) were born in Honolulu.\n\nGovernor Carter recalled being told by his uncle Joseph that after his birth in Honolulu, he and his mother Hannah accompanied Capt. Carter on a trip to Hong Kong where the young Joseph was baptized by a British sea captain. On November 28, 1859, he wed Mary Ladd, daughter of William Ladd who formed the sugar cane partnership Ladd & Co.. Mrs. Carter was a lady-in-waiting to Liliʻuokalani. The couple had six children.\n\nOne of Carter's earliest jobs was as a journalist with the \"Pacific Commercial Advertiser\". He was secretary of the local fire department, and then elected as \"Delegate to the Fire Department\". \n\nCarter was collector of special tax for roads and bridges, and eventually set up his own office as a tax collector. Shortly before the election of King Kalākaua, Carter began to rise in the political arena. He served two terms with the House of Representatives in the Legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii, for sessions April 30 – July 29, 1872 and January 8 – 20, 1873. During the 1874 Honolulu Courthouse riot provoked by the Legislative Assembly electing Kalākaua over Queen Emma, former representative Carter sustained injuries when he became a target of mob harassment and violence while helping to rescue legislators. When he refused to leave the scene, the rioters carried him off. He was subsequently appointed as Commercial Agent for Japan on September 1880, succeeding J. D. Brewer, and served until the establishment of the Japanese Consulate in 1885 and appointment of Jiro Nakamura. Carter also served as registrar for public accounts. He began at C. Brewer & Co. in 1880 as treasurer and secretary, and worked his way up to being elected president and manager of the company.\n\nHe managed Liliʻuokalani's personal real estate holdings and had been her friend and confidant for years before she ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891. When Liliʻuokalani became regent, Carter was appointed royal adviser on the Privy Council of State. At a June 23, 1892 ceremony at Iolani Palace when Japanese Consul-General Taigo Masaki bestowed Liliuokalani with the Grand Cross of the Imperial Japanese Order of the Crown, Carter was bestowed with Third Class Order of the Sacred Treasurer.\n\nLiliʻuokalani's proposed 1893 Constitution provoked protests, but Carter advised against her cabinet's suggestion of requesting American intervention to maintain civil order. He prepared a proclamation signed by the Queen and her cabinet that promulgation of a new constitution had been abandoned, but it was not enough to stave off the overthrow and installation of a provisional local government. Carter counseled her to resign under protest, and on January 17 she temporarily ceded her power to the United States. Following the overthrow, Carter was part of a group sent to Washington D. C. by the provisional government to plead its case for annexation. He was appointed by provisional president Sanford B. Dole to the Board of Health.\n\nPresident Grover Cleveland attempted a restoration of the monarchy, with the stipulation that Liliʻuokalani grant amnesty to everyone responsible. Over her demands of beheadings for all involved, Carter obtained her written assent to amnesty. Dole refused to re-instate the Queen, and the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894. \n\nCarter's standing in the business community suffered from his association with the Queen. According to Boston author Julius A. Palmer Jr., Carter's loyalty to her resulted in his being voted out of his position at C. Brewer & Co. The Queen was put on trial and under house arrest for her alleged part in the 1895 Robert Wilcox rebellion attempt to restore her to the throne. She was granted a full pardon in October 1896. When she left Hawaii for the United States in December, seeing her off at Honolulu Harbor were Carter, on whose arm she leaned as she walked up the gangplank, Robert Wilcox, and her former Minister of Foreign Affairs Samuel Parker.\n\nAt an October 1897 gathering of 2,000 anti-annexationists, Carter was the main speaker. He traveled to Washington D. C. in January 1898 to lobby against annexation. Newspaper coverage alleged he made the trip at the request of sugar plantation owner Claus Spreckels. When Hawaii was annexed in 1898, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. Liliʻuokalani spent the next several years unsuccessfully lobbying the government for return of the Crown Lands, during which she relied on Carter for legal consultation.\n\nToward the end of his life, Carter was handling all Liliʻuokalani's financial affairs. Carter was trustee and/or executor of the estates of several members of the Hawaiian nobility, including King Lunalilo. Most notably, the trusteeship that occupied much of Carter's final years was the Bernice P. Bishop estate. In addition to being one of the estate's trustees, he was one of the early directors of the Bishop Museum. Native Hawaiian politician John Adams Cummins, son of High Chiefess Kaumakaokane Papaliʻaiʻaina, made Carter trustee of his estate. He was one of the executors of the estate of James Campbell, husband of Abigail Kuaihelani Campbell who was a descendant of the Kalanikini line of Maui chieftains. At the time of his death, Campbell was one of the largest landholders in the Territory of Hawaii and left an estate estimated at $3,000,000.\n\nHe was designated as trustee and/or estate manager of numerous non-nobility trusts, including that of his brother Henry A. P. Carter, and as a trustee of Central Union Church. Samuel C. Allen, Kauai businessman, developer and financial backer of Port Allen, Hawaii, left an estate in excess of $2,000,000 in 1903, naming Carter as one of his executors.\n\nMary Carter died December 15, 1908 after an extended illness. Her obituary noted her close friendship with Liliʻuokalani. Joseph O. Carter died of pulmonary edema on February 27, 1909. His sister Catherine Rebecca Carter Lewers was his only surviving sibling. The Carters were survived by their children Joseph Jr., Henry, Charlotte, Mary, Rachel and Sara.\n\n"}

Text on the upper surface reads: \"Fraternitatis Lumen\".\n\nAfter World War II, Italian war widows began a movement to reconcile nations that had participated in the war, on both sides. In 1950, they organized a visit of families of those who had died in the war to several sites, including the Monte Cassino Abbey, where the original Lamp of Brotherhood was placed.\n\nThis initiative grew and by the late 1950s it had become the World Organization of the Lamp of Brotherhood (\"Opera Mondiale della Lampada della Fraternità\"), a subsidiary of the Pontificia Commissione di Assistenza led by Bishop Ferdinando Baldelli. A ceremony was held in the partially re-built Monte Cassino in 1956, in which Lamps were given to representatives of many nations. Each country that received a Lamp was intended to create a national \"Lampada\" organization, which was to have custody of the Lamp.\n\nThe Vancouver Lamp arrived in Vancouver through the participation of Air Vice Marshal Ken Guthrie in the original Lamp service in 1956. Guthrie said that he and his wife were the only representatives from North America at this Lamp-giving ceremony and it was placed in their custody.\n\nNo \"Lampada\" organization was started in North America, and so the Lamp remained in the custody of Ken and Kay Guthrie.

The commission was mandated to investigate the facts and circumstances which led to the failure of the ceasefire agreement made operational on 27 February 2002, the lessons that should be learnt from those events and the institutional, administrative and legislative measures which need to be taken in order to prevent any recurrence of such concerns in the future, and to promote further national unity and reconciliation among all communities. After an 18-month inquiry, the commission submitted its report to the President on 15 November 2011. The report was made public on 16 December 2011, after being tabled in the parliament.\n\nThe commission concluded that the Sri Lankan military didn't deliberately target civilians but the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) repeatedly violated international humanitarian law. According to the commission the military gave the \"highest priority\" to protecting civilians whereas the Tamil Tigers had had \"no respect for human life\". The commission admitted that civilians had been killed by the Sri Lankan military, albeit accidentally, contradicting the government's line that there were zero civilian casualties. The commission did, however, receive some eyewitness evidence alleging abuse by the military which warranted further investigation and, if necessary, the prosecution of perpetrators. The commission acknowledged that hospitals had been shelled, resulting \"considerable civilian casualties\", but it did not say who was responsible for the shelling. The commission blamed Sinhalese and Tamil politicians for causing the civil war: the Sinhalese politicians failed to offer a solution acceptable to the Tamil people and the Tamil politicians fanned militant separatism.\n\nThe commission has been heavily criticised by international human rights groups, the UN Panel of Experts and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses. These critics believed that the Sri Lankan government was using the commission as a tool to prevent an independent international investigation of alleged abuses. As a consequence of this Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group refused to appear before the commission.\n\nTensions between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities in Sri Lanka turned into a full-scale war between the Sri Lankan government and LTTE in 1983. In 2002, government and the LTTE signed a Norwegian-mediated ceasefire. Both LTTE and the government resumed fighting in 2006, and the government officially backed out of the ceasefire in 2008. After a violent last few months, in May 2009, the government killed LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and declared an end to the civil war. Following the end of the war, international pressure mounted on the government to inquire into the final stages of the civil war, in which it was alleged thousands of civilians, possibly as many as 40,000, were killed. Over the course of the entire war, between 60,000 and 100,000 deaths. There were calls to look into the root causes of the civil war and meaningful reconciliation. The Sri Lankan government rejected calls for an independent \"international\" inquiry but instead on 15 May 2010, nearly a year after the end of the civil war, President Rajapaksa appointed the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission to look back at the conflict Sri Lanka suffered for 26 years. Its secretariat was established at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute of International Relations and Strategic Studies in Colombo. Hearings of the commission, which commenced on 11 August 2010, were public and open to media, unless the witness requested otherwise. The LLRC issued some interim recommendations on 13 September 2010. Time limit to produce the final report was extended twice, until 15 November 2011. Hearings were held in Colombo and in former conflict affected areas such as Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar and Vavuniya. Field visits were conducted to the former war zone and detention centres where surrendered Tamil Tiger combatants were held. After analysing over 1,000 oral and 5,000 written submissions it had received, the commission presented its 388-page final report to the President on 15 November 2011. It was made public on 16 December 2011.\n\nThe mandate of the LLRC was as follows:<ref name=\"1658/19\"></ref>\n\n\"To inquire and report on the following matters that may have taken place during the period between 21 February 2002 and 19 May 2009, namely:\n\nThe LLRC's eight members were:\n\nThe commission's secretary was S. B. Atugoda, a former Sri Lankan ambassador to Qatar.\n\nIn September 2010 the LLRC published its interim recommendations: \n\nThe report provides a detailed analysis of the oral and written representations made to the commission. The 1st chapter gives an introduction to the report and the methodology the commission has used. 2nd chapter is devoted to the 2002 Ceasefire Agreement (CFA). There the commission analyses its background, political and security dimensions and the impact. The commission also tries to evaluate the CFA's effectiveness and the causes which led to its eventual collapse. The next chapter provides an insight into the security forces operations in Eastern and Wanni theaters, with a note about the casualty figures of both security forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Chapter 4 deals with the Humanitarian law issues pertaining to the conflict. This includes hundreds of eyewitness reports and clarifications of the incidents brought to light. There is also an evaluation of the Sri Lanka experience in the context of allegations of violations of International humanitarian law (IHL). Here, the commission concludes that security forces had not deliberately targeted civilians during the final stages of war, but civilian casualties had occurred under unavoidable circumstances. The commission also casts doubts about the authenticity of Channel 4 videos.\n\nChapter 5 deals with the human rights issues arising from the conflict. It analyses the alleged \"white van\" abductions, unlawful arrests, arbitrary detention and involuntary disappearances. This chapter goes into details of the instances where such incidents have occurred, and places the blame on certain paramilitary groups who allegedly hold the responsibility. Next 2 chapters are devoted to land issues regarding the returning Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and restitution/compensatory relief paid out to persons who are affected by the conflict. Chapter 8 talks about the post war reconciliation and alleviating the grievances of affected groups, especially the Sri Lankan Tamil people, in broad terms. The ninth and the final chapter summarizes the principle observations and recommendations made by the commission.\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2010 the government established the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee headed by the then attorney general Mohan Peiris to implement the LLRC's interim recommendations. However, the recommendations remain largely unimplemented. The LLRC's final report admits that there had been no progress in the implementation of its interim recommendations.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, the Sri Lankan government released a statement on the formulation of an action plan to implement the recommendations of LLRC.\n\nAccording to a study by the Colombo-based think tank Verité Research, only 20 percent of the commission’s 189 actionable recommendations have been implemented, with 57% of the cases being described as \"partial implementation\" and 22% of the cases being described as \"poor\" in progress.\n\nThe LLRC has been criticized by international human rights groups, the UN Panel of Experts and others due its limited mandate, alleged lack of independence and its failure to meet minimum international standards or offer protection to witnesses. These critics argued that the commission was primarily set up to examine the failure of the 2002 ceasefire and had no explicit mandate to examine the alleged war crimes committed by both sides during the final months of the civil war. But the Sri Lankan government rejected the UN's war report calling it \"fundamentally flawed\" and \"patently biased\". According to criticism, previous commissions of inquiry established by the Sri Lankan government had failed to achieve anything other than delaying criminal investigations and had been plagued by government interference.\n\nAmnesty International has condemned the commission as \"fundamentally flawed\" and unable to provide accountability for alleged atrocities. Amnesty claimed that the LLRC was a ploy by the Sri Lankan government to prevent an independent international investigation and that it would never deliver justice, truth and full reparations for the war victims. Human Rights Watch (HRW) claimed that the commission was an inadequate response to the many serious allegations of wartime abuses; explaining that it lacked independence and a proper mandate; its members weren't impartial or competent; it failed to provide adequate and effective protection for witnesses; it didn't have adequate resources; and that the government wouldn't give serious consideration to the commission's recommendations. The International Crisis Group (ICG) claimed that the flawed LLRC would neither provide accountability nor reconciliation. As a consequence of the above concerns Amnesty, HRW and ICG announced in October 2010 that they had declined to appear before the \"fundamentally flawed\" commission.\n\nThe independence of the commission has been questioned due to the fact its members were appointed by the Sri Lankan government, one of the parties accused of committing war crimes. Most of its members were retired senior government employees. Some even held senior government positions during the final stages of the war when they publicly defended the conduct of the government and military against allegations of war crimes. H. M. G. S. Palihakkara, who was Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, represented the government and defended the actions of the Sri Lankan military during the final months of the civil war. A. Rohan Perera was legal advisor to the Foreign Ministry during the period investigated by the LLRC. The chair C. R. De Silva was Attorney-General from April 2007 to December 2008 and as such was the most senior law officer with responsibility for many of the issues brought before the LLRC. Silva was accused of interfering in a previous commission, the \"2006-2009 Presidential Commission of Inquiry\" into allegations of serious human rights violations by the security forces. The International Independent Group of Eminent Persons, who had been invited by the President to oversee the Commission’s work, resigned in April 2008 citing De Silva's behaviour as one of major reasons for doing so.\n\nThe commission was seen as a tool to discredit the opposition United National Party whose leader Ranil Wickramasinghe was Prime Minister when the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE was signed in 2002. The BBC was banned from covering the proceeding.\n\nThe report was generally received well within Sri Lanka, although some aspects of the report were criticized by various political groups and figures.\n\nThe Tamil National Alliance (TNA), the largest political party representing the Sri Lankan Tamils, criticised the report for categorically failing to \"effectively and meaningfully deal with issues of accountability\" and called its findings an offence against the dignity of the war victims. The TNA has called on the international community to establish a \"mechanism for accountability\" in order to bring to book the perpetrators of war crimes. In an interview with The Sunday Leader TNA leader R. Sampanthan expressed his disappointment of the report stating: \"on the particular issue of accountability with regard to violation of international humanitarian laws and international human rights laws by the Sri Lankan Government.\" He also said that the report has not done justice for the many thousands of victims of the war. According to TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran the LLRC had contradicted itself by maintaining that it had no mandate to investigate into any incident and yet clearing of the armed forces of deliberately targeting civilians. “How can the LLRC come to such a conclusion without investigating into the matter”, Sumanthiran queried. The TNA subsequently issued a 115-page analytical response to the LLRC report in which it concluded that the LLRC had \"failed to fulfill the expectations of the Tamil community\" and that it did \"not address important questions of accountability; was designed to shield civilian and military leaders responsible for serious crimes from blame; and evinces the Sri Lankan State’s unwillingness to acknowledge and address issues of accountability\". The report went on to urge the international community to acknowledge that the domestic accountability mechanisms had consistently failed and to \"take steps to establish an international mechanism for accountability\".\n\nJathika Hela Urumaya, a Sinhalise national group, claimed that LLRC had over passed their mandate and had failed to look into the 9,878 civil assassinations carried out by the LTTE.\n\nDr. Dayan Jayatilleka, former Sri Lankan ambassador to France, commenting on the report stated \"Though not without flaws and lacuna, LLRC report does not disappoint, and reaches high standards, ranking with the best reports emanating over the decades from official and semi-official/autonomous Sri Lankan commissions, reviews and probes. It is a serious, thoughtful, carefully written and constructed text, striking in its fair-mindedness and balance. It deserves constructive engagement with, by all concerned Sri Lankan citizens and those in the world community who are concerned about and with Sri Lanka.\" He pointed out two factual inaccuracies in the report. The first one being that the 2002 CFA was the result and in the context of the military weakness of the Sri Lankan state. He explained, this had in fact not been the case as at that time, LRRP missions were taking down the Tiger command structure and followed and not preceded the disastrous Agni Kheela operation and the devastating Bandaranaike Airport attack. Second one is that LLRC Report draws a veil of silence over the lopsided post-tsunami relief mechanism (PTOMS) which was negotiated at the tail end of the presidency of Chandrika Kumaratunga.\n\nEditorial of \"The Island\" — the Sri Lankan English language daily — named \"LLRC shows the way\" (19 December 2011) compared the LLRC report with the Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka saying, \"Unlike the UN Secretary General's advisory panel which took cover behind a wall of secrecy and hurriedly put together a report of sorts--which has been made out to be a UN document--based on mere unsubstantiated allegations and LTTE propaganda, the LLRC has ensured transparency in the process of inquiry and presented both sides of the story complete with its observations and recommendations.\"\n\nEditorial of \"The Sunday Times\" — the Sri Lankan English language daily — named \"Heed LLRC's call to save Rule of Law\" noted that while \"the commission was not something the Government had in mind in the flush of its military victory over the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009\", it \"quite correctly placed much of the blame for this polarization on politicians who were looking to bolster their vote base by whipping up the communal drum\". It also stated that \"This LLRC report is not to be taken lightly due to both international and domestic pressure for good governance. This report is in a completely different league.\"\n\n - Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd issued a statement on 13 February 2012 welcoming the report's recommendations but expressing concern that it failed \"to fully address alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law\". The statement noted that Australia had consistently called on Sri Lanka to \"investigate all allegations of crimes committed by both sides to the conflict, including those raised in the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts report\" but that the LLRC report had failed to \"comprehensively address such allegations\". As such the Australian government continues to call on Sri Lanka to investigate all such allegations \"in a transparent and independent manner\". The statement urged the Sri Lankan government to \"set clear, firm timeframes\" for the implementation of the report's recommendations.\n\nThe Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma issued a statement on 19 December 2011 welcoming the release of the report and the commitments given by the Sri Lankan government in respect the conclusions and recommendations.\n\nimplement the recommendations in the report is needed, including on the issue of accountability. We continue to encourage the Government of Sri Lanka to engage with the UN Secretary General and relevant UN bodies on these matters.\n\nIn February 2012 some Member of the European Parliament tried unsuccessfully to pass a resolution which welcomed the LLRC report and urged its rapid implementation. Instead the European Parliament passed resolution P7 TA-PROV(2012)0058 B7-0071/2012 in which it called for the \"establishment of a UN commission of inquiry into all crimes committed, as recommended by the UN Secretary General's Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka\".\n\nAt the 19th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council Navi Pillay, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, welcomed the report's publications and noted that it makes important recommendations. However, Pillay believed that the report fell \"short of the comprehensive accountability process recommended by the Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts\" and she went on the urge the UNHRC to discuss the report.\n\nFollowing the release of the report, Amnesty International noted that the LLRC report \"acknowledges serious human rights problems in Sri Lanka but falls short of fully addressing the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the final phases of the conflict\". According to Amnesty the report ignores the \"serious evidence of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of the laws of war by government forces\". Amnesty urged the Sri Lankan authorities to take the report's recommendations seriously but concluded that, based on previous experience, \"effective investigation and prosecution of all wrongdoers...is very unlikely without the active support of the international community\".\n\nHuman Rights Watch has condemned the LLRC report for disregarding the worst abuses by government forces, rehashing long-standing recommendations and failing to advance accountability for victims of Sri Lanka’s civil armed conflict. HRW has stated that the \"serious shortcomings\" of the report highlighted \"the need for an international investigative mechanism into the conflict as recommended by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Panel of Experts\".\n\nThe International Crisis Group welcomed the public release of the LLRC report but noted that it failed in a crucial task - \"providing the thorough and independent investigation of alleged violations of international humanitarian and human rights law that the UN and other partners of Sri Lanka have been asking for\". The ICG urged the international community to establish an independent international investigation in 2012.\n\nIn an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\" the members of the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka (Marzuki Darusman, Steven R. Ratner and Yasmin Sooka) criticised the LLRC report for ignoring or playing down their report's conclusions and for characterising the civilian deaths as a consequence of the army’s response to Tamil Tiger shelling or cross-fire. They also criticised the report's recommendations that the army and the attorney general carry out further investigation as these organisations had ignored \"governmental abuses for decades\". Noting that the Sri Lankan government had failed to implement prior commissions recommendations and its \"unwillingness to take concrete steps\", they concluded that the only way for the truth to be exposed is for the United Nations Human Rights Council \"to create an independent investigative body to determine the facts and identify those responsible\".\n\nThe Global Tamil Forum (GTF), an umbrella group for Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora groups, has welcomed the report's publications, stating that its findings \"only serve to emphasise the importance of establishing an international, independent accountability mechanism to investigate whether Government forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) breached any international law, committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in the last months of the war\". The GTF acknowledged some the report's judgements and recommendations but noted that some of its conclusions on the prosecution of the conflict contradicted many of the findings of the UN Panel of Experts.\n\nEditor-in-Chief of The Hindu — the Indian English-language daily — N. Ram in his 22 December 2011 editorial stated that the report has established a key fact — that there were \"considerable\" civilian casualties in the final stages of the military operation to crush the LTTE. The editorial went into detail that \"Given the ethnic polarisation in Sri Lanka, these recommendations seem painfully insufficient. Even so, this is Sri Lanka's first attempt at introspection about the war. If the government is serious about reconciliation and learning lessons from the past, it must make a start by acting on the LLRC's recommendations.\"\n\nCommenting on the LLRC report, Col. R. Hariharan, a retired Military Intelligence officer of the Indian Army and a columnist of South Asia Analysis Group, said that \"LLRC report is constructive and covers almost all issues that relate to aberrations in governance, lack of transparency and the need to take speedy action on restoring confidence among Tamil minority.\" He also added \"The report provides badly needed breathing space for the government, as the Commission has done a fairly good job if one goes by the President’s mandate given to it. The well written report analyses in detail the reasons for past and present discontent of Tamils and has drawn the government attention to a number issues that had triggered Tamil insurgency.\" \nIn an opinion piece in \"The New York Times\" journalist Namini Wijedasa describes the report as \"largely an apologia for the army\" in respect of the events in the final stages of the civil war. According to Wijedasa, whilst the report makes sensible recommendations, exposes the grave atrocities committed by the LTTE and demonstrates that the government forces shelled the No Fire Zones, it only admits that civilians were killed by crossfire and blames the LTTE for most of the casualties. Wijedasa concludes that \"Sri Lankans no longer need to pretend that the army didn’t shell zones where civilians were encouraged to gather [by the army], or subscribe to the fantasy that no innocents died when shells landed on or near hospitals\".\n\nExpressing his support to the LLRC, Australian Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly Telmo Languiller said that LLRC report covers all relevant ground and sets the framework for practical reconciliation in Sri Lanka.\n\nNamini Wijedasa, a Sri Lankan journalist, called the report \"an apologia for the army\". Even in the final weeks when the government took violent measures to defeat the LTTE, the commission only admitted, \"civilian casualties had in fact occurred in the course of crossfire\".\n\nReport by Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission became the basis for the discussion on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Council 19th session in March 2012. The council adopted a resolution on promoting reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, urging the Sri Lankan government to implement constructive recommendations made in the LLRC report. The resolution welcomed the constructive recommendations contained in the report and noted with concern that the report did not adequately address serious allegations of violations of international law.\n\nTwo last-minute changes to the resolution, pressed by India, made it \"unobtrusive\" in nature and \"non-judgemental\" in approach. These amendments gave the government of Sri Lanka a veto over any future recommendations by the OHCHR. There was no reference to alleged war crimes or an international investigation, as called for by human rights groups.\n\n\n"}

It premiered in Munich on 7 May 1996. Described variously as an \"opera within an opera\" and a \"fantasia on an epic journey\", the multi-layered storyline is loosely based on the journey of Marco Polo from Venice to China. In the opera, Marco Polo becomes two characters: Marco, who represents the real person and is sung by a mezzo-soprano, and Polo who represents his memory and is sung by a tenor. The work is scored for vocal soloists, a chorus of 20 and a large orchestra of both modern and medieval European instruments as well as instruments from the cultures that Marco Polo passed through on his journey, including sitar, pipa, sheng, tabla and Tibetan horns and bells. \"Marco Polo\" won the 1998 Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition.\n\n\"Marco Polo\" began as a commission by the Edinburgh International Festival in the late 1980s. However, it was not completed until 1995 and received its first performance at the Munich Biennale on 7 May 1996 directed by Martha Clarke.

Nadal was encouraged to produce the play after his rival Voltaire's play on the same story had failed after only one performance the previous year (1724). However, at the play's February 1725 premiere at the Comédie-Française, the audience booed its opening scenes and demanded that Voltaire's play be put on instead.\n\nNadal was convinced his own \"Mariamne\" had failed because of Voltaire's \"brigue horrible et scandaleuse\" that set Paris against it, and said so in the preface to the printed play, accusing him of bringing a cabal into the audience at the premiere to disrupt it. This gave Voltaire the opportunity to reply under a pseudonym with withering compliments (\"Lettre de M. Thieriot à M. l'Abbé Nadal\", 1725), commiserating with Nadal, that it was solely the machinations of Voltaire's intrigues \"that one hears it said so scandalously that you are the worst versifier of the century and the most tiresome writer.\" Voltaire's fine-honed savagery inspired Nadal to excise the uncomplimentary remarks about Voltaire in his prefaces when he came to collect and publish the plays in 1736 with others of his poems, in three small volumes.

Overbilling in the legal industry can occur with both large institutional clients and smaller, individual companies or personal clients. Overbilling can be an issue in the consultancy and information technology industries as well. Stephen Northcutt, Cynthia Madden, and Cynthia Welti wrote that overbilling occurs more often within larger companies where there is less of a personal connection between employees or contractors and the firm being billed.\n\nOverbilling can occur when larger institutions or governments create errors in their calculations of how much various individuals may owe. Banks and credit card providers can also overbill clients, or indirectly facilitate overbilling through the method by which they allow vendors to charge a client after the client has accented to having their card billed. It has been argued that overbilling is rampant enough in some industries that employees that refuse to overbill risk their jobs due to a lack of economic foresight or acuity in management policies or business plans.\n\nOverbilling clients can constitute an example of breach of contract and result in fines, lawsuits, or prison time. Overbilling can also be a part of U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act schemes and other organized crime activities. Some individuals that have been convicted of overbilling were done so under the charge of mail fraud, or under the \"False Claims Act\" in the United States.\n\nLeonard Vona wrote that, \"Overbilling schemes differ from false billing schemes in that the vendor is a real vendor and actual goods or services are provided. The real vendor typically commits the scheme in collusion with a company employee. The real vendor over charges the company and an accounts payable manager approves the vendor invoice for payment. The vendor can commit the scheme without internal collusion by taking advantage of known internal control weaknesses.\" He also wrote that overbilling can occur via fictitious charges, inflated prices, inflating the quantity on a statement above the actual quantity delivery, providing sub-standard products, charging for goods or services a vendor knows a company does not need, charging too much, and others.\n\nOverbilling is a part of many fraud audit infrastructures employed by large companies. Computer programs and software is often used to screen a company's finances to check for overbilling or symptoms of overbilling. Overbilling has been the focus of several infamous scandals, such as the Worldcom scandal and the bankruptcy of W. T. Grant.\n"}

It was preceded by four days of vehicle exhibition and qualifying events that created great crowds and excitement. The eight qualifying events started near the Bois de Boulogne and comprised interwoven routes around Paris to select the entrants for the main event.\n\nThe first driver across the finishing line at Rouen was \"\"le Comte\" de Dion\" but he did not win the main prize because his steam vehicle needed a 'stoker' and was thus ineligible. The fastest petrol powered car was a Peugeot driven by Albert Lemaître. The premier prize, the 5,000 franc \"Prix du Petit Journal\", for 'the competitor whose car comes closest to the ideal' was shared equally by manufacturers Panhard et Levassor and Les fils de Peugeot frères (\"The sons of Peugeot brothers\"), with vehicles that were 'easy to use'.\n\nIn 1894, Pierre Giffard, editor of \"Le Petit Journal\", organised the world's first motoring competition from Paris to Rouen to publicise his newspaper, to stimulate interest in motoring and to develop French motor manufacturing. Sporting events were a tried and tested form of publicity stunt and circulation booster. The paper promoted it as \"Le Petit Journal Competition for Horseless Carriages\" (\"Le Petit Journal Concours des Voitures sans Chevaux\") that were \"not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey\", the main prize being for \"the competitor whose car comes closest to the ideal\". The \"easy to drive\" clause effectively precluded from the prizes any vehicles needing a travelling mechanic or technical assistant such as a stoker.\n\n\"Le Petit Journal\" announced prize money totalling 10,000 gold francs – 5,000 for first place, 2,000 for second, 1,500 for third; 1,000 for fourth, and 500 for fifth. The main prize was for the first eligible vehicle across the finish line in Rouen.\n\nOne-hundred and two people paid the 10 franc entrance fee. They ranged from practical manufacturers like Peugeot, Panhard, de Dion-Bouton, and Serpollet to amateur owners and 'over-ambitious concepts'. Seventy-eight entrants did not show up for qualifying on 18 July, these included some 25 powered by unfamiliar and improbable technologies such as \"gravity\" – nine; \"compressed air\" – five; \"automatic\" – three; electricity – three; gas – three; hydraulics – two; liquid, pedals, propellers, and levers. Additionally, 19 petrol-powered designs and 26 steam-powered cars, quadricycles, and tricycles did not show up at the qualifying event.\n\nQualifying was held from 19–21 July 1894, and was preceded by a public exhibition of 26 cars to Neuilly-sur-Seine on 18 July. Journalists reported great crowds and excitement throughout the routes, and at Précy-sur-Oise they finished through a triumphal arch. On 19 July, 26 cars lined the side of the Boulevard Maillot, stretching to the Bois de Boulogne, each parked apart until, at 8:00 am, the first car led off, followed at 15-second intervals by the others. The qualifying event had to be completed in under three hours to be eligible to start the main event, the race from Paris to Rouen; 21 were selected for the main event.\n\nQualifying was used as a major publicity tool for both the event and the newspaper \"for our readers who want to see the cars on the roads around Paris\". The 22 vehicles were split into five groups who completed complex interwoven tours of Paris and its environs, including Mantes-la-Jolie, Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Flins-sur-Seine, Poissy, Triel-sur-Seine, Rambouillet, Versailles, Dampierre-en-Yvelines, Corbeil-Essonnes, Palaiseau, Précy-sur-Oise, Gennevilliers and L'Isle-Adam, Val-d'Oise. The groups were carefully balanced to ensure each included petrol and steam, a Peugeot, a Panhard & Levassor, and different seating. \"Le Petit Journal\", on the morning of the event, still officially expected Lemoigne and his gravity-powered vehicle to participate, although he was included as an additional member of group five.\n\nThe groups that set off from Porte Maillot on Thursday 19 July were:\n\n\n\n\nOn Friday 20 July a second qualifying event was run over two routes.\n\nOn Saturday 21 July a third qualifying event was run from Paris to Poissy.\n\nAt 8:00 am on 22 July, twenty-one qualifiers started from Porte Maillot and went via the Bois de Boulogne, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Courbevoie, Nanterre, Chatou, Le Pecq, Poissy, Triel-sur-Seine, Vaux-sur-Seine, and Meulan, to Mantes where they stopped for lunch from 12:00 pm until 1:30 pm, whence they set off to Vernon, Eure, Gaillon, Pont-de-l'Arche, and 'Champ de Mars' at Rouen.\n\nCount de Dion was first into Rouen, after 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of .

Others have identified quasi-political motivations such as the effort to hinder the entry of corporations into Second Life, and yet others have identified their activities as nihilistic or even agonistic online branches of the political avant-garde. The DHRA has also described them as a prime example of online criminal gang culture including spillover effects into real life gang activity. The group has been linked to internet group Anonymous as both a sub-group and an early progenitor iteration. They have been described as /b/tards (a group affiliated with 4chan), members of SomethingAwful.com, and as an offspring of the W-Hats griefer group (itself an offshoot of the Goons). The PN make casual use of racist, sexist, and homophobic terminology which some researchers dismiss as a joke and which others have identified as \"problematic\" and \"troubling\".\n\nWhatever the true character and affiliations of the group, it has provoked commentary by critics and internet culture writers since its formation in 2005, and it has been listed as one of the central figures in the griefer culture of Second Life. Membership in the group has ranged from 35 members in 2007 up to a rough 200 at their peak in mid-2011.\n\nThe origin of the Patriotic Nigras has been traced by cyber-rights researcher Peter Ludlow to the /b/ imageboard of the website 4chan where board members decided in late 2005 to \"raid\" Habbo Hotel, a popular avatar-based social networking game. The raid took the form of numerous black men presenting avatars with outsize afros and Armani suits blocking access to the virtual pool and telling other users that \"the pool is closed because of AIDS.\" From this raid, according to Ludlow, emerged the Patriotic Nigras and their Internet meme slogan \"Pool's Closed.\"\n\nThe success of the first raid has led the Patriotic Nigras to perform raids on the Habbo Hotel during subsequent years. The 2006 anniversary raid was organized at the /i/ imageboard of the website 7chan. The format of these raids is always the same with the use of avatars that look like black men with afros, and with the group sometimes attempting to offend users by forming images with the avatars such as swastikas.\n\nThe Second Life phase of the group's activities began in early 2006 when an anonymous user known as \"Mudkips Acronym\" reposted on 4chan a question originally posed at eBaum's World regarding whether or not Second Life \"was raidable.\" There were 143 Patriotic Nigras members as of September 2007, of which around 35–60 were active. The response to \"Mudkips Acronym\"'s challenge was rapid and the group soon established itself as a fixture on Second Life. As of 2008, the Patriotic Nigras were said to operate hundreds, if not thousands, of Second Life accounts.\n\nBy mid-2006, a number of Second Life users had had enough of the PN's antics and a Second Life member named \"Kalel Venkman\" formed a counter-griefer vigilante group named the Justice League Unlimited. With avatars donning the skins of superheroes like Superman and Wonder Woman, the Justice League Unlimited established monitors in many areas of Second Life and zealously reported any untoward behavior to the Linden Lab administrators. The zeal with which they executed their duties, however, proved to be problematic and they were soon banned from areas such as FurNation for excessive vigilantism. According to cyber-rights researcher, Peter Ludlow, the Justice League Unlimited's anti-PN efforts also became problematic as the close association between 4chan users and Patriotic Nigras led to the unwarranted harassment of many users who were 4channers only and not members of the PN.\n\nIn February 2007, the group gained media coverage after an attack on the Second Life headquarters of politician John Edwards in which the Patriotic Nigras attacked with their avatars bearing \"Bush 08\" buttons and defaced Edwards's structure with feces, Marxist/Leninist posters, and obscenity. They also received coverage for an earlier attack on a room where Second Life user Anshe Chung was being interviewed about her claims to have made the 'virtual property' equivalent of over one million dollars off the game. The room was invaded by flying penises. This incident was also attributed to the \"Room 101\" group.\nThe Patriotic Nigras were at first tolerated by the producers of Second Life, Linden Lab, but after the John Edwards attack they began to crack down and now take efforts to find and ban griefers on sight. To fight back, the Patriotic Nigras found ways to bypass the bans Linden Lab typically employs. New Media critics have described the Patriotic Nigras' antagonistic relationship with Linden Lab as arising in reaction to the company's player-monitoring policies (described as part of a broadly Foucaultian institutionalized control apparatus). To further their aims on Second Life, the PN developed a modified Second Life client called ShoopedLife that allowed them to bypass many of the hardware-banning methods typically used by Linden Lab to prevent persistent griefers from accessing Second Life. Reacting against this, the Justice League Unlimited formed close associations with Linden Lab administrators, going so far as to monitor when administrators were available for contact so that griefing could be rapidly halted.\n\nAs Patriotic Nigras countermeasures intensified the situation, Justice League Unlimited suspicions concerning Patriotic Nigras connections to 4chan deepened and Second Life players received bans for nothing more than their association with 4chan. This finally culminated in the closing of Woodbury University's virtual campus, and led thereafter to an escalation of factional maneuvers between the Woodbury group and the Justice League Unlimited who characterized all opponents as PN sympathizers. In a series of multi-directional infiltrations, personal information including the real life names of \"Kalel Venkman,\" several Woodbury group members, writers for The Alphaville Herald, and Patriotic Nigras leader \"Mudkips Acronym\" was published online. In August 2007, \"Mudkips Acronym\" resigned in fear that this information would be used to compromise his security, and by mid-2008, the Justice League Unlimited had been disbanded following embarrassing revelations of the nature of their relationship with Linden Lab and their efforts to \"dox\" Second Lifers suspected of connections to the PNs through the collection of extensive dossier-style information.\n\nFollowing the exit of \"Mudkips Acronym,\" members of the Patriotic Nigras held an election to determine the new leader, which was won by a user known online as \"^ban^\". According to a griefing publication, \"^ban^\" resigned after ten months and handed control of the group over to a user known by the screen name \"FrizzleFry101\". In July 2008, the PN client, ShoopedLife was further modified to utilize the Lua code base to automate specific functions of the regular client. In December 2008, the main developer for ShoopedLife, \"N3X15,\" left the Patriotic Nigras, effectively ending development of the client.\n\n"}
{"id": "202304", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=202304", "title": "Protests against the Iraq War", "text": "Protests against the Iraq War\n\nBeginning in 2002, and continuing after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, large-scale protests against the Iraq War were held in many cities worldwide, often coordinated to occur simultaneously around the world. After the biggest series of demonstrations, on February 15, 2003, \"New York Times\" writer Patrick Tyler claimed that they showed that there were two superpowers on the planet: the United States and worldwide public opinion.\n\nThese demonstrations against the war were mainly organized by anti-war organizations, many of whom had been formed in opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. In some Arab countries demonstrations were organized by the state. Europe saw the biggest mobilization of protesters, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally.\n\nAccording to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between January 3 and April 12, 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.\n\nIn the United States, even though pro-war demonstrators have been quoted as referring to anti-war protests as a \"vocal minority\", Gallup Polls updated September 14, 2007 state, \"Since the summer of 2005, opponents of the war have tended to outnumber supporters. A majority of Americans believe the war was a mistake.\"\n\nA March 2003 Gallup poll conducted during the first few days of the war showed that 5% of the population had protested or made a public opposition against the war compared to 21% who attended a rally or made a public display to support the war. An ABC news poll showed that 2% had attended an anti-war protest and 1% attended a pro-war rally. The protests made 20% more opposed to the war and 7% more supportive. A Fox News poll showed that 63% had an unfavorable view of the protesters, just 23% had a favorable view. According to Pew Research, 40% said in March 2003 that they had heard \"too much\" from people opposed to the war against 17% who said \"too little\".\n\nSome observers have noted that the protests against the Iraq War have been relatively small-scale and infrequent compared to protests against the Vietnam War. One of the most often cited factors for this is the lack of conscription.\n\nThese protests are said to be the biggest global peace protests before a war actually started; the peace movement is compared with the movement caused by the Vietnam War.\n\nOn September 12, 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. Outside the United Nations building, over 1,000 people attended a protest organized by Voter March and No Blood for Oil.\n\nOn September 24, Tony Blair released a document describing Britain's case for war in Iraq. Three days later, an anti-war rally in London drew a crowd of at least 150,000.\n\nOn September 29, roughly 5,000 anti-war protesters converged on Washington, D.C. on the day after an anti-International Monetary Fund protest.\n\nOn October 2, the day President Bush signed into law Congress' joint resolution authorizing the war, a small-scale protest was held in Chicago, attended by a crowd of roughly 1,000 who listened to speeches by Jesse Jackson and then-Illinois State Senator Barack Obama. Obama's statement, \"I am not opposed to all wars. I'm opposed to dumb wars,\" was barely noted at the time, but became famous during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries when the Obama camp used it to demonstrate his courage and good judgment on the war.\n\nOn October 7, Bush delivered a major speech justifying the invasion of Iraq at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. Outside, approximately 3000 people gathered to protest the coming war. Later, a few hundred protesters blocking the Museum Center exits were dispersed by mounted police, and six people were arrested.\n\nOn October 26, protests took place in various cities across the world. Over 100,000 people took part in a protest in Washington. 50,000 people took part in a demonstration in San Francisco. Both protests were called by the ANSWER Coalition.\n\nOn October 31, around 150 protests took place across the United Kingdom, including Critical Mass bike rides, occupations, and mass demonstrations in Brighton, Manchester, Glasgow and London. Protests also took place in the US.\n\nOn November 9, demonstrations were held against the war at the end of the first European Social Forum in Florence, Italy. According to the organizers, 1,000,000 people were in attendance. Local authorities put attendance at 500,000.\n\nOn Saturday, November 16, in Canada an anti-war demonstration of about 2,000 people occurred at Queen's Park in Toronto.\n\nOn November 17, a large anti-war coalition held a peace march in Vancouver marching from Peace Flame Park as part of a Cross-Canada Day of Action. In Vancouver, about 3,000 people gathered in the rain. Washington must take any complaints against foreign governments to the United Nations, they said. Many accused the White House of targeting Saddam Hussein in order to try to take control of valuable oil reserves.\nAbout 1,000 marched through a shower of ice pellets in Montreal, and about 500 showed up in a blur of white snow on Parliament Hill. Rallies were held in several other cities, including Halifax, Winnipeg and Edmonton.\n\nOn January 16, 2003, protests were held worldwide in opposition to a war with Iraq, including in Turkey, Egypt, Pakistan, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina, and the United States, where Americans attended a rally in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Park Police, which oversees activities on the National Mall, stopped providing estimates of crowd size after being threatened with lawsuits by the organizers of the Million Man March, but said that protest organizers only had a permit for 30,000 demonstrators.\nOn January 18, anti-war demonstrations, focusing particularly but not exclusively on the expected war with Iraq, took place in villages, towns, and cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Dublin, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, Gothenburg, Florence, Oslo, Rotterdam, Istanbul and Cairo. In New Zealand, thousands rallied in Dunedin and Christchurch, while in Auckland protesters rallied at the Devonport naval base on January 28, opposing the deployment of the frigate HMNZS Te Mana to the Gulf.\n\nNION and ANSWER jointly organized protests in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco. Other protests took place all over the United States, including various smaller places such as Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nUpwards of 50,000 people demonstrated in San Francisco. The day started with a waterfront rally at 11 am, followed by a march down Market Street to the civic center.\n\nIn Seattle, a surprise turnout on a sunny Saturday saw over 45,000 people (Organizer and observers reports) march from the Seattle Center (after several speeches) to King Street Station-the local media all came up with nonsensical crowd numbers, from 200 up to 1,500 people. People were still vacating the starting point at the Seattle Center while the front of the march was piling up at King Street Station, the terminal point of the march; Over 5 miles of solid people-as was evidenced by one aerial photo courtesy KING-TV, showed the true scope of the march. Most of the media downplayed the numbers by taking photos at the front of the parade, on flat ground-which usually showed just a few hundred people. For some reason there was no speaker awaiting to what would have been a crowd of possibly 50,000 people-it simply ended...casual shoppers and walkers joining the crowd-the largest march of any kind in Seattle's history at the time (surpassed by the Women's March in Seattle in 2017).\n\nIn Washington, \"at least tens of thousands\", people demonstrated through the city, ending with a rally at The Mall. Among the speakers was Rev. Jesse Jackson who told the crowd that \"We are here because we choose coexistence over coannihilation.\"\n\nThe protests were planned to coincide with the January 15, birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nOn February 15, millions of people protested, in approximately 800 cities around the world. Listed by the 2004 \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the largest protest in human history, protests occurred among others in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Republic of Ireland, the United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa, Syria, India, Russia, South Korea, Japan, and even McMurdo Station in Antarctica. Perhaps the largest demonstration this day occurred in London, with up to one million protestors gathering in Hyde Park; speakers included the Reverend Jesse Jackson, London mayor Ken Livingstone, and Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy. A large demonstration, also attended by perhaps around a million, took place in Barcelona.\n\nOn March 8, three separate marches converged on Manchester Town Hall, UK. Official estimates put the number of participants at 10,000 (although this was disputed by organisers), making it the biggest political demonstration in the city since the Peterloo Massacre in 1819.\nOn March 15, Spanish and Italian cities showed some of the largest turnouts against their governments' pro-war stance, with more than 400,000 protesters in Milan, more than 300,000 in Barcelona forming a mile-long human chain, and more than 120,000 in Madrid. Marches also took place in Seville, Aranjuez, Palencia, and in the Canary Islands.\n\nMany of the protests were said to be smaller than those in the same cities a month ago; exceptions were Montreal, which upped its turnout to 200,000 and Dublin where 130,000 demonstrated. The Montreal turnout may have been related to solidarity against American anti-French sentiment, which was a common theme for many of the protesters. A further 15,000 protested in Quebec City. 55,000 protested in Paris, and 4,500 to 10,000 in Marseilles. 100,000 protested in Berlin, some 20,000 protested in Athens, close to 10,000 people marched in Tokyo, and tens of thousands in Washington, D.C. Organizers claimed between 30,000 and 45,000 people turned out, while \"The Oregonian\" and the Associated Press estimated between 20,000 and 25,000 people attended, closer to the number in Portland who participated in the January 18 protest. Thousands more marched in cities worldwide including Bangkok, Seoul, Hong Kong, Amman, Chicago, Calcutta, Melbourne, Christchurch, Dunedin, Paris, London, Portsmouth, Leeds, York, Exeter, Newcastle upon Tyne, Frankfurt, Nuremberg, Zürich, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Nicosia, Monaco, Santiago de Chile, Havana, Buenos Aires, Moscow, Seattle, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Vancouver, Halifax, Ottawa, and Toronto, as well as cities in Yemen, Turkey, Israel, and the Palestinian territories.\n\nOn March 16, more than 6,000 candlelight vigils for peace were held in more than a hundred countries.\n\nOn March 19, across the United Kingdom tens of thousands of school students staged walkouts.\n\nIn Birmingham 4,000 (BBC estimate) striking school students held a demonstration which ended at Victoria Square. Though there were some reports of some students throwing coins, West Midlands police said that the protests were \"buoyant rather than boisterous\" and no arrests were made. The demonstration later moved on to Cannon Hill Park. The son of Lord Hunt, a junior health Minister who quit his job over the march, was amongst the students in attendance.\n\nIn West Yorkshire around 500 students (BBC estimate) walked out of Ilkley Grammar School, reportedly one-third of the student body. In Bradford up to 200 students (BBC estimate) gathered in Centenary Square.\n\nDemonstrations also took place in the city centre in Leeds and Horsforth.\n\nA large protest took place at Westminster where London school students gathered.\n\nIn Manchester, 300 (eye-witness Stop the War estimate) secondary school children, Further Education students and university students met at Albert Square at 12 noon. They marched to the BBC studios where they sat down in the road at around 1pm and blocked the traffic for over an hour where their numbers grew to around 1000 demonstrators. They were filmed by anti-war activists and video clips were distributed. The students then marched around the city centre and ended up back at Albert Square at about 4pm where they remained demonstrating in front of the Town Hall for some hours. The whole of this event was filmed by anti-war activists accumulating two hours of footage.\n\nThe day after the invasion of Iraq had begun, protests were held in cities around the world. In some U.S. cities, protesters attempted to shut their respective cities down. In Germany, students staged a massive walkout. In London, a massive demonstration was held in front of the Houses of Parliament.\n\nDemonstrations were organized for a second day in a row in various US cities including Seattle, Portland, Oregon, Chicago, Atlanta, Georgia, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. In the last two cities, demonstrators closed parts of the city to traffic.\n\nMedia report about 150,000 protesters in Barcelona (other sources say 1,000,000); more than 100,000 (other sources: up to 500,000) protesters in London; some 100,000 protesters in Paris; at least 150,000 protesters altogether in many German cities; between 35,000 and 90,000 in Lisbon; around 40,000 in Bern, the largest protest in Switzerland for decades; 10,000 to 20,000 in Greece, Denmark and Finland. 250,000 protesters demonstrated in New York City according to the German Spiegel Online magazine. There were protests in Washington, D.C.. In Chicago, protesters disrupted traffic by closing down Lake Shore Drive. CNN reported that a march of over a thousand protesters in Atlanta, Georgia passed by their headquarters, upset over that network's coverage of the war. Canada likewise experienced numerous anti-war protests over the weekend. Crowds of anti-war demonstrators took to the streets of Montreal and Toronto. Calgary held three days of protests (20 March – 22nd), culminating in a march which surrounded the government building and American consulate. In the Italian city of Naples 10,000 anti-war protesters marched towards a NATO base in Bagnoli. Protests also took place in Wellington, New Zealand.; the Australian cities of Brisbane and Hobart (which were brought to a halt); Jakarta, Indonesia, where protesters converged on the US embassy; across South Korea including the capital Seoul, where Buddhist monks played drums to console the sprits of war casualties to the 2,000 protesters; across India including 15,000 in Calcutta; Bangladesh which saw a general strike (closing down many businesses and mosques); and Japan, including protests near US naval and air bases on the southern island of Okinawa. Thousands of protesters, mainly Muslims, demonstrated across the African continent. Hundreds (BBC estimate) of young people marched in Mombasa in Kenya. The Somali capital Mogadishu saw protests by students, Koranic schoolchildren, women and intellectuals. There were reports about massive conflicts between protesters and police in the Gulf state of Bahrain for the second day. On the live broadcast of the 2003 Academy Awards, several presenters and recipients made various comments against the war ranging from Susan Sarandon giving a simple peace sign to Michael Moore publicly denouncing George W. Bush upon receiving his award.\n\nMedia reports state at least 20,000 school pupils protesting in Hamburg, Germany. After the protest march, conflicts between police and protesters broke out in front of a US building in Hamburg. Protesters who were pushed back by the police began to throw stones, who in turn reacted with water cannons. There have since been serious discussions about police abuses in Hamburg, and political ramifications may follow. In the afternoon, 50,000 people protested peacefully in Leipzig following traditional prayers for peace in the city's Nikolai Church. Prayers for peace and subsequent large demonstrations at that church every Monday ('Montagsdemos') helped bring down the GDR government in East Germany in 1989. The weekly demonstrations, supported by churches, trade unions and other civic organizations, began again in January 2003 in protest to the impending invasion of Iraq. Protest marches in the afternoon were also reported in the German cities of Berlin and Freiburg. In Rome, Milan, Turin and other Italian cities, thousands of pupils and schoolteachers stayed away from school to protest against the Iraq war. The teachers union reported that 60 percent of all schools were closed. The strike had been planned weeks ago as a signal against a school reform bill, but was converted to an anti-war protest. 400 anti-war protesters tried to enter the Australian parliament in Canberra to speak to the prime minister, but were stopped by police. In the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, Maoist protesters attacked shops selling Coca-Cola and US soft drinks. Protests in front of US buildings and in fast food shops were also held in Indonesia. In Egypt, 12,000 students of two universities in Cairo protested as well as 3,000 people in the Thai capital Bangkok. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 150 people threw stones at the United States consulate.\n\nSome people demonstrated in Syria against the United States, United Kingdom and Israel. This protest was endorsed by the Syrian government. In the Islamic country of Bangladesh, 60,000 people demonstrated. Media also reports protests in front of the South Korean parliament building, linked to plans to bring South Korean forces into the war.\n\nHundreds of protesters participated in a civil disobedience in New York City. In a \"die-in\" organized by the M27 Coalition (an ad-hoc group of various anti-war organizations and individuals), 215 people were arrested after blocking traffic on 5th Avenue near the Rockefeller Center, protesting the cooperation between U.S. media and the government. Protesters also blocked traffic at various sites around the city in a coordinated protest with the theme of \"No Business As Usual.\" Protests also took place across the UK. About 250 students (Police estimate) marched on the US embassy in central London. 200 people (South Wales Police estimate) brought Cardiff city centre traffic to a standstill leading to at least six arrests. There was a lunchtime anti-war demonstration on the Humber bridge in Hull which involved some friction between motorists and protesters. In Derry, up to a dozen anti-war protesters stormed the Raytheon defense technologies company building staging a sit-in until removed by police. Thousands joined a protest in Manchester.\n\nGlobal protests did not stop in the second week of war. Some 10,000 protested in Tehran, Iran. Protesters on the march, supported by the government, chanted \"Death to Saddam\" as well as \"Death to America.\" 50,000 to 80,000 people protested in Cairo, Egypt after the Friday prayers. In Bogotá, Colombia there were violent conflicts in front of the US consulate. Protest marches and demonstrations happened also in Algiers, Algeria and in Bahrain, the Palestinian territories, South Korea, Indonesia and Pakistan. In Australia the police prevented protest marches. In Germany, protests by schoolchildren continued. In New Delhi and elsewhere in India, over 20,000 protested against the war. The largest demonstration comprised mainly Muslims, there was also a separate demonstration mainly made up of communists.\n\nIn Boston, Massachusetts, 50,000 people attended the largest rally in the city since the end of the Vietnam War. Thousands of people blocked Boylston Street in a die-in along the Boston Common. A handful of arrests were made. In the UK hundreds of protesters marched from Cowley into the centre of Oxford and thousands took to the streets of Edinburgh (Police estimated 5,000, while organizers estimated more than 10,000). Edinburgh protesters marched along Princes Street to a mass rally in the city's Meadows area.\n\n100,000 people marched through the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. According to the BBC's Jonathan Head this was the biggest anti-war demonstration to take place so far in the world's most populous Muslim nation. The day also saw the first officially sanctioned demonstration in China, where a crowd of 200 made up mostly of foreign students were allowed to chant anti-war slogans as they marched past the US embassy in Beijing but around 100 Chinese students had their banners confiscated and were blocked from entering a park where locals had gained permission to demonstrate. In Latin America there were rallies in Santiago, Mexico City, Montevideo, Buenos Aires and Caracas. In Germany at least 40,000 people formed a human chain between the northern cities of Munster and Osnabrueck 35 miles apart. Also about 23,000 took part in marches in Berlin, ending in a rally in Tiergarten park, protests took place in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, where 25 people were arrested as they tried to block the entrance to a US air base. Marches were also held in Paris, Moscow, Budapest, Warsaw and Dublin.\n\nIn Oakland, California, police fired rubber bullets and beanbags at protesters and dockworkers outside the port, injuring at least a dozen demonstrators and six longshoremen standing nearby. Protestors were protesting the Iraq War related action performed by American President Lines and defense contractor Stevedoring Services of America. Most of the 500 demonstrators were dispersed peacefully, but a crowd of demonstrators was blocking traffic on private property near the port and failed to disperse after police warnings. The Oakland Police Chief said demonstrators also threw objects and bolts at the police, and said the use of weapons was necessary to disperse the crowd. He indicated that the rubber bullets were used to respond to direct illegal action and the longshoremen were caught in the crossfire. A dockworker spokesman reported that police gave two minutes to disperse, then opened fire rather than making arrests. Demonstrators also claim that the police took direct aim at them, rather than firing in the air or at the ground. Thirty-one people were arrested. Demonstrators regrouped and marched to the Oakland Federal Building. In New York, United States, protesters targeted the Carlyle Group, an investment firm with deep connections to the war. About 20 protesters were arrested in a planned civil disobedience, but police then also surrounded and arrested close to 100 people who were simply watching the protest from across the street.\n\nFollowing the period of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat experienced a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often on the occasion of anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu Ghraib prison), calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.\n\nProtests sponsored by A.N.S.W.E.R. were held in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and Los Angeles to demonstrate against the Iraq War three days after the fall of Baghdad. In Washington, the march route took the group of 30,000 past offices of several mass media organizations, and companies such as Bechtel and Halliburton.\n\nTens of thousands of people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., San Francisco, Reno, Nevada and other cities around the world, in opposition to the occupation of Iraq. Protesters also advocated for the return of American troops to the United States, and for the protection of civil liberties.\n\nThe Washington DC rally attracted 20,000 (BBC estimate) protesters. The protest ended with a rally at the Washington Monument, within sight of the White House. Protesters also called for the repeal of the USA PATRIOT Act. The Washington and San Francisco protests were jointly organized by ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism) and United for Peace and Justice.\n\nA pro-war demonstration in Washington organized by Free Republic attracted only dozens (BBC estimate) of people.\n\nGeorge Bush's state visit to the UK was met with peaceful anti-war protests in London, attracting 100,000 (police estimate) to 200,000 (organisers' estimate) people, and culminating in the toppling of an effigy of Bush in Trafalgar Square.\n\nMore than 100,000 people demonstrated in Rome and other Italian cities during Bush's visit to Pope John Paul II, who had expressed his opposition to the war in numerous occasions. Ten thousand police patrolled the conference site.\n\nANSWER Coalition sponsored a demonstration in Washington, D.C., marching from the White House through working-class neighborhoods to the house of Donald Rumsfeld on Kalorama Road NW near Embassy Row. In addition, more than 10,000 citizens marched in San Francisco, as well as a counter-protest with hundreds of pro-war supporters.\n\nAs part of the 2004 Republican National Convention protests, United for Peace and Justice organized a mass march, one of the largest in U.S. history, in which protesters marched past Madison Square Garden, the site of the convention. The march included hundreds of separate contingents as well as individual marchers. The group One Thousand Coffins held a procession of one thousand full-scale flag-draped cardboard coffins, commemorating each of the U.S. fallen troops as of that date, carried by a nationwide coalition of citizens, veterans, clergy and families of the fallen. Several hundred members of Billionaires for Bush held a mock countermarch. Estimates of crowd size ranged from 120,000 (unnamed police spokesman) to over 500,000 (organizers, second unnamed police source). In March, 2007 NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne stated about the RNC protests: \"You certainly had 800,000 on August 29th.\"\n\nOrganizers held a pre-march press conference in front of thousands on 7th Avenue. Several people spoke in opposition to the war in Iraq and Bush administration policies including Michael Moore, Jesse Jackson, Congressman Charles Rangel, and a father who had lost his son in Iraq. The whole event lasted six hours, with the lead contingent finishing the march long before thousands of people could even move from the starting point. The City government, under Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had earlier denied the protesters a permit to hold a rally in Central Park following the march, citing concern for the park's grass. The West Side Highway was offered instead, but organizers refused, citing exorbitant costs for the extra sound equipment and problems for the location. Organizers encouraged people to go to Central Park following the march's conclusion in Union Square.\nDisturbances were minor. New York Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly reported about 200 arrests with 9 felonies—most of them occurring after the march had concluded.\n\nA large group of people assembled at the Women's Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery for the National Memorial Procession, described as \"A Trail of Mourning and Truth from Iraq to the White House\". The theme of the event was \"Mourn the dead. Heal the wounded. End the war.\" Participants were encouraged to dress in black to symbolize mourning. Cindy Sheehan was among the participants at this demonstration. Speeches were made by veterans, members of military families, family members of fallen soldiers, and others. Following the speeches, participants marched from Arlington National Cemetery to the Ellipse in Washington, D.C., carrying cardboard coffins to symbolize the war dead. Following the march, another rally was held, where the coffins carried on the march were placed with more coffins placed at the Ellipse earlier. Following the second rally, 28 people, including Michael Berg (father of the American civilian contractor Nicholas Berg who was killed by insurgents in Iraq), were arrested while attempting to deliver the names of fallen heroes to the White House.\n\nApproximately 10,000 people attending the Million Worker March in Washington, D.C. conducted a pro-labor demonstration, with a very heavy additional focus against the war in Iraq as well.\n\nTwo protests were held in Ottawa against George W. Bush's first official visit to Canada. A rally and march in the early afternoon was upwards of fifteen thousand (or 5,000 according to police). An evening rally on Parliament Hill drew another 15,000 and featured a speech by Brandon Hughey, an American soldier seeking refuge in Canada after refusing to fight in Iraq. Bush's stop on 1 December in Halifax, Nova Scotia drew between 4,000 and 5,000 protesters.\n\nThousands of people attended multiple protest rallies and marches held throughout Washington, D.C. on the day of George W. Bush's second inaugural to protest the war in Iraq and other policies of the Bush Administration.\n\nProtests to mark the second anniversary of start of the Iraq War were held across the world, in the U.S., United Kingdom, Canada, Central America, South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. (Some protests were also held on March 20). In Glasgow, Scotland about 1,000 people (BBC estimate) attended a rally where some of the names of people who had so-far died in the conflict were read out, along with a \"name and shame\" list of Scottish MPs who backed the war. Speakers included Maxine Gentle, whose soldier brother Gordon was killed in Iraq. According to a survey (mainly of the reports of organizers), it has been claimed that, across the world, over one million people marched. The protests had been called by the Anti-War Assembly of the 2005 World Social Forum an annual conference of the alternative globalization movement which took place in Porto Alegre, Brazil on 26 January – 31, and were supported by coalitions from all over the world.\n\nAn officer of the German army, Major Florian Pfaff, was exonerated by the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (German administrative court) after refusing to take part in the development of software likely to be used in the Iraq War.\n\nCindy Sheehan, mother of slain U.S. soldier Casey Sheehan, set up a protest camp outside the ranch of vacationing president George W. Bush in Crawford, Texas. Sheehan, who previously met with Bush in a short encounter before the media that she described as dismissive and disrespectful, demanded that Bush meet with her and stop using the deaths of soldiers, including her son, as a justification for remaining in Iraq.\n\nProtests were held in the USA and Europe. Police estimated that about 150,000 people took part in Washington, D.C., 15,000 in Los Angeles, California, 10,000 in London, 20,000 in San Francisco, and more than 2,000 in San Diego, California. Additionally, in London, organizers claim 100,000 attended similar protests, but police place the figure at 10,000.\n\nMassive popular demonstrations against the U.S.-led war in Iraq, in addition to U.S.-backed economic policies in Latin America, were held in Argentina surrounding the November 4–5 Fourth Summit of the Americas.\n\nCoordinated protests were held to mark the third anniversary of the invasion of Iraq. Major protests occurred in Baghdad, Basra, London, New York City, Washington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, Madrid, Rome, Sydney, Tokyo, Seoul, Istanbul, Toronto and Dublin. Demonstration organizers in London said this marks the first coordinated protest in Iraq, Britain and the United States. More than 500 antiwar events were planned for the week of March 15–21 in the United States; thousands or tens of thousands demonstrated in San Francisco, New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., 200 people marched to The Pentagon to deliver a faux coffin and bag of ashes to United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. Two dozen people were arrested for crossing over a barrier around the Pentagon in an act of civil disobedience. They were cited for \"failure to obey lawful orders,\" according to Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman. Footage from the protest was incorporated into this scene from the movie The Identified.\n\nTurn-out for the United States events was damaged by splits between organizing groups such as UFPJ and ANSWER.\n\nThousands from around the south marched in Atlanta, Georgia from the King Center to a rally at Piedmont Park to mark the 3rd anniversary of the Iraq war and the 38th anniversary of the assassination of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. The Southern Regional March for Peace in Iraq/Justice at Home was organized by the April 1st Coalition and speakers included Dr. Joseph Lowery, Rev. Tim McDonald, and Damu Smith.\n\nA coalition of United States-based groups, initiated by United for Peace and Justice, Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, National Organization for Women, Friends of the Earth, U.S. Labor Against the War, Climate Crisis Coalition, People's Hurricane Relief Fund, National Youth and Student Peace Coalition, and Veterans for Peace held a national mobilization against the war in New York City on April 29.\n\nMembers of the Port Militarization Resistance in Olympia, WA protested the shipment of 300 Army Stryker vehicles to Iraq through the Port of Olympia. Dozens of arrests resulted from the direct actions of protesters such as locking arms to block roads which the Army used to reach the port.\n\nNine members of the Derry Anti-War Coalition, based in Northern Ireland, entered the Derry premises of Raytheon. The occupation of the plant lasted for eight hours, after which point riot police entered the building and removed the occupants. Charges of aggravated burglary and unlawful entry were brought against all nine.\n\nA national anti-war demonstration took place in Manchester, England coinciding with the Labour Party Annual Conference which also took place in the city on this date. The organisers, the Stop the War Coalition, estimated 50,000 people on the march. Police estimates were initially 8,000 revised upwards to 20,000. The local Stop the War organisers considered that it was the largest demonstration in the history of the city since Chartist times in the mid-19th Century. The event was followed by a Stop the War Alternative conference (alternative, that is, to the stage-managed Labour Conference).\n\nActions across the United States took place in nearly every state. An organization called World Can't Wait organized the nationwide event. Demonstrations took place in vicinities such as New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Houston, and other places. Over 200 protests were organized.\n\nMalachi Ritscher committed suicide by self-immolation on the side of the Kennedy Expressway near downtown Chicago during the morning rush hour of Friday, November 3, 2006, apparently as a protest against the Iraq war and more generally \"for the mayhem and turmoil caused by my country\".\n\nThe court martial of military resister Lt. Ehren Watada has been marked by protests. On January 4, 2007, Iraq Veterans Against the War Deployed established a protest camp called \"Camp Resistance\" at Fort Lewis in support of Watada. The same day, some 200 people protested his prosecution in San Francisco, with twenty-eight arrested after engaging in civil disobedience.\n\nNumerous groups organized demonstrations in response to a January 10 speech by George W. Bush, announcing an increase of U.S troop levels in Iraq by 21,500. A small number of protests occurred in the wake of the Wednesday night speech, including one in Boston which resulted in 6 arrests for blocking traffic. Organizers from MoveOn.org and TrueMajority.org each received reports of some 500–600 protests that were held nationwide on January 11.\n\nThe January 27, 2007 Iraq War protest drew anywhere from \"tens of thousands\" to \"hundreds of thousands\" Washington DC to protest.\n\nIn Tacoma, Washington peace activists campaigned to prevent the military from shipping 300 Stryker armored vehicles to Iraq. 23 protesters were arrested including T.J. Johnson who serves in the City Council of Olympia.\nThe arrests came shortly after a small convoy of 12 to 15 Army vehicles arrived at a storage yard at the port. More vehicles, including Stryker armored fighting vehicles, arrived late Monday and early Tuesday, as protesters shouted the chants \"You don't have to go\" and \"We are the majority.\"\n\nRoughly 100 protesters were arrested in front of the White House following a service at Washington National Cathedral in commemoration of the fourth anniversary of the Iraq War and a march to the White House.\n\nApproximately 10,000 to 20,000 anti-war protesters marched to The Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, with several thousand pro-war protesters lining the route. Other protests and counter-demonstrations in the USA were held in Austin, Texas, Seattle, Washington, Chicago, Illinois, Los Angeles, California (5,000 to 6,000), San Francisco, California, San Diego, California, and Hartford, Connecticut.\nTens of thousands marched in Madrid, Spain, with smaller protests in Turkey, Greece, Australia, Belgium, Britain, and Canada.\n\nA march took place from the White House to the Capitol on September 15, 2007. It was organized by Veterans for Peace and the Answer Coalition. Volunteers were recruited for a civil disobedience action, which included a die-in. Volunteers signed up to take on the name of a soldier or civilian who died because of the war, and lay down around the Peace Monument. In attendance were politicians such as Ralph Nader. Police arrested more than 190 demonstrators who crossed police lines in front of the Capitol. Chemical spray was used by Capitol Police.\n\nOrganizers estimated that nearly 100,000 people attended the rally and march. That number could not be confirmed; police did not give their own estimate. Associated press reported \"several thousand.\" A permit for the march obtained in advance by the ANSWER Coalition had projected 10,000.\n\nTroops Out Now Coalition organized a rally and march starting from the encampment in front of the Capitol Building. TroopsOutNow.org estimated 5,000 marched. A group of protesters, mainly youth, blocked sections of Constitution and Pennsylvania Avenue, including portions not on the march route. As of 8:40 PM, September 29, the demonstrators had set up tents and had not moved, after occupying the street for over 4 hours.\n\nThousands of anti-war protesters marched through Washington, D.C. on the fifth anniversary of the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq, some splattering red paint on government offices and scuffling with police. Protesters, including many veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals. Others hurled balloons full of paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings housing defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin.\n\nSeveral other protests took place during the days leading up to the five-year anniversary of the Iraq War. On March 7, in Washington, D.C. for example, several churches held services to pray for the safety of U.S. troops and an end to the war. In the afternoon the churchgoers marched to the Hart Senate Office Building with the intention of asking U.S. Senators to discontinue U.S.-funded terrorism. At least forty of the protesters were arrested as they entered the building and began praying for peace.\n\nThousands of protesters marched from the Mall in Washington D.C. to the grounds of the Pentagon, and then to the Crystal City district of Arlington, Virginia. This area of Arlington is the home to offices of several defense contractors, such as KBR and General Dynamics. Protesters carried mock coffins representing the victims of U.S. conflicts and placed them in front of the office buildings. Virginia State police and Arlington County police greeted the protesters and reported no arrests. Among the protesters was a group of black block members.\n\nUnited for Peace and Justice held a march on Wall Street on April 4, 2009 against military spending in Iraq.\n\nOn March 20, 2010, a multi-city anti-war event was held in the United States to protest the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The event was organized by A.N.S.W.E.R. with support from other civil society actors such as the \"Topanga Peace Alliance\" and the Teamsters. The scheduling of the event ties it to the seventh anniversary of the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. In Washington, D.C. thousands marched past the White House, some bearing coffins draped with various flags to symbolize fatalities of the wars. Others enacted mock attacks on the White House using cardboard combat drones. A parallel demonstration took place in Hollywood, California called \"U.S. Out of Afghanistan and Iraq Now!\". In addition to the big NGOs, this was supported by local grassroots organisations such as \"LA Workers' Voice\" and \"Long Beach Area Peace Network\". Thousands of people slowly made their way down Hollywood Boulevard at 2 p.m. dressed as zombies and other undead.\nOver 100 protesters were arrested outside the White House. More protesters gathered in Hollywood.\n\nVeterans for Peace, Occupy Chicago and a slew of coalition partners convened the No-NATO protests in Chicago. About 8,000 marchers took Michigan Avenue the full length to Cermak, within several blocks of the NATO Summit at the Hyatt Regency.\n\nAt the intersection of Cermak and Michigan, Iraq Veterans Against the War convened a rally. For the second time in United States history, soldiers and marines relinquished their military medals. The first time this occurred was in 1971.\n\nAnarchist author and activist Peter Gelderloos has criticised the protests against the Iraq War for their complete ineffectiveness at stopping the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1284599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1284599", "title": "Pub session", "text": "Pub session\n\nA pub session (seisiún in Irish; seshoon in Manx Gaelic) is performing music in the setting of a local pub, in which the music-making is intermingled with the consumption of ale, stout, and beer and conversation. Performers sing and play traditional songs and tunes from the Irish, English, Scottish and Manx traditions, using instruments such as the fiddle, accordion, concertina, flute, tin whistle, uilleann pipes, tenor banjo, guitar, and bodhrán.\n\nSinging and consuming alcohol have been practised together from ancient times, but the written evidence is fragmentary until the 16th century. In Shakespeare's \"Henry IV\", Hal and Falstaff discuss drinking and playing the \"tongs and the bones\". There are depictions of pub singing in paintings by Teniers (1610–1690) Brouwer (1605/6-1638) and Jan Steen (1625/5-1656).\n\nThe 1830 Beer Act abolished the levy on beer and within a single year 400 new pubs opened and within 8 years there were 46,000. The number peaked in the 1870s and declined after 1900. By the 1850s, an increasing number of student songs and commercial song-books were published across Europe. The most famous was the \"Scottish Students' Song Book\" by John Stuart Blackie (1809–1895). The mixture of traditional songs with hints of erotic humour continues to this day. The Irish tradition also benefited from the compilation of O'Neill's \"Music of Ireland\", a compilation of 1,850 pieces of Irish session and dance music, published initially by Francis O'Neill (1848–1936) in 1903.\n\nOne of the most popular drinking songs, \"Little Brown Jug,\" dates from the 1860s. By 1908 Percy Grainger had begun to record folk singers, but not in their natural habitat—the pub. In 1938 A.L. Lloyd persuaded his employers at the BBC to record the singers in the Eel's Foot pub in Eastbridge, Suffolk.\n\nAt The Eel's Foot, 1939–47, the songs performed included: \"False Hearted Knight\", \"The Dark-Eyed Sailor\", \"The Princess Royal\", \"The Foggy Dew\", \"Underneath Her Apron\", \"Pleasant and Delightful\", \"The Blackbird.\" Surprisingly, one of the songs was \"Poor Man's Heaven\" an American IWW song (Industrial Workers of the World), dating from about 1920. The oldest singer there was William \"Velvet\" Brightwell (1865–1960). In 1947 the BBC made more recordings there and broadcast them as \"Anglia Sings\" on 19 November 1947. Almost all of the participants were in their 50s and 60s. Six years later the first folk club opened in Newcastle upon Tyne, and the average age was in the 20s.\n\nThe fiddle has predominated since the 17th century. The melodeon became popular in the 1890s. By the 1950s the accordion took over, particularly in Scotland. By the 1960s the guitar was the instrument most frequently heard in a pub. Nowadays so many people can afford instruments that ensemble playing is the norm. Celtic tunes are popular, even in England, however English music is enjoying a large revival currently, due in part to 'new-folk' artists playing traditional English music, such as Bellowhead and Eliza Carthy. Some people go to folk festivals simply in order to play along with others in the beer tent.\n\nEach session has its own informal rules as to which instruments are acceptable and in what number. Some sessions may have a strict \"'traditional' instruments only\" rule whereas others will accept anyone who shows up to play with any instrument. The word \"traditional\" is used loosely as sessions themselves are a relatively recently revived phenomenon and some instruments considered 'traditional,' such as the bouzouki are in fact relatively new to the genres played at a session. It is wise to ask about what is expected at a particular session before bringing a non-'traditional' instrument.\n\nGenerally there can be an unlimited number of fiddles, flutes, accordions and tin whistles. The bodhrán is common in Irish sessions, but many sessions prefer that only one person play the bodhrán at a time. Uilleann pipes are common in Irish sessions, but the more commonly known Great Highland Bagpipes are never used in a session, because they drown out other instruments. Mandolins, banjos, citterns and bouzoukis are welcome in moderation. Guitars and dulcimers are frequently allowed in sessions without strict \"'traditional' instruments only\" rules.\n\nThere are \"open sessions\", when anyone who wishes can play, and \"closed sessions\", where the playing is restricted to a group. The general rules are fairly simple, but depend on the kind of session. In general, pub sessions are not places for learning an instrument. It is expected that those taking part have attained competence in playing their instrument. Some sessions are wholly instrumental while others will engage the crowd with singing. It is customary to introduce oneself to the other participants before joining in. There will usually be a leader or oldest member who sets the tone and keeps the session running smoothly; often leader(s) do not appear to be leaders at all. Occasionally, even the leaders of a session may not realize that they lead.\n\nPractically, however, there are always leaders at a session, by the nature of human dynamics. Some sessions follow a round-robin structure, others have a more free-for-all approach, and the leader(s) of a session should be observed to see how this particular session is run. Due to freeform nature of the session, there is always an element of serendipity and there is an atmosphere of anticipation and an expectation of tolerance from all present.\n\nIt is frowned upon when one openly criticises people who know only one song or only a few tunes. Sessions are occasions to be enjoyed by all participants and if others are accepted members of the group, it's not up to one person (other than the leaders of the session) to decide that they are not welcome.\n\nIn England and Wales the Licensing Act 2003 came into force in 2005. It could be interpreted as meaning that any performer would be obliged to give prior notification to police, fire brigade and environmental health. Following much lobbying by various groups, the law settled down to allow \"spontaneous\" events and religious events.\n\n"}

A drop in the oxygen carried in blood is known as hypoxemia; a rise in arterial carbon dioxide levels is called hypercapnia. Respiratory failure is classified as either Type I or Type II, based on whether there is a high carbon dioxide level. The definition of respiratory failure in clinical trials usually includes increased respiratory rate, abnormal blood gases (hypoxemia, hypercapnia, or both), and evidence of increased work of breathing.\n\nThe normal partial pressure reference values are: oxygen PaO more than , and carbon dioxide PaCO lesser than .\n\nSeveral types of condition can potentially result in respiratory failure:\n\n\nType 1 respiratory failure is defined as a low level of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) without an increased level of carbon dioxide in the blood (hypercapnia), and indeed the PCO may be normal or low. It is typically caused by a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch; the volume of air flowing in and out of the lungs is not matched with the flow of blood to the lungs. The basic defect in type 1 respiratory failure is failure of oxygenation characterized by:\n\nThis type of respiratory failure is caused by conditions that affect oxygenation such as:\n\nHypoxemia (PaO2 <8kPa) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.0kPa).\n\nThe basic defect in type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by:\n\nType 2 respiratory failure is caused by inadequate alveolar ventilation; both oxygen and carbon dioxide are affected.

Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are required in cases of severe respiratory failure (PaO2 less than 50 mmHg). Respiratory stimulants such as doxapram are rarely used, and if the respiratory failure resulted from an overdose of sedative drugs such as opioids or benzodiazepines, then the appropriate antidote (naloxone or flumazenil, respectively) will be given.\n\nThere is tentative evidence that in those with respiratory failure identified before arrival in hospital, continuous positive airway pressure can be useful when started before conveying to hospital.\n\n"}

{"id": "18305454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18305454", "title": "São João National Theatre", "text": "São João National Theatre\n\nThe São João Theatre (), commonly referred to as the \"São João National Theatre\" is a Portuguese theatre and concert venue in civil parish of Cedofeita, Santo Ildefonso, Sé, Miragaia, São Nicolau e Vitória, in the municipality of Porto, in northern Portugal.\n\nThe primitive theatre was constructed at the end of the 18th century (1796) by Italian Vicente Mazzoneschi, and inaugurated on 13 May 1798, as the \"Teatro do Príncipe\" (\"Prince's Theatre\"). It was named in honour of the prince-regent John VI, who later became King. The construction firm of Francisco de Almada Mendonça was charged with the project, and produced a four-story building with its principal facade decorated with the royal coat-of-arms under an inscription.\n\nBut, on 11 April 1908, there was a fire, destroying the theatre interior, and a new structure was built on its former site. Before its destruction, the theatre had a markedly horseshoe-shaped plan. Its rounded ceiling was painted by Joaquim Rafael and had in 1856 received a new painting by Paulo Pizzi. The building included four rows of booths, with the booth for the royal family located centrally on the second floor. The large atrium, and the corridors large supported by access from large staircases. Along the second floor was a magnificent concert hall. Generally, the theatre had excellent acoustics. The stage wall was painted by Sequeira, but was later replaced in 1825 by paintings contracted to the Spaniard João Rodrigues, and later, Palucci. Until 1838, the theatre was lit by tallow candles, and later by similar candles lit by oil.\n\nOn 11 April 1908, the Civil Governor nominated a commission to promote the construction of a new theatre. \n\nA competition opened on October 8, presided by engineer Basílio Alberto de Sousa Pinto, Xavier Esteves, Casimiro Jerónimo de Faria, architect José Marques da Silva and the director of public works, Isidro de Campos, whom immediately denounced the conditions of the tender. A new competition was announced a week later, based on slight alterations to the original provisions. Preliminary project proposals were accepted on 22 February 1910. It was Marques da Silva who obtained the first prize and João de Moura Coutinho de Almeida d'Eça, the runner-up. Before the competition was held, the winning project was designated to Moura Coutinho, then director of the \"Direcção das Obras Públicas\" (\"Directorate of Public Works\") in Braga. The winning project was approved on 6 May, during a municipal session, with the work awarded to the company Soconstroi. \n\nWork began in 1911 under the direction of Porto architect José Marques da Silva. The inner, horseshoe-shaped concert hall included a ceiling painted by the artists José de Brito and Acácio Lino, while the entrance hall was decorated with sculptural work by Henrique Araújo Moreira, Diogo de Macedo and José Fernandes de Sousa Caldas. On the main facade, of sober design, are four reliefs representing four feelings: \"Kindness\", \"Pain\", \"Hatred\" and \"Love\", created by Diogo de Macedo and Sousa Caldas. The building was complete in 1918. Its inauguration was held on 7 March 1920, with the presentation of Giuseppe Verdi's Aida.\n\nA projection area was constructed in 1932, and the theatre began to operate a cinema, then designated \"São João Cine\".\n\nOn 26 February 1982, the building was designated a \"Imóvel de Interesse Público\" (\"Property of Public Interest\"), under Decree 28/82 (Diário da República, Série 1, 47).\n\nIn 1992, the theatre was acquired by the State from the family of Pinto da Costa. At that time, the work on the installation of security features and public services were undertaken on site. These were elaborated the following year with upgrades to dressing rooms, the stage, washrooms and remodelling of the electrical systems, which included the installation of an electrical generator.\n\nTwo years later (23 November) a proposal was issued by the DRPorto, to reclassify the Theatre as a Portuguese National Monument. Following a period of remodelling, the theatre began to function regularly, under the designation the \"Teatro Nacional de São João\" (\"São João National Theatre\"). In addition to general cleaning, the work included the consolidation and restoration of the exterior facades, recuperation of the decorative sculptures, treatment of surfaces in pigmented mortar and the installation of new woods and iron. \n\nDuring the course of this transition, attempts to reclassify the institution continued; on 22 April 1996, a dispatch by the Vice-President of IPPAR, devolved to the DRPorto its proposal for reformulation. On 12 September 2005, a new proposal was issued by that entity. This new proposal was favourably accepted by the deliberative council of IGESPAR (the successor to IPPAR), which also proposed that no special protection area should be needed, owing to the sites inclusion with the broader Historical Zone of Porto (an area already designated). The process was ratified by the \"Secretário de Estado da Cultura\" (Secretary of State for Culture\")\" on 14 October 2010.\n\nThe theatre is centrally located in Porto, occupying a complete block, in front of the \"Praça da Batalha\", between the \"Rua de Augusto Rosa\" (on its left) and the \"Travessa do Cativ\" (on its right), with the \"Rua do Cativo\" to the rear.\n\nThe rectangular plan is covered in tile roofing, with its principal facade found on one of the two smaller sides, framed laterally by rustic cornerstones and accentuated by capricious urns and garlands. The \"noble floor\" with three arches on steeped pilasters is inscribed under columns with broad shafts and Ionian capitals, while the doors of the lodges are topped by interrupted pediments.\n\nThree loggias exist on extended balconies, over sills in the thickness of the walls and interconnected by a balcony running on 4 strong consoles in the same alignment as the ordering columns. The arches have a shutter in support and transition to the entablature, which opens a frieze corresponding to a mezzanine of three openings and bas-reliefs alluding to the human passions (\"Pain\", \"Hate\", \"Kindness\" and \"Love\"), subtitled on the architrave. Above, the denticulated cord ends at the frieze and the beginning of a strong cornice based on rebound corbels, which are dense, in a repetitive rhythm that runs throughout the building. Crowning the facade is the gable, rising over a high platform, with rhythmic fenestration and formal, ornamented balustrades. The lateral facades are symmetrical. On the ground floor, there are 3 arched doorways (topped by a running balcony and supported by 4 consoles), flanked by 2 small doors, with an interrupted curvilinear pediment. Here, 3 doors (that are repeated in the two successive upper floors) with balconies and sills, are interspersed between four, embedded Ionic pilasters. The set is flanked by strong masks, on intermediate floor, on which a window opens at the top, with small gap at the bottom. Corresponding to the stage area, there are high, open slits; in this area, the body of the theatre rises above the entablature, accompanying the broken forms or gables, underlined by the frame and ornamental strip. \n\nOn the ground floor, the vestibule occupies the whole width of the building, with access through the 3 doors of the main facade and lateral entranceways. From this space you can access the corridors leading to the audience seating or, to the side, the stairs to the upper floors. The avant-foyer and foyer are located on the first floor and occupy the entire width of the building, with two rooms for a restaurant and smoking room. With its double height, corresponding to the main hall and facade, the interior is profusely decorated along the windows and balustrades, with a wide oculus on the transition doors to the \"avant-foyer\". The two floors correspond to the first-order royal boxes, and, on the second floor, the second-order boxes. The \"avant-foyer\" and \"foyer\" allow circulation with its balconies. On the last floors are the galleries and the amphitheater, forming a single group of places, but with different accesses (one at the level of the lower floors and another at the level of the highest). On the first floor of the amphitheater is a storage room and a paint shop. From the ground floor, the stairs lead to the galleries and amphitheatres, by two direct, exterior entrances, along the lateral facades. The layout of the horseshoe-shaped hall holds 1328 seats, including the 6 large boxes, with one at the height of the first floor, intended as an alternative to a royal box. Between the audience and the stage is the orchestra pit, with independent entrances from the side facades. The stage and dressing rooms have side and rear entrances, that can be divided by a metallic cloth.\n\n\n"}

It is inspired by the 16th century French peasant Martin Guerre. It was first produced by Theatre Plus under the direction of Duncan McIntosh in Toronto (1993) at the Jane Mallett Theatre. It won the 1994 Dora Mavor Moore Award. It was then developed further by the Canadian theatrical producer Livent and went on to be produced by Chicago’s Goodman Theatre in 1996. It was directed by David Petrarca and received the Best Musical 1996 Jefferson Award. \"Variety\" said the show was “so fresh, so resoundingly complete and rewarding, that there is talk her first major show may yet land on Broadway”. In 1997, it was once again produced in Toronto by the Canadian Stage Company again directed by David Petrarca. Arden was nominated with a Chalmers Award for her work.\n\nIn 2018, it was performed in concert at the Charlottetown Festival in Prince Edward Island, starring Adam Brazier, Joseé Boudreau, Rebecca Poff and Craig Fair. Narration was provided by Julain Molnar, who originated the role of Bertrande. \n\n...In 1991, she began working on the Martin Guerre story, creating music and lyrics at the same time. The story is famous, a 16th-century tale of a young French peasant farm boy who was forced into an arranged marriage. The unhappy Martin Guerre deserted his wife Bertrande and baby son, returning eight years later to assume his position as head of the family and heir to the Guerre land. According to legend, Bertrande readily accepted her husband, who had apparently been transformed into a loving and caring partner. Four years later, however, she suddenly denounced him as an impostor, and he was jailed and sent to trial.\n"}

Following a sellout run at both the Live Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne in 2007 and its transfer to the Royal National Theatre, it returned to the National for a limited season before heading out on a UK Tour. A Broadway production opened on 30 September 2010 following previews from 14 September 2010 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre and played a limited run until 12 December 2010; it featured the original cast. \"The Pitmen Painters\" opened in London's West End in October 2011 at the Duchess Theatre. The Canadian premiere of \"The Pitmen Painters\" ran in February 2012 at Theatre Aquarius in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nHall learnt about the group from a \"Guardian\" article by Martin Wainwright. This encouraged him to buy the book \"Pitmen Painters: The Ashington Group 1934-1984\" by William Feaver about the group, on which the play is loosely based. \n\nA February 2014 production by United Players at the Jericho Theatre in Vancouver sold out many of its performances.

{"id": "1616622", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1616622", "title": "V-Day (movement)", "text": "V-Day (movement)\n\nV-Day, February 14, is a global activist movement to end violence against women and girls started by author, playwright and activist Eve Ensler. It has been co-ordinated by a 501(c)(3) organization since 1998 which allows royalty-free performances of \"The Vagina Monologues\" to be held for charity every February 14. Ensler has been quoted as saying that it was women's reactions to the play that inspired her and her colleagues to launch V-Day. The 'V' in V-Day stands for Victory, Valentine and Vagina.\n\nIn 1998, a non-profit charity, \"V-Day\", was incorporated with the intent of using performances of \"The Vagina Monologues\" to raise money to benefit female victims of violence and sexual abuse. Since its inception, the movement has expanded its use of art and activism to include screenings and reading — most notably of the documentary \"Until The Violence Stops\" (2004) and the compilation \"A Memory, Monologue, A Rant, and a Prayer\". Marches and festivals that have been held as part of the movement include UNTIL THE VIOLENCE STOPS: NYC (June 2006), and the ten-year anniversary V TO THE TENTH at the Louisiana Superdome and New Orleans Arena in 2008.\n\nBeginning in early 2001, V-Day activities expanded to the international stage, with V-Day hosting leadership summits for women in Afghanistan and a gathering of activists in Rome. V-Day also launched the Karama program in the Middle East and coordinated community briefings on the missing and murdered women of Juarez, Mexico. In some societies where censorship forbids performances of \"The Vagina Monologues\", events revolve around other works developed by V-Day, including the book \"A Memory, a Monologue, a Rant, and a Prayer\", an anthology of writings about violence against women. V-Day included the first ever all transgender version of \"The Vagina Monologues\" in 2004, with a performance by eighteen notable transwomen under the mentoring of Jane Fonda and Andrea James of Deep Stealth Productions.\n\nConsistent growth of the movement led to 5,400 events in 1,500 locations taking place in 2010 alone. It was then estimated that $80 million had been raised since the movement's inception with over 12,000 community-based anti-violence programs and safe houses in The Congo, Haiti, Kenya, Egypt and Iraq receiving funding.\n\nAccording to its website, V-Day's vision is \"\"a world where women live safely and freely\".\" They aim to tackle issues such as rape and battery of women, incest, female genital mutilation and human trafficking of female sex slaves.\n\nThe organization seeks to strengthen existing anti-violence efforts by raising money and consciousness, and to lay the groundwork for new educational and protective legislative endeavours for women throughout the world. V-Day's work is grounded in four core beliefs. These stated as:\n\n\nThere are two types of V-Campaigns: The College Campaign and the Community Campaign.\n\nThrough these V-Day campaigns, local volunteers and college students produce annual benefit performances of \"The Vagina Monologues\", \"A Memory, A Monologue, A Rant and A Prayer\" and \"Any One of Us: Words From Prison\". They also offer screenings of the V-Day documentary \"Until The Violence Stops\" and the PBS documentary \"What I Want My Words to Do to You\", and conduct Spotlight Campaign Teach-Ins and V-Men workshops, to raise awareness and funds for anti-violence groups within their communities.\n\nEach year V-Day spotlights a particular group of women who are experiencing violence with the goal of putting a worldwide media spotlight on this area and to raise funds to aide groups who are addressing it. For example, V-Day advocated for change throughout the Congo in 2007 by launching the \"Stop Raping Our Greatest Resource: Power To The Women and Girls of the Democratic Republic of Congo\" campaign. The 2011 spotlight focused on the women and girls of Haiti. In this year, the efforts in the Congo led to the opining of the survivors community City of Joy in collaboration with Fondation Panzi and UNICEF. Located in Bukavu, the facilities provide 180 Congolese women per year with group therapy, self-defense training, sexuality education, ecology / horticulture education and cultural events.\n\nWith the support of Eve Ensler and the publicity from the V-Day campaign, One Billion Rising, a global protest to end violence and promote justice and gender equality, was founded on February 14, 2012, the fifteenth V-Day. The name described a UN and WHO estimate for the number of women in the world who are likely to be raped or beaten at least once. The project urges women and men to dance and rise up in opposition to violence. It has reached over 200 countries in regions such as North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with actions in each area dependent on local circumstances, traditions, and religions.\n\nIn the early 2000s, some right wing critics attacked V-Day for \"hijacking the occasion of Valentine's Day\". These conservative critics argued that feminists should not be admonishing people to consider rape, incest and violence on an occasion designed to celebrate love and romance. Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy stated that \"V-Day embodies the same double standard and dishonesty that has characterized most feminist pronouncements for decades\" and urged people to \"take back Valentines Day\". \n\nOne critique came from Clara Eugenia Rojas in her 2005 publication \"The ‘V-Day’ March in Mexico: Appropriation and Misuse of Local Women’s Activism.\" Following the murders of the women in Juarez, Mexico, V-Day became involved with this cause. Rojas, a local feminist activist, noted that immediately following the discovery of the bodies, there was little that she nor anyone else could do to draw attention to the injustice and need for change. After five years of local activists attempting to promote awareness about the violence, V-Day finally put a spotlight on the incident and made it a global issue. Rojas, although grateful for the global exposure to the incident, believes that V-Day came too late to make much difference and that they were involved for the wrong reasons, i.e., publicity. Rojas also critiques the movement for sidelining the local feminists who were originally attached to this incident and failing to include them in organization or implementation of the march.\n\nAnother critique comes from the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community. In her article \"Queerness, Disability, and The Vagina Monologues”, Kim Hall explained her dissatisfaction with the V-Day movement and more specifically \"The Vagina Monologues\" on an exclusionary basis. Hall believes that the play excludes issues of violence against intersex individuals and perpetuates heterosexism and ableism, or prejudice against people with disabilities. After this critique was published, many performances of \"The Vagina Monologues\" began advocating for the Intersex Society of North America by providing literature at the plays and urging the audience to donate.\n\n\n"}
