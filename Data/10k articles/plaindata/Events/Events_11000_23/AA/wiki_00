However, despite their military successes and an alleged alliance with the former ruling General People's Congress, the Houthis faced widespread domestic and international opposition to the coup and they assented to United Nations–led talks on a power-sharing deal. At least one analyst went so far as to suggest the Houthis' declaration \"fizzled\" in the days after it was announced, although they have Iran's material support and Ali Abdullah Saleh's political support.\n\nOn 21 February 2015, one month after Houthi militants confined him to his residence in Sana'a, Hadi slipped out of the capital and traveled to Aden, the old capital of South Yemen. In a televised address from his hometown, he declared that the Houthi takeover was illegitimate and indicated he remained the constitutional president of Yemen. Hadi's ex-ministers were released by the Houthis on 16 March as a \"goodwill gesture\". On 21 March, Hadi officially proclaimed Aden to be the temporary capital of Yemen, until his pledged recapture of Sana'a. Within days, however, a Houthi-led military campaign wrested much of southern Yemen from Hadi's loyalists, prompting Hadi to flee his presidential palace in Aden and Saudi Arabia to launch airstrikes against Houthi positions throughout the country.\n\nThe Houthis took control of much of northern Yemen by mid-2014. After President Hadi announced an unpopular cut to fuel subsidies, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi called for demonstrations. In September 2014, the protests gave way to full-blown fighting between Houthi militants and army forces loyal to General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar in the capital city of Sana'a. The Houthis achieved a swift victory, forcing the government to the bargaining table. In addition to rolling back the fuel subsidy cuts, they also obtained the resignation of Prime Minister Mohammed Basindawa and significant control over the formation of a new \"unity government\" and constitution-drafting process.\n\nIn January 2015, Houthi forces assaulted the presidential palace and private residence of Hadi, placing the president and his ministers under virtual house arrest while demanding further concessions. Hadi and his cabinet resigned on 22 January. Three weeks later, on 6 February, the Houthis declared the House of Representatives defunct and named a Revolutionary Committee led by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi as the acting authority in Yemen.\n\nUN envoy Jamal Benomar mediated talks between the Houthis and other major factions in Yemen after the \"constitutional declaration\". However, the talks were hampered after delegates from the Nasserist Unionist People's Organisation and Al-Islah reportedly walked out, claiming they were threatened by a Houthi representative. Benomar announced a tentative agreement on 20 February that included the continuation of the House of Representatives and the formation of a \"people's transitional council\" that would represent southerners, women, youth, and other minority groups.\n\nOn 28 February, the Southern Movement pulled out of negotiations on a political solution to the crisis. Hadi suggested moving the talks to Riyadh, the Saudi Arabian capital, instead of continuing to hold them in Houthi-controlled Sana'a. However, the Houthis and GPC rejected the idea. After Hadi refused to participate in the UN talks while the Houthis held Sana'a on 4 March, Houthi fighters seized the headquarters of the National Dialogue Conference, which Hadi had ordered to relocate to Aden.\n\nOn 16 February, former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh's General People's Congress (GPC) said it would accept the Houthi decree dissolving parliament. The same day, Benomar and Nadia Al-Sakkafreportedly visited Hadi, still under house arrest in Sana'a. Hadi escaped Sana'a and fled to Aden five days later.\n\nOn 22 February, the Houthis ordered ex-Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and the cabinet to return to work, but they refused. The group threatened to place them under arrest and criminally charge them if they did not change their minds. The Houthis also reportedly tried without success to get the House of Representatives to meet and formally approve Hadi's resignation. The GPC said it would not call for a vote on the resignation, while some smaller parties asserted that without parliamentary action, Hadi remained the \"constitutional elected president\". The Houthis called Hadi a \"fugitive from justice\" and said he had \"lost his legitimacy to act as president\". Both the Houthis and the GPC said they rejected Hadi's claim to be the legitimate president, despite a letter he sent to parliament formally rescinding his resignation. On 10 March, Ali Abdullah Saleh, the chairman of the General People's Congress, harshly criticised Hadi at a news conference in Sana'a. Saleh accused Hadi, his former vice president, of destroying the country and urged him to go into exile.\n\nMahmoud al-Subaihi, Yemen's defence minister, escaped from house arrest in Sana'a and traveled to Aden in early March. Bahah and his ministers were eventually released in a \"goodwill gesture\" on 16 March, although Bahah said he would not resume his post as prime minister.\n\nA number of members of the dissolved parliament met in Aden on 15 February and declared it to be Yemen's new capital due to the \"occupation\" of Sana'a. They also called on the Gulf Cooperation Council to intervene with force against the Houthis. The leaders of the Aden, Lahij, and Mahrah governorates declared a joint \"administrative, security, and political leadership\" opposing the Houthi takeover. Fighters under the command of Hadi's brother Nasser claimed to have seized Aden's TV station and several government buildings in the port city by 16 February, although Governor Abdel-Aziz bin Habtour denied the station had been taken over.\n\nHadi, the former president, reportedly traveled to Aden on 21 February. It was not immediately clear whether he evaded house arrest or was allowed to leave for the first time in a month, with some reports indicating that he escaped—in one telling, he disguised himself as a woman and stowed away on a food truck, while in another, he was freed by special forces—and others suggesting he was released as part of an agreement between the Houthis and other factions. Upon arriving in Aden, Hadi gave a televised address condemning the coup and saying all Houthi actions since 21 September 2014 were invalid and unconstitutional. He delivered the address under the title of president. In his speech, Hadi called for a resumption of the National Dialogue Conference in either Aden or Taiz, cities outside the Houthis' zone of control. The following day, he met with several southern governors. Bin Habtour said after the meeting that Hadi's intention was to \"lead from Aden\" and receive foreign delegations. An aide to Hadi said in early March that Hadi considered Aden to have become the country's capital after the Houthis occupied Sana'a. Hadi was soon joined by Defence Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi, who abandoned his position as chairman of the Houthi-imposed Supreme Security Committee and decamped from Sana'a.\n\nAlthough he established himself in Aden, Hadi was suspicious of Ali Abdullah Saleh loyalists and Houthi sympathisers even within his hometown. He issued a decree on 2 March reassigning General Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf from the Special Security Forces in Aden to a bureaucratic position. However, al-Saqqaf refused to comply with the decree, amid reports that he did not view Hadi as Yemen's legitimate president.\n\nAfter an attack on Aden International Airport by al-Saqqaf's commandos, as well as a missile strike by a Houthi jet on his presidential palace, on 19 March, Hadi gave a televised address urging all factions to participate in mediated talks on the country's future in Riyadh and predicting that the Houthis' \"Iranian agenda\" would fail. On 21 March, he also officially declared Aden to be Yemen's \"economic and temporary capital\" due to the Houthi occupation of Sana'a, which he pledged would be retaken. Just days later, however, Hadi fled Aden as Houthi forces advanced on the city on 25 March. He arrived in Saudi Arabia the next day.\n\nThere were clashes in Rada'a leaving nine dead on 10 February after Houthi fighters attempted to take control of the city and encountered local resistance. Twenty-six were killed in clashes between Houthis and al Qaeda-aligned Sunni tribesmen in the southern Al Bayda' Governorate on 14 February. The jihadist group Ansar al-Sharia also took advantage of the power vacuum, capturing a military base in the Shabwah Governorate of southern Yemen.\n\nThe Houthis clashed again with tribesmen in Al Bayda' after demonstrations in support of Hadi in several cities on 27 February. Three separate al-Qaeda attacks in Al Bayda' Governorate left at least 27 Houthis dead and more injured on 3 March.\n\nOn 9 March, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) seized control of Al Mahfad in southern Yemen's Abyan Governorate for several hours. A counterattack by the army later that day forced them out of the town. Four soldiers and seven al Qaeda militants were reportedly killed in the fighting. AQAP seized the Al Hawtah District on 20 March, again just for a single day, but 29 soldiers were left dead in a mass killing while the city was under jihadist control. A branch of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant later claimed responsibility for the massacre.\n\nAmid tension between the Houthis and several military commanders, Houthi fighters attacked the residence of General Mohammed Rajah Laboudha in Sana'a on 17 March, reportedly killing one guard and detaining two others.\n\nMajor fighting in Aden broke out on 19 March, leaving more than a dozen dead, after pro-Saleh troops stormed Aden International Airport. Hadi loyalists counterattacked, retaking the airport and capturing the base of a rebel general in the city.\n\nAbdel-Karim al-Kheiwan, a Houthi leader, was shot dead in Sana'a on 18 March 2015. Al Qaeda said it carried out the assassination. Two days later, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility for four suicide attacks against Shia mosques with primarily Houthi congregations in Sana'a. At least 142 people were killed.\n\nAfter the Rada'a clashes on 10 February, the following day, anti-Houthi activists held major protests in Ta'izz and other cities. Houthi fighters fired on protesters in Ibb on 14 February, leaving four injured, and again on 21 February, killing an activist.\n\nAfter Hadi's flight from Sana'a to Aden, thousands protested in support of the deposed president in the capital city on 22 February. A similar demonstration occurred in Ta'izz. Secessionists also rallied in Aden to oppose Hadi's call for unity and national dialogue, chanting that Hadi was \"contemptible\" for not backing southern independence.\n\nAbdul-Malik al-Houthi called for \"protests and demonstrations\" against what he alleged was foreign interference on the part of Saudi Arabia and the United States on 26 February. On 10 March, thousands reportedly protested in Sana'a calling for Ahmed Saleh, son of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, to be nominated to the presidency. A similar demonstration was held on 13 March, after pro-Saleh vehicles with loudspeakers reportedly broadcast messages throughout Sana'a urging residents to come out in support of Ahmed Saleh for the preceding two days.\n\nInternational reactions to the Houthi takeover were generally negative, with the Gulf Cooperation Council, Arab League, European Union, United States, and United Nations all criticising the coup. The United States and United Kingdom moved swiftly to close their embassies and evacuate their ambassadors. France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates followed suit.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution deploring the Houthi takeover and demanding that the group relinquish control of the government on 15 February 2015, although it stopped short of authorising military force. The GCC warned that if the UN did not act forcefully, its members would \"take measures which enable them to maintain their vital interests in the security and stability of Yemen\".\n\nA Saudi delegation met with Hadi on 23 February, days after his escape to Aden. Aides to Hadi said the delegation informed him that Riyadh continued to recognise him as president. The GCC also called on the Yemeni people to support Hadi against the Houthis. Hadi also met with a GCC delegation, including Secretary-General Abdulatif al-Zayani. On 26 February, the Saudi ambassador to Yemen relocated his mission from Sana'a to Aden. Abdul-Malik al-Houthi responded by accusing Saudi Arabia of destabilising the country and financing those who \"aim to hurt the people of Yemen\". Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait also announced they would relocate their embassies to Aden. On 10 March, al-Houthi claimed the Gulf states were working \"to facilitate the atmosphere for al Qaeda in the southern provinces\".\n\nThe United States reportedly withdrew the last of its special forces from Yemen in March 2015. The United Kingdom followed suit, with its remaining troops being airlifted out of Sana'a.\n\nThe government of Iran praised the Houthi uprising as an extension of the Iranian Revolution, with President Hassan Rouhani stating that the Islamic Republic was supporting \"peace and stability\" in Yemen. On 28 February, Houthi-controlled state media announced that Iran and Yemen signed an agreement to open direct flight routes between the two countries. The following month, a Houthi spokesperson said the group had secured pledges from Iran to provide oil to Yemen, expand its ports, and construct power plants in the country.\n\nAfter Riad Yassin, Hadi's foreign minister, called on the Gulf Cooperation Council to assist the beleaguered government in Aden, Saudi Arabia began a military buildup on its border with Yemen in late March 2015, according to US intelligence. On 25 March, Saudi Arabia began launching airstrikes in Yemen.\nYemeni Houthi rebels asks UN to stop Saudi Arabian strikes against them follow continued blatant aggression on Yemen by Saudi.\n\nAccording to Michael G. Vickers, U.S. Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, the United States established an intelligence relationship with the Houthis to counter Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The U.S. ambassador to Yemen, Matthew H. Tueller, met with Hadi after his escape to Aden and said the U.S. still viewed him as the \"legitimate\" president despite the Houthi takeover. However, the U.S. said it had no plans to relocate its shuttered embassy from Sana'a.\n\nAfter the Battle of Aden Airport and Sana'a mosque bombings, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee declared on 21 March a \"state of general mobilisation\", in light of the actions of the pro-Hadi Popular Committees and \"terrorist elements\".\n\nOn 22 March, the Houthis seized Taiz without resistance, although Houthi gunmen reportedly fired into the air to disperse protests against their takeover. The group took control of the military airbase in the city and reportedly flew troops and materiel into the airfield. The Houthi advance was assisted by forces loyal to Saleh. The next day, Houthi forces were dispatched to Mocha, a major port on the Bab-el-Mandeb strait.\n\nThe Houthi offensive advanced dramatically on 25 March, with the systematic falls of Al Anad Air Base, Lahij, and Aden International Airport and the reported capture of Defence Minister Mahmoud al-Subaihi by Houthi fighters. Amid disputed reports that Hadi fled the country, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riad Yassin called on Arab states to intervene in the country's crisis.\n\nShuqrah on the Arabian Sea, east of Aden, fell to the Houthis on 27 March, giving the militants control of all land entrances to Aden. Fighting was reported on the outskirts of the provisional capital itself. By the start of April, Houthi and allied military forces had pressed into central Aden, taking control of the presidential palace on 2 April.\n\nLater that day, the Gulf states made a joint announcement that they would mount a military intervention against the Houthis, al Qaeda, and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Yemen. Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States announced the kingdom launched airstrikes against Houthi targets overnight. Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Sudan also joined the campaign, with Egyptian naval ships moving to block the Bab-el-Mandeb strait, and the United States declared it would provide intelligence and logistical support.\n\nHadi arrived in Riyadh on 26 March, reportedly by way of Oman. He was greeted by the Saudi defence minister, Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud.\n\n"}

{"id": "2839176", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2839176", "title": "Bannawag", "text": "Bannawag\n\nBannawag (Iloko word meaning \"dawn\") is a Philippine weekly magazine published in the Philippines by Liwayway Publications Inc. It contains serialized novels/comics, short stories, poetry, essays, news features, entertainment news and articles, among others, that are written in Ilokano, a language common in the northern regions of the Philippines.\n\n\"Bannawag\" has been acknowledged as one foundation of the existence of contemporary Iloko literature. It is through the \"Bannawag\" that every Ilokano writer has proved his mettle by publishing his first Iloko short story, poetry, or essay, and thereafter his succeeding works, in its pages. The magazine is also instrumental in the establishment of GUMIL Filipinas, the umbrella organization of Ilokano writers in the Philippines and in other countries.\n\nBannawag magazine was conceived in 1934 when Magdaleno A. Abaya of Candon, Ilocos Sur, who was then a member of the editorial staff of the Graphic magazine, an English weekly published by the Roces Publications, presented the concept of an Ilokano publication to the management of the Graphic magazine. Don Ramos Roces, the owner-publisher of Graphic magazine and other vernacular magazines which included Liwayway, Bisaya and Hiligaynon, scoffed at the idea when Abaya presented the proposal to put a magazine for Ilocanos.\n\nBut Abaya did not lose hope until Don Ramos gave his consent-with condition that the first issues were only for a try-out, that after one or two months without improvement in the sales, it will be stopped. Abaya was elated and hurried to find willing companions to help him run the magazine. In the end, he was able to persuade Mauro Peña to be the magazine's assistant and news editor, Francisco Fuentecilla of Zambales as assistant and news editor,; and Benjamin Gray, also of Candon, Ilocos Sur, as proofreader. Thus, Bannawag or \"Dawn,\" or the Iloko equivalent of Liwayway, was born.\n\nBannawag's first issue on November 3, 1934 had a production run of 10,000 copies with a selling price of PHP 0.10 per copy. The magazine was an instant success beyond the belief of Don Ramon, and he allowed the continued publication of the magazine.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops to fought by the Japanese Imperial forces led by General Tomoyuki Yamashita around the fall the battles started the liberation in Northern Luzon in 1945.\n\nWhen Roces Publications was sold to Hans M. Menzi in 1966, the name was changed to Liwayway Publishing, Inc. Thirty nine years later, in 2005, the publication of Bannawag was transferred to Manila Bulletin Publishing Corporation. Clesencio B. Rambaud, Prudencio Gar. Padios and Juan Al. Asuncion were tasked to man Bannawag. However, Padios migrated to Canada in October 2006 and Ariel S. Tabag of Sta. Teresita, Cagayan was recruited to fill in the vacancy,\n\n\"Bannawag\" underwent significant metamorphosis when its publication when taken over by the Manila Bulletin, from its content, color, quality of paper used, page layout, and other aspects to keep up with the needs of the times. These changes made the magazine more prestigious in its tasks in bringing entertainment, information, and inspiration to millions of readers in the language spoken by hardly Ilocanos and in depicting the different aspects of the Ilocano character.\n\nRecently, it was picked up by the department of education as one of the important references of the educational system in Ilocano-speaking areas in the country.\n\n\"Bannawag\" has gone a long way from its 10-centavo cost for each edition in the 1930s and is moving vigorously to live up the past as an important part of today and tomorrow's dream of the Ilocanos.\n\n\"Bannawag\" celebrated its diamond jubilee on November 3, 2009. In celebration of this, \"Bannawag\" launched the planting of Bannawag Diamond Jubilee trees in municipal parks and lots, school sites, and other public spaces. Jim Domingo, a retired professor and university official of Cagayan State University, was instrumental in the planting.\n\n"}
{"id": "4701633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4701633", "title": "Bụi đời", "text": "Bụi đời\n\nThe Vietnamese term bụi đời (\"dust of life\") refers to vagrants in the city, or, trẻ bụi đời to street children or juvenile gangs. From 1989, following a song in the musical \"Miss Saigon\", \"Bui-Doi\" came to popularly refer to Amerasian children left behind in Vietnam after the Vietnam War.\n\nThe term \"bụi đời\" (\"dust of life\") originally referred to the starving people of the countryside taking refuge in towns, in the 1930s. The term \"trẻ bụi đời\" \"young vagrants,\" now refers to street children or juvenile gang members. It is intended to bring to mind an image of a child abandoned and moving about without purpose, like dust. In Vietnamese, it has no racial connotation. Vietnamese refer to Amerasians as \"Mỹ lai\" (mixed American and Vietnamese), \"con lai\" (mixed-race child), or \"người lai\" (mixed-race person).\n\nThe connection to mixed-race parentage given in Western media, from connection with \"Miss Saigon\", is not widely known in Vietnam today. The term \"bụi đời\" in Vietnam today refers to any people, but usually young men, who live on the street or live as wanderers. A related verb \"đi bụi\" (\"go dust\") means someone who has left their home, usually due to arguments with their family, to take on the \"bụi đời\" wandering or street life.\n\nIn the West, the term Bui-Doi became widely known from the use in the dialogue, and particularly the song title \"Bui-Doi\", of the 1989 musical \"Miss Saigon\" by Claude-Michel Schönberg and Alain Boublil, which opened in 1991 on Broadway, and, until its closing in 2001, was the eleventh longest running Broadway musical in musical theater history. The song \"Bui-Doi\" had lyrics written by Alain Boublil and Richard Maltby, Jr. They took the term \"bụi đời\" to mean not Vietnamese street children, but the Amerasian offspring of American soldiers and Vietnamese mothers abandoned at the end of the Vietnam War.\n\nThe majority of mixed race people after the Vietnam war were Amerasians or children of Vietnamese mothers and military or civilian men from the United States. Amerasians born during the Vietnam War (1964–75) could be the issue of anything from long-term unions to rape. Due to the large sex industry brought on by the military economy, Amerasians were predominantly seen as off-spring of GI fathers and prostitute mothers. Life was frequently difficult for such Amerasians; they existed as pariahs in Vietnamese society. Often, they would be persecuted by the communist government and sometimes even sold into prostitution as children. Under the Amerasian Homecoming Act of 1988, a Vietnamese Amerasian could obtain a U.S. visa on the basis of appearance alone. Amerasians gained the attention of con artists who claimed to be their relatives in the hope of obtaining visas. About 23,000 Amerasians immigrated to the U.S. under this act.\n\nIn the United States, \"bui doi\", or the term \"dust of life\", again referred to the criminal class, where the youths included newly transplanted Vietnamese and Amerasians. The misuse of the word \"bui doi\" also migrated to the United States and was appropriated by the mainstream.\n\nThe 1977 made-for-TV movie \"Green Eyes\" was a fictional movie about an American veteran who makes a trip back to Southeast Asia to search for his son from a liaison with a Vietnamese woman. He encounters a boy with green eyes who insists that he must be half American and thus eligible to go to America.\n\nThe 1994 documentary film \"Bui doi: Life Like Dust\" uses the term to describe Ricky Phan, a Vietnamese refugee who turned to a life of crime after escaping from Vietnam to California.\n\nThe 2004 movie \"The Beautiful Country\" depicts the life of a fictional \"bui doi\" and his efforts to become reunited with his American father. The prologue to The Beautiful Country opens with a definition: \"Bui Doi: 'less than dust' Term used to describe Vietnamese children with American fathers.\"\n\nThe 2014 movie \"Noble\", a true life story of Christina Noble, who overcomes the harsh difficulties of her childhood in Ireland to find her calling by helping the bụi đời on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "6323556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6323556", "title": "Cat organ", "text": "Cat organ\n\nA cat organ or cat piano ( or \"Katzenklavier\", or \"piano à chats/piano chats\") is a hypothetical musical instrument which consists of a line of cats fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a keyboard so that they cry out when a key is pressed. The cats would be arranged according to the natural tone of their voices.\n\nThere is no official record of a cat organ actually being built; rather it is described in literature as a bizarre concept. \"The details of the cat organ present it clearly as an instrument cat lovers might wish was a fictional horror.\" The instrument is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty while the piganino, a similar instrument using pigs, has been used to criticize the poor.\n\nThis instrument was described by the French writer Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin in his book \"Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre\" (Musiciana, descriptions of rare or bizarre inventions):\n\nThe instrument was described by German physician Johann Christian Reil (1759–1813) for the purpose of treating patients who had lost the ability to focus their attention. Reil believed that if they were forced to see and listen to this instrument, it would inevitably capture their attention and they would be cured: \"A fugue played on this instrument--when the ill person is so placed that he cannot miss the expression on their faces and the play of these animals--must bring Lot's wife herself from her fixed state into conscious awareness.\"\n\nThe instrument was first described by Athanasius Kircher in his 1650 work \"Musurgia Universalis\", though the lack of an image may have left doubt in the minds of some writers. (\"The New York Times\", for example, has carried an article claiming he described the instrument, and another stating he did not describe it in \"Musurgia Universalis\".). His description appears in Book 6, Part 4, Chapter 1, under the heading \"Corollaria,\" (emphasis added):\n\nThe citation is noted by Kircher's student Gaspar Schott in \"Magia Naturalis naturae et artis,\" Part 2, Book 6, Pragmatia 2, titled \"Felium Musicam exhibere [Cat Concert].\"\n\nMichael Betancourt compares the sampling of cats' meows used in Jingle Cats' albums, \"Meowy Christmas\" (1993) and \"Here Comes Santa Claws\" (1994), to the cat organ, in that both require cats, but diminish each performer's importance.\n\nKircher notes that the instrument can be used to reduce the melancholy of princes by moving them to laughter, almost exactly the situation that occurred in 2010 when Prince Charles was greatly amused by a performance of the tune \"Over the Rainbow\" on an instrument recreated using squeaky toy cats by Henry Dagg for a garden party held at Clarence House supporting Charles's Start initiative for sustainable living. \n\nIn 2009, The People's Republic of Animation, a professional animation studio, released an animation titled \"The Cat Piano\". This work tells the tale of a city of cats whose musicians are kidnapped by a human in order to make a cat piano. This short film has received several awards, as well as nominations for awards. The Academy announced that it was shortlisted for an Oscar for Best Animated Short. However, it was not nominated.\n\n\n\n"}

This meant that the outcome was in favour of the United Kingdom to leaving the European Union, a decision and process that has commonly referred to as \"Brexit\". Consequently, UK Prime Minister Theresa May triggered Article 50 on 29 March 2017, starting the process of British withdrawal from the European Union.\n\nThe result provoked considerable debate as to the factors that contributed to the victory, with various theories and explanations being put forth. This page provides an overview of the different claims being made.\n\nThe 'Leave' campaign campaigned primarily on issues relating to sovereignty and migration, whereas the remain campaign focused on the economic impacts of leaving the EU. This choice of key positions is significant since Ipsos MORI survey data on which issues Britons felt to be 'important issues facing Britain today' shows that immediately prior to the vote, more people cited both the EU (32%) and migration (48%) as important issues than cited the economy (27%).\n\nOn the day of the referendum Lord Ashcroft's polling team questioned 12,369 people who had completed voting. This poll produced data that showed that 'Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the European Union was “the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK”. The sense that EU membership took decision making further away from 'the people' in favour of domination by regulatory bodies is seen as having been a strong motivating factor for leave voters wanting to end or reverse the process of EU influence in the UK.\n\nImmediately prior to the vote, Ipsos MORI data showed that Europe was the third most highly ranked problem by Britons who were asked to name the most important issues facing the country, with 32% of respondents naming it as an issue.\n\nLord Ashcroft's election day poll of 12,369 voters also discovered that 'One third (33%) [of leave voters] said the main reason was that leaving \"offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.\"'\n\nImmediately prior to the referendum, data from Ipsos-Mori showed that immigration/migration was the most cited issue when Britons were asked 'What do you see as the most/other important issue facing Britain today?', with 48% of respondents mentioning it when surveyed.\n\nIn the decade before the Brexit referendum there was a significant increase in migration from EU countries, as outlined by the Migration Observatory:\n'Inflows of EU nationals migrating to the UK stood at 268,000 in 2014, up from 201,000 in 2013. EU inflows were mainly flat for the 1991–2003 period, averaging close to 61,000 per year.'\n\nAccording to \"The Economist\", areas that saw increases of over 200% in foreign-born population between 2001 and 2014 saw a majority of voters back leave in 94% of cases. The Economist concluded 'High numbers of migrants don’t bother Britons; high rates of change do.' Consistent with that notion, research suggests that areas that saw significant influx of migration from Eastern Europe following the accession of 12 mainly Eastern European countries to the European Union in 2004 saw significant growth in support for UKIP and more likely to vote to leave the European Union. Academic research investigating differences in Brexit vote among local authorities concluded that the Brexit vote was bigger in areas that had seen a large rise in the proportion of immigrants between 2004 and 2011.\n\nGoodwin and Milazzo say that \"in areas where there were previously few migrants, increases in immigration will have a more noticeable effect—and will be more likely to influence political behaviour\" whereas ethnically diverse areas will perceive additional immigration as having little effect. They go on to explain that the non-British population of Boston in Lincolnshire became 16 times larger between 2005 and 2015, rising from 1,000 to 16,000. Boston also had the highest vote in favour of 'leave' in the UK, at just over 75% in favour of leaving the EU, which they believe is due to the effects of immigration seeming sudden and intense. They also argue that their data suggests that if Boston had experienced the UK average level of demographic change then the vote in favour of 'leave' would have been reduced by nearly 15% and they even suggest that areas such as West Lancashire may have had a majority for 'remain' if residents had experienced the average rate of demographic change. Their research demonstrates why it is believed that the issue of immigration strongly affected voters' decisions.\n\nIt has been argued that the result was caused by differential voting patterns among younger and older people. According to Opinium, 64% of eligible people aged 18–24 voted, whereas 90% of eligible individuals over 65 voted. It is argued that older voters were more likely to vote 'leave' due to having experienced life in the UK prior to 1973, when the UK joined the European Economic Community which later became the EU, and this memory as well as any potential nostalgia may have influenced their decision. Furthermore, polls by Ipsos-Mori, YouGov and Lord Ashcroft all assert that 70-75% of under 25s voted remain. Therefore it has been argued that a higher turnout of older people and a lower turnout of younger people affected the overall result of the referendum as the older generation was more in favour of 'leave' than the 'remain' favouring younger voters. Additionally according to YouGov, only 54% of 25-49 year olds voted 'remain', whilst 60% of 50-64 year olds and 64% of over 65s voted 'leave' meaning that the support for 'remain' was not as strong outside the youngest demographic.\n\nAcademic Eric Kaufman notes the relatively strong correlation between a voter's support for the death penalty and their choice to vote 'leave'. He says that this highlights a social division that he calls 'order versus openness'. He further argues that 'The order-openness divide is emerging as the key political cleavage, overshadowing the left-right economic dimension'.\n\nIt is argued that data from the British Election Study suggests that support for the death penalty is an example of how valuing 'order' over 'openness' could have affected voting behaviour in the referendum. Those who valued 'order' were more likely to support the death penalty and vote 'leave' than those who were 'pro-remain' and against the death penalty, which are stances considered to value 'openness' more. \n\nMatthew Goodwin and Rob Ford coined the term 'The Left Behind' to refer to 'older, white, socially conservative voters in more economically marginal neighbourhoods'. Analysing data the day after the Referendum, Ford concluded that 'Such voters had turned against a political class they saw as dominated by socially liberal university graduates with values fundamentally opposed to theirs, on identity, Europe – and particularly immigration.' This was described in as \"if you've got money, you vote in... if you haven't got money, you vote out\". Many other academics have also suggested the link between voting 'leave' and a rejection of neoliberalism and globalisation and the sense of economic insecurity that some members of society have felt as a result of these economic processes. Bateman suggests that today's globalised world has contributed to the feeling of fast-paced changes in society and the economy, leading to the sense of being 'left behind', which she argues motivated some voters to vote 'leave'. In a similar manner to the arguments of Goodwin, Ford and Bateman it has also been suggested that both economically and socially 'left behind' groups \"are united by a general sense of insecurity, pessimism and marginalisation\", increasingly feeling as though liberalised society as well as the UK and European establishments do not represent their interests or share their concerns.\n\nThe left-behind hypothesis is furthered using data on the EU referendum result across electoral wards level as well as across local authorities, suggesting that especially areas with high degrees of social deprivation and low educational attainment strongly voted in favour of leaving the EU.\n\nAcademics James Dennison and Noah Carl argue that 'the most important phenomenon to be explained vis-à-vis the referendum result in our view is that a sizable Eurosceptic faction has remained extant in Britain over the last four decades'. Using data from the Eurobarometer survey they showed that fewer Britons considered themselves European than any other EU nationality. Furthermore, they show that British trading patterns, capital flows and emigration patterns were the least Europeanised of any EU member state.\n\nJohn Curtice says that if voters \"felt that membership of the EU undermined Britain's distinctive identity were more likely to vote for Leave\" and goes on to report that the same was true for voters \"with a weak sense of European identity\". Such research implies that how attached voters felt to either Britain or to the EU influenced their decision, voting in favour of whichever identity they felt more strongly attached to.\n\nFurthermore in terms of integration, Britain had developed a reputation of being \"an awkward partner\" in Europe due to its reluctance to fully embrace European integration, opting-out of the Schengen Area and the euro. It has been suggested that Britain's reservations about European integration, as well as its historical stance of remaining less integrated than other EU states, laid the groundwork for the potential that Britain would decide to exit the bloc.\n\nThe World Economic Forum 2017 acknowledged in its Global Risks Report that \"the Brexit and President-elect Trump victories featured (...) appeals to sovereignty rooted in national identity and pride\" and that it would \"be challenging to find political narratives and policies that can repair decades-long cultural fault-lines\".\n\nMichael Dougan, Professor of European Law at the University of Liverpool, in a viral video of one of his lectures prior to the referendum, described the Leave campaign as peddling \"dishonesty on an industrial scale\". Dougan also said that the Remain campaign had \"made use of dodgy statistics\".\n\nPerhaps the most commonly criticised claim by the Leave campaign was that voting to leave the EU would allow for increased spending on the NHS of £350m a week.\n\nVote Leave claimed that the UK sends £350 million to the EU every week. The Treasury's own statement of the UK's contribution to the EU is that the net amount is £6.27 billion per annum. Divided by 52, this is approximately £120 million per week (net amount). Sir John Major claimed that Vote Leave had deliberately misled voters by using the gross contribution to the EU before the automatically deducted UK Rebate. The gross contribution is the amount the UK would pay under the standard formula before any discounts and rebates. The UK currently gets a 40% discount from the gross contribution which was negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s (worth about £144 million) - but reduced by a new formula agreed by Tony Blair in the early 2000s - plus various agricultural, economic development and scientific research 'rebates' (worth approximately a further £96 million).\n\nElements of the Leave campaign have been identified as exemplifying \"post-truth politics\", in which debate is framed largely by appeals to emotion rather than the details of policy or objective factual analysis.\n\nIt has been argued that the 'Leave' brand was stronger and more effective than the 'Remain' brand. According to Mike Hind, a marketing professional, \"The Britain Stronger In Europe brand was stillborn. On the basis of preparation, presentation and messaging, it deserved the kicking it got.\" Additionally behavioural practitioner Warren Hatter argues that 'Leave' as a word places a lower cognitive load on observers than 'Remain a member of'.\n\nEconomics writer Chris Dillow has argued that, among other factors, Prospect Theory may explain the surprising willingness of many voters to take a path widely viewed as the more risky of two (change vs status quo). In his words Prospect Theory 'Tells us that people who feel they’ve lost want to gamble to break even. This is why they back longshots on the last race of the day or why they hold onto badly performing stocks. People who had lost out from globalization, or felt discomforted by immigration, voted Leave because they felt they had little to lose from doing so.'\n\nDominic Cummings, Campaign Director of Vote Leave wrote in The Spectator in January 2017 on \"how the Brexit referendum was won\".\n\nHe wrote: \"Leave won because 1) three big forces [the immigration crisis, the 2008 financial crisis and the euro crisis] created conditions in which the contest was competitive, AND 2) Vote Leave exploited the situation imperfectly but effectively, AND 3) Cameron/Osborne made big mistakes. If just one of these had been different, it is very likely IN would have won.\" \n\n\"Pundits and MPs kept saying ‘why isn’t Leave arguing about the economy and living standards’. They did not realise that for millions of people, £350m/NHS was about the economy and living standards – that’s why it was so effective. It was clearly the most effective argument not only with the crucial swing fifth but with almost every demographic. Even with UKIP voters it was level-pegging with immigration. Would we have won without immigration? No. Would we have won without £350m/NHS? All our research and the close result strongly suggests No.\"\n\n\"If Boris, Gove, and Gisela had not supported us and picked up the baseball bat marked ‘Turkey/NHS/£350 million’ with five weeks to go, then 650,000 votes might have been lost.\"\n\nIt has been claimed that the role of migration as a key factor in driving voting behaviour at the referendum originates from the relatively high levels of net migration into the UK in the last decade. In particular it is claimed that the decision not to impose restrictions on EU migrants after the addition of the 'A8' (Eastern European) countries to the EU in 2004 (at a time when other European countries did impose such restrictions) contributed to a spike in migration levels that underpins contemporary voter attitudes.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's decision to open her country's borders for more than a million refugees and illegal immigrants was a \"catastrophic mistake\" and \"the final straw that broke the camel's back\", allowing the Leave campaign to win. Whilst campaigning for the Republican Party nomination for the upcoming 2016 U.S. presidential election, Trump already made similar statements prior to the EU referendum and immediately afterwards. For example, at a rally in Ashburn, Virginia, US he also suggested that more countries would leave the EU because of Merkel's decision. \n\nWhilst this is an example of Trump stating his opinion, there is evidence that the migrant crisis played a role in the outcome of the referendum. As already stated in this article immigration concerns were influential in voters' decisions and Goodwin and Milazzo assert that such concerns were \"likely sharpened by the continuation of historically unprecedented levels of net migration and the arrival of a pan-European refugee crisis in 2015\". Therefore, the migration crisis may have influenced the referendum result by intensifying a factor (immigration concerns) that was already seen as a motivation to vote 'leave'. \n\nFurthermore, Nigel Farage and long-term Eurosceptic party UKIP used images from the migrant crisis during their campaign due to the increased immigration anxiety the crisis caused, prompting criticism from some \"Leave\" and \"Remain\" supporters. Leading Leave campaigner Michael Gove said that it was \"the wrong thing to do\", whilst then-Chancellor George Osborne of the Remain side stated that the poster \"had echoes of literature used in the 1930s\" in Germany. Criticism aside, the decision to use the migrant crisis to win votes for 'leave', suggests that the crisis was at the very least seen as something that had the potential to affect the referendum outcome.\n\n\"The Guardian\" journalist Jane Martinson noted that many of the UK's biggest selling newspapers, \"The Sun\" and the \"Daily Mail\" in particular, but also including \"The Daily Telegraph\" and \"Daily Express\", have been Eurosceptic for many years. The implication of this is that the political stance of the print media could have shaped the public's opinion before the referendum.\n\nThe BBC was also criticised by many remain-supporting pundits for false balance which helped give the leave campaign credibility. Leading up to and during the EU referendum campaign, \"Daily Mail, the Daily Telegraph, Daily Express\" and \"The Sun\" were all pro-Leave. Curtice argues that as these were \"more popular\" newspapers, their support not only provided credibility to the Leave campaign but also meant that there would be \"sympathetic coverage\" for its pro-Brexit arguments.\n\nSeaton explains that long-term anti-EU reporting, demonisation of foreign nationals and the working class in mainstream media could have made the public more susceptible to pro-Brexit arguments, as well as having \"shaped the debate\". Seaton also comments on the effect of social media on the referendum, which played a much more prominent role in the campaign and the vote than in previous votes in the UK. Seaton argues that social media was highly influential in shaping voters' opinions as social media enables users to \"get more of what you like\" whilst being able to \"avoid exposure to what you disagree with\" on a platform that is \"driven by popularity\".\n\n"}

It will also demonstrate low-thrust trajectory control techniques, such as multiple lunar flybys, within the Earth-Moon region using water steam as propellant. The spacecraft was designed and developed jointly by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and the University of Tokyo.\n\n\"EQUULEUS\" will be one of thirteen CubeSats to be carried with the Orion EM-1 mission into a heliocentric orbit in cislunar space on the maiden flight of the Space Launch System, scheduled to launch in December 2019.\n\nMapping the plasmasphere around Earth may provide important insight for protecting both humans and electronics from radiation damage during long space journeys. It will also demonstrate low-thrust trajectory control techniques, such as multiple lunar flybys, within the Earth-Moon Lagrangian points (EML). The mission will demonstrate that departing from EML can transfer to various orbits, such as Earth orbits, Moon orbits, and interplanetary orbits, with a tiny amount of orbital control. \"EQUULEUS\" features 2 deployable solar panels, and lithium batteries.\n\nThe mission will be monitored from the Japanese deep space antenna (64-meter antenna and 34-meter antenna) with support from the DSN (Deep Space Network) of JPL. The Principal investigator is Professor Hashimoto at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA). The mission is named after the 'little horse' constellation Equuleus.\n\nThe propulsion system, called \"AQUARIUS\", employs 8 water thrusters also used for attitude control (orientation) and momentum management. The spacecraft will carry 1.5 kg of water, and the complete propulsion system will occupy about 2.5 units out of the 6 units total spacecraft volume. The waste heat from the communication components is reused to assist in the heating of water vapor, which is heated to at the pre-heater. The AQUARIUS' water thrusters produce a total of 4.0 mN, a specific impulse (I) of 70 s, and consumes about 20 W power.\n\n\"EQUULEUS\" scientific payload features a small UV telescope named PHOENIX (Plasmaspheric Helium ion Observation by Enhanced New Imager in eXtreme ultraviolet) that will operate in the high-energy extreme ultraviolet wavelengths. It consists of an entrance mirror of 60 mm diamemeter, and a photon counting device. The reflectivity of the mirror is optimized for the emission line of helium ion (30.4 nm wavelength), which is the relevant component of the Earth's plasmasphere. The plasmasphere is where various phenomena are caused by the electromagnetic disturbances by the solar wind. By flying far from the Earth, the PHOENIX telescope will provide a global image of the Earth's plasmasphere and contribute to its spatial and temporal evolution.\n\nDELPHINUS (DEtection camera for Lunar impact PHenomena IN 6U Spacecraft), or DLP, for short is a camera connected to the PHOENIX telescope to observe lunar impact flashes and near-Earth asteroids, as well as potential 'mini-moons' while positioned at the Earth-Moon Lagrangian point L2 (EML2) halo orbit. Theoretically, NEOs approaching Earth can be briefly caught within Earth's gravity well, and although in terms of orbital mechanics the object's movements is still centered around the sun, to an observer on Earth it will move as if it is a moon of the planet. One example of such an object is 2006 RH120, which orbited Earth between 2006 and 2007. If a mini-moon or NEO that can be rendezvoused by EQUULEUS is identified, the CubeSat will attempt a flyby. This payload occupies about 0.5 units out of the total 6 units volume. The results will contribute to the risk evaluation for future infrastructure or human activity on the lunar surface.\n\nThe instrument named CLOTH (Cis-Lunar Object Detector within Thermal Insulation) will detect and evaluate the meteoroid impact flux in the cislunar space by using dust detectors mounted on the exterior of the spacecraft. The goal of this instrument is to understand the size and spatial distribution of dust solid objects in the cislunar space. CLOTH utilizes the spacecraft's multi-layer insulation (MLI) as a detector, thus realizing a dust counter suitable for mass-constrained CubeSats. It will be the first instrument to measure the dust environment of the Earth–Moon L Lagrangian point, and aims to uncover the dust's origin, as well as conducting risk assessment of the point dust particles in anticipation of a future manned mission. CLOTH will decipher point dust (likely originating from mini-moons) from sporadic dust by differences in their impact velocity.\n\n\n"}

It is given by the formula:\nwhere\n\nformula_7\n\nThis formula was derived in 1757, by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler. The column will remain straight for loads less than the critical load. The \"critical load\" is the greatest load that will not cause lateral deflection (buckling). For loads greater than the critical load, the column will deflect laterally. The critical load puts the column in a state of unstable equilibrium. A load beyond the critical load causes the column to fail by buckling. As the load is increased beyond the critical load the lateral deflections increase, until it may fail in other modes such as yielding of the material. Loading of columns beyond the critical load are not addressed in this article.\n\nAround 1900, J. B. Johnson showed that at low slenderness ratios an alternative formula should be used.\n\nThe following assumptions are made while deriving Euler’s formula:\n\nFor slender columns, critical stress is usually lower than yield stress, and in the elastic range. A stocky column would, on the contrast, have a critical buckling stress higher than the yield, i.e. it yields in shortening prior the virtual elastic buckling onset.\nWhere:\n\nformula_11 - Slenderness ratio\n\nformula_12 - The effective length, formula_13\n\nformula_14 - Radius of gyration, formula_15\n\nformula_4 - Moment of inertia\n\nformula_17 - Area cross section\n\nThe following model applies to columns simply supported at each end (formula_18).\n\nFirstly, we will put attention to the fact there are no reactions in the hinged ends, so we also have no shear force in any cross-section of the column. The reason for no reactions can be obtained from symmetry (so the reactions should be in the same direction) and from moment equilibrium (so the reactions should be in opposite directions).\n\nUsing the free body diagram in the right side of figure 3, and making a summation of moments about point A:\n\nformula_19\n\nwhere w is the lateral deflection.\n\nAccording to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, the deflection of a beam is related with its bending moment by:\n\nso:\n\nformula_21\n\nLet formula_22, so:\n\nformula_23\n\nWe get a classical homogeneous second-order ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe general solutions of this equation is: formula_24, where formula_25 and formula_26 are constants to be determined by boundary conditions, which are:\n\nIf formula_29, no bending moment exists and we get the trivial solution of formula_30.\n\nHowever, from the other solution formula_31 we get formula_32, for formula_33\n\nTogether with formula_22 as defined before, the various critical loads are:\n\nformula_35, for formula_33\n\nand depending upon the value of formula_37, different buckling modes are produced as shown in figure 4. The load and mode for n=0 is the nonbuckled mode.\n\nTheoretically, any buckling mode is possible, but in the case of a slowly applied load only the first modal shape is likely to be produced.\n\nThe critical load of Euler for a pin ended column is therefore: formula_38\n\nand the obtained shape of the buckled column in the first mode is: formula_39.\n\nThe differential equation of the axis of a beam is:\n\nformula_40\n\nFor a column with axial load only, the lateral load formula_41 vanishes and substituting formula_22 , we get:\n\nformula_43\n\nThis is a homogeneous fourth-order differential equation and its general solution is formula_44\n\nThe four constants formula_45 are determined by the boundary conditions (end constraints) on formula_46, at each end. There are three cases:\nUsing each time a different combination of these BCs, eigenvalue problems are obtained. Solving those, we get the values of Euler's critical load for each one of the cases presented in Figure 1.\n\n"}

{"id": "10061279", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10061279", "title": "Event chain methodology", "text": "Event chain methodology\n\nEvent chain methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule network analysis technique that is focused on identifying and managing events and relationship between them (event chains) that affect project schedules. Event chain methodology is an extension of quantitative project risk analysis with Monte Carlo simulations. It is the next advance beyond critical path method and critical chain project management. Event chain methodology helps to mitigate the effect of motivational and cognitive biases in estimating and scheduling. It improves accuracy of risk assessment and helps to generate more realistic risk adjusted project schedules.\n\nEvent chain methodology is an extension of traditional Monte Carlo simulation of project schedules where uncertainties in task duration and costs are defined by statistical distribution. For example, task duration can be defined by three point estimates: low, base, and high. The results of analysis is a risk adjusted project schedule, crucial tasks, and probabilities that project will be completed on time and on budget. Defining uncertainties using statistical distribution provide accurate results if there is a reliable historical data about duration and cost of similar tasks in previous projects. Another approach is to define uncertainties using risk events or risk drivers, which can be assigned to different tasks or resources. Information about probabilities and impact of such events is easier to elicit, which improves accuracy of analysis. Risks can be recorded in the Risk register. Event chain methodology was first proposed in the period of 2002-2004. It is fully or partially implemented in a number of software application. Event Chain Methodology is based on six principles and has a number of outcomes.\n\nActivities (tasks) are not a continuous uniform procedure. Tasks are affected by external events, which transform an activity from one state to another. One of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity. This moment, when an event occurs, in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using statistical distribution. The original state is called a ground state, other states are called excited states. For example, if the team completes their job on activity, they can move to other activities. The notion of an activity's state is important because certain events can or cannot occur when activity is in certain state. It means that the state of an activity is subscribed to the events. Events can be local, affecting particular tasks or resources, or global affecting all tasks or resources.\n\nEvents can be related to other events, which will create event chains. These event chains can significantly affect the course of the project. \nFor example, requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed. To accelerate the activity, the project manager allocates a resource from another activity, which then leads to a missed deadline. Eventually, this can lead to the failure of the project. It could be different relationship between events. One event can trigger one or multiple events.\n\nEvents can be correlated with each other without one triggering another one. In this case if one risk has occurred, another one will occur and vice versa. One event assigned in one activity can execute another activity or group of activities. In many cases it the execution of risk response plans. For example, event “structural defect is discovered” can cause one or many activities “Repair”. Events can cause other events to occur either immediately or with a delay. The delay is a property of the event subscription. The delay can be deterministic, but in most cases, it is probabilistic. Also risks can be transferred from one activity to another. To define event chains, we need to identify a \"sender\", the event that initiates the chain of events. The sender event can cause one or more events that effect multiple activities. These are called \"receiver\" events. In turn, the receiver events can also act as sender events.\n\nEvent chain diagram is a visualization that shows the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other. The simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the Gantt chart. Here are a few important rules:\n\nBy using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains, the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified.\nAnother tool that can be used to simplify the definition of events is a state table. Columns in the state table represent events; rows represent the states of an activity. Information for each event in each state includes four properties of event subscription: probability, moment of event, excited state, and impact of the event.\n\nOnce events and event chains are defined, quantitative analysis using Monte Carlo simulation can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events. Probabilities and impacts of risks assigned to activities are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the project schedule. In most projects it is necessary to supplement the event based variance with uncertainties as distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.\n\nIn Event chain methodology, risk can not only affect schedule and cost, but also other parameters such as safety, security, performance, technology, quality, and other objectives. In other words one event can belong to different categories. The result of the analysis would show risk exposure for different categories as well as integrated project risk score for all categories. This integrated project risk score is calculated based on relative weights for each risk category.\n\nMonte Carlo simulation provides the capability, through sensitivity analysis, to identify single or chains of events. These chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters, such as project duration or cost, and the event chains. These are called “critical events” or “critical chains of events”. By identifying critical events or critical chains of events, we can identify strategies to minimize their negative effects: Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, or Accept. Event and event chain ranking is performed for all risk categories (schedule-related and non-schedule) as part of one process. Integrated risk probability, impact and score can be calculated using weights for each risk category.\n\nMonitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis. During the course of the project, the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data. The main reason for performance tracking is forecasting an activity’s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity. Event chain methodology reduces the risk probability and impact automatically based on the percent of work completed. Advanced analysis can be performed using a Bayesian approach. It is possible to monitor the chance that a project will meet a specific deadline. This chance is constantly updated as a result of the Monte Carlo analysis. Critical events and event chains can be different at the various phases of the project\n\nSometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed. This is a very common scenario for real life projects; sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity. Event chain methodology simplifies modeling of these scenarios The original project schedule does not need to be updated, all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity. In addition, a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated must be defined.\n\nIf an event or event chain occurs during the course of a project, it may require some risk response effort. \nRisk response plans execution are triggered by events, which occur if an activity is in an excited state. Risk response events may attempt to transform the activity from the excited state to the ground state. Response plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the response plan to an event or event chain. The same response plan can be used for one or more events.\n\nOne potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another, which can occur under certain conditions. For example, if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period, this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity. Reallocation \nof resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value. Events can be used to model different situations with resources, e.g. temporary leave, illness, vacations, etc.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47412303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47412303", "title": "Expiration date", "text": "Expiration date\n\nAn expiration date or expiry date is a previously determined date after which something should no longer be used, either by operation of law or by exceeding the anticipated shelf life for perishable goods. Expiration dates are applied to selected food products and to some other manufactured products like infant car seats where the age of the product may impact its safe use.\n\nArbitrary expiration dates are also commonly applied by companies to product coupons, promotional offers and credit cards. In these contexts, the expiration date is chosen for business reasons or to provide some security function rather than any product safety concern. \n\nExpiration date is often abbreviated EXP or ED. The legal definition and usage of the term expiration date will vary between countries and products.\n\n\"Best before\" or \"best by\" dates appear on a wide range of frozen, dried, tinned and other foods. These dates are only advisory and refer to the quality of the product, in contrast with \"use by\" dates, which indicate that the product may no longer be safe to consume after the specified date. Food kept after the \"best before\" date will not necessarily be harmful, but may begin to lose its optimum flavour and texture. Eggs are a special case, since they may contain salmonella which multiplies over time; they should therefore be eaten before the \"best before\" date, which is, in the USA, a maximum of 45 days after the eggs are packed.\n\nSometimes the packaging process involves using pre-printed labels, making it impractical to write the \"best before\" date in a clearly visible location. In this case, wording like \"best before see bottom\" or \"best before see lid\" might be printed on the label and the date marked in a different location as indicated.\n\nGenerally, foods that have a \"use by\" date written on the packaging must not be eaten after the specified date. This is because such foods usually go bad quickly and may be injurious to health if spoiled. It is also important to follow storage instructions carefully for these foods (for example, if they specify that the product must be refrigerated).\n\nBathroom products and toiletries usually state a time in months from the date the product is opened, by which they should be used. This is often indicated by a graphic of an open tub, with the number of months written inside (e.g., \"12M\" means use the product within 12 months of opening). Similarly, some food products say \"eat within X days of opening\".\n\n\"Open dating\" is the use of a date stamped on the package of a food product to help determine how long to display the product for sale. This benefits the consumer by ensuring that the product is of best quality when sold. An open date does not supersede a use-by date, if shown, which should still be followed.\n\nThese dates are intended to help keep track of the stock in stores. Food that has passed its \"sell by\" or \"display until\" date, but has not yet reached its use by / best before date will still be edible, assuming it has been stored correctly. It is common practice in large stores to throw away such food, as it makes the stock control process easier; another common practice is for wholesalers to repurchase the expired product and resell it to discount stores at much lower clearance sale prices. These practices reduce the risk of customers unknowingly buying food without looking at the date, only to find out the next day that they cannot use it. Tampering with the posted date is illegal in many countries.\n\nMost stores will rotate stock by moving the products with the earliest dates to the front of shelving units, which encourages customers to buy them first and hopefully saves them from having to be either marked down or thrown away, both of which would result in financial loss.\n\nAn expiration date on food differs from a best-before date. According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency \"Expiration dates are required only on certain foods that have strict compositional and nutritional specifications which might not be met after the expiration date.\"\n\nIn Canada expiration dates must be used on the following food items (list and comments copied from\nCFIA website):\n\n\nThe concern is that after the expiration date has passed, the food may not have the same nutrient content as specified on the packaging and for the listed regulated products, the nutritional content is quite important. The CFIA recommends that food should be discarded and should not be bought, sold or eaten beyond the stated expiration date. This contrasts with a best before date which is an indication of how long properly stored prepackaged food is expected to retain its \"freshness, taste, nutritional value, or any other qualities claimed by the manufacturer.\" Passing a best before date is not necessarily a reason to discard the food. \"Sell by\" and \"manufactured on\" dates are related concepts that may guide the consumer.\n\nNon-food items may also carry an expiration date. For example, in Canada, all children are required to be secured in an infant car seat while in a motor vehicle that is in motion. Users are required by law to follow manufacturer's directions. There is no specific law that requires an expiration date, but all Transport Canada approved car seats sold in Canada carry a manufacturer applied expiration date that ranges between 6 and 9 years from date of manufacture. The rational is that car seats are subjected to heat, cold, sun exposure, abuse by the children, and long term storage between children, all of which can degrade the structure and function of the car seat and cause a failure during a crash event. Further, beyond the expiration date the manufacturer will no longer be monitoring the safety of the seat through testing. Transport Canada advises to destroy an expired car seat and dispose of it at a landfill or recycling facility. Never give an expired seat to someone else or to charity.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration in the United States notes that \"[a] principle of U.S. food law is that foods in U.S. commerce must be wholesome and fit for consumption\". However, the agency also states:\n\nMost expiration dates are used as guidelines based on normal and expected handling and exposure to temperature. Use prior to the expiration date does not guarantee the safety of a food or drug, and a product is not necessarily dangerous or ineffective after the expiration date. According to the United States Department of Agriculture, \"canned foods are safe indefinitely as long as they are not exposed to freezing temperatures, or temperatures above 90 °F (32.2° C). If the cans look okay, they are safe to use. Discard cans that are dented, rusted, or swollen. High-acid canned foods (tomatoes, fruits) will keep their best quality for 12 to 18 months; low-acid canned foods (meats, vegetables) for 2 to 5 years\". .\n\n\"Sell by date\" is a less ambiguous term for what is often referred to as an \"expiration date\". Most food is still edible after the expiration date. A product that has passed its shelf life might still be safe, but quality is no longer guaranteed. In most food stores, waste is minimized by using stock rotation, which involves moving products with the earliest sell by date from the warehouse to the sales area, and then to the front of the shelf, so that most shoppers will pick them up first and thus they are likely to be sold before the end of their shelf life. This is important, as consumers enjoy fresher goods, and furthermore some stores can be fined for selling out of date products; most if not all would have to mark such products down as wasted, resulting in a financial loss.\n\nThe expiration date of pharmaceuticals specifies the date the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the expiration date. A rare exception is a case of renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired tetracycline. A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.\n\n\n"}

To carry out this project, Nadal had, from the outset, the complicity of Xavier Fàbregas, Head of Servei de Cinematografia i Teatre at the Generalitat de Catalunya and Joan Font, director of Comediants.\n\nAt that precise historic moment, a series of factors contributed to getting this initial project of the ground:\n\n\n\n"}

It was a form of gunboat diplomacy and this incident occurred intentionally for the purpose of opening Korea.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Korean peninsula was the scene of a power struggle between several imperial powers including the Russians and the French, as well as the Chinese and the Japanese.\n\nThe Meiji Restoration of 1868 ended the 265-year-old feudalistic Tokugawa shogunate in Japan. The new government of Japan sent a messenger holding a letter with the sovereign's message which informed of the founding of a new administration of Japan to the government of Korea Joseon dynasty on December 19, 1868.\n\nHowever, the Koreans refused to receive the letter because it contained the Chinese characters 皇 (\"royal, imperial\") and 勅 (\"imperial decree\"). According to the political system of the day, only the Chinese emperor was allowed to use these characters, as they signified the imperial authority of China. Hence, their use by a Japanese sovereign was considered unacceptable to the Koreans, as it implied he was an equal of the emperor of China.\n\nThe Chinese suggested to the Koreans to receive the sovereign letter from Japan, because China knew the power of Japan at that moment. Despite government-level negotiations held in 1875 at Pusan, no substantial progress was made. Instead, tension grew as the Koreans continued to refuse to recognize Japan's claims of equality with China and Japanese politicians insisted on the conquest of the Joseon dynasty to solve social problems in Japan.\n\nGanghwa Island, had been a site of violent confrontations between Korean forces and foreign forces in the previous decade. In 1866, the island was briefly occupied during the French expedition against Korea, and in 1871 the site of an American expedition. The memories of those confrontations were very fresh, and there was little question that the Korean garrison would shoot at any approaching foreign ship.\n\nOn the morning of September 20 1875, the \"Un'yō\" under the command of Inoue Yoshika was dispatched to survey Korean coastal waters. While surveying the Western coast of Korea, the Japanese put ashore a party on Ganghwa Island to request water and provisions. When the shore batteries of the Korean forts fired on the \"Un'yō\", the Japanese response was swift and severe. After bombarding the Korean fortifications, the Japanese landed a shore party that torched several houses on the island and engaged Korean troops. Armed with modern rifles, they made quick work of the Koreans who carried matchlock muskets; consequently, thirty-five Korean soldiers were killed. News of the incident did not reach Tokyo until September 28, but the following day the Dajōkan decided to dispatch gun boats to Pusan to protect Japanese residents there. It also began deliberating whether or not to send a mission to Korea to settle the incident.\n\nThe number of casualties of the incident were recorded at 35 of the Joseon Dynasty with two Japanese soldiers wounded. In addition, 16 Korean naval personnel were captured by Japan. Many weapons were also looted. After the incident, the Imperial Japanese Navy blockaded the immediate area and requested an official apology from the Joseon government, which was concluded with the dispatch of the Kuroda mission and the signing of the Treaty of Ganghwa on February 27, 1876, which opened the Korean Peninsula to Japanese and foreign trade.\n\n\n"}

The cast includes Daniel Brühl, Katrin Saß, Chulpan Khamatova, and Maria Simon. The story follows a family in East Germany; the mother (Saß) is dedicated to the socialist cause and falls into a coma shortly before the 1989 revolution. When she is revived eight months later, her son (Brühl) attempts to protect her from fatal shock by concealing the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of socialism.\n\nMost scenes were shot at the Karl-Marx-Allee in Berlin and around Plattenbauten near Alexanderplatz. \"Good Bye, Lenin!\" received numerous honours, including the European Film Award for Best Film and German Film Award for Best Feature Film.\n\nThe film is set in East Berlin, from October 1989 to just after German reunification a year later.\n\nAlex lives with his sister, Ariane, his mother, Christiane, and Ariane's infant daughter, Paula. Alex's father abandoned the family and fled to the West in 1978; his mother filled the void left by her marriage by joining the Socialist Unity Party and devoting her time to advocating for citizens and matters of public interest. While Christiane believes in the ability of socialism to improve Germany and the world, her children are more cynical. Alex is disgusted with the drab celebration of East Germany's 40th anniversary and participates in an anti-government demonstration. There he meets a girl, but they are separated by the Volkspolizei before they can properly introduce themselves.\n\nWhen Christiane sees Alex being arrested, she suffers a near-fatal heart attack and falls into a coma. While visiting his mother in the hospital, Alex encounters the girl he met in the demonstration, Lara, a nurse from the Soviet Union who is caring for his mother. Alex and Lara soon begin dating and develop a close bond.\n\nShortly afterward, Erich Honecker resigns from office, the Berlin Wall falls, and capitalism comes to East Berlin. The TV repair shop where Alex works closes, and he gets a job selling and installing satellite dishes for a West German firm. There, he befriends a coworker, Denis Domaschke, who is an aspiring filmmaker. When Ariane's university closes, she works at a Burger King drive-through; she begins dating the store manager, Rainer, who soon moves into their apartment.\n\nAfter eight months, Christiane awakens from her coma, but she is severely weakened and her doctor warns that any shock might cause another, possibly fatal, heart attack. Alex realizes that the news of recent events would be too much for her to bear and decides to maintain the illusion that things are as before in the German Democratic Republic. To do so, Alex, Ariane, and Lara get the apartment's old East German furniture and decor out of storage, dress in their old clothes, and repackage new Western products in old East German jars. Their deception is successful, though increasingly complicated as Christiane occasionally witnesses strange occurrences, such as a gigantic Coca-Cola advertisement banner on an adjacent building that she sees through her bedroom window. With Denis' help, Alex edits old tapes of East German news broadcasts and creates fake broadcasts to explain these odd events. Meanwhile, Alex and Ariane's attempts to exchange their mother's life savings, all in East German marks, for West German marks are unsuccessful as the deadline for exchanges passes before they find where Christiane was keeping the money.\n\nChristiane eventually gains strength and wanders outside one day while Alex is asleep. She sees all her neighbors' old furniture piled up in the street, new West German cars for sale in a lot next door, advertisements for Western corporations, and a statue of Lenin being flown away by a helicopter. Alex and Ariane quickly take her home and show her a fake newscast explaining East Germany is now accepting refugees from the West following a severe economic crisis there.\n\nSoon after, the family goes to inspect their dacha in the countryside at Christiane's suggestion. While they are there, Christiane reveals her own secret: Her husband had fled because his refusal to join the ruling party had made his life and job increasingly difficult, and the plan had been for the rest of the family to join him. Christiane, fearing the government would take Alex and Ariane away from her if things went wrong, chose to stay. Contrary to what she told her children, their father wrote many letters to them, which she hid away. As she regrets the decision and declares her wish that she could see her husband one last time to make amends, Christiane relapses and is taken back to the hospital.\n\nAlex meets his father, Robert, who has remarried, has two children with his new wife, and now lives in West Berlin. He convinces him to see Christiane one last time, stating he should say he was moved to return East to see his dying wife. Under pressure to reveal the truth about the fall of the East, Alex creates a final fake news segment, convincing a taxi driver (who is or resembles the cosmonaut Sigmund Jähn, the first German in space and Alex's childhood hero) to act in the false news report as the new leader of East Germany and to give a speech about opening the borders to the West. However, Christiane already knows the truth (Lara tried to convince her about the real political developments earlier the same day). Nevertheless, she reacts fondly to her son's effort, without mentioning anything.\n\nChristiane dies two days later: She outlives the GDR, passing away three days after full official German reunification. Alex, Ariane, Lara, Denis, and Robert scatter her ashes in the wind using an old toy rocket Alex made with his father during his childhood.\n\nThe film score was composed by Yann Tiersen, except the version of \"Summer 78\" sung by Claire Pichet. Stylistically, the music is very similar to Tiersen's earlier work on the soundtrack to \"Amélie\". One piano composition, \"Comptine d'un autre été : L'après-midi\", is used in both films.\n\nSeveral famous GDR songs are featured. Two children, members of the Ernst Thälmann Pioneer Organisation, sing \"Unsere Heimat\" (Our Homeland). Friends of Christiane (living in the same building) follow with \"\" (Build Up! Build Up!), another anthem of the Free German Youth. The final fake newscast with Sigmund Jähn features a rousing rendition of the GDR national anthem, \"Auferstanden aus Ruinen\".\n\nThe film received strong positive reviews, holding a rating of 90% on Rotten Tomatoes. \"Empire\" gave the film four stars out of five with a verdict of, \"An ingenious little idea that is funny, moving and—gasp!—even makes you think.\"\n\n\"Empire\" magazine ranked it 91st in \"The 100 Best Films of World Cinema\" in 2010.\n\n\"Good Bye, Lenin!\" was submitted for consideration for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but not nominated.\n\n\n"}

They were acting as an agency for investigating cyber-attacks. Since then, Group-IB has been involved in a range of incident response and investigations across the world, actively cooperating with international partners to detect perpetrators and bring them to justice.\n\nGroup-IB participated in the first successful cybercrime case in Russia where the organizers of the criminal groups were identified and arrested. These criminals were involved in financial theft from bank accounts using malware for PCs, mobile devices, phishing attacks, and targeted attacks on financial institutions in Russia. The company is generally involved in a series of international operations and leverages close cooperation with international law enforcement agencies to get the criminals wherever they hide. According to Group-IB, up to 80% of all high-profile investigation cases in the field of high-tech crime in Russia are supported by Group-IB experts.\n\nIn 2010 Group-IB established the largest computer forensics laboratory in Eastern Europe.\n\nIn 2011 the company established its Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT)—the first round-the-clock computer security incident response team in Eastern Europe, called CERT-GIB. With the status of a Competent Security Organization recognized by Coordination Center for TLD RU (administrator of the national top-level domains .ru and .рф) and collaboration with CERTs worldwide, the company has developed a series of effective intellectual property protection services.\n\nGroup-IB successfully protected the Sochi 2014 Olympic brand, products and ticket sales, blocked pirated links to TV series and movies owned by Sony Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Fox TV series', Discovery Channel, Amedia (which has exclusive rights to HBO TV series in Russia), as well as fraudulent websites abusing brands of popular banks and payment systems.\n\nSince 2012, Group-IВ has been developing their Early Warning System to provide cyber defence to companies around the world. In 2015 Gartner included Group-IB's core product—Group-IB Intelligence—in the top 7 global threat intelligence solutions along with products developed by IBM, FireEye, RSA and Check Point.\n\nSince 2007, Group-IB has been cooperating with Microsoft.

Secure Portal prevents unauthorized access to personal accounts, personal data, web users' bonus accounts and various fraudulent scenarios from using bots to competitor's offers displays on a portal site.\n\n\nIn May 2017 Group-IB issued a report that proved there is a connection between Lazarus group who stole $18 mln from Bangladesh Central Bank, conducted a number of attacks on Polish banks, as well as attempted to infect hundreds of financial organizations in 30 countries around the globe, including European Central Bank, Central Banks of Russia, Brazil and Venezuela – with North Korea. Company experts made a research of the complex technological infrastructure, communications channels, and concealment techniques, presented new evidence of Lazarus attribution to North Korea and revealed details of the attack.\n\nIn July 2016, a group of masked cyber-criminals \"jackpotted\" 34 ATMs operated by First Bank, one of Taiwan's largest banks. The perpetrators stole T$83.27 (over $2m USD). According to CCTV footage, the thieves used cellphones to trigger the ATMs to automatically dispense money. Group-IB experts were the first to discover the \"jackpotting\" attack tactics used by the Cobalt gang to force ATMs to spit out cash using malware. Group-IB released a report \"Cobalt: Logical attacks on ATMs\" that provided a detailed analysis of the attack scheme. To get into the bank's internal network, hackers used spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The emails purported to come from the European Central Bank, the ATM maker Wincor Nixdorf, and local banks. After establishing control over the bank's internal network, the criminals searched for network segments, from which they could gain access to ATMs and workstations of bank employees who control ATMs. Once access to ATMs was obtained, they uploaded a specific software to them, allowing criminals to control cash dispensers.\n\nIn February 2016, Group-IB published a report titled \"Analysis of attacks against trading and bank card systems\" about the first major successful attack on a trading system provoking major exchange volatility. In February 2015, the Corkow criminal group infected a trading system terminal of Kazan-based Energobank using a specialized Trojan software resulting in trades of more than $400 million. The hackers moved the ruble-dollar rate more than 15 percent in minutes on the Moscow Exchange. The bank claimed losses of 244 million rubles ($3.2 million) due to the trades.\n\nIn March 2016 Group-IB published a report on activity of the Buhtrap criminal group that managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 million) from August 2015 to February 2016. The high effectiveness of these attacks was achieved due to spear phishing mailouts, including those sent acting as the Central Bank of Russia, which were used by criminals to gain access to the corporate network. Criminals obtained access to computers running the Automated Working Station of the Central Bank Client (AWS CBC), a free software that delivers payment documents on behalf of the Central Bank, and performed fraudulent transactions acting as the bank. The attack scheme outlined in the report published by Group-IB was later used to perform thefts via SWIFT. Buhtrap was the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increased the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks had to shut down the whole infrastructure, because the worm was able to gain full control over the network using a single infected machine.\n\nIn late 2014 Fox-IT and Group-IB jointly released a report on the Anunak (aka Carbanak) hacker group that had stolen more than 1 billion rubles from over 50 Russian banks. In Europe Anunak attacked POS terminals of large retail store chains with data of several million clients infected. The group has not performed successful thefts since early 2015.\n\nIn autumn 2015, a novel technique of targeted attacks called a \"reverse ATM attack\" that allowed criminals to steal money from ATMs. \"Money mules\" (criminal payment agents) would deposit small sums into unembossed cards with legitimate accounts, immediately withdrawing what they'd put in. They also took a receipt from the ATM, which contained a payment reference number and the amount withdrawn. That information was sent to hackers who would use the data and their access to thousands of point of sale terminals, primarily based in the USA and the Czech Republic, to create \"a reversal operation\" on a terminal that tricked the bank into believing the withdrawal of funds had been cancelled. At the point of sale terminal, this looked as though goods were returned or a payment was declined, whilst to the banks it appeared the ATM withdrawal had been cancelled. Funds were returned to the account, though the perpetrators had already taken the cash. The process was repeated until there was no money remaining in the target ATM. During these attacks criminals managed to steal 252 million rubles ($3.8 million) from five large Russian banks. The fraud can no longer be perpetrated due to additional security systems implemented by banks with the assistance from VISA and Mastercard.\n\nAccording to the report released by Group-IB in March 2015, hackers from the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) attacked 600 Russian Internet resources in 2014. Criminals primarily defaced websites placing pictures and video with ISIS propaganda. Hackers are believed to have attacked not only government organizations, banks and popular resources, but also galleries and schools. These attacks were chaotic and massive; researchers believe that they were aimed to gain experience and perform reconnaissance of the Russian Internet. According to Group-IB's report, these attacks were performed not just by ISIS cyber division, Cyber Caliphate, but by 3 more criminal groups called Team System Dz, FallaGa Team and Global Islamic Caliphate totalling over 40 members.\n\nIn Autumn 2013 Group-IB supported investigative activity that resulted in the arrest of Dmitry Fedotov, known under the nickname Paunch, the author of the infamous Blackhole exploit pack, which was, at the time, used to conduct 40% of infections worldwide. The criminal was sentenced to 7 years in prison according to the national legislation in April 2016.\n\nIn 2012 law enforcement agencies, with assistance from Sberbank and Group-IB, arrested the largest criminal gang in Russia. In two years, the group managed to infect over 1.5 million computers worldwide and steal approximately $250 million from bank accounts. In total, over 100 banks suffered from their attacks throughout the world. Group-IB engaged their partners in the Netherlands and Canada in the investigation, which enabled the company to identify the full chain of actors including the organizer, who owned the botnet, operators, and cashers (\"money mules\"). It was the first case in Russia when all members of the criminal group were arrested; the leaders were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years in prison. In the same year members of other criminal groups, who used Carberp modifications to attack individuals and companies, were arrested. In the summer of 2012 a hacker known as Germes (aka Arashi) was arrested. He was a creator of one of the largest global botnets that had infected over 6 million computers. Following this, 7 members of the Hodprot criminal group were detained. One of the oldest Russian hacker gangs is known to have stolen approximately 125 million rubles from Russian bank accounts. All members of the criminal group were arrested, even though they are known to have used control servers located abroad – in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the USA.\n\nIn April 2015 members of a hacker group, which had infected over 340,000 Android-based devices to steal money from bank accounts, were arrested with assistance of Group-IB and Sberbank. Hackers dubbed their malware \"the fifth Reich\" and used Nazi symbols in the control system. The hackers distributed the malware via SMS messages containing a link to download a program masked as Adobe Flash Player. The Trojan enabled hackers to intercept SMS notifications from banks and furtively confirm money transfer to hackers' accounts. The attack scheme was similar to that used by WapLook, the first criminal group members which were arrested for money theft from individuals using malicious mobile apps in Russia. Group leaders were arrested in September 2014 with assistance from Group-IB. In May 2017 Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrest of Cron gang that had infected more than 1 mln smartphones. Group-IB provided expert support to the investigation. Cron Banking Trojan spread itself in two ways—via SMS, when the user clicked on the link in the message and installed a malicious application, or disguised as a legitimate application Navitel, Framaroot, Pornhub, Avito etc. The hackers infected up to 3,500 smartphones daily, and managed to steal about $1 mln in total.\n\nIn June 2015, twin brother hackers were reportedly arrested in St. Petersburg, Russia, as part of a police operation assisted by Group-IB. Over 4 years, the Popelysh brothers had stolen money from client accounts of VTB24 online banking using a fake bank page to grab client data. This was the first case in Russia, when legal proceedings were taken against criminals using phishing schemes.\n"}
{"id": "31567052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31567052", "title": "International cybercrime", "text": "International cybercrime\n\nThere is no commonly agreed single definition of “cybercrime”. It refers to illegal internet-mediated activities that often take place in global electronic networks. Cybercrime is \"international\" or \"transnational\" – there are ‘no cyber-borders between countries'. International cybercrimes often challenge the effectiveness of domestic and international law and law enforcement. Because existing laws in many countries are not tailored to deal with cybercrime, criminals increasingly conduct crimes on the Internet in order to take advantages of the less severe punishments or difficulties of being traced. No matter, in developing or developed countries, governments and industries have gradually realized the colossal threats of cybercrime on economic and political security and public interests. However, complexity in types and forms of cybercrime increases the difficulty to fight back. In this sense, fighting cybercrime calls for international cooperation. Various organizations and governments have already made joint efforts in establishing global standards of legislation and law enforcement both on a regional and on an international scale. China–United States cooperation is one of the most striking progress recently, because they are the top two source countries of cybercrime.\n\nInformation and communication technology (ICT) plays an important role in helping ensure interoperability and security based on global standards. General countermeasures have been adopted in cracking down cybercrime, such as legal measures in perfecting legislation and technical measures in tracking down crimes over the network, Internet content control, using public or private proxy and computer forensics, encryption and plausible deniability, etc. Due to the heterogeneity of law enforcement and technical countermeasures of different countries, this article will mainly focus on legislative and regulatory initiatives of international cooperation.\n\nIn terms of cybercrime, we may often associate it with various forms of Internet attacks, such as hacking, Trojans, malware (keyloggers), botnet, Denial-of-Service (DoS), spoofing, phishing, and vishing. Though cybercrime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities, it can be generally divided into five categories:\n\nIllegal Access: “Hacking” is one of the major forms of offences that refers to unlawful access to a computer system.\n\nData Espionage: Offenders can intercept communications between users (such as e-mails) by targeting communication infrastructure such as fixed lines or wireless, and any Internet service (e.g., e-mail servers, chat or VoIP communications).\n\nData Interference: Offenders can violate the integrity of data and interfere with them by deleting, suppressing, or altering data and restricting access to them.\n\nPornographic Material (Child-Pornography): Sexually related content was among the first content to be commercially distributed over the Internet.\n\nRacism, Hate Speech, Glorification of Violence: Radical groups use mass communication systems such as the Internet to spread propaganda.\n\nReligious Offences: A growing number of websites present material that is in some countries covered by provisions related to religious offences, e.g., anti-religious written statements.\n\nSpam: Offenders send out bulk mails by unidentified source and the mail server often contains useless advertisements and pictures.\n\nCommon copyright offences: cyber copyright infringement of software, music or films.\n\nTrademark violations: A well-known aspect of global trade. The most serious offences include phishing and domain or name-related offences, such as cybersquatting.\n\nFraud: online auction fraud, advance fee fraud, credit card fraud, Internet banking\n\nForgery: manipulation of digital documents.\n\nIdentity theft: It refers to stealing private information including Social Security Numbers (SSN), passport numbers, Date of birth, addresses, phone numbers, and passwords for non-financial and financial accounts.\n\nCyberterrorism: The main purposes of it are propaganda, information gathering, preparation of real-world attacks, publication of training material, communication, terrorist financing and attacks against critical infrastructure.\n\nCyberwarfare: It describes the use of ICTs in conducting warfare using the Internet.\n\nCyberlaundering: Conducting crime through the use of virtual currencies, online casinos etc.\n\nSimilar to conventional crime, economic benefits, power, revenge, adventure, ideology and lust are the core driving forces of cybercrime. Major threats caused by those motivations can be categorized as following:\n\nEconomic security, reputation and social trust are severely challenged by cyber fraud, counterfeiting, impersonation and concealment of identity, extortion, electronic money laundering, copyright infringement and tax evasion.\n\nPublic interest and national security is threatened by dissemination of offensive material —e.g., pornographic, defamatory or inflammatory/intrusive communication— cyber stalking/harassment, Child pornography and paedophilia, electronic vandalism/terrorism.\n\nPrivacy, domestic and even diplomatic information security are harmed by unauthorized access and misuse of ICT, denial of services, and illegal interception of communication.\n\nDomestic, as well as international security are threatened by cybercrime due to its transnational characteristic. No single country can really handle this big issue on their own. It is imperative for us to collaborate and defend cybercrime on a global scale.\n\nAs more and more criminals are aware of potentially large economic gains that can be achieved with cybercrime, they tend to switch from simple adventure and vandalism to more targeted attacks, especially platforms where valuable information highly concentrates, such as computer, mobile devices and the Cloud. There are several emerging international trends of cybercrime.\n\n\nG8\n\nGroup of Eight (G8) is made up of the heads of eight industrialized countries: the U.S., the United Kingdom, Russia, France, Italy, Japan, Germany, and Canada.\n\nIn 1997, G8 released a Ministers' Communiqué that includes an action plan and principles to combat cybercrime and protect data and systems from unauthorized impairment. G8 also mandates that all law enforcement personnel must be trained and equipped to address cybercrime, and designates all member countries to have a point of contact on a 24 hours a day/7 days a week basis.\n\nUnited Nations\n\nIn 1990 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution dealing with computer crime legislation.\nIn 2000 the UN GA adopted a resolution on combating the criminal misuse of information technology.\nIn 2002 the UN GA adopted a second resolution on the criminal misuse of information technology.\n\nITU\n\nThe International Telecommunication Union (ITU), as a specialized agency within the United Nations, plays a leading role in the standardization and development of telecommunications and cybersecurity issues. The ITU was the lead agency of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS).\n\nIn 2003, Geneva Declaration of Principles and the Geneva Plan of Action were released, which highlights the importance of measures in the fight against cybercrime.\n\nIn 2005, the Tunis Commitment and the Tunis Agenda were adopted for the Information Society.\n\nCouncil of Europe\n\nCouncil of Europe is an international organisation focusing on the development of human rights and democracy in its 47 European member states.\n\nIn 2001, the Convention on Cybercrime, the first international convention aimed at Internet criminal behaviors, was co-drafted by the Council of Europe with the addition of USA, Canada, and Japan and signed by its 46 member states. But only 25 countries ratified later. [8] It aims at providing the basis of an effective legal framework for fighting cybercrime, through harmonization of cybercriminal offences qualification, provision for laws empowering law enforcement and enabling international cooperation.\n\nAPEC\n\nAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is an international forum that seeks to promote promoting open trade and practical economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region.\nIn 2002, APEC issued Cybersecurity Strategy which is included in the Shanghai Declaration. The strategy outlined six areas for co-operation among member economies including legal developments, information sharing and co-operation, security and technical guidelines, public awareness, and training and education.\n\nOECD\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an international economic organisation of 34 countries founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade.\n\nIn 1990, the Information, Computer and Communications Policy (ICCP) Committee created an Expert Group to develop a set of guidelines for information security that was drafted until 1992 and then adopted by the OECD Council. In 2002, OECD announced the completion of \"Guidelines for the Security of Information Systems and Networks: Towards a Culture of Security\".\n\nEuropean Union\n\nIn 2001, the European Commission published a communication titled \"Creating a Safer Information Society by Improving the Security of Information Infrastructures and Combating Computer-related Crime\".\n\nIn 2002, EU presented a proposal for a “Framework Decision on Attacks against Information Systems”. The Framework Decision takes note of Convention on Cybercrime, but concentrates on the harmonisation of substantive criminal law provisions that are designed to protect infrastructure elements.\n\nCommonwealth\n\nIn 2002, the Commonwealth of Nations presented a model law on cybercrime that provides a legal framework to harmonise legislation within the Commonwealth and enable international cooperation. The model law was intentionally drafted in accordance with the Convention on Cybercrime.\n\nECOWAS\n\nThe Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) is a regional group of west African Countries founded in 1975 it has fifteen member states. In 2009, ECOWAS adopted the Directive on Fighting Cybercrime in ECOWAS that provides a legal framework for the member states, which includes substantive criminal law as well as procedural law.\n\nGCC\n\nIn 2007, the Arab League and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) recommended at a conference seeking a joint approach that takes into consideration international standards.\n\nDuring the past few years, public-private partnerships have emerged as a promising approach for tackling cybersecurity issues around the globe. Executive branch agencies (e.g., the Federal Trade Commission in US), regulatory agencies (e.g., Australian Communications and Media Authority), separate agencies (e.g., ENISA in the EU) and industry (e.g., MAAWG, …) are all involved in partnership.\n\nIn 2004, the London Action Plan was founded, which aims at promoting international spam enforcement cooperation and address spam related problems, such as online fraud and deception, phishing, and dissemination of viruses.\n\nAccording to Sophos, the U.S. remains the top-spamming country and the source of about one-fifth of the world's spam. Since fighting cybercrime involves great amount of sophisticated legal and other measures, only milestones rather than full texts are provided here.\n\nThe first federal computer crime statute was the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984 (CFAA).\n\nIn 1986, Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) was an amendment to the federal wiretap law.\n\n“National Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996”.\n\n“Cyberspace Electronic Security Act of 1999”.\n\n“Patriot Act of 2001”.\n\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) was enacted in 1998.\n\nCyber Security Enhancement Act (CSEA) was passed in 2002.\n\nCan-spam law issued in 2003 and subsequent implementation measures were made by FCC and FTC.\n\nIn 2005 the USA passed the Anti-Phishing Act which added two new crimes to the US Code.\n\nIn 2009, the Obama Administration released Cybersecurity Report and policy.\nCybersecurity Act of 2010, a bill seeking to increase collaboration between the public and the private sector on cybersecurity issues.\n\nA number of agencies have been set up in the U.S. to fight against cybercrime, including the FBI, National Infrastructure Protection Center, National White Collar Crime Center, Internet Fraud Complaint Center, Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of the Department of Justice (DoJ), Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Unit of the DoJ, and Computer Emergency Readiness Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) at Carnegie-Mellon, and so on.\n\nCyberSafe is a public service project designed to educate end users of the Internet about the critical need for personal computer security.\n\nCloud computing: It can make infrastructures more resilient to attacks and functions as data backup as well. However, as the Cloud concentrates more and more sensitive data, it becomes increasingly attractive to cybercriminals.\n\nBetter encryption methods are developed to deal with phishing, smishing and other illegal data interception activities.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation has set up special technical units and developed Carnivore, a computer surveillance system which can intercept all packets that are sent to and from the ISP where it is installed, to assist in the investigation of cybercrime.\n\nPublic-private partnership: in 2006, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) signed an agreement with the United States Department of Commerce (United States Department of Commerce) that they partnered through the Multistakeholder Model of consultation.\n\nIn 2008, the second annual Cyber Storm conference was exercised, involving nine states, four foreign governments, 18 federal agencies and 40 private companies.\n\nIn 2010, National Cyber Security Alliance’s public awareness campaign was launched in partnership with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Trade Commission, and others.\n\nIncentives for ISP: Though the cost of security measures increases, Internet Service Providers (ISP) are encouraged to fight against cybercrime to win consumer support, good reputation and brand image among consumer and peer ISP as well.\n\nUSA has signed and also ratified Convention on Cybercrime.\n\nUnited States has actively participated in G8/OECD/APEC/OAS/U.S.-China cooperation in cracking down international cyber crime.\n\nPrivacy in tracking down cybercrime is being challenged and becomes a controversial issue.\n\nPublic-private partnership. As the U.S. government gets more involved in the development of IT products, many companies worry this may stifle their innovation, even undermining efforts to develop more secure technology products. New legislative proposals now being considered by the U.S. Congress could be potentially intrusive on private industry, which may prevent enterprises from responding effectively to emerging and changing threats. Cyber attacks and security breaches are increasing in frequency and sophistication, they are targeting organizations and individuals with malware and anonymization techniques that can evade current security controls. Current perimeter-intrusion detection, signature-based malware, and anti-virus solutions are providing little defense. Relatively few organizations have recognized organized cyber criminal networks, rather than hackers, as their greatest potential cyber security threat; even fewer are prepared to address this threat.\n\nIn January 2009, China was ranked No.3 spam-producing country in the world, according to data compiled by security vendor Sophos. Sophos now ranks China as spam producer No.20, right behind Spain.\n\nChina's underground economy is booming with estimated 10 billion RMB in 2009. Hacking, malware and spam are immensely popular. With patriotic hacktivism, people hack to defend the country.\n\nCriminal Law – the basic law identifies the law enforcement concerning cybercrime.\n\nIn 2000, the Decision on Internet Security of the Standing Committee of the NPC was passed.\n\nIn 2000, China issued a series of Internet rules that prohibit anyone to propagate pornography, virus and scams.\n\nIn 2003, China signed UN General Assembly Resolution 57/239 on “Creation of a global culture of cybersecurity”.\n\nIn 2003, China signed Geneva Declaration of Principles of the World Summit on the Information Society.\n\nIn 2006, an anti-spam initiative was launched.\n\nIn July 2006, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which included China, issued a statement that its members should implement cybercrime and cybersecurity laws “in accordance with their national conditions and by referring to relevant international instruments”.\n\nIn 2009, ASEAN-China framework agreement on network and information security emergency response were adopted.\n\nIn 2009, agreement within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization on information security was made.\n\nInternet censorship: China has made it tougher to register new Internet domains and has put on stricter content control to help reduce spam.\n\n\"Golden Shield Project\" or \"The Great Firewall of China\": a national Internet control and censorship project.\nIn 2009, Green Dam software: It restricts access to a secret list of sites, and monitors users’activity.\n\nOperating system change: China is trying to get around this by using Linux, though with a lot of technical impediments to solve.\n\nInternet Society of China — the group behind China's anti-spam effort — is working on standards and better ways of cooperating to fight cybercrime.\n\nISPs have become better at working with customers to cut down on the spam problem.\n\nIn 2005, China signed up for the London Action Plan on spam, an international effort to curb the problem.\n\nAnti-Spam “Beijing Declaration”2006 International Anti-Spam Summit was held.\n\nThe APEC Working Group on Telecommunications agreed an action plan for 2010–2015 that included “fostering a safe and trusted ICT environment”.\n\nIn January 2011, the United States and China committed for the first time at head of state level to work together on a bilateral basis on issues of cybersecurity. \"Fighting Spam to Build Trust\" will be the first effort to help overcome the trust deficit between China and the United States on cybersecurity. Cyber Security China Summit 2011 will be held in Shanghai.\n\nSuccessfully cracking down spam volume in 2009. However, insufficient criminal laws and regulations are great impediments in fighting cybercrime. A lack of electronic evidence laws or regulations, low rank of existing internet control regulations and technological impediments altogether limit the efficiency of Chinese governments' law enforcement.\n\n\n"}

After World War I, the region became part of the Kingdom of Italy and Križaj became an Italian citizen. Already at a young age he showed a passion for flight, which led him to pursue a pilot's course at the royal officer school in Capua near Naples, Italy.\n\nDue to his Slovene ethnic origins, he was not allowed into the regular Italian Royal Air Force, but he was nevertheless granted a place in the reserves. Because of the physical hardships endured during the training and his pro-Slovenian and pro-Yugoslav national political stance, he flew a Fiat AS.1 airplane on 25 June 1932 from Udine to Ljubljana, crossing the border of Yugoslavia, which led to much media interest. In 1934, he became a Yugoslav citizen. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he joined the Yugoslav volunteers that fought on the side of the Spanish Republic. He was a member of the Squadron España, and was shot down once and captured during the war. After his return to Yugoslavia, he moved to Serbia, where he lived during World War II.\n\nAfter the war, he became a SFR Yugoslav Air Force military pilot. His life ended on 8 October 1948, when his aircraft, a Yakovlev Yak-3, crashed into Mount Snežnik in southwestern Slovenia because of poor visibility in dense fog. \n\nToday, the Ajdovščina Flying Club is named after Josip Križaj, and there is a monument to him at Portorož Airport.\n\n"}

The first \"tankōbon volume\" was released on December 26, 2016. At their panel in Anime Expo, Yen Press announced their license to the manga. In April 2018, Tokyopop announced that they will release the German version of the manga and that they will publish the first volume on July 26, 2018.\n\nThe anime television series, produced by Yaoyorozu, aired in Japan between January 10, 2017 and March 28, 2017; the anime was simulcast by Crunchyroll, which co-financed and licensed the anime series. The opening theme is by Dōbutsu Biscuits×PPP, while the ending theme is by Mewhan. Original content for TV Tokyo's AniTele service was released from April 1, 2017. An unofficial \"episode 12.1\" 2-minute short was uploaded by the director to Niconico and YouTube on April 5, 2017. Additional shorts have been created in collaboration with Japan Racing Association, Animelo Summer Live 2017, and Nissin Foods.\n\nA second anime season was announced to be greenlit for production on July 26, 2017 and was officially confirmed on September 2, 2018. The second season will be animated by Tomason with Ryuichi Kimura and Takuya Matsumoto replacing Tatsuki as director and writer, respectively. The rest of the cast and staff will reprise their roles. It is set to premiere in January 7, 2019. The opening theme is \"Notteke~ Japari Beat,\" by Dōbutsu Biscuits×PPP.\n\nAn original net animation mini-series based on the original mobile game, titled , began streaming on TV Tokyo's AnimeTele service from August 10, 2018. Crunchyroll began streaming the series from October 16, 2018.\n\nA stage play adaptation of \"Kemono Friends\" with an original storyline ran at the Shinagawa Prince Hotel Club eX in Tokyo from 2017 June 14 to 18. Hiroki Murakami directed the play and penned the script while some of the characters were portrayed by the same actors who voiced them in the anime series. It ran again from 2018 January 13 to 21.\n\nInitial criticisms often latched onto the 3D CGI animation style and character design. Critic Hiroki Azuma reported on Twitter that he stopped watching partway through the first episode. However, its popularity increased explosively after the release of the fourth episode. Referring to the simplistic and childish but addictive nature of the show, it has been described (in ironic disapproval) as \"causing one's IQ to melt\" and \"lowering one's intelligence\". Despite its low production quality, the anime series earned praise from critics and viewers in Japan due to its well crafted storyline and characters, becoming a fad in the country. Nick Creamer of \"Anime News Network\" gave the series an overall grade of B, praising the worldbuilding and criticizing the visual aspects.\n\nMultiple phrases and exclamations from the anime have become popular keywords on Twitter; \"Kemono Friends\"-related phrases have been tweeted by the accounts of Sharp and Warner Bros. Japan.\n\nThe first episode of many anime shows are available for free viewing on Niconico Douga. The first episode of \"Kemono Friends\" quickly surpassed the first episode of \"Is the Order a Rabbit?\" (9 million views as of September 2017; uploaded on April 16, 2014) as well as other popular shows like \"Attack on Titan\" in total views. By February 5, it had surpassed 1 million views, by April 4, it had surpassed 5 million views, and by August 24, it had reached a record-breaking 10 million views.\n\nThe week after episode 12 and around the time episodes would normally air, demand for an episode 13 reached Twitter's international trends list, and the episode 12.1 short that was uploaded that day (April 5) had reached over 1 million views on both Niconico and YouTube by April 7.\n\nThe opening theme song \"Yōkoso Japari Park e\" rose to 3rd place in the iTunes charts upon release. It was revealed on May 20 that \"Yōkoso Japari Park e\" had reached gold status (sales of 100,000+ in Japan). Gen Hoshino has expressed high praise of the song. Hisashi, guitarist of the band Glay, was inspired to create a guitar arrangement of the opening theme song after watching episode 11.\n\nMultiple other \"Kemono Friends\" merchandise topped Amazon rankings upon announcement. The unexpected popularity of the show created a shortage in supply and reservations had to be placed on backorder.\n\nIt was reported on NHK's News Check 11 that an increase in the number of visits to zoos rose as a direct result of inspired viewers of \"Kemono Friends\". \"Kemono Friends\" has also participated in multiple promotional events with zoos and other establishments, such as posting boards in the image of the franchise's anthropomorphized animals near their real-life counterparts. One of the results of this was a Humboldt penguin named Grape-kun () at the Saitama Tobu Zoo that appeared to have fallen in love with its \"Kemono Friends\" depiction, display mating behavior towards the board. The popularity of this unusual incident was substantial, such that the penguin was featured on the \"obi\" of the fourth guidebook, and the board was not removed after the promotion ended. Grape-kun died on October 12, 2017 beside the cutout.\n\nOn September 25, 2017, the director of the anime, Tatsuki, revealed on Twitter that Kadokawa had decided to replace him for the production of the second season; fan response included immense condemnation of Kadokawa and widespread support of Tatsuki, as Tatsuki is regarded as being a highly instrumental part of the anime's charm and success. Fans left angry comments en masse towards Kadokawa on Niconico Douga's stream of the first episode, with some declaring that they would cancel their Niconico Douga premium membership with the service in response to Tatsuki's firing, as Dwango [Niconico's owner] and Kadokawa are both child companies of Kadokawa Dwango. \"The Nikkei\" reported that stock prices for Kadokawa Dwango fell by 3.3% compared to the previous day at the Tokyo Stock Exchange as a result of the news. In response, the production committee of the \"Kemono Friends\" anime announced that director Tatsuki and the animation studio Yaoyorozu had been using the \"Kemono Friends\" property on its own without consulting all concerned parties and that Yaoyorozu would not agree to a normalization in communication and withdrew from the project as a result. A September 26 \"Kemono Friends\" streaming program on Niconico Douga then featured several voice actresses from the anime publicly apologizing for the ongoing controversy, despite having little connection to the corporate decisions made. This led to further backlash against Kadokawa, with accusations that they had used the actresses to deflect blame from the company itself.\n\nOn December 27, 2017, Fukuhara, the producer, confirmed that Yaoyorozu would ultimately not go on to produce the second season.\n\n"}

Now going into its fourth year the next edition will take place August 17–21, 2017. ANIMAZE presents animated film of all genres from around the world which may have limited theatrical releases.\n\nThe festival's premier edition was held on November 18–20, 2011 and was built around core events which all subsequent editions will contain:\n\n\nAnimaze's first objective is to bring animation professionals from around the world together, to showcase animated content from around the world in the hub of animation industry. Animaze awards a various prize to the winning films as determined by a panel of judges and a \"Audience Favorite\" as determined by the viewers.\n\nIn an effort to give back to the community, Animaze Festival dedicates one of its shows for a charity screening that pays tribute to an important era in North American animation, the Saturday Morning Cartoon. Each year, Animaze selects a year and a specific television network and highlights the best shows from that line-up with all the proceeds going towards the charity of their choice.\n\nTo help get local talent involved in the festival, Animaze holds a Student Shorts contest for animation schools in and around the Montreal area. This event pits school vs. school in an old fashion battle-royal. Each school must submit a collection of shorts from its student body and the schools are judged by their cumulative submission.

In the United States, it was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2009 but was brought to market in 2013 as Vecamyl and eventually was marketed by Turing Pharmaceuticals.\n\nChemically, mecamylamine is a secondary aliphatic amine, with a pK of 11.2\n\nMecamylamine has been used as an orally-active ganglionic blocker in treating autonomic dysreflexia and hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, it is more often used now as a research tool.\n\nMecamylamine is also sometimes used as an antiaddictive drug to help people stop smoking tobacco, and is now more widely used for this application than it is for lowering blood pressure. This effect is thought to be due to its blocking α3β4 nicotinic receptors in the brain. It has also been reported to bring about sustained relief from tics in Tourette syndrome when a series of more usually used agents had failed.\n\nIn a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trial in Indian patients with major depression, (\"S\")-mecamylamine (TC-5214) appeared to have efficacy as an augmentation therapy. This is the first substantive evidence that shows that compounds where the primary pharmacology is antagonism to neuronal nicotinic receptors will have antidepressant properties. TC-5214 is currently in Phase III of clinical development as an add-on treatment and on stage II as a monotherapy treatment for major depression. The first results reported from the Phase III trials showed that TC-5214 failed to meet the primary goal and the trial did not replicate the effects that had been encouraging in the Phase II trial.

{"id": "1572901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1572901", "title": "Nine Years' War (Ireland)", "text": "Nine Years' War (Ireland)\n\nThe Nine Years' War or Tyrone's Rebellion took place in Ireland from 1593 to 1603. It was fought between the forces of Gaelic Irish chieftains Hugh O'Neill of Tír Eoghain, Hugh Roe O'Donnell of Tír Chonaill and their allies, against English rule in Ireland. The war was fought in all parts of the country, but mainly in the northern province of Ulster. It ended in defeat for the Irish lords, which led to their exile in the Flight of the Earls, and to the Plantation of Ulster.\n\nThe war against O'Neill and his allies was the largest conflict fought by England in the Elizabethan era. At the height of the conflict (1600–1601) more than 18,000 soldiers were fighting in the English army in Ireland. By contrast, the English army assisting the Dutch during the Eighty Years' War was never more than 12,000 strong at any one time.\n\nThe Nine Years' War was caused by the clashes between the Gaelic Irish lord Hugh O'Neill and the advance of the English state in Ireland, from control over the Pale to ruling the whole island. In resisting this advance, O'Neill managed to rally other Irish septs who were dissatisfied with English government and some Catholics who opposed the spread of Protestantism in Ireland.\n\nHugh O'Neill came from the powerful Ó Néill sept of Tyrone, which dominated the centre of the northern province of Ulster. His father, Matthew O'Neill, Baron Dungannon, was the reputed son of Conn O'Neill the Lame, the first O'Neill to be created Earl of Tyrone by the English Crown. Matthew O'Neill was murdered, and Seán 'An Díomais' Ó Néill banished the child Hugh O'Neill from Ulster. The Hovenden family brought Hugh up in the Pale, and the English authorities sponsored him as a reliable lord. In 1587 Hugh O'Neill persuaded Queen Elizabeth I to make him Earl of Tyrone (or \"Tir Eoghain\"), the English title his grandfather had held. However, the real power in Ulster lay not in the legal title of Earl of Tyrone, but in the position of The Ó Néill, or chief of the O'Neills, then held by Turlough Luineach Ó Neill. This position commanded the obedience of all the O'Neills and their dependants in central Ulster; in 1595. Only after Turlough Luineach O'Neill died in September 1595 could Hugh O'Neill be inaugurated as 'the O'Neill'.\n\nFrom Hugh Roe O'Donnell, his ally, Hugh O'Neill enlisted Scottish mercenaries (known as Redshanks). Within his own territories, O'Neill was entitled to limited military service from his sub-lords or \"uirithe\". He also recruited his tenants and dependants into military service and tied the peasantry to the land to increase food production (see Kern). In addition, he hired large contingents of Irish mercenaries (known as \"buanadha\") under leaders such as Richard Tyrell. To arm his soldiers, O'Neill bought muskets, ammunition and pikes from Scotland and England. From 1591, O'Donnell, on O'Neill's behalf, had been in contact with Philip II of Spain, appealing for military aid against their common enemy and citing also their shared Catholicism. With the aid of Spain, O'Neill could arm and feed over 8,000 men, unprecedented for a Gaelic lord, and so was well prepared to resist any further English attempts to govern Ulster.\n\nBy the early 1590s, the north of Ireland was attracting the attention of Lord Deputy Fitzwilliam, who had been charged with bringing the area under crown control. A provincial presidency was proposed; the candidate for office was Henry Bagenal, an English colonist settled in Newry, who would seek to impose the authority of the crown through sheriffs to be appointed by the Dublin government. O'Neill had eloped with Bagenal's sister, Mabel, and married her against her brother's wishes; the bitterness of this episode was made more intense after Mabel's early death a few years after the marriage, when she was reportedly in despair about her husbands's neglect and his mistresses.\n\nIn 1591, Fitzwilliam broke up the MacMahon lordship in Monaghan when The MacMahon, hereditary leader of the sept, resisted the imposition of an English sheriff; he was hanged and his lordship divided. There was an outcry, with several sources alleging corruption against Fitzwilliam, but the same policy was soon applied in Longford (territory of the O'Farrells) and East Breifne (Cavan — territory of the O'Reillys). Any attempt to further the same in the O'Neill and O'Donnell territories was bound to be resisted by force of arms.\n\nThe most significant difficulty for English forces in confronting O'Neill lay in the natural defences that Ulster enjoyed. By land there were only two viable points of entry to the province for troops marching from the south: at Newry in the east, and Sligo in the west – the terrain in between was largely mountains, woodland, bog and marshes. Sligo Castle was held by the O'Connor sept, but suffered constant threat from the O'Donnells; the route from Newry into the heart of Ulster ran through several easily defended passes and could only be maintained in wartime with a punishing sacrifice by the Crown of men and money.\n\nThe English did have a foothold within Ulster, around Carrickfergus north of Belfast Lough, where a small colony had been planted in the 1570s; but here too the terrain was unfavorable for the English, since Lough Neagh and the river Bann, the lower stretch of which ran through the dense forest of Glenconkeyn, formed an effective barrier on the eastern edge of the O'Neill territory. A further difficulty lay in the want of a port on the northern sea coast where the English might launch an amphibious attack into O'Neill's rear. The English strategic situation was complicated by interference from Scots clans, which were supplying O'Neill with soldiers and materials and playing upon the English need for local assistance, while keeping an eye to their own territorial influence in the Route (modern County Antrim).\n\nIn 1592 Hugh Roe O'Donnell had driven an English sheriff, Captain Willis, out of his territory, Tir Chónaill (now part of County Donegal). In 1593, Maguire supported by Troops out of Tyrone led by Hugh O'Neill's brother, Cormac MacBaron, had combined to resist Willis' introduction as Sheriff into Maguire's Fermanagh. After Willis was expelled from Fermanagh Maguire with the aid of MacBaron launched a punishing raids into northern Connacht, burning villages around Ballymote castle. \n. Maguire launched a more ambitious raid into Connacht during June, when he clashed with forces led by the governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, but the English were beaten back and Maguire continued to spoil thorough Roscommon before returning north. Initially O'Neill assisted the English, hoping to be named as Lord President of Ulster himself. Elizabeth I, though, had feared that O'Neill had no intention of being a simple landlord and that his ambition was to usurp her authority and be \"a Prince of Ulster\". For this reason she refused to grant O'Neill provincial presidency or any other position which would have given him authority to govern Ulster on the crown's behalf. Once it became clear that Henry Bagenal was marked to assume the presidency of Ulster, O'Neill accepted that an English offensive was inevitable, and so joined his allies in open rebellion in February 1595, with an attack on the English fort on the River Blackwater.\n\nLater in 1595 O'Neill and O'Donnell wrote to King Philip II of Spain for help, and offered to be his vassals. He also proposed that his cousin Archduke Albert be made Prince of Ireland, but nothing came of this. Philip II replied encouraging them in January 1596. An unsuccessful armada sailed in 1596; the war in Ireland became a part of the wider Anglo-Spanish War.\n\nThe English authorities in Dublin Castle were slow to comprehend the scale of the rebellion. After failed negotiations in 1595, English armies tried to break into Ulster but were repulsed by a trained army including musketeers in prepared positions; after a stinging defeat at the Battle of Clontibret, successive English offensives were driven back in the following years. At the Battle of the Yellow Ford in 1598 up to 2,000 English troops were killed after being attacked on the march to Armagh. The rest were surrounded in Armagh itself but negotiated safe passage for themselves in return for evacuating the town. O'Neill's personal enemy, Sir Henry Bagenal, had been in command of the army and was killed during the early engagements. It was the heaviest defeat ever suffered by the English army in Ireland up to that point.\n\nThe victory prompted uprisings all over the country, with the assistance of mercenaries in O'Neill's pay and contingents from Ulster, and it is at this point that the war developed in its full force. Hugh O'Neill appointed his supporters as chieftains and earls around the country, notably James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald as the Earl of Desmond and Florence MacCarthy as the MacCarthy Mór. In Munster as many as 9,000 men came out in rebellion. The Munster Plantation, the colonisation of the province with English settlers, was dealt a serious blow; the colonists, among them Edmund Spenser, fled for their lives.\n\nOnly a handful of native lords remained consistently loyal to the crown and even these found their kinsmen and followers defecting to the rebels. However all the fortified cities and towns of the country sided with the English colonial government. Hugh O'Neill, unable to take walled towns, made repeated overtures to inhabitants of the Pale to join his rebellion, appealing to their Catholicism and to their alienation from the Dublin government and the provincial administrations. For the most part, however, the Old English remained hostile to their hereditary Gaelic enemies.\n\nIn 1599, Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex arrived in Ireland with over 17,000 English troops. He took the advice of the Irish privy council, to settle the south of the country with garrisons before making an attempt on Ulster, but this dissipated his forces and he ended up suffering numerous setbacks on a desultory progress through south Leinster and Munster. He spent almost all of his time in Ireland awaiting transport that he had been promised before setting out, it being the only effective way of reaching his stated objective of Lough Foyle; however, a lack of administrative efficiency in England caused his plans to go awry and the requisite pack animals and ships were never sent. Those expeditions he did organise were disastrous, especially an expedition crossing the Curlew mountains to Sligo, which was mauled by O'Donnell at the Battle of Curlew Pass. Thousands of his troops, shut up in unsanitary garrisons, died of diseases such as typhoid and dysentery.\n\nWhen he did turn to Ulster, Essex entered a parley with O'Neill and agreed a truce that was heavily criticised by his enemies in London, despite Elizabeth's admission soon afterward that it was \"so seasonably made...as great good...has grown by it.\" Anticipating a recall to England, he set out for London in 1599 without the Queen's permission, where he was executed after attempting a court putsch. He was succeeded in Ireland by Lord Mountjoy, who proved to be a far more able commander, though his greater success could just as well have been because he was provided with all of the administrative support Essex lacked. In addition, two veterans of Irish warfare, George Carew and Arthur Chichester, were given commands in Munster and Ulster respectively.\n\nIn November 1599 O'Neill sent a 22-paragraph document to Queen Elizabeth, listing his terms for a peace agreement. These called for a self-governing Ireland with restitution of confiscated lands and churches, freedom of movement and a strong Roman Catholic identity. In respect of Irish sovereignty he now accepted English overlordship, but requested that the viceroy \".. be at least an earl, and of the privy council of England\". Elizabeth's adviser Sir Robert Cecil wrote \"Ewtopia\" on the document.\n\nGeorge Carew, the English Lord President of Munster, managed more or less to quash the rebellion in Munster by mid-1601, using a mixture of conciliation and force. By the summer of 1601 he had retaken most of the principal castles in Munster and scattered the Irish forces. He did this by negotiating a pact with Florence MacCarthy, the principal Gaelic Irish leader in the province, which allowed MacCarthy to be neutral, while Carew concentrated on attacking the force of James Fitzthomas Fitzgerald, who commanded the main rebel force. As a result, while MacCarthy resisted English raiding parties into his territory, he did not come to Fitzthomas's aid, despite urgings from O'Neill and O'Donnell to do this.\n\nIn the summer of 1600, Carew launched an offensive against Fitzthomas's forces. The English routed Fitzthomas’ forces at Aherlow and in November, Carew reported to London that he had, over the summer, killed 1,200 'rebels' and taken the surrenders of over 10,000. Carew also weakened Florence MacCarthy's position by recruiting a rival MacCarthy chieftain, Donal, to English service.\n\nIn June 1601, James Fitzthomas was captured by the English forces. Shortly afterwards, Carew had Florence MacCarthy arrested after summoning him for negotiations. Both Fitzthomas and MacCarthy were held captive in the Tower of London, where both eventually died. Most of the rest of the local lords submitted, once the principal native leaders had been arrested. O'Neill's mercenaries had been expelled from the province.\n\nMountjoy managed to penetrate the interior of Ulster by seaborne landings at Derry (then belonging to County Coleraine) under Henry Docwra and Carrickfergus under Arthur Chichester. Dowcra and Chichester, helped by Niall Garve O'Donnell, a rival of Hugh Roe, devastated the countryside in an effort to provoke a famine and killed the civilian population at random.\n\nTheir military assumption was that without crops and people or cattle, the rebels could neither feed themselves nor raise new fighters. This attrition quickly began to bite, and it also meant that the Ulster chiefs were tied down in Ulster to defend their own territories.\n\nAlthough O'Neill managed to repulse another land offensive by Mountjoy at the Battle of Moyry Pass near Newry in 1600, his position was becoming desperate.\n\nIn 1601, the long promised Spanish expedition finally arrived in the form of 3,500 soldiers at Kinsale, Cork, virtually the southern tip of Ireland. Mountjoy immediately besieged them with 7,000 men. O'Neill, O'Donnell and their allies marched their armies south to sandwich Mountjoy, whose men were starving and wracked by disease, between them and the Spaniards. During the march south, O'Neill devastated the lands of those who would not support him.\n\nThe English force might have been destroyed by hunger and sickness but the issue was decided in their favour at the Battle of Kinsale. On the 5/6 January 1602, O'Donnell, against the wishes and advice of O'Neill, took the decision to attack the English. Forming up for a surprise attack, the Irish chiefs were themselves surprised by a cavalry charge, resulting in a rout of the Irish forces. The Spanish in Kinsale surrendered after their allies' defeat.\n\nThe Irish forces retreated north to Ulster to regroup and consolidate their position. The Ulstermen lost many more men in the retreat through freezing and flooded country than they had at the actual battle of Kinsale. The last rebel stronghold in the south was taken at the Siege of Dunboy by George Carew.\n\nHugh Roe O'Donnell left for Spain pleading in vain for another Spanish landing. He died in 1602 probably due to poisoning by an English agent. His brother assumed leadership of the O'Donnell clan. Both he and Hugh O'Neill were reduced to guerrilla tactics, fighting in small bands, as Mountjoy, Dowcra, Chichester and Niall Garbh O'Donnell swept the countryside. The English scorched earth tactics were especially harsh on the civilian population, who died in great numbers both from direct targeting and from famine.\n\nIn 1602 O'Neill destroyed his capital at Dungannon due to the approach of Mountjoy's forces, and withdrew to hide in the woods. In a symbolic gesture Mountjoy smashed the O'Neills' inauguration stone at Tullaghogue. Famine soon hit Ulster as a result of the English scorched earth strategy. O'Neill's uirithe or sub-lords (O'Hagan, O'Quinn, MacCann) began to surrender and Rory O'Donnell, Hugh Roe's brother and successor, surrendered on terms at the end of 1602. However, with a secure base in the large and dense forests of Tir Eoghain, O'Neill held out until 30 March 1603, when he surrendered on good terms to Mountjoy, signing the Treaty of Mellifont. Elizabeth I had died on 24 March.\n\nAlthough the war had effectively ended with the signing of the Treaty of Mellifont, its final battles were fought during the English invasion of West Breifne in April 1603, which remained the sole holdout Irish kingdom following O'Neill's capitulation. The kingdom was ruled by Brian Óg O'Rourke, one of the alliance's chief lieutenants and leader of the Irish forces during the Battle of Curlew Pass. He failed to secure any concessions from the treaty as his half-brother Tadhg O'Rourke had fought with the English during the war and was granted lordship of West Breifne in return. Following a twelve-day siege, a force of 3,000 men led by Tadhg, Henry Folliott and Rory O'Donnell eventually brought the area, and thus all of Ireland, under English control on 25 April 1603.\n\nThe leaders of the rebellion received good terms from the new King of England, James I, in the hope of ensuring a final end of the draining war that had brought England close to bankruptcy. O'Neill, O'Donnell and the other surviving Ulster chiefs were granted full pardons and the return of their estates. The stipulations were that they abandon their Irish titles, their private armies, and their control over their dependents, and that they swear loyalty only to the Crown of England. In 1604, Mountjoy declared an amnesty for rebels all over the country. The reason for this apparent mildness was that the English could not afford to continue the war any longer. Elizabethan England did not have a standing army, nor could it force its Parliament to pass enough taxation to pay for long wars. Moreover, it was already involved in a war in the Spanish Netherlands. As it was, the war in Ireland (which cost over £2 million) came very close to bankrupting the English exchequer by its close in 1603.\n\nIrish sources claimed that as many as 60,000 people had died in the Ulster famine of 1602–3 alone. This is likely to be a major overestimate, as in 1600 the total adult population of Ulster has been estimated at only 25,000 to 40,000 people. An Irish death toll of over 100,000 is possible. At least 30,000 English soldiers died in Ireland in the Nine Years' War, mainly from disease. So the total death toll for the war was certainly at least 100,000 people, and probably more.\n\nAlthough O'Neill and his allies received good terms at the end of the war, they were never trusted by the English authorities and the distrust was mutual. O'Neill, O'Donnell and the other Gaelic lords from Ulster left Ireland in 1607 in what is known as the \"Flight of the Earls\". They intended to organise an expedition from a Catholic power in Europe, preferably Spain, to restart the war but were unable to find any military backers.\n\nSpain had signed the Treaty of London in August 1604 with the new Stuart dynasty and did not wish to reopen hostilities. Further, a Spanish fleet had just been destroyed by a Dutch fleet in the Battle of Gibraltar in April 1607. In 1608 Sir Cahir O'Doherty, who had previously fought on the Crown's side against Tyrone, launched O'Doherty's Rebellion when he attacked and burnt Derry. O'Doherty was defeated and killed at the Battle of Kilmacrennan and the rebellion quickly collapsed.\n\nIn 1608 the absent earls' lands were confiscated for trying to start another war, and were soon colonised in the Plantation of Ulster. The Nine Years' War was therefore an important step in the English and Scottish colonisation of Ulster.\n\n\n\n\nSources for Gaelic Ireland:\n"}

The event is held in Columbus, Ohio during late July through early August. As estimated in a 2011 economic impact study conducted by Saperstein & Associates; the State Fair contributes approximately 68.5 million dollars to the state's economy. In 2015, attendance was 982,305, the Fair's highest 12-day attendance on record.\n\nFrom the very first three-day Fair in 1850 in Cincinnati to the 12-day exposition of today (from 1981-2003, the Fair lasted 17 days), the Ohio State Fair has celebrated Ohio's products, its people, and their accomplishments. The Fair vast programme offers concerts, sports competitions, exhibitions, horse show, numerous rides, and lots of food stalls. The concert series lineup is usually announced in late February or early March.\n\nIn 1846, the Ohio Legislature created the 53-member Ohio State Board of Agriculture. One of the Board's first acts was to establish a District Fair. The resulting 1847 District Fair at Wilmington, Ohio and the 1848 District Fair at Xenia, Ohio were both successful, leading to the planning of a State Fair.\n\nThe first Ohio State Fair was planned for September 1849, but an outbreak of Asiatic cholera forced cancellation of those plans. The following year, autumn dates were chosen to lessen the risk of cholera. Even so, the superintendent of grounds, Darius Lapham, died of the disease just a few weeks before the opening date. \n\nCamp Washington, Cincinnati (two miles north of downtown Cincinnati, Ohio) was the site for the first Ohio State Fair, October 2–4, 1850. The site was described as 8–10 acres with grassy slopes, shade trees, and numerous tents. The grounds were enclosed by a -high board fence. Cattle were tethered to a railing along the carriage road. \n\nThe railroads offered strong support to the early State Fairs. Special rates were offered whereby exhibits were transported without charge, and the exhibitor rode for half fare. Several Central Ohioans contributed to the support of the first Fair, including Alfred Kelley, owner of the Columbus and Xenia Railroad.\n\nCash premiums at the first Fair did not exceed $20, with the exception of an award of $50 given to essayists on the topic \"Improving the Soil.\" During the early State Fairs, winners received medals, not ribbons, as awards. In 1850, the silver medal was valued at $3.\n\nThe public was admitted only on the second and third day of the first Fair. Day one was devoted to setting up and judging. Admission was twenty cents, but exhibitors could buy a $1 badge for admission of their families. A visitor could also buy a $1 badge, which admitted one gentleman and two ladies. The two-day attendance was estimated at 25,000 to 30,000 people.\n\nTransportation around Ohio was difficult. Therefore, the majority of exhibitors came from close proximity to the Fair. Officials reasoned that moving the Fair ought to increase interest and attendance.\n\nOver the next 22 years, the Fair was held in the following cities: \n\nFrom 1874 until 1885, the site of Columbus' Franklin Park served as home to the Ohio State Fair. Finally, in 1886, the Fair moved to its current location to what is currently called the Ohio Expo Center and State Fairgrounds. The main entrance to the site was at the southwest corner of the grounds along Woodard Avenue. It is now along 11th Avenue.\n\nOn July 26, 2017, the opening day of the 2017 Fair, a swinging ride known as Fire Ball broke apart mid-swing, flinging passengers out of the ride. One rider, 18-year-old Tyler Jarrell, was flung and killed on impact. Seven other riders were seriously injured, two of whom were reported to be in critical condition. The ride had been inspected earlier in the day and cleared for operation. The Ohio Department of Agriculture and Ohio State Highway Patrol have begun an investigation into the incident, and the Fair announced that it would not operate any rides on July 27 until they are all re-inspected by state authorities. Governor John Kasich considered it to be the \"worst tragedy\" in the Fair's history.\n\nIn response to the incident, the ride's manufacturer, KMG, as well as Chance Morgan—which produces a similar ride, requested that other rides of the same type be shut down pending an investigation into the failure. Preliminary findings by KMG found that the failure was caused by \"excessive corrosion on the interior of the gondola support beam\" over the life of the 18 year-old unit.\n\n1853 – Entertainment crept into the Fair programming with the first pony rides for children and monkeys dressed in hats that danced to minstrel tunes.\n\n1860 – Fair premiums rose to $200 (up from $20 in 1850).\n\n1884 – In July, prior to the Fair's opening, a racing mare kicked over a lantern resulting in 100 stalls being burned. Loss to buildings was set at $1,100. The dead mare was valued at $5,000.\n\n1886 – The current Ohio State Fair site was dedicated on Tuesday, August 31 during the 37th Ohio State Fair. Governor Foraker accepted the grounds in front of a crowd of 6,000.\n\n1890s – At least 16 railroad companies served Columbus and the Fair.\n\n1894 – A college football tournament was held in this year, with Denison University, Miami University, Wittenberg University, Buchtel and Ohio State University participating.\n\n1896 – The Ohio State Fair became the first fair with an electric lighting system. This made it possible to offer night-time racing. Also this year, horseless vehicles made their first appearance at the Ohio State Fair.\n1903 – The first Butter Cow and Calf were featured at the Fair this year. They were made by A.T. Shelton & Company, distributors of Sunbury Creamery Butter. Additional sculptures were added in the 1960s, the subjects of which change every year.\n\n1916 – On the eve of World War I, the largest American flag, measuring , was displayed at the 11th Avenue entrance.\n\n1922 – Just days before the scheduled opening of the Fair, fire raced across the grounds. Six buildings were destroyed including the central group, the Horticulture Building and the East and West Buildings. Loss was estimated at more than $800,000.\n\n1924 – Earliest records of the Ohio State Fair Queen contest date back to this year.\n\n1925 – The Diamond Jubilee Spectacle this year saluted the 75th anniversary of the Fair. More than 2,000 participants enacted the evolution of the Fair in three, 25-year periods on three stages and with fireworks.\n\n1925 – The All-Ohio Boys Band was first mentioned in historical accounts this year. It is now called the All-Ohio State Fair Band and includes both boys and girls.\n\n1928 – The renowned John Philip Sousa Band performed twice daily at the 1928 Fair.\n\n1929 – The Junior Fair was formed this year. Today, Ohio is proud to host the nation's largest Junior Fair with more than 17,000 youth participating. In the same year, the Ohio State Fair Junior Fair Board was formed. The Junior Fair Board is made up of outstanding individuals from various youth organizations including 4-H, Future Farmers of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, Boy Scouts of America, Farm Bureau Youth, and others.\n\n1941 – A sign of the times found 150 female Fair ticket takers were hired in place of men for the first time.\n\n1942–45 – The Board of Agriculture canceled the Ohio State Fair and allowed the War Department to use the grounds and buildings for handling airplane parts and equipment. The Army Air Corps rented the facility for $1 per year. A similar fate befell fairs in Indiana, Illinois and Pennsylvania. When the Army vacated the fairgrounds, they left the grounds and buildings in a shambles.\n\n1957 – The first female livestock judge appeared this year. Mrs. Maurice Neville judged the Yorkshire Swine Show.\n\n1963 – The All-Ohio State Fair Youth Choir was established. It was directed by Glenville Thomas of Zanesville.\n\n1966 – At the 11th Avenue gate, the new OHIO entrance was built at a cost of $40,000.\n\n1968 – The first Sale of Champions livestock auction was held with sales amounting to $22,674.

Axelsson had persuaded Peter's 17-year-old keeper to give the chimpanzee a brush and paint. After Peter had created several paintings, Axelsson chose the best four and arranged to have them exhibited at the Gallerie Christinae in Göteborg, Sweden. While one critic observed that \"only an ape could have done this\", most praised the works. Rolf Anderberg of the \"Göteborgs-Posten\" wrote, \"Brassau paints with powerful strokes, but also with clear determination. His brush strokes twist with furious fastidiousness. Pierre is an artist who performs with the delicacy of a ballet dancer.\"\n\nAfter the hoax was revealed, Rolf Anderberg insisted that Peter's work was \"still the best painting in the exhibition\".

{"id": "7534287", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7534287", "title": "Second Cairo Conference", "text": "Second Cairo Conference\n\nThe Second Cairo Conference of December 4–6, 1943, held in Cairo, Egypt, addressed Turkey's possible contribution to the Allies in World War II. The meeting was attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and President İsmet İnönü of the Republic of Turkey.\n\nUntil 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill maintained the opinion that Turkey's continuing neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis until the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and especially Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. On January 30, 1943, Churchill had secretly met with İnönü inside a train wagon at the Yenice Station, 23 kilometers outside of Adana in Turkey, to discuss the issue (see the Adana Conference.)\n\nRoosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies.\n\nİnönü knew very well the hardships which his country had to suffer during 11 years of incessant war (the Italo-Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, the First World War, and the Turkish War of Independence) between 1911 and 1922, and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. İnönü also wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the United States and the United Kingdom would stand beside Turkey in case of a Soviet invasion of the Turkish Straits after the war, as Joseph Stalin had openly expressed. The fear of a Soviet invasion and Stalin's unconcealed desire to control the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey to give up its principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in 1952.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason for Turkey's hesitation to immediately join the war on the side of the Allies was the eventual reduction of the amount of financial and military aid which Churchill had promised in Adana. By December 1943 the Anglo-American authorities felt the overall situation had changed so fundamentally that a much smaller scale of assistance than that provided in the Hardihood Agreement of the spring of 1943 would be necessary. The British proposed a reduced scale of Aid Plan Saturn. The Turks, on the other hand, wished to make certain that upon their entry into the war they would be strong enough to defend their homeland and they doubted that the new plan would fully meet their security needs. Churchill, faced with Operation Overlord only six months away, reluctantly concluded that the resources demanded and the time required for strengthening Turkey could not be conceded. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff and their planners, on the other hand, felt relieved that this possible threat to concentration on Operation Overlord had at last been removed.\n\nAt the end of the conference, it was decided that Turkey's neutrality should be maintained. It was also decided to build the Incirlik Air Base near Adana for possible Allied air operations in the region, but construction works began after the end of the Second World War. Incirlik Air Base later played an important role for NATO during the Cold War. Another decision was to postpone Operation Anakim against Japan in Burma.\n\nBoth Roosevelt and İnönü got what they wanted, while Churchill was a bit disappointed, because he believed that an active Turkish participation in the war would quicken the German defeat by hitting their \"soft underbelly\" in the southeast.\n\nTurkey eventually joined the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945, after it was announced at the Yalta Conference that only the states which were formally at war with Germany and Japan by 1 March 1945 would be admitted to the United Nations. However, Turkey didn't directly participate in a military conflict; limiting its participation to providing materials and supplies for the Allies, and imposing political and economic sanctions on the Axis states.\n\n\n"}

Also known in Britain as \"boys' weeklies\", story papers were phenomenally popular before the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nAmong the most well-known British story paper was \"Boy's Own Paper\", which ran from 1879 to 1967.\n\nThe first known edition of what would later become known as a \"story paper\" was \"The Young Gentleman's Magazine\", published in 1777. The first story paper to really take off was \"The Boys' and Girls' Penny Magazine\", first published in September 1832.\n\nIn 1866, Charles Stephens began selling \"Boys of England\" on the English streets for a penny—the first \"penny dreadful\". Story papers in this style minimized the expense of writing in order to produce an extremely cheap product. Strictly speaking, the \"penny dreadful\" died off by the turn of the century, but this term was still used to refer to story papers throughout their history. The \"Halfpenny Marvel\", first published in 1893, was \"founded to counteract the pernicious influences of the Penny Dreadfuls\", according to its title page. A book about these weeklies (also called \"bloods\" because of their savage contents) was created in 1948 by E. S. Turner, called \"Boys Will be Boys\".\n\nDenis Gifford designated the period between World War I and World War II as the \"Golden Age\" of story papers. Sales of the story papers were at their highest during these years, as were the fecundity of the authors, the range in genre of magazines, and the colourful variety of the heroes. The most famous story paper hero, Sexton Blake, reached his apex during these years.\n\nWorld War II caused chaos in Britain, and among other things the story papers had to be shut down as funds were redirected to the war. This is known as the \"Dark Ages\" for story papers, and nearly all of the papers ceased printing in 1939 or 1940.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, some story papers such as the \"Rover\" briefly flourished, but television had a growing influence on the attentions of British children. Mergers between publishing houses finished off the remaining story papers, or modified them to become comic books, in the 1970s. Rover was the last survivor and ceased publishing in 1973.\n\nGeorge Orwell's essay, \"Boys' Weeklies\", outlines the general themes of the story paper in the \"Golden Age\". As far as Orwell could tell, Britain was the only country in Europe in which story papers were produced. \"The Gem\" and \"The Magnet\", the oldest of their kind, featured school serials always centred on a group of characters any reader could identify with. More recent story papers focused on adventure and intrigue, and had a large teenage readership. \n\nAccording to Orwell, all of the English papers published at the time were stuck in the 1910s and had an underlying conservative slant, which taught children to be deferential to the upper-class. He suggested socialist values could be just as exciting if they followed the story paper format.\n\nThere were story papers for children of both sexes, although there was a broad overlap in the actual readership of the two.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "18937540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18937540", "title": "Technical Service Council", "text": "Technical Service Council\n\nThe Technical Service Council was set up to combat the \"brain drain\" of Canadian engineers to the United States, when over 20% of the graduating classes were emigrating. Ireland, India, New Zealand and even Switzerland have had similar problems.\n\nIn 1927, Canadian industry financed the Council, whose directors concluded that a non-profit employment service that was free to graduates might minimize emigration. The service survived the Depression, played a part in recruiting scientists and engineers for war work, pioneered outplacement and expanded to include other professional occupations. It financed major studies of the supply of and demand for engineers and offered free-job-hunting courses to professionals.\n\nAlthough started in Toronto, the Council eventually had offices in Montreal, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver before becoming bankrupt in 1994. It may have reduced the brain drain during its first 20 or 25 years, but it's not possible to judge its later record.\n\nIn the 1920s over 20% of Canadian engineering graduates emigrated to the United States. At that time, jobs in the U.S. were both much more numerous and more varied than in Canada. Meanwhile, the number of graduates soared, Canadian employers were unconvinced of the value of engineering degrees and new graduates complained of the lack of jobs.\n\nRobert A. Bryce, president of Macassa Mines Ltd. and Prof. H.E.T. Haultain of the University of Toronto resolved to act. In April 1927 they and Rev.Canon H.J. Cody, chairman of the board of governors of the University of Toronto, invited the chief executives of major firms to a dinner at the National Club in Toronto. After hearing how the loss of talent could hamper industry, each of the 12 executives promised $1,000 to fund a non-profit organization to combat the \"brain drain\". The brain drain, the selling of science to employers and Canadian nationalism were tightly intertwined ideas. The firm was called the Technical Service Council.\n\nRolsa Eric Smythe was hired to run the Council. Appropriately, he was a Canadian engineer who had been working in Detroit. (3)\n\nAfter a study of placement operations in other countries and consultation with employers, the directors decided that engineers would not respond to urges to stay in Canada. Instead the Technical Service Council would find jobs for them by operating a free (to graduates) placement service. Employers would be invited to donate to the service, although later some companies used the service without contributing.\n\nThe objectives were: To retain for Canada young Canadians educated along technical and scientific lines; to bring graduates of universities and technical institutions into practical contact with Canadian industry; to submit to universities the recommendations of industry concerning scientific courses and to aid industry in technical and scientific employment problems.\n\nA small office was opened in Toronto in 1928 with $30,000 \"seed money\" from 30 firms to finance a three-year experiment. Between July and December, 159 job hunters registered, 185 jobs were listed by employers and 81 engineers were placed by the staff of two.\n\nThe Great Depression soon arrived, wiping out many jobs. Some graduates were placed in welcome, but undemanding jobs, like street car conductor. Raising money was difficult and the Council survived only because of grants from the government of Ontario in 1932-34 and sometimes, Smythe's forgoing his salary. It was decided to ask those who had found jobs through the TSC to make donations. This produced some money, but the organization had a hand-to-mouth existence until 1957, apart from the World War II years. (3)\n\nBy June 30, 1933, over 1,180 personnel had been placed, 110 of whom were repatriated Canadians. Expenses for the first five years of operations\nwere $44,988. In 1933, 111 men and women were placed by the Council's staff of two.\n\nEven then it was clear that engineers needed business knowledge. The Council persuaded the University of Western Ontario to offer a diploma course in management for engineers. Then such a course was novel, if not unique. In 1951 numerous employers and graduates in ceramic engineering were surveyed on behalf of the University of Saskatchewan to estimate future demand. Some time later a similar survey was made for the University of Toronto. As a result of these studies, both universities discontinued their ceramic engineering programs.\n\nBy 1938, in response employers' demand for \"one-stop service\", the Council expanded to include executives, accountants, marketing, production and personnel staff. A year later, the economy had improved, but the Council's placements were mainly in Ontario and Quebec, where Canada's industry was concentrated.\n\nJob vacancies soared with the start of World War II. Shipyards, steel mills, armaments and munitions factories, aircraft manufacturers and construction companies urgently needed engineers. Few engineers even considered emigrating to the United States because of patriotic reasons and the plethora of jobs.\n\nThe Technical Service Council was the only placement service allowed to operate during the war. Its bank of professionals was such an important national resource that 15 recruiters from Defence Industries Ltd., the major munitions manufacturer, were loaned to the Council.\n\nAfter the war, veterans were entitled to free university tuition. Therefore, record numbers of engineers were graduated in 1949 and 1950. Graduates of Western and Maritime universities, both in areas with limited industry, greatly outnumbered local vacancies. Many engineers moved to Ontario, Quebec and the United States. About 2,500 professional men emigrated to the United States in 1950 alone. Nevertheless, one study showed that the exodus of technically trained graduates dropped from 27% of the graduating classes in 1927 to under 10% in 1951.\n\nPioneering work was done on group interviews and recruitment advertising in 1950-52. The latter study showed how employers could increase response to their ads. The Federal government engaged the Council to write a handbook on the job market for immigrants while the Ontario Government asked the Council to appraise opportunities for prospective immigrants from Great Britain.\n\nCanadian industry contributed more than $300,000 to the Council between 1927 and 1953. During the same period, employers listed 16,533 job vacancies. 6,817 men with special training were placed in key positions in business and industry. The Council registered and interviewed 24,607 men with higher education. The qualifications of each were carefully cross-indexed and maintained for employers. An additional 100,000 individuals were interviewed to assess qualifications and give free vocational advice. The average cost per placement rose from $50 to $100 between 1948 and 1954.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1956, 3,072 engineers, equivalent to 31% of graduating classes in engineering, emigrated to the United States. They could have staffed the largest missile centre in the Western World. In 1951 the equivalent of 11% of the graduating classes in engineering left for the United States. In 1956, as immigrants were less likely to be drafted, the percentage had soared to 46%.\n\nIn 1957 the Council almost collapsed, but it was revived by new management who increased placement fees.\n\nShortages of engineers and scientists in Canada often coincided with equally acute shortages in the United States. American companies then recruited actively in Canada, as they did following the 1959 cancellation of Canada's much-vaunted Avro Arrow jet fighter. In addition, Canadians completing post-graduate training in the U.S. often found getting a job locally easier than searching for one in distant Canada.\n\nIn 1962 a branch in Montreal called Technical Service Council/Le Conseil de Placement Professionnel was opened. It was followed by others in Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.\n\nThe Council was one of the pioneers of outplacement (then called relocation counselling) in Canada. Its first contract in 1970 eventually developed into a significant activity. In addition to individual counselling, free office services and other benefits, clients were given \"How to Job Hunt Effectively,\" a substantial hand and work book. The book was also available to the public and over 5,000 copies were sold.\n\nFrom 1967 regular one-day employment interviewing courses for line managers were run in major cities. Students received written critiques of their interviews with actors.\n\nBy 1971 out-of-work university graduates were so numerous that free \"How to Job Hunt\" courses were held in several cities. As another public service, over $200,000. was spent researching and publishing ten-year forecasts of the supply of and demand for engineering graduates in 1975 and again in 1988. Both studies were intended to improve understanding of the job market, candidate mobility and help minimize \"mismatch\". They were provided free to Canadian universities and sold at below cost to employers.\n\nIn the same year, an executive search division, Bryce, Haultain & Associates, was opened and named after two of the Council's co-founders.\n\nBy 1976 the Council had placed over 16,000 men and women. An equal number were estimated to have rejected job offers from the Council's client companies. Studies showed that 25% of job listings were never filled from any source. Employers' reasons included budget cuts, inability to find someone who filled the job specifications, candidates' high asking salaries, reorganizations and a belated realization that existing staff could do the job.\n\nIn 1976 573 firms were members. Annual membership fees were mainly $100 to $500., depending upon company size and usage. Placement fees were kept low in order to attract job listings. The greater the choice of vacancies, the more likely candidates were to stay in Canada. Placement fees for member companies were 4% to 5% of the placement's annual income. Commercial employment agencies charged 20% to 30%.\n\nOver 17,000 engineers and scientists emigrated from Canada to the United States between 1960 and 1979. The number of engineers emigrating declined from 1,209 in 1967 to only 289 in 1977, and the number of chemists emigrating dropped from 156 to 58 during the same period. However, engineers and scientists emigrating increased from 727 in 1982 to 1,433 in 1985.\n\nActive job listings reached 4,328 in June 1981,an astonishing figure for such a clearing house. Orders plummeted when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's highly controversial National Energy Program took effect. About half the Council's staff was laid off.\n\nNevertheless, between 1928 and 1988, over 46,000 men and women had received job offers from about 1,700 of the Council's employer clients.\n\nFrequent dramatic swings in the job market caused the Council to build a financial reserve equal to two times' annual operating expenses. The reserve was over three times' expenses in December, 1991, but the Council was declared bankrupt in September, 1994.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1939, job vacancies were mainly advertised locally so job hunters had difficulty learning of distant jobs. The Maritimes and West had so little industry that their substantial engineering graduating classes had to seek positions elsewhere. Employers seldom sought professionals through the Federal employment service while universities had tiny or non-existent placement services. This lack of job information made the Council's numerous industrial contacts especially important to job hunters. The exodus of technically trained Canadians is said to have dropped from 27% of graduating classes in 1927 to under 10% in 1951 and 5% in 1967.\n\nAny evaluation of the later years is difficult. The number of job vacancies and job hunters both increased. But often supply and demand were out of sync, encouraging emigration. Universities devoted more resources to placing their graduates, but often gave little attention to experienced graduates. Commercial employment agencies expanded, but few lasted five years because of the erratic job market. Eventually, one and then another national newspaper spread news of distant vacancies. Although graduates had better information than ever, the Council was still busy. Despite this, 2,500 professional men moved to the United States in 1950 alone. It is impossible to judge the Council's impact on the \"brain drain\" since then.\n\nThe Ministry of State, Science and Technology asked the Council to study the feasibility of a National Register of Canadians in research-oriented occupations who are working or studying out of the country. The study found that 65% of employers contacted had a strong or moderate interest in a register. It was estimated that only one or two per cent of candidates would find jobs through the register. Neither the register nor a free handbook on job hunting in Canada would get at the reasons why many Canadians do not return: a perceived lack of opportunities in their specialty and lack of research support in Canada.\n\nThe study noted that efforts by the Association of Medical Colleges of Canada and the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada to recruit Canadians in the U.S. had failed. In 1986 twenty British firms advertised for British-trained engineers in North America. The ads produced 6,500 replies and about 1,800 job offers. Only 89 offers were accepted at what was considered an uneconomical cost.\n\n16. Cuddihy, Basil Robert. \"How to Give Phased-out Managers a New Chance\", \"Harvard Business Review\", Vol.54, No.4.

The series portrays the life and crimes of convicted murderer Malcolm Webster. ITV described the show as: \"The Widower tells how, over a 13-year period, a seemingly mild-mannered nurse, Malcolm Webster, set about poisoning and murdering his first wife, attempting to do the same to his second wife and moving on to a further scheme to deceive his third fiancée.\" The series was written by Jim Barton and Jeff Pope.\n\nIn March 2014, ITV announced the broadcast of \"The Widower\". Webster's estranged wife Felicity Drumm, his former partner Simone Banerjee and Detective Inspector Charlie Henry (who had led the investigation that led to Webster's arrest) all contributed to the production. It was shown in New Zealand on TV One in July 2014. Webster's first wedding was reconstructed, based on a VHS recording provided by his first wife's family. Reece Shearsmith, who portrayed Webster, described him as a \"horrible, petulant little boy ... who even now believes he has been wronged, his entire life has always been poor Malcolm, poor Malcolm, with no thought for the terrible crimes and the victims that he has left in his wake.\" Malcolm Webster was not approached (although his solicitor was informed that the film was being made). Banerjee complimented Shearsmith's performance and described the production as \"99% accurate\". Drumm initially declined to comment on the series. She is said to have been reluctant to take part in the project, but felt obligated due to being financially destitute. However she later discussed the series in an interview, in which she described the show as \"strange to view\" and criticised the show for not capturing Webster's personality which she described as \"very extroverted, likable, funny, amusing person to be around, he was good company\", whereas in the film he was portrayed as \"not at all likable\", which she felt marred the show's credibility. She stated also that he would adjust his personality to a particular woman. Claire Webster's brother Peter Morris was reported as being impressed by Smith's portrayal of his sister, stating: \"Sheridan captured Claire completely. I miss that camaraderie of a sibling and I thank Sheridan for giving that back to me for a while.\"\n\n"}

His niece, Catherine Knyvet, was married to Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk. He attended Jesus College, Cambridge.\n\nHe was a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to Queen Elizabeth I, and in 1592 was made Master at Arms. He was elected Member of Parliament for Thetford in 1601.\n\nOn 21 July 1597 Knyvet married Elizabeth Hayward, the daughter of Sir Rowland Hayward and widow of Richard Warren of Claybury, Essex. He was granted the manor of Stanwell in 1603. He was knighted in 1604.\n\nKnyvet was the most active intervener in foiling the Gunpowder Plot. On the evening of 26 October 1605, the Catholic Lord Monteagle received an anonymous letter warning him to stay away from Parliament during the opening, and to \"retyre youre self into yowre contee whence yow maye expect the event in safti for ... they shall receyve a terrible blowe this parleament\". Monteagle's letter was shown to King James. The King ordered Knyvet to conduct a search of the cellars underneath Parliament, which he carried out with Edmund Doubleday in the early hours of 5 November. Guy Fawkes was arrested by Knyvet whilst leaving the cellar shortly after midnight. Inside, the barrels of gunpowder were discovered hidden under piles of firewood and coal.\n\nAfter foiling the plot Knyvet was given charge of the education of the short-lived Princess Mary. By royal grant of a peerage he entered the House of Lords as Baron Knyvet of Escrick, Yorkshire in 1607. He was appointed a Privy Councillor, Member of the Council to Queen Anne, and Warden of the Mint. In 1613, the manor of Staines was granted him outright.\n\nHe maintained a long-running feud with Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Knyvet's niece, Anne Vavasour, was the Earl's mistress, and on 21 March 1581 bore his illegitimate son, Edward Vere. On numerous occasions, servants on either side were killed. On one occasion, Knyvet injured Oxford, apparently in the leg.\n\nWhen Lord Knyvet died in July 1622 his will provided for the foundation of a free-school in Stanwell — the Lord Knyvet School was founded in 1624. An effigy of him and his wife features in the chancel of Stanwell's St Mary's parish church.\n\nKnyvet occupied as his London townhouse the first house known on the site of 10 Downing Street, the modern-day residence of the British Prime Minister, in a large timber and brick building with an L-shaped garden. It was first leased to him in 1581 by Queen Elizabeth I at which point it became known as Knyvet House, and his lifetime lease was extended in 1604 to extend to his heirs. The house was described by the parliamentary commissioners in 1650 as:\n\nThe house passed to his niece, Elizabeth Hampden, in whose lifetime, whether purposefully it adopted her surname and whose nephew was Oliver Cromwell. After the lease expired on Hampden House and garden in 1682, George Downing redeveloped the site and adjoining premises.\n"}
{"id": "47131361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47131361", "title": "Triplemanía XXIII", "text": "Triplemanía XXIII\n\nTriplemanía XXIII was a professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) produced by the Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) promotion. It took place on August 9, 2015, at Arena Ciudad de México in Mexico City, Mexico. The event was the twenty-third year in a row that AAA has held a Triplemanía show, and was the thirtieth show held under the Triplemanía name since 1993 as AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows some years. The annual Triplemanía show is AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event.\n\nThe main event was billed as a \"Dream match\" between two of the biggest names in \"lucha libre\", a singles match between Rey Mysterio Jr. and Myzteziz. A second match, a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" \"hair vs. hair\" match between El Patrón Alberto and Brian Cage was confirmed at the AAA television taping on July 10. The show was the final mach of \"lucha libre\" legend Villano III as he teamed up with his brothers Villano IV and Villano V to take on \"Los Psycho Circus\" and three additional matches. The show received very negative reviews both due to technical difficulties throughout the show and the quality of several of the matches on the show.\n\n2015 marked the 23rd year since 1993 where the Mexican professional wrestling company Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA) held their annual Triplemanía show and the thirtieth Triplemanía show promoted by AAA as they held multiple Triplemanía shows over the summers of 1994 to 1997. The event took place at the Arena Ciudad de México (Mexico City Arena) an indoor arena in Azcapotzalco, Mexico City, Mexico that has a maximum capacity of 22,300 spectators. AAA previously held Triplemanía XX, Triplemanía XXI and Triplemanía XXII having held Triplemanía at the arena since its completion in 2012. AAA's Triplemanía is their biggest show of the year, the highlight of their year, AAA's equivalence of the WWE's WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event.\n\nThe Triplemanía XXIII show featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. On July 1, 2015, AAA Vice President Dorian Roldán announced via Twitter that the 23rd annual Triplemanía show would be held on August 9 in Arena Ciudad de México in Mexico City, Mexico. The show was announced as being available on Internet pay-per-view both in and outside of Mexico. On July 22, it was announced that the event would also be available on cable and satellite PPV in the United States and Canada, making it the first AAA event to air live on American PPV since When Worlds Collide in 1994.\nEver since Myzteziz (then known as Místico) rise in popularity early in the 21st century parallels were drawn between \"El Principe de Oro y Plata\" (\"The Prince of Gold and Silver\") and Rey Mysterio Jr. both in regards to their ring style, skill level and popularity. Myzteziz would become the most popular \"Luchador\" in Mexico during the first decade of the 21st century while Rey Mysterio would become the most popular \"luchador\" outside of Mexico in the same time period. When Myzteziz joined the WWE under the name Sin Cara in 2011, the idea that the two could face off became a possibility. By mid-2012 wrestling magazine and news websites reported rumors of a Rey Mysterio/Sin Cara possibly taking place at WrestleMania 28 but due to injuries to Rey Mysterio the match did not happen. When Mysterio returned from his injuries in later 2012 he began teaming with Sin Cara on a regular basis, leading once again to speculations that the two might wrestle each other at WrestleMania 29, possibly in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match with their masks on the line. The duo teamed regularly throughout the second half of 2012, including a tournament to determine the #1 contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship, a tournament that Rey Mysterio and Sin Cara lost in the finals to \"The Rhodes Scholars\" (Cody Rhodes and Damian Sandow) at the 2012 pay-per-view. In the wake of their loss rumors of a WrestleMania 29 match arose again, this time with the added rumors that the WWE wanted to use the match to set a record for the most masked fans in one location as well as transitioning the role of the WWE's top Latino wrestler from Rey Mysterio to Sin Cara. Unfortunately Mysterio was forced to take time off once again in March 2013 due to another knee injury. At this point in time it was reported that Rey Mysterio did not intend to sign another contract with the WWE, putting an end to the rumored Rey Mysterio vs Sin Cara match for the time being. In 2014 Sin Cara left the WWE and began working for AAA in Mexico under the name Myzteziz. In February 2015 the WWE announced that Rey Mysterio's contract had expired. A few days later it was announced that he had signed with AAA and would team up with Myzteziz in the main event of the 2015 Rey de Reyes (\"King of Kings\") show against El Hijo del Perro Aguayo and Pentagón Jr., a match that the reunited team of Mysterio and Myzteziz won when Mysterio Jr. scored the pin. On May 24, 2015 Myzteziz, Rey Mysterio Jr. and El Patrón Alberto formed a \"Dream team\" to win the Lucha Libre World Cup. On July 10, 2015 AAA announced that the \"dream match\" between Rey Mysterio Jr. and Myzteziz would finally take place and that it would be the main event of Triplemanía XXIII.\nIn early 2015 AAA Mega Champion El Patrón Alberto found himself with an American \"invader\" challenging him in the form of Brian Cage, who had worked indirectly for AAA through Lucha Underground up until that point. Cage was immediately positioned as a challenger for El Patrón as he, El Hijo de Fantasma and Pentagón Jr. defeated El Patrón Alberto, Fénix and Myzteziz in his AAA debut match on February 27 when Cage pinned Alberto. El Patrón was scheduled to defend the Mega Championship against Cage as part of the 2015 Rey de Reyes show slated for March 15. however, when Guadalajara was hit with a rainstorm, AAA postponed the event for 24 hours and moved it indoors to \"Auditorio Benito Juarez\" in Zapopan, Jalisco. The following day AAA announced that they were not able to get all permits in time for the show due to it being it being a national holiday, and once again postponed the show to Wednesday March 18 instead. At the same time they announced that the announced match between El Patrón Alberto and Brian Cage had been cancelled. El Patrón Alberto later stated that he was legally obligated to compete in Australia later in the week and thus was not able to work the Wednesday show for AAA. On April 1 Cage defeated El Patrón in a Street Fight after members of \"La Sociedad\" interfered in the match to help Cage win the match, after which Cage once again challenged El Patrón to the title match he never received. A few weeks later the two faced off again in a one-on-one match, but this time it ended in a no-contest after interference from Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria, which then brough out Jack Evans and Angélico turning it into a six-man tag team match that El Patrón, Evans and Angélico won when El Patrón pinned Cage. The two rivals found themselves on opposite sides in the Lucha Libre World Cup, with the \"Dream team\" of El Patrón, Rey Mysterio Jr. and Myzteziz defeated the team of Cage and Ring of Honor representatives Moose and ACH in the second round of the tournament. El Patrón was finally able to defend the Mega Championship against Cage at AAA's 2015 Verano de Escándalo show. The match saw interference from Cage's corner man El Texano Jr. as well as the \"rudo\" referee El Hijo del Tirantes favoring Cage throughout the match to stack the odds against El Patrón in the end a second, impartial referee came to the ring and declared a disqualification, leaving the issues between the two unresolved. After the match an enraged El Patrón Alberto laid out a challenge for a \"Lucha de Apuestas\" match against Cage, stating that he did not care if he had to put his title on the line, wrestle in a steel cage or whatever it would take to get Cage to put his hair on the line in a match. Next AAA paired up El Patrón and Cage to fight against Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV in a \"Pareja Increibles\" (\"Incredible pairs\") match, forcing two sets of rivals to team up for a match. As expected El Patrón and Cage were not able to get along, with Cage attacking El Patrón and throwing him through a table at ringside to allow Blue Demon Jr. and Villano IV to win the match. On the AAA television taping on July 10, 2015 Cage accepted the \"Lucha de Apuestas\" challenge made repeatedly by El Patrón Alberto. During the English language \"Triplemanía XXIII Countdown Special\" it was revealed that Alberto had stated that if he lost to Brian Cage he would leave AAA.\n\nOn June 26 Goya Kong left Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and joined AAA instead, being introduced to the AAA crowd by her brother, Psycho Clown, before the match. After the match Villano IV interrupted the celebrations, claiming that his family, the Mendoza family, also known as \"La Dinastia Imperial\" (\"The Imperial Dynasty\"; Villano and his brothers) was better than the Alvarado family that both Goya Kong and Psycho Clown belonged to. Villano IV's claim was built on the decade long rivalry between various members of \"Los Villano\", including a match where Villano I, IV and Villano V defeated Brazo de Plata (Goya Kong and Psycho Clown's father), Brazo de Oro and El Brazo to unmask the trio back in 1988. Following the match Psycho Clown stated that the Alvarado family was always ready to fight and would be happy to face either Villano IV on his own or any member of the Villano family in the ring. On July 18, 2015 AAA announced that \"Los Psycho Circus\", Psycho Clown, Murder Clown and Monster Clown would face the trio of Villano III, IV and V at Triplemanía. The match was promoted as both another chapter in the Alvarado/Mendoza family feud as well as Villano III's retirement match after 45 years as a wrestler. On July 24, 2015 AAA announced that the event would also be the farewell to referee Pepe \"Tropi\" Casas who had worked for AAA since its inception in 1992.\n\nAAA announced that to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the debut of Blue Demon Jr. on July 26, 1985 AAA booked Demon Jr. in a tag team match where he would team up with La Parka to face off against El Mesias and Electroshock as part of the 23rd Triplemanía event. While there was no ongoing storyline at the time of the match being announced the four wrestlers were no strangers to each other, with them all facing off at Triplemanía XXII in a six-man steel cage match where the last man in the cage would be shaved bald. The mach also included Averno and Chessman and ended with El Mesias being the last to escape the cage, forcing Electroshock to have his hair shaved off. The AAA preview for the match did point out that a year ago El Mesias and Electroshock were both \"tecnicos\" and on the same side until the end of the cage match.\n\nOn June 14, 2015 \"Los Hell Brothers\" (Averno, Chessman and Cibernético) defeated \"Los Psycho Circus\" and \"Holocausto\" (Electroshock, El Hijo de Pirata Morgan and La Parka Negra) to win the AAA World Trios Championship as part of the 2015 Verano de Escándalo (\"Summer of Scandal\") show. On July 28, 2015 AAA Announced that \"Los Hell Brothers\" would face off against \"Los Güeros del Cielo\" (\"The Sky Blondes\"; Angélico and Jack Evans) teaming with Fénix as well as the trio of El Hijo del Fantasma, El Texano Jr. and Pentagón Jr. as they defend the AAA World Trios Championship at Triplemanía. Prior to the show Fénix and \"Los Güeros del Cielo\" had not teamed up on a regular basis while Hijo del Fantasma, Texano Jr. and Pentagón Jr. had all been members of the group \"Los Perros del Mal\" and teamed together on occasion. With the death of El Hijo del Perro Aguayo earlier in 2015 the future of \"Los Perros del Mal\" under that name was in question and while not officially announced as \"Los Perros del Mal\" they kept wearing the \"Perros del Mal\" shirts. At the time of the announcement El Hijo del Fantasma held the AAA World Cruiserweight Championship while Pentagón Jr. was one half of both the AAA World Tag Team Championship team (with Joe Lider) and the AAA World Mixed Tag Team Championship (with Sexy Star).\n\nAAA has traditionally included a \"Relevos Atómicos de Locura\", or \"Atomic Madness\" match as part of their major shows for years as a homage to AAA founder Antonio Peña who created the concept years prior. In a \"Relevos Atómicos de Locura\" match each team represents the four distinct type of wrestlers that work for AAA, Male, Female, \"Mini-Estrella\" and \"Exótico\". While the match is a mixed-gender match there are no rules to limit the interaction between the teams so males wrestle females, \"Mini-Estrellas\" wrestle \"Exótico\" and so on. For the 2015 show AAA paired up Drago (male), Goya Kong (female), Dinastía (\"Mini-Estrella\" and AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion) and Pimpinela Escarlata (\"Exótico\") on the \"'tecnico\" side to take on Daga (male), Sexy Star (female), Mini Psycho Clown (\"Mini-Estrella\") and Mamba (\"Exótico\"). The two \"Exótico\" had fought on opposite sides of various \"Relevos Atómicos de Locura\" matches for years, as far back as the 2014 Rey de Reyes (\"King of Kings\"). Goya Kong had only recently joined AAA making the Triplemanía XXIII her first major AAA appearance. Dinastía and Mini Psycho Clown had been working a long-running storyline prior to the show, including Dinastía successfully defending the AAA World Mini-Estrellas Championship against Mini Psycho Clown on June 28, 2015.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to Triplemanía XXIII AAA announced their intentions to induct El Hijo del Perro Aguayo (The Son of Perro Aguayo) , sometimes referred to as \"Perro Aguayo Jr.\" into their Hall of Fame at Triplemanía. Aguayo made his professional wrestling debut on June 18, 1995 at Triplemanía III-B. Having worked for AAA's biggest rival Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) for years El Hijo del Perro Aguayo returned to AAA 2010 at Triplemanía XVIII leading his \"Los Perros del Mal\" group in an invasion storyline. Over the following years Aguayo Jr. was one of AAA's top \"rudo\" workers. During a match on March 20, 2015, Aguayo hit the ring ropes wrong after a drop kick from Rey Mysterio Jr. and later died from the injuries suffered during the match.\n\nOn August 6, AAA announced Héctor Garza as the second Hall of Fame inductee in the class of 2015.\n\nThe English language broadcast of Triplemanía XXIII experienced extended periods of time with audio problems, at times neither of the commentators were heard, at other times only Matt Striker could be heard and at one point there was a prolonged buzzing sound on the English language broadcast. It has not been confirmed if the Spanish language broadcast suffered from the same audio issues. The broadcast also suffered from some video issues especially early in the fourth match of the night involving Blue Demon Jr., La Parka, Electroshock and Mesisas. The Triplemanía XXIII stage set resembled the nose of a large cargo plane with wrestlers walking down steps through an opening in the front of the plan, then proceeding down what was described as the \"\" runway, a ramp that resembled an airport runway.\n\nFor his entrance prior to the main event Myzteziz was lowered from the ceiling wearing a harness, holding a pose similar to that of Ethan Hunt (portrayed by Tom Cruise) from the first \"Mission Impossible\" movie. Once he landed on the ground and was unhooked he revealed a half black/half white version of his normal wrestling gear, alluding to comments made prior to the show that he may or may not work as a \"tecnico\" for the match. Initially Rey Mysterio Jr. took control of the match, much to Myzteziz's frustration, with Myzteziz only gaining control of the match by using punches, kicks and other \"rudo\" tactics. This drew boos from the crowd as they were vocally behind Rey Mysterio Jr. At one point during the match Myzteziz slammed Rey Mysterio Jr. onto of the English Language commentator's table, and at another point he suplexed Mysterio Jr. out of the ring, through a table. At one point Rey Mysterio Jr. threw Myzteziz into one of the ring posts, making it look like Myzteziz hit his head on the metal. While the cameras were focusing on Rey Mysterio Jr. Myzteziz made it look like the impact had cut his forehead open as blood (or a similar red substance) covered the white portion of his mask. Once the two wrestlers returned to the ring Rey Mysterio Jr. started to tear at Myzteziz's mask, tearing it open around the eye holds. Late in the match Rey Mysterio Jr. managed to apply Myzteziz's finishing hold, the \"La Mistica\" Fujiwara armbar, on Myzteziz but did not gain a submission from the move. Later on Mysterio Jr. managed to apply \"La Mistica\" once more, this time with Myzteziz being forced to tap out. As Mysterio Jr. celebrated on the floor Averno, Pentagón Jr. and Joe Lider ran to the ring to attack Myzteziz while he was down. When Rey Mysterio Jr. noticed the attack he entered the ring and helped Myzteziz fight off the \"rudo\" trios. When Mysterio Jr. offered a handshake Myzteziz spit a liquid in Mysterio's eyes and then declared that he did not care about the fans or Rey Mysterio Jr. He later challenged Mysterio to put his mask on the line in a \"Luchas de Apuestas\" match. As the show went off the air Myzteziz declined to join Konnan's \"La Sociedad\", stating he was on his own.\n\nIn the minutes after the PPV ended \"Lucha Libre\" journalist Apolo Valdés, who writes for the sports website \"MedioTiempo\" commented on Twitter that he really did not like the show, he only liked the cage match. Josh Boutwell, reviewing the show for wrestleview stated the second match of the night involving \"Los Villanos\" was a \"trainwreck\". He also noted that the \"Apuestas\" match was \"awesome\" and that the main event was a great match despite a couple of clunky spots.\" He also noted that the PPV broadcast suffered from several technical issues, primarily with the sound on the English commentary and occasionally also issues with the picture quality. In the end he gave the Mysterio/Myzteziz match four stars out of five and rated the entire show as a \"C+\". James Caldewell of the Pro Wrestling Torch noted that the cage match \"felt disorganized with so many people involved and a lot of standing around\". Following the conclusion of the main event he commented that \"more aimed at the live audience than translating to PPV\". His final conclusion was \" Not a recommended PPV. The last two matches had star-power and stories to carry the event once the technical difficulties were worked out, but the live atmosphere and significance of the event just did not seem to translate to PPV\". Richard Gallegos, when writing an editorial for \"SuperLuchas\" Magazine, called Triplemanía XXIII \"a disaster\", both due to technical issues but also due to the fact that they were presenting a show to the US audience which have very little back story or build to four of the six matches, citing the \"Los Villanos\"/\"Los Psycho Circus\" match as one of the worst matches of the year. Summarizing he called it a \"terrible experience\" and that the production crew was a \"monumental failure. Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" called the event \"one of the worst PPV shows of all-time\", stating \"[t]his was a misfire to the level it's probably best for them to regroup and not try this again for some time\". He gave the \"Los Villanos\"/\"Los Psycho Circus\" match a \"minus five star\" rating, calling it \"one of the worst matches [he had] ever seen\". He gave the main event three and three quarter stars out of five, his highest rating of the night. Meltzer, who had been approached by AAA to work as part of the English announcing team for the event, also stated that while he had sympathy for the announcers for the technical issues, he would not want them back, calling Matt Striker \"terrible throughout\" and stating that Hugo Savinovich was \"off his game\" in regard to clueing fans in on the storylines behind the matches. Readers of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" voted the match between \"Los Psycho Circus\" and \"Los Villanos\" the 2015 Worst Match of the Year and the entire event as the Worst Major Wrestling Show.\n"}

{"id": "13669170", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13669170", "title": "World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia", "text": "World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia\n\nWorld War II in Yugoslav Macedonia started with the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia. Macedonian communist Partisans of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia, part of the Yugoslav Partisan movement, started a political and military campaign on 11 October 1941 to resist the occupation of Vardar Macedonia by Bulgarian, German, Italian, and Albanian forces. Officially, the area was called then Vardar Banovina, because the very name \"Macedonia\" was prohibited in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. \n\nInitially it had no real success, starting to grow only in 1943 with the capitulation of Italy and the Soviet victories over Nazi Germany. The role of the Bulgarian communists, which avoided organizing mass armed resistance, was also a key factor. Their influence over the Macedonian Party organization remained dominant until the spring of 1943 when Tito's special emissary Svetozar Vukmanović arrived in Macedonia. This led to the rise of younger generation anti-Bulgarian oriented partisan leaders, who were loyal to Yugoslavia. In the western part of the area, the Albanian Partisans also participated in the resistance movement.\n\nAfter Bulgaria switched sides in the war in September 1944, the Bulgarian 5th. Army stationed in Macedonia, moved back to the old borders of Bulgaria. In the early October the newly formed Bulgarian People's Army together with the Red Army reentered occupied Yugoslavia to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. Vardar Macedonia was liberated in end of November when communist Yugoslavia was established. \n\nThe operation was called the National Liberation War of Macedonia () by the Partisans, in line with the greater Yugoslav People's Liberation War, but combatants also developed further aspirations over the geographic region of Macedonia. It marked the defeat of Bulgarian nationalism and the victory of Macedonism in the area.\n\nThe Balkan Wars in 1912 and 1913, and the World War I (1914-1918) divided the region of Macedonia amongst the Kingdom of Greece, the Kingdom of Bulgaria and the Kingdom of Serbia. The territory was up until that time part of the Ottoman Empire. In those days, the majority of the Slavic speakers in Ottoman Macedonia considered themselves to be a part of the Bulgarian people.\n\nFrom 1912 until 1915 the territory of Vardar Macedonia remained within the territory of Serbia. In the parts administred by Serbia the new authorities forced out most of the Bulgarian priests and teachers, and began implementing a forceful state-sponsored Serbianisation of Slavic-speaking Macedonians. It was occupied by Kingdom of Bulgaria during World War I between 1915 and 1918. Afterwards it was restored back to Serbia and consequently included as part of the Vardar Banovina in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During that period, there were two main autonomist agendas. The right-wing Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) led by Ivan Mihailov, was in favor of the creation of a pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state under German and Italian protection.\n\nThe leftist IMRO (United) group, who merged with the communists prior to the beginning of the war, favored creation of an independent \"Soviet Macedonia\" within a Balkan Federation. This option was supported by Pavel Shatev, Dimitar Vlahov, Metodi Shatorov, Panko Brashnarov, and others. However such Macedonian activists, who came from the Bulgarian Communist Party, never managed to get rid of their pro-Bulgarian bias.\n\nDuring the interwar period in Vardar Macedonia, some young locals repressed by the Serbs, tried to find a separate Macedonian way of national development. Nevertheless, the existence of considerable Macedonian national consciousness prior to the middle of 1940s is disputed. At that time anti-Serbian and pro-Bulgarian feelings among the local population prevailed.\n\nFearing an invasion of the World War II Axis Powers, Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941, pledging cooperation with the Axis.\n\nOn 27 March, the regime of Prince Paul was overthrown by a military coup d'état with British support. The 17-year-old Peter II of Yugoslavia was declared to be of age and placed in power. General Dušan Simović became his Prime Minister. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia withdrew its support for the Axis \"de facto\" without formally renouncing the Pact. On 6 April 1941 the German armed forces (\"Wehrmacht\") launched the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and quickly conquered it.\n\nA division of Vardar Macedonia then part of so called Vardar Banovina was drawn up on 19 and 20 April 1941. Bulgarian troops entered the central and eastern parts and seized most of the banovina, including parts of Eastern Sebia and of today Kosovo. The prominent force which occupied most of the area was the 5th Army. The westernmost parts of Macedonia were occupied by the fascist Kingdom of Italy.\n\nBulgarian action committees – After the defeat of the Yugoslav army, a group of Macedonian Bulgarians headed by Spiro Kitincev arrived in Macedonia and started preparations for the coming of the Bulgarian army and administration in Macedonia. The first of the Bulgarian Action Committees was formed in Skopje on 13 April 1941. Former IMRO members in Vardar Macedonia were active members of this committee. On 13 April 1941, at a meeting in Skopje, it was decided that one of the first tasks of the newly formed organisation was to regulate the relations with the German authorities. When the Bulgarian Army entered Vardar Macedonia on 19 April 1941, they were greeted by most of the local population as liberators, as anti-Serbian and pro-Bulgarian feelings among the local population prevailed at that time. With the intercession of the committees and Bulgarian administration more than 12,000 Yugoslav Macedonian POWs who had been conscripted into the Yugoslav army were released by German, Italian and Hungarian authorities. With the arrival of the Bulgarian army mass expulsion of Serbian colonists from Vardar Macedonia took place. Once the region and administration became organized, the Action Committees became marginalized, and were ultimately dissolved.\n\nBalli Kombëtar in Macedonia – There were 5,500 Balli Kombëtar militants in Albanian occupied Macedonia, 2,000 of which were Tetovo-based and 500 of which were based in Debar.\n\nIvan Mihailov's IMRO in Macedonia – After the military Bulgarian coup d'état of 1934 the new Bulgarian government banned IMRO as a terrorist organization. Ivan Mihailov fled to Italy, where he made contact with the Italian fascist authorities and with members of the German secret service (Gestapo). After the defeat of Yugoslavia, Mihailov went to Zagreb and spent the war there with Ante Pavelić. He revitalized parts of his old organisation and ordered them to enter Vardar Macedonia and infiltrate the local Bulgarian administration, waiting for an opportunity to take over control and create a pro-German Macedonian state. Although Nazi Germany gave Bulgaria the right to annex the greater part of Vardar Macedonia, the Gestapo had contacts with Mihailov and his men in Bulgaria and Vardar Macedonia. This was in order to have a \"reserve card\" in case of things going wrong in Bulgaria.\n\nSerbian Chetnik Movement in Macedonia – There were approximately 8,000 Serb Chetniks led by Draža Mihailović operating in Macedonia during the conflict. For a time, they were controlled by rival Chetnik leader Kosta Pećanac.\n\nCounter-chetas – The Kontračeti were anti-partisan units organized and equipped by the Bulgarian police in the period between 1942 and 1944. Composed of former IMRO-activists, the first kontračeta was formed in Veles in the end of 1942 in order to limit partisan and Serbian Chetnik Movement activities in the region. The idea for the formation of these units came from Stefan Simeonov, chief of the Police in Skopje district, and vormer Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation četnik, and was approved by minister of the interior Petur Gabrovski. Their peak strength was 200 units in August 1944.\n\nIn 1941 the regional committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (RC of CPY) for Vardar Macedonia was headed by Metodi Shatorov (\"Sharlo\") from Prilep. After the Bulgarian takeover of Vardarska Banovina in April 1941, the Macedonian communists fell in the sphere of influence of the BCP under Sharlo's leadership. When the directive for the organization of an armed resistance movement in all regions of occupied Yugoslavia was issued, Sharlo disobeyed the order. Sharlo answered the Central Committee (CC) of the CPY that the situation in Macedonia did not allow an immediate engagement with military action, but rather first propaganda activity should occur, and afterward formation of military units. On the other hand, he refused to define the Bulgarian forces as occupiers (contrary to instructions from Belgrade) and called for the incorporation of the local Macedonian Communist organizations into the Bulgarian Communist Party (BCP). The Macedonian Regional Committee refused to remain in contact with CPY and linked up with BCP. Sharlo refused to distribute a proclamation of the YCP which called for military action against Bulgarians.\n\nAt that time, the Comintern had a different agenda for the resolution of the fate of Macedonia – an independent Macedonian state governed by a majority population of ethnic Macedonians. This idea was confirmed by the Resolution of the Comintern from 1934, and was supported by the BCP, the Communist Party of Greece (CPG), and the CPY. In 1939 the CPY started promoting the idea of formation of a Macedonian state, but within a Yugoslav federation. Shatorov was opposed to the second option and was a partisan of the Comintern agenda, which proposed a creation of a \"Soviet Macedonia\". While the Bulgarian Communists avoided organizing mass armed uprising against the Bulgarian authorities, the Yugoslav Communists insisted that no liberation could be achieved without an armed revolt.\n\nBecause of this conflict within the RC of CPY in Macedonia, in Vardar Macedonia there was no resistance movement. At the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of non-intervention, arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes. But when the USSR was attacked by Nazi Germany, the Comintern issued a directive ordering the beginning of communist resistance movements in all fascist occupied territories in Europe, so the RC of CPY for Macedonia began organizing resistance in their area. The RC, headed by Shatorov, immediately ordered the formation of partisan units, the first of which was formed in the Skopje region on 22 August 1941, and attacked Bulgarian guards on 8 September 1941 in Bogomila, near Skopje. At that time, with the help of the Comintern and of Joseph Stalin himself a decision was taken and the Macedonian Communists were attached to CPY. Soon after this Shatorov lost his popularity within the CPY and was discredited.\n\nPeople loyal to the CPY were next appointed as leaders of the RC with Lazar Koliševski as a secretary. He was sent in September in Skopje. The new leadership began formation of partisan detachments. Armed insurgents from the Prilep Partisan Detachment attacked Axis occupied zones in the city of Prilep, notably a Bulgarian police station, on 11 October 1941. This date is considered to be the symbolic beginning of the Macedonian Resistance. The Prilep detachment was active until December 1941, when it split in three groups – the first in Skopje, the second in Tikves, and the third in Bitola. However, in November the new leader of the RC - Koliševski was arrested and sentenced to death by a Bulgarian military court. He wrote two appeals for clemency to Bulgarian Tsar and to Defense Minister, insisting on his Bulgarian origin. As result his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and Koliševski was send to a prison in Pleven, Bulgaria.\n\nWhile the Sharlo's leadership was terminated, the vestiges of his policy among part of the local communist activists were preserved. After the arrest of Lazar Koliševski in November, the new executive body of the Macedonian Regional Committee continued to share Shatorov's pro-Bulgarian ideas and re-established close contact with the BCP. Bane Andreev of Veles, a new party secretary for Macedonia, expressed this same ideology. He thought that the Macedonian people believe in Bulgaria's role as liberator and that no Macedonian wants to fight against the Bulgarian soldiers. That the Macedonians should respond positively to the mobilization call being carried out by the Bulgarian authorities and join the Bulgarian army. Tito did not agree with that. During the spring of 1942 Andreev was arrested by Bulgarian police. As a result, a factionalist struggle between the pro-Bulgarian and the pro-Yugoslav lines exacerbated. Thus Cvetko Uzunovski created a provisional regional committee that tried to take over the pro-Bulgarian faction, but without much success. This policy changed since 1943 with the arrival of the Tito's envoy Montenegrin Serb Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo.\n\nIn the beginning of 1942, several new Partisan detachments were formed. In May 1942 in the village of Lisec, the Veles partisan detachment \"Pere Toshev\" was formed. It had three successful battles against the Bulgarian police: on Mount Lisec, in Kriva Krusha, and Vojnica. In July this detachment merged with the newly formed 2nd Prilep detachment under the name \"Dimitar Vlahov\". The detachment had several successful battles on Mount Mukos. In November 1942 in Crveni Steni near Prilep, the 3rd Prilep detachment \"Gjorce Petrov\" was formed.\n\nOn 22 April 1942 in the village of Lavci, near Bitola, the \"Pelister\" detachment was formed. It was involved in several battles against the Bulgarians, but in November it was dispersed as the result of a battle against a much stronger Bulgarian army and police force near Orehovo, when 2/3 of its forces were killed. On 6 June 1942 in the village of Zlatari on Bigla Mountain, the Bitola-Prespa partisan detachment \"Dame Gruev\" was formed. This unit engaged in some very successful political agitation and had several military successes, such as an attack on the troops in the village of Smilevo on 2 August 1942, and an attack on the police station in Kažani. In November 1942, the detachment split in three groups – the first remained on Bigla, the second went to northern Prespa, and the third went to southern Prespa. The third group of the \"Dame Gruev\" detachment mobilized men from the ethnic Macedonian villages in Mala Prespa and succeeded in liberating territory in Mala Prespa and part of Greek Prespa. This was the first territory liberated by Macedonian partisans during the war.\n\nOn 16 April 1942 the Krushevo detachment \"Pitu Guli\" was formed which waged several battles against the Bulgarian army and police, the most important of which were the battles in Pribilci, Kocishte and Cer. In September 1942 the 2nd Bitola detachment \"Jane Sandanski\" was formed. The fighters of this detachment conducted political speeches in the villages and made sneak attacks on Bulgarian troops such as an attack on the railway station in Beranci in December 1942. In October 1942 the \"Shar Planina\" partisan detachment was formed near Tetovo out of Macedonian and Albanian communists. This detachment had success promoting Brotherhood and Unity among the people in Tetovo. In 1942, in the village of Mavrovo, the \"Mavrovo\" partisan detachment was formed.\n\nIn 1942 a group of young communists from Shtip assembled on Plackovica Mountain in order to form a detachment, but the group was located and destroyed by the Bulgarian police before they could receive their weapons. Groups of communists that were planning to form partisan detachments were arrested due to informants in Strumica and Kočani. The successful actions of the Bulgarian secret police prevented the creation of partisan units in eastern Macedonia in 1942.\n\nPartisan activity was coordinated by the Headquarters of the National Liberation Partisan Detachments of Macedonia (HQ of NLPDM), which was established in July 1942 by Macedonian communists of the CPY and was headed by Mihailo Apostolski.\n\nAlthough several Macedonian partisan detachments were formed through the end of 1942 which fought battles against the Bulgarian, Italian, German and Albanian occupation forces and despite Sofia's ill-managed administration, most Macedonian Communists had yet to be lured to Yugoslavia. Between 1941 and 1943, Tito have sent five emissaries to Macedonia, to persuade his ill-disciplined comrades, but their efforts had limited success, and the Regional Committee was de facto under the control of the BCP. To change that, in the beginning of 1943 the Montenegrin Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo was sent as an assistant to the HQ of the Macedonian partisan forces. Tempo tried to organize an energetic struggle against the occupying forces. He was supposed to set up a Macedonian Communist Party within the framework of the Yugoslav one. One of his objectives was to destroy the influence of the BCP in Macedonia and to fight against any form of autonomism. He would have to \"Macedonianize\" the struggle’s form and content, and to give it an ethnic Macedonian facade. One of his main achievements was also that the wartime pro-Bulgarian trend receded into the background of pro-Yugoslav one. Kolisevski was able to capitalize on the growing contradictions towards Bulgarian authorities, which during 1942 were involved into a policy of centralization, contradicting their initial agenda to respect Macedonian autonomy. Yugoslav communists proclaimed as their aim the issue of unification of the three regions of Macedonia – Yugoslav, Greek and Bulgarian, and so managed to get also Macedonian nationalists.\n\nThe leadership of the Regional Committee of the CPY for Macedonia decided to establish a separate Macedonian Communist Party which would be representative of the will of the Macedonian people in the anti-fascist struggle for national liberation. The Communist Party of Macedonia (CPM) was formed on 19 March 1943 in Tetovo. The first Central Committee (CC of the CPM) was composed as of Yugoslav communists as Strahil Gigov, Kuzman Josifovski Pitu, Cvetko Uzunovski, Mara Naceva and Bane Andreev.\n\nAfter making a detailed analysis of the military and political situation in the country, the CC of the CPM decided to be directly involved in the fighting and to be stationed side by side with the troops on the battlefield. The territory of Vardar Macedonia was divided into five operative zones, and efforts were made to make direct contact with the liberation movements in Albania, Bulgaria and Greece.\n\nAdding to the existing eleven, eight new Macedonian partisan detachments were formed in the summer of 1943 as more and more people entered the ranks of the partisans. They managed to create strongholds in the regions of Debarca, Prespa, Kumanovo, Tikvesh, and Gevgelija. This allowed for the expansion of the National Liberation Committees and the creation of larger military units, as decided at a conference in Prespa on 2 August 1943. Regular large military units (battalions and brigades) were created as part of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia (MNOV). Preparations began for the formation of the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM), which governed Macedonia from August 1944 until the end of World War II.\n\nCreation of larger Macedonian military units started immediately after the Prespa conference. The first one to be created was the \"Mirče Acev\" Battalion, which was formed on 18 August 1943 on Mount Slavej. On 24 September 1943 on Mount Kožuf the battalion \"Straso Pindzur\" was formed, on 30 September the \"Debar Youth\" battalion, on 11 November near Bitola the \"Stiv Naumov\" battalion, and on 1 December the Kumanovo battalion \"Orce Nikolov\".\n\nOn 8 September Italy capitulated. Italian garrisons disarmed by the MNOV included those in Gostivar, Debar, Kicevo and Ljubojno. Some were attacked by units of the MNOV while they were trying to reach the Albanian border and flee Macedonia. The arms and ammunition that were captured gave the opportunity to create new battalions and even brigades. After the disarming of the Italians, a vast territory was liberated which stretched from Gostivar to the north of Struga and Ohrid. The freed territory included the towns Debar and Kicevo.\n\nIn the freed territories a provisional people's authority was established, led by the National Liberation Committees. Meetings were being held everywhere propagating the causes of the National Liberation Struggle and the right of Macedonians and other nationalities to self-determination. The first schools in which the Macedonian language was taught were created in this free territory in 1943. The whole population, both male and female, was included in the struggle – the men were mobilized in militias and were given short military training and the women were organized in the Women's Antifascist Front of Macedonia).\nIn October 1943 the HQ of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia issued a manifesto to the Macedonian people and all other nationalities in Macedonia (as stated in the manifesto: Aromanians, Albanians and Turks) to join the fight of the Macedonian National Liberation Army to win freedom and create a free Socialist Republic of Macedonia. The manifesto also called for struggle against the reactionary Serbian, Albanian and Bulgarian elements (Chetniks, Balli Kombëtar and IMRO agents).\n\nDuring the Summer of 1943, meetings were held between representatives of the National Liberation Front (Greece) and the Albanian resistance. Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo put forward the idea of a joint Balkan Headquarters to exercise supreme control over the partisan movements in Yugoslavia, Albania, Bulgaria, and Greece. Tempo asked for recognition of the ethnic Macedonian people's right to self-determination, as well as permission for the partisans from Vardar Macedonia to extend their activity among the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia. As a result, the Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front (SNOF) was established in 1943 in Greek Macedonia by ethnic Macedonian communists, members of the Communist Party of Greece (KKE).\n\nOn 11 November 1943 in the village of Slivovo the First Macedonian-Kosovo Brigade was formed out of three Macedonian battalions and one battalion from fascist Italian occupied Kosovo. Regions controlled by the partisans now included Debarca, Mavrovo, and Rostuša, within Italy's occupied territory.\n\nImmediately after the establishment of the free territory in western Vardar Macedonia, the German command made an incursion into the areas held by the provisional authority. The problem for the Germans was the fact that the free territory was cutting off communications between Skopje and northeastern Greece. After assembling two divisions and artillery units, the Macedonian forces started operations to re-capture the territory. The struggle lasted more than two months, with the most important battles being at Buković, Debarca, Kicevo and Slivovo. The town of Kicevo was recaptured by the Germans in the beginning of November, but three days later it once again fell to Macedonian partisan hands, to be later re-captured for the second time by the German troops.\n\nThe High Command of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia together with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia decided to take evasive maneuvers in order to avoid total destruction of the Macedonian forces because of the overwhelming number of enemy troops engaged. Only few small units were left behind. After more than two months of constant battles, in December 1943 the Macedonian MNOV together with the CC of the CPM started a massive retreat through Prespa and after a 13-day march entered Greek Macedonia.\n\nBulgaria managed to save its entire 48,000-strong Jewish population during World War II from deportation to Nazi concentration camps, but under German pressure those Jews from their newly annexed territories without Bulgarian citizenship were deported, such as those from Vardar Macedonia and Western Thrace. The Bulgarian government was responsible for the roundup and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola.\n\nThe Bulgarian authorities created a special Gendarmerie force which received almost unlimited power to pursue the Communist partisans in the whole kingdom. The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their supporters. Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of Allied victories showing that the Axis might lose the war encouraged more Macedonians to support the Communist Partisan resistance movement of Josip Broz Tito.\n\nMany former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo's partisans. With the help of the Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian paramilitary detachments (Uhrana) were organized in occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia and charged with protecting the local population in the zones under German and Italian control. Around this time Ivan Mihailov of IMRO had plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under German control. He was a follower of the idea of a united Macedonian state with a dominant Bulgarian element. It was anticipated by the Germans that members of IMRO would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia led by Ivan Mihailov.\n\nAfter passing through the whole of western Greek Macedonia, the main forces of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia were stationed in the Almopia region in Greece close to the Yugoslav border. The Partisan detachments that were active in Gevgelia and Tikvesh also crossed the border into northern Greece and met with the main forces of the MNOV. Several meetings were held with members of ELAS and the Greek Communist Party. One of the decisions was the creation of wider partisan detachments composed of the ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. On 20 December 1943 in the village of Fustani in the Pella district of Greece, the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed out of the 3 battalions of the 3rd operative zone. The Bulgarian \"Hristo Botev\" partisan battalion of the MNOV was formed out of captured and escaped Bulgarian soldiers. It was under the command of the HQ of MNOV. The rest of the fighters that were not included in the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade and the Second Macedonian Assault Brigade (the \"Hristo Botev\" and \"Stiv Naumov\" battalion together with several smaller partisan detachments) were organized into the so-called \"Third Group of Battalions\". The provisional HQ of the reorganized MNOV was stationed in the village of Fustani in the Pella district. Because the massive concentration of MNOV troops in the Moglena district was jeopardizing the Axis communication to Thessaloniki, Bulgarian and German forces launched an incursion against the MNOV in Moglena and at Mount Kozuv. The fighting lasted from 26 December till 18 January. All Axis attacks were repelled, and Mount Kozuf remained a free territory held by the MNOV.\n\nAfter the fight for Mount Kozuf, the Headquarters of the MNOV decided to launch a three-phase offensive in central and eastern Vardar Macedonia against the fascist occupation forces – known as the \"February March\". In accordance with the February March plan, on 31 January 1944 the First Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade started marching towards the Veles and Porech regions, but immediately after crossing the border, the Brigade was attacked by two Bulgarian divisions. After constant fighting in cold weather, on 14 February the brigade returned to Greek Macedonia. Although it did not fulfill its mission because of the energetic counter-attacks of the Bulgarians, the First Brigade engaged two divisions of the Bulgarian 5th Army in that region. This opened a gap for the Third Group of Brigades together with CPM and the HQ of MNOV to pass through eastern Macedonia. The Second Macedonian Assault Brigade conducted incursions from 31 January till mid 1944 from Kozuf to Gevgelia and Demir Kapija regions, disrupting the Bulgarian authority in the villages and closing Bulgarian schools. On 31 January the Third Group of Brigades together with the HQ of the MNOV and the CC of the CPM started marching from the village of Zborsko to eastern Vardar Macedonia. 23 days later, after 400 km of travel through five mountain ranges in terrible weather and constant engagements with Bulgarian army units, the Third Group of Battalions was in partisan held territory near Kumanovo. There it made contacts with the forces in Pčinja District and the Bulgarian Resistance. The \"Hristo Botev\" battalion, which was until then under the command of the MNOV of Macedonia, was transferred to the Bulgarian resistance command.\n\nThe 3rd Battalion Group merged with the two existing Macedonian battalions in Kumanovo region and formed the famous Third Macedonian Assault Brigade in the Kumanovo village of Zegljane on 26 February 1944. After its formation, the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade became the biggest partisan formation in Macedonia and Southern Serbia.\n\nIn South Morava, Serbian Chetniks held the terrain, supported by the Germans. The Chetniks prevented the communists from organising in that area. After a meeting in Prohor Pčinjski monastery it was decided the command of the South Moravian and Kosovo partisan detachments would be given to the HQ of MNOV of Macedonia, as it was the most organized and most experienced. The first objective of the HQ of MNOV after the expansion of its command region was the destruction of the Chetnik movement in Macedonia and Pčinja District, starting with the Chetniks stationed in Vardar Macedonia.\n\nAs of 1941, attempts were made to create a Serbian loyalist movement in Vardar Macedonia. A few bands were formed in Veles, Prilep and Strumica, mainly by war veterans and by former Chetnik leaders. These groups were few in numbers, decentralized, and some were formed under their own initiative. By mid 1942 all of them were destroyed by units of the Bulgarian army. At the beginning of 1943, in order to organize a strong Chetnik force in Vardar Macedonia, and in order to destroy the group influenced by Kosta Pecanac, Draža Mihailović sent in Lieutenant Milivoje Trbić. He quickly organized local committees in Skopje, Veles, Kicevo and Gostivar and started recruiting volunteers among the Serbs of Macedonia. Soon the Vardar Chetnik Corps (VCC) was formed headed by Stojan Krstić (a native of Prilep), which had about 8,000 fighters in Vardar Macedonia.\n\nAfter the formation of the first battalions of the Macedonian National Liberation Army, the VCC directed all of its efforts to destroying the liberation movement of the Macedonian people. The Porech Chetnik Brigade terrorized the villages that supported the partisans and started conducting forced mobilization. This stimulated anger against the Chetniks and pushed more volunteers into the ranks of the partisan army. In December 1943 the High Command gave Hristijan Todorovski Karpoš the task of destroying the Chetniks in the Skopska Crna Gora region in Skopje and Kozjak in Kumanovo. With detachments from Kumanovo and Skopje, he attacked the Chetniks in three battles, the most important of which occurred near the village of Dragomance at the end of 1943. This battle brought to an end the Chetnik presence in the Kumanovo region. By end of January the Chetniks in Kicevo and Skopska Crna Gora were disarmed by the MNOV. The Porech Chetnik brigade also capitulated, and those fighters entered the ranks of the Porech partisan battalion. After being defeated in Dragomance and Porech, the remaining Chetniks from various scattered brigades merged and concentrated in the Kozjak area on the border with Serbia, where they managed to occupy all of the villages.\n\nThe Serbian Chetniks holding the mountain villages in Kozjak presented a real obstacle for the Partisans, depriving them of the strategic mountain areas in their struggle against the Bulgarian army. Also, the Vardar Chetnik Corps started a massive attack on the Partisans, which made the situation even worse.\n\nAt the end of January 1944, the High Command of the MNOV decided to launch an offensive, with the intention of destroying the VCC. On 29 February 1944 the partisans of the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked the Chetnik flanks from north, west and south, while the Hristo Botev detachment hit the Chetniks from the east. In the battle for the village of Sejac, the Vardar Chetnik Corps was totally destroyed, suffering 53 casualties (46 shot by partisans and 7 drowned in the river Pčinja while attempting to flee). 97 Chetniks, including 5 officers, were captured in the action. On 3 March 1944 in the village of Novo Selo, Partisan fighters destroyed the remaining force, capturing 30 Chetniks and more than 100 rifles and ammunition. The Serbian Chetniks suffered 12 dead, including Stojan Krstić, their commander. After these decisive battles Draža Mihailović's Chetnik organization ceased to exist as a powerful force in Macedonia. Various local Chetnik bands, decentralized and acting on their own accord, such as the Porech Chetniks, continued to operate in certain parts of Macedonia but they were generally scattered and disorganized.\n\nThe February March campaign of 1944 had a great political and moral impact. The whole Bulgarian 5th Army, all of the Bulgarian police, as well as the army regiments stationed in Kjustendil and Gorna Dzumaja were engaged in the battles. After the February March, the Bulgarian government was forced to change its strategy – organization of the fighting would no longer be the responsibility of the police but of the army, and all organizations would be obliged to help the army.\n\nAfter the operations which ended with the destruction of the Chetniks in Macedonia, the HQ of the MNOV, now acting as supreme commander of the partisan units in Vardar Macedonia, Kosovo and South Morava, decided to engage in three new attacks on the Bulgarian police and administration. On 26 April 1944 the Third Macedonian Assault Brigade together with the Kosovo detachment successfully attacked the city of Ristovac, where 130 Bulgarian soldiers were killed and 20 captured by the Macedonian partisans. On 3 April 1944 the 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked the mining town of Zletovo, where about 100 miners entered the ranks of the brigade.\n\nBecause of increased partisan activity, the main supply lines for the German Army group \"E\" stationed in Greece and Albania were constantly ambushed and jeopardized. In order to obtain control over the supply lines and the wider areas around them, the Bulgarian and German armies organized an offensive in Macedonia and south-east Serbia, as part of the Seventh Anti-Partisan Offensive, also known as the Raid on Drvar. In this offensive the occupation authorities mobilised the Bulgarian 5th Army, additional Bulgarian troops from Bulgaria, Chetnik forces from Vlasotince and Leskovac, Greek reactionary PAO units, Albanian Balli Kombëtar from western Macedonia and the whole German garrison from Kilkis, making a total of 60,000 military and administrative personnel in the area.\n\nAt the same time, the HQ of the MNOV was making plans to liberate western Macedonia and sent the 1st Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade there. Pushing towards Debarca, the 1st Macedonian-Kosovo Assault Brigade had clashes with the Bulgarians and Germans in Zavoj and Velmej. The Germans obtained reinforcements and on 8 May 1944 they counter-attacked. The fighting ended on 20 May 1944 with the Germans being pushed out of the region. After recapturing the Debarca area, more reinforcements became available, so the brigade was split in two brigades – the 1st Macedonian and 1st Kosovo Assault Brigades. Also, two smaller detachments were formed and charged with the objective of spreading the insurrection in Azot and Porech.\n\nIn order to prevent the Germans and Bulgarians from taking total control of the action, the MNOV decided to make surprise attacks on enemy positions and to try to exhaust the enemy any way they could. The 2nd Macedonian Assault Brigade was sent to conduct several actions in Povardarie (central Macedonia) and Pelagonia near Prilep and Bitola. From 25 April until 22 June 1944, the 2nd Macedonian Assault Brigade attacked enemy forces, positions and garrisons at Gradeshnica, Tikveš, Konopishte, Demir Kapija, Strmashevo, Kavadarci and Negotino.\n\nThe longest battles were conducted in eastern Macedonia and Pčinja District, where the main German supply lines (Vardar and Morava) and those of the Bulgarians (Skopje-Sofia) were jeopardized. The main forces of the occupying armies were concentrated in that area. This position not only controlled the main communication lines, but positioned them to attack the Macedonian, south Serbian, and Bulgarian resistance movements which were stationed in north-eastern Macedonia. In order to confuse the enemy, the MNOV ordered a surprise attack by the 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade on the city of Kratovo. After a half-day battle, Kratovo fell into the hands of the partisans. The attack and liberation of Kratovo had a great political and military impact in a time when the Germans and Bulgarians were starting a massive offensive, but it did not stop the Nazis. The 3rd Macedonian Assault Brigade was forced to leave Kratovo three days later, and was involved in many clashes with the Axis armies making while their way 10 km north of Kilkis in Greece. There they rested, reorganized, and started a counter-offensive against the Bulgarians and Germans, battling from Kilkis through eastern Macedonia, passing into Serbia all the way to Crna Trava, where together with the 6th South Moravian Brigade they engaged the enemy in the final battles of this offensive.\n\nIn the two months of fighting during the Spring Offensive the Axis forces suffered many casualties. In western Macedonia there were 672 killed and 76 captured Axis soldiers, in central Macedonia (Povardarie) there were 180 killed and 88 captured, in eastern Macedonia and south-eastern Serbia there were over 1,060 killed and 498 captured. A large amount of weapons and ammunition was seized. The newly conscripted men from the freed territories as well as the captured firearms were used to form new brigades and divisions. On 23 July 1944 in Plackovica, the 4th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed, and was sent to eastern Macedonia in order to make contact with the resistance movement in western Bulgaria.\n\nIn the beginning of August in Porech the 5th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed. One week after its formation it managed to destroy the remains of the Porech Chetniks. In western Macedonia the 6th Macedonian Assault Brigade was formed and was immediately given the assignment of clearing the armed forces of the Balli Kombëtar from western Macedonia. By the end of August four new brigades were formed out of newly recruited volunteers – the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Assault Brigades. In the village of Sheshkovo the 1st Macedonian Division was formed out of these new brigades.\n\nOn 2 August 1944, on the 41st anniversary of the Ilinden Uprising, the first session of the newly created Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM) was held at the St. Prohor Pčinjski monastery.\n\nIn spite of Tito's hopes to the contrary, the presiding committee of ASNOM was dominated by elements that were not known for their pro-Yugoslav sentiments. To the displeasure of those preferring joining the Yugoslav Socialist Federation, Metodija Andonov-Čento was elected president and Panko Brashnarov (former member of IMRO) vice-president. The assembly tried to secure as much independence as possible for Yugoslav Macedonia and gave priority to the unification of the three parts of Macedonia. Several sources state that Chento had made plans for creating an independent Macedonia which would be backed by the USA.\n\nА manifesto was written outlining the future plans of ASNOM for an independent Macedonian state and declaring the Macedonian language as the official language of Macedonia.\n\nASNOM was the governing body of Macedonia from its formation until the end of World War II.\n\nThe Manifesto of ASNOM eventually became a compromise between the \"maximalists\" and the \"minimalists\" – the unification of the Macedonian people was discussed and propagandized but the decision was ultimately reached that Vardar Macedonia would become a part of the new Communist Yugoslavia.\n\nThe proponents of the \"maximalist\" line were in favor of the creation of an independent United Macedonian state which would have ties with Yugoslavia, but not necessarily inclusion in a Yugoslav Federation. Proponents of this option included Metodija Andonov-Čento, as well as prominent figures of the former IMRO (United) such as Pavel Shatev, Panko Brashnarov, and others. They saw joining Yugoslavia as a form of Serbian dominance over Macedonia, and preferred membership in a Balkan Federation or else complete independence.\n\nProponents of the \"minimalist\" line were also for the creation of a Macedonian state, but within the Yugoslavian federation.\n\nThese differences were visible in the ASNOM discussions, but they especially came into the open after the final liberation of Macedonia. It must be added that both \"maximalist\" and \"minimalist\" lines within the National Liberation Movement in Vardar Macedonia supported the existence of a separate Macedonian identity and were in favor of the creation of a separate state in which the Macedonian people would have their homeland. The greatest difference between the two lines was whether Macedonia should join Yugoslavia, or exist as an independent country.\n\nBy August 1944, the Soviet Army was approaching the Balkans. In a last-minute attempt to create a buffer state against the incoming Red Army, on 29 August, the Germans attempted to establish an 'independent' Macedonian puppet state, led by Ivan Mihailov. Unlike the leftist resistance, the right wing followers of IMRO were pro-Bulgarian orientated, and did not support the existence of a future Yugoslavia. The Bulgarian interior minister was put in charge to contact Mihajlov, who at the time was an advisor to Croatia's Nazi leader Ante Pavelić. The state was to receive no military (troops or weapons) backing from Germany, because the Germans were running short on troops and weapons. Telegrams from the time indicate that an orderly Bulgarian-German troop withdrawal would precede the formation of such a puppet state. Bulgaria ordered its troops to withdraw from Macedonia on 2 September. In the evening on 3 September, Ivan Mihailov was flown in first from Zagreb to Sofia, to see what 'can be saved\". Two telegrams from 5 September at 1:7 and 6 September at 2:20 relay Hitler's reorder for the establishment of such a state. Mihajlov was transported from Sofia to Skopje in the evening of 5 September. Based on German telegrams from the time, Ivan Mihailov was offered the establishment of such a state, but by 18:00 (6 pm) on 6 September, he declined for inability to gather support. The failure led to ordering German withdrawal from Greece on 6 September and appointing Senior-Field-Commandant for Greece Heinz Scheeuerlen as the new Senior-Field-Commandant for Macedonia. Germany closed its Consulate in Skopje and evacuated its staff together with Ivan Mihailov and his wife out of Macedonia. However on 8 September, right-wing IMRO nationalists declared independence; however, the self-proclaimed state was left \"virtually defenseless\" following the withdrawal of German troops. The Germans did not support the proclaimed Macedonian state as their forces withdrew from the region. In the chaos, they tried only to use the new-formed \"Macedonian committees\" as local police stations. Their members were vormer activists of the IMRO, and the Bulgarian Action Committees.\n\nIn September 1944 the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria and occupied part of the country. A coup d'état on 9 September led to Bulgaria joining the Soviets. A day earlier Bulgaria had declared war to Nazi Germany. This turn of events put Bulgarian divisions stationed in Macedonia in a difficult situation. German troops had closed round them, while their command was being nonplused by the high treason of some staff officers, who had deserted to the German side. The withdrawing Bulgarian troops in Macedonia, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Josip Broz formed relations with the new pro-Communist authorities in Bulgaria. After the occupation of Bulgaria by the Soviet army negotiations between Tito and the Bulgarian Communist leaders were organized in September–October 1944, resulting in a military alliance between the Yugoslav forces and Bulgaria. That was followed by demobilization of the Macedonian recruits, who formed as much as 40% – 60% of the soldiers in some Bulgarian battalions. As a result, the \"Gotse Delchev\" brigade was set up and equipped in Sofia by the Bulgarian government providing the basis for the deployment of considerable Yugoslav troops in Vardar Macedonia.\n\nUnder the leadership of the new Bulgarian pro-Soviet government, four Bulgarian armies, 455,000 strong in total, were mobilized and reorganized. By the end of September, the Red Army 3rd Ukrainian Front troops were concentrated at the Bulgarian-Yugoslav border. In the early October 1944 three Bulgarian armies, consisting of around 340,000-man, together with the Red Army reentered occupied Yugoslavia and moved from Sofia to Niš, Skopje and Pristina to blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. In Macedonia the Bulgarians operated in conjunction with the fighters of the MNLA, but this cooperation did not proceed without difficulties. From 8 October to 19 November, the \"Stratsin-Kumanovo operation\" was held and Kratovo, Kriva Palanka, Kumanovo and Skopje were taken. At the same time the \"Bregalnitsa-Strumica operation\" was led, and the Wehrmacht was driven from the villages of Delchevo, Kočani, Stip, Strumica and Veles. In parallel, the \"Kosovo operation\" was also taking a place, aiming to expel the German forces from Kosovo. Southern and Eastern Serbia, Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia were liberated by the end of November. The 3rd Ukrainian Front in collaboration with the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia and Bulgarian People's Army carried out the Belgrade Offensive. The 130,000-strong Bulgarian First Army continued to Hungary, driving off the Germans, while the rest moved back to Bulgaria. On a series of maps from Army Group E, showing its withdrawal through Macedonia and Southern Serbia, as well as in the memoirs of its chief of staff, there is almost no indication of Yugoslav Partisan units, but only Bulgarian divisions. Despite these facts, the contribution of Bulgarian troops is still much debated in the Republic of Macedonia for political reasons.\n\nIn October 1944 more new brigades were formed: In Veles, Skopje and Kumanovo regions, the new 12th, 16th and 18th Assault Brigades were formed; in eastern Macedonia the 13th, 14th, 19th, 20th and 21st Assault Brigades; and in western Macedonia the 15th Macedonian Assault Brigade. By the end of October 1944 in Vardar Macedonia there were 21 Macedonian, one Kosovar, one Albanian, and the 1st Aegean Macedonian brigade (composed of 1500 armed former Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front (SNOF) members that crossed the border into Vardar Macedonia after ELAS ordered the dissolution of their unit). The 1st Macedonian Cavalry Brigade and the 1st Macedonian Automobile Brigade were formed using captured equipment, arms, vehicles, and horses. From August until the beginning of November three Engineering Brigades were formed which started repairing the roads. The new brigades were grouped in six new divisions, which made the total force of the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia three Corps composed of seven divisions, consisting of some 66,000 Macedonian Partisans. By mid-November 1944 the Germans were completely dislodged from Macedonia, and organs of \"People's Authority\" were established. The German Brigade \"Angermiler\" was positioned at the Kačanik Gorge. Skopje was defended by elements of the 22nd Infantry Division and parts of the 11th Luftwaffe Division (which was mainly involved in the fighting in eastern Macedonia), and units from other divisions. Skopje was liberated on 13 November by the 42nd and 50th Macedonian Divisions. After the liberation of Skopje, the HQ of the MNOV sent one artillery and 12 Assault Brigades to western Macedonia, where they enjoyed a decisive victory over the armed forces of the Balli Kombëtar. After fierce fighting, Kicevo was liberated on 16 November, Gostivar on 18 November and Tetovo on 19 November. During these the MNOV killed or captured 13,000 armed Balli Kombëtar troops (about 90% of their forces). On 19 November 1944, with the liberation of Tetovo and Gostivar, the Vardar region of Macedonia was completely liberated. Because of constant clashes with the MNOV the retreat of German Army Group E was blocked for 14 days, and during the final operations for the liberation of Macedonia the German troops had considerable loss of manpower and material: The 22nd Grenadier and 11th Luftwaffe Divisions suffered 10% casualties and a 15% loss of equipment.\n\nChronological composition by the number of the members of MNLA was as follows:\nThe total number of casualties in Macedonia from World War II was approximately 24,000, as follows: 7,000 Jews, 6,000 Serbians, 6,000 ethnic Macedonians, 4,000 Albanians and 1,000 Bulgarians. This includes around 3,000 \"collaborationists\", \"counter-revolutionaries\" and civilian victims, 7,000 Jews exterminated in concentration camps, and 14,000 resistance fighters and soldiers, of which 5,000 were Macedonians.\n\nDespite Bulgaria's significant involvement on the side of the Allies at the end of the war, the country was not cast as a co-fighting country at the Paris Peace Conference, 1946 and was ordered to pay Yugoslavia war reparations for the occupation of Macedonia and Southern Serbia, which Yugoslavia unilaterally abandoned in 1947.\n\nMacedonia gained the respect of its allies through its contribution to the victory over fascism. It gained recognition of the newly established Macedonian Republic by the Allies, even though within the framework of the Yugoslavian Federation. And through the National Liberation War of Macedonia, for the first time in modern history, the Macedonian people managed to obtain their statehood, nation and language. These events marked the defeat of the Bulgarian nationalism and the victory of the Macedonism in the area.\n\nAfter the liberation the Presidium of the Anti-Fascist Assembly for the People's Liberation of Macedonia (ASNOM), which was the governing body of Macedonia, made several statements and actions that were contradictory to the decisions of the Anti-Fascist Council of the People's Liberation of Yugoslavia (AVNOJ), the Yugoslav executive authority. Tito's General Headquarters sent orders asking the forces of the MNOV to participate in the fighting in the Syrmian Front for the final liberation of Yugoslavia. President Metodija Andonov-Čento and his associates debated whether to send the troops to Srem and help liberate Yugoslavia or to advance the troops under his command toward Greek Macedonia in order to \"unify the Macedonian people\" into one country. Officers loyal to Andonov-Čento mutinied in the garrison stationed in Skopje Fortress, but the mutiny was suppressed by armed intervention. A dozen officers were shot on the spot, with others sentenced to life imprisonment. Andonov-Čento and his close associates were trying to minimize the ties with Yugoslavia as far as possible and promoted the unification of the Macedonian people into one state, which was contrary to the decisions of AVNOJ. As result Andonov-Čento was replaced by Lazar Kolishevski, who started fully implementing the pro-Yugoslav line. \n\nThe new leadership of the People's Republic of Macedonia headed by Lazar Kolishevski confirmed the decisions of AVNOJ, and Macedonia joined Yugoslavia. Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia eventually all became part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia . The Macedonian national feelings were already ripe at that time as compared to 1941. Subsequently, to wipe out the remaining bulgarophile sentiments, the new Communist authorities persecuted the right-wing nationalists with the charges of \"great-Bulgarian chauvinism\". The next task was also to break up all the organisations that opposed the idea of Yugoslavia. So even older left-wing politicians, who were at some degree pro-Bulgarian oriented, were purged from their positions, then isolated, arrested and imprisoned on fabricated charges, as foreign agents, demanding greater independence, forming of conspirative political groups and the like. Besides, many people went throughout the labor camp of Goli Otok in the middle 1940s. The number of the victims is estimated to 50 000, including those killed, imprisoned, deported, sent to forced labor, tortured, etc.\n\nThe gloriﬁcation of the Yugoslav Partisan movement became one of the main components of the post-war Yugoslav political propaganda. Despite that, before the Summer of 1944, the Macedonian Partisans were not significant military force. Their activity did not differ from the typically Balkan “hajduk” traditions as ambushes and lack of military planning. They were ill-equipped and did not have good training. The Partisans received more weapons after the events of the September 9, 1944 when Bulgarian military equipment fell into their hands. On the other hand, it became clear in the autumn of 1944, that the Bulgarian army was the real force behind the driving the Germans out of eastern Serbia and Macedonia. However the ofﬁcial Yugoslav and later Macedonian historiography, has played down their role by political grounds. For example, according to Macedonian sources Bulgarians did even not participate in the operations for the capture of Skopje. Nevertheless Skopje was seized not without the decisive role of the Bulgarian troops.\n\n\n\n"}
