It was then confirmed by the AFF that starting with the 2018 edition, a new format would be applied. The nine highest ranked teams would automatically qualify with the 10th and 11th ranked teams playing in a two-legged qualifier. The 10 teams would be split in two groups of five and play a round robin system with each team playing two home and two away fixtures. A draw will be made to determine where the teams play while the format of the knockout round would remain unchanged.\n\nNine teams are automatically qualified in the AFF Championship final tournament. Based on the 2016 AFF Championship ranking, Brunei and Timor Leste played in a home and away play offs which was be conducted on 1 and 8 September 2018 with the latter securing qualification. Australia, a member since 2013, did not enter the tournament.\n\nThe draw for the tournament was held on 2 May 2018 at Hotel Mulia in Jakarta, Indonesia with the pot placements followed each teams progress in the previous two editions. At the time of the draw the identity of the national team that secured qualification was still to be determined (Timor-Leste).\n\nEach team were allowed a preliminary squad of 50 players. A final squad of 23 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) must be registered one day before the first match of the tournament.\n\nThe following referees were chosen for the competition.\nThere are one venue for each participating countries in the tournament with each countries get two group matches played in their home stadium. Before the tournament being held, both the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) and Myanmar Football Federation (MFF) have requesting AFF to allow their two home matches to be held in two different stadiums in different cities. The Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) also asked AFF to move their final group match against Cambodia to Hàng Đẫy Stadium as the match date is coincides with the opening ceremony of the Vietnam National Games that will be held in Mỹ Đình National Stadium by which the request was accepted through the AFF meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 13 September. East Timor will play their designated \"home\" match against Thailand at the Rajamangala Stadium in Bangkok, while their home tie against the Philippines will be played at the Kuala Lumpur Stadium in Malaysia due to the incomplete floodlighting of the Dili Municipal Stadium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the final tournament, a player was suspended for the subsequent match in the competition for either getting red card or accumulating two yellow cards in two different matches.\n\nNew tournament visuals, including a logo, for the AFF Championship was unveiled for the 2018 edition during the official draw held on 2 May 2018. The ASEAN Football Federation cooperated with Lagardère Sports for the tournament's branding. Five attributes were identified that are \"synonymous\" to the tournament. Elements combined to form the logo are a beating heart, a goalpost and raised hands by a fan that is meant to signify \"pride, loyalty, football, rivalry, and passion\".\n\nIn addition a colour scheme was developed for the branding. The colours devised are magenta (passion and energy), cyan (fresh beginning), green (vibrancy of a football pitch) and blue (topography of the region).\n\nThe official ball for AFF Suzuki Cup 2018 are the Primero Mundo X Star, which is sponsored by Grand Sport Group.\n\nAs there is no Vietnamese players participating in a press conference before the opening match against Laos on 8 November in Vientiane, the Vietnam Football Federation (VFF) has been fined VNĐ220 million (US$10,000) by the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) with a warning that the penalty will be heavier if their team continues to relapse as under AFF rules any head coach and a starting player from each team must show up at the pre-match press conference one day prior to the match. Another issues happened during the encounter between Myanmar and Vietnam in Group A in Yangon when the Vietnamese side dissatisfied over the controversial decision made by Qatari referee Khamis Al-Marri after their supposed two penalties are denied and another onside goal are being considered as offside by Thai linesman Phubes Lekpha despite video replay showed the Vietnamese player was indeed onside at the time. An argument then occurred between Burmese coach Antoine Hey and Vietnamese coach Park Hang-seo which resulting Park did not shook hands with Hey after the match. As a result, many questions on the availability and importance of video assistant referee (VAR) like in the recent 2018 FIFA World Cup have arises where many believed it should be already enforceable in any international football matches.\n\nIn another situation, 20 Myanmar fans including women who were waiting for bus in the city of Kuala Lumpur to return after the end of the last Group A match between Malaysia and Myanmar were attacked by around 30 unidentified assailants who then physically assaulted them while shouting vulgar words. Three of the Myanmar fans were injured and had been sent to hospital for treatment with the victims decided not to make a police report since there will be no effective actions been taken on such cases. Although no police report made by the victims, the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) taking the matter seriously with its Secretary Stuart Michael Ramalingam had made a visit to the victims representative to apologise, telling that they have ensured security measures being taken inside the stadium during the game but cannot prevent any untoward incident that happened outside the stadium thus urging every football supporters to control their behaviour with a sportsmanship spirit. Despite the apology, the Myanmar Football Federation (MFF) has sent a letter to the AFF for any action to be taken against the host country since it has been a repeat of similar fan violence in recent years, urging for a definite ending to such violence towards any visitor fans in any future matches hosted by Malaysia as well for a heavy penalty towards them if such problems keep recurring. As stated in their letter, the MFF wrote:\n\nFollowing the complaint, FAM were given two warning notices by the AFF with a possible fines of RM21,000 (US$5,000) with the latter warning are as a result of the behaviour of some Malaysian supporters throwing powerful firecracker into the stadium track after the end of group match against Myanmar. The Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) also been fined Rp116 million (US$8,000) by the AFF after one of their player were found out to be using a shirt with sponsor logo during their group match against Timor-Leste as under AFF Disciplinary Code 6.11 (Colour and Shirt Number), each team may not display the sponsor's logo either inside or outside the stadium during official training, games and at press conferences. Following their team poor performance and early elimination from Group B in the tournament group stage, PSSI chairman Edy Rahmayadi blamed Indonesian media and press as the main cause for the team failure. Coach Bima Sakti's accusation on the Philippine team using many \"naturalised players\" then angered many Filipino football supporters. Philippines midfielder Stephan Schröck, a Filipino-German, also expressed his anger thru social media saying “call us half-bloods all day, but once we’ve met, only half of you will be left”.\n\n"}

Devoted mainly to opera, it also includes concerts of orchestral, chamber, vocal and solo instrumental music.\n\nThe first festival took place in July 1948. It was founded by Countess Lily Pastré, who covered the entire costs in 1948. It was made up of three or four concerts in the cour de l'Archevêché, a concert in the Saint-Sauveur cathedral, and six further concerts and recitals in various locations throughout the town. An opera was added to these concerts, Mozart's \"Così fan tutte\", a work practically unknown by the French public at the time. However, it was not until 1949 that the festival became a success with its production of \"Don Giovanni\".\n\nFrom inception until 1974, the festival was directed by Gabriel Dussurget who devoted much attention to the artistic and detailed aspects of the productions, which in turn attracted much attention to the festival.\n\nIn 1970, Mstislav Rostropovich premiered Henri Dutilleux's Tout un monde lointain..., now considered as one of the most important additions to the cello repertoire of the 20th century, at the festival.\n\nUnder the direction of Bernard Lefort from 1974 to 1982, the Festival became devoted to bel canto opera and, in general, a celebration of the voice. Performances of 19th century operas by Verdi and Donizetti were given by the reigning stars of bel canto such as Montserrat Caballé, José Carreras, Marilyn Horne, and Katia Ricciarelli, and the Festival spread throughout the town.\n\nFrom 1982, a broadening of the repertoire to include baroque to modern operas (Britten and Prokofiev, in particular) characterized the era of director Louis Erlo, who gave preference to Mozart by staging new productions of his most famous works, but also the early operas written in the composer's youth.\n\nIn 1998 Stéphane Lissner took over the Festival, accomplishing a complete renovation of the Théâtre de l'Archevêché and thus making it the heart of the Festival. New operas were commissioned, most recently the 2005 production of \"Julie\" by the Belgian composer Philippe Boesmans, based on Strindberg's \"Miss Julie.\"\n\nIn 2006, it featured concerts and operas as well as master classes. These included Wagner's \"Das Rheingold\" conducted by Sir Simon Rattle with Sir Willard White as Wotan; Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\", conducted by Daniel Harding; Rossini's \"The Italian Girl in Algiers\"; the Berlin Philharmonic playing Mahler's 5th Symphony; and Pierre Boulez, conducting and on the piano and works by Henry Purcell.\n\nPerformances are given in a variety of locations, including:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "839581", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=839581", "title": "Charles Sweeney", "text": "Charles Sweeney\n\nCharles W. Sweeney (December 27, 1919 – July 16, 2004) was an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and the pilot who flew Bockscar carrying the Fat Man atomic bomb to the Japanese city of Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. Separating from active duty at the end of World War II, he later became an officer in the Massachusetts Air National Guard as the Army Air Forces transitioned to an independent U.S. Air Force, eventually rising to the rank of major general.\n\nSweeney became an instructor in the atomic missions training project, Project Alberta, at Wendover Army Airfield, Utah. Selected to be part of the 509th Composite Group commanded by Col. Paul Tibbets, he was named commander of the 320th Troop Carrier Squadron on 6 January 1945. Initially his squadron used C-47 Skytrain and C-46 Commando transports on hand to conduct the top secret operations to supply the 509th, but in April 1945 it acquired five C-54 Skymasters, which had the range to deliver personnel and materiel to the western Pacific area.\n\nOn May 4, 1945, Sweeney became commander of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy, the combat element of the 509th, in charge of 15 Silverplate B-29s and their flight and ground crews, 535 men in all. In June and July Sweeney moved his unit to North Field on the island of Tinian in the Marianas.\n\nIn addition to supervising the intensive training of his flight crews during July 1945, Sweeney was slated to command the second atomic bomb mission. He trained with the crew of Captain (Charles D.) Don Albury aboard their B-29 \"The Great Artiste\", and was aircraft commander on the training mission of July 11. He and the crew flew five of the nine rehearsal test drops of inert Little Boy and Fat Man bomb assemblies in preparation for the missions.\n\nOn 6 August 1945, Sweeney and Albury piloted \"The Great Artiste\" as the instrumentation and observation support aircraft for the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima.\n\nOn 9 August 1945, Major Sweeney commanded \"Bockscar\", which carried the atomic bomb \"Fat Man\" from the island of Tinian to Nagasaki. In addition to \"Bockscar\", the mission included two observation and instrumentation support B-29s, \"The Great Artiste\" and \"The Big Stink\", who would rendezvous with \"Bockscar\" over Yakushima Island. At the mission pre-briefing, the three planes were ordered to make their rendezvous over Yakushima at 30,000 feet due to weather conditions over Iwo Jima (the Hiroshima mission rendezvous). That same morning, on the day of the mission, the ground crew notified Sweeney that a faulty fuel transfer pump made it impossible to utilize some 625 gallons of fuel in the tail, but Sweeney, as aircraft commander, elected to proceed with the mission.\n\nBefore takeoff, Col. Tibbets warned Sweeney that he had lost at least 45 minutes of flying time because of the fuel pump problem, and to take no more than fifteen minutes at the rendezvous before proceeding directly to the primary target.\n\nAfter takeoff from Tinian, \"Bockscar\" reached its rendezvous point and after circling for an extended period, found \"The Great Artiste\", but not \"The Big Stink\". Climbing to 30,000 feet, the assigned rendezvous altitude, both aircraft slowly circled Yakushima Island. Though Sweeney had been ordered not to wait at the rendezvous for the other aircraft longer than fifteen minutes before proceeding to the primary target, Sweeney continued to wait for \"The Big Stink\", perhaps at the urging of Commander Frederick Ashworth, the plane's weaponeer. After exceeding the original rendezvous time limit by a half-hour, \"Bockscar\", accompanied by \"The Great Artiste\", proceeded to the primary target, Kokura. No fewer than three bomb runs were made, but the delay at the rendezvous had resulted in 7/10ths cloud cover over the primary target, and the bombardier was unable to drop. By the time of the third bomb run, Japanese antiaircraft fire was getting close, and Japanese fighter planes could be seen climbing to intercept \"Bockscar\".\n\nPoor bombing visibility and an increasingly critical fuel shortage eventually forced \"Bockscar\" to divert from Kokura and attack the secondary target, Nagasaki. As they approached Nagasaki, the heart of the city's downtown was covered by dense cloud, and Sweeney and the plane's weaponeer, Commander Ashworth, initially decided to bomb Nagasaki using radar. However, a small opening in the clouds allowed \"Bockscar's\" bombardier to verify the target as Nagasaki. As the crew had been ordered to drop the bomb visually if possible, Sweeney decided to proceed with a visual bomb run. \"Bockscar\" then dropped \"Fat Man\", with a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT. It exploded 43 seconds later at above the ground, at least northwest of the planned aim point. The failure to drop \"Fat Man\" at the precise bomb aim point caused the atomic blast to be confined to the Urakami Valley. As a consequence, a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, and only 60% of Nagasaki was destroyed. The bombing also severed the Mitsubishi arms production extensively and killed an estimated 35,000-40,000 people outright, including 23,200-28,200 Japanese industrial workers, 2,000 Korean slave laborers, and 150 Japanese soldiers.\n\nLow on fuel, \"Bockscar\" barely made it to the runway on Okinawa. With only enough fuel for one landing attempt, Sweeney brought \"Bockscar\" in fast and hard, ordering every available distress flare on board to be fired as he did so. The number two engine died from fuel starvation as \"Bockscar\" began its final approach. Touching the runway hard, the heavy B-29 slewed left and towards a row of parked B-24 bombers before the pilots managed to regain control. With both pilots standing on the brakes, Sweeney made a swerving 90-degree turn at the end of the runway to avoid going over the cliff into the ocean. 2nd Lt. Jacob Beser recalled that at this point, two engines had died from fuel exhaustion, while \"the centrifugal force resulting from the turn was almost enough to put us through the side of the airplane.\"\n\nAfter \"Bockscar\" returned to Tinian, Col. Tibbets recorded that he was faced with the dilemma of considering “if any action should be taken against the airplane commander, Charles Sweeney, for failure to command.” After meeting on Guam with Col. Tibbets and Major Sweeney, General Curtis LeMay, chief of staff for the Strategic Air Forces, confronted Sweeney, stating \"You fucked up, didn't you, Chuck?\", to which Sweeney made no reply. LeMay then turned to Tibbets and told him that an investigation into Sweeney's conduct of the mission would serve no useful purpose.\n\nIn November 1945, Sweeney returned with the 509th Composite Group to Roswell Army Air Base in New Mexico to train aircrews for the atomic testing mission, Operation Crossroads.\n\nSweeney left active duty with the rank of lieutenant colonel on June 28, 1946, but remained active with the Massachusetts Air National Guard. Later promoted to full colonel, on February 21, 1956, Sweeney was named commander of its 102nd Air Defense Wing and shortly after, on April 6, was promoted to Brigadier General. During this time, he was activated with the 102nd and served in Europe during the Berlin Crisis from October 1961 to August 1962. Sweeney was made Chief of Staff in October 1967.\n\nHe retired in 1976 as a major general in the Air National Guard. He also appeared in the 1970s television series \"The World at War\" and was seen explaining the USAAF buildup to the mission raids.\n\nThroughout his life Sweeney remained convinced of the appropriateness and necessity of the bombing. \"I saw these beautiful young men who were being slaughtered by an evil, evil military force,\" he said in 1995. \"There's no question in my mind that President Truman made the right decision.\" At the same time, he said, \"As the man who commanded the last atomic mission, I pray that I retain that singular distinction.\"\n\nNear the end of his life, Sweeney wrote a controversial and factually disputed memoir of the atomic bombing and the 509th Composite Group, \"War's End: An Eyewitness Account of America's Last Atomic Mission\". In \"War's End\", Sweeney defended the decision to drop the atomic bomb in light of subsequent historical questioning. However, it was Sweeney's other assertions regarding the Nagasaki atomic mission, along with various anecdotes regarding the 509th and its crews that drew the most criticism. General Paul Tibbets, Major \"Dutch\" Van Kirk, Colonel Thomas Ferebee and others vigorously disputed Sweeney's account of events. Partly in response to \"War's End\", General Tibbets issued a revised version of his own autobiography in 1998, adding a new section on the Nagasaki attack in which he harshly criticized Sweeney’s actions during the mission.\n\nIn his later years Charles Sweeney performed in various air shows doing many maneuvers to awe crowds. Sweeney died at age 84 on July 16, 2004 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\nA short documentary featuring an audio recording of Sweeney describing the Nagasaki mission preparation and execution called \"Nagasaki: The Commander's Voice\" was made in 2005. The 2002 audio recording was the last one made before his death.\n\n  Armed Forces Reserve Medal with gold hourglass device\n\n  Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon\n\n  Massachusetts Air National Guard Service Medal\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "982004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=982004", "title": "Coextinction", "text": "Coextinction\n\nCoextinction and cothreatened refer to the phenomena of the loss or decline of a host species resulting in the loss or endangerment of other species that depends on it, potentially leading to cascading effects across trophic levels. The term originated by the authors Stork and Lyal (1993) and was originally used to explain the extinction of parasitic insects following the loss of their specific hosts. The term is now used to describe the loss of any interacting species, including competition with their counterpart, and specialist herbivores with their food source. Coextinction is especially common when a keystone species goes extinct.\n\nThe most frequently cited example is that of the extinct passenger pigeon and its parasitic bird lice \"Columbicola extinctus\" and \"Campanulotes defectus\". Recently, \"C. extinctus\" was rediscovered on the band-tailed pigeon, and \"C. defectus\" was found to be a likely case of misidentification of the existing \"Campanulotes flavus\". However, even though the passenger pigeon louse was rediscovered, coextinctions of other parasites, even on the passenger pigeon, may have occurred. Several louse species—such as \"Rallicola extinctus\", a huia parasite—probably became extinct together with their hosts.\n\nRecent studies have suggested that up to 50% of species may go extinct in the next 50 years. This is in part due to coextinction; for example the loss of tropical butterfly species from Singapore is attributed to the loss of their specific larval host plants. To see how possible future cases of coextinction would play out, researchers have made models to show probabilistic relationships between affiliate and host extinctions across co-evolved inter-specific systems. The subjects are pollinating Ficus Wasps and Ficus, primate parasites, (Pneumocystis Fungi, Nematode, and Lice) and their hosts, parasitic mites and lice and their avian hosts, butterflies and their larval host plants, and ant butterflies and their host ants. For all but the most host-specific affiliate groups (e.g., primate Pneumocystis fungi and primates), affiliate extinction levels may be modest at low levels of host extinction but can be expected to rise quickly as host extinctions increase to levels predicted in the near future. This curvilinear relationship between host and affiliate extinction levels may also explain, in part, why so few coextinction events have been documented to date.\n\nInvestigations have been carried out into coextinction risk among the rich Psyllid fauna Hemiptera – Psylloidea inhabiting acacias (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae: Acacia) in central eastern New South Wales, Australia. The results, suggest that \"A. ausfeldii\" hosts one specialist psyllid species, Acizzia, and that \"A. gordonii\" hosts one specialist psyllid, Acizzia. Both psyllid species may be threatened at the same level of their host species with coextinction.\n\nInteraction patterns can be used to anticipate the consequences of phylogenetic effects. By using a system of methodical observations, scientists can use the phylogenetic relationships of species to predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. Consequentially, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree.\n\nIn a 2004 paper in \"Science\", ecologist Lian Pin Koh and colleagues discuss coextinction, stating\n\n\"Species coextinction is a manifestation of the interconnectedness of organisms in complex ecosystems. The loss of species through coextinction represents the loss of irreplaceable evolutionary and coevolutionary history. In view of the global extinction crisis, it is imperative that coextinction be the focus of future research to understand the intricate processes of species extinctions. While coextinction may not be the most important cause of species extinctions, it is certainly an insidious one.\" (Koh \"et al.\" 2004)\n\nKoh \"et al.\" also define coendangered as taxa \"likely to go extinct if their currently endangered hosts [...] become extinct.\"\n\nOne example is the near extinction of the genus \"Hibiscadelphus\" as a consequence of the disappearance of several of the Hawaiian honeycreepers, its pollinators. There are several instances of predators and scavengers dying out following the disappearance of species which represented their source of food: for example, the coextinction of the Haast's eagle with the moa.\n\nCoextinction may also occur on a local level: for example, the decline in the red ant \"Myrmica sabuleti\" in southern England, caused by habitat loss, resulted in the local extinction of the large blue butterfly, which is dependent on the ant as a host for the larvae. In this case the ant avoided local extinction, and the butterfly has been reintroduced.\n\nAnother example of species going through coextinction is the rhinoceros stomach bot fly (\"Gyrostigma rhinocerontis\") and its host species the endangered black rhinoceros and white rhinoceros (\"Diceros bicornis\" and \"Ceratotherium simum\"). The fly's larvae mature in a rhinoceros's stomach lining, having entered the body via the digestive tract, and so are dependent on rhinoceros species to reproduce.\n\nCoextinction can mean loss of biodiversity and diversification. Coextinctions can influence not only parasite and mutualist diversification but also their hosts. Arguably, parasites facilitate host diversification through sexual selection. That loss of parasites can reduce host diversification rates. Coextinction can also result in loss of evolutionary history. The extinction of related hosts can lead to the extinction of related parasites. The loss of history is likely to be greater than the loss expected, were species to go extinct at random. Furthermore, if coextinctions are clustered, it is more likely that coextinction can produce non-random trait loss. Species that are at risk of coextinction are expected to be larger because rare hosts tend to be larger and larger hosts have larger parasites. They can also be expected to have lengthy generation times or higher tropic positions. Coextinction can extend beyond biodiversity and has direct and indirect consequences from the communities of lost species. One main consequence of coextinction that goes beyond biodiversity is mutualism, by loss of food production with a decline in threatened pollinators. Losses of parasites can have negative impacts on humans or the species. In rare hosts, losses of specialist parasites can predispose hosts to infection by emergent parasites. Furthermore, relating to the consequences of removing specialist parasites from rare hosts, is the problem of where the parasites will go once their host is extinct. If the parasites are dependent on only those species than there are parasite species that are at risk of extinction through co-endangerment. On the other hand, if they are able to find and switch onto alternative hosts, those hosts can turn out to be humans. Either way, the loss of parasites by co extinction or the acquiring of new parasites by alternative hosts, proves to be a major issue. Coextinction can go beyond the decreased biodiversity, it can range into various biomes and link various ecosystems.\n\nA study conducted in New Caledonia has shown that extinction of a coral reef-associated fish species of average size would eventually result in the co-extinction of at least ten species of parasites.\n\nThe host Specificity and Life Cycle is a major factor in the risk of coextinction. Species of mutalists, parasites, and many free-living insects that have staged life cycles are more likely to be a victim of coextinction. This is due to the fact that these organisms may depend on multiple hosts throughout their lives in comparison to simple life cycled organisms. Also, if organisms are evolutionary flexible, then these organisms may escape extinction.\n\nThe area with that has the greatest affect of coextinction is the tropics. There is a continued disappearance in the habitat, human intervention, and a great loss in vital ecosystem services. This is threatening because the tropics contain 2/3 of the all known species but they aren't in a situation where they can be fully taken care of. Along with forest loss other risk factors include: coastal development, overexploitation of wildlife, and habitat conversion, that also affect human well-being.\n\nIn an effort to find a stop to coextinction, researchers have found that the first step would be to conserve the host species in which other species are dependent on.

{"id": "3070865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3070865", "title": "Conquest of Mecca", "text": "Conquest of Mecca\n\nThe conquest of Mecca ( \"\") refers to the event when Mecca was conquered by Muslims led by Muhammad in December 629 or January 630 AD, (Julian), 10-20 Ramadan, 8 AH.\n\nAncient sources vary as to the dates of these events.\nThe conversion of these dates to the Julian calendar depends on what assumptions are made about the calendar in use in Mecca at the time. For example, 18 Ramadan 8 AH may be converted to 11 December 629 AD, 10 or 11 January 630, or 6 June 630 AD.\n\nIn 628 the Meccan tribe of Quraysh and the Muslim community in Medina signed a 10 year truce called the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. \n\nIn 630, this truce was broken when the Banu Bakr, allies of the Quraysh, attacked the Banu Khuza'a, who had recently become allies of the Muslims.\n\nAccording to the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, the Arab tribes were given the option of joining either of the sides, the Muslims or Quraysh. Should any of these tribes face aggression, the party to which it was allied would have the right to retaliate. As a consequence, Banu Bakr joined Quraysh, and Khuza'ah joined the Muslims. They thus lived in peace for some time; but ulterior motives stretching back to the pre-Islamic period, ignited by unabated fire of revenge, triggered fresh hostilities. Banu Bakr, without concern for the provisions of the treaty, attacked Banu Khuza'a in a place called Al-Wateer in Sha'ban, in 8 AH. Quraysh helped Banu Bakr with men and arms, taking advantage of the dark night. Pressed by their enemies, the tribesmen of Khuza'ah sought the Holy Sanctuary, but here too, their lives were not spared, and, contrary to all accepted traditions, Nawfal, the chief of Banu Bakr, chased them in the sanctified area — where no blood should be shed — and massacred his adversaries. Khuza'ah at once sent a delegation to Medina to inform Muhammad, of this breach of truce and to seek help from Muslims of Medina being their allies.\n\nAfter the incident, Quraysh sent a delegation to Muhammad, petitioning to maintain the treaty with the Muslims and offering material compensation. The Muslim forces had gathered in strength to settle account with Quraysh and for the final attack and the opening of Mecca. \n\nAfter Abu Sufyan ibn Harb's departure, Muhammad immediately assembled a large army. The objective of the operation was kept secret and even Muhammad's close friends and commanders did not know his plans. Muhammad intended to assemble and attack the Quraysh using the element of surprise. For further secrecy, Muhammad sent Abu Qatadah towards \"Batan Izm\" to give the impression that he wanted to go there.\n\nThe Muslim army set out for Mecca on Wednesday, 29 November 629 (6 Ramadan, 8 AH). Volunteers and contingents from allied tribes joined the Muslim army on the way swelling its size to about 10,000 strong. This was the largest Muslim force ever assembled as of that time. The army stayed at Marr-uz-Zahran, located ten miles northwest of Mecca. Muhammad ordered every man to light a fire so as to make the Meccans overestimate the size of the army.\n\nMeanwhile, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb travelled back and forth between Muhammad and Mecca, still trying to reach a settlement in order to avoid conquest. According to the sources, he found assistance in Muhammad's uncle Al-Abbas, though some scholars consider that historians writing under the rule of Abbas' descendants, the Abbasid Dynasty, had exaggerated Abbas' role and downplayed the role of Abu Sufyan, who was the ancestor of the Abbaside's enemies.\n\nMecca lies in the Valley of Ibrahim, surrounded by black rugged hills reaching heights of at some places. There were four entry routes through passes in the hills. These were from the north-west, the south-west, the south, and the north-east. Muhammad divided the Muslim army into four columns: one to advance through each pass. The main column in which Muhammad was present was commanded by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah. It was tasked to enter Mecca through the main Madina route, from the north-west near Azakhir. Muhammad's cousin Az Zubayr commanded the second column and it would enter Mecca from the south-west, through a pass west of Kuda hill. The column entering from the south through Kudai was under the leadership of Muhammad's cousin Ali. The last column under Khalid ibn al-Walid was tasked to enter from the north-east, through Khandama and Lait.\n\nTheir tactic was to advance simultaneously from all sides targeting a single central objective. This would lead to the dispersion of enemy forces and prevent their concentration on any one front. Another important reason for this tactic was that even if one or two of the attacking columns faced stiff resistance and became unable to break through, then the attack could continue from other flanks. This would also prevent any of the Quresh from escaping.\n\nMuhammad emphasized on refraining from fighting unless Quresh attacked. The Muslim army entered Mecca on Monday, 11 December 629 (18 Ramadan 8 hijrah). The entry was peaceful and bloodless entry on three sectors except for that of Khalid's column. The hardened anti-Muslims like Ikrimah and Sufwan gathered a band of Quresh fighters and faced Khalid's column. The Quresh attacked the Muslims with swords and bows, and the Muslims charged the Quresh's positions. After a short skirmish the Quresh gave ground after losing twelve men. Muslim losses were two warriors.\n\nOn the eve of the opening, Abu Sufyan adopted Islam. When asked by Muhammad, he conceded that the Meccan gods had proved powerless and that there was indeed \"no god but Allah\", the first part of the Islamic confession of faith. In turn, Muhammad declared Abu Sufyan's house a sanctuary because he was the present chief, and that all the others were gathered over his territory, therefore:\n\nHe also declared:\n\nThen, along with his companions Muhammad visited the Kaaba. The idols were broken and their gods were destroyed. Thereupon Muhammad recited the following verse from the Quran:\"Say, the Truth has come and falsehood gone. Verily falsehood is bound to vanish.\"()\n\nThe people assembled at the Kaaba, and Muhammad delivered the following address:\n\nThen Muhammad turning to the people said:\n\n\"O Quraysh, what do you think of the treatment that I should accord you?\"\n\nAnd they said, \"Mercy, O Prophet of Allah. We expect nothing but good from you.\"\n\nThereupon Muhammad declared:\n\n\"I speak to you in the same words as Yūsuf spoke to his brothers. This day there is no reproof against you; Go your way, for you are free.\"\nMuhammad's prestige grew after the surrender of the Meccans. Emissaries from all over Arabia came to Medina to accept him.\n\nTen people were ordered to be killed: Ikrimah ibn Abi-Jahl, Abdullah ibn Saad ibn Abi Sarh, Habbar bin Aswad, Miqyas Subabah Laythi, Huwairath bin Nuqayd, Abdullah Hilal and four women who had been guilty of murder or other offences or had sparked off the war and disrupted the peace.\n\nHowever, they were not all killed; Ikrimah lived to adopt Islam and fight in future battles among Muslim ranks.\nOf the two singing girls who were outlawed by Mohammad, one was slain but the other spared because she converted to Islam. Ibn Abi Sarh had been granted protection under Uthman ibn Affan and when he initially refused to take the mandatory oath of allegiance to Muhammad, the bystanders still did not kill him, due to misunderstanding the edict of Mohammad.\n\nThe opening of Mecca was followed by the Battle of Hunayn.\n\n"}

The shows are difficult to verify and may be urban legends, but anecdotal accounts are frequent. Author Jim Dawson writes: \"No doubt there are clandestine clubs that have put these sordid floorshows on display, but if every man who claims he actually saw one is telling the truth, there must be a lot of bowlegged women hobbling around Tijuana.\" Gustavo Arellano, in his ¡Ask a Mexican! column, argues that donkey shows are not real.\n\nThe \"donkey show\" in Tijuana myth is deeply embedded in American film, including \"Losin' It\" (1983), \"Bachelor Party\" (1984), \"The 40-Year Old Virgin\" (2005), \"Clerks II\" (2006), \"The Heartbreak Kid\" (2007), and \"Cake\" (2014).\n\nIn the 2005 book \"The Godfather Returns\" written by Mark Winegardner, Fredo Corleone's wife Deanna Dunn insists on attending one: \"on a whim, they'd headed to Mexico.

From time to time one may come across naive tourists going up and down \"La Coahuila\" street, unsuccessfully trying to find the show.\n\nMore recently the term has been used to describe a situation that has become a \"complete mess\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4363391", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4363391", "title": "Environmental crime", "text": "Environmental crime\n\nEnvironmental crime is an illegal act which directly harms the environment. International bodies such as the G8, Interpol, European Union, United Nations Environment Programme and the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute have recognised the following environmental crimes:\nThese crimes are liable for prosecution. Interpol facilitates international police cooperation and assists its member countries in the effective enforcement of national and international environmental laws and treaties. Interpol began fighting environmental crime in 1992.\n\nInternational criminal gangs and militant groups profit from the plunder of natural resources and these illegal profits are soaring. Terrorism and even civil wars are consequences of environmental crime. According to UNEP and Interpol, in June 2016 the value of environmental crime is 26 per cent larger than previous estimates, at US$91–258 billion, compared to US$70–213 billion in 2014, outstripping illegal trade in small arms. More than half of this amount can be attributed to illegal logging and deforestation.\n\nOn September 2016 it was announced that the International Criminal Court located in The Hague will prosecute government and individuals for environmental crimes. According to the Case Selection Criteria announced in Policy Paper on Case Selection and Prioritisation by ICC on 15 September 2016, the Office will give particular consideration to prosecuting Rome Statute crimes that are committed by means of, or that result in, \"inter alia, the destruction of the environment, the illegal exploitation of natural resources or the illegal dispossession of land\".\n\nAbandoned or little used areas are common dumping places in America -especially railroads. Over $10 million a year are used to remove illegal dumping from polluting towns and the environment. A small organization, CSXT Police Environment Crimes Unit, has been started to stop railroad dumping specifically. \n\nEver since the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Criminal Enforcement was founded in 1982, there has been a steady increase in prosecuted environmental crimes. This includes the prosecution of companies that have illegally dumped or caused oil spills. On a federal level, while the EPA oversees the investigations, the prosecutions are typically brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, through its Environmental Crimes Section, and/or through one of the 94 U.S. Attorney's Office across the country.\n\nThe effective enforcement of environmental laws is vital to any protection regimes that are designed to protect the environment. In the early days of environmental legislation, violations carried largely insignificant civil fines and penalties. Initial environmental laws and regulations had little or no deterrent effect on corporations, individuals, or governments to comply with environmental laws. Indeed, a major source of failure of US environmental protection legislation was the civil character of federal enforcement actions. Their chief sanction was fines, which many corporations took in stride as a cost of doing business. Environmental criminal law covers narrower ground. Its core consists of the criminal provisions of eight federal statutes passed mainly in the 1970s and amended in the last two decades.\n\nIn many cases, particularly corporations found it more cost-effective to continue to pollute more than the law allowed and simply pay any associate fines if indeed the corporation was actually found and convicted of violating environmental laws or regulations. Perversely, corporations actually had a disincentive to comply with environmental laws or regulations as compliance generally raised their operational costs which meant that many corporations obeying the environmental laws, whether out of a sense of legal duty or public obligation, were disadvantaged and lost a competitive edge and consequently suffered in the marketplace to competitors who disregarded environmental laws and regulations. As a result of weak environmental legislation and continued adverse public opinion regarding the management of the environment, many governments established various environmental enforcement regimes that dramatically increased the legal powers of environmental investigators. The inclusion of criminal sanctions, significant increases in fines coupled with possible imprisonment of corporate officers changed the face of environmental law enforcement. For example, between 1983 and 1990 the US Department of Justice secured $57,358,404.00 in criminal penalties and obtained sentences of imprisonment for 55% of defendants charged with environmental offences.\n\nEnforcing environmental laws and regulations is an important ingredient in protecting the environment and reducing environmental harm. This is generally achieved by various environmental law enforcement agencies operating at an International, Regional, National, State and Local level. For instance, to some extent environmental law enforcement agencies operate only at an international level whereas others only operate at the local level. Furthermore, environmental law enforcement agencies utilise various enforcement methods to ensure compliance to environmental legislation. In some cases enforcement agencies rely on coercive powers to demand compliance to environmental laws, generally labelled “command and control” strategies, while others rely on conciliatory and educational strategies to persuade individuals, organisations and governments to comply with environmental laws and regulations. Moreover, it has increased the need for cooperation between different policing institutions.\nEnvironmental law enforcement agencies and police services do not operate in a vacuum; the legislative instruments that political systems implement govern their activities and responsibilities within society. However, ostensibly it is the legislative instruments implemented by governments that determine many of the strategies utilised by police services in protecting the environment. Generally these International, Regional, National and State legislative instruments are designed to ensure industries, individuals, and governments comply with the various environmental obligations embedded in national statutes and laws. There are also international legal instruments and treaties that also affect the way that sovereign states deal with environmental issues .\n\nEnvironmental criminology examines the notions of crimes, offences and injurious behaviours against the environment and starts to examine the role that societies including corporations, governments and communities play in generating environmental harms. Criminology is now starting to recognise the impact of humans on the environment and how law enforcement agencies and the judiciary measure harm to the environment and attribute sanctions to the offenders.\n\n\n"}

In 1931 the rules were re-written to allow for what might be termed amateur pilots to compete and those same rules still apply today. The King’s Cup was the first and only air race to receive royal patronage.\n\nWhilst this was a British phenomenon, the handicapping concept has been used to stage races worldwide.

The festival was the only genre based festival in the United States, featuring stages that focus specifically on hip-hop / electronica, indie rock, punk / metal, and comedy.\n\nStarted in 2006, the festival focuses on a combination of discovering emerging talent, putting together either rarely seen or anticipated reunion performances. Being based in Austin (The Live Music Capital of the World), FFF has the unique ability to work with new musicians that have yet to experience the national stage. The festival has a history of unearthing new artists that eventually end up in the mainstream music and festival markets. The festival's name itself was a nod to the historical independent music scene in Austin, specifically Big Boys, an early and highly influential hardcore punk group who released their EP \"Fun Fun Fun\" through the Austin-based underground label Moment Productions in 1982.. After the final Fun Fun Fun Fest, some of the organizers would go on to produce Sound on Sound Fest, \"Sound on Sound\" also being the title of a Big Boys song.\n\nFun Fun Fun Fest was known for its dedication to the unique Austin culture, featuring street food from some of Austin's favorite eateries, an annual American Poster Institute poster show featuring work from artists all over the U.S., along with pop up vintage fashion shops, hair salons, and record stores.

The Empire of Trebizond was founded on the Black Sea coast as a result of this expedition.\n\nQueen Tamar's attitude towards the emperors of Byzantine, ruled by Angelos, were somehow hostile; closely related to the Komnenoi, she could not forget that last Komnenos emperor of Byzantine Andronikos I Komnenos was dethroned and killed by the Angelos in 1185, while his son Manuel was blinded and may have died from this mutilation. however, his two infant grandsons, Alexios and David, sons of the Manuel and a Georgian princess, were saved through Georgian intervention and taken to Tbilisi, where they were raised at the court of their aunt and queen of Georgia,Tamar. In Georgia they had received their education, Vasiliev even speculates that \"Georgian became their native tongue\" and that they \"were thoroughly Georgian in language and education as well as in political ideals\".\n\nIn 1203, Tamar donated large sums of money to the Georgian monasteries in Antioch and Mount Athos. However, Emperor Alexios III Angelos confiscated Tamar’s donation.

After the negotiations led by the president had failed on 15 May, a temporary caretaker cabinet under Council of State president Panagiotis Pikrammenos was appointed on 16 May, and a new election was set for 17 June.\n\nArticle 37 of the Greek constitution stipulates the procedure for attempts to form governments after a national legislative election. As the 2012 Greek legislative election resulted in no single party with a majority of parliament seats, the Greek constitution stipulates that the largest party in relative terms of the voting result, shall be given a chance to negotiate the formation of a government within three days. Failing that, the second largest party will get a chance within the next three days and if this attempt also fails the third biggest party will get a further three days to try and form a government. If neither of the three largest parties can succeed in forming a government, the baton will be handed over to the president for a last neutral attempt to form a government, where he will meet with all party leaders. If this attempt fails as well, a temporary caretaker government will be formed with the purpose of setting up a date for a new legislative election.\n\nIf this attempt fails, then, according to article 37 paragraph 3 in the constitution of Greece, the president will try to form a temporary caretaker government with all parties for the purpose of preparing for an election. If this fails yet again the President of the Supreme Administrative Court, the President of the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court or the President of the Court of Audit, will be called to form a temporary caretaker government with the widest available support in order to prepare for a new election.\n\nThe day after the election, president Karolos Papoulias met with the leader of the largest party—New Democracy's (ND) leader Antonis Samaras—to task him with the first attempt to form a government. The Democratic Left (DIMAR) declared that the party would not join a pro-bailout New Democracy-PASOK grand coalition government. Democratic Left leader Fotis Kouvelis said that his party would only \"participate in a coalition government with other progressive forces,\" such as the other leftist anti-bailout parties SYRIZA and Communist Party of Greece (KKE). SYRIZA's Alexis Tsipras refused to join in a coalition with ND saying that: \"The campaign positions of Mr Samaras are at the opposite end of the alternative proposals of a left-wing government. There can be no government of national salvation, as Samaras has named it, because his signatures and commitments to the loan agreement do not constitute salvation but a tragedy for the people and the country.\" Independent Greeks (ANEL) also refused to discuss joining a coalition with ND. For its part, ND said that it would be open to talks with any party except Golden Dawn (XA), with Samaras saying he would likely end his efforts the following day, ahead of the deadline. KKE also refused to discuss the possibility of a government with ND. PASOK also said that it would consider joining a grand coalition only if other left-wing parties were in the government. At the end of the first day itself, ND's Samaras announced that he had failed in trying to form a \"national salvation\" government: \"I did whatever I could to secure a result but it was impossible. I informed Papoulias and returned the mandate.\"\n\nOn 8 May, Tsipras was tasked by Papoulias to attempt forming a government within the stipulated three days. Tsipras stated that \"we will exhaust all possibilities to reach an understanding, primarily with the forces of the left\" and that the election result was a \"message of overthrow against the barbaric measures put forth by the EU-IMF loan agreement.\" Tsipras said he wanted ND and PASOK to tell the EU in writing that they would not adhere to their pledge to maintain the austerity measures demanded before meeting them on 9 May saying that \"the bailout parties no longer have a majority in parliament to vote for measures that plunder the country.\" ND's Antonis Samaras refused to do so and said that he would support a minority government if need be. He also said Tsipras' demands could \"lead to immediate internal collapse and international bankruptcy, with the inevitable exit from Europe.\"\n\nThe Independent Greeks' Panos Kammenos had also criticised Tsipras already one week ahead of the election day, saying that \"there is not a sufficient majority to form an anti-memorandum front.\" As he had calculated that SYRIZA’s 52 MPs, Independent Greeks’ 33 and Democratic Left's 19 did not add up to the minority of 120 seats needed, in view of the Communist Party’s refusal. He also said that the discussion of \"issues of national importance, including the Macedonia naming issue and illegal immigration, led to differences of opinion.\" Tsipras then later said his attempts had failed and told his parliamentary group that \"we cannot make true our dream of a left-wing government. Tomorrow, I shall hand back the mandate given to me by the president of the republic and we shall continue to take part in the constitutional processes.\" He had previously said the election \"has clearly nullified the loan agreement and [pledges] sent to Europe and the IMF\" (International Monetary Fund).\n\nAt the same time the EU decided to continue with Greece's disbursements which mean sending US$5.4 billion on 10 May, but an additional US$1.29 billion was held back. As a result of the political imbroglio both PASOK and ND suggested the EU and IMF agreement could have to be re-evaluated. In response, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said that \"we have to say to the Greek people right now that the situation is serious, that no European Union country will be able to release even a portion of the 130 billion euros for the Greeks, if there is no functioning government that respects the rules and manages the disbursed money.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel added that \"everyone must stick to the things we have agreed. Twenty-five countries have already...signed the fiscal pact,\" targeting Greece and France, who also had election at the same time. Germany's finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also said that \"if Greece wants to remain in the eurozone, there is no better solution than the path it has already taken. You can't have one [bailout funds from EU and IMF] without the other [austerity measures to limit the budget deficits].\" While Germany's foreign minister Guido Westerwelle finally added that \"Germany would like to keep Greece in the eurozone, but whether Greece remains in the eurozone or not lies in its own hands.\"\n\nThe Greek newspaper Proto Thema claimed by the dawn of 9 May, that according to an anonymous source, PASOK leader Venizelos had decided he would not even accept the mandate to form a government, but instead straight away ask Papoulias to call a meeting of party leaders. Later the same day, however, after Tsipras announced that he had failed to form a government, Venizelos stated that during the course of the day new unexplored opportunities had emerged, and thus he would now try to form a national unity government within the stipulated three-day period, comprising either: PASOK, New Democracy, SYRIZA and Democratic Left (DIMAR), or in the alternative: PASOK, SYRIZA, DIMAR and Independent Greeks (ANEL) if all parties in that formation agreed to pledge a guarantee on Greece’s future course in the euro.\n\nAfter the first day with Venizelos negotiations, the meeting with DIMAR's Fotis Kouvelis was said to have though of forming a unity government with the purpose of keeping Greece within the European Union and eurozone, while respecting the outcome of the election in regards of also working for the gradual disengagement from the EU-IMF memorandum. According to Kouvelis, such a government should work out its mandate in the time frame until the European elections of 2014. Venizelos stated that: \"The discussion we had with Mr Kouvelis was very substantive. Mr Kouvelis set out a specific and responsible proposal. We are very close, it is virtually in line with our suggestion for the creation of a national unity government that seeks to move beyond the memorandum within three years.\"\n\nA meeting with New Democracy's Antonis Samaras and SYRIZA's Alexis Tsipras was scheduled for 11 May, in order to reveal if the new proposal of a \"unity government\" could reach a majority support. Before the meetings, DIMAR clarified their support for a \"unity government\" was conditional, that SYRIZA would also accept to join such a government. The first meeting with New Democracy was constructive, as they unconditionally were willing to participate in the proposed \"unity government\" with the overall aim \"to keep Greece within the European Union and the euro, and to renegotiate the implementation terms of the outlined EU-IMF austerity program\". Later the same day, Venizelos met with SYRIZA to learn whether they were ready to join the proposed \"unity government\" as the fourth party. As SYRIZA opted to turn down the propasal, Venizelos declared late on 11 May that all attempts to form a new government had been exhausted without any result, and that he would now meet with President Karolos Papoulias on 12 May to return his mandate. Venizelos stated that he hoped for all party leaders to act in a more mature and responsible way, when the president invited them for a last meeting and final attempt to form a unity government.\n\nPresident Karolos Papoulias called all party leaders to a meeting on 13 May in a final attempt to form a national unity government.\nAfter he had met with all represented parties over the course of the day, he decided to call for a second meeting the next day with the PASOK, ND and DIMAR. Due to SYRIZA's refusal to participate in the government, DIMAR again stated a government without SYRIZA would not have the necessary popular support. DIMAR leader Kouvelis also said that SYRIZA was inclined to want a new election due its expected improved performance; he added that Greece should also \"disengage\" from the terms of the EU-IMF deal. Ethnos echoed the words saying that \"Syriza has opened the way to new elections and this time it will be a sort of referendum [on the bailout].\"\n\nOn 13 May, Papoulias claimed to have a letter from incumbent interim Prime Minister Lucas Papademos which asserts that the Ministry of Finance would only afford to pay salaries and pensions until the end of June and that Papademos had warned of the urgent need for Greek to recapitalise their liquid assets following large losses in a bond exchange programme that decreased almost a third of the Greek debt of 350 billion euros. Though talks were scheduled to be held on 15 May, DIMAR executive board member Dimitris Hadzisokratis said that it would not join a government that is unrepresentative of \"the majority of Greek society. The last thing Greece needs is another round of elections but that is what is going to happen. We have decided that we cannot participate in a government that does not reflect the majority will of Greek society. I say this with a heavy heart. We would have preferred otherwise.\"\n\nThe talks failed on 15 May, with an early election expected in June. A caretaker cabinet under Council of State president Panagiotis Pikrammenos was appointed on 16 May, and the election date set for 17 June.\n\nAt the same time, Papoulias was told by the head of the Bank of Greece George Provopoulos that local financial institutions were concerned about a bank run with the increased rate of withdrawal of euros, which were up to 700 million.\n"}

Since then it has been held every year.\n\nThe Sangeet Sammelan which has grown from strength to strength in the last 131 years has been attracting audiences and artists from all across the country and abroad. This festival was declared as one of the National Festivals by the Department of Tourism, Govt. of India. All prominent artists of Hindustani Classical Music from India and Pakistan have come and performed at the Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan at one time or the other during the last 130 years. Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi accompanied by Vishnu Digambar Paluskar visited Baba Harballabh Sangeet Sammelan in the year 1919. Union Ministers, Governors, State Chief Ministers, State Ministers and other VIPs have been visiting to pay their reverence at this festival of music. The festival attracts thousands of music lovers from all over the India and abroad every year. This number is increasing year after year.\n\nIn 1956 a Sangeet Academy was constructed under the banner of Swami Hariballabh. While we hear Swami Hariballabh it seems clear that “The key to the mystery of a great artist is that for reasons unknown, he will give away his energies and his life just to make sure that one note follows another... and leaves us with the feeling that something is right in the world.” \n\nThe main aim of the festival was to attract and encourage more and more people for the development of classical Music. There is also a proper syllabus for the pursuers of Music and there is a shrine at the banks of the river with the name Devi Talab. There is a Shiva lingam in the temple nearby and one adores the exquisite phallic image of Lord Shiva. On the day of the fair there is also free lodging and accommodation.\n\nIt is held near the Samadhi of Saint Harballabh, from the 27th to 30 December. During this time reputed musicians from all over India gather in Jalandhar to celebrate Indian Classical Music.\n\n"}

Ways to reduce the appearance of hickeys include icing recent hickeys to reduce swelling, rubbing them with a chilled spoon to remove the bruise, and applying a warm compress to older hickeys to dilate vessels and promote blood flow. They can be covered with a concealer or powder corresponding to the sufferer's skin tone, or a fake tan. Alternatively, articles of clothing such as scarves, snoods, turtle necks, or sleeves may be used to conceal hickeys.\n"}

The overarching intent of a hot prowl burglary can be theft, robbery, sexual assault, murder, or another crime.\n\nHot prowl burglaries are considered especially dangerous by law enforcement because of the potential for a violent altercation to erupt between the occupant and the offender. \n\nThe Lindbergh Kidnapping - In 1932, one-year-old Charles Augustus Lindbergh, Jr. was kidnapped from his family's home in East Amwell, New Jersey and later murdered. The offender perpetrated the crime by using a ladder to enter a second floor bedroom of the Lindbergh residence while the family was asleep. Bruno Hauptmann, a German immigrant, was convicted of kidnapping and murdering the infant. He was executed by electrocution in 1936. The case received international attention and was considered \"the crime of the century\" because the victim's father was famed aviator Charles Lindbergh.\n\nThe BTK Killer - Between 1974 and 1991, a series of sexual assaults and murders was carried out in the Wichita, Kansas area. In most of the attacks, the offender broke into or forced his way into a residence, then killed one or more people. Dennis Rader, a compliance officer for the city of Park City, Kansas, was arrested for the BTK murders in 2005. Rader pleaded guilty to the crimes and is serving a life sentence.\n\nThe Original Night Stalker - Also known by the monikers \"East Area Rapist,\" the \"Diamond Knot Killer,\" and more recently the \"Golden State Killer,\" is a serial killer and rapist who was active in California in the 1970s and 1980s. The Original Night Stalker is known to have murdered ten people in Orange, Santa Barbara, and Ventura counties between 1979 and 1986. In 2001, a criminalist with the Orange County Sheriff's Department linked the Original Night Stalker to over fifty rapes which were committed in northern California between 1976 and 1979. The Original Night Stalker's modus operandi was to break into the homes of his victims in the middle of the night, then attack them as they slept. On April 25, 2018, Sacramento Police announced the arrest of a suspect in the case; 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo was arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder.\n\nThe Night Stalker - A series of murders, rapes, and robberies plagued the Los Angeles, California area in the mid-1980s. In all, twelve murders were committed in southern California as part of this series. Ultimately, the Los Angeles-area crimes were connected to two murders in San Francisco, California. In 1989, a Texas-born drug addict and convicted car thief named Richard Ramirez was convicted of the Night Stalker crimes. Ramirez died of complications secondary to B-cell lymphoma at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, California, on June 7, 2013, after 23 years of incarceration at San Quentin State Prison.\n\nThe Clutter Family Murders - In 1959, a quadruple murder rocked the small town of Holcomb, Kansas. The victims were a rancher named Herb Clutter and his wife Bonnie, as well as their two children Nancy and Kenyon. The offenders, who were later identified as Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, broke into the rural Clutter home with the intent of robbing the owner. After taking a small sum of money and a few of the Clutters' belongings, Hickock and Smith tied up the family in various parts of the house.\n\nEventually, Smith slashed Herb Clutter's throat and shot Kenyon with a shotgun. There is some question as to whether Hickock or Smith murdered Bonnie and Nancy Clutter, but nevertheless, both females were killed by shotgun blasts. Both Hickock and Smith were executed by hanging on April 14, 1965. The story of the Clutter Family Murders was immortalized by Truman Capote in the classic true crime book \"In Cold Blood.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27006825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27006825", "title": "International child abduction", "text": "International child abduction\n\nThe term international child abduction is generally synonymous with international \"parental kidnapping,\" \"child snatching\", and \"child stealing.\" However, the more precise legal usage of \"international child abduction\" originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, \"illegal\" is normally taken to mean \"in breach of custodial rights\" and \"home\" is defined as the child's habitual residence. As implied by the \"breach of custodial rights,\" the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.\n\nThere is a common misconception that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger. The harmful consequences for children and families have been shown in several studies and child abduction has been characterized as a form of parental alienation and child abuse. Adding international dimensions to the detrimental effects of child abduction significantly increases the detrimental effects on children and families. The modern day ease of international travel and corollary increase in international marriages is leading to a rapid rise in the number of international child abductions.\n\nInternational child abduction occurs when one parent unlawfully takes (or retains) a minor child in a country other than the one the child has his/her habitual residence. If that country is a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (applicable to children under 16), then the child will usually be returned to the country of origin. \n\nWhat is today called \"parental kidnapping,\" \"international child abduction,\", \"parental child abduction\" and \"parental child trafficking\" has existed as long as different legal jurisdictions and international borders have—though often under different names. None of these names achieved the modern day broad acceptance of terms like international child abduction. Lacking a common set of terminology or specifically designed laws to address the, at the time, poorly defined problem, researchers on the history of cross-border child abduction must search for terms like \"custodial interference,\" \"contempt of child custody orders,\" \"legal kidnapping\" or, in cases where children were viewed more as property than as individual subjects of rights, name variations on theft, child-maintenance debt and smuggling, among others.\n\nLawmakers struggled to typify and discuss international child abduction and discussions at the Hague Conference on Private International Law noted that, what some were referring to with variations on \"legal kidnapping,\" was an oxymoron since that which is legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term \"international child abduction.\" The terms first prominent use was in the title of the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms \"wrongful removal\" or \"wrongful retention\" which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system. The use of the term is now widespread in international law.\n\nIn all family law disputes a determination must be made as to which legal systems and laws should be applied to the dispute. This question becomes much more complicated when aspects, or parties, of the case occur in, or hail from, multiple legal jurisdictions.\n\nToday's international family law norms were heavily influenced by the concepts of domicile and nationality. In Europe these ideas were refined during the nineteenth century by Italian politician, Pasquale Mancini, who believed matters of personal status were to be governed by the nationality of the person. During the same period in the US and Latin America the prevailing principle was that jurisdiction over personal matters was determined by domicile which, in the Americas, was acquired immediately upon moving to a foreign jurisdiction even if neither citizenship nor nationality were acquired.\n\nStarting in the late eighteenth century until the early 1920s a number of efforts were made to develop a series of international treaties governing international conflicts of law in Europe. Treaties that favored nationality as the determining jurisdictional factor either never got of the ground, were not widely signed or had substantial practical problems with countries renouncing them after signing. At the same time the inter-American system in Latin America produced the Bustamante Code of 1928 and the Montevideo Conventions of 1939 and 1940. Of particular note in these later Conventions was the introduction of a definition of \"domicile\" that started with a reference to the \"habitual residence\" for civil status. Lessons learned in prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties culminated in a number of successful treaties in the mid-1900s, such as the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors, the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance drafted under the auspices of the United Nations, and the Hague Convention of 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors (\"1961 Convention.\") \n\nThe 1961 Convention brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of \"nationality\" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of \"habitual residence.\" It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the Boll case, in which Sweden claimed its public administrative law was exempt from the 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the \"interests of the child\" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion.\n\nIn actual cases of international child abduction, this lack of a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the \"habitual residence\" concept of the Convention in a manner that allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire \"habitual residence.\" This allowed judicial forum shopping and created perverse incentives for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.\n\nIn the 1970s, dissatisfaction with these results led to efforts to create conventions on the foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments to make it harder for courts to favor a parent solely because that parent is a national suing in his or her home state. Canada also proposed that the Hague Conference work on a Convention to address what it termed \"legal kidnapping.\" The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law – \"international child abduction.\" Although the problem of international child abduction was well understood, finding a way to address the problem in practice was exceedingly difficult, but the Swiss proposal had a solution that was elegant in its simplicity. Why not simply restore the \"status quo ante\"?\n\nIn 1980 the Hague Conference drafted a convention to address the problem of international child abduction: the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction – commonly referred to as the Abduction Convention. The Swiss idea of restoring the \"status quo ante\" after a \"wrongful removal\" or \"wrongful retention\" became a mainstay of the Abduction Convention. Under the convention, an application could be made for the return of a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained so long as the applicant possessed rights of custody, and provided that those rights were being \"actually exercised\" at the time of the abduction. The concept of \"actually exercised\" in reference to custodial rights itself was an innovation in terminology. Having met these requirements a child was to be returned \"forthwith\" except in exceptional circumstances.\n\nInspired by the Hague Evidence Convention and the Hague Service Convention's of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention required the establishment of a single Central Authority in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign central authorities. Furthermore, each central authority was required to take \"any and all actions\" to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other central authorities to do the same. All of these new obligations emphasized the need for international cooperation amongst state parties in achieving the objectives of the convention.\n\nEstablished in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of the Child reflected the growing international consensus that children be viewed as a subject of rights and not merely as an object of rights or of protective action. The UNCRC roused an unprecedented response with 187 countries ratifying it within seven years forming an essential backdrop in international children's law. Article 11 of the Convention explicitly requires State Parties to combat the illicit transfer and retention of children and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements that do so, Article 35 stipulates that \"States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form.\"\n\nThe 1996 Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures is the third of the modern Hague Conventions on international family law, following in the footsteps of the Abduction Convention and the Adoption Convention. It is much broader in scope than the first two conventions and covers a wide range of civil measures related to the protection of children including: orders concerning parental responsibility and contact, public measures of protection or care, matters of legal representation and the protection of children's property.\n\nThe Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.\n\nAlthough initially slow to gain support and plagued with political problems, the number of states acceding to it has begun to grow.\n\nAs the result of the harmful effects on children, parental kidnapping has been characterized as a form of child abuse and an extreme form of parental alienation. Abducted children suffer emotionally and sometimes physically at the hands of their abducting parents. Many are told the other parent is dead or has abandoned them. Uprooted from their entire life, home, family and friends, abducted children are often even given new names by their abductors and instructed to hide their real names or where they used to live. Generally the abductor avoids mentioning the victim parent and waits for time to erase difficult questions, such as \"When can we see mom/dad again?\". These children become hostages. It is beyond their comprehension that a parent who truly cares and loves them cannot discover their whereabouts. Childhood cannot be recaptured. Abductions rob a child of their sense of history, intimacy, values and morals, self-awareness, opportunity of knowing one's beginnings and the love and contact of extended family—a loss virtually no child possesses the ability to protect themselves against.\n\nHuntington (1982) lists some of the deleterious effects of abduction on child victims:\n\n1. Depression;\n2. Loss of community;\n3. Loss of stability, security, and trust;\n4. Excessive fearfulness, even of ordinary occurrences;\n5. Loneliness;\n6. Anger;\n7. Helplessness;\n8. Disruption in identity formation; and\n9. Fear of abandonment.\n\nMany of these effects can be subsumed by the problems relevant to reactive attachment disorder, stress, fear of abandonment, learned helplessness, and guilt.\n\nThe extended support systems of abducting and victim parents can also become part of the dispute. Believing primarily one side of the abduction story, family, friends, and professionals in each parents individual country may lose their objectivity. As a result, protective concerns expressed by the abandoned parent may be viewed as undue criticism, interference, and histrionics preventing the victim parent from effectively relieving the trauma imposed on their innocent child by the abduction.\n\nMediation is a process during which abductors and the left behind family, assisted by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.\n\nMediation can be helpful in international child abduction cases. In the context of mediation families can deal with the question of return and also find solutions to other issues relating to their children.\n\nInternational law has generally recognized that there may be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the 1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the 1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents. This foreshadowed the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the Hague Abduction Convention where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.\n\nThe principal purpose of the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child to his or her \"habitual residence.\" In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, \"the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a \"grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\"\" It is important to note that the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her \"habitual residence,\" unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her \"habitual residence\".\n\nIn the primary source of interpretation for the Convention, the Explanatory Report, Professor E. Perez-Vera noted the following:\n\n\"it would seem necessary to underline the fact that the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration.\"\n\nIn spite of the spirit and intent of the Convention as conveyed by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors as a vehicle to litigate the child's best interests or custody. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships. These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The \"best interests\" of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.\n\nAt the time the Hague Abduction Convention was drafted domestic violence was never explicitly considered as an affirmative defense for child abduction, although it may be brought as a defense under Article 13, if \"there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.\" Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, joint custody laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.\n\nLaunched in 1998 as a joint venture of the International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children (ICMEC) and the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Global Missing Children’s Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share best practices, and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.

Jazz Bilzen was the first festival on the continent where jazz and pop music were brought together. For this reason, Jazz Bilzen is sometimes called the \"mother of all European festivals\". \n\nLike the National Jazz and Blues Festival in the United Kingdom, and the Jazz Festival International in Comblain-la-Tour, which were paradigms, Bilzen started out solely as a jazz festival. Pretty soon however blues, skiffle, beat, folk and soul, in the end even punk, reggae and new wave, came to be incorporated as well.

{"id": "14034683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14034683", "title": "Occupation of the Rhineland", "text": "Occupation of the Rhineland\n\nThe Occupation of the Rhineland from 1 December 1918 until 30 June 1930 was a consequence of the collapse of the Imperial German Army in 1918. Despite Germany proving victorious on the eastern front following the Russian Revolution, the military high command had failed to prevent the continuing erosion of morale, both domestically and in the army. Despite transferring veteran troops from the eastern front to fight on the western front, the spring offensive was a failure and following the outbreak of the German Revolution the Germany's provisional government was obliged to agree to the terms of the 1918 armistice. This included accepting that the troops of the victorious powers occupied the left bank of the Rhine and four right bank \"bridgeheads\" with 30 kilometers radius around Cologne, Koblenz, Mainz and radius around Kehl. Furthermore, the left bank of the Rhine and a wide strip east of the Rhine was declared a demilitarized zone. The Treaty of Versailles repeated these provisions, but limited the presence of the foreign troops to fifteen years until 1934. The purpose of the occupation was on the one hand to give France security against a renewed German attack, and on the other to serve as a guarantee for reparations obligations. After this was apparently achieved with the Young Plan, the occupation of the Rhineland was prematurely ended on 30 June 1930. The administration of occupied Rhineland was under the jurisdiction of the Inter-Allied Rhineland High Commission with its seat at the Upper Presidium of the Rhine Province in Koblenz.\n\n\nThis consisted of 20,000 soldiers (five divisions) with its headquarters at Aachen, and with its troops stationed in Krefeld. They were commanded by Armand Huyghé.\n\nThe British Army entered German territory on 3 December 1918. The British Army of the Rhine was established as the occupying force in March 1919. Based at Cologne, they published \"The Cologne Post\".\n\nThe French Eighth and Tenth armies originally constituted the French forces involved in the occupation. The Eighth Army was commanded by General Augustin Gérard and occupied the Palatinate. The Tenth Army was commanded by General Charles Mangin and was responsible for the rest of the French zone from its headquarters in Mainz. \n\nOn 21 October 1919, they were combined to form the French Army of the Rhine.\n\nIn 1919 France stationed between 25,000 and 40,000 French colonial soldiers in the Rhineland. Some German women married African soldiers from the occupying forces, while others had children by them out of wedlock (hence the disparaging label \"Rhineland Bastards\") and were considered by right-wing Germans to constitute a public disgrace. General Henry Tureman Allen reported to the US Secretary of State that from the start of the occupation until June 1920 there were 66 cases of formal accusations against colored colonial troops, out of which there were 28 convictions, and admits there were many more unreported cases. Despite these occasional cases, \"the wholesale atrocities by French negro Colonial troops alleged in the German press, such as the alleged abductions, followed by rape, mutilation, murder and concealment of the bodies of the victims are false and intended as political propaganda\".\n\nFrench occupation of Frankfurt occurred from 6 April to 17 May 1920. On the second day nine civilians were shot by Moroccan troops in an incident outside the Hauptwache. This incident was used to launch a racist campaign against the French use of colonial troops, linking the incident with allegations of wide spread assaults by Black soldiers in the French occupation army on local women including accusations of systemic rape and other atrocities targeting the German civilian population and attributed mainly to Senegalese Tirailleurs. The events resulted in a widespread campaign by the German right-wing press, which dubbed them as \"The Black Shame\" (\"Die schwarze Schande\" or \"Die schwarze Schmach\") and depicted them as a form of French humiliation of the German nation.\nIn 1923, in response to German failure to pay reparations under the Treaty of Versailles, France and Belgium occupied the industrial Ruhr area of Germany, most of which lies across the river on the east bank of the Rhine, until 1925. Many Germans were killed during civil disobedience protests. e.g. against dismissal of German officials.\n\nThe United States originally provided around 240,000 men in nine veteran divisions, nearly a third of the total occupying force. General John J. Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force (A. E. F.) on the Western Front, established Third Army for the purpose, under the command of Major General Joseph T. Dickman. Third Army was assigned to occupy the northern sector of the Coblenz bridgehead. By July 1919, Third Army was disbanded, having been reduced to about 8,400 men, and was renamed American Forces in Germany (AF in G). AF in G withdrew on 24 January 1923, vacating Ehrenbreitstein, which was promptly occupied by the French.\nThe Siamese Expeditionary Forces also participated in the occupation until 1919 with their troops being stationed in Neustadt an der Weinstraße, located in the French area.\n\n\n\n"}

It is held on the Saturday nearest the United Nations' International Day of Peace, which takes place each year on Sept. 21. In 2015, Playing for Change Day was celebrated on September 19. The sixth-annual Playing for Change Day was on September 24, 2016.\n\nIn 2013, the Foundation introduced the Stand by Me Scholarship program, allowing people to sponsor a child to learn music for an entire year. Scholarships are need-based and are given to children who could not participate otherwise. Donors can either make a one-time gift to fund a student, or set up monthly contributions.\n"}
{"id": "5599953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5599953", "title": "Possession of stolen goods", "text": "Possession of stolen goods\n\nPossession of stolen goods is a crime in which an individual has bought, been given, or acquired stolen goods.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if an individual has accepted possession of goods or property and knew they were stolen, then the individual is typically charged with a misdemeanor or felony, depending on the value of the stolen goods. If the individual did not know the goods were stolen, then the goods are returned to the owner and the individual is not prosecuted. However, there are often exceptions, due to the difficulty of proving or disproving an individual's knowledge that the goods were stolen.\n\nThe Criminal Code specifies three offences:\n\nThe basic definition for the possession offence (which is almost identical in wording for the trafficking offences) is as follows:\n\nWhere the value of the property is greater than $5,000, the maximum punishment on indictment is 10 years for possession only, and 14 years if related to trafficking. Otherwise, the maximum on indictment is two years and five years respectively, or alternatively punishment by summary conviction. (ss 355 and 355.5)\n\nHandling stolen goods is the name of a statutory offence in England and Wales and Northern Ireland. It takes place after a theft or other dishonest acquisition is completed and may be committed by a fence or other person who helps the thief to realise the value of the stolen goods. It replaces the offence of receiving stolen goods under section 33 of the Larceny Act 1916.\n\nThis offence is created by section 22(1) of the Theft Act 1968 which provides:\nStolen goods: This term means property stolen anywhere, as long as the theft amounted to an offence where committed. It includes any proceeds of that property, including money for which it has been sold, and anything bought with those proceeds. However, property which has been returned to the original owner, or otherwise lawful custody, is no longer regarded as stolen, by section 24(3). This may create difficulties, as in Haughton v. Smith. It is not necessary that the property be \"stolen\" in a limited sense; section 24(4) of the Act specifically extends the scope to property obtained by fraud or blackmail. However, it is also implicit in the definition of offences such as burglary or robbery that handling may apply to the proceeds of these offences.\n\nDealing: The offence of handling is drafted widely enough to criminalise any dishonest dealing with property which has been come by dishonestly; for example, the original thief may also be convicted of a subsequent handling if he later arranges its sale. A codification of the methods of dealing has been suggested as\nThis makes the actus reus of handling very wide; for example, in R v Kanwar, a man had brought stolen goods into the marital home, and his wife, the defendant, had lied to the police; it was held that this constituted \"assisting in the retention\" of those goods.\n\nKnowledge or belief: The accused's knowledge or belief as to the nature of the goods is crucial, but has been a constant source of interpretive problems. Either may be based on what the thief says or some other positive information, but belief is less than knowledge and more than mere suspicion. In R v Hall [1985] 81 Cr App R 260, it was held that, per Boreham, J.,\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the concept of recklessness or wilful blindness to the circumstances; either will be treated as a belief that the goods are stolen. Thus, \"suspicion\" will be converted into belief when the facts are so obvious that belief may safely be imputed. So if the defendant bought goods in a pub or a dark alley for a fraction of their true value and it is clear that identification marks or serial numbers have been erased, any denial of belief by the defendant would not be credible.\n\nDishonestly: The \"mens rea\" of the offence is the same as for theft (see \"R v Ghosh\" 75 Cr App R 154.).\n\nThere was at one time an issue of impossibility in that the defendant may be dishonest and intend to handle goods (which he believes to be stolen) but which are not in fact stolen. The House of Lords ruled in Haughton v. Smith (1973) that where goods previously stolen have been reduced into lawful possession, not only can they not be handled, but there can be no attempt to handle them. Since then, section 1 of the Criminal Attempts Act 1981 confirms that such a defendant can be convicted.\n\nLaundering is now an offence under ss.327/9 and 340(3)(b) Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and the distinction with handling depends on whether the defendant's intention was to launder the proceeds of crime or merely to assist a thief. Laundering covers large amounts of money in a series of transactions over time when the defendant knows or suspects that the assets which he has concealed, acquired, used, possessed, or in respect of which he has entered into an arrangement which he knows or suspects facilitates the acquisition, retention, use or control of criminal property by or on behalf of another person, are the proceeds of criminal conduct (compare money laundering).\n\nSection 23 of the 1968 Act creates an offence of \"advertising rewards for the return of stolen goods\". This prohibits public advertising for the return of such goods stating that \"no questions will be asked\", or offering immunity from prosecution to the returner, or stating that any monies paid for the goods will be reimbursed. This is a summary offence but is rarely prosecuted.\n\nHandling stolen goods is triable either way. A person guilty of handling stolen goods is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years, or on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the prescribed sum, or to both.\n\nThe wording of Section 22 actually creates eighteen ways in which handling may be committed, This may create a problem for prosecutors in that Rule 7 of the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005, and Rule 7 of the Indictments Rules 1971 provide that only a single offence may be charged in one information (in the Magistrates' Court) or in one count of an indictment (in the Crown Court). It can also be difficult to determine the meaning of \"otherwise than in the course of stealing\"; it was decided in R v Hale [1979] 1 Crim LR 596 that the \"appropriation\" in theft may be a continuing act, so it may be difficult to determine whether a theft has been completed.\nApart from the apparent difficulties of specifying a charge that does not offend against the rule against duplicity, it has been said that \"in practice almost anything a person does with stolen goods may be classified as a handling\".\n\nSection 27(3) of the Theft Act 1968 introduces a rare exception to the rule against admissibility of previous criminal conduct in the case of this offence. Evidence may be adduced (but only if handling is the only charge faced by the defendant) that the defendant (a) has been involved in similar conduct within the previous twelve months AND (b) has a previous conviction for handling within five years. This is to counter repeated defences of \"innocent dealing\" as may be put forward by dishonest pawnbrokers. If the defendant is facing other charges, evidence of previous bad character may be admissible under Section 98 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.\n\nThis offence is created by section 21(1) of the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.\n\nIn Scotland, this crime is called reset. It includes property that was taken by theft or robbery as well as property taken by breaches of trust including embezzlement, fraud and willful imposition.\n\nThe offence of handling stolen property is created by section 17(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act, 2001.\n\nIn the United States, Receipt of stolen property is a federal crime under , defined as knowingly receiving, concealing, or disposing of stolen property with a value of at least $5,000 that also constitutes interstate commerce (i.e., has been transported across state lines).\n\nA person can be found guilty of that offense only if all of the following facts are proven:\n\nThe government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the person either received, concealed, stored, sold, or disposed of the stolen property.\n\nTo be guilty of the offense, a person must know that the property had been stolen, but he need not know that it was moving as, or constituted a part of, interstate commerce. The term \"interstate commerce\" merely refers to the movement of property from one U.S. state into another; and it is sufficient if the property has recently moved interstate as a result of a transaction or a series of related transactions that have not been fully completed or consummated at the time of the person's acts as alleged.\n\nAll US states also have laws regarding receipt of stolen property; however, there usually is no minimum dollar amount in many jurisdictions, and, of course, the requirement in Federal law regarding interstate commerce does not apply. Also, in many states (Ohio, for example), the burden to prove criminal intent is not as stringent or is nonexistent. This means that one can be charged with the crime - usually a minor degree of felony - even if the person did not know the item in question was stolen. In the Ohio case of \"State v. Awad\", the goods did not need to actually be stolen, just represented as such.\n\nReceiving stolen property and possession of stolen property are treated as separate offenses in some jurisdictions. The distinguishing element is when the person knew that the property was stolen. If the person knew that the property was stolen at the time he received it, the crime is receiving stolen property. If the person did not know the property was stolen at the time she received it but found out after receiving possession, the crime is possession of stolen property.\n\nThe state must prove that the defendant received or possessed the property for a dishonest purpose. If, for example, the person acquired possession for the purpose of returning the property to its lawful owner, no crime has been committed.\n\n"}
{"id": "1609192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1609192", "title": "Post-Soviet states", "text": "Post-Soviet states\n\nThe post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, and in Russian as the \"near abroad\" (discussed below) are the states that emerged and re-emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its breakup in 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union after the Cold War. The three Baltic states were the first to declare their independence, between March and May 1990, claiming continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1940. The remaining 12 republics all subsequently seceded. 12 of the 15 states, excluding the Baltic states, initially formed the CIS and most joined CSTO, while the Baltic states focused on European Union and NATO membership.\n\nSeveral disputed states with varying degrees of recognition exist within the territory of the former Soviet Union: Transnistria in eastern Moldova, Abkhazia and South Ossetia in northern Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh in southwestern Azerbaijan. Since 2014, the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in Eastern Ukraine have claimed independence. All of these unrecognised states except Nagorno-Karabakh depend on Russian armed support and financial aid. Nagorno-Karabakh is integrated to Armenia, which also maintains close cooperation with Russia. Prior to the annexation of Crimea to Russia in March 2014, which is not recognized by most countries, it briefly declared itself an independent state.\n\nIn the political language of Russia and some other post-Soviet states, the near abroad refers to the newly independent republics (other than Russia itself) which emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. \"Near abroad\" became more widely used in English, usually to assert Russia's right to have major influence in the region, but also for marketing purposes by various companies. Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared the region Russia's \"sphere of influence\", and strategically vital for Russia. The concept has been compared to the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nThe 15 post-Soviet states are typically divided into the following five groupings. Each of these regions has its own common set of traits, owing not only to geographic and cultural factors but also to that region's history in relation to Russia. In addition, there are a number of de facto independent, but internationally unrecognized states (see the section Separatist conflicts below).\n\nArea includes land and water.\n\nThe dissolution of the Soviet Union took place as a result and against the backdrop of general economic stagnation, even regression. As the Gosplan, which had set up production chains to cross SSR lines, broke down, the inter-republic economic connections were also disrupted, leading to even more serious breakdown of the post-Soviet economies.\n\nMost of the formerly Soviet states began the transition to a market economy from a command economy in 1990-1991 and made efforts to rebuild and restructure their economic systems, with varying results. In all, the process triggered severe economic declines, with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) dropping by more than 40% overall between 1990 and 1995. This decline in GDP was much more intense than the 27% decline that the United States suffered in the wake of the Great Depression between 1930 and 1934. The reconfiguration of public finance in compliance with capitalist principles resulted in dramatically reduced spending on health, education and other social programs, leading to a sharp increase in poverty and economic inequality. The economic shocks associated with wholesale privatization resulted in the excess deaths of roughly 1 million working age individuals throughout the former Soviet bloc in the 1990s. A study by economist Steven Rosefielde asserts that 3.4 million Russians died premature deaths from 1990 to 1998, partly as the result of \"shock therapy\" imposed by the Washington consensus.\n\nThe initial transition decline was eventually arrested by the cumulative effect of market reforms, and after 1995 the economy in the post-Soviet states began to recover, with GDP switching from negative to positive growth rates. By 2007, 10 of the 15 post-Soviet states had recovered and reached GDP greater than what they had in 1991. Only Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan had GDP significantly below the 1991 level. The recovery in Russia was marginal, with GDP in 2006-2007 just nudging above the 1991 level. Combined with the aftershocks of the 1998 economic crisis it led to a return of more interventionist economic policies by Vladimir Putin's administration. Some academic studies show that many former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries still have not caught up to their levels of output during the twilight of the Soviet era.\n\nChange in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in constant prices, 1991-2015\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Economy of most Soviet republics started to decline in 1989-1990, thus indices for 1991 don't match pre-reform maximums.\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>The year when GDP decline switched to GDP growth.\n\nList of the present Gross domestic product (GDP) (figures are given in 2013 United States dollars for the year 2013 according to The World Factbook):\n\nThe post-Soviet states listed according to their Human Development Index scores in 2017 (the report was launched in October 2018).\n\nVery High Human Development:\nHigh Human Development:\nMedium Human Development:\n\nA number of regional organizations and cooperating blocs have sprung up since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Only organizations that are mainly (or completely) composed of post-Soviet states are listed in this section; organizations with wider memberships are not discussed. The 15 post-Soviet states are divided in their participation to the regional blocs:\n\nThe Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) consists of 10 former Soviet Republics that differ in their membership status. As of December 2010, 9 countries have ratified the CIS charter and are full CIS members (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Moldova, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan), one country (Turkmenistan) is an associate member and two countries (Georgia, Ukraine) left the organization in 2009 and in 2018. In 2014, Ukraine declined its CIS chairmanship and considered withdrawal from the organization.\n\nIn 1994, the CIS countries agreed to create a free trade area, but the agreements were never signed. On October 19, 2011 Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, and Ukraine signed a free trade agreement. Uzbekistan joined the free trade area in 2013.\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Community (EURASEC), formerly the CIS Customs Union, was established by Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Ukraine and Moldova have observer status in the community; however, Ukraine has declared its desire not to become a full member state. Because having common borders with the rest of the community is a prerequisite for full membership, Moldova is barred from seeking it. Uzbekistan applied for membership in October 2005, when the process of merging Central Asian Cooperation Organization and the Eurasian Economic Community began; it joined on 25 January 2006. Uzbekistan subsequently suspended its membership in 2008.\n\nOn 10 October 2014 an agreement on the termination of the Eurasian Economic Community was signed in Minsk after a session of the Interstate Council of the EAEC. The Eurasian Economic Community was terminated from 1 January 2015 in connection with the launch of the Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nRussia, Belarus, Kazakhstan created a customs union that entered into force in July 2010. Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan indicated interest in joining at the time. Russia has been eager for Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine to join the custom union instead of the European Union, and the Moldovan break-away state of Transnistria has supported this. In 2013, Kyrgyzstan and Armenia announced plans to seek membership, but division over the issue in Ukraine led to the 2014 Ukrainian revolution after the Ukrainian government backed out of an EU Eastern Partnership in favor of the union. In 2014, voters in the Moldovan autonomous region of Gagauzia rejected closer ties to the EU in favor of the union.\n\nOn 1 January 2012, Russia, Kazakhstan and Belarus established the Single Economic Space which ensures the effective functioning of a single market for goods, services, capital and labour, and to establish coherent industrial, transport, energy and agricultural policies. The agreement included a roadmap for future integration and established the Eurasian Economic Commission (modelled on the European Commission). The Eurasian Economic Commission serves as the regulatory agency for the Eurasian Customs Union, the Single Economic Space and the Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nThe Eurasian Economic Union is an economic union of post-Soviet states. The treaty aiming for the establishment of the EAEU was signed on 29 May 2014 by the leaders of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia, and came into force on 1 January 2015. Treaties aiming for Armenia's and Kyrgyzstan's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union were signed on 9 October 2014 and 23 December respectively. Armenia's accession treaty came into force on 2 January 2015. Although Kyrgyzstan's accession treaty will not come into force until May 2015, provided it has been ratified, it will participate in the EAEU from the day of its establishment as an acceding state. Moldova and Tajikistan are prospective members.\n\nSeven CIS member states, namely Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Armenia, have enhanced their military cooperation, establishing the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), this being an expansion of the previous Collective Security Treaty (CST). Uzbekistan which (alongside Georgia and Azerbaijan) withdrew from the CST in 1999, joined GUAM. Then in 2005 it withdrew from GUAM and joined the CSTO in 2006. On 28 June 2012, Uzbekistan suspended its membership in the CSTO.\n\nThree former Soviet states are members of NATO: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. Georgia, where both public opinion and the ruling government favor NATO membership, is in the Intensified Dialogue program with NATO. Ukraine also declared joining NATO as its geopolitical goal once again in 2017 (first time being right after the Orange revolution and in the beginning of presidency of Viktor Yushchenko), after the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, during which the government officially declared neutrality and ceased to seek NATO membership.\n\nOther states in the Partnership for Peace and Individual Partnership Action Plan program include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nFour member states, namely Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova established the GUAM group that was largely seen as intending to counter Russian dominance in the region. Notably, these four nations do not participate in any of the other\nregional organizations that sprang up in the region since the dissolution of the Soviet Union (other\nthan the CIS).\n\nThe Union of Russia and Belarus was originally formed on 2 April 1996 under the name \"Commonwealth of Russia and Belarus\", before being tightened further on 8 December 1999. It was initiated by the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko. On paper, the Union of Russia and Belarus intends further integration, beyond the scope of mere cooperation, including the introduction of the ruble as a common currency.\n\nThe Economic Cooperation Organization was originally formed in 1985 by Turkey, Iran and Pakistan but in 1992 the organization was expanded to include Afghanistan and the six primarily Muslim former Soviet republics: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.\n\nThe post-Soviet disputed states of Abkhazia, Artsakh, South Ossetia, and Transnistria are all members of the Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations which aims to forge closer integration.\n\nThe Community of Democratic Choice (CDC) was formed in December 2005 at the primary instigation of Ukraine and Georgia, and composed of six post-Soviet states (Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova, and the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania) and three other countries of Eastern and Central Europe (Slovenia, Romania and the Republic of Macedonia). The Black Sea Forum (BSF) is a closely related organization. Observer countries include Armenia, Bulgaria, and Poland.\n\nJust like GUAM before it, this forum is largely seen as intending to counteract Russian influence in the area. This is the only international forum centered in the post-Soviet space in which the Baltic states also participate. In addition, the other three post-Soviet states in it are all members of GUAM.\n\nThe Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), is composed of China and five post-Soviet states, namely Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The organization was founded in 2001, though its predecessor, the Shanghai Five grouping, has existed since 1996. Its aims revolve around security-related issues such as border\ndemarcation, terrorism and energy.\n\n\n\n\nApart from above, the former Soviet republics also hold membership in a number of multinational organizations such as:\n\nRegarding political freedom in the former Soviet republics, Freedom House's 2015 report listed the following:\n\nSimilarly, the Worldwide Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders in 2015, recorded the following as regards press freedom:\n\nIt has been remarked that several post-Soviet states have not changed leadership since their independence, such as Nursultan Nazarbayev in Kazakhstan and Islam Karimov in Uzbekistan, until his death in September 2016. All of these had originally more limited terms but through decrees or referendums prolonged their stay in office (a practice also followed by Presidents Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus and Emomalii Rahmon of Tajikistan) Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan had likewise served as President since its independence until he was forced to resign as a result of the Kyrgyz revolution of 2005. Saparmurat Niyazov in Turkmenistan ruled from independence until his death in 2006, creating a personality cult around himself.\n\nThe issue of dynastical succession has been another element affecting the politics of some post-Soviet States. Heydar Aliyev, after constructing an extensive and ongoing cult of personality, handed the Presidency of Azerbaijan to his son, Ilham Aliyev. Theories about the children of other leaders in Central Asia being groomed for succession abound. The participation of Akayev's son and daughter in the 2005 Kyrgyz parliamentary elections boosted fears of dynastic succession being used in Kyrgyzstan as well, and may have contributed to the anti-Akayev climate that led to his overthrow.\n\nEconomic, political, national, military, and social problems have all been factors in separatism in the Post-Soviet space. In many cases, problems due to factors such as ethnic divisions existed before the fall of the Soviet Union, and upon the fall of the union were brought into the open. Such territories and resulting military conflicts have so far been:\n\n\n\nCivil wars unrelated to separatist movements have occurred twice in the region:\n\nSince 2003, a number of (largely) peaceful \"colour revolutions\" have happened in some post-Soviet states after disputed elections, with popular protests bringing into power the former opposition.\n\nThere is a significant Russophone population in most of the post-Soviet states, whose political position as an ethnic minority varies from country to country. While Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, in addition to Russia, have kept Russian as an official language, the language lost its status in other post-Soviet states after the end of the Soviet Union. It maintains semi-official status in all CIS member states, because it is the organisation's official working language, but in the three Baltic States, the Russian language is not recognized in any official capacity. Georgia, since its departure from the CIS in 2009, has begun operating its government almost exclusively in the Georgian language.\n\nWhile the Soviet system placed severe restrictions on religious intellectual life, traditions continued to survive. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Islamic movements have emerged alongside ethnic and secular ones. Vitaly Naumkin gives the following assessment: \"Throughout the time of change, Islam has served as a symbol of identity, a force for mobilization, and a pressure for democracy. This is one of the few social disasters that the church has survived, in which it was not the cause. But if successful politically, it faces economic challenges beyond its grasp.\"\n\nThe Central Asian states (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) plus Azerbaijan from Southern caucasus are Muslim, except for their dwindling Russian and other European minorities. The Baltic States are historically Western Christian (Protestant and Roman Catholic), which adds another layer of pro-Western orientation to those countries, although the vast majority of what was the Protestant population (Estonia and northern Latvia) there is now irreligious. The dominant religion in the remaining former Soviet countries (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, Russia, and Ukraine) is Orthodox Christianity. In most countries, religiosity has increased since the Soviet collapse.\n\nThe Soviet Union promoted environmental sentiments and had a constitutional clause on environmental protection. Some environmental strides were made, such as the banning of lead-based paint and gasoline in the 20th century. However, there was environmental degradation in the former Soviet Union, which is attributed to rapid industrialization and a lack of institutions that were able to curb pollution levels. \n\nRussia has an expansive amount of land which contains a high amount of natural resources and biodiversity. Protected natural areas, or \"zapovedniki,\" were created under the Soviet Union. Soviet leaders attributed former pollution and environmental degradation in Russia to private enterprise and capitalism. However, environmental problems arose in Russia under the Soviets because industrialization was favored over over environmentalism, and there was little discussion on how to properly use resources and they were depreciated. The task of environmental governance was distributed among 15 different ministries. There is controversy among academics as to whether environmental destruction under the Soviet Union can be attributed to Marxist ideology or to the industrialization push.\n\nIn 1988, there was the formation of the State Committee on Environmental Protection, or the \"Goskompriroda\". The 1990s saw experiments in taxing pollution of various forms, though this was largely ineffective due to the low charge levels and inflation, as well as more areas of protected land, but there was difficulty overseeing these areas due to small budgets. In 1991 under the independent Russian Federation, the Federal Act on the Protection of the Natural Environment was passed and the State Committee on Environmental Protection became the Ministry of the Environment and developed sustainable development goals. In 1996, Yeltsin demoted the Ministry of the Environment to the State Committee on Environmental Protection, and in 2000 Putin ends the State Committee on Environmental Protection and the Federal Forestry Service and tasks the Ministry of Natural Resources with their responsibilities. In 2001, to the ire of many environmental advocates, Russia passed a law which allowed the acceptance, treatment, and storage the nuclear fuel of other nations for profit. The Environmental Doctrine was passed in 2002, the Water Code was passed in 2006, and the Forest Code was passed in 2007, though these policies have been critiqued for the difficulty in enforcing them. Today, Russia has a low population density with most citizens gathered in the cities, so environmental degradation is concentrated in certain areas. Putin is criticized by environmental advocates for prioritizing economic gain over environmental protection, and there are high levels of greenhouse gas emissions and frequent oil spills.\n\nEver since the dissolution of the Soviet Union a certain number of people have expressed a longing for the Soviet period and its values. The level of post-Soviet nostalgia varies across the former republics. For example, certain groups of people may blend the Soviet and post-Soviet experience in their daily lives..\n\nAccording to July 2012 polling in Ukraine by RATING, 42% of respondents supported the formation of a unified state of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus; earlier in 2012 this support had been 48%.\n\nA 2016 poll of Russian citizens conducted by Levada Center showed that the majority viewed the collapse of the USSR negatively and felt that it could have been avoided, and an even greater number would openly welcome a revival of the Soviet system.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "30953874", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30953874", "title": "Reactive destocking", "text": "Reactive destocking\n\nReactive destocking in supply chain management is a reduction of the inventory when expected demand goes down. When a company is only doing reactive destocking, the desired inventory to sales ratio, remains unchanged. Reactive destocking in general is done by operational managers of the logistical activities, without additional instructions. The inventory can include finished products, raw materials and/or goods in process.\n\nThe term \"reactive destocking\" is relevant when it is used in connection with active destocking. Active destocking refers to an active decision to reduce the inventory to sales ratio of a company. In general, active destocking is done following an autonomous, often financial decision by a company to improve its efficiency, freeing up cash and reducing its costs. Decisions for active destocking in general are made by financial executives or general managers.\n\nThe terms \"reactive de-stocking\" and \"active de-stocking\" were first used in an article about the Lehman wave, published by Dutch researchers in 2009.\n\nA Lehman wave refers to an economy-wide fluctuation in production and in economic activity with a wavelength of between 12 and 18 months, driven by a sudden major disruption of the economic system. The Lehman Wave is a dampened, wave-like fluctuation around equilibrium. The amplitude of the Lehman wave is larger for a business that is further away from its end market than for a business that is closer to its end market, which difference is caused by cumulative destocking of the intermediate supply chain.\n\nThe first described Lehman wave was caused by global active destocking, followed by reactive destocking after the financial panic following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008. The Lehman Wave can have strong effects on the sales volume and therefore on the profitability of companies higher in the value chain.\n\nActive destocking caused the Lehman wave and reactive destocking deepened it. The strong dip in the manufacturing industry seen at the end of 2008 was caused by cumulative and synchronized active destocking followed by reactive destocking, triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Said bankruptcy created a sudden peak in the Libor interest rate, causing the banks to recall credit and companies to start freeing up cash by active destocking, so reducing their stocks. When the customers of a company start active destocking it is experienced by said company as lower demand and said company will respond by doing reactive destocking. End markets also responded by going down, but slower and in most markets not so strongly. The drop in end market plus the active and reactive destocking created a giant damped wave, the so-called Lehman wave. \n\nWhen a company takes an active destocking decision, said company expresses the wish to reduce the inventory to sales ratio. In a real world, the actual inventory can first go up, before going down, depending on the behavior of the other players in the supply chain.\n\nActive and reactive destocking explains why some companies can see a strong dip in sales while their end markets are fairly stable. If the supply chain between a company and its end-customer would have a stock depth of \"250 days' sales\", meaning that it takes at least 250 days for a molecule to travel from a companies' warehouse to the end consumer, and if each firm in such a 250-day supply chain decides to do active destocking of 12%, an amount of stock equal to 30 days’ sales (a whole month) is taken out of the chain. For a company at the beginning of the supply chain this will result in either a business standstill for a whole month or a 33% decline during three months.\nThis discovery of active destocking, reactive destocking and the Lehman Wave can have important implications for manufacturing scheduling, inventory management, work force management and budgeting.\n\nWhile the existence of the bullwhip effect has been extensively documented (e.g., Forrester (1961), Sterman (1989), and Lee et al. (1997), Croson and Donohue (2006)), there have been arguments about its existence in the overall economy or in supply chains encompassing numerous companies. Cachon et al. (2007) recently argued that no evidence of the existence of the bullwhip effect could be found. Fransoo and Wouters (2000) and Chen and Lee (2009) argue that in order to observe the bullwhip effect it is crucial to measure it correctly. Both these papers argue that improper aggregation essentially takes away the opportunity to observe the bullwhip effect. In the beer distribution game (Sterman, 1989), the bullwhip effect is created by a single pulse. In Sterman's experiment, this single pulse is an increase in the demand level. In the case of the Lehman wave that started in September 2008 the single pulse is active destocking, in this case a synchronized decrease in the target inventory-over-sales level along the entire supply chain. A reduction of inventories under stable or slightly decreasing sales can only be achieved if purchases are reduced or postponed. As a consequence of the decision to reduce inventory, therefore, many companies substantially reduced their purchases of supplies or raw materials. Obviously, companies further upstream in the supply chain were hit more than companies downstream. Therefore, the Lehman wave can be described as a synchronized bullwhip caused by active destocking, followed by reactive destocking.\n"}
{"id": "43854", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43854", "title": "Reality", "text": "Reality\n\nReality is the sum or aggregate of all that is real or existent, as opposed to that which is merely imaginary. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. In physical terms, reality is the totality of the universe, known and unknown. Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of ontology, which is a major branch of metaphysics in the Western philosophical tradition. Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the philosophy of science, philosophy of religion, philosophy of mathematics, and philosophical logic. These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., Physicalism), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g., Idealism), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether God exists, whether numbers and other abstract objects exist, and whether possible worlds exist. \n\nA common colloquial usage would have \"reality\" mean \"perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward reality\", as in \"My reality is not your reality.\" This is often used just as a colloquialism indicating that the parties to a conversation agree, or should agree, not to quibble over deeply different conceptions of what is real. For example, in a religious discussion between friends, one might say (attempting humor), \"You might disagree, but in my reality, everyone goes to heaven.\"\n\nReality can be defined in a way that links it to worldviews or parts of them (conceptual frameworks): Reality is the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not. It is what a world view (whether it be based on individual or shared human experience) ultimately attempts to describe or map.\n\nCertain ideas from physics, philosophy, sociology, literary criticism, and other fields shape various theories of reality. One such belief is that there simply and literally \"is\" no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality. Such attitudes are summarized in the popular statement, \"Perception is reality\" or \"Life is how you perceive reality\" or \"reality is what you can get away with\" (Robert Anton Wilson), and they indicate anti-realism – that is, the view that there is no objective reality, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.\n\nMany of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined culturally and socially. This idea was elaborated by Thomas Kuhn in his book \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\" (1962). \"The Social Construction of Reality\", a book about the sociology of knowledge written by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, was published in 1966. It explained how knowledge is acquired and used for the comprehension of reality. Out of all the realities, the reality of everyday life is the most important one since our consciousness requires us to be completely aware and attentive to the experience of everyday life.\n\nPhilosophy addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality: the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the mind (as well as language and culture) and reality.\n\nOn the one hand, ontology is the study of being, and the central topic of the field is couched, variously, in terms of being, existence, \"what is\", and reality. The task in ontology is to describe the most general categories of reality and how they are interrelated. If a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept \"reality\", it would be done under this heading. As explained above, some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence. In fact, many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term \"real\" and \"reality\" in discussing ontological issues. But for those who would treat \"is real\" the same way they treat \"exists\", one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence (or reality) is a property of objects. It has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is \"not\" a property at all, though this view has lost some ground in recent decades.\n\nOn the other hand, particularly in discussions of objectivity that have feet in both metaphysics and epistemology, philosophical discussions of \"reality\" often concern the ways in which reality is, or is not, in some way \"dependent upon\" (or, to use fashionable jargon, \"constructed\" out of) mental and cultural factors such as perceptions, beliefs, and other mental states, as well as cultural artifacts, such as religions and political movements, on up to the vague notion of a common cultural world view, or .\n\nThe view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs, perceptions, etc., is called realism. More specifically, philosophers are given to speaking about \"realism \"about\"\" this and that, such as realism about universals or realism about the external world. Generally, where one can identify any class of object, the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions, beliefs, language, or any other human artifact, one can speak of \"realism \"about\"\" that object.\n\nOne can also speak of \"anti\"-realism about the same objects. \"Anti-realism\" is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism. Perhaps the first was idealism, so called because reality was said to be in the mind, or a product of our \"ideas\". Berkeleyan idealism is the view, propounded by the Irish empiricist George Berkeley, that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind. In this view, one might be tempted to say that reality is a \"mental construct\"; this is not quite accurate, however, since, in Berkeley's view, perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by God. By the 20th century, views similar to Berkeley's were called phenomenalism. Phenomenalism differs from Berkeleyan idealism primarily in that Berkeley believed that minds, or souls, are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas, whereas varieties of phenomenalism, such as that advocated by Russell, tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions, memories, etc., and that there is no mind or soul over and above such mental events. Finally, anti-realism became a fashionable term for \"any\" view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts. The view that the so-called external world is really merely a social, or cultural, artifact, called social constructionism, is one variety of anti-realism. Cultural relativism is the view that social issues such as morality are not absolute, but at least partially cultural artifact.\n\nA correspondence theory of knowledge about what exists claims that \"true\" knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent. For example, the scientific method can verify that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists. Many humans can point to the Rocky Mountains and say that this mountain range exists, and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it.\n\nThe nature of being is a perennial topic in metaphysics. For, instance Parmenides taught that reality was a single unchanging Being, whereas Heraclitus wrote that all things flow. The 20th century philosopher Heidegger thought previous philosophers have lost sight the question of Being (qua Being) in favour of the questions of beings (existing things), so that a return to the Parmenidean approach was needed. An ontological catalogue is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality. The question of whether or not existence is a predicate has been discussed since the Early Modern period, not least in relation to the ontological argument for the existence of God. Existence, \"that\" something is, has been contrasted with \"essence\", the question of \"what\" something is.\nSince existence without essence seems blank, it associated with nothingness by philosophers such as Hegel. Nihilism represents an extremely negative view of being, the absolute a positive one.\n\nThe question of direct or \"naïve\" realism, as opposed to indirect or \"representational\" realism, arises in the philosophy of perception and of mind out of the debate over the nature of conscious experience; the epistemological question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by neural processes in our brain. Naïve realism is known as \"direct\" realism when developed to counter \"indirect\" or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism, the philosophical position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation, a miniature virtual-reality replica of the world.\n\nTimothy Leary coined the influential term Reality Tunnel, by which he means a kind of representative realism. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence \"Truth is in the eye of the beholder\". His ideas influenced the work of his friend Robert Anton Wilson.\n\nThe status of abstract entities, particularly numbers, is a topic of discussion in mathematics.\n\nIn the philosophy of mathematics, the best known form of realism about numbers is Platonic realism, which grants them abstract, immaterial existence. Other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe.\n\nAnti-realist stances include formalism and fictionalism.\n\nSome approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others. Finitism rejects infinite quantities. Ultra-finitism accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount. Constructivism and intuitionism are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed, but reject the use of the principle of the excluded middle to prove existence by reductio ad absurdum.\n\nThe traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract (immaterial, intelligible) realm of numbers has existed \"in addition to\" the physical (sensible, concrete) world. A recent development is the mathematical universe hypothesis, the theory that \"only\" a mathematical world exists, with the finite, physical world being an illusion within it.\n\nAn extreme form of realism about mathematics is the mathematical multiverse hypothesis advanced by Max Tegmark. Tegmark's sole postulate is: \"All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically\". That is, in the sense that \"in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world\". The hypothesis suggests that worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions, physical constants, or altogether different equations should be considered real. The theory can be considered a form of Platonism in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities, but can also be considered a mathematical monism in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects.\n\nThe problem of universals is an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, properties, kinds or relations, such as being male/female, solid/liquid/gas or a certain colour, that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. For example, Scott, Pat, and Chris have in common the universal quality of \"being human\" or \"humanity\".\n\nThe realist school claims that universals are real – they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are Platonic realism and Aristotelian realism. \"Platonic realism\" is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. \"Aristotelian realism\", on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.\n\nNominalism and conceptualism are the main forms of anti-realism about universals.\n\nA traditional realist position in ontology is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. Idealists deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some anti-realists whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.\n\nKant, in the \"Critique of Pure Reason\", described time as an \"a priori\" notion that, together with other \"a priori\" notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although\nspace and time are held to be \"transcendentally ideal\" in this sense, they are also \"empirically real\", i.e. not mere illusions.\n\nIdealist writers such as J. M. E. McTaggart in \"The Unreality of Time\" have argued that time is an illusion.\n\nAs well as differing about the reality of time as a whole, metaphysical theories of time can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the past, present and future separately.\n\nTime, and the related concepts of process and evolution are central to the system-building metaphysics of A. N. Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.\n\nThe term \"possible world\" goes back to Leibniz's theory of possible worlds, used to analyse necessity, possibility, and similar modal notions. Modal realism is the view, notably propounded by David Kellogg Lewis, that all possible worlds are as real as the actual world. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an infinite set of logically possible worlds, some \"nearer\" to the actual world and some more remote. Other theorists may use the Possible World framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically.\nPossible world theory is related to alethic logic: a proposition is \"necessary\" if it is true in all possible worlds, and \"possible\" if it is true in at least one. The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science.\n\nThe philosophical implications of a physical TOE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical physicalism is true, a physical TOE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.\n\nThe \"system building\" style of metaphysics attempts to answer \"all\" the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. Plato and Aristotle could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building \"scope\" of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist \"method\" of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure \"a priori\" reason. Examples from the early modern period include the Leibniz's Monadology, Descartes's Dualism, Spinoza's Monism. Hegel's Absolute idealism and Whitehead's Process philosophy were later systems.\n\nOther philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a TOE, for instance Stephen Hawking wrote in \"A Brief History of Time\" that even if we had a TOE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, \"What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?\"\n\nOn a much broader and more subjective level, private experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one individual and hence is called phenomenological. While this\nform of reality might be common to others as well, it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else. Much of the kind of experience deemed spiritual occurs on this level of reality.\n\nPhenomenology is a philosophical method developed in the early years of the twentieth century by Edmund Husserl and a circle of followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. Subsequently, phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's work.\n\nThe word \"phenomenology\" comes from the Greek \"phainómenon\", meaning \"that which appears\", and \"lógos\", meaning \"study\". In Husserl's conception, phenomenology is primarily concerned with making the structures of consciousness, and the phenomena which appear in acts of consciousness, objects of systematic reflection and analysis. Such reflection was to take place from a highly modified \"first person\" viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to \"my\" consciousness, but to any consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human knowledge, including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a \"rigorous science\".\n\nHusserl's conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed not only by himself, but also by his student and assistant Martin Heidegger, by existentialists, such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Jean-Paul Sartre, and by other philosophers, such as Paul Ricoeur, Emmanuel Levinas, and Dietrich von Hildebrand.\n\nSkeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality is very different from what we think it is; or at least that we cannot prove it is not. Examples include:\n\n\nJain philosophy postulates that seven tattva (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality. These seven \"tattva\" are:\n\nScientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world described by science (perhaps ideal science) is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question \"how is the success of science to be explained?\" The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are not directly observable discussed by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as directly observable entities, as opposed to instrumentalism. The most used and studied scientific theories today state more or less the truth.\n\n\"Realism\" in the sense used by physicists does not equate to realism in metaphysics.\nThe latter is the claim that the world is mind-independent: that even if the results of a measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer. Furthermore, a mind-independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or momentum. A property can be \"dispositional\" (or potential), i.e. it can be a tendency: in the way that glass objects tend to break, or are disposed to break, even if they do not \"actually\" break. Likewise, the mind-independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability. Such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic, without being realistic in the physicist's sense of \"local realism\" (which would require that a single value be produced with certainty).\n\nA closely related term is counterfactual definiteness (CFD), used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured).\n\nLocal realism is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of general relativity, and of electrodynamics; but quantum mechanics has shown that quantum entanglement is possible. This was rejected by Einstein, who proposed the EPR paradox, but it was subsequently quantified by Bell's inequalities. If Bell's inequalities are violated, either local realism \"or\" counterfactual definiteness must be incorrect; but some physicists dispute that experiments have demonstrated Bell's violations, on the grounds that the sub-class of inhomogeneous Bell inequalities has not been tested or due to experimental limitations in the tests. Different interpretations of quantum mechanics violate different parts of local realism and/or counterfactual definiteness.\n\nThe quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the mind–body problem in the context of quantum mechanics. Since quantum mechanics involves quantum superpositions, which are not perceived by observers, some interpretations of quantum mechanics place conscious observers in a special position.\n\nThe founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, Wolfgang Pauli and Werner Heisenberg believed that it was the observer that produced collapse. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by Niels Bohr, was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by Albert Einstein. Pauli accepted the term, and described quantum mechanics as \"lucid mysticism\".\n\nHeisenberg and Bohr always described quantum mechanics in logical positivist terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his complementarity, for example. He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences – which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy.\n\nEugene Wigner reformulated the \"Schrödinger's cat\" thought experiment as \"Wigner's friend\" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation. Commonly known as \"consciousness causes collapse\", this interpretation of quantum mechanics states that observation by a conscious observer is what makes the wave function collapse.\n\nThe multiverse is the hypothetical set of multiple possible universes (including the historical universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James. In the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), one of the mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics, there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe.\n\nThe structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology and fiction, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called \"alternative universes\", \"quantum universes\", \"interpenetrating dimensions\", \"parallel dimensions\", \"parallel worlds\", \"alternative realities\", \"alternative timelines\", and \"dimensional planes\", among others.\n\nA theory of everything (TOE) is a putative theory of theoretical physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of \"any\" experiment that could be carried out \"in principle\". The theory of everything is also called the final theory. Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that general relativity and quantum mechanics are hard to unify. This is one of the unsolved problems in physics.\n\nInitially, the term \"theory of everything\" was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of Ijon Tichy, a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem's science fiction stories of the 1960s, was known to work on the \"General Theory of Everything\". Physicist John Ellis claims to have introduced the term into the technical literature in an article in \"Nature\" in 1986. Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of quantum physics to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions and of all particles of nature: general relativity for gravitation, and the standard model of elementary particle physics – which includes quantum mechanics – for electromagnetism, the two nuclear interactions, and the known elementary particles.\n\nCurrent candidates for a theory of everything include string theory, M theory, and loop quantum gravity.\n\nVirtual reality (VR) is a computer-simulated environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world, as well as in imaginary worlds.\n\nThe Virtuality Continuum is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a Virtuality, and the completely real: Reality. The reality-virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects. It has been described as a concept in new media and computer science, but in fact it could be considered a matter of anthropology. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.\n\nThe area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is the so-called Mixed reality. This in turn is said to consist of both Augmented Reality, where the virtual augments the real, and Augmented virtuality, where the real augments the virtual.\nCyberspace, the world's computer systems considered as an interconnected whole, can be thought of as a virtual reality; for instance, it is portrayed as such in the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson and others. Second life and MMORPGs such as \"World of Warcraft\" are examples of artificial environments or virtual worlds (falling some way short of full virtual reality) in cyberspace.\n\nOn the Internet, \"real life\" refers to life in the real world. It generally references life or consensus reality, in contrast to an environment seen as fiction or fantasy, such as virtual reality, lifelike experience, dreams, novels, or movies. Online, the acronym \"IRL\" stands for \"in real life\", with the meaning \"not on the Internet\". Sociologists engaged in the study of the Internet have determined that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem \"quaint\", noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and \"reality\". The abbreviation \"RL\" stands for \"real life\". For example, one can speak of \"meeting in RL\" someone whom one has met in a chat or on an Internet forum. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to \"RL problems\".\n\n\n\n"}

The format consists of a series of cycling events on closed roads around London and Surrey for amateur cyclists and professionals, culminating in the London–Surrey Classic, a one-day international road cycling.\n\nPrudential RideLondon is composed of a number of events taking place the weekend following the end of the Tour de France at the end of July every year.\n\nTaking place on the Saturday, the Prudential RideLondon FreeCycle offers an opportunity for people of all ages to cycle on traffic-free roads in Central London, passing landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, the Bank of England, the Houses of Parliament and St Paul's Cathedral. Alongside the FreeCycle route, there are also seven festival zones, all of which have a variety of bike-based activates riders can get involved in.\n\nThe Prudential RideLondon Classique is a UCI Women's WorldTour race on the Saturday evening on a 5.5 km circuit in central London, beginning and finishing on The Mall. The women’s elite race, previously known as the Grand Prix pro race, was given UCI World Tour Status in 2016 and has the highest ever value prize money for a women’s one-day race. This is also the same prize money as won in the men’s elite race, despite the lessened interest.\n\nThe Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 takes place on the Sunday. Over 25,000 amateur cyclists start in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, then cycle through the capital and onto Surrey's country roads and the Surrey Hills before a finish on The Mall in central London. Many of the riders are sponsored for charities: £12.5 million was raised for charity in 2017.\n\nFirst established in 2016, the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 46 takes place on the Sunday morning. The 46-mile route on traffic-free roads begins at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London and follows the same route as the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 for the first 27 miles before linking to with the last 17 miles through London to the finish in The Mall.\n\nThe Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic on the Sunday, is a UCI WorldTour event which follows largely the same route as the Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 sportive with multiple circuits in and around Dorking.\n\nThe Brompton World Championship first became part of the RideLondon cycling festival in 2015. The event involves 550 Brompton riders racing around a central London circuit on the iconic foldable bikes and ends with a sprint finish on The Mall. Riders are generally dressed in suits, due to the strict no lycra rule in order to reflect the Brompton bikes place in a modern-day commuter lifestyle.\n\nThe prudential RideLondon HandCycle and Junior races are also included in the RideLondon weekend. The elite HandCycle event has been won by Rafal Wilk of Poland in 2016 and 2017 while Christine Reppe of Germany won the women’s elite handcycle in 2017. The amateur handcycle event is for injured veteran servicemen and women. The Junior categories feature boys and girls races for 13–16 years old. \n\nThe origins of RideLondon can be traced back to when London was awarded the rights to stage the 2012 Olympic & Paralympic Games. Subsequently, London has staged a number of cycling events. In 2007, London hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart and also closed roads to create a day-long safe cycling environment in city centre, known at the time as The London Freewheel. This annual one day event continued between 2007-2011 and from 2009 became known as the Mayor of London's Skyride.\n\nAmbition to create a new world-class event for cycling, that could one day rival London's most iconic sporting events such as the London Marathon and the Wimbledon Championships, was born. The aim of the annual event is to include the world's top men, women and hand cyclists racing as part of the international cycling calendar in order to challenge and inspire people from all backgrounds to get on two wheels. In late 2011 and early 2012, Mayor Boris Johnson assessed and formally approved the recommendation to create the event and, at the start of the Olympic year, the search for a suitably qualified and experienced Delivery Partner was launched.\nAfter detailed work, a joint venture including the organisers of London Marathon and the Tour of Britain under the name of the London & Surrey Cycling Partnership was selected to make the event a reality. The event would be delivered in partnership with Surrey County Council and include a route through the Surrey Hills, which also mirrored the London Olympic Games road race. The event is part of the London 2012 Olympic legacy.\n\nIn August 2012, as the Olympic Games drew to a close, the Mayor of London and the London & Surrey Cycling Partnership, alongside British Cycling and double Olympic champion Laura Trott, formally launched RideLondon and called for fans to sign up to the 100-mile challenge.\nThe event's first title sponsor, Prudential, was announced in early 2013 by which time more than 55,000 people had signed up to be one of the first riders to participate in the inaugural RideLondon-Surrey 100. This race is part of the Prudential RideLondon festival weekend with coverage to be broadcast live on BBC and international TV.\n\nThe RideLondon vision was to showcase the capital to nationwide and international audiences, generate economic benefit from participant and spectator expenditure and inspire more people to take up regular cycling.\n\nIn its first year, more than 16,000 people started the RideLondon-Surrey 100, more than 50,000 took part in RideLondon FreeCycle and over 1,000 volunteers helped run the event. 99% of participants rated the event as good or excellent and riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100 raised more than £7 million for charity.\n\nIn 2014, over 16,000 completed the RideLondon-Surrey 100 (shortened to 86 miles due to adverse weather conditions) with 60,000 taking part in the FreeCycle and more than £10 million being raised for charity by riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100. This set a new record for a UK one-day cycling event for a second successive year.\n\nIn response to the huge demand for the event, places were increased by 25 per cent in 2015, with more than 25,000 riders crossing the Start Line in Queen Elizabeth Park Olympic Park on 2 August.\nThis year a new event was also added to the RideLondon cycling festival; the 10th Brompton Bicycle World Championship Final. This event which featured in the RideLondon Grand Prix races in St James's Park and was the first time that the Brompton World Championship Final had been held in London. The event opened with a Le Mans-style start as 500 smartly-dressed competitors from around the world made a mad dash to unfold their bikes before setting off on the circuit. Six Festival Zones (up from five in 2014) in RideLondon FreeCycle offered riders a chance to stop and enjoy a huge range of free bike-based entertainment and to try out many different bike-based activities. The women's RideLondon Grand Prix race was also one of the biggest one-day races on the international calendar and was again televised live by the BBC.\n\nIn 2016, a new 46 mile event was launched by Bradley Wiggins specifically for newer and younger cyclists. The RideLondon-Surrey 46 on traffic-free roads starts at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park, and follows the same route as RideLondon-Surrey 100 for the first 27 miles before taking a new two-mile route, which then links up with the last 17 miles to the finish in The Mall.\n\nA new format for the RideLondon Grand Prix was also announced. From 2016 it is to be held at the Lee Valley Velopark in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park and include handcycle, junior and BMX races for the first time.\n\nIn 2017, the RideLondon-Surrey Classic and RideLondon Classique both gained UCI WorldTour status and became the richest one-day races in cycling offering equal prize money for both the men's and women's races. Riders in the RideLondon-Surrey 100 and RideLondon-Surrey 46 together raised £12.75 million for charity.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis event was an elite women's criterium road race, first held as part of the festival in 2013. The inaugural race was won by Laura Trott from Hannah Barnes.\n\n\n\"top 2\"\n\n\"top 2\"\n\n"}
{"id": "39393158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39393158", "title": "Rosalia (festival)", "text": "Rosalia (festival)\n\nIn the Roman Empire, Rosalia or Rosaria was a festival of roses celebrated on various dates, primarily in May, but scattered through mid-July. The observance is sometimes called a rosatio (\"rose-adornment\") or the dies rosationis, \"day of rose-adornment,\" and could be celebrated also with violets \"(violatio\", an adorning with violets, also \"dies violae\" or \"dies violationis\", \"day of the \"). As a commemoration of the dead, the \"rosatio\" developed from the custom of placing flowers at burial sites. It was among the extensive private religious practices by means of which the Romans cared for their dead, reflecting the value placed on tradition \"(mos maiorum\", \"the way of the ancestors\"), family lineage, and memorials ranging from simple inscriptions to grand public works. Several dates on the Roman calendar were set aside as public holidays or memorial days devoted to the dead.\n\nAs a religious expression, a \"rosatio\" might also be offered to the cult statue of a deity or to other revered objects. In May, the Roman army celebrated the Rosaliae signorum, rose festivals at which they adorned the military standards with garlands. The rose festivals of private associations and clubs are documented by at least forty-one inscriptions in Latin and sixteen in Greek, where the observance is often called a \"rhodismos\".\n\nFlowers were traditional symbols of rejuvenation, rebirth, and memory, with the red and purple of roses and violets felt to evoke the color of blood as a form of propitiation. Their blooming period framed the season of spring, with roses the last of the flowers to bloom and violets the earliest. As part of both festive and funerary banquets, roses adorned \"a strange repast ... of life and death together, considered as two aspects of the same endless, unknown process.\" In some areas of the Empire, the Rosalia was assimilated to floral elements of spring festivals for Dionysus, Adonis and others, but rose-adornment as a practice was not strictly tied to the cultivation of particular deities, and thus lent itself to Jewish and Christian commemoration. Early Christian writers transferred the imagery of garlands and crowns of roses and violets to the cult of the saints.\n\nIn Greece and Rome, wreaths and garlands of flowers and greenery were worn by both men and women for festive occasions. Garlands of roses and violets, combined or singly, adorn erotic scenes, bridal processions, and drinking parties in Greek lyric poetry from the Archaic period onward. In Latin literature, to be \"in the roses and violets\" meant experiencing carefree pleasure. Floral wreaths and garlands \"mark the wearers as celebrants and likely serve as an expression of the beauty and brevity of life itself.\" Roses and violets were the most popular flowers at Rome for wreaths, which were sometimes given as gifts.\n\nFlowers were associated with or offered to some deities, particularly the goddesses Aphrodite (Roman Venus), Persephone (Proserpina), and Chloris (Flora). Roses and fragrances are a special attribute of Aphrodite, and also of Dionysus, particularly in Imperial-era poetry as a wine god for drinking parties or with the presence of Eros (\"Love, Desire\"). The Greek romance novel \"Daphnis and Chloe\" (2nd century AD) describes a pleasure garden, with roses and violets among its abundant flora, centered on a sacred space for Dionysus. At Rome Venus was a goddess of gardens as well as love and beauty. Venus received roses at her ritual cleansing \"(lavatio)\" on April 1 and at the wine festival (Vinalia) celebrated in her honor April 23.\n\nA lavish display of flowers was an expression of conviviality and liberal generosity. An Imperial-era business letter surviving on papyrus attempts to soothe a bridegroom's mother upset that the rose harvest was insufficient to fill her order for the wedding; the suppliers compensated by sending 4,000 narcissus instead of the 2,000 she requested. While flowers were a part of Roman weddings, the bridegroom was more likely than the bride to wear a flower crown; Statius (1st century AD) describes a groom as wearing a wreath of roses, violets, and lilies. When the emperor made a formal arrival \"(adventus)\" at a city, garlands of flowers might be among the gestures of greeting from the welcome delegation. According to an account in the \"Historia Augusta\" (\"presumably fictional\"), the decadent emperor Heliogabalus buried the guests at one of his banquets in an avalanche of rose petals. In Greek culture, the \"phyllobolia\" was the showering of a victorious athlete or bridal couple with leaves or flower petals.\nClassical mythology preserves a number of stories in which blood and flowers are linked in divine metamorphosis. When Adonis, beloved of Aphrodite, was killed by a boar during a hunt, his blood produced a flower. A central myth of the Roman rites of Cybele is the self-castration of her consort Attis, from whose blood a violet-colored flower sprang. In the Gnostic text \"On the Origin of the World\", possibly dating to the early 4th century, the rose was the first flower to come into being, created from the virgin blood of Psyche (\"Soul\") after she united sexually with Eros. In the 4th-century poem \"Cupid Crucified\" by the Gallo-Roman poet Ausonius, the god Cupid (the Roman equivalent of Eros) is tortured in the underworld by goddesses disappointed in love, and the blood from his wounds causes roses to grow.\n\nIn Egyptian religion, funerary wreaths of laurel, palm, feathers, papyrus, or precious metals represented the \"crown of justification\" that the deceased was to receive when he was judged in the Weighing of the Heart ceremony of the afterlife. In the Imperial period, the wreath might be roses, under the influence of the Romanized cult of Isis. The statue of Isis was adorned with roses following the \"Navigium Isidis\", an Imperial holiday March 5 when a ceremonial procession represented the \"sailing\" of Isis. In the \"Metamorphoses\" of Apuleius, the protagonist Lucius is transformed into an ass, and after a journey of redemption returns to human form by eating roses and becoming an initiate into the mysteries of Isis. A festival called the Rhodophoria, preserved in three Greek papyri, is the \"rose-bearing\" probably for Isis, or may be the Greek name for the Rosalia.\n\nRoses had funerary significance in Greece, but were particularly associated with death and entombment among the Romans. In Greece, roses appear on funerary steles, and in epitaphs most often of girls. In Imperial-era Greek epitaphs, the death of an unmarried girl is compared to a budding rose cut down in spring; a young woman buried in her wedding clothes is \"like a rose in a garden\"; an eight-year-old boy is like the rose that is \"the beautiful flower of the Erotes\" (\"Loves\" or Cupids). As a symbol of both blooming youth and mourning, the rose often marks a death experienced as untimely or premature. In the \"Iliad\", Aphrodite anoints Hector's corpse with \"ambrosial oil of roses\" to maintain the integrity of his body against abuse in death. In Greek and Latin poetry, roses grow in the blessed afterlife of the Elysian Fields.\n\nBloodless sacrifice to the dead could include rose garlands and violets as well as libations of wine, and Latin \"purpureus\" expressed the red-to-purple color range of roses and violets particularly as flowers of death. In ancient etymology, \"purpureus\" was thought related to Greek \"porphyreos\" in the sense of suffusing the skin with purple blood in bruising or wounding. The Augustan epic poet Vergil uses the metaphor of a purple flower to describe the premature, bloody deaths of young men in battle: the death of Pallas evokes both the violet of Attis and the hyacinth generated from the dying blood of Apollo's beloved Hyacinthus. Claudian writes of the \"bloody splendor\" of roses in the meadow from which Proserpina will be abducted to the underworld, with hyacinths and violets contributing to the lush flora. Roses and the ominous presence of thorns may intimate bloodshed and mortality even in the discourse of love.\nConversely, roses in a funerary context can allude to festive banqueting, since Roman families met at burial sites on several occasions throughout the year for libations and a shared meal that celebrated both the cherished memory of the beloved dead and the continuity of life through the family line. In Roman tomb painting, red roses often spill bountifully onto light ground. These ageless flowers created a perpetual Rosalia and are an expression of Roman beliefs in the soul's continued existence.\n\nThe bones or ashes of the deceased may be imagined as generating flowers, as in one Latin epitaph that reads:\"Here lies Optatus, a child ennobled by devotion: I pray that his ashes may be violets and roses, and I ask that the Earth, who is his mother now, be light upon him, for the boy's life was a burden to no one.\"\n\nRoses were planted at some tombs and mausoleums, and adjacent grounds might be cultivated as gardens to grow roses for adornment or even produce to sell for cemetery upkeep or administrative costs. In the 19th to the 21st centuries, a profusion of cut and cultivated flowers was still a characteristic of Italian cemeteries to a degree that distinguished them from practice. This difference is one of the Roman Catholic practices criticized by some Protestants, especially in the 19th century, as too \"pagan\" in origin.\n\nAlthough the rose had a long tradition in funerary art, the earliest record of a Roman rose festival named as such dates to the reign of Domitian (81–96 AD), and places the observance on June 20. The inscription was made by a priestly association \"(collegium)\" in Lucania devoted to the woodland god Silvanus. It records vows for the wellbeing of the emperor and prescribes a sacrifice to Silvanus on five occasions in the year, among them the Rosalia. Although Silvanus is typically regarded as a deity of the woods and the wild, Vergil describes him as bearing flowering fennel and lilies. In other inscriptions, three donors to Silvanus had adopted the cultic name \"Anthus\" (Greek \"anthos\", \"flower\") and a fourth, of less certain reading, may have the Latin name \"Florus\", the masculine form of Flora. Since trees are the form of plant life most often emblematic of Silvanus, his connection with flowers is obscure. His female counterparts the Silvanae, primarily found in the Danubian provinces, are sometimes depicted carrying flower pots or wreaths. Through his epithet \"Dendrophorus\", \"Tree-bearer,\" he was linked to the Romanized cult of Attis and Cybele in which celebrants called \"dendrophori\" participated.\n\nWhen well-to-do people wrote a will and made end-of-life preparations, they might set aside funds for the maintenance of their memory and care \"(cura)\" after death, including rose-adornment. One epitaph records a man's provision for four annual observances in his honor: on the Parentalia, an official festival for honoring the dead February 13; his birthday (\"dies natalis\"); and a \"Rosaria\" and \"Violaria\". Guilds and associations \"(collegia)\" often provided funeral benefits for members, and some were formed specifically for that purpose. Benefactors might fund communal meals and rose-days at which members of the college honored the dead. The College of Aesculapius and Hygia at Rome celebrated a Violet Day on March 22 and a Rose Day May 11, and these flower festivals are frequent among the occasions observed by dining clubs and burial societies.\n\nMost evidence for the Rosalia comes from Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), where twenty-four Latin inscriptions referring to it have been found. Ten Latin inscriptions come from the Italian peninsula, three from Macedonia, and four from Thrace, Illyria, and Pannonia. Six Greek inscriptions come from Bithynia, three from Macedonia, and one each from Bulgaria, Scythia, Mysia, Phrygia, Lydia, Asia and Arcadia.\nAt Pergamon, Rosalia seems to have been a three-day festival May 24–26, beginning with an \"Augustan day\" (\"dies Augusti\", a day of Imperial cult marking a birthday, marriage, or other anniversary of the emperor or his family). The three-day Rosalia was among the occasions observed by a group of hymnodes, a male choir organized for celebrating Imperial cult, as recorded in a Greek inscription on an early 2nd-century altar. The \"eukosmos\", the officer of \"good order\" who presided over the group for a year, was to provide one \"mina\" (a monetary unit) and one loaf for celebrating the Rosalia on the Augustan day, which was the first day of the month called Panemos on the local calendar. On the second of Panemos, the group's priest provided wine, a table setting, one \"mina\", and three loaves for the Rosalia. The \"grammateus\", a secretary or administrator, was responsible for a \"mina\", a table setting worth one denarius, and one loaf for the third day of Rosalia. The group seems to have functioned like a \"collegium\" at Rome, and as a burial society for members.\n\nInscriptions from Acmonia, in Phrygia, show the Rosalia in the context of the religious pluralism of the Roman Empire. In 95 AD, a bequest was made for a burial society to ensure the annual commemoration of an individual named Titus Praxias. In addition to a graveside communal meal and cash gifts to members, 12 denarii were to be allocated for adorning the tomb with roses. The obligations of membership were both legally and religiously binding: the society had its own tutelary deities who were invoked to oversee and ensure the carrying out of the deceased's wishes. These were \"Theos Sebastos\" (= \"Divus Augustus\" in Latin), Zeus under the local and unique epithet \"Stodmenos\", Asclepius the Savior (Roman Aesculapius, as in the \"collegium\" above), and Artemis of Ephesus. Acmonia also had a significant Greek-speaking Jewish community, and an inscription dating from the period 215–295 records similar arrangements made for a Jewish woman by her husband. It provides for an annual rose-adornment of the tomb by a legally constituted neighborhood or community association, with the solemn injunction \"and if they do not deck it with roses each year, they will have to reckon with the justice of God.\" The formula \"he will have to reckon with God\" was used only among Jews and Christians in Phrygia, and there is a slighter possibility that the inscription might be Christian. The inscription is among the evidence that Judaism was not isolated from the general religious environment of the Imperial world, since a \"rosatio\" could be made without accompanying sacrifices at the tomb. Instead of multiple deities, the Jewish husband honoring his wife invoked the divine justice of his own God, and chose to participate in the customs of the community while adapting them in ways \"acceptable to his Jewish faith\".\nIn Imperial-era Macedonia, several inscriptions mention the Rosalia as a commemorative festival funded by bequests to groups such as a \"vicianus\", a village or neighborhood association (from \"vicus\"); \"thiasos\", a legally constituted association, often having a religious character; or \"symposium\", in this sense a drinking and social club. In Thessalonica, a priestess of a \"thiasos\" bequeathed a tract of grapevines to pay for rose wreaths. If the Dionysian \"thiasos\" disbanded or failed in its duties, the property was to pass to a society of \"Dryophoroi\" (\"Oak-Bearers\"), or finally to the state. In addition to associations of initiates into the mysteries of Dionysus, inscriptions in Macedonia and Thrace record bequests for rose-adornment to \"thiasoi\" of Diana (Artemis) and of the little-attested Thracian god or hero Sourogethes, and to a gravediggers' guild. The gravediggers were to kindle a tombside fire each year for the Rosalia, and other contexts suggest that the wreaths themselves might be burnt as offerings. A distinctive collocation that occurs a few times in Macedonian commemoration is an inscription prescribing the Rosalia accompanied by a relief of the Thracian Horseman.\n\nSome scholars think that customs of the Rosalia were assimilated into Bacchic festivals of the dead by the Roman military, particularly in Macedonia and Thrace. A Greek inscription of 138 AD records a donation for rose-adornment \"(rhodismos)\" to the council in Histria, in modern Dobruja, an area settled by the Thracian Bessi, who were especially devoted to Dionysus. Macedonia was famed for its roses, but nearly all evidence for the Rosalia as such dates to the Roman period.\n\nAlthough ivy and grapevines are the regular vegetative attributes of Dionysus, at Athens roses and violets could be adornments for Dionysian feasts. In a fragment from a dithyramb praising Dionysus, the poet Pindar (5th century BC) sets a floral scene generated by the opening up of the Seasons \"(Horae)\", a time when Semele, the mortal mother of Dionysus, is to be honored:\n\n\"... as the chamber of the purple-robed Horai is opened,<br>the nectar-bearing flowers bring in the sweet-smelling spring.<br>Then, then, upon the immortal earth are cast<br>the lovely tresses of violets, and roses fitted to hair<br>and voices of songs echo to the accompaniment of pipes<br>and choruses come to Semele of the circling headband.\"\nDionysus was an equalizing figure of the democratic \"polis\" whose band of initiates \"(thiasos)\" provided a model for civic organizations. A form of Dionysia dating to pre-democratic Athens was the Anthesteria, a festival name some scholars derive from Greek \"anthos\", \"flower, blossom\", as did the Greeks themselves, connecting it to the blossoming grapevine. In the 6th century AD, the Byzantine antiquarian Joannes Lydus related the festival name to \"Anthousa\", which he said was the Greek equivalent of the Latin \"Flora\". The three-day festival, which took place at the threshold between winter and spring, involved themes of liminality and \"opening up\", but despite its importance in early Athens, many aspects elude certainty. It was primarily a celebration of opening the new wine from the previous fall's vintage. On the first day, \"Dionysus\" entered borne by a wheeled \"ship\" in a public procession, and was taken to the private chamber of the king's wife for a ritual union with her; the precise ceremonies are unknown, but may be related to the myth of Ariadne, who became the consort of Dionysus after she was abandoned by the Athenian culture hero Theseus.\nIn keeping with its theme of new growth and transformation, the Anthesteria was also the occasion for a rite of passage from infancy to childhood—a celebratory moment given the high rate of infant mortality in the ancient world. Children between the age of three and four received a small jug \"(chous)\" specially decorated with scenes of children playing at adult activities. The \"chous\" itself is sometimes depicted on the vessel, adorned with a wreath. The following year, the child was given a ceremonial taste of wine from his \"chous\". These vessels are often found in children's graves, accompanying them to the underworld after a premature death.\n\nThe Anthesteria has also been compared with the Roman Lemuria, with the second day a vulnerable time when the barrier between the world of the living and the dead became permeable, and the shades of the dead could wander the earth. On the third day, the ghosts were driven from the city, and Hermes Chthonios (\"Underworld Hermes\") received sacrifices in the form of pots of grains and seeds. Although the identity of the shades is unclear, typically the restless dead are those who died prematurely.\n\nThe priestess of Thessalonica who bequeathed a tract of vineyard for the maintenance of her memory required each Dionysian initiate who attended to wear a rose wreath. In a Dionysian context, wine, roses, and the color red are trappings of violence and funerals as well as amorous pursuits and revelry. Dionysus is described by Philostratus (d. ca. 250 AD) as wearing a wreath of roses and a red or purple cloak as he encounters Ariadne, whose sleep is a kind of death from which she is awakened and transformed by the god's love.\nThe crown that symbolized Ariadne's immortal union with Dionysus underwent metamorphosis into a constellation, the Corona Borealis; in some sources, the \"corona\" was a diadem of jewels, but for the Roman dramatist Seneca and others it was a garland of roses. In the \"Astronomica\" of Manilius (1st century AD), Ariadne's crown is bejeweled with purple and red flowers—violets, hyacinths, poppies, and \"the flower of the blooming rose, made red by blood\"—and exerts a positive astrological influence on cultivating flower gardens, weaving garlands, and distilling perfume.\n\nDionysian scenes were common on Roman sarcophagi, and the persistence of love in the face of death may be embodied by attendant Cupids or Erotes. In Vergil's \"Aeneid\", purple flowers are strewn with the pouring of Bacchic libations during the funeral rites the hero Aeneas conducts for his dead father. In the \"Dionysiaca\" of Nonnus (late 4th–early 5th century AD), Dionysus mourns the death of the beautiful youth Ampelos by covering the body with flowers—roses, lilies, anemones—and infusing it with ambrosia. The dead boy's metamorphosis creates the first grapevine, which in turn produces the transformative substance of wine for human use.\n\nThe rites of Adonis \"(Adoneia)\" also came to be regarded as a Rosalia in the Imperial era. In one version of the myth, blood from Aphrodite's foot, pricked by a thorn, dyes the flowers produced from the body of Adonis when he is killed by the boar. In the \"Lament for Adonis\" attributed to Bion (2nd century BC), the tears of Aphrodite match the blood shed by Adonis drop by drop,\n\"and the blood and tears become flowers upon the ground. Of the blood comes the rose, and of the tears the windflower.\"\n\nAccording to myth, Adonis was born from the incestuous union of Myrrha and her father. The delusional lust was a punishment from Aphrodite, whom Myrrha had slighted. The girl deceived her father with darkness and a disguise, but when he learned who she really was, his rage transformed her human identity and she became the fragrance-producing myrrh tree. The vegetative nature of Adonis is expressed in his birth from the tree. In one tradition, Aphrodite took the infant, hid him in a box \"(larnax\", a word often referring to chests for ash or other human remains), and gave him to the underworld goddess Persephone to nurture. When he grew into a beautiful youth, both Aphrodite and Persephone—representing the realms of love and death—claimed him. Zeus decreed that Adonis would spend a third of the year with the heavenly Aphrodite, a third with chthonic Persephone, and a third on the mortal plane. The theme is similar to Persephone's own year divided between her underworld husband and the world above.\n\nFor J.G. Frazer, Adonis was an archetypal vegetative god, and H.J. Rose saw in the rites of Adonis \"the outlines of an Oriental myth of the Great Mother and of her lover who dies as the vegetation dies, but comes back to life again.\" Robert A. Segal analyzed the death of Adonis as the failure of the \"eternal child\" \"(puer)\" to complete his rite of passage into the adult life of the city-state, and thus as a cautionary tale involving the social violations of \"incest, murder, license, possessiveness, celibacy, and childlessness\".\nWomen performed the \"Adoneia\" with ceremonial lamentation and dirges, sometimes in the presence of an effigy of the dead youth that might be placed on a couch, perfumed, and adorned with greenery. As part of the festival, they planted \"gardens of Adonis\", container-grown annuals from \"seeds planted in shallow soil, which sprang up quickly and withered quickly\", compressing the cycle of life and death. The festival, often nocturnal, was not a part of the official state calendar of holidays, and as a private rite seems like the Rosalia to have had no fixed date. Although the celebration varied from place to place, it generally had two phases: joyful revelry like a marriage feast in celebration of the love between Aphrodite and Adonis, and ritual mourning for his death. Decorations and ritual trappings for the feast, including the dish gardens, were transformed for the funeral or destroyed as offerings: the garlanded couch became the lying-in bier \"(prothesis)\".\n\nThe iconography of Aphrodite and Adonis as a couple is often hard to distinguish in Greek art from that of Dionysus and Ariadne. In contrast to Greek depictions of the couple enjoying the luxury and delight of love, Roman paintings and sarcophagi almost always frame their love at the moment of loss, with the death of Adonis in Aphrodite's arms posing the question of resurrection. At Madaba, an Imperial city of the Province of Arabia in present-day Jordan, a series of mythological mosaics has a scene of Aphrodite and Adonis enthroned, attended by six Erotes and three Charites (\"Graces\"). A basket of overturned roses near them has been seen as referring to the Rosalia.\n\nIn late antiquity, literary works set at a Rosalia—whether intended for performance at the actual occasion, or only using the occasion as a fictional setting—take the \"lament for Adonis\" as their theme. Shared language for the Roman festival of Rosalia and the floral aspects of the \"Adoneia\" may indicate similar or comparable practices, and not necessarily direct assimilation.\n\nFrom the reign of Claudius to that of Antoninus Pius, a \"holy week\" in March developed for ceremonies of the Magna Mater (\"Great Mother\", also known as \"Mater Deum\", \"Mother of the Gods,\" or Cybele) and Attis. A preliminary festival on March 15 marked the discovery by shepherds or Cybele of the infant Attis among the reeds of a Phrygian river. The continuous ceremonies recommenced March 22 with the \"Arbor intrat\" (\"The Tree enters\") and lasted through March 27 or 28. For the day of \"Arbor intrat,\" the college of dendrophores (\"tree-bearers\") carried a pine tree to which was bound an effigy of Attis, wrapped in \"woollen bandages like a corpse\" and ornamented with violet wreaths. Lucretius (1st century BC) mentions roses and other unnamed flowers in the ecstatic procession of the Magna Mater for the Megalensia in April.\n\nThe most vivid and complex account of how the violet was created out of violence in the Attis myth is given by the Christian apologist Arnobius (d. ca. 330), whose version best reflects cult practice in the Roman Imperial period. The story begins with a rock in Phrygia named \"Agdus\", from which had come the stones transformed to humans by Pyrrha and Deucalion to repopulate the world after the Flood. The Great Mother of the Gods customarily rested there, and there she was assailed by the lustful Jupiter. Unable to achieve his aim, the king of gods relieved himself by masturbating on the rock, from which was born Acdestis or Agdistis, a violent and supremely powerful hermaphroditic deity. After deliberations, the gods assign the \"cura\" of this audacity to Liber, the Roman god identified with Dionysus: \"cura\" means variously \"care, concern, cure, oversight.\"\n\nLiber sets a snare, replacing the waters of Agdistis's favorite spring \"(fons)\" with pure wine. Necessity in time drives the thirsty Agdistis to drink, veins sucking up the torpor-inducing liquid. The trap is sprung: a noose, woven from hair, suspends Agdistis by the genitals, and the struggle to break free causes a self-castration. From the blood springs a pomegranate tree, its fruit so enticing that Nana, the daughter of the river god Sangarius, \"in sinu reponit\", a euphemism in Imperial-era medical and Christian writing for \"placed within the vagina\". Nana becomes pregnant, enraging her father. He locks her away as damaged goods, and starves her. She is kept alive by fruits and other vegetarian food provided by the Mother of the Gods. When the infant is born, Sangarius orders that it be exposed, but it is discovered and reared by a goatherd. This child is Attis.\nThe exceptionally beautiful Attis grows up favored by the Mother of the Gods and by Agdistis, who is his constant companion. Under the influence of wine, Attis reveals that his accomplishments as a hunter are owing to divine favor—an explanation for why wine is religiously prohibited \"(nefas)\" in his sanctuary and considered a pollution for those who would enter. Attis's relationship with Agdistis is characterized as \"infamis\", disreputable and socially marginalizing. The Phrygian king Midas, wishing to redeem the boy \"(puer)\", arranges a marriage with his daughter, and locks down the city. The \"Mater Deum\", however, know Attis's fate \"(fatum)\": that he will be preserved from harm only if he avoids the bonds of marriage. Both the Mother of the Gods and Agdistis crash the party, and Agdistis spreads frenzy and madness among the convivial guests. In a detail that appears only in a vexed passage in the Christian source, the daughter of a concubine to a man named Gallus cuts off her breasts. Raging like a bacchant, Attis then throws himself under a pine tree, and cuts off his genitals as an offering to Agdistis. He bleeds to death, and from the flux of blood is born a violet flower.\n\nThe Mother of the Gods wraps the genitals \"in the garment of the dead\" and covers them with earth, an aspect of the myth attested in ritual by inscriptions regarding the sacrificial treatment of animal scrota. The would-be bride, whose name is Violet (Greek \"Ia)\", covers Attis's chest with woollen bands, and after mourning with Agdistis kills herself. Her dying blood is changed into purple violets. The tears of the Mother of the Gods become an almond tree, which signifies the bitterness of death. She then takes the pine tree to her sacred cave, and Agdistis joins her in mourning, begging Jupiter to restore Attis to life. This he cannot permit; but fate allows the body to never decay, the hair to keep growing, and the little finger to live and to wave in perpetual motion.\n\nArnobius explicitly states that the rituals performed in honor of Attis in his day reenact aspects of the myth as he has told it, much of which developed only in the Imperial period, in particular the conflict and intersections with Dionysian cult. For the \"Arbor intrat\" on March 22, the dendrophores carried the violet-wreathed tree of Attis to the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a \"dies violae\", the day of \"Arbor intrat\" recalled the scattering of violets onto graves for the Parentalia. The next day the dendrophores laid the tree to rest with noisy music that represented the Corybantes, youths who performed armed dances and in mythology served as guardians for infant gods. For the \"Dies Sanguinis\" (\"Day of Blood\") on March 24, the devotees lacerated themselves in a frenzy of mourning, spattering the effigy with the blood craved as \"nourishment\" by the dead. Some followers may have castrated themselves on this day, as a preliminary to becoming \"galli\", the eunuch priests of Cybele. Attis was placed in his \"tomb\" for the Sacred Night that followed.\n\nAccording to Sallustius, the cutting of the tree was accompanied by fasting, \"as though we were cutting off the further progress of generation; after this we are fed on milk as though being reborn; that is followed by rejoicings and garlands and as it were a new ascent to the gods.\" The garlands and rejoicing \"(Hilaria)\" occurred on March 25, the vernal equinox on the Julian calendar, when Attis was in some sense \"reborn\" or renewed. Some early Christian sources associate this day with the resurrection of Jesus, and Damascius saw it as a \"liberation from Hades\". After a day of rest \"(Requietio),\" the ritual cleansing \"(Lavatio)\" of the Magna Mater was carried out on March 27. March 28 may have been a day of initiation into the mysteries of the Magna Mater and Attis at the Vaticanum.\n\nAlthough scholars have become less inclined to view Attis within the rigid schema of \"dying and rising vegetation god\", the vegetal cycle remains integral to the funerary nature of his rites. The pine tree and pine cones were introduced to the iconography of Attis for their cult significance during the Roman period. A late 1st- or 2nd-century statue of Attis from Athens has him with a basket containing pomegranates, pine cones, and a nosegay of violets.\n\nPerceived connections with older spring festivals that involved roses helped spread and popularize the Rosalia, and the private \"dies violae\" or \"violaris\" of the Romans was enhanced by the public prominence of \"Arbor intrat\" ceremonies. The conceptual link between Attis and Adonis was developed primarily in the later Imperial period. The Neoplatonic philosopher Porphyry (d. ca. 305 AD) saw both Adonis and Attis as aspects of the \"fruits of the earth\":\n\n\"Attis is the symbol of the blossoms which appear early in the spring, and fall off before the complete fertilization; whence they further attributed castration to him, from the fruits not having attained to seminal perfection: but Adonis was the symbol of the cutting of the perfect fruits.\"\n\nPorphyry linked Attis, Adonis, Korē (Persephone as \"the Maiden\", influencing \"dry\" or grain crops), and Dionysus (who influences soft and shell fruits) as deities of \"seminal law\":\"For Korē was carried off by Pluto, that is, the sun going down beneath the earth at seed-time; but Dionysus begins to sprout according to the conditions of the power which, while young, is hidden beneath the earth, yet produces fine fruits, and is an ally of the power in the blossom symbolized by Attis, and of the cutting of the ripened corn symbolized by Adonis.\"\n\nRoses and violets are typically among the flower species that populate the meadow from which Persephone was abducted as Pluto's bride. The comparative mythologist Mircea Eliade saw divine metamorphosis as a \"flowing of life\" between vegetal and human existence. When violent death interrupts the creative potential of life, it is expressed \"in some other form: plant, fruit, flower\". Eliade related the violets of Attis and the roses and anemones of Adonis to legends of flowers appearing on battlefields after the deaths of heroes.\n\nThe Roman army celebrated the \"Rosaliae signorum,\" when the military standards \"(signa)\" were adorned with roses in a supplication, on two dates in May. A.H. Hooey viewed the military rose festival as incorporating traditional spring festivals of vegetative deities. The festival is noted in the \"Feriale Duranum\", a papyrus calendar for a cohort stationed at Dura-Europos during the reign of Severus Alexander (224–235 AD). The calendar is thought to represent a standard religious calendar issued to the military. The day of the earlier of the two \"Rosaliae\" is uncertain because of the fragmentary text, but coincided with the period of the Lemuria, archaic festival days on May 9, 11, and 13 for propitiating shades \"(lemures\" or \"larvae)\" of those whose untimely death left them wandering the earth instead of passing into the underworld. The ceremonies of the Lemuria, in the vivid description of Ovid, featured the spitting of black beans as an especially potent apotropaic gesture. The second of the \"Rosaliae signorum\" occurred on May 31, the day before the Kalends of June. The feast day of June 1, devoted to the tenebrous \"Dea Carna\" (\"Flesh Goddess\" or \"Food Goddess\") and commonly called the \"Bean Kalends\" \"(Kalendae Fabariae)\", may have pertained to rites of the dead and like the days of the Lemuria was marked on the calendar as \"nefastus\", a time when normal activities were religiously prohibited. In the later Empire, the \"Rosaliae signorum\" coincided with the third day of the \"Bean Games\" \"(Ludi Fabarici)\" held May 29–June 1, presumably in honor of Carna. A civilian inscription records a bequest for rose-adornment \"on the Carnaria\", interpreted by Mommsen as Carna's Kalends.\n\nSculpture from a 3rd-century military headquarters at Coria, in Roman Britain (Corbridge, Northumberland), has been interpreted as representing the \"Rosaliae\". A 3rd-century inscription from Mogontiacum (present-day Mainz), in the province of Germania Superior, records the dedication of an altar to the Genius of the military unit (a \"centuria\"), on May 10. Although the inscription does not name the \"Rosaliae\", the date of the dedication, made in connection with Imperial cult, may have been chosen to coincide with it.\nThe \"Rosaliae signorum\" were part of devotional practices characteristic of the army surrounding the military standards. The Imperial historian Tacitus says that the army venerated the standards as if they were gods, and inscriptions record dedications \"(vota)\" made on their behalf. The day on which a legion marked the anniversary of its formation was the \"natalis aquilae\", \"the Eagle's birthday,\" in reference to the Roman eagle of the standard. All Roman military camps, including marching camps, were constructed around a central altar where daily sacrifices were made, surrounded by the standards planted firmly into the ground and by images of emperors and gods. Decorated units displayed gold and silver wreaths on their standards that represented the bestowal of living wreaths, and the Eagles and other \"signa\" were garlanded and anointed for lustrations, ceremonies for beginning a campaign, victories, crisis rituals, and Imperial holidays. Among these occasions was the wedding of the emperor Honorius in 398 AD, described in an epithalamium by Claudian: the military standards are said to grow red with flowers, and the standard-bearers and soldiers ritually shower the imperial bridegroom with flowers \"purpureoque ... nimbo\", in a purple halo. In recounting a mutiny against Claudius in 42 AD, Suetonius avers that divine agency prevented the Eagles from being adorned or pulled from the earth to break camp by the legionaries who had violated their oath \"(sacramentum)\"; reminded of their religious obligation, they were turned toward repentance \"(in paenitentiam religione conversis)\". Christian apologists saw the veneration of the \"signa\" as central to the religious life of the Roman military, and Minucius Felix tried to demonstrate that because of the cruciform shape, the soldiers had been worshipping the Christian cross without being aware of it.\n\nMost evidence of the Rosalia from the Empire of the 1st–3rd centuries points toward festivals of the dead. Soldiers commemorated fallen comrades, and might swear an oath on the \"manes\" (deified spirits) of dead brothers-in-arms. Hooey, however, argued against interpreting the \"Rosaliae signorum\" as a kind of \"poppy day\". Roman rose festivals, in his view, were of two distinct and mutually exclusive kinds: the celebratory and licentious festivals of spring, and the somber cult of the dead. Transferred from the civilian realm, the old festivals of vegetative deities were celebrated in the Eastern Empire in a spirit of indulgence and luxury that was uniquely out of keeping with the public and Imperial character of other holidays on the \"Feriale Duranum\". This \"carnival\" view of the \"Rosaliae signorum\" was rejected by William Seston, who saw the May festivals as celebratory lustrations after the first battles of the military campaigning season, coordinate with the Tubilustrium that fell on May 23 between the two rose-adornments.\nThe Tubilustrium was itself a purification ritual. Attested on calendars for both March 23 and May 23, it was perhaps originally monthly. The lustration \"(lustrum)\" was performed regarding the annunciatory trumpets (\"tubi\" or \"tubae\", a long straight trumpet, and \"cornua\", which curved around the body) that were used to punctuate sacral games and ceremonies, funerals, and for signals and timekeeping in the military. The March 23 Tubilustrium coincided in the city of Rome with a procession of Mars' armed priests the Salii, who clanged their sacred shields. In the later Empire, it had become assimilated into the \"holy week\" of Attis, occurring on the day when the tree rested at the Temple of the Magna Mater. As a pivotal point in the cycle of death/chaos and (re)birth/order, the day brought together noise rituals of wind and percussion instruments from different traditions, the clamor of the Corybantes or \"Kouretes\" who attended Cybele and Attis, and Roman ceremonies of apotropaic trumpet blasts or the beating of shields by the Salian priests, who were theologically identified with the \"Kouretes\" as early as the 1st century BC.\n\nTacitus records the performance of noise rituals on the trumpets by the military in conjunction with a lunar eclipse. The practice is found in other sources in a civilian context. Jörg Rüpke conjectures that the \"tubae\" were played monthly \"to fortify the waning moon (Luna)\", one nundinal cycle after the full moon of the Ides, since the Roman calendar was originally lunar. The \"signa\" and the trumpets were closely related in Roman military culture, both ceremonially and functionally, and on Trajan's Column the trumpets are shown pointing toward the standards during lustrations. Although Latin \"lustratio\" is usually translated as \"purification\", lustral ceremonies should perhaps be regarded as realignments and restorations of good order: \"lustration is another word for maintaining, creating or restoring boundary lines between the centric order and the ex-centric disorder\". The \"Rosaliae\" of the standards in May were contingent on \"supplicationes\", a broad category of propitiatory ritual that realigned the community, in this case the army, with the \"pax deorum\", the \"treaty\" or peace of the gods, by means of a procession, public prayers, and offerings. The military calendar represented by the \"Feriale Duranum\" prescribed \"supplicationes\" also for March 19–23, the period that began with the Quinquatria, an ancient festival of Minerva and Mars, and concluded with a Tubilustrium. The Crisis of the Third Century prompted a revival and expansion of the archaic practice of \"supplicatio\" in connection with military and Imperial cult.\n\nIn the later Empire, rose festivals became part of the iconography for the month of May. The date would vary locally to accommodate the blooming season. For month allegories in mosaics, May is often represented with floral wreaths, the fillets or ribbons worn for sacrifice, and wine amphorae. May (Latin \"Maius\") began in the middle of the \"Ludi Florae\", a series of games in honor of the goddess Flora that opened April 28 of the Julian calendar and concluded May 3. Flora was a goddess of flowers and blooming, and her festivities were enjoyed with a notable degree of sexual liberty. In the 2nd century AD, Philostratus connects rose garlands with Flora's festival. A Greek epigram from the \"Palatine Anthology\" has May personified announce \"I am the mother of roses\".\n\nAmong explanations for the month's name was that it derived from \"Maia\", a goddess of growth or increase whose own name was sometimes said to come from the adjective \"maius\", \"greater\". Maia was honored in May with her son Mercury (Greek Hermes), a god of boundaries and commerce, and a conductor of souls to the afterlife. The theological identity of Maia was capacious; she was variously identified with goddesses such as \"Terra Mater\" (\"Mother Earth\"), the Good Goddess \"(Bona Dea)\", the Great Mother Goddess \"(Magna Mater\", a title also for Cybele), Ops (\"Abundance, Resources\"), and Carna, the goddess of the Bean Kalends on June 1. Roses were distributed to the Arval Brothers, an archaic priesthood of Rome, after their banquets for the May festival of Dea Dia.\nAlthough the month opened with the revelry of Flora, in mid-May the Romans observed the three-day Lemuria for propitiating the wandering dead. The season of roses thus coincided with traditional Roman festivals pertaining to blooming and dying. The demand for flowers and perfumes for festal and funerary purposes made floriculture an important economic activity, especially for the rich estates of Roman Africa. One Roman tomb painting shows vendors displaying floral garlands for sale. Following the Lemuria, Mercury and Maia received a joint sacrifice during a merchants' festival on the Ides of May (the 15th). The Calendar of Filocalus (354 AD) notes a flower fair on May 23, when the roses come to market \"(macellus)\". The month is illustrated for this calendar with a king of roses: a young man, wearing the long-sleeved robe called a \"dalmatica\", carries a basket of roses on his left arm while holding a single flower in his right hand to smell. In other pictorial calendars, the Rose King or related imagery of the rose festival often substitutes for or replaces the traditional emblem of Mercury and his rites to represent May.\n\nIn Ovid's \"Fasti\", a poem about the Roman calendar, Flora as the divine representative of May speaks of her role in generating flowers from the blood of the dead: \"through me glory springs from their wound\". Ovid shows how her mythology weaves together themes of \"violence, sexuality, pleasure, marriage, and agriculture.\" The Romans considered May an unpropitious month for weddings, a postponement that contributed to the popularity of June as a bridal month. Each day of the Lemuria in mid-May was a \"dies religiosus\", when it was religiously prohibited to begin any new undertaking, specifically including marriage \"for the sake of begetting children\".\n\nIn the 4th century, the Rosalia was marked on the official calendar as a public holiday at the amphitheater with games \"(ludi)\" and theatrical performances. A calendar from Capua dating to 387 AD notes a \"Rosaria\" at the amphitheater on May 13.\n\nIn the 6th century, a \"Day of Roses\" was held at Gaza, in the Eastern Roman Empire, as a spring festival that may have been a Christianized continuation of the Rosalia. John of Gaza wrote two anacreontic poems that he says he presented publicly on \"the day of the roses\", and declamations by the Christian rhetorician Procopius and poetry by Choricius of Gaza are also set at rose-days.\n\nRoses were in general part of the imagery of Early Christian funerary art, as was ivy. Martyrs were often depicted or described with flower imagery, or in ways that identified them with flowers. Paulinus of Nola (d. 431) reinterpreted traditions associated with the Rosalia in Christian terms for his natal poem \"(natalicium)\" about Saint Felix of Nola, set January 14:\n\n\"Sprinkle the ground with flowers, adorn the doorways with garlands. Let winter breathe forth the purple beauty \"(purpureum)\" of spring; let the year be in flower before its time, and let nature submit to the holy day. For you also, earth, owe wreaths to the martyr’s tomb. But the holy glory of the doorway to the heavens encircles him, flowering with the twin wreaths of war and peace.\"\nAt one of the earliest extant martyr shrines, now part of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan, a mosaic portrait dating perhaps as early as 397–402 depicts Saint Victor within a classically inspired wreath of lilies and roses, wheat stalks, grapes on the vine, and olive branches: the circular shape represents eternity, and the vegetation the four seasons. In the Christian imagination, the blood-death-flower pattern is often transferred from the young men of Classical myth—primarily Adonis and Attis—to female virgin martyrs. Eulalia of Mérida is described by Prudentius (d. ca. 413) as a \"tender flower\" whose death makes her \"a flower in the Church's garland of martyrs\": the flow of her purple blood produces purple violets and blood-red crocuses \"(purpureas violas sanguineosque crocos)\", which will adorn her relics. The rose can also symbolize the blood shed with the loss of virginity in the sacrament of marriage.\n\nDrawing on the custom of floral crowns as awards in the Classical world, Cyprian (d. 258) described heavenly crowns of flowers for the faithful in the afterlife: lilies for those who did good works, and an additional crown of roses for martyrs. In one early passion narrative, a martyr wears a rose crown \"(corona rosea)\" at a heavenly banquet. For Ambrose (d. 397), lilies were for virgins, violets for confessors of the faith, and roses for martyrs; of these, the imagery of the violet has no biblical precedent. In a passage influenced by Vergilian imagery, Ambrose enjoins young women who are virgins to \"Let the rose of modesty and the lily of the spirit flourish in your gardens, and let banks of violets drink from the spring that is watered by the sacred blood.\" In the description of Jerome (d. 420), \"a crown of roses and violets\" is woven from the blood of Saint Paula's martyrdom. Dante later entwines Classical and Christian strands of imagery in his \"Paradiso\", linking the garland of saints with the rose \"corona\" of Ariadne, whom he imagines as translated to the heavens by it. The use of the term \"rosary\" (Latin \"rosarium\", a crown or garland of roses) for Marian prayer beads was objected to by some Christians, including Alanus de Rupe, because it evoked the \"profane\" rose wreath of the Romans.\nMiracles involving roses are ascribed to some female saints, while roses are a distinguishing attribute of others ranging from Cecilia of Rome (d. 230 AD) to Thérèse of Lisieux (d. 1897). The floral iconography of Saint Cecilia includes a rose or floral wreath, a palm branch, and a \"tall sprig of almond leaves and flowers in her hand\". Roses are among the most characteristic attributes of Mary, mother of Jesus, who became associated with the month of May, replacing goddesses such as Maia and Flora in the popular imagination. Mary is described in early Christian literature as a \"rosa pudoris\", \"rose of modesty\", and a rose among thorns. In the Middle Ages, roses, lilies and violets become the special flowers of Mary. In some Catholic cultures, offerings of flowers are still made to Mary, notably in Mexican devotional practices for Our Lady of Guadalupe. On the island of Pollap, in Micronesia, offerings of flowers before the cult statue of Mary are added to ceremonies of the rosary especially for May; the concept of the rosary as a \"crown of roses\" complements local traditions of wearing a flower wreath on the head. Latin hymns and litanies from the earliest Christian era name Mary as the \"Mystical Rose\" and by an array of rose epithets, or as a garden that bore Christ in the image of the rose. Ambrose declared that the blood of Christ in the Eucharist, transubstantiated from wine, was to be perceived as a rose. The five-petaled rose became a symbol of the Five Wounds of Christ and hence of the Resurrection.\n\nThe living bodies and corpses of saints were said to exude a floral \"odor of sanctity\" as one of the most notable signs of their holiness. Pope Gregory I described the fragrance and luminosity of the rose as issuing from the blood of martyrs. Herman of Steinfeld exhaled a fragrance \"like a garden full of roses, lilies, violets, poppies and all kinds of fragrant flowers\" as he prayed. The bedridden virgin Lydwine of Schiedam was said to consume nothing but spiced wine, and wept \"fragrant tears of blood\" which she called her roses; when these dried on her cheeks overnight, they were gathered and kept in a box. The omen of her death was the opening of roses on a mystical rosebush, and when she was buried the bag of rose blood-tears was used as her pillow. Flowers, blood, and relics were interwoven in the imagery of Christian literature from the earliest period.\n\nTwo days of the liturgical calendar have been called \"Rose Sundays\". The fourth Sunday of Lent is also known as \"Dominica de rosa\" (\"Rose Sunday\"), when rose-colored vestments may replace the purple or violet penitential vestments of the season. On this day the Pope blesses the Golden Rose, a jewel in the shape of a rose. Benedict, a canon of St. Peter's Basilica in the mid-12th century, recorded a ceremony on this day when the Pope carried a moss-wrapped rose in the Stations of the Cross. A 19th-century ecclesiastical lexicographer saw the Golden Rose as having functions analogous to the Golden Bough, with Mary assuming attributes of Persephone.\n\nIn medieval texts, Pentecost is sometimes called \"Rosalia\" or \"Rosata Pascha\". The traditional Romanian name for Pentecost is \"Rusalii\", thought to derive from \"Rosalia\". In medieval Rome, a \"Dominica de Rosis\" (Sunday of Roses) or \"Pascha rosarum\" or \"rosatum\" was celebrated for the octave of the Feast of the Ascension, the Sunday before Pentecost. The Pope delivered a sermon about the Holy Spirit on this day at the Santa Maria Rotunda, the basilica converted from the ancient Pantheon. Rose petals were showered through the oculus in the dome to represent the descent of the tongues of flame. After dinner, a \"ludus Carnelevaris\" was celebrated with drinking among the knights and soldiers, followed by performances which featured the killing of animals that symbolized various sins. The custom of scattering roses for Pentecost spread, and continued to the modern era, as reflected in feast names such as the \"Pasqua di rose\" or \"Pâques rosées\". Churches might be built with a \"\" in the ceiling for the release of rose petals or white doves. Some sources from the 19th and early-20th centuries saw Rose Sundays as a Christianized form of Rosalia.\n\n\n \n"}

The daily commitments allow participants to know about potential challenges as well as to coordinate efforts to resolve difficult and/or time-consuming issues. The stand-up has particular value in Agile software development processes, such as Scrum or Kanban, but can be utilized in context of any software-development methodology.\n\nThe meetings are usually timeboxed to between 5 and 15 minutes, and take place with participants standing up to remind people to keep the meeting short and to-the-point. The stand-up meeting is sometimes also referred to as the \"stand-up\", \"morning rollcall\" or \"daily scrum\".\n\nThe meeting should take place at the same time and place every working day. All team members are encouraged to attend, but the meetings are not postponed if some of the team members are not present. One of the crucial features is that the meeting is a communication opportunity among team members and not a status update to management or stakeholders. Although it is sometimes referred to as a type of status meeting, the structure of the meeting is meant to promote follow-up conversation, as well as to identify issues before they become too problematic. The practice also promotes closer working relationships in its frequency, need for follow-up conversations and short structure, which in turn result in a higher rate of knowledge transfer – a much more active intention than the typical status meeting. Team members take turns speaking, sometimes passing along a token to indicate the current person allowed to speak. Each member talks about progress since the last stand-up, the anticipated work until the next stand-up and any impediments, taking the opportunity to ask for help or collaborate.\n\nTeam members may sometimes ask for short clarifications and make brief statements, such as \"Let's talk about this more after the meeting\", but the stand-up does not usually consist of full-fledged discussions.\n\nScrum-style stand-ups convene daily to re-plan in-progress development. Though it may not be practical to limit all discussion to these three questions, the objective is to create a new sprint plan within the time box (less than 15 minutes), while deferring discussions about impediments until after the event is complete.

The series used Group C category sports prototypes identical to the ones used in the World Sportscar Championship, yet running nearly exclusively within West Germany. The series lasted for four years before it was cancelled following the 1989 championship.\n\nThe series was initially sponsored by sport auto magazine during its inaugural season, then replaced by Würth the following two years. Television network Sat.1 sponsor the championship's final year.\n\nThe Supercup would employ a sprint format for all of its races, each race lasting approximately one hour although later events were extended to near an hour and a half. These short distances meant that unlike the endurance races seen in the World Championship, Supercup teams would not be required to change drivers during the course of an event. Each season consisted of five rounds, all held in West Germany with the exception of a Silverstone round in 1989. Popular circuits included the Nürburgring, Hockenheimring, Diepholz airfield, and the Norisring 200 Miles event.\n\nThe cars ran rules nearly identical to the FIA's Group C category, broken into C1 and C2 classes. The larger C1 class was dominated by both factory and customer Porsche 956s and 962Cs, as well as efforts from the Jaguar, Mercedes-Benz, and Nissan factory teams. C2 consisted of teams running engines limited in capacity to produce less power than the C1 cars but also weighed less. Although two classes ran, only a single championship was held.\n\nChampionships for both drivers and teams were held over the four seasons. Joest Racing won three championships, with the factory Porsche team winning during their sole year of competition. Hans-Joachim Stuck won the drivers championship the first two years for Joest then Porsche.

Bob Wollek returned the drivers championship to the team in 1989, to go along with their third team title.\n\nThe championship was cancelled following the 1989 season as manufacturers and teams chose to concentrate solely on the World Championship rather than risking equipment and drivers for a national series. Porsche withdrew immediately after their 1987 championship, while Sauber left the series after failing to win the teams championship in 1988. Although fields of twenty cars were still seen in the final year, there was a lack of interest in a 1990 season, the series was folded.\n\n"}

Although the event takes place in Gabon, the initial objective of this event is to present the traditional cultural richness of the different ethnic groups of the peoples of Central Africa.\n\nThe origin of the creation of the tournament of the nine provinces dates back to 2015. This independent initiative was born thanks to Yoan Mboussou, Doctor and president of the socio-cultural association Espoir Gabon, who had this idea after discovering the \"abandoned remains\" of the Bantu International Center of Civilizations (CICIBA), a project that never really came into being when it was supposed to promote Bantu culture around the world. There was also, according to the members of the association Gabon, a desire to revive the festival of cultures Gabon which had disappeared in recent years.\n\nThe first edition of this festival took place in August 2016 in Libreville, one week before the Gabonese presidential election of 2016 which was going to plunge the country into a deep political crisis. There was a desire to strengthen social cohesion, which was beginning to show signs of tension in the face of the presidential scrutiny approach.\n\nThe 2016 tournament of the nine provinces took place during the week of 13 to 20 August 2016, in Libreville, Gabon. Open to the public, its realization within the ruins of the CICIBA was done with the cooperation of the squatters association of CICIBA. The final of this first edition saw the participation of two countries: Gabon and Chad. The President of the jury was none other than the singer of the traditional group Tandima, Vyckos Ekondo. The socio-cultural group Mouvissa won the first prize, amounting to 1 000 000 FCFA. The final groups for this edition were the Akeng Alliance, Bane Batsiane, Cultural Hope, Milimba, Mivengui, Mouvissa, Mutoka culture, Ogheya and Lip Darna groups from Chad (excluding competition).\n\nThe 2017 edition took place from 7 to 16 August 2017 at the Botanical Garden of Libreville.\n"}

In contrast to consumer fairs, only some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade, e.g. professionals) and members of the press, therefore trade shows are classified as either \"public\" or \"trade only\". A few fairs are hybrids of the two; one example is the Frankfurt Book Fair, which is trade only for its first three days and open to the general public on its final two days. They are held on a continuing basis in virtually all markets and normally attract companies from around the globe. For example, in the U.S., there are currently over 10,000 trade shows held every year, and several online directories have been established to help organizers, attendees, and marketers identify appropriate events.\n\nModern trade fairs follow in the tradition of trade fairs established in late medieval Europe, in the era of merchant capitalism. In this era, produce and craft producers visited towns for trading fairs, to sell and showcase products. From the late eighteenth century, industrial exhibitions in Europe and North America became more common reflecting the technological dynamism of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the concept of annual industry-wide trade shows gained traction, spreading from European manufacturing centers to North America. By the 20th century, specialized companies came into existence simply to manage the trade-show industry, and permanent trade show grounds or convention centers were established as venues that featured a rotating calendar of trade shows.\n\nIn the 21st century, with the rapid industrialization of Asia, trade shows and exhibitions are now commonplace throughout the Asian continent, with China dominating the exhibitions industry in Asia, accounting for more than 55 per cent of all space sold in the region in 2011.\n\nTrade fairs play important roles in marketing as well as business networking in market sectors that use them. People will seek to meet people and companies at their own level in the supply chain, as well as potential suppliers and potential buyers.\n\nGenerally there will be a central trade show floor with booths where people exhibit their goods or services, and throughout the day there will be seminars for continuing education on matters relevant to the industry, like best practices, trends, and regulation. There will also be some shared meals with keynote speakers, and social events in the evenings. Booths range from simple tables to elaborate constructions.\n\nTrade fairs often involve a considerable investment in time and money by participating companies. The planning includes arranging meetings with other attendees beforehand and resources to follow up on opportunities that are created at the fair. Costs include space rental, booth design and construction of trade show displays, telecommunications, travel, accommodations, and promotional literature and items to give to attendees. \n\nIn addition, costs are incurred at the show for services such as electrical, booth cleaning, internet services, and drayage (also known as material handling). This local spending on logistics leads cities to promote trade shows as a means of local economic development, as well as providing opportunities for local businesses to grow, and attract new businesses to come.\n\n"}
{"id": "631437", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=631437", "title": "Unto These Hills", "text": "Unto These Hills\n\nUnto These Hills is an outdoor historical drama during summers at the 2,800-seat Mountainside Theatre in Cherokee in western North Carolina. It is the third-oldest outdoor historical drama in the United States, after \"The Lost Colony\" in Manteo in eastern North Carolina, and \"The Ramona Pageant\" in Southern California. The first version of the play was written by Kermit Hunter and opened on July 1, 1950, to wide acclaim.\n\nThe play recounts the history of the Cherokee of the Eastern region up to their removal by United States forces in 1838 via the Trail of Tears to Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. The drama includes notable Cherokee historic figures, including Sequoyah, Junaluska, Chief Yonaguska or Drowning Bear, and William Holland Thomas (the adopted son of Drowning Bear and the only white chief of the Cherokee), Selu the Corn Mother, and Kanati the Great Hunter.\n\nThe Western North Carolina Associated Communities (WNCAC) in western North Carolina wanted to develop tourism and promote economic growth in the western part of the state. Inspired by the success of Paul Green's historic outdoor drama, or political pageant, The Lost Colony, the WNCAC decided to make another political pageant about the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (ECBI) in Cherokee North Carolina. When Paul Green was unavailable to write a second play, they commissioned UNC grad student Kermit Hunter to write the new outdoor drama. With the help of Joe Jennings, director Samuel Selden chose the breathtaking backdrop for the drama in the EBC's homeland of Cherokee, North Carolina. The Mountainside Theatre theater was then built for this outdoor drama. The play was first produced on July 1, 1950. It was immediately successful with more than 100,000 audience members in its first year of production. \n\nThe play has run for more than 60 years at the Mountainside Theatre, which is owned and operated by the EBCI. It is staged Monday through Saturday evenings. \n\nFamous alumni of \"Unto These Hills\" include Michael Rosenbaum, best known for his portrayal of Lex Luthor on \"Smallville\"; Adam Richman, host of Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food\"; Polly Holliday, of the 1970s sitcom \"Alice\"; and actor and former U.S. Representative Ben L. Jones of Georgia, a regular on CBS's \"The Dukes of Hazzard\".\n\nIn 2006, the EBCI Tribal Government hired playwright Hanay Geiogamah (Kiowa) to revise the script, the first complete rewrite since the play was instituted. Geiogamah is a writer/director/producer of Native American dramas, as well as the founder of the American Indian Dance Theatre and Professor in the Department of Theater at the University of California, Los Angeles. Geiogamah was chosen to address a number of issues with the previous script, including historical inaccuracies. He was also encouraged to increase Cherokee tribal participation in the cast. Geiogamah accepted this challenge, wrote a new script, and produced a show. But, many tribal members were reportedly not fond of the new play version, saying that it removed the Cherokee style of story telling and their history in this area. Geiogamah had added more interpretive dance to help convey the story. In addition, many tribal members missed having the story of Tsali included in the play. He is believed to have sacrificed his life in battle to gain approval for the remainder of his Cherokee people to stay in their homeland of North Carolina, at a time of conflict with European Americans.\n\nIn 2007, the tribe hired Pat Allee and Ben Hurst to write a new script. In 2008, additional changes were made by Linda West. Fewer than 50,000 people saw the performance in summer 2009, about half the number from years ago. John Tissue, director of the Cherokee Historical Association, suggests economic problems as the reason for the reduced crowds. The 2010 production is credited to Linda Squirrel. Eddie Swimmer, a Cherokee, serves as director of the drama. As of 2010, more than six million people have seen the production.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30967888", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30967888", "title": "While Europe Slept", "text": "While Europe Slept\n\nWhile Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West from Within is a 2006 book by Bruce Bawer. It was Bawer's second book dealing with the issue of religious fundamentalism, following his earlier \"Stealing Jesus: How Fundamentalism Betrays Christianity\", a critique of fundamentalist Christianity published in 1998.\n\n\"While Europe Slept\" argues that Europe's democratic traditions and open society face a growing demographic and cultural threat from Europe's Muslim immigrant communities, who according to Bawer reject Enlightenment values and resist integration. Bawer blames this trend primarily on an alleged \"self-destructive passivity\" among Europeans, whom he regards as \"appeasing\" essentially incompatible philosophies like radical Islam in the name of religious tolerance. Bawer compares this approach unfavorably with what he sees as a more robust American tradition which proudly asserts its values and expects immigrants to adopt them.\n\nThe book received mixed reviews, with some strongly supporting its arguments while others rejected or even ridiculed them. Some felt the book raised important questions but failed to adequately make its case.\n\nThe book received a 2006 nomination in the \"Criticism\" category from the National Book Critics Circle, a choice which was met with condemnation from two former members of the organization.\n\n\"While Europe Slept\" advances two central arguments: firstly, that Europe faces a growing cultural and demographic threat from its Muslim immigrant population; and secondly, that Europe's political and intellectual leadership is exacerbating the threat by failing to encourage immigrants to fully integrate into the wider society. Bawer's argument is summarized by one of the book's reviewers thus:\n\nEuropean governments subscribe to the worst kind of political correctness, Bawer writes. From Norway to Italy, governments shower immigrants with benefits, yet corral them into ghettos, prevent them from becoming real citizens and turn a blind eye to Muslim attacks on women, Jews and gays, he says.\n\nBawer hints at a coming cataclysm. \"Immigrants to Europe bring with them many tribal customs that are flagrantly inconsistent with a Western understanding of human rights\", he writes. \"These customs represent flashpoints of latent or potential conflict between the Muslim immigrant communities and their host societies.\" \nBawer blames the problem not only on Muslims, but on what he implies is a latent bigotry amongst Europeans, which leads them to marginalize and isolate immigrant communities in the name of multiculturalism. He compares this approach unfavorably with what he sees as the American \"melting pot\" tradition, in which immigrants are expected to adopt American values and fully integrate into the wider society.\n\nDue to what he asserts is a rapidly growing Muslim demographic, Bawer foresees \"a long twilight of Balkanization with Europe divided into warring pockets of Muslims and non-Muslims.\" Bawer warns that without a change of direction, Europe may eventually face a stark choice between \"cultural surrender or full-fledged civil war.\"\n\nBawer also believes that anti-Americanism has led Europe to reject America's hard line on Islamic extremism and tolerate dangerous pockets of radical Islam in its midst:\n\n\"In the end, Europe's enemy is not Islam, or even radical Islam. Europe's enemy is itself—its self-destructive passivity, its softness toward tyranny, its reflexive inclination to appease, and its uncomprehending distaste for America's pride, courage, and resolve in the face of a deadly foe.\"\n\nAccording to \"Public Eye\" magazine, reviews of \"While Europe Slept\" were \"easily sorted along ideological grounds\", with conservatives generally praising the book while liberals repudiated it. Some critics suggested that the book raised important or timely questions, but criticized its methodology and/or conclusions.\n\nIn an article published in \"The Wall Street Journal\", Walter Laqueur writes that \"\"While Europe Slept\" is an angry book, well written and well informed. And it could not, of course, be more timely.\" J. Peder Zane of the National Book Critics Circle wrote that the book offers \"urgent prose that challenges widely held ideas\" in addition to \"provocative—and controversial—arguments\". A review in \"American Thinker\" described the book as simply a \"stunner\" with \"horrific\" implications for the future of Europe.\n\nZane thinks the book \"begs innumerable qualifications\" when it bluntly states that \"European Muslims are hostile to 'pluralism, tolerance, democracy and sexual equality'\", but believes that Bawer addresses those qualifications. Zane suggests that Bawer, who is openly gay, is concerned about what could happen to European gay communities if Islamists succeed in establishing Sharia law that is hostile to homosexuals.\n\nAlthough Zane believes that drawing conclusions based upon \"anecdotes\" \"is always dicey\", he concedes that \"Bawer catalogs many incidents in which officials excuse Muslim rapists because their Western victims 'dressed provocatively,' attribute gay-bashing incidents to general anger at 'oppression' and anti-Semitic violence to Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.\"\n\nSome reviewers strongly criticized the book. Denis Staunton wrote in \"The Irish Times\" that \"Bawer will do anything to discover the dark side of Muslims in Europe, whom he accuses of everything from swindling the welfare system to supporting terrorists.\" Simon Kuper, in the \"Financial Times\", described the book's central \"Eurabia\" thesis as \"ludicrous\".\n\nAccording to Kuper, Bawer's book, like others of its kind, \"start with disclaimers that not all Muslims support terrorist jihad. This is then swiftly forgotten as the plans for jihad in Europe are outlined.\" Kuper rejects the claim that Muslims are any kind of demographic threat, asserting that Muslims comprise \"less than 4 percent\" of the EU population, and that their allegedly high birth rates are rapidly falling into line with that of other Europeans. Like a number of other reviewers, Kuper complains that Bawer's book is poorly documented: \"Any source will do: Bawer cites [Bat] Ye'or, an Amsterdam taxi driver, a woman in a Swedish bar, or often no source at all.\" He concludes that the \"target market\" for such books \"seems to be the US ... because hardly anybody who actually lives in Europe could take these dystopias seriously.\"\n\nA review in \"The Economist\" suggests that Bawer's homosexuality \"may have sensitized him to the clash brewing between immigrant communities, who by and large reject European attitudes toward women and sexuality, and native Europeans for whom such cultural liberalism has become a core value.\" Noting that Bawer \"understands the importance\" of distinguishing between moderate Muslims and radicals, \"The Economist\" continues:\n\n\"In practice, though, he seems incapable of maintaining the distinction for long. On one page, he approvingly quotes a Muslim liberal who says, “There's a big difference between a Muslim and an Islamist, just as big a difference as between a German and a Nazi.” A few pages later, he uses wildly exaggerated statistics to give warning that Muslim birth rates will soon turn Europe into “Eurabia”. The Muslim share of Switzerland's population is not an “astonishing 20%”, as Mr Bawer claims, but 4.3%, at least according to the 2000 Swiss census.\"\n\nSteven Simon in \"The Washington Post\" argues that \"the book usefully crystallizes, without undue distortion, the apprehensions of many Europeans about what has become a dire cultural predicament\", but notes: \"With not a single endnote and virtually no data other than the author's personal experiences and conversations, \"While Europe Slept\" is not going to ring scholarly chimes, and the spirits of Spengler and Churchill evoked by its overwrought title will alienate many specialists\".\n\nWriting in \"The Boston Globe\", Eric Weinberger offered more nuanced criticism. He finds the first part of the book \"credible\", arguing that Bawer's \"claims are sometimes eccentric, but his critique of the EU and its elites is bracing and commonsensical\". The second part, Weinberger characterizes as \"alarmist in the way of good pamphlets: The argument is worth having, but any kind of prediction seems too pat. I say \"pamphlet\" because it is not truly a reporting project ... much of the book's facts, statistics, and quotations clearly come off the Internet.\" Weinberger also notes the book's lack of sourcing, observing that \"There are no footnotes, no bibliography and few citations – strange for a critic trained as a scholar, and a pity, for startling facts require careful verification\".\n\n\"While Europe Slept\" was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award in the 2006 \"Criticism\" category, a choice condemned in some quarters. The board's president, John Freeman, wrote that he had \"never been more embarrassed by a choice than I have been with Bruce Bawer’s \"While Europe Slept\"\", adding that in his opinion, Bawer's \"hyperventilated rhetoric tips from actual critique into Islamophobia\". A former winner of the Award, Eliot Weinberger, labelled the book \"racism as criticism\".\n\nA member of the Critics Circle committee, J. Peder Zane, defended the nomination, stating that it \"wasn't a contentious selection\". Zane criticized comments made by Weinberger, saying \"He not only was completely unfair to Bruce Bawer, he’s also saying that those of us who put the book on the finalist list are racist or too stupid to know we’re racist.\"\n\nBawer himself characterized the criticism as symptomatic of one of the very problems he had sought to address in the book:\n\n\"One of the most disgraceful developments of our time is that many Western authors and intellectuals who pride themselves on being liberals have effectively aligned themselves with an outrageously illiberal movement that rejects equal rights for women, that believes gays and Jews should be executed, that supports the coldblooded murder of one’s own children in the name of honor, etc., etc.\"\n\nBawer's book ultimately lost in its category to Lawrence Weschler's \"Everything That Rises\".\n"}
{"id": "338154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=338154", "title": "Wound", "text": "Wound\n\nA wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \"open\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \"closed\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin.\n\nAccording to level of contamination, a wound can be classified as:\n\nOpen wounds can be classified according to the object that caused the wound:\n\nClosed wounds have fewer categories, but are just as dangerous as open wounds:\n\nBacterial infection of wound can impede the healing process and lead to life-threatening complications. Scientists at Sheffield University have used light to rapidly detect the presence of bacteria, by developing a portable kit in which specially designed molecules emit a light signal when bound to bacteria. Current laboratory-based detection of bacteria can take hours or days.\n\nWounds that are not healing should be investigated to find the causes; many microbiological agents may be responsible. The basic workup includes evaluating the wound, its extent and severity. Cultures are usually obtained both from the wound site and blood. X-rays are obtained and a tetanus shot may be administered if there is any doubt about prior vaccination.\n\nNon-healing wounds of the diabetic foot are considered one of the most significant complications of diabetes, representing a major worldwide medical, social, and economic burden that greatly affects patient quality of life. Almost 24 million Americans—one in every twelve—are diabetic and the disease is causing widespread disability and death at an epidemic pace, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those with diabetes, 6.5 million are estimated to suffer with chronic or non-healing wounds. Associated with inadequate circulation, poorly functioning veins, and immobility, non-healing wounds occur most frequently in the elderly and in people with diabetes—populations that are sharply rising as the nation ages and chronic diseases increase.\n\nAlthough diabetes can ravage the body in many ways, non-healing ulcers on the feet and lower legs are common outward manifestations of the disease. Also, diabetics often suffer from nerve damage in their feet and legs, allowing small wounds or irritations to develop without awareness. Given the abnormalities of the microvasculature and other side effects of diabetes, these wounds take a long time to heal and require a specialized treatment approach for proper healing.\n\nAs many as 25% of diabetic patients will eventually develop foot ulcers, and recurrence within five years is 70%. If not aggressively treated, these wounds can lead to amputations. It is estimated that every 30 seconds a lower limb is amputated somewhere in the world because of a diabetic wound. Amputation often triggers a downward spiral of declining quality of life, frequently leading to disability and death. In fact, only about one third of diabetic amputees will live more than five years, a survival rate equivalent to that of many cancers.\n\nMany of these lower extremity amputations can be prevented through an interdisciplinary approach to treatment involving a variety of advanced therapies and techniques, such as debridement, hyperbaric oxygen treatment therapy, dressing selection, special shoes, and patient education. When wounds persist, a specialized approach is required for healing.\n\nTo heal a wound, the body undertakes a series of actions collectively known as the wound healing process.\n\nA wound may be recorded for follow-up and observing progress of healing with different techniques which include:\n\nThe overall treatment depends on the type, cause, and depth of the wound, and whether other structures beyond the skin (dermis) are involved. Treatment of recent lacerations involves examining, cleaning, and closing the wound. Minor wounds, like bruises, will heal on their own, with skin discoloration usually disappearing in 1–2 weeks. Abrasions, which are wounds with intact skin (non-penetration through dermis to subcutaneous fat), usually require no active treatment except keeping the area clean, initially with soap and water. Puncture wounds may be prone to infection depending on the depth of penetration. The entry of puncture wound is left open to allow for bacteria or debris to be removed from inside.\n\nEvidence to support the cleaning of wounds before closure is scant. For simple lacerations, cleaning can be accomplished using a number of different solutions, including tap water and sterile saline solution. Infection rates may be lower with the use of tap water in regions where water quality is high. Cleaning of a wound is also known as 'wound toilet'.\n\nIf a person presents to a healthcare center within 6 hours of a laceration they are typically closed immediately after evaluating and cleaning the wound. After this point in time, however, there is a theoretical concern of increased risks of infection if closed immediately. Thus some healthcare providers may delay closure while others may be willing to immediately close up to 24 hours after the injury. Using clean non-sterile gloves is equivalent to using sterile gloves during wound closure.\n\nIf closure of a wound is decided upon a number of techniques can be used. These include bandages, a cyanoacrylate glue, staples, and sutures. Absorbable sutures have the benefit over non absorbable sutures of not requiring removal. They are often preferred in children. Buffering the pH of lidocaine makes the injection less painful.\nAdhesive glue and sutures have comparable cosmetic outcomes for minor lacerations <5 cm in adults and children. The use of adhesive glue involves considerably less time for the doctor and less pain for the person. The wound opens at a slightly higher rate but there is less redness. The risk for infections (1.1%) is the same for both. Adhesive glue should not be used in areas of high tension or repetitive movements, such as joints or the posterior trunk.\n\nIn the case of clean surgical wounds, there is no evidence that the use of topical antibiotics reduces infection rates in comparison with non-antibiotic ointment or no ointment at all. Antibiotic ointments can irritate the skin, slow healing, and greatly increase the risk of developing contact dermatitis and antibiotic resistance. Because of this, they should only be used when a person shows signs of infection and not as a preventative.\n\nThe effectiveness of dressings and creams containing silver to prevent infection or improve healing is not currently supported by evidence. \n\nThere is moderate evidence that honey is more effective than antiseptic followed by gauze for healing wounds infected after surgical operations. There is a lack of quality evidence relating to the use of honey on other types of wounds, such as minor acute wounds, mixed acute and chronic wounds, pressure ulcers, Fournier's gangrene, venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and Leishmaniasis.\n\nThere is no good evidence that therapeutic touch is useful in healing. More than 400 species of plants are identified as potentially useful for wound healing. Only three randomized controlled trials, however, have been done for the treatment of burns.\n\nFrom the Classical Period to the Medieval Period, the body and the soul were believed to be intimately connected, based on several theories put forth by the philosopher Plato. Wounds on the body were believed to correlate with wounds to the soul and vice versa; wounds were seen as an outward sign of an inward illness. Thus, a man who was wounded physically in a serious way was said to be hindered not only physically but spiritually as well. If the soul was wounded, that wound may also eventually become physically manifest, revealing the true state of the soul. Wounds were also seen as writing on the \"tablet\" of the body. Wounds acquired in war, for example, told the story of a soldier in a form which all could see and understand, and the wounds of a martyr told the story of their faith.\n\nIn humans and mice it has been shown that estrogen might affect the speed and quality of wound healing.\n\n"}
