The race marked the nineteenth race of the 1994 NASCAR Winston Cup Series season. It was the first NASCAR stock car race at the famous Speedway, and the first race of any kind held at the track besides the Indianapolis 500 since the Harvest Classic in 1916. The race featured the largest crowd in NASCAR history, and a then NASCAR record purse of $3.2 million.\n\nSecond-year driver, 23-year-old Jeff Gordon from nearby Pittsboro, was cheered on by the hometown crowd to a popular win. It was his second career NASCAR Winston Cup win, and thrust the young Gordon into superstardom on the racing circuit.\n\nThe race was a culmination of over two years of preparation, and decades of speculation. While the event was looked on with enormous anticipation and significant media attention, the traditional nature of the Indianapolis 500 and the Speedway was a concern to ownership, some from the Indy car community, and some fans. Despite some mild complaints, the event was considered a huge success and a financial cash cow—it ultimately bankrolled the formation of the Indy Racing League. The race featured two former Indy 500 winners (A. J. Foyt and Danny Sullivan). Foyt came out of retirement to participate, which would be his final Winston Cup start.\n\nThe Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909, and the first Indianapolis 500 was held in 1911. It became a tradition that the Indianapolis 500 was the only race held at the track annually. With the exception of a Labor Day race meet in 1916, no other races were held at the track through 1993. As the NASCAR Winston Cup Series began to grow in stature and popularity, speculation began to grow in the 1980s and early 1990s about the possibility of holding a race at Indy.\n\nOn September 24, 1991, A. J. Foyt filmed a commercial for Craftsman tools at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. While filming in the garage area, Foyt, and Speedway president Tony George decided to take Foyt's NASCAR Winston Cup Series stock car for a few laps around the track. Foyt was the first driver to do so, and later on, George himself took a few laps. The event was not planned, and had no implications, but was an unusual sight, and stirred up some mild interest and speculation for the future.\n\nIn December 1991, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway board of directors voted to pursue a second race at the Speedway, preferably a NASCAR Winston Cup event. In March 1992, IROC was invited to test cars at the Speedway. On June 22–23, 1992, nine top NASCAR Winston Cup series teams were invited to test at Indy. Although no official announcements were made, it was in fact an unofficial compatibility test to see if stock cars would be competitive at the circuit. An estimated 10,000 spectators watched two days of history in the making.\n\nOn April 14, 1993, Speedway President Tony George and president of NASCAR Bill France, Jr. jointly announced the Inaugural Brickyard 400 would be held Saturday, August 6, 1994. A new race logo was also unveiled. Immediately, anticipation for the event grew, as many drivers contemplated one-off entries, and comparisons were already being made to NASCAR's biggest event, the Daytona 500. ABC signed on to broadcast the race live, and ESPN would cover practice and qualifying.\n\nJimmy Spencer won the DieHard 500 at Talladega, immediately proceeding the 1994 Brickyard 400. Going into the race, the top five in championship points were as follows:\n\nNASCAR's \"tire war\" was notable during the 1994 season. Both Goodyear and Hoosier tires were used by entrants. Many of the front-runners utilized Goodyear. Among the top teams using Hoosier tires was Geoff Bodine.\n\nIn order to attract more entries, the initial Brickyard 400 was concurrently included in the NASCAR Winston West schedule. One provisional starting position would be available to the top driver in Winston West points that did not qualify on speed. The points leader in Winston West standings entering the race was Mike Chase.\n\nGoing into the race, conjecture amongst fans and media contemplated the possibility of an expanded field, a special qualifying format, a three-abreast starting grid, a celebrity pace car driver, or other changes for the race. However, NASCAR officials planned on treating the Brickyard 400 as any other points-paying race, with standard rules and regulations.\n\nOn June 22–23, 1992, nine top NASCAR Winston Cup series teams were invited to Indy to participate in a Goodyear tire test. Over the weekend, the teams had raced in the Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Michigan International Speedway. Although no official announcements were made, it was in fact an unofficial feasibility test to see if stock cars would be competitive at the circuit. An estimated 20,000-25,000 spectators watched a rather exciting two days of history in the making. A. J. Foyt took a few laps around the track in Dale Earnhardt's car on the second day. ESPN covered the test.\n\nOn August 16–17, 1993, thirty-five NASCAR teams took part in an official open test at Indy. It was held as the teams returned from the second race at Michigan, the Champion Spark Plug 400. The top 35 teams in NASCAR points received invitations. Hosting the test in August mimicked the weather conditions expected for the race in 1994. Several thousand spectators attended, and many announcements were made.\n\nBobby Labonte () set the fastest lap on Monday, while Bill Elliott () turned the fastest lap overall on Tuesday morning. On Monday, Kenny Wallace spun out and hit the inside wall. He was taken to Methodist Hospital for minor injuries. At noon on Tuesday, recently retired NASCAR legend Richard Petty took four fast laps by himself, and then donated his car to the Speedway museum. Later on Tuesday, during a session of \"drafting practice,\" a full complement of over 30 cars took to the track, to simulate race condition. John Andretti spun in turn 1, and several cars crashed. No injuries were reported, but the incident drew the ire of some of the veterans who thought some drivers were pushing too hard. ESPN covered the test, airing highlights of both days on SpeedWeek.\n\nSome of the participants compared the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to Ontario Motor Speedway, which was built to closely mimic Indy's layout. Only a handful of drivers in the field had actually driven at Ontario before it closed (1980), and none of them felt they held any sort of measurable experience advantage.\n\nDuring the summer of 1994, private testing sessions conducted by the manufacturers were held. Ford teams tested in late June, with Sterling Marlin leading the first week with a lap at . During the second week, Ernie Irvan turned the fastest unofficial lap at the Speedway at over . Rusty Wallace was close behind at . A. J. Foyt came out of retirement, shaking down and testing the #50 Ford.\n\nIn early July, Davy Jones turned a lap at , but would later wreck his primary car. Chevrolet and Pontiac teams took to the track in mid-July. Danny Sullivan blew an engine.\n\nPole qualifying for the Inaugural Brickyard 400 was held on Thursday, August 4, 1994. A NASCAR record 85 cars entered, for 43 starting positions. H. B. Bailey drew the #1 qualifying attempt. Per the NASCAR rules in 1994, a one-lap qualifying attempt was utilized. The top 20 cars in pole qualifying were locked into the starting field. The remainder of the cars could stand on their time, or make a new attempt in second-round qualifying.\n\nPractice was held Thursday morning. Three incidents occurred, a crash by Robert Pressley, a crash by Tim Steele, and Dale Jarrett brushed the wall. Pressley and Steele would switch to back-up cars, while Jarrett's car was not seriously damaged. The practice session was followed by a heavy thunderstorm that pelted the Speedway. The rain stopped and the track dried, allowing qualifying to start nearly on time at 3 p.m.\n\nThe entire qualifying line of 70 attempts was completed without a single incident. Only two drivers experienced trouble, one was Ken Schrader, who blew an engine during his attempt. Dale Earnhardt took the provisional pole with a lap of , but his tenure was short-lived. The very next car out to qualify was Rick Mast. Mast set a new stock car lap record of to secure the pole position. Jeff Gordon was one of the last cars to make an attempt, and qualified third.\n\nIndy car and IMSA regular Geoff Brabham, attempting his first NASCAR race, surprised many by qualifying 18th. Former Indy 500 winners A. J. Foyt and Danny Sullivan, however, did not make the top twenty. Wally Dallenbach, Jr., driving for Petty Enterprises, who picked 84th out of the 85 cars in line, pulled in when he felt something was wrong with the engine and ended the day with no speed.\n\nSecond-round qualifying was held Friday, August 5, 1994. The drivers who had failed to qualify by being inside the top 20 from the previous round were allowed to stand on their time from Thursday, or erase it and make a new attempt. Due to the expected length of the session, and the sensitive nature of how the track is known to react to changing weather conditions, for fairness, the qualifying draw order from the previous round was inverted for round two. NASCAR subsequently adopted this policy for all races from that day forth until two-round qualifying was abolished at the end of the 2000 season.\n\nFive drivers stood on their times from Thursday, and all five hung on to qualify for the race. Terry Labonte, who had placed 26th Thursday, was among those who elected to re-qualify, and he wound up the fastest qualifier of the day. The decision was wise as Labonte's Thursday speed would not have help up Friday. A. J. Foyt managed to qualify in 40th, the last car to make the field on speed. After a miserable run on Thursday, Kyle Petty found much-needed speed and placed 36th. Lake Speed (168.429 mph) and Harry Gant (168.003 mph) both failed to crack the top 40, but made the field as the provisional starters – the two highest placed entries in NASCAR points standing not already in the race. No Winston West Series competitors made the field on speed, but Mike Chase (166.312 mph) was awarded a special provisional for the highest entry in Winston West points standings (Chase was the Winston West points leader going into the race).\n\nVery few of the one-off entries by Indy car regulars made the field. Danny Sullivan surprised himself by placing 26th for his first (and only) career Winston Cup start. Popular Indy car owner Dick Simon who was noted for never failing to qualify one of his rookie drivers at the Indy 500 fell short as his driver, NASCAR veteran Jim Sauter, ranked only 47th. After no major incidents on Thursday, Friday's qualifying saw wrecks or spins by four cars, including Daytona 500 polesitter Loy Allen Jr..\n\nAmong the drivers who chose not to make an qualifying attempt in the second round session was Ben Hess, who had been injured in an accident during a practice session earlier in the day. H. B. Bailey, who had drawn the first spot in the qualifying order Thursday was, per the inverted order, the final car to make a qualifying attempt on Friday. Bailey closed out time trials, gaining over 8 mph from his previous speed, but still fell far short of making the starting lineup.\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Stood on Thursday time\n\nA trio of brothers - Geoff, Brett, and Todd Bodine made the field, a feat that had only been accomplished once in the history of the Indy 500. In 1982, Don, Bill, and Dale Whittington all qualified for the 500. Another trio of brothers nearly did the same as Rusty and Kenny Wallace qualified, but Mike Wallace ranked only 55th. P. J. Jones, son of 1963 Indianapolis 500 winner Parnelli Jones, and the only driver entered who was a son of a former Indy 500 winner, did not complete a qualifying attempt.\n\nPopular Indianapolis 500 fixture Jim Nabors was invited to sing the national anthem, accompanied by the Indiana State University Marching Sycamores. Mary F. Hulman gave the traditional starting command. Elmo Langley drove the Chevrolet Monte Carlo pace car, and Doyle Ford served as flagman. The flyover was performed by the 181st Fighter Group, featuring four F-16 fighter jets.\n\nAll living former NASCAR Winston Cup Champions were invited to participate in a pre-race parade around the track. Besides the former champions who qualified for the race (Earnhardt, Wallace, Elliott, Waltrip, and Labonte), those in attendance included Richard Petty, Rex White, Buck Baker, Ned Jarrett, and Benny Parsons. Former Daytona 500 winner Buddy Baker was also in attendance.\n\nAfter the final practice session Friday evening, polesitter Rick Mast, as well as Ernie Irvan and Brett Bodine, were among the teams that changed the engines in their cars.\n\nAt the start, polesitter Rick Mast led Dale Earnhardt into turn one. In turn four, Earnhardt brushed the wall, which allowed Mast to lead the first lap. Earnhardt quickly began to slip in the standings. Meanwhile, Jeff Gordon passed Mast to take over the lead. On lap 3, Danny Sullivan lost a side window, bringing out the caution for debris. Earnhardt pitted to check the damage, and fell to the rear of the field.\n\nThe green came back out on lap 6. On lap 10, Jimmy Spencer lost control and crashed hard in turn 3. He would become the first driver to drop out.\n\nThe first half settled into a comfortable pace, with Jeff Gordon leading for several segments. The top five was battled among drivers including Gordon, Geoff Bodine, Bill Elliott, Darrell Waltrip and Brett Bodine. Dale Earnhardt attempted to charge through the field, and managed to lead laps during a sequence of green flag pit stops.\n\nA. J. Foyt ran out of fuel around lap 40. He attempted to stay out and lead a lap during green flag pit stops, but had to coast around a full lap, and lost several laps in the process. He made it back to the pits, and re-joined the race.\n\nOn lap 95, Mike Chase and Dave Marcis crashed in turn 2, bringing out the caution. Under the yellow, Brett Bodine took on only two tires, which allowed him to re-enter the track with the lead. The field lined up for the restart with brothers Brett and Geoff Bodine first and second, respectively. Brett got the jump and led down the backstretch on lap 100. In turn three, Geoff nudged Brett's rear bumper, which caused Brett to become loose, and Geoff took the lead. In turn 4, however, Brett bumped Geoff in the rear bumper, and spun him out in front of the entire field. Geoff hit the outside wall, and collected Dale Jarrett. After the crash, Geoff suggested Brett spun him out on purpose, attributing the move to \"family problems\" between the brothers. Brett later admitted he spun Geoff out on purpose, and the brothers feuded for nearly two years afterward.\n\nWith Geoff Bodine out, the race came down to a battle between Jeff Gordon and Ernie Irvan, with Brett Bodine holding on to a strong top five position.\n\nOn lap 130, Geoff Brabham got high in turn 1 and hit the outside wall. Jimmy Hensley swerved to avoid him, but Brabham spun and smacked into the side of Hensley's car. Brabham was out of the race, but Hensley limped back to the pits with damaged fenders and flat tires. During the caution the leaders made their final scheduled pit stops. Rusty Wallace's pit crew led by Buddy Parrott, executed a 15.9 second pit stop, and he came out of the pits with the lead. Jeff Gordon and Ernie Irvan came out second and third. The top five was rounded out by Brett Bodine and Bill Elliott. By that point in the race, Dale Earnhardt had worked all the way up to seventh.\n\nThe green flag came back out on with 26 laps to. Rusty Wallace held the lead into turn 1, but Jeff Gordon passed him going down the backstretch. The two ran side-by-side in turn four, down the main stretch, and into turn 1. Gordon finally got by, Irvan now in second, and Wallace slipped all the way back to 7th.\n\nWith 20 laps to go, Ernie Irvan led Jeff Gordon and Brett Bodine. Gordon was battling a loose condition, and decided to tuck in behind Irvan to improve his handling. As the laps dwindled down, Irvan and Gordon raced nose-to-tail, and began to pull away from the rest of the field. Gordon slipped by to re-take the lead on lap 145. Irvan stayed within reach, and on lap 149, attempted to pass Gordon for the lead on the backstretch. Gordon stayed high in turn three, and the two went side-by-side into the turn. Exiting turn 4, Gordon held off the challenge. On lap 150, exiting turn two, Irvan tried the same move, and this time took the lead.\n\nWith ten laps to go, Gordon tucked into second, and allowed Irvan to lead. Gordon's crew was instructing him to wait until the final 2–3 laps to make a pass attempt for the lead.\n\nWith five laps to go, Irvan apparently ran over a piece of debris down the main stretch. He slid high going into turn one, and Jeff Gordon immediately dove underneath to take the lead. Down the backstretch, Irvan's right front tire blew, and he was forced to the pits. Gordon pulled away with Brett Bodine now in second. In the final four laps, Bodine began to close the gap, but Gordon held off the challenge and won the Inaugural Brickyard 400, his second career NASCAR Winston Cup victory. ABC Sports announcers Bob Jenkins and Benny Parsons described the finish thus:\nJenkins: Years from today when 79 \"(the number of Indianapolis 500s run prior to this event)\" stock car races have been run here, we'll remember the name: Jeff Gordon, winner of the inaugural Brickyard 400!<br>Parsons: Man, oh man, oh MAN!<br>Jenkins: Jeff is screaming on his radio back to the pit crew, \"Oh my God, I did it! I did it!\"\n\nAfter dropping to last place early on, Dale Earnhardt charged all the way to a fifth-place finish. A dejected Ernie Irvan wound up a lap down in 17th place. Two weeks later, Irvan was involved in a serious crash at Michigan International Speedway where he suffered a near-fatal head injury. Brett Bodine's second place with King Racing would be the final top five finish of his career. It was also the best finish for car owner Kenny Bernstein at the Speedway. Bodine's second place came six days after Scott Goodyear had delivered King Racing their first Indy car victory at Michigan.\n\n\n\n\nChampionship standings following the 1994 Brickyard 400\n\nThe 1994 Brickyard 400 was carried live on television by ABC Sports. Paul Page, who was the announcer on ABC's Indianapolis 500 broadcasts, served as host, with ABC/ESPN's regular NASCAR announcer Bob Jenkins handling the play-by-play duties. His fellow commentator on ESPN NASCAR broadcasts, Benny Parsons, served as color commentator. The pit reporters included Gary Gerould, Jerry Punch, and Jack Arute. ESPN carried practice and qualifying with the same crew. Ned Jarrett joined the booth crew for practice/qualifying only, but did not work in the television booth on race day (he had a contract at the time with CBS).\n\nThe race was carried live on the radio by the IMS Radio Network. The broadcast was carried by over 450 affiliates in the United States. Mike Joy served as the play-by-play, with Ned Jarrett as analyst. The turn reporters were Jerry Baker, Gary Lee, Larry Henry, and Bob Lamey. The pit reporters were Glenn Jarrett, Dave Despain, John Kernan and Chris McClure. Howdy Bell served as statistician. Chris Economaki sat in as a booth analyst during the pre-race, then as a roving reporter conducting interviews, and covering the garage area and hospital during the race. USAC historian Donald Davidson and author Greg Fielden were guests in the pre-race coverage, offering historical commentary. During the race itself, Davidson worked as a spotter for Bob Lamey on the radio. Davidson reprised his popular program \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\" on WIBC for the week leading up to the event. Buddy Baker served as the driver analyst during qualifying coverage on Thursday and Friday (as Jarrett had commitments with ESPN). On race day, Baker was not part of the crew but visited the booth for a brief interview. \n\nThe Speedway public address announcing team from the Indy 500 was retained for the Brickyard 400. The chief announcer Tom Carnegie was joined by Jim Phillippe and David Calabro, but John Totten did not participate.\n"}

The conference included the 10th Conference of the Parties (COP10) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nThe parties discussed the progress made since the first United Nations Climate Change Conference ten years ago and its future challenges, with special emphasis on climate change mitigation and adaptation. To promote developing countries better adapt to climate change, the Buenos Aires Plan of Action was adopted.

Although seven people faced charges related to the rape, one was released after a preliminary hearing. Five of the remaining six faced life imprisonment, should the charges be upheld, and one faced a maximum of eight years in jail. All initially pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe incident received national attention. As many as 20 witnesses are believed to have been aware of the attack, but for more than two hours no one notified the police.\n\nThe trials for the six defendants began September 2012, with defendant Manuel Ortega pleading guilty to four felonies and sentenced the following month to 32 years in prison. Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison. Jose Montano and Marceles Peter were convicted of forcible rape acting in concert, a forcible act of sexual penetration while acting in concert, and forcible oral copulation in concert.\n\nOn October 24, 2009 at about 9:30 p.m. (UTC-7), at the conclusion of the homecoming dance, a classmate invited the victim to join a group of males ranging in ages from 15 to late 40s, who were drinking alcohol in a dark courtyard on campus. The female victim drank an undetermined amount of brandy by choice, and was propositioned for sex by the alleged attackers. When the victim refused, she was placed on a nearby concrete bench and continuously beaten and raped for 2½ hours, at times with a 'foreign object'. They also poured alcohol down her throat. Test results showed she had an almost fatal blood alcohol level. A local resident heard of the attack from her boyfriend and immediately contacted the police. The victim was found unconscious under a picnic table and was air-lifted to a hospital in critical condition. She was released from the hospital on Wednesday, October 28.\n\nA bystander described the assault:\n\nThey were kicking her in her head and they were beating her up, robbing her and ripping her clothes off; it's something you can't get out your mind. I saw people, like, dehumanizing her; I saw some pretty crazy stuff. She was pretty quiet; I thought she was like dead for a minute but then I saw her moving around. I feel like I could have done something but I don't feel like I have any responsibility for anything that happened.\n\nWitnesses are believed to have recorded video footage of the attack using camera-equipped mobile phones, but local police have not been able to obtain the recordings. At least two dozen bystanders watched the assault without calling 911 to report it.\n\nSeven male suspects had been arrested in connection with the case. One of the initial suspects was subsequently released without charge due to lack of evidence. This initial suspect has since claimed that he was merely a witness present at the scene, and that his intent was to help the victim including offering her his shirt. However, he said that he did not contact authorities because he lacked a cell phone and was afraid of retaliation for \"snitching\". The remaining suspects range in age from 15 to 21. Police stated that their investigations are ongoing, and that they were looking for additional people in relation to the crime. A 43-year-old male was later arrested in relation to the events.\n\nFour of the suspects were arraigned on October 29 in the Contra Costa County Superior Court in Martinez. One chose to enter a plea of not guilty to the two charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force, while the others chose not to enter a plea at the time. Authorities have indicated that they expect all three juvenile defendants to be charged as adults. All six suspects entered not guilty pleas on Tuesday, December 1, 2009.\n\nThe attack shocked the community and the nation. Local media said that the act \"crossed the boundary of civilized behavior\".\n\nThe attack became the most popular blog topic of the week of October 26–30, as bloggers expressed their outrage over the rape. During that week, more than a quarter (26%) of the links from blogs to news sites were to articles about the attack. A website was created in order to support the victim and discuss ways to prevent sexual assault on women.\n\nAfter the attack, local toughs talked of vigilante justice against the attackers and onlookers.\n\nThe victim's parents made their first public statement on November 1:Please do not respond to this tragic event by promoting hatred or by causing more pain. We have had enough violence already in this place. If you need to express your outrage, please channel your anger into positive action. Volunteer at a school. Go help a neighbor. Be courageous in speaking the truth and in holding people accountable. Work toward changing the atmosphere in our schools and in this community so that this kind of thing never happens again.\n\nOver 500 students, parents, and area residents held a candle-lit vigil on November 3. At the vigil, the victim's church pastor read a statement from the victim, stating, \"We realize people are angry about this,\" but that \"violence is always the wrong choice.\" 200 people marched from Richmond High School to a nearby park and held a rally on November 7 to show support for the victim.\n\nIn response to the events, California State Senator Leland Yee suggested legislation to broaden the criteria when failure to report a crime constitutes a criminal offense. Under Yee's proposal, bystanders to crimes against minors could be charged with a misdemeanor criminal offense for failure to immediately report the incident to the police.\n\nThe 18-year-old woman who was the only person to call 911 and make police aware of the assault in progress, was honored by the Richmond City Council on November 17.\n\nSecurity around the school was increased following the attack: high-definition surveillance cameras were installed, along with increased lighting and new fencing.\n\nOn November 15, 2010, a preliminary hearing began in Contra Costa County, during which twenty witnesses appeared before the court. Of the seven defendants, six faced charges that could lead to life imprisonment, while the seventh faced a maximum term of 26 years in jail. All of the defendants pleaded not guilty to the crime. Evidence presented during the hearing connected four of the suspects to DNA found at the scene, although there was no DNA evidence connecting the remaining three defendants to the crime.\n\nAs a result of the hearing, one of the defendants was released. Of the remaining six, two had their charges reduced, with five facing life imprisonment and one facing an eight-year sentence.\n\nJury selection for trials of the defendants began September 4, 2012.\n\nManuel Ortega, who was an adult at the time of the crime and the most heavily charged of the six defendants, pleaded guilty to all charges against him on September 6 and was sentenced on October 19, accepting a 32-year sentence and avoiding possible life in prison. He was convicted of rape in concert, rape by a foreign object in concert, forced oral copulation in concert resulting in great bodily injury, and robbery. Ortega was described by authorities as an initiator in the rape, with witnesses alleging he ripped off the girl's clothes, punched and kicked her in the head, sexually assaulted her and encouraged others to do the same.\n\nOn January 11, 2013, Ari Morales was sentenced to 27 years in prison.\n\nIn June 2013, in the trials of Jose Montano, 22 and Marcelles Peter, 20, the victim testified in court for the first time. She stated she had never consumed alcohol previously, and that she did not drink from a bottle of brandy the men had with them. Salvardor Rodriguez, previously sentenced, testified \"Before she even said hello, she grabbed a bottle (of brandy) and started chugging it.\" The prosecutor said in his opening statement that head trauma and her 0.35 blood alcohol level interfered with her memory of the events, saying, \"They were pouring booze in her and on her, and that's after she was drinking it on her own.\" Charges were dismissed against the then-15-year-old classmate who invited her to the courtyard. Two more men were scheduled to be tried in August 2013.\n\nIn January 2011 the victim received a monetary settlement from the school district of $4 million. She received an immediate payout of $2.5 million, with the remaining $1.5 million to be paid over the next 40 years.\n\n"}
{"id": "22040167", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22040167", "title": "AIG bonus payments controversy", "text": "AIG bonus payments controversy\n\nThe AIG bonus payments controversy began in March 2009, when it was publicly disclosed that the American International Group (AIG) insurance corporation was going to pay approximately $218 million in bonus payments to employees of its financial services division.\n\nAIG is notable for having received taxpayer bailouts and in the fourth quarter of 2008 posted a loss of $61.7 billion, the greatest ever for any corporation. Beyond the $165 million in bonus payments that were announced, total bonuses for the financial unit could reach $450 million and bonuses for the entire company could reach $1.2 billion.\n\nPresident Barack Obama said, \"[I]t’s hard to understand how derivative traders at AIG warranted any bonuses, much less $165 million in extra pay. How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat?\" and \"In the last six months, AIG has received substantial sums from the U.S. Treasury. I’ve asked Secretary Geithner to use that leverage and pursue every legal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers whole.\"\n\nPoliticians on both sides of Congress reacted with outrage to the planned bonus payments. Senator Chuck Grassley (Republican, Iowa) said \"I would suggest the first thing that would make me feel a little bit better toward them if they'd follow the Japanese example and come before the American people and take that deep bow and say, I'm sorry, and then either do one of two things: resign or go commit suicide.\" Senator Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) accused AIG of \"Alice in Wonderland business practices\" and said \"It boggles the mind.\" He has threatened to tax the bonuses at up to 100%. Senator Richard Shelby (Republican, Alabama) said \"These people brought this on themselves. Now you're rewarding failure. A lot of these people should be fired, not awarded bonuses. This is horrible. It's outrageous.\" Senator Mitch McConnell (Republican, Kentucky) echoed his comments, saying \"This is an outrage.\" Senator Jon Tester (Democrat, Montana) said \"This is ridiculous.\" and AIG executives \"need to understand that the only reason they even have a job is because of the taxpayers.\" Senator Dick Durbin (Democrat, Illinois) said \"I've had it.\" and \"The fact that they continue to do it while we pour in billions of dollars is undefensible.\" Representative Paul Hodes (Democrat, New Hampshire) said \"I think AIG now stands for arrogance, incompetence and greed.\"\n\nRepresentative Barney Frank (Democrat, Massachusetts), Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said paying these bonuses would be \"rewarding incompetence\" and \"These people may have a right to their bonuses. They don't have a right to their jobs forever.\" Representative Mark Kirk (Republican, Illinois) said \"AIG should not be on welfare from Uncle Sam, and yet paying bonuses and transferring a considerable amount of taxpayer funds to entities overseas.\" Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said \"It makes me angry. I slammed the phone more than a few times on discussing AIG.\" Lawrence Summers, Director of the National Economic Council, said \"The easy thing would be to just say, you know, ‘Off with their heads,’ and violate the contracts.\" Austan Goolsbee, of the Council of Economic Advisers said \"I don't know why they would follow a policy that's really not sensible, is obviously going to ignite the ire of millions of people.\" and \"You worry about that backlash.\"\n\nRepresentative Barney Frank said \"I do want to stress, this initial intervention into AIG was not part of the congressional rescue plan.\", \"Before we were even asked by the Bush administration to do the rescue plan, President Bush‘s two top economic appointees Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson came to us and said--Mr. Bernanke, as head of the Federal Reserve is going to lend $85 billion to AIG under a statute that dates back to 1932. They didn't ask us. They didn't solicit our opinion. They simply informed us.\", and \"Since then, when we have voted, we have put tough conditions on. And, in fact, this won't be happening again. The conditions are so tough that there have been articles recently in \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" from banks complaining that we've made the conditions so tough they are going to give us our money back.\"\n\nRepresentative Thaddeus McCotter (R-Michigan) said in a speech to Congress, \"Every single Democrat in this House that voted for that bill voted to approve and protect those AIG bonuses.\" Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) said that much of the blame for the bonuses should be directed at the 74 Senators who voted for the bailout, \"... including now President Obama, who voted in favor of handing over an unprecedented amount of money and power to an unelected bureaucrat last August.\"\n\nOn March 19, 2009, the House of Representatives approved, by a vote of 328 to 93, a measure to levy a 90% tax on bonuses awarded by corporations receiving more than $5 billion in Treasury aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The House bill affects individuals who make $250,000 or more in total household income and bonuses paid or scheduled to be paid after December 31, 2008.\nThe Senate version of the bill is similar to the House bill except it will levy a 70% tax on bonuses awarded by corporations that are receiving any amount of Treasury aid from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The 70% tax will be paid through a 35% excise tax on the corporation and 35% tax on the receiver of the bonus.\n\nIn a March 22, 2009 Wall St. Journal editorial, Jonathan Clements, a Citi employee, wrote, \"... by mid-October, I will hit $250,000 in total income -- and have no incentive to earn any more income in 2009. At that point, I plan to ask Citi for an unpaid sabbatical.\" He also notes that some individuals have already received and spent most of their bonuses and will not be able to afford the tax.\n\nA March 24, 2009 CNN article said that private companies wouldn't feel comfortable doing business with the U.S. government if they thought the government would change the rules after the contracts have already been signed. Also on March 24, 2009, The Hill reported that Michael Feroli, a senior economist at JP Morgan, claimed that the tax would destroy one million U.S. jobs because it would put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies in other countries where the tax did not exist. A March 26, 2009 Associated Press article stated, \"Obama then warned the public against vilifying investors and entrepreneurs who are needed to keep the economy alive.\" \n\nCongressman Brad Sherman introduced a bill to restrict base salaries of employees of firms who have taken $5 billion or more in the Troubled Asset Relief Program by taxing all non-bonus compensation over $500,000. It is designed to tax all compensations, including all payments that may be \"re-named\" bonuses to ensure that individuals and firms will not escape the bonus tax.\n\nPolitical commentators and journalists have expressed an equally bipartisan outrage. Commentator Charles Krauthammer said \"I would deny them the bonuses if possible. I would be for an exemplary hanging or two. Have it in Times Square, invite Madame Defarge. You borrow a guillotine from the French and we could have a party.\" Mort Kondracke, another conservative commentator, said \"I was going to recommend boiling in oil in Times Square.\" MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said \"Sometime in early 2008, that company signed contracts with its employees that said: 'Even if you cause the company to fail and nearly bring down the worldwide financial system, you will still get a bonus.' I mean, who writes those contracts?\" Chuck Todd, also an MSNBC commentator, wrote that \"It's a lynch mob out there, and members of Congress seem to be carrying torches.\" Comedy Central host Jon Stewart said \"You know, they say angry populism is all the rage. Literally, it's been building for months, simmering. Our proletarian rage feels so unfocused. If only someone would step up and put on the kick me sign.\" and \"They're not good people.\" The New Jersey Star-Ledger editorial page read \"This band of \"best and brightest\" just blew a $62 billion hole in the company. What's to retain? Heads should be rolling. Besides, is there really that much cutthroat competition for such an overpaid bunch of losers?\"\n\nCNN reporter Carol Costello said \"Some political analysts fear public anger has reached a tipping point.\" Commentator William Kristol wrote \"Can capitalism survive the behavior of some capitalists? It's always been an open question. But if capitalism is to survive, shouldn't the Republican party, the party that defends democratic capitalism, be particularly vehement in denouncing its excesses? Isn't this a pretty spectacular one?\" Robert Lenzer wrote in Forbes that \"The $170 billion bailout of AIG and the $165 million bonus outrage are the result of reckless behavior by AIG and most especially by its egomaniacal former chairman, Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg. This supposed paragon of higher finance was just plain playing Russian roulette with his shareholders' money, destroying nearly $200 billion in equity and putting an onerous cost on Uncle Sam and taxpayers.\" Lenzer accused AIG and Greenberg of \"cowboy capitalism\", \"numbskull ... tomfoolery\", and \"rotten arrogance.\" Karim Bardeesy, writing in Slate, compared AIG to Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany, stating \"Sometimes the internal workings of a society are so rotten that it takes a complete outsider to come in and change the culture and the cultural production within it. Allies came in and rewrote constitutions for the corrupted societies in Japan and Germany after World War II.\"\n\nMSNBC host Keith Olbermann said \"Certainly, we can screw these guys out of these bonuses the way they screwed us.\" He has labeled the bonuses \"failure bonuses\" and \"failure rewards.\" George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said \"I have some question about fraud here. I mean, these contracts seem to have been written in haste when the company could not possibly have honored them short of a bailout.\" Turley also said that there is \"real social unrest\" and that \"Congress has finally pushed this country to the breaking point.\" John Kelso wrote in the Austin American-Statesman that \"irate Americans...are about to start chasing these guys around the castle the way the townsfolk with the torches went after Frankenstein\" and \"The gated communities these suits live in are gated for a reason. For when the revolution starts.\" He also wrote that AIG \"really stands for America Is Gyped. Avarice Is Great, or Actually, It's Graft.\" Susan Antilla, reporting for Bloomberg, wrote that \"The public is angry. They are steaming, off-with-their-heads mad at AIG and other financial companies for the greed and cheating that pushed us into a financial meltdown.\" and \"Americans want to see heads roll.\" Fred J. Joseph, commissioner of the Colorado division of securities and president of the North American Securities Administrators Association, said \"If these people could get their hands on pitchforks, they really would storm the castle.\"\n\nThe Washington Post reported that \"Hired guards stood watch outside the suburban Connecticut offices of AIG Financial Products, the division whose exotic derivatives brought the insurance giant to the brink of collapse last year. Inside, death threats and angry letters flooded e-mail inboxes. Irate callers lit up the phone lines. Senior managers submitted their resignations. Some employees didn't show up at all.\" The paper quoted one anonymous AIG executive as saying \"It's a mob effect. It's putting people's lives in danger.\" and another as saying \"It's going to blow up. I have a horrible, horrible, horrible feeling that this is going to end badly.\" The Associated Press quoted one anonymous AIG executive as saying \"It's scary. People are very, very nervous for their security.\" The AP reported that \"police cars that now regularly patrol the well-kept streets\" of a neighborhood of AIG executives. AIG has advised employees \"to avoid wearing the company logo\" and \"to travel in pairs at night and park in well-lit areas.\" Reuters quoted an anonymous senior equity salesman at a bank receiving TARP funds as saying \"At this point, it's like the French Revolution -- the mob has got the banks' heads in the guillotine.\"\n\nNBC Connecticut, through the Freedom of Information Act, obtained information about dozens of death threats that were made to employees of AIG and their families. Some of the people who made the threats left their email addresses and phone numbers, making it much easier for law enforcement officials to identify them.\n\nIn an online editorial for the \"Wall Street Journal\", James Taranto speculated that for bonus recipients living in New York City, if the 90% bonus tax passed by the United States House of Representatives is added to the Medicare FICA tax of 1.45%, plus the state and local taxes of 6.85% and 3.648%, respectively, it adds up to a tax rate of 101.948%. This means the individual receiving the bonus will have to pay more than he or she 'received' from the bonus.\n\nIn a nationally syndicated opinion column, economist Thomas Sowell claimed that the politicians who did the most to create the situation that led to the use of taxpayer money to fund the bonuses are now the same ones who are complaining the most about the bonuses. Sowell also wrote, \"If members of Congress can't be bothered to read the laws they pass, then they have no basis for whipping up lynch mob outrage against people who did read the law and acted within the law.\" \n\nMike Cassidy of the \"San Jose Mercury News\" wrote that the bonuses bring \"a whole new meaning to the phrase 'bank robber.'\" He also wrote \"These bankers and brokers and investing Svengalis knew exactly how their obscene cash-grabbing orgy would look to the rest of us. They just didn't care.\"\n\nAIG has defended the bonuses by citing contractual obligations. AIG also claims that only their executives can unwind their complex derivative deals. Rick Newman of US News & World Report argues that this is tantamount to extortion. MSNBC host David Shuster said \"The argument that these were so-called retention bonuses is undermined by the fact that 52 of the people who received them have already left the company.\"\n\nTo date, few people outside of AIG itself have defended AIG's payments of the bonuses. Former White House Press Secretary under the George W. Bush administration Dana Perino defended AIG, saying \"If they don't get it [the bonus], maybe they won't be motivated enough to try to help the company turn around.\" and accusing the \"rhetoric in Washington\" of \"demonizing people\". Terence Corcoran, writing in the \"Financial Post\", claims that AIG is innocent, and instead \"massive government failure\" on the part of Barack Obama, whom Corcoran claims \"doesn't get it,\" is at fault. Evan Newmark of \"The Wall Street Journal\" accused those attacking AIG of \"hysterical, bloodthirsty ravings\" and \"populist hurly-burly.\" Andrew Ross Sorkin of \"The New York Times\" argued the case for paying bonuses, saying there was likely some truth to AIG's claim that it needed to retain its top talent, and that its most talented employees could find employment elsewhere. Sorkin also said not paying the bonuses could spark problems across the business community. \"If you think this economy is a mess now, imagine what it would look like if the business community started to worry that the government would start abrogating contracts left and right,\" wrote Sorkin. Joshua Zumbrun of \"Forbes\" and Eliot Spitzer of \"Slate\" argued that the outrage over bonuses distracted from a larger issue: that AIG had taken much of the bailout money and used it to settle contracts with its counterparties, Wall Street banks, hedge funds and non-U.S. banks, at full price.\n\nConservative political commentator Rush Limbaugh defended AIG, saying \"We've got peasants with their pitchforks phoning in death threats at AIG. We have members of the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives sounding like communist dictators.\" Limbaugh's comments defended that the bonuses were legal and productive, saying \"This money went to American citizens. This money went mostly to American citizens who are registered Democrats. These people who got the bonus are going to spend it. That's called private sector stimulus...The ones who got the bonuses did so on the basis of sales success. These were reported as merit bonuses that they are contractually permitted to get. If you violate their contract, if you don't give them their bonus, you have got a lawsuit on your hands and 80% of this company is now owned by Barney Frank and Chris Dodd and [Nancy] Pelosi, and so they would be sued, the government would be sued by these people.\" \n\nAIG CEO Edward M. Liddy told Congress that he asked employees who received bonuses over $100,000 to give half back. David Shuster said \"That sounded half-assed to members of Congress who were both channeling and deflecting voter outrage.\"\n\nAIG has pointed out that Connecticut, the state where AIG is based, has a law called the Wage Act. According to the law, employers who don't pay employees the money which they are contractually obligated to pay, could ultimately be required to pay twice that amount.\n\nAs of March 23, 2009, 9 of the 10 highest paid AIG executives had agreed to give back their bonuses - and of the 20 highest paid, 15 had agreed to give back their bonuses.\n\nOn March 16, 2009, New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo sent a letter to AIG demanding \"the list of individuals who are to receive payments\" and \"a description of each individual's job description and performance at AIG Financial Products\" in order to determine \"whether any of the individuals receiving such payments were involved in the conduct that led to AIG's demise and subsequent bailout\" and \"whether, as you claim, such individuals are truly required to unwind AIG Financial Product's positions.\" AIG failed to respond, so Cuomo subpoenaed them for the names of the bonus recipients. Cuomo announced that 73 AIG employees were each paid more than $1 million in bonuses, saying \"AIG made more than 73 millionaires in the unit which lost so much money that it brought the firm to its knees, forcing a taxpayer bailout.\" and \"Something is deeply wrong with this outcome.\"\n\nOn March 21, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal issued a subpoena to AIG to find out why they gave out an additional $53 million in bonuses on top of the $165 million already reported.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, the Wall Street Journal published an article, Bankers Face Strict New Pay Cap, discussing a retroactive limit to bonus compensation \"inserted\" by Chris Dodd into the TARP bill that passed in the Senate. The same article went on to mention that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Lawrence Summers \"had called Sen. Dodd and asked him to reconsider\".\n\nOn March 17, 2009, Fox Business Network's Rich Edson first reported Senator Chris Dodd included a provision exempting such bonuses from the executive pay limits clause of the TARP. When the bill left conference, Dodd's provision had been removed and replaced with the explicit exemptions lobbied for by Geithner and Summers.\n\nAs Dodd explained in his March 18 interview on CNN, at Geithner and the Obama Administration's insistence he removed the language he had himself inserted and replaced it with Geithner and Summers' loophole, which thus allowed the bonuses which formed the basis for the AIG scandal.\n\nDodd retreated from his original statement that he did not know how the bill was changed Dodd was criticised by many in the Connecticut media for the apparent flip-flop. In a March 20, 2009 editorial the New Haven Register called Dodd \"a lying weasel\" The same day, Hartford Courant columnist Rick Green called on Dodd not to seek re-election in 2010.\n\nOn March 24, 2009, The New York Times printed the open letter of resignation of Jake DeSantis, an executive vice president of AIG’s financial products unit, to Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of AIG. DeSantis stated that he and the majority of AIG-F.P. employees had nothing to do with the money-losing credit default swaps, that many of them had lost much of their savings in the form of deferred compensation invested in the capital of AIG-F.P., that he and others had agreed to work for an annual salary of $1 out of a sense of duty to the company, that AIG-F.P. employees were assured many times following the government bailout in September 2008 that AIG would honor the pre-existing retention contracts with scheduled payments to be made in March 2009, and that AIG-F.P. employees believed they were let down by Liddy's lack of support against opportunistic political pressure. He also stated he was going to donate his March 2009 payment to those suffering from the global economic downturn.\n\n"}

For example, ovarian apoplexy is bleeding in the ovaries. The term formerly referred to what is now called a stroke; nowadays, health care professionals typically specify the type of apoplexy, such as cerebral, ovarian and pituitary apoplexy.\n\nInformally or metaphorically, the term \"apoplexy\" is associated with being furious, especially as \"apoplectic\".\n\nFrom the late 14th to the late 19th century, \"apoplexy\" referred to any sudden death that began with a sudden loss of consciousness, especially one in which the victim died within a matter of seconds after losing consciousness. The word \"apoplexy\" was sometimes used to refer to the symptom of sudden loss of consciousness immediately preceding death. Ruptured aortic aneurysms, and even heart attacks and strokes were referred to as apoplexy in the past, because before the advent of medical science, there was limited ability to differentiate abnormal conditions and diseased states. Although physiology as a medical field dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates, until the late 19th century physicians often had inadequate or inaccurate understandings of many of the human body's normal functions and abnormal presentations. Hence, identifying a specific cause of a symptom or of death often proved difficult or impossible.\n\nBecause the term by itself is now ambiguous, it is often coupled with a descriptive adjective to indicate the site of bleeding. For example, bleeding within the pituitary gland is called \"pituitary apoplexy\", and bleeding within the adrenal glands can be called \"adrenal apoplexy\".\n\nApoplexy also includes hemorrhaging with the gland and accompanying neurological problems such as confusion, headache, and impairment of consciousness.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3756610", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3756610", "title": "Badger-baiting", "text": "Badger-baiting\n\nBadger-baiting is a form of animal sport in which badgers are baited with dogs. A baiting session typically results in the death of the badger, and possibly serious injuries to the dogs.\n\nThe badger is a usually quiet and docile creature in its own domain; however, when cornered or when a threat is perceived it can possess impressive courage. Weighing up to thirty-five pounds when fully grown, the badger has an extraordinarily dangerous bite, which it is willing to use when threatened. In addition, badgers have extremely powerful claws, used for digging in hard earth, which are more than capable of injuring a dog. A formidable adversary for any dog, the badger was a sought-after victim for the fighting pit.\n\nIn order to use the badger's ability to defend itself to test the dog, artificial badger dens were built, captured badgers were put in them and then the dog was set on the badger. The badger would be placed in a box, which was furnished in imitation of its den and from there a tunnel led upward. The owner of the badger puts his animal in the box. The timekeeper is equipped with a watch and the badger's owner releases the dog for the fight. Whoever wants to pit his dog against the badger lets it slide into the tunnel. Usually the dog is seized immediately by the badger and the dog in turn grips the badger. Each bites, tears and pulls the other with all their might. The owner of the dog quickly pulls out the dog whose jaws are clamped obstinately onto the badger by its tail. The two are separated and the badger is returned to its den. Then the dog is sent back in to seize the badger and it again is drawn out with the badger. This scene is repeated over and over again. The more often a dog is able to seize the badger within a minute, so that both can be pulled out together, the more it is up to the task and is considered game.\nDrawing the badger came to England in the 18th century and soon became a very popular sideshow in the pit. It provided a new opportunity to win or lose money by betting. Drawing the badger thus became a permanent part of the fight in the pit. Baits were staged outside the pit in cellars or taverns, as an interesting attraction for the guests.\n\nTowards the middle 19th century Badger-baiting declined in popularity to be replaced by dog fighting, although some countryside villages kept holding such activities the Sunday after church.\n\nSome dog breeds were specifically developed for badger-baiting whilst several other breeds were used in this task in addition to more general vermin control; breeds include the Dachshund and terriers.\nApart from the cruelty towards badgers, dogs are also brutalized in the blood sport. Dogs usually suffer injuries of the face and neck. In some cases, the injuries are such that the dogs must be euthanized.\n\nToday, baiters often refrain from taking injured dogs to veterinarians as the doctor might understand what has taken place and report the owners to the police. For this reason the badger is often crippled and/or restrained to minimise the risk of injury to dogs. The badger's long front claws may be filed off; the canine teeth may be pulled out; the animal's limbs or jaw may be broken with a shovel. To inhibit the badger's movement, there are rumours that the tendons in its hind legs may be cut. Griffiths et al. mention nailing badgers to the ground by the tail. However the likelihood of these things is slim, given that badgers will attack furiously when cornered or touched. So, the chance of baiters being able to cut off claws or the like in advance of the fight, is extremely unlikely. \n\nWhen the badger can no longer fight, it is killed by the baiters using methods such as shooting, stabbing, or beating to death with a shovel. Dead badgers are sometimes dumped by the roadside to be mistaken for roadkill (a major cause of badger mortality).\n\nBadger baiting was outlawed in the United Kingdom as early as 1835, with the Cruelty to Animals Act. The practice of baiting of animals is now specifically forbidden under the Protection of Animals Act 1911.\n\nMoreover, the cruelty towards and death of the badger constitute offences under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992, and further offences under this act are inevitably committed to facilitate badger baiting (such as interfering with a sett, or the taking or the very possession of a badger for purposes other than nursing an injured animal to health). If convicted, badger baiters may face a sentence of up to 6 months in jail, a fine of up to £5000, as well as other punitive measures, such as community service or a ban from owning dogs.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, badgers and their setts are protected under the provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and the Wildlife Amendment Act, 2000.\n\nDespite having been illegal for over 170 years, badger baiting has continued in a clandestine manner throughout Britain and Ireland until the present day. In February 2009, the \"Sunday Times\" reported that badger-baiting is practised by \"hardcore terrier men\" who are internationally organized. The \"Sunday Times\" has also reported that there is little attention on the part of the Irish government towards animal cruelty in general. The report led to a police operation in Ulster in which a number of dogs were seized, but no arrests were made.\n\nIn Ireland the NPWS has secured ten convictions for the illegal persecution of badgers in the last 20 years.\n\nIn 2009, badger baiting was believed to be on the rise according to animal welfare organizations. Badger-baiting is often linked to other criminal activities, and some practitioners brag on social networks about their deeds.\n\nOn 2018, David Thomas was sentenced to 22 weeks and accomplice to 20 for setting dogs on badgers.\n\nCrime gangs, among them Northern Irish paramilitaries, have been reported to sell badgers up to £700 to fight with dogs.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "349855", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349855", "title": "Battle of Lade", "text": "Battle of Lade\n\n\"For war between the navy of Rhodes and the navy of Macedon in 201 BC, see Battle of Lade (201 BC).\"\n\nThe Battle of Lade (, \"Naumachia tēs Ladēs\") was a naval battle which occurred during the Ionian Revolt, in 494 BC. It was fought between an alliance of the Ionian cities (joined by the Lesbians) and the Persian Empire of Darius the Great, and resulted in a decisive victory for the Persians which all but ended the revolt.\n\nThe Ionian Revolt was triggered by the dissatisfaction of the Greek cities of Asia Minor with the tyrants appointed by Persia to rule them. In 499 BC, the then-tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras, launched a joint expedition with the Persian satrap Artaphernes to conquer Naxos, in an attempt to bolster his position in Miletus. The mission was a debacle, and sensing his imminent removal as tyrant, Aristagoras chose to incite the whole of Ionia into rebellion against the Persian king Darius the Great. Initially, in 498 BC, the Ionians went on the offensive, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, capturing Sardis, before suffering defeat at the Battle of Ephesus. The revolt then spread to Caria and Cyprus. Three years of Persian campaigning across Asia Minor followed, with no decisive effect. By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped, and made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus.\n\nThe Ionians sought to defend Miletus by sea, leaving the defense of Miletus to the Milesians. The Ionian fleet gathered at the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus. The Persians were uncertain of victory at Lade, so attempted to persuade some of the Ionian contingents to defect. Although this was unsuccessful at first, when the Persians finally attacked the Ionians, the Samian fleet accepted the Persian offer. As the Persian and Ionian fleets met, the Samians sailed away from the battle, causing the collapse of the Ionian battle line. Although the Chian contingent and a few other ships remained and fought bravely against the Persians, the battle was lost.\n\nWith the defeat at Lade, the Ionian Revolt was all but ended. The next year, the Persians reduced the last rebel strongholds, and began the process of bringing peace to the region. The Ionian Revolt constituted the first major conflict between ancient Greece and Persia, and as such represents the first phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Asia Minor had been brought back into the Persian fold, Darius vowed to punish Athens and Eretria for their support of the revolt. Moreover, seeing that the myriad city states of Greece posed a continued threat to the stability of his empire, he decided to conquer the whole of Greece. In 492 BC, the first Persian invasion of Greece, the next phase of the Greco-Persian Wars, would begin as a direct consequence of the Ionian Revolt.\n\nPractically the only primary source for the Ionian Revolt is the Greek historian Herodotus. Herodotus, who has been called the 'Father of History', was born in 484 BC in Halicarnassus, Asia Minor (then under Persian overlordship). He wrote his 'Enquiries' (Greek—\"Historia\"; English—\"(The) Histories\") around 440–430 BC, trying to trace the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, which would still have been relatively recent history (the wars finally ending in 450 BC). Herodotus's approach was entirely novel, and at least in Western society, he does seem to have invented 'history' as we know it. As Holland has it: \"For the first time, a chronicler set himself to trace the origins of a conflict not to a past so remote so as to be utterly fabulous, nor to the whims and wishes of some god, nor to a people's claim to manifest destiny, but rather explanations he could verify personally.\"\n\nSome subsequent ancient historians, despite following in his footsteps, criticised Herodotus, starting with Thucydides. Nevertheless, Thucydides chose to begin his history where Herodotus left off (at the Siege of Sestos), and therefore evidently felt that Herodotus's history was accurate enough not to need re-writing or correcting. Plutarch criticised Herodotus in his essay \"On The Malignity of Herodotus\", describing Herodotus as \"Philobarbaros\" (barbarian-lover), for not being pro-Greek enough, which suggests that Herodotus might actually have done a reasonable job of being even-handed. A negative view of Herodotus was passed on to Renaissance Europe, though he remained well read. However, since the 19th century his reputation has been dramatically rehabilitated by archaeological finds which have repeatedly confirmed his version of events. The prevailing modern view is that Herodotus generally did a remarkable job in his \"Historia\", but that some of his specific details (particularly troop numbers and dates) should be viewed with skepticism. Nevertheless, there are still some historians who believe Herodotus made up much of his story.\n\nIn the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization, significant numbers of Greeks had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there. These settlers were from three tribal groups: the Aeolians, Dorians and Ionians. The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria, founding the twelve cities which made up Ionia. These cities were Miletus, Myus and Priene in Caria; Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedos, Teos, Clazomenae, Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia; and the islands of Samos and Chios. The cities of Ionia had remained independent until they were conquered by the famous Lydian king Croesus, in around 560 BC. The Ionian cities then remained under Lydian rule until Lydia was in turn conquered by the nascent Achaemenid Empire of Cyrus the Great. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule. Elsewhere in the empire, Cyrus was able to identify elite native groups to help him rule his new subjects—such as the priesthood of Judea. No such group existed in Greek cities at this time; while there was usually an aristocracy, this was inevitably divided into feuding factions. The Persians thus settled for the sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city, even though this drew them into the Ionians' internal conflicts. Furthermore, a tyrant might develop an independent streak, and have to be replaced. The tyrants themselves faced a difficult task; they had to deflect the worst of their fellow citizens' hatred, while staying in the favour of the Persians.\n\nAbout 40 years after the Persian conquest of Ionia, and in the reign of the fourth Persian king, Darius the Great, the stand-in Milesian tyrant Aristagoras found himself in this familiar predicament. In 500 BC, Aristagoras was approached by some exiles from Naxos, who asked him to take control of the island. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen his position in Miletus by conquering Naxos, Aristagoras approached the satrap of Lydia, Artaphernes, proposing a joint attack on Naxos, to which Artaphernes assented.\n\nThe expedition sailed in the spring of 499 BC but quickly descended into a debacle The force laid siege to the Naxians for four months, but eventually the Persians and Aristagoras both ran out of money. The force therefore sailed despondently back to the mainland. Aristagoras found himself in dire straits and fully expected to be stripped of his position by Artaphernes. In a desperate attempt to save himself, Aristagoras chose to incite his own subjects, the Milesians, to revolt against their Persian masters, thereby beginning the Ionian Revolt. Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras's personal motives, it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway, the primary grievance being the tyrants installed by the Persians. Aristagoras's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box; they incited rebellion across Ionia (and Aeolis and Doris), and tyrannies were everywhere abolished, and democracies established in their place.\n\nAristagoras had brought all of Hellenic Asia Minor into revolt, but evidently realised that the Greeks would need other allies in order to fight the Persians. In the winter of 499 BC, he sailed to mainland Greece to try to recruit allies. He failed to persuade the Spartans, but the cities of Athens and Eretria agreed to support the rebellion. In the spring of 498 BC, an Athenian force of twenty triremes, accompanied by five from Eretria, for a total of twenty-five triremes set sail for Ionia. They joined up with the main Ionian force near Ephesus.\nThis force was then guided by the Ephesians through mountains to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. The Greeks caught the Persians unawares, and were able to capture the lower city. However the lower city then caught fire, and the Greeks, demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus. The Persians troops in Asia Minor followed the Greek force, catching them outside Ephesus. It is clear that the demoralised and tired Greeks were no match for the Persians, and were completely routed in the ensuing battle at Ephesus. The Ionians who escaped the battle made for their own cities, while the remaining Athenians and Eretrians managed to return to their ships, and sailed back to Greece.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the revolt spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis, and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion. For the next three years, the Persian army and navy were fully occupied with fighting the rebellions in Caria and Cyprus, and Ionia seems to have had an uneasy peace during these years. At the height of the Persian counter-offensive, Aristagoras, sensing the untenability of his position, decided to abandon his position as leader of Miletus, and of the revolt, and he left Miletus. Herodotus, who evidently has a rather negative view of him, suggests that Aristagoras simply lost his nerve and fled.\n\nBy the sixth year of the revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The available land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, and the Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at this time. It is therefore possible that he was in overall command of this Persian offensive. Hearing of the approach of this force, the Ionians met at the Panionium (the sacred meeting ground), and decided not to attempt to fight on land, leaving the Milesians to defend their walls. Instead, they opted to gather every ship they could, and make for the island of Lade, off the coast of Miletus, in order to \"fight for Miletus at sea\".\n\nThe Ionian cities were joined in this battle by the Aeolians of Lesbos. Herodotus lists the number of ships provided by each state:\n\nHerodotus gives the order of the Ionian battle line as being, from east to west; Miletus—Priene—Myus—Teos—Chios—Erythraea—Phocaea—Lesbos—Samos.\n\nHerodotus says that there were 600 ships in the Persian fleet, provided by the Phoenicians (who were most eager to fight), the Egyptians, Cilicians, and the Cypriots, whose own revolt had recently been subdued. The Persian fleet may have been commanded by the veteran Median general Datis; Persian records seem to suggest that he was sent by Darius to Ionia at around about the time of Lade. However, Herodotus does not name any Persian commanders in this campaign.\n\nWhen the Persians arrived off the coast of Lade and learned the number of Ionian ships, they began to worry that they would not be able to defeat the Greeks, and feared Darius's wrath should they fail. The Ionian tyrants who had been expelled at the beginning of the revolt were present, and according to Herodotus, they were now given instructions by the Persians: \"Men of Ionia, let each one of you now show that he has done good service to the king's house; let each one of you try to separate your own countrymen from the rest of the allied power. Set this promise before them: they will suffer no harm for their rebellion, neither their temples nor their houses will be burnt, nor will they in any way be treated more violently than before. But if they will not do so and are set on fighting, then utter a threat that will restrain them: if they are defeated in battle, they will be enslaved; we will make eunuchs of their boys, and carry their maidens captive to Bactra, and hand over their land to others.\" The tyrants thus sent messages to their own kinsman, but the Ionians refused the offers. Critically, each group thought that only they had been approached—there does not seem to have been any discussion of this offer between the different contingents, and the possibility for treachery does not seem to have been realised.\n\nThe Ionians did however hold meetings to discuss the conduct of the battle. Dionysius, the Phocaean general, offered to train and lead the Greek force: \"Our affairs, men of Ionia, stand on the edge of a razor, whether to be free men or slaves, and runaway slaves at that. If you now consent to endure hardships, you will have toil for the present time, but it will be in your power to overcome your enemies and gain freedom; but if you will be weak and disorderly, I see nothing that can save you from paying the penalty to the king for your rebellion. Believe me and entrust yourselves to me; I promise you that (if the gods deal fairly with us) either our enemies shall not meet us in battle, or if they do they shall be utterly vanquished.\" Dionysius thus began an intensive training program, leading the fleet out every day to train the rowers in ramming manoeuvers, and the marines in combat. For seven days the Ionians accepted this regime, but being unused to the hard work, they refused to obey thereafter, and stayed in camp instead. According to Herodotus, upon seeing the resultant discontent and division in the Ionian camp, the Samians decided to accept the Persian offer of lenience in return for desertion. However, some modern historians reject the notion of dissent in the Greek camp. Herodotus derived his account of Lade from the Samians themselves, and it is suggested that, seeking to excuse their treachery, they came up with this story. At any rate, the Samians remained with the other Greeks in the run up to the battle.\n\nSoon after the rebellion against Dionysius, the Persian fleet moved to attack the Ionians, who sailed out to meet them. The ensuing battle was evidently confused, since Herodotus admits that \"which of the Ionians were brave men or cowards then in that sea-fight I cannot exactly say; for they all blame each other\". It is nevertheless clear that very early on in the battle, the Samian contingent hoisted their sails, as had been agreed, and fled the battlefield. However, 11 Samian ships refused to desert the other Ionians, and remained at the battle. At some later date, the Samians erected a pillar in their marketplace commemorating the bravery and sacrifice of these crews. Seeing the Samians leave, their neighbours on the western wing, the Lesbians, also fled. The whole west-wing of the Ionian battle line thus very quickly collapsed. Other Ionian contingents also fled as the situation became more desperate.\n\nOnly the large Chian navy seems to have stood their ground, perhaps accompanied by a few other ships. They fought valiantly, but had huge casualties. Eventually the remaining Chian ships sailed away back to Chios, thereby ending the battle.\n\nWith the defeat of the Ionian fleet, the revolt was effectively over. Miletus was closely invested, the Persians \"mining the walls and using every device against it, until they utterly captured it\". According to Herodotus, most of the men were killed, and the women and children were enslaved. Archaeological evidence partially substantiates this, showing widespread signs of destruction, and abandonment of much of the city in the aftermath of Lade. However, some Milesians did remain in (or quickly returned to) Miletus, though the city would never recapture its former greatness. Miletus was thus notionally \"left empty of Milesians\"; the Persians took the city and coastal land for themselves, and gave the rest of the Milesian territory to Carians from Pedasus. The captive Milesians were brought before Darius in Susa, who settled them on the coast of the Persian Gulf, near the mouth of the Tigris.\n\nMany Samians were appalled by the actions of their generals at Lade, and resolved to emigrate before their old tyrant, Aeaces, returned to rule them. They accepted an invitation from the people of Zancle to settle on the coast of Sicily, and took with them such Milesians as had escaped from the Persians. Samos itself was spared from destruction by the Persians because of the Samian defection at Lade. Meanwhile, Dionysius of Phocaea went to Sicily, and established himself as a pirate, preying on Carthaginian ships.\n\nMost of Caria surrendered to the Persians in aftermath of Lade, although some strongholds had to be captured through force. The Persian fleet and army wintered at Miletus, before setting out in 493 BC to finally stamp out the last embers of the revolt. They attacked and captured the islands of Chios, Lesbos and Tenedos and then moved over to the mainland, and captured each of the remaining cities of Ionia. Although the cities of Ionia were undoubtedly harrowed in the aftermath, none seems to have suffered quite the fate of Miletus. The Persian army then re-conquered the settlements on the Asian side of the Propontis, while the fleet sailed up the European coast of the Hellespont, taking each settlement in turn. With all of Asia Minor now firmly returned to Persian rule, the revolt was finally over.\n\nFor the Persians, the only unfinished business that remained by the end of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated in the famous Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.\n\n\n\n"}

Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present. The Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem will be used instead, and on 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternate logo for the uniforms (seen at right). IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes.\"\n\nAs of January 2018, the IOC had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the 2014 Winter Olympics and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes meaning that their Sochi medals and results are reinstated but decided that there was sufficient evidence against 11 athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three Russian athletes are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games. After the CAS decision was announced, the four-time Olympic champion in biathlon Alexander Tikhonov demanded to call to account the President of the IOC for \"false accusations\". Russia’s sports minister Pavel Kolobkov wanted the IOC to ensure the participation of these Russian athletes at the Olympics in Pyeongchang. \n\nAn original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements are met, can the athletes be considered for invitation to the games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool.\nThe final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169.\n\nOn 22 February Alexander Krushelnitskiy of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team was stripped of his bronze medal in mixed doubles curling after testing positive for meldonium.\n\nIn the past, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, and other officials had said that it would be a humiliation for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. However, his spokesman later said that no boycott had been discussed. After the IOC decision was announced, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, announced that no Chechen athletes would participate under a neutral flag. On 6 December, Putin stated that the Russian government would not prevent any athletes from participating at the Games as individuals, but there were calls from other politicians for a boycott. Gennady Zyuganov, a leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed to send fans with a Soviet Victory Banner. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov has said that the United States \"fears honest competition\", affirming Vladimir Putin's position who had said that the United States used its influence within the International Olympic Committee to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". According to \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\", a popular Russian newspaper, 86% of the Russian population oppose participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag.\n\nDespite the OAR designation, many Russian fans still attended the Games, wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.\n\nThe IOC's decision was criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, who said that the IOC has issued \"a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC’s] and Russia’s commercial and political interests\". He also emphasized that Russian whistleblowers provided empirical evidence that \"99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping.\" According to Robertson, \"[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you’re done\". \"There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased\", he added.\nIt was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to achieve Grigory Rodchenkov's (main whistleblower) extradition to Russia.\n\nJustin Peters of \"Slate\" magazine wrote that the IOC \"ended up with a situation that seemed to negate the entire point of the sanctions against Russia. The IOC did not want there to be a Russian Olympic team at the Pyeongchang Games. And yet the hockey, curling, and figure-skating arenas are full of teams of Russian Olympians ... [this is] a half-hearted wrist slap issued by an entity that appears more interested in saving face than in protecting athletes\".\n\nIOC Decision to overturn life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals met fierce criticism among Olympic officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach who had said this decision is \"extremely disappointing and surprising.\" Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer has said that \"the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment\".\n\"[CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically”, - he added.\n\nOn 20 September 2017, South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in said the country is pushing to ensure security at Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games amid rising tensions over nuclear tests and a series of missile launches conducted by North Korea during the summer. However, on the next day, French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Laura Flessel-Colovic said France’s Winter Olympics team will boycott the games unless South Korea's security is guaranteed.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, Austria and Germany joined France in considering not attending the Games. Karl Stoss, head of Austria’s national Olympic committee, said that, \"if the situation worsens and the security of our athletes is no longer guaranteed, we will not go to South Korea.\" Several days later, Laura Flessel-Colovic reaffirmed France's participation in the games. Austria and Germany did not boycott the Games.\n\nKim Yo-jong, the younger sister of dictator Kim Jong-un, attended the opening ceremony and shook hands with the South Korean President Moon Jae-in. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.\n\nLike in recent Olympic games, the scheduling of several events were influenced primarily by United States broadcast rightsholder NBC (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible). U.S. Eastern Time is 14 hours behind Korean Time. Thus, figure skating events were scheduled around 10:00 Korean Time in the morning so they could air live on NBC around 20:00 U.S. Eastern Time during the U.S. primetime hours, disrupting competitors' regular routines, and leading to small crowds at the arena.\n\nConversely, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, forcing biathletes to both ski and shoot under floodlights, colder temperatures, and gustier winds.\n\nDuring the opening ceremony, NBC analyst Joshua Cooper Ramo noted that Japan occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945, and then added, \"But every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\" In \"The Korea Times\", Jung Min-ho called the comment \"incorrect and insensitive,\" writing that \"Tens of thousands of Koreans and non-Koreans alike have criticized Ramo and NBC Sports on their social media, urging them to correct this misinformation and apologize.\" In response to this backlash, NBC issued an on-air apology and Ramo was fired from his job at NBC the next day.\n\nMany snow events were plagued by high winds, causing dangerous conditions. An opening ceremony took place in extreme cold with a wind chill temperature of -22°C and some visitors left early because of the harsh cold.\n\nDutchman Niek van der Velden broke his arm due to a fall caused by the wind and in a trainings run for the men's slopestyle event. Due to the high winds many events were delayed. Snowboarding, freestyle skiing, alpine skiing, ski jumping and biathlon sessions were postponed or even cancelled. On 14 February, the fifth day of the Games, only one Alpine skiing event had been contested (Men's combined) out of the original four.\n\nAfter the qualification of the women's slopestyle was cancelled, there were still massive winds in the final session. Of the 25 participants, only five managed to stay on their feet during the first run. No snowboarders recorded two clear runs. Several snowboarders said that the final was \"irresponsible\", \"too dangerous\" and \"should never have been held\". According to the FIS, the conditions were \"within the norm\".\n\nOn 14 February there was such a strong wind on the Olympic Park, that spectators were sent inside to shelter for the wind and all activities of the Olympic park were postponed. Parts of tents became detached and temporary structures and Coca-Cola fridges were broken. The media tents had been closed as well due to high winds.\n\nEnvironmental groups have raised concerns surrounding the deforestation from the slopes of Gariwang mountain to build the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Officials claim it is necessary as it is the only slope that will accommodate Olympic requirements and the forest will be restored after the games are done. Environmental groups are skeptical as the forest includes old growth of ancient and rare species. \n\nThe official website of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games posted a world map without the Japanese archipelago. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide requested an immediate correction of the map. The PyeongChang organizing committee corrected the map and said it was a \"simple mistake\".\n\nBoth the International Olympic Committee and the PyeongChang Organizing Committee decided to exclude Iranian and North Korean athletes from their free giveaway of Samsung Galaxy Note 8 smartphones. The decision was due to the concern and delay over confirming whether giving away mobile devices to Iranian and North Korean athletes would violate the UN sanctions against Iran and North Korea. In response, the Iranian government summoned the South Korean envoy to complain about the situation.\n\nAs the IOC confirmed that distributing mobile devices would not violate the UN sanction of Iran, which is being uplifted after Iran's JCPOA in 2015, all participating athletes were given the Galaxy Note 8 regardless of their nationalities. However, due to the still active UN sanction, North Korean athletes were given the smart phones on the condition that they would return the devices to the organizing committee before going back to their home country.\n\nThe Winter Olympics have again caused comments about the dog meat trade issue in Korea. Figure skater Meagan Duhamel complained that eating dog meat is common and legal in Korea. Also speed skater Jan Blokhuijsen made a comment during a press conference to the host South Koreans to \"treat dogs better in this country\", criticizing dog meat eating culture of South Korea. Dogs are bred and raised for consumption, allegedly under poor conditions. Numerous activist groups have documented cases of dogs being burned, electrocuted, beaten and boiled alive. The myth, which states that battering a dog would increase the tenderness of its meat, is still believed by some people in Asia. In the run-up to the Olympics, South Korea closed its biggest dog meat market. More than 800,000 dogs were being kept in the market which accounts for about a third of the country's dog meat consumption.\n\nOn February 14, 2018, a man impersonating Kim Jong-un was ejected from the stands after walking through the North Korean cheerleading squad. \n\nOn February 15, 2018, IOC member Adam Pengilly was not allowed to enter the parking lot, since the route was only for buses, not pedestrians. Denied by security, Pengilly blamed and shoved security. According to security, Pengilly said to the security \"If you report this incident to authority, you won't be able to work in Korea.\". After the investigation, Pengilly was sent home from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and apologised for his action, but denied a confrontation. IOC President Thomas Bach met with the security official on February 17 to apologize in person.\n"}

{"id": "2719004", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2719004", "title": "Dieter Dengler", "text": "Dieter Dengler\n\nDieter Dengler (May 22, 1938 – February 7, 2001) was a German-born United States Navy aviator during the Vietnam War and later a private aircraft test pilot and commercial airline pilot. He was one of two survivors, the other being Phisit Intharathat, out of seven prisoners of war (POWs) who escaped from a Pathet Lao prison camp in Laos. He was rescued after 23 days on the run following six months of torture and imprisonment and was the first captured U.S. airman to escape enemy captivity during the Vietnam war.\n\nDieter Dengler was born and raised in the small town of Wildberg, in the Black Forest region of the German state of Baden-Württemberg. He grew up not knowing his father, who had been drafted into the German army in 1939 and was killed during World War II on the Eastern Front during the winter of 1943/44. Dieter became very close to his mother and brothers. Dengler's maternal grandfather, Hermann Schnuerle, refused to vote for Adolf Hitler in the 1934 elections (which was considered a referendum on Hitler). Subsequently he was paraded around town with a placard around his neck, was spat upon and was then sent to labor in a rock mine for a year. Dengler credited his grandfather's resolve as a major inspiration during his time in Laos. His grandfather's steadfastness despite the great risks was one reason Dengler refused a North Vietnamese demand that he sign a document condemning American aggression in Southeast Asia.\n\nDengler's first experience with aircraft was during World War II when he witnessed an Allied fighter plane firing its guns as it flew very close past a window young Dieter was peering out of in his hometown. From that moment on, Dengler said he knew that he wanted to be a pilot.\n\nHe grew up in extreme poverty but always found ways to help his family survive. Dieter and his brothers would go into bombed-out buildings, tear off wallpaper and bring it to his mother to boil for the nutrients in the wheat-based wallpaper paste. When members of the small group of Moroccans who lived in the area would slaughter sheep for their meals Dieter would sneak over to their lodgings to take the scraps and leftovers they wouldn't eat and his mother would make dinner from them. He also built a bicycle by scavenging from dumps. Dieter was apprenticed to a blacksmith at the age of 14. The blacksmith and the other boys, who worked six days a week building giant clocks and clock faces to repair German cathedrals, regularly beat him. Later in life Dieter actually thanked his master \"for his disciplined training and for helping Dieter become more capable, self-reliant and yes, 'tough enough to survive'\".\n\nAfter seeing an ad in an American magazine, expressing a need for pilots, he decided to go to the United States. Although a family friend agreed to sponsor him he lacked money for passage and came up with a plan to independently salvage brass and other metals to sell.\n\nIn 1956, when he turned 18 and upon completion of his apprenticeship, Dengler hitchhiked to Hamburg and spent two weeks surviving on the streets before the ship set sail for New York City. While on the ship he saved fruit and sandwiches for the coming days and when going through customs the agent was astonished when the food tumbled out of his shirt. He lived on the streets of Manhattan for just over a week and eventually found his way to an Air Force recruiter. He was assured that piloting aircraft was what the Air Force was all about so he enlisted in June 1957 and went to basic training at Lackland AFB in San Antonio, Texas. After basic training, Dengler spent two years peeling potatoes and then transferred to a motor pool as a mechanic. His qualifications as a machinist led to an assignment as a gunsmith. He passed the test for aviation cadets but was told that only college grads were selected to be pilots and his enlistment expired before he was selected for pilot training.\n\nAfter his discharge Dengler joined his brother working in a bakery shop near San Francisco and enrolled in San Francisco City College, then transferred to the College of San Mateo, where he studied aeronautics. Upon completion of two years of college he applied for the US Navy aviation cadet program and was accepted.\n\nDieter would do whatever it took to become a pilot. In his inaugural flight at primary flight training, for example, the instructor told Dieter that if he became airsick and vomited in the cockpit that he would receive a \"down\" on his record. Students were only allowed three downs then they would wash out of flight training. The instructor of course, took the plane through spins and loops causing Dieter to become dizzy and disoriented. Knowing he was about to vomit and not wanting to receive a \"down\" Dieter took off his boot, threw up into it and put it back on. At the end of the flight the instructor checked the cockpit and could smell the vomit, but couldn't find any evidence of it. He didn't get a \"down\".\n\nAfter his completion of flight training Dengler went to the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, Texas for training as an attack pilot in the Douglas AD Skyraider. He joined VA-145 while the squadron was on shore duty at Naval Air Station Alameda, California. In 1965 the squadron joined the carrier . In December the carrier set sail for the coast of Vietnam. He was stationed initially at Dixie Station, off South Vietnam then moved north to Yankee Station for operations against North Vietnam.\n\nOn February 1, 1966, the day after the carrier began flying missions from Yankee Station, Lieutenant, Junior Grade Dengler launched from the \"Ranger\" with three other aircraft on an interdiction mission against a truck convoy that had been reported in North Vietnam. Thunderstorms forced the pilots to divert to their secondary target, a road intersection located west of the Mu Gia Pass in Laos. At the time, U.S. air operations in Laos were classified \"secret\". Visibility was poor due to smoke from burning fields, and upon rolling in on the target, LTJG Dengler and the remainder of his flight lost sight of one another. Visibility was poor, and as Dengler rolled his Skyraider in on the target after flying for two-and-a-half hours into enemy territory, he was hit by anti-aircraft fire.\n\n\"There was a large explosion on my right side,\" he remembered when interviewed shortly before his death in 2001.\n\nIt was like lightning striking. The right wing was gone. The airplane seemed to cartwheel through the sky in slow motion. There were more explosions - boom, boom, boom - and I was still able to guide the plane into a clearing in Laos.\n\nHe said: \"Many times, people have asked me if I was afraid. Just before dying, there is no more fear. I felt I was floating.\"\n\nThrown 100 ft from the plane in a crash-landing, Dengler lay unconscious for a few minutes before running into the jungle to hide.\n\nWhen his squadron mates realized that he had been downed, they remained confident that he would be rescued.\n\nImmediately after he was shot down, Dengler smashed his survival radio and hid most of his other survival equipment to keep Vietnamese or Lao search parties from finding it. The day after being shot down Dengler was apprehended by Pathet Lao troops, the Laotian equivalent of the communist National Liberation Front.\n\nHe was marched through the jungle, was tied on the ground to four stakes spreadeagled in order to stop him escaping at night. In the morning his face would be swollen from mosquito bites and he was unable to see. After an early escape attempt he was recaptured while drinking from a spring. According to Dengler he was tortured in retaliation:\n\nI had escaped from them, [and] they wanted to get even.\n\nHe was hung upside down by his ankles with a nest of biting ants over his face until he lost consciousness, suspended in a freezing well at night - so that if sleep came, he might drown. On other occasions he was dragged through villages by a water buffalo, to the amusement of his guards, as they goaded the animal with a whip. He was asked by Pathet Lao officials to sign a document condemning the United States, but he refused and as a result he was tortured as tiny wedges of bamboo were inserted under his fingernails and into incisions on his body which grew and festered.\n\n\"They were always thinking of something new to do to me\" Dengler recalled. \"One guy made a rope tourniquet around my upper arm. He inserted a piece of wood, and twisted and twisted until my nerves cut against the bone. The hand was completely unusable for six months.\"\n\nAfter some weeks Dengler was handed over to the Vietnamese. As they marched him through a village, a man slipped Dengler's engagement ring from his finger. Dengler complained to his guards. They found the culprit, summarily chopped off his finger with a machete and handed the ring back to Dengler.\n\n\"I realized right there and then that you don't fool around with the Viet Cong\", he said.\n\nDengler had trained in escaping and survival at the navy SERE survival school, where he had twice escaped from the mock-POW camp run by SERE instructors and Marine guards and was planning a third escape when the training ended. He had also set a record as the only student to actually gain weight (three pounds) during the SERE course; his childhood experiences had made him unafraid of eating whatever he could find and he had feasted on food the course instructors had thrown in the garbage.\n\nDengler was eventually brought to a prison camp near the village of Par Kung where he met other POWs. The other six prisoners were:\n\nExcept for Martin, an Air Force helicopter pilot who had been shot down in North Vietnam nearly a year before, the other prisoners were civilians employed by Air America, a civilian airline owned by the Central Intelligence Agency. The civilians had been in Pathet Lao hands for over two and a half years when Dengler joined them.\n\n\"I had hoped to see other pilots. What I saw horrified me. The first one who came out was carrying his intestines around in his hands. One had no teeth - plagued by awful infections, he had begged the others to knock them out with a rock and a rusty nail in order to release pus from his gums\".\n\n\"They had been there for two and a half years,\" said Dengler. \"I looked at them and it was just awful. I realized that was how I would look in six months. I had to escape.\"\n\nThe day he arrived in the camp, Dengler advised the other prisoners that he intended to escape and invited them to join him. They advised that he wait until the monsoon season when there would be plenty of water. Shortly after Dengler arrived, the prisoners were moved to a new camp ten miles away at Hoi Het. After the move, a strong debate ensued among the prisoners with Dengler, Martin and Prasit arguing for escape which the other prisoners, particularly Phisit initially opposed.\n\nAs food began to run out, tension between the men grew: they were given just a single handful of rice to share while the guards would stalk deer, pulling the grass out of the animal's stomach for the prisoners to eat while they shared the meat. The prisoners' only \"treats\" were snakes they occasionally caught from the communal latrine or the rats that lived under their hut which they could spear with sharpened bamboo. At night the men were handcuffed together and shackled to wooden foot blocks. They suffered chronic dysentery and were made to lie in their excrement until morning.\n\nAfter several months, one of the Thai prisoners overheard the guards talking about shooting them in the jungle and making it look like an escape attempt. They too, were starving and wanted to return to their villages. With that revelation, everyone agreed and a date to escape was set. Their plan was to take over the camp and signal a C-130 Hercules flare-ship that made nightly visits to the area. Dengler loosened logs under the hut that allowed the prisoners to squeeze through. The plan was for him to go out when the guards were eating and seize their weapons and pass them to Phisit Intharathat and Promsuwan while Martin and DeBruin procured others from other locations.\n\n\"I planned to capture the guards at lunchtime, when they put down their rifles to get their food. There were two minutes and twenty seconds in the day when I could strike.\" In that time Dengler had to release all the men from their handcuffs.\n\nOn June 29, 1966 while the guards were eating, the group slipped out of their hand-cuffs and foot restraints and grabbed the guard's unattended weapons which included M1 rifles, Chinese automatic rifles, an American carbine and at least one sub-machine gun as well as an early version of the AK47 automatic rifle, which Dengler used during the escape from the POW camp. Dengler went out first followed by Martin. He went to the guard hut and seized an M1 for himself and passed the American carbine to Martin. The guards realized the prisoners had escaped and five of them rushed toward Dengler, who shot at least three with the AK47. Phisit killed another guard as he reached for his rifle. Two others ran off, presumably to get help, although at least one had been wounded. The seven prisoners split into three groups. DeBruin was originally supposed to go with Dengler and Martin but decided to go with To, who was recovering from a fever and unable to keep up. They intended to get over the nearest ridge and wait for rescue. Dengler and Martin went off by themselves with the intention of heading for the Mekong River to escape to Thailand, but they never got more than a few miles from the camp from which they had escaped.\n\n\"Seven of us escaped,\" said Dengler. \"I was the only one who came out alive.\"\n\nWith the exception of Phisit, who was recaptured and later rescued by Laotian troops, none of the other prisoners were ever seen again. DeBruin was reportedly captured and placed in another camp, then disappeared in 1968.\n\nEscape proved to be hazardous. Soon, the two men's feet were white, mangled stumps from trekking through the dense jungle. They found the sole of an old tennis shoe, which they wore alternately, strapping it onto a foot with rattan for a few moments' respite. In this way they were able to make their way to a fast-flowing river.\n\n\"It was the highway to freedom,\" said Dengler, \"We knew it would flow into the Mekong River, which would take us over the border into Thailand and to safety.\"\n\nThe men built a raft and floated downstream on ferocious rapids, tying themselves to trees at night to stop themselves being washed away in the torrential water. By morning they would be covered in mud and hundreds of leeches. When they thought they were on their way to the Mekong, they discovered that they had gone around in a circle. They had spotted several villages but had not been detected. They set up camp in an abandoned village where they found shelter from the nearly incessant rain. They had brought rice with them and found other food, but were still on the verge of starvation. Their intent had been to signal a C-130 but at first lacked the energy to build a fire using primitive methods of rubbing bamboo together. Dengler finally managed to locate carbine cartridges that Martin had thrown away and used their powder to enhance the tinder and got a fire going. That night they lit torches and waved them in the shape of an S and O when a C-130 came over. The airplane circled and dropped a couple of flares and they were overjoyed, believing they had been spotted. They woke up the next morning to find the landscape covered by fog and drizzle, but when it lifted, no rescue force appeared.\n\nMartin, who was weak from starvation and was suffering from malaria, wanted to approach a nearby Akha village to steal some food. Dengler knew it was not a good idea, but refused to let his friend go near the village alone. They saw a little boy playing with a dog and the child ran into the village calling out \"American!\" Within seconds a villager appeared and they knelt down on the trail in supplication, but the man swung his machete and struck Martin in the leg. With the next swipe, Duane's head came off. Dengler jumped to his feet and rushed toward the villager, who turned and ran into the village to get help.\n\nI reached for the rubber sole from his foot, grabbed it and ran. From that moment on, all my motions became mechanical. I couldn't care less if I lived or died.\n\nDengler recalls, it was a wild animal who gave him the mental strength to continue.\n\n\"I was followed by this beautiful bear. He became like my pet dog and was the only friend I had.\"\n\nThese were his darkest hours. Little more than a walking skeleton after weeks on the run, he floated in and out of a hallucinatory state.\n\n\"I was just crawling along,\" he said. \"Then I had a vision: these enormous doors opened up. Lots of horses came galloping out. They were not driven by death, but by angels. Death didn't want me.\" \n\nDengler managed to evade the searchers who went out after him and escaped back into the jungle. He returned to the abandoned village where the two had been spending their time and where he and Martin had signaled the C-130. That night when a C-130 flare-ship came, Dengler set fire to the huts and burned the village down. The C-130 crew spotted the fires and dropped flares, but even though the crew reported their sighting when they returned to Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base, the fires were not recognized by intelligence as having been a signal from a survivor.\n\nWhen a rescue force again failed to materialize, Dengler decided to find one of the parachutes from a flare for use as a possible signal. He found one on a bush and placed it in his rucksack. On July 20, 1966, after 23 days in the jungle, Dengler managed to signal an Air Force pilot with the parachute. A 2-ship flight of Air Force Skyraiders from the 1st Air Commando Squadron happened to fly up the river where Dengler was. Eugene Peyton Deatrick, the pilot of the lead plane and the squadron commander, spotted a flash of white while making a turn at the river's bend and came back and spotted a man waving something white. Deatrick and his wingman contacted rescue forces, but were told to ignore the sighting, as no airmen were known to be down in the area. Deatrick persisted and eventually managed to convince the command and control center to dispatch a rescue force. Fearing that Dengler might be a Viet Cong soldier, the helicopter crew restrained him when he was brought aboard.\n\nAccording to the documentary, \"Little Dieter Needs to Fly\", Dengler said one of the flight crew who was holding him down pulled out a half eaten snake from underneath Dengler's clothing and was so surprised he nearly fell out of the helicopter. The person who threw Dengler to the floor of the helicopter was Air Force Pararescue specialist Michael Leonard from Lawler, Iowa. Leonard stripped Dengler of his clothes, making sure he was not armed or in possession of a hand grenade. When questioned, Dengler told Leonard that he was a Navy lieutenant JG who had escaped from a North Vietnamese prisoner of war camp two months earlier. Deatrick radioed the rescue helicopter crew to see if they could identify the person they had just hoisted up from the jungle. They reported that they had a man who claimed to be a downed Navy pilot who flew a Douglas A-1H Skyraider.\n\nIt wasn't until after he reached the hospital at Da Nang that Dengler's identity was confirmed. A conflict between the Air Force and the Navy developed over who should control his debriefing and recovery. In an apparent attempt to prevent the Air Force from embarrassing them in some way, the navy sent a team of SEALs into the hospital to literally steal Dengler. He was brought out of the hospital in a covered gurney and rushed to the air field, where he was placed aboard a navy carrier delivery transport Grumman C-2A from VR-21 and flown to the \"Ranger\" where a welcoming party had been prepared. At night, however, he was tormented by awful terrors, and had to be tied to his bed. In the end, his friends put him to sleep in a cockpit, surrounded by pillows. \"It was the only place I felt safe,\" he said.\n\nDengler's deprivation from malnutrition and parasites caused the Navy doctors to order that he be airlifted to the United States.\n\nDengler recovered physically, but never put his ordeal behind him. As Werner Herzog described it in his documentary about Dengler, \"Men are often haunted by things that happen to them in life, especially in war. Their lives come to be normal, but they are not.\"\n\nHe remained in the navy for a year, was promoted to Lieutenant, and was trained to fly jets. When his military obligation was satisfied, he resigned from the Navy and applied for a position as an airline pilot with Trans World Airlines. He continued flying and survived four subsequent crashes as a civilian test pilot.\n\nIn 1977, during a time when he was furloughed from Trans World Airlines, Dengler returned to Laos and was greeted as a celebrity by the Pathet Lao. He was taken to the camp from which he had escaped and was surprised to discover that at one point he and Martin had been within a mile and a half of it. His fascination with airplanes and aviation continued for the remainder of his life. He continued flying almost up until his death. He took advantage of an early-retirement offer as a pilot for TWA sometime prior to 1985, but continued flying his meticulously restored Cessna 195, putting it on static display at numerous California air shows. In 2000, Dengler was inducted into the Gathering of Eagles program and told the story of his escape to groups of young military officers. Dengler was diagnosed with ALS, an incurable neurological disorder; on February 7, 2001, he rolled his wheelchair from his house down to the driveway of a fire station and shot himself. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. A Navy honor guard was present at the burial as well as a fly-over by Navy F-14 Tomcats.\n\nDengler was married three times: to Marina Adamich (1966 – March 1970), to Irene Lam (September 11, 1980 – April 3, 1984) and to Yukiko Dengler (1998 until his death February 7, 2001). Dengler is also survived by two sons, Rolf and Alexander Dengler, and three grandsons, Tayden, Crixus and Corbin Dengler.\n\nDengler was the recipient of the following medals and decorations:\nDengler made an appearance as one of the contestants on the January 30, 1967 episode of the television game show \"I've Got a Secret\". His secret, as told to host Steve Allen, was that he had escaped from a POW camp in Laos. Dengler said that his weight had dropped to 93 pounds by the time he was rescued. During this appearance, both of Dengler's hands were bandaged in large casts. He explained that he had recently cut his tendons by accidentally falling through a sheet of plate glass.\n\nIn early 1968, Dengler was a contestant on the nighttime edition of the comedy game show \"Hollywood Squares\".\n\nDengler appears in the 1988 documentary \"We Can Keep You Forever\" about the POW/MIA issue generally. The documentary was written and directed by Christopher Olgiati. Gerry DeBruin, brother of Eugene DeBruin, is also interviewed. Information in the documentary appears at greater length in the 1990 book \"The Bamboo Cage: The Full Story of the American Servicemen Still Missing in Vietnam\" by Nigel Cawthorne.\n\nDengler was the subject of Werner Herzog's 1997 documentary \"Little Dieter Needs to Fly\". Herzog went on to direct a dramatized version of the story, \"Rescue Dawn\", which stars Christian Bale as Dengler. The film was shown at festivals throughout the end of 2006 and received a limited theatrical release in the USA on July 4, 2007, before the general release later that month. The film was released as a DVD in November 2007.\n\nThe movie \"Rescue Dawn\" was subjected to severe criticism by members of the family of Eugene DeBruin and Phisit Intharathat, the other survivor of the group.\n\nHerzog acknowledged that DeBruin acted heroically during his imprisonment, refusing to leave while some sick prisoners remained, but Herzog claimed to be unaware of this fact until after the film had been completed. Herzog states that this narrative aspect probably would have been included had he learned it earlier. DeBruin family members, however, said that Herzog was uninterested in speaking with them prior to the completion of the movie.\n\nDengler documented his experience in the book \"Escape From Laos\".\n\nBestselling author Bruce Henderson, who was serving on the same aircraft carrier as Dengler at the time he was shot down, tells Dengler's life story in a 2010 nonfiction book, \"\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "61193", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61193", "title": "Externality", "text": "Externality\n\nIn economics, an externality is the cost or benefit that affects a party who did not choose to incur that cost or benefit. When there is no externality, allocative efficiency is achieved; however, this rarely happens in the free market. . Economists often urge governments to adopt policies that will \"internalize\" an externality, so that costs and benefits will affect mainly parties who choose to incur them.\n\nFor example, manufacturing activities that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs on the whole society, whereas the neighbors of individuals who choose to fire-proof their homes may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of externalization is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than would be the case if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved. Thus, unregulated markets in goods or services with significant externalities generate prices that do not reflect the full social cost or benefit of their transactions; such markets are, therefore inefficient.\n\nTwo British economists are credited with having initiated the formal study of externalities, or \"spillover effects\": Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900) is credited with first articulating, and Arthur C. Pigou (1877–1959) is credited with formalizing the concept of externalities.\n\nA negative externality is any difference between the private cost of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social cost. In simple terms, a negative externality is anything that causes an indirect cost to individuals. An example is the toxic gases that are released from industries or mines, these gases cause harm to individuals within the surrounding area and have to bear a cost (indirect cost) to get rid of that harm. Conversely, a positive externality is any difference between the private benefit of an action or decision to an economic agent and the social benefit.\n\nSuppose that there are formula_1 different possible allocations and formula_2 different agents, where formula_3 and formula_4. Suppose that each agent has a type formula_5 and that each agent gets payoff formula_6, where formula_7 is the transfer paid by the formula_8-th agent. A map formula_9 is a \"social choice function\" if\n\nfor all formula_11 An allocation formula_12 is \"ex-post efficient\" if\n\nfor all formula_14 and all formula_15\n\nLet formula_16 denote an ex-post efficient allocation and let formula_17 denote an ex-post efficient allocation without agent formula_8. Then the \"externality\" imposed by agent formula_8 on the other agents is\n\nwhere formula_21 is the type vector formula_22 without its formula_8-th component. Intuitively, the first term is the hypothetical total payoff for all agents formula_24 given that agent formula_8 does not exist, and the second (subtracted) term is the actual total payoff for all agents formula_24 given that agent formula_8 does exist.\n\nVoluntary exchange is by definition mutually beneficial to both business parties involved because the parties would not agree to undertake it if either thought it detrimental to their interests. However, a transaction can cause effects on third parties without their knowledge or consent. From the perspective of those affected, these effects may be negative (pollution from a nearby factory), or positive (honey bees kept for honey that also pollinate neighboring crops). Neoclassical welfare economics asserts that, under plausible conditions, the existence of externalities will result in outcomes that are not socially optimal. Those who suffer from external costs do so involuntarily, whereas those who enjoy external benefits do so at no cost.\n\nA voluntary exchange may reduce societal welfare if external costs exist. The person who is affected by the negative externalities in the case of air pollution will see it as lowered utility: either subjective displeasure or potentially explicit costs, such as higher medical expenses. The externality may even be seen as a trespass on their lungs, violating their property rights. Thus, an external cost may pose an ethical or political problem. Negative externalities are Pareto inefficient, and since Pareto efficiency underpins the justification for private property, they undermine the whole idea of a market economy. For these reasons, negative externalities are more problematic than positive externalities.\n\nPositive externalities, while Pareto efficient, are still market failures that undermine allocative efficiency because less of the good will be produced than would be optimal for society as a whole in a theoretical model with no government. If those externalities were internalized, the producer would be incentivized to produce more. Goods with positive externalities include education (believed to increase societal productivity and well-being, though some benefits are internalized in the form of higher wages), public health initiatives (which may reduce the health risks and costs for third parties for such things as transmittable diseases) and law enforcement.\n\nPositive externalities are often associated with the free rider problem. For example, individuals who are vaccinated reduce the risk of contracting the relevant disease for all others around them, and at high levels of vaccination, society may receive large health and welfare benefits (herd immunity); but any one individual can refuse vaccination, still avoiding the disease by \"free riding\" on the costs borne by others.\n\nThere are a number of theoretical means of improving overall social utility when negative externalities are involved. The market-driven approach to correcting externalities is to \"internalize\" third party costs and benefits, for example, by requiring a polluter to repair any damage caused. But in many cases, internalizing costs or benefits is not feasible, especially if the true monetary values cannot be determined.\n\nLaissez-faire economists such as Friedrich Hayek and Milton Friedman sometimes refer to externalities as \"neighborhood effects\" or \"spillovers\", although externalities are not necessarily minor or localized. Similarly, Ludwig von Mises argues that externalities arise from lack of \"clear personal property definition.\"\n\nA negative externality (also called \"external cost\" or \"external diseconomy\") is an economic activity that imposes a negative effect on an unrelated third party. It can arise either during the production or the consumption of a good or service. Pollution is termed an externality because it imposes costs on people who are \"external\" to the producer and consumer of the polluting product. Barry Commoner commented on the costs of externalities:\nClearly, we have compiled a record of serious failures in recent technological encounters with the environment. In each case, the new technology was brought into use before the ultimate hazards were known. We have been quick to reap the benefits and slow to comprehend the costs.\nMany negative externalities are related to the environmental consequences of production and use. The article on environmental economics also addresses externalities and how they may be addressed in the context of environmental issues.\n\nExamples for negative production externalities include:\n\n\nExamples of negative consumption externalities include:\n\n\nA positive externality (also called \"external benefit\" or \"external economy\" or \"beneficial externality\") is the positive effect an activity imposes on an unrelated third party. Similar to a negative externality, it can arise either on the production side, or on the consumption side.\nExamples of positive production externalities include:\nExamples of positive consumption externalities include:\n\nThe existence or management of externalities may give rise to political or legal conflicts.\n\nCollective solutions or public policies are implemented to regulate activities with positive or negative externalities.\n\nA position externality \"occurs when new purchases alter the relevant context within which an existing positional good is evaluated.\" Robert H. Frank gives the following example:\n\nFrank notes that treating positional externalities like other externalities might lead to \"intrusive economic and social regulation.\" He argues, however, that less intrusive and more efficient means of \"limiting the costs of expenditure cascades\"—i.e., the hypothesized increase in spending of middle-income families beyond their means \"because of indirect effects associated with increased spending by top earners\"—exist; one such method is the personal income tax.\n\nInframarginal externalities are externalities in which there is no benefit or loss to the marginal consumer. In other words, people neither gain nor lose anything at the margin, but benefits and costs do exist for those consumers within the given inframarginal range.\n\nTechnological externalities directly affect a firm's production and therefore, indirectly influence an individual's consumption; and the overall impact of society.\n\nThe usual economic analysis of externalities can be illustrated using a standard supply and demand diagram if the externality can be valued in terms of money. An extra supply or demand curve is added, as in the diagrams below. One of the curves is the \"private cost\" that consumers pay as individuals for additional quantities of the good, which in competitive markets, is the marginal private cost. The other curve is the \"true\" cost that society as a whole pays for production and consumption of increased production the good, or the marginal social cost. Similarly, there might be two curves for the demand or benefit of the good. The social demand curve would reflect the benefit to society as a whole, while the normal demand curve reflects the benefit to consumers as individuals and is reflected as effective demand in the market.\n\nWhat curve is added depends on the type of externality that is described, but not whether it is positive or negative. Whenever an externality arises on the production side, there will be two supply curves (private and social cost). However, if the externality arises on the consumption side, there will be two demand curves instead (private and social benefit). This distinction is essential when it comes to resolving inefficiencies that are caused by externalities.\n\nThe graph shows the effects of a negative externality. For example, the steel industry is assumed to be selling in a competitive market – before pollution-control laws were imposed and enforced (e.g. under laissez-faire). The marginal private cost is less than the marginal social or public cost by the amount of the external cost, i.e., the cost of air pollution and water pollution. This is represented by the vertical distance between the two supply curves. It is assumed that there are no external benefits, so that social benefit \"equals\" individual benefit.\n\nIf the consumers only take into account their own private cost, they will end up at price P and quantity Q, instead of the more efficient price P and quantity Q. These latter reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased \"only\" as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a free market is \"inefficient\" since at the quantity Q, the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole would be better off if the goods between Q and Q had not been produced. The problem is that people are buying and consuming \"too much\" steel.\n\nThis discussion implies that negative externalities (such as pollution) are \"more than\" merely an ethical problem. The problem is one of the disjunctures between marginal private and social costs that are not solved by the free market. It is a problem of societal communication and coordination to balance costs and benefits. This also implies that pollution is not something solved by competitive markets. Some \"collective\" solution is needed, such as a court system to allow parties affected by the pollution to be compensated, government intervention banning or discouraging pollution, or economic incentives such as green taxes.\n\nThe graph shows the effects of a positive or beneficial externality. For example, the industry supplying smallpox vaccinations is assumed to be selling in a competitive market. The marginal private benefit of getting the vaccination is less than the marginal social or public benefit by the amount of the external benefit (for example, society as a whole is increasingly protected from smallpox by each vaccination, including those who refuse to participate). This marginal external benefit of getting a smallpox shot is represented by the vertical distance between the two demand curves. Assume there are no external costs, so that social cost \"equals\" individual cost.\n\nIf consumers only take into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price P and quantity Q as before, instead of the more efficient price P and quantity Q. This latter again reflect the idea that the marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an unfettered market is \"inefficient\" since at the quantity Q, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole would be better off if more goods had been produced. The problem is that people are buying \"too few\" vaccinations.\n\nThe issue of external benefits is related to that of public goods, which are goods where it is difficult if not impossible to exclude people from benefits. The production of a public good has beneficial externalities for all, or almost all, of the public. As with external costs, there is a problem here of societal communication and coordination to balance benefits and costs. This also implies that vaccination is not something solved by competitive markets. The government may have to step in with a collective solution, such as subsidizing or legally requiring vaccine use. If the government does this, the good is called a merit good. Examples include policies to accelerate the introduction of electric vehicles or promote cycling, both of which benefit public health.\n\nExternalities often arise from poorly defined property rights. While property rights to some things, such as objects, land, and money can be easily defined and protected, air, water, and wild animals often flow freely across personal and political borders, making it much more difficult to assign ownership. This incentivizes agents to consume them without paying the full cost, leading to negative externalities. Positive externalities similarly accrue from poorly defined property rights. For example, a person who gets a flu vaccination cannot own part of the herd immunity this confers on society, so they may choose not to be vaccinated.\n\n\nThere is no market solution that will internalize all externalities. Consequently, elements of the moral economy must be used, including social norms, law, leadership, and hierarchy. \"All of these structures are grounded in trust, which when supplemented with sanctions, can be used to generate complex institutional forms that can sustain outcomes that are not strategic equilibria.\"\n\nThere are several general types of solutions to the problem of externalities, including both public- and private-sector resolutions:\n\nA Pigovian tax (also called Pigouvian tax, after economist Arthur C. Pigou) is a tax imposed that is equal in value to the negative externality. The result is that the market outcome would be reduced to the efficient amount. A side effect is that revenue is raised for the government, reducing the amount of distortionary taxes that the government must impose elsewhere. Governments justify the use of Pigovian taxes saying that these taxes help the market reach an efficient outcome because this tax bridges the gap between marginal social costs and marginal private costs.\n\nSome arguments against Pigovian taxes say that the tax does not account for all the transfers and regulations involved with an externality. In other words, the tax only considers the amount of externality produced. Another argument against the tax is that it does not take private property into consideration. Under the Pigovian system, one firm, for example, can be taxed more than another firm, even though the other firm is actually producing greater amounts of the negative externality.\n\nHowever, the most common type of solution is a tacit agreement through the political process. Governments are elected to represent citizens and to strike political compromises between various interests. Normally governments pass laws and regulations to address pollution and other types of environmental harm. These laws and regulations can take the form of \"command and control\" regulation (such as setting standards, targets, or process requirements), or environmental pricing reform (such as ecotaxes or other Pigovian taxes, tradable pollution permits or the creation of markets for ecological services). The second type of resolution is a purely private agreement between the parties involved.\n\nGovernment intervention might not always be needed. Traditional ways of life may have evolved as ways to deal with external costs and benefits. Alternatively, democratically run communities can agree to deal with these costs and benefits in an amicable way. Externalities can sometimes be resolved by agreement between the parties involved. This resolution may even come about because of the threat of government action.\n\nThe private-sector may sometimes be able to drive society to the socially optimal resolution. Ronald Coase argued that an efficient outcome can sometimes be reached without government intervention. Some take this argument further, and make the political claim that government should restrict its role to facilitating bargaining among the affected groups or individuals and to enforcing any contracts that result.\n\nThis result, often known as the Coase theorem, requires that\nIf all of these conditions apply, the private parties can bargain to solve the problem of externalities. The second part of the Coase theorem asserts that, when these conditions hold, whoever holds the property rights, a Pareto efficient outcome will be reached through bargaining.\n\nThis theorem would not apply to the steel industry case discussed above. For example, with a steel factory that trespasses on the lungs of a large number of individuals with pollution, it is difficult if not impossible for any one person to negotiate with the producer, and there are large transaction costs. Hence the most common approach may be to regulate the firm (by imposing limits on the amount of pollution considered \"acceptable\") while paying for the regulation and enforcement with taxes. The case of the vaccinations would also not satisfy the requirements of the Coase theorem. Since the potential external beneficiaries of vaccination are the people themselves, the people would have to self-organize to pay each other to be vaccinated. But such an organization that involves the entire populace would be indistinguishable from government action.\n\nIn some cases, the Coase theorem is relevant. For example, if a logger is planning to clear-cut a forest in a way that has a negative impact on a nearby resort, the resort-owner and the logger could, in theory, get together to agree to a deal. For example, the resort-owner could pay the logger not to clear-cut – or could buy the forest. The most problematic situation, from Coase's perspective, occurs when the forest literally does not belong to anyone, or in any example in which there are not well-defined and enforceable property rights; the question of \"who\" owns the forest is not important, as any specific owner will have an interest in coming to an agreement with the resort owner (if such an agreement is mutually beneficial).\n\nHowever, the Coase theorem is difficult to implement because Coase does not offer a negotiation method. Moreover, Coasian solutions are unlikely to be reached due to the possibility of running into the assignment problem, the holdout problem, the free-rider problem, and/or transaction costs. Additionally, firms could potentially bribe each other since there is little to no government interaction under the Coase theorem. For example, if one oil firm has a high pollution rate and its neighboring firm is bothered by the pollution, then the latter firm may move depending on incentives. Thus, if the oil firm were to bribe the second firm, the first oil firm would suffer no negative consequences because the government would not know about the bribing.\n\nIn a dynamic setup, Rosenkranz and Schmitz (2007) have shown that the impossibility to rule out Coasean bargaining tomorrow may actually justify Pigouvian intervention today. To see this, note that unrestrained bargaining in the future may lead to an underinvestment problem (the so-called hold-up problem). Specifically, when investments are relationship-specific and non-contractible, then insufficient investments will be made when it is anticipated that parts of the investments’ returns will go to the trading partner in future negotiations (see Hart and Moore, 1988). Hence, Pigouvian taxation can be welfare-improving precisely because Coasean bargaining will take place in the future. Antràs and Staiger (2012) make a related point in the context of international trade.\n\nEcological economics criticizes the concept of externality because there is not enough system thinking and integration of different sciences in the concept.\nEcological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually cancelling \"externalities\" is not warranted. Joan Martinez Alier, for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet. The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by Fred Pearce and by the recent Stern Report (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as Clive Spash).\n\nConcerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman Paul Hawken argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations. These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in \"\".\n\nIn contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning. Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by Karl William Kapp explains why the concept of \"externality\" is a misnomer. In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits. Charles Eisenstein has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive As social ecological economist Clive Spash has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system. Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.This is precisely why heterodox economists argue for a heterodox theory of social costs to effectively prevent the problem through the precautionary principle.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24950599", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24950599", "title": "Free Culture Forum", "text": "Free Culture Forum\n\nThe Free Culture Forum (FCForum) is an international encounter of civic society actors on free culture, digital rights and access to knowledge. It has been taking place in Barcelona every year since 2009. It takes place jointly with the oXcars, a free culture festival.\n\nThe FCForum is a major international meeting of the most relevant organisations and individuals working on the international scene, who are engaged in reflecting on the social and economic challenges of the dissemination of culture and knowledge in the digital age.\n\nThe main objectives of the Free Culture Forum 2009 (from October 30 to November 1) were, on the one hand, building networks to optimise the efforts of the different groups and setting common demands against the proposals from industry and governments in their eagerness to control culture and information; and on the other hand reinforcing the self-organisation of tools and infrastructures to support free culture. The first edition of the Forum was organised by eXgae (now Xnet), Simona Levi, Mayo Fuster Morell, Networked politics and the Free Knowledge Institute. The FCForum 2009 produced the Charter for Innovation, Creativity and Access to Knowledge. The Charter has been disseminated and implemented worldwide, including the 26th Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin and the Free Culture X Conference.\n\nOfficial observers from the European Community's Commission for Culture and Education (Valerie Panis), the European Community's Commission for Consumer Protection (Katrine Thomsen) and Government of Brazil (through its José Murillo from its Department of Digital Culture ) were present.\n\nThe working program was focused on five working lines: \n\n\nThe second FCForum was held in Barcelona from October 28 to 31, 2010 and focused on economical models. It was organised by Xnet, Simona Levi, Mayo Fuster Morell and Yproductions, with the advise of Felix Stalder. It resulted in a Declaration and How to Manual on sustainability of creativity in the digital era. The FCForum declaration was signed by 80 organisations and individuals, including Richard Stallman.\n\nParticipants in the FCForum split into working groups focusing on the following topics:\n\nIn February 2011, two documents drafted by FCForum participants were released: \"Sustainable Models for Creativity\" and the \"How-To Manual for Sustainable creativity\", addressed at political reformers, citizens and free culture activists. Both documents are based on an understanding that current royalties management and cultural distribution systems have become obsolete in the digital age, and the conviction that free software and peer production and distribution is not incompatible with market strategies and commercial distribution. The How-To Manual sets out a series of alternative commercial and non-profit models. It insists that the Internet must remain free and open in order to allow online collaboration models to develop, and it must be recognised as a tool that promotes contact between creators and the public. The manual offers an overview of new models that are already operating in a variety of fields, such as freemium, crowdfunding and micropayment systems in which users make small financial contributions to projects that are looking for seed funding through platforms such as Kickstarter and lanzanos.com or to existing initiatives that are given money depending on the number of users who vote for them (such as Flattr, created by Peter Sunde and Linus Olsson). It also claims that the creators of commercial cooperative platforms should share their profits with the creators of the content they publish.\n\nThe third annual FCForum was held in Barcelona on October 28, 29 and 30, under the title ‘Networks for a R-evolution’.\n\nDay one revolved around sustainable models for creativity in the digital age. It included a round table on the current situation of film and the Internet in Spain, with Álex de la Iglesia, Juan Carlos Tous, Amparo Peiró, Eudald Doménech and the lawyer Josep Jover. This was followed by a session in which Yproducciones, Kayros Transmedia, Daniel Granados, Kolector, Flattr, Goteo and Verkami explored some new sustainable alternatives for the creative sec\ntor.\n\nDay two focused on challenges and tools for the defence of the Internet and of sharing in the framework of the digital revolution. Participants included the lawyer David Bravo, La Quadrature du Net, John Perry Barlow and Richard Stallman.\n\nThe fourth FCForum was held at Ars Santa Mònica on October 26 and 27.\n\nDay one explored the theme of sustainable models for the creative sector, with practical examples from the fields of journalism, education (Freeangle) and publishing (Bookcamping). The report on crowdfunding \"Crowdfunding Experiences in Spain and Catalonia: Key Characteristics, Challenges and Obstacles. Inspiration and Recommendations for a Stronger Tool for Collective, Public and Private Cross-Financing” was presented by its authors.\n\nOne of the main sections looked at how cyber crime is being used as an excuse to criminalize and control the Internet, with an introduction by the lawyer Carlos Sánchez Almeida and presentations of projects such as Tor Project and Telecomix.\n\nDay two focused on democracy in the digital age, with debates on transparency in public institutions (Cuentas Claras, Discursia, Sueldos Públicos, Graba to Pleno, Qué hacen los diputados, Open Knowledge Foundation, Access Info, Tu Derecho a Saber and Civio), journalism and freedom of information, and networked democracy.\n\nThe 2012 FCForum also worked on a system for the collaborative reform of Intellectual Property legislation in Spain and the European Union, using documents linked to the FCForum and the proposal prepared by Quadrature du Net as a point of departure.\n\nThe 2012 FCForum team also participated in the book \"Cultura libre digital - Nociones básicas para defender lo que es de todxs\", which was published by Editorial Icaria in 2012.\n\nThe FCForum 2013 took place on October 25 and revolved around four core \nthemes: Creativity, Culture and Knowledge: New models of access and \nproduction; Data Science: The potential and limits of Big Data; Networked Democracy; and Electronic Money and Distributed Currency: Strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe sixth edition of the FCForum was itinerant; it took place in different spaces and dates.\n\nThe Barcelona Growth Center hosted on November 4 an all-day meeting on Networked Democracy and Technopolitics where eight participants with experience in these fields explained both dimensions and the practices \nin technopolitics and democracy. These participants were: Joan Subirats, professor at the Universidad Autónoma de Barcelona; Simona Levi, founder of Xnet; Ismael Peña-López, teacher at the UOC; Víctor Sampedro, teacher at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; Antonio Ruíz, from Appgree; Sergio Salgado, member of 15MpaRato and the X Party; Javier Toret; Miguel Arana, member of the Laboratorio Democrático and Francesca Bria, head of the European project D-CENT.20.\n\nOn November 5, 6 and 7, at the BAU Design College of Barcelona, several workshops on design tools took place as well as lectures divided in five blocks:\nThe participants in this edition were designers, artists, associations and cultural collectives like: Anne Laforet, Femke Snelting, Josianito Llorente, En torno a la silla, Exando una Mano, Ana Isabel Carvalho and Ricardo Lafuente (Manufactura Independente), OSP, Raúl Nieves (Faboratory), Tomas Diez (FabLabBcn), LaCol, Zuloark or Makea Tu Vida.\n\nOn November 27, 28 and 29, at the Barcelona's Center of Contemporary Culture, \"The Influencers\" took place; a festival about non conventional art, communication guerrilla and radical entertainment.\n\nUnder the title \"Fighters & Makers\", the seventh edition of the FCForum took place on October 30 and 31 and November 2, 2015, in different spaces in Barcelona.\n\nOn October 30, Sala Conservas held a series of working groups that came together round the following topics:\n\n- Legislation on copyright and intellectual property. Net Neutrality.\n\nWith the participation of Diego Naranjo and Maryant Fernández-Pérez (European Digital Rights), Till Kreutzer (An Initiative Against Ancillary Copyright - IGEL), Gaelle Krikorian (advisor on access to Knowledge and Intellectual Property), Estelle Massé (Access), Thomas Lohninger (Netzfreiheit), Rejo Zenger (Bits of Freedom) and Jérémie Zimmermann (La Quadrature du Net).\n\n- Freedom of expression, freedom of information\n\nWith the participation of James Love (Knowledge Ecology International ), Jeremy Malcolm (Electronic Frontier Foundation ), Renata Ávila (human rights and intellectual property lawyer, advisor of Wikileaks, the Courage Foundation, Creative Commons and member of the Web We Want), Diego Naranjo and Maryant Fernández-Pérez (European Digital Rights) and Ali Nikouei (Baaroo Foundation).\n\nOn October 31, the FCForum moved to the Farinera del Clot cultural centre, opening with a press conference for journalists and attendees to introduce the \"Citizen Group against Corruption\"; a state platform of citizen groups actively working against corruption, formed by Simona Levi and Sergio Salgado, from XnetLeaks and 15MpaRato; Audita Sanidad, a collective working on a citizen debt audit of the health care sector; Ana Garrido, one of the first plaintiffs if the corruption case Gürtel; Kontuz, a citizen association of users, consumers and taxpayers that has uncovered major corruption cases in Navarra; Acción Cívica; Encarnacion Cortés, councillor who denounced corruption in the town of Benalmádena; David Fernàndez, former president of the Parliamentary Commission on the 'Pujol Case' as deputy of the CUP-Parlament; Fernando Urruticoechea, who has reported several cases of corruption from the public administration and Patricia Ramirez Suarez, activist in defence of banking abuses and founder and president of ASUFIN.\n\nOther participants as advisors were the Citizen Debt Audit Platform - PACD; Pau A. Monserrat, economist author of \"La banca culpable\" (The Guilty Banks) and Raul Burillo, tax inspector who led the team of inspectors which investigated cases such as 'Palma Arena', 'Son Oms' or 'Maquillaje'.\n\nThe day continued with two blocks of conferences and a new working group.\n\nThe lectures focused on the \"crisis\" as a \"scam\" and on surveillance, repression, data protection and civil liberties. The first batch of interventions had activist Enric Duran (Faircoop & CIC), the Finsalud Foundation and the journalist and lawyer Hibai Arbide, social movements expert. The second block had Jeremie Zimmermann, James Love, Jeremy Malcolm, Renata Ávila and EDRi, as well as Arjen Kamphuis (Centre for Investigative Journalism) and Alberto Escorcia (LoQueSigue TV).\n\nThe working group \"Freedom of expression, freedom of information, freedom of action: state of affairs and coordination of struggles in the Spanish State\" analysed the so-called \"gag law\" and the \"Torquemada law\" with the participation of LegalSol, Rights International Spain and the lawyer Carlos Almeida.\n\nThe day ended with a series of workshops on digital self-defence and the right to privacy of communications, such as the right to information and freedom of expression as well as a specific workshop for journalists conducted by the Centre for Investigative Journalism.\n\nNovember 2 was the last day of the seventh edition of the Free Culture Forum, dedicated to \"Makers & business models\" and held at the BAU Design College of Barcelona.\n\nParticipants:Ateneus of Digital Manufacture, BAU Lab, Ehcofab - Fabmóvil, \nCompanyia, Defko Ak Ñiëp, Kër Thiossane, collective Malahembra and Josef Prusa (Reprap developer).\n\nThe day ended with a show conference held by ZEMOS98.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "356950", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=356950", "title": "Human Be-In", "text": "Human Be-In\n\nThe Human Be-In was an event in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park Polo Fields on January 14, 1967. It was a prelude to San Francisco's Summer of Love, which made the Haight-Ashbury district a symbol of American counterculture and introduced the word \"psychedelic\" to suburbia.\n\nThe Human Be-In focused the key ideas of the 1960s counterculture: personal empowerment, cultural and political decentralization, communal living, ecological awareness, higher consciousness (with the aid of psychedelic drugs), acceptance of illicit psychedelics use, and radical liberal political consciousness. The hippie movement developed out of disaffected student communities around San Francisco State University, City College and Berkeley and in San Francisco's beat generation poets and jazz hipsters, who also combined a search for intuitive spontaneity with a rejection of \"middle-class morality\". Allen Ginsberg personified the transition between the beat and hippie generations.\n\nThe Human Be-In took its name from a chance remark by the artist Michael Bowen made at the Love Pageant Rally. The playful name combined humanist values with the scores of sit-ins that had been reforming college and university practices and eroding the vestiges of entrenched segregation, starting with the lunch counter sit-ins of 1960 in Greensboro, North Carolina, and Nashville, Tennessee. The first major teach-in had been organized by Students for a Democratic Society at the University of Michigan, 24–25 March 1965.\n\nThe Human Be-In was announced on the cover of the fifth issue of the \"San Francisco Oracle\" as \"A Gathering of the Tribes for a Human Be-In\". The occasion was a new California law banning the use of the psychedelic drug LSD that had come into effect on October 6, 1966. The speakers at the rally were all invited by Bowen, the main organizer. They included Timothy Leary in his first San Francisco appearance, who set the tone that afternoon with his famous phrase \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" and Richard Alpert (soon to be known as \"Ram Dass\"), and poets like Allen Ginsberg, who chanted mantras, Gary Snyder and Michael McClure. Other counterculture gurus included comedian Dick Gregory, Lenore Kandel, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Jerry Rubin, and Alan Watts. The Hells Angels, at the peak of their \"outlaw\" reputation, corralled lost children. Music was provided by a host of local rock bands including Jefferson Airplane, The Grateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Quicksilver Messenger Service, and Blue Cheer most of whom had been staples of the Fillmore and the Avalon Ballroom. \"Underground chemist\" Owsley Stanley provided massive amounts of his \"White Lightning\" LSD, specially produced for the event, as well as 75 twenty-pound turkeys, for free distribution by the Diggers.\n\nThe national media were stunned, publicity about this event leading to the mass movement of young people from all over America to descend on the Haight-Ashbury area. Reports were unable to agree whether 20,000 or 30,000 people showed up at the Be-In. Soon every gathering was an \"-In\" of some kind: Just 4 weeks later was Bob Fass's Human Fly-In, then the Emmett Grogan inspired Sweep-In, Rowan and Martin's \"Laugh-In\" comedy television show began airing over NBC just a year later on January 22, 1968. This was followed by the first \"Yip-In\" (March 21, 1968, at Grand Central Terminal), \"Love-In\" (April 14, 1968, at Malibu Canyon) and \"Bed-In\" (March 25, 1969, in Amsterdam).\n\nThe Human Be-In was later recalled by poet Allen Cohen (who assisted the artist Bowen in the organizational work,) as a meld that brought together philosophically opposed factions of the San Francisco-based counterculture at the time: on one side, the Berkeley radicals, who were tending toward increased militancy in response to the U.S. government's Vietnam war policies, and, on the other side, the rather non-political Haight-Ashbury hippies, who urged peaceful protest. Their means were drastically different, but they held many of the same goals.\n\nAccording to Cohen's own account, his friend Bowen provided much of the \"organizing energy\" for the event, and Bowen's personal connections also strongly influenced its character.\n\nThe counterculture that surfaced at the \"Human Be-In\" encouraged people to \"question authority\" with regard to civil rights, women's rights, and consumer rights. Underground newspapers and radio stations served as its alternative media.\n\nThe Be-In later spawned a series of Digital Be-Ins.\n\nA UK theatre company, Theatre 14167, (also 14167 films) takes its name from the date of the Be-In; the company subsequently produced work by Michael McClure, who read at the event.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "57423907", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57423907", "title": "John Chilembwe's motivation", "text": "John Chilembwe's motivation\n\nThe ideas, people and events that constituted John Chilembwe's motivation and influenced him to undertake an uprising in 1915 were considered by the Commission of Inquiry shortly after the rising was defeated and have exercised historians of Malawi for the last 60 years. Whether the dominant ideas were political, social, economic or religious and how these combined is unclear because Chilembwe did not leave a detailed record of the reasons for his armed revolt. As he was an ordained Baptist minister, much attention has focussed on his religious ideas, whether orthodox or related to millennialism, the extent to which they existed, particularly in the period shortly before the rising, the part that such beliefs played in the decision to revolt and the course of the uprising.\n\nAlthough there is reasonable evidence that, in the first decade after his return to Nyasaland at least, Chilembwe aimed at the social and economic advancement of Africans through education and the adoption of useful knowledge, following the ideas of Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Du Bois, there is little direct evidence of his ultimate political aims, his theological beliefs or what he preached, particularly in the first dozen years of his ministry. This may be because, as his surviving correspondence shows, he had little interest in discussing theology; in addition, he declined to follow Joseph Booth in his sabbatarianism, he had no known direct links to the Watch Tower Society and is not known to have introduced any doctrinal innovations. Unlike Booth, who was notorious for his radicalism and promotion of fundamentalist and promoting Ethiopianism or Elliot Kamwana, whose preaching was openly millennial and considered as anti-colonial, both of whom were unpopular with the colonial authorities and most European missionaries, and were both deported for expressing radical political views, up to 1914 at least, Chilembwe's work at the Providence Industrial Mission favourably impressed European officials and missionaries.\n\nUndoubtedly millenarian uprisings did exist, such as that leading to Bulhoek massacre, where there was no doubt that the participants, a religious group led by Enoch Mgijima with no political agenda, believed that the world would soon end and mounted frontal attacks on armed troops and police. However, Cobbing, writing about an earlier colonial revolt, cautioned about pursuing the \"false trail of millenarianism\" where unbearable political, social and economic pressures were sufficient causes for an attempt to drive out European colonisers, where there is no need to suggest other, less evident, causes and where the evidence for millenarianism is speculative or ambiguous. Chilembwe received an orthodox Baptist theological training in the US and he never joined any other denomination. He used biblical language in his correspondence, as may be expected from a Baptist minister, but (unlike Booth's and Kamwana's) his known writings were not unambiguously millenarian. As far as is known, Chilembwe held standard Baptist views, rejected the Saturday observance favoured by Booth, and stated that he had no connection with the Watchtower movement.\nSeveral historians consider that the Chilembwe uprising was planned, although perhaps without sufficient care, at several clandestine meetings before any action was taken, that Chilembwe acquired a textbook on military tactics, and that the authorities received advance warnings of the intended uprising several months before it took place. Another source claims that little or no preparation was made for the revolt, because the authorities discovered none from monitoring Chilembwe's correspondence, although it adds that he knew his mail was being monitored. \n\nIf Chilembwe made a detailed record of the reasons why he, an educated and respected clergyman, conspired with like-minded Africans to carry out an armed revolt against the Nyasaland government, that record has been lost, and he and most of his chief collaborators were killed or fled immediately after it and were not interrogated. A number of possible reasons have been proposed: some are supported by direct contemporary evidence, others depend on later sources or are more speculative. Chilembwe was apparently willing to work within the framework of the colonial system until 1912, although from 1909 his aim of improving the conditions of Africans, particularly labour tenants on European estates awakened a consciousness that might be considered nationalistic, and there were signs of alienation from European administrators and landowners. There is good evidence that, as early as 1908 he had incurred debts and by 1914 was being pressed for payment while suffering from a reduction in support from the National Baptist Convention in the United States. He was also suffering from asthma and failing eyesight.\nFrom 1911, Chilembwe became increasingly concerned with the situation of Mozambican immigrants, many of whom were members of his church that worked on European-owned estates, particularly the A L Bruce Estates property at Magomero. These workers suffered from an increase in hut tax in 1912 and from famine in 1913. He and other mission-educated African \"new men\", some of whom became Chilembwe's lieutenants in the rising, were angered by the refusal of the settlers and government to accept their worth or provide them with suitable opportunities or a political voice. Finally, the African casualties in the East African campaign, both soldiers and porters, deeply affected him, and government demands for more porters had a direct impact on his Providence Industrial Mission members.\nThe colonial authorities sought first to contain, then to explain the revolt. It was contained by executing most of the African planters of Chiradzulu District and many of the Bruce Estate's foremen (or capitãos), both groups being seen as potential leaders. In April 1915, soon after the rebellion, the Nyasaland government set-up a Commission of Inquiry to report on the origins, causes and objectives of the \"Native rising in the Shire Highlands\". It consisted of three colonial administrators, a senior Anglican missionary, and a representative of the European estate owners, and its terms of reference included examining alleged grievances that may have influenced the rising and the effects of mission teaching.\nThe Commission's report suggested that the main objective of the rising was to exterminate or expel Europeans and set up of an African state or theocracy with John Chilembwe at its head. It put most of the blame on Chilembwe's political and religious teaching and the mainly immigrant congregation of his mission at Mbombwe, although it accepted that working conditions on some estates were often unsatisfactory The Commission criticised the Scottish-run churches, especially the Church of Scotland's Blantyre Mission, which had educated had many of Chilembwe's principal followers, for treating African church members as equals. It also considered that the independent African churches and Church of Christ and Seventh-Day Baptist missions, which it lumped together as \"Watchtower\", had promoted racial animosity by preaching racial equality and should be subject to strict government control.\n\nThe first comprehensive biography of John Chilembwe by Shepperson and Price considered that the causes of his uprising went back many years rather than being triggered only by events shortly before it took place. They regarded Chilembwe as an early nationalist, looking forward to the creation of a nation, rather than to re-establishing traditional leaders. Chilembwe did not reject European education and civilisation but believed that Africans should share the benefits of Western technology and culture that the Europeans in Nyasaland monopolised.

Lloyd\n\nJohn Minchin Lloyd (1835 — December 18, 1892) was a bricklayer and police officer in Washington, D.C., in the United States. He was one of the first police officers hired by the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia when its Day Watch was first formed in 1855. He played a role in the trial of the conspirators in the Abraham Lincoln assassination. Arrested but never charged in the conspiracy, Lloyd's testimony was critical in convicting Mary Surratt.\n\nJohn Minchin Lloyd's date of birth is not clear, but two sources have him born in 1835 in southern Maryland in the United States to William Lloyd. He was the oldest of two sons. By 1850, 14-year-old John and his father had moved into Washington, D.C. He probably had little schooling, and instead apprenticed as a bricklayer. By 1855, John Lloyd was working full-time as a bricklayer, and living at 506 8th Street NW.\n\nThe City of Washington had organized a night constabulary in October 1804, but after members of the Whig Party rioted in the city in 1842 and nearly assaulted President John Tyler, a new police force was organized. In March 1851, the police force was reorganized into a day watch, night watch, and auxiliary. John M. Lloyd was appointed one of new police officers, at a yearly salary of $480 ($ in dollars). It is not clear when Lloyd joined the force or what duties he was assigned, for he does not appear in the list of officers assigned to wards in 1851. But in 1855, records show that Lloyd was assigned to the 7th Police District, and his pay was raised to $576 a year ($ in dollars). His pay rose to $630 a year ($ in dollars) in 1858.\n\nThe District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department was organized by Congress in August 1861, replacing the police forces of the City of Washington, Georgetown, and the District of Columbia (that portion of the District outside the City of Washington's city limits). For reasons that are not clear, Lloyd left the Metropolitan Police Department in 1862. His profession upon leaving the police force is also unknown. It is well understood, however, that Lloyd was openly sympathetic to the cause of the Confederate States of America. The American Civil War broke out in April 1862, 1861and Lloyd may have left the force due to his political views.\n\nLloyd moved out of the District of Columbia after resigning from the police force, and into Prince George's County. He later told Mary Surratt that he spent time running a tavern there. In December 1864, Lloyd moved to the bustling village of Surrattsville. Mary Surratt, a widow and Confederate sympathizer, owned a tavern, inn, carriage house, corn crib, forge, general store, granary, gristmill, stable, tobacco curing house, wheelwright's shop in the center of town, and of nearby farmland. In the fall of 1864, she began considering moving to her townhouse in the city. Surratt leased her tavern to Lloyd on December 1 for $500 a year, and moved into town the same day.\n\nMrs. Surratt lived in her townhouse with her daughter, Anna, and son, John. Over the next five months, she rented rooms to a number of people, including Louis J. Weichmann, George Atzerodt, and Lewis Powell. These three men, John Surratt, and John Wilkes Booth subsequently conspired to kidnap President Abraham Lincoln in March 1865. When that plot failed, they decided to assassinate the president instead. Lincoln was fatally shot at Ford's Theatre on the evening of April 14, 1865.\n\nAs part of the plot to kidnap Lincoln in March 1865, John Surratt, Atzerodt, and conspirator David Herold hid two Spencer carbines, ammunition, and some other supplies at the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville. On April 11, Mary Surratt rented a carriage and drove to the Surrattsville tavern to collect (she later said) a debt owed her by a former neighbor. But according to Lloyd, Surratt told him to get the \"shooting irons\" ready to be picked up. Worried that the inn might be searched by federal troops, Lloyd was concerned about the weapons left in his possession. Later that day, he asked George Atzerodt what to do with them, and was told to bury them.\n\nOn April 14, Surratt once again visited the family tavern in Surrattsville on April 14 (the day of the assassination) to collect a debt. Shortly before she left the city, Booth visited the Surratt boarding house and spoke privately with Mrs. Surratt. He gave her a package (later found to contain binoculars) to give to Lloyd. Surratt delivered the package, and (according to Lloyd) again told Lloyd to have the \"shooting irons\" ready for pick-up and handed him a wrapped package from Booth. (Booth and Herold picked up the rifles and binoculars that evening as they fled Washington after Lincoln's assassination.) Lloyd repaired a broken spring on Mrs. Surratt's wagon before she left.\n\nFederal investigators immediately identified Booth and his co-conspirators, and believed they had headed south into Maryland and then Virginia in an attempt to escape. Nodley Anderson, an innkeeper in the hamlet of Piscataway, Maryland, notified them that the Surratt tavern in Surrattsville was a notorious meeting place for Confederate spies, and that Lloyd may know something about the assassination. When questioned, Lloyd initially denied knowing Booth or Herold, and had seen neither man the night of the assassination. He was questioned a second time by D.C. police, and repeated his claims. After the police left, he fled the tavern and went to the home of his wife's relatives in the hamlet of Allens Fresh, Charles County, Maryland. But local Surrattsville residents told investigators that Lloyd did indeed know Booth and some of the other conspirators, and with Mrs. Surratt having been arrested on April 17, federal troops finally went in pursuit of Lloyd. Lloyd had already decided to return to Surrattsville to avoid suspicion, and was arrested on the road there on April 18, 1865.\n\nJohn Lloyd was interrogated at a makeshift headquarters in Robey's post office in Surrattsville on April 18, 19, and 20. His interrogators included Captain George Cottingham, U.S. Army, several other U.S. Army officers, and several D.C police detectives. Whether Lloyd was tortured in order to obtain his testimony is highly contested by published sources. Several sources claim Lloyd was an alcoholic, and was denied liquor in order to take advantage of his illness and make him talk. Some sources claim Lloyd was hung by his thumbs until he agreed to testify against Mrs. Surratt. Higdon says Lloyd was merely threatened with hanging by his thumbs, but not tortured. But most sources claim that Lloyd was merely intensively interrogated without the use of torture or deprivation of alcohol. Larson argues that the interrogation merely consisted of \"several days of back-and-forth questioning, stalling, intimidation, and obfuscation, manipulating Lloyd and wearing him down in the hopes of extracting a confession.\" Cottingham revealed that Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton had called for the death penalty for the conspirators. Cottingham played off Lloyd's fears that his family might also be arrested or tried, and that the military would seek to put him to death unless he confessed. Lloyd told Cottingham that he feared being murdered by the other conspirators, but by April 22 Cottingham had wrung a full confession from Lloyd.\n\nLloyd informed his interrogators that John Surratt, Atzerodt, and Herold had hidden a pair of carbines, ammunition, some rope, and a wrench in a wall on the second floor. He admitted that Mrs. Surratt had reminded him of their existence on April 11 and April 14. He also revealed that Booth and Herold had visited the tavern near midnight on April 14, taking one of the guns as well as the field glasses and some whiskey. Booth, Lloyd said, bragged that he had killed Lincoln. Lloyd helped the investigators recover the second gun, which confirmed his testimony. Seeing his wife at the tavern, Lloyd cried, \"Oh, Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman, she has ruined me! I am to be shot!\"\n\nLloyd was transferred to the Union Army's headquarters at Bryantown, Maryland, where he was further interrogated by Colonel Henry H. Wells. He revealed more details of the conspiracy, and of Booth and Herold's visit on April 14. Portions of his testimony tended to implicate John and Mary Surratt, George Atzertodt, and David Herold in the assassination plot.\n\nLloyd was transferred to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., on April 23. He was questioned further there.\n\nAlthough John Lloyd was imprisoned for some weeks, he was never charged with any crimes and was eventually released. The reason was his testimony: The law at the time did not permit prosecutors to try a witness for conspiracy if he testified against his co-conspirators. Secretary of War Stanton and military prosecutors understood that Lloyd would go free, but they would win the conviction of Surratt and the others in the process.\n\nThe prosecution presented nine witnesses against Mrs. Surratt, but most of their case rested on the testimony of just two men—John Lloyd and Surratt boarding house tenant Louis Weichmann.\n\nLloyd testified on May 13 and 15, 1865, regarding the hiding of the carbines and other supplies at the tavern in March, and the two conversations he had with Mrs. Surratt in which she told him to get the \"shooting irons\" ready. The defense called Captain Cottingham, and unintentionally damaged its case. Cottingham testified that Lloyd feared that the conspirators would kill him. When asked who Cottingham believed the conspirators to be, he mentioned Lloyd's outburst about \"Mrs. Surratt, that vile woman\" and said he had concluded that Lloyd meant Mrs. Surratt was one of the conspirators. Lloyd's testimony had been the most important for the prosecution's case, for it indicated Mary Surratt played an active role in the conspiracy in the days just before Lincoln's death.\n\nThe defense strategy was to impeach Lloyd's testimony. Several witnesses impugned Lloyd's character by testifying about his alcoholism. Several eyewitnesses said he appeared completely intoxicated on the day of Lincoln's death (April 14), implying that he could not have remembered with clarity what happened that day. Surratt's chief attorney, Reverdy Johnson, asserted repeatedly that Lloyd was an unreliable witness, and that the evidence against Mary Surratt was entirely circumstantial. The only evidence linking Surratt to the conspiracy to kill Lincoln, he said, came from Lloyd and Weichmann, and neither man was telling the truth (he said). Lloyd's testimony was coerced, he claimed. The government's case was hindered by its failure to call as a witness the man who shared Lloyd's carriage when he talked with Mrs. Surratt (an individual who could have verified Lloyd's version of the \"shooting irons\" story).\n\nThe nine-member military tribunal hearing the case sentenced Mary Surratt, George Atzerodt, David Herold, and Lewis Powell to death on July 5, 1865. As their crimes had occurred in an area under military jurisdiction, the Habeas Corpus Suspension Act denied them any appeal. The four were hanged at the Washington Arsenal on July 7, 1865.\n\nIn October 1865, Lloyd moved back to the District of Columbia from Surrattsville.\n\nFor the rest of his life, Lloyd worked as a bricklayer and construction contractor in Washington, D.C. He was severely injured in early December 1892 when, while helping to construct a building, the scaffold he was standing on collapsed. He died on December 18. A Roman Catholic, Lloyd was buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery. Mary Surratt's grave is about away from Lloyd's.\n\nThe 21-year-old John married 20-year-old Mary Elizabeth Mahorney (sometimes spelled Mahoney) of Virginia in 1857. They had several children, but all died of smallpox at a young age and none survived him.\n\n"}

The uprising was sparked by the laying-off of hundreds of Bahraini workers at the Bahrain Petroleum Company on March 5, 1965. Several people died in the sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police.\n\nThe uprising started when students of Manama High School, which then was the only high school in Bahrain, protested against the laying-off of hundreds of workers at BAPCO (Bahrain Petroleum Company), however, the protest was quickly suppressed by the infantry. The news of the crackdown created a nationwide uprising which would last for a month.\n\nThe uprising's motto was \"Down down colonialism\" (Arabic: يسقط يسقط الاستعمار)\n\nMuharraq was a strong center of protests.

{"id": "85709", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85709", "title": "Nortia", "text": "Nortia\n\nNortia is the Latinized name of the Etruscan goddess Nurtia (variant manuscript readings include \"Norcia\", \"Norsia\", \"Nercia\", and \"Nyrtia\"), whose sphere of influence was time, fate, destiny, and chance.\n\nLittle or no Etruscan evidence for Nortia survives. Her name is not among those of the deities on the Liver of Piacenza. She appears a few times in Latin literature and inscriptions. She is mentioned in one of Juvenal's satires and identified with the Roman goddess Fortuna, and Martianus Capella lists her along with other goddesses of fate and chance such as Sors, Nemesis, and Tyche. Tertullian names Nortia twice in Christian polemic.\n\nA name has been deciphered as possibly Nortia among those of other deities in an inscription found within an Umbrian sanctuary at the Villa Fidelia, Hispellum. The 4th-century writer and consul Avienus, who was from Nortia's seat in Volsinii, addressed the goddess in a devotional inscription:\n\nNortia, I venerate you, I who sprang from a Volsinian \"lar\", living now at Rome, boosted by the honor of a doubled term as proconsul, crafting many poems, leading a guilt-free life, sound for my age, happy with my marriage to Placida and jubilant about our serial fecundity in offspring. May the spirit be vital for those things which, as arranged by the law of the fates, remain to be carried out.\n\nThe ancient location of Volsinii is vexed, and the Etruscan town was refounded by the Romans. At Bolsena, the most likely candidate for the new Volsinii, there is a ruin outside the Florence gate that is known locally as the \"Tempio di Norzia\", but as George Dennis pointed out in the 19th century, no evidence other than the existence of the cult of Nortia supports this identification, and the architecture is Roman.\n\nNortia's attribute was a nail, which was driven into a wall within her temple at Volsinii annually to mark the New Year. The Roman historian Livy took note of the ritual:\nCincius, an industrious researcher of antiquarian matters, confirms that at Volsinii nails are in evidence at the temple of the Etruscan goddess Nortia, fixed to mark the number of years.\nThe ritual seems to \"nail down\" the fate of the people for the year. Cicero refers to a form of timekeeping in which the nail of the year is to be moved \"(clavum anni movebis)\". In context, the reference is probably to \"parapegmata\", calendars in which the day is marked by the moving of a peg. Some extant Roman calendars in stone or metal have holes for this purpose.\n\nH.S. Versnel conjectured that the ritual of the nail was associated with the annual meeting of the Etruscan league, and that Nortia's consort could have been Voltumna, the counterpart of Roman Vortumnus. The rite is analogous to, or a borrowed precedent for, a similar ritual at Rome originally held in the Temple of Capitoline Jupiter, near a statue of Minerva. Nortia may thus have been related to the Etruscan Menerva. At Rome, the goddess Necessitas, the divine personification of necessity, was also depicted with a nail, \"the adamantine nail / That grim Necessity drives,\" as described by the Augustan poet Horace. In a poem addressing Fortuna and acknowledging her power over all, from the lowliest to the highest, Horace pictures Necessity carrying nails large enough to drive into wooden beams, and wedges.\n\nThe ritual of the nail illuminates the otherwise puzzling iconography on the back of an Etruscan bronze mirror. Meleager is depicted under the wings of another Etruscan goddess of fate, identified by inscription as \"Athrpa\", the counterpart of the Greek fate goddess Atropos who is one of the three Moirai. Athrpa holds a hammer in her right hand and a nail in her left. With Meleager is his beloved Atalanta (both names given in the Etruscan spelling), who will be parted by his death in a boar hunt presaged at the top of the composition. Turan and Atunis (the Etruscan Venus and Adonis myth) also appear, as another couple whose love is destroyed by the savagery of the hunt. The hammer ready to drive in the nail symbolizes \"the inexorability of human fate.\"\n\nR.S. Conway compared Nortia to the Venetic goddess Rehtia, whose name seems to be the Venetic equivalent of Latin \"rectia\", \"right, correct.\" Bronze nails finely inscribed with dedications were found within a temple precinct thought to have been that of Rehtia at Ateste (modern Este). The heads of the nails have links that attach them to small objects or charms, perhaps the \"wedges of necessity\" that Horace said Fortuna carried. Rehtia has been seen as a counterpart of the Roman Iustitia, the divine embodiment of justice, or the Greek goddesses Themis or Dikē.\n\n"}

Fallout may get entrained with the products of a pyrocumulus cloud and fall as black rain (rain darkened by soot and other particulates).\n\nThis radioactive dust, usually consisting of fission products mixed with bystanding atoms that are neutron activated by exposure, is a highly dangerous kind of radioactive contamination.\n\nAn air burst (that is, a nuclear detonation far above the surface) can produce fallout across whole regions, countries or worldwide, but the longer it travels, the weaker it becomes. A ground burst can produce much more severe, local fallout.\n\nAfter an air burst, fission products, un-fissioned nuclear material, and weapon residues vaporized by the heat of the fireball condense into a fine suspension of small particles 10 nm to 20 µm in diameter. These particles may be quickly drawn up into the stratosphere, particularly if the explosive yield exceeds 10 kt.\n\nInitially little was known about the dispersion of nuclear fallout on a global scale. The AEC assumed that fallout would be dispersed evenly across the globe by atmospheric winds and gradually settle to the Earth's surface after weeks, months, and even years as worldwide fallout.\n\nThe radio-biological hazard of worldwide fallout is a long-term one because of the potential accumulation of long-lived radioisotopes (such as strontium-90 and caesium-137) in the body as a result of ingestion of foods containing the radioactive materials. Because they are dispersed, levels of these isotopes are small for individual nuclear events. Local fallout is more concentrated and of far more immediate concern.\n\nIn a land or water surface burst, heat vaporizes large amounts of earth or water, which is drawn up into the radioactive cloud. This material becomes radioactive when it condenses with fission products and other radiocontaminants that have become neutron-activated. The table below summarizes the abilities of common isotopes to form fallout. Some radiation taints large amounts of land and drinking water causing formal mutations throughout animal and human life.\n\nA surface burst generates large amounts of particulate matter, composed of particles from less than 100 nm to several millimeters in diameter—in addition to very fine particles that contribute to worldwide fallout. The larger particles spill out of the stem and cascade down the outside of the fireball in a downdraft even as the cloud rises, so fallout begins to arrive near ground zero within an hour. More than half the total bomb debris lands on the ground within about 24 hours as local fallout. Chemical properties of the elements in the fallout control the rate at which they are deposited on the ground. Less volatile elements deposit first.\n\nSevere local fallout contamination can extend far beyond the blast and thermal effects, particularly in the case of high yield surface detonations. The ground track of fallout from an explosion depends on the weather from the time of detonation onwards. In stronger winds, fallout travels faster but takes the same time to descend, so although it covers a larger path, it is more spread out or diluted. Thus, the width of the fallout pattern for any given dose rate is reduced where the downwind distance is increased by higher winds. The total amount of activity deposited up to any given time is the same irrespective of the wind pattern, so overall casualty figures from fallout are generally independent of winds. But thunderstorms can bring down activity as rain more rapidly than dry fallout, particularly if the mushroom cloud is low enough to be below (\"washout\"), or mixed with (\"rainout\"), the thunderstorm.\n\nWhenever individuals remain in a radiologically contaminated area, such contamination leads to an immediate external radiation exposure as well as a possible later internal hazard from inhalation and ingestion of radiocontaminants, such as the rather short-lived iodine-131, which is accumulated in the thyroid.\n\nThere are two main considerations for the location of an explosion: height and surface composition. A nuclear weapon detonated in the air, called an air burst, produces less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground.\n\nIn case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions that chemically bond to many surfaces. Water and detergent washing effectively removes less than 50% of this chemically bonded activity from concrete or steel. Complete decontamination requires aggressive treatment like sandblasting, or acidic treatment. After the \"Crossroads\" underwater test, it was found that wet fallout must be immediately removed from ships by continuous water washdown (such as from the fire sprinkler system on the decks).\n\nParts of the sea bottom may become fallout. After the Castle Bravo test, white dust—contaminated calcium oxide particles originating from pulverized and calcined corals—fell for several hours, causing beta burns and radiation exposure to the inhabitants of the nearby atolls and the crew of the \"Daigo Fukuryū Maru\" fishing boat. The scientists called the fallout \"Bikini snow\".\n\nFor subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called \"base surge\". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.\n\nFor subsurface land bursts, the surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a fluid. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger radiation doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much radioactive decay has occurred.\n\nMeteorological conditions greatly influence fallout, particularly local fallout. Atmospheric winds are able to bring fallout over large areas. For example, as a result of a \"Castle Bravo\" surface burst of a 15 Mt thermonuclear device at Bikini Atoll on March 1, 1954, a roughly cigar-shaped area of the Pacific extending over 500 km downwind and varying in width to a maximum of 100 km was severely contaminated. There are three very different versions of the fallout pattern from this test, because the fallout was only measured on a small number of widely spaced Pacific Atolls. The two alternative versions both ascribe the high radiation levels at north Rongelap to a downwind hotspot caused by the large amount of radioactivity carried on fallout particles of about 50-100 micrometres size.\n\nAfter \"Bravo\", it was discovered that fallout landing on the ocean disperses in the top water layer (above the thermocline at 100 m depth), and the land equivalent dose rate can be calculated by multiplying the ocean dose rate at two days after burst by a factor of about 530. In other 1954 tests, including \"Yankee\" and \"Nectar,\" hotspots were mapped out by ships with submersible probes, and similar hotspots occurred in 1956 tests such as \"Zuni\" and \"Tewa\".\n\nSnow and rain, especially if they come from considerable heights, accelerate local fallout. Under special meteorological conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.\n\nA wide range of biological changes may follow the irradiation of animals. These vary from rapid death following high doses of penetrating whole-body radiation, to essentially normal lives for a variable period of time until the development of delayed radiation effects, in a portion of the exposed population, following low dose exposures.\n\nThe unit of actual \"exposure\" is the röntgen, defined in ionisations per unit volume of air. All ionisation based instruments (including geiger counters and ionisation chambers) measure exposure. However, effects depend on the energy per unit mass, not the exposure measured in air. A deposit of 1 joule per kilogram has the unit of 1 gray (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 röntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue. Because of shielding by the tissue surrounding the bones, the bone marrow only receives about 0.67 cGy when the air exposure is 1 röntgen and the surface skin dose is 1 cGy. Some lower values reported for the amount of radiation that would kill 50% of personnel (the ) refer to bone marrow dose, which is only 67% of the air dose.\n\nThe dose that would be lethal to 50% of a population is a common parameter used to compare the effects of various fallout types or circumstances. Usually, the term is defined for a specific time, and limited to studies of acute lethality. The common time periods used are 30 days or less for most small laboratory animals and to 60 days for large animals and humans. The LD figure assumes that the individuals did not receive other injuries or medical treatment.\n\nIn the 1950s, the LD for gamma rays was set at 3.5 Gy, while under more dire conditions of war (a bad diet, little medical care, poor nursing) the LD was 2.5 Gy (250 rad). There have been few documented cases of survival beyond 6 Gy. One person at Chernobyl survived a dose of more than 10 Gy, but many of the persons exposed there were not uniformly exposed over their entire body. If a person is exposed in a non-homogeneous manner then a given dose (averaged over the entire body) is less likely to be lethal. For instance, if a person gets a hand/low arm dose of 100 Gy, which gives them an overall dose of 4 Gy, they are more likely to survive than a person who gets a 4 Gy dose over their entire body. A hand dose of 10 Gy or more would likely result in loss of the hand. A British industrial radiographer who was estimated to have received a hand dose of 100 Gy over the course of his lifetime lost his hand because of radiation dermatitis. Most people become ill after an exposure to 1 Gy or more. The fetuses of pregnant women are often more vulnerable to radiation and may miscarry, especially in the first trimester.\n\nOne hour after a surface burst, the radiation from fallout in the crater region is 30 grays per hour (Gy/h). Civilian dose rates in peacetime range from 30 to 100 µGy per year.\n\nFallout radiation decays relatively quickly with time. Most areas become fairly safe for travel and decontamination after three to five weeks.\n\nFor yields of up to 10 kt, prompt radiation is the dominant producer of casualties on the battlefield. Humans receiving an acute incapacitating dose (30 Gy) have their performance degraded almost immediately and become ineffective within several hours. However, they do not die until five to six days after exposure, assuming they do not receive any other injuries. Individuals receiving less than a total of 1.5 Gy are not incapacitated. People receiving doses greater than 1.5 Gy become disabled, and some eventually die.\n\nA dose of 5.3 Gy to 8.3 Gy is considered lethal but not immediately incapacitating. Personnel exposed to this amount of radiation have their cognitive performance degraded in two to three hours, depending on how physically demanding the tasks they must perform are, and remain in this disabled state at least two days. However, at that point they experience a recovery period and can perform non-demanding tasks for about six days, after which they relapse for about four weeks. At this time they begin exhibiting symptoms of radiation poisoning of sufficient severity to render them totally ineffective. Death follows at approximately six weeks after exposure, although outcomes may vary.\n\nLate or delayed effects of radiation occur following a wide range of doses and dose rates. Delayed effects may appear months to years after irradiation and include a wide variety of effects involving almost all tissues or organs. Some of the \"possible\" delayed consequences of radiation injury, with the rates above the background prevalence, depending on the absorbed dose, include carcinogenesis, cataract formation, chronic radiodermatitis, decreased fertility, and genetic mutations.\n\nPresently, the only teratological effect observed in humans following nuclear attacks on highly populated areas is microcephaly which is the only proven malformation, or congenital abnormality, found in the in utero developing human fetuses present during the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings. Of all the pregnant women who were close enough to be exposed to the \"prompt\" burst of intense neutron and gamma doses in the two cities, the total number of children born with microcephaly was below 50. No statistically demonstrable increase of congenital malformations was found among the \"later conceived children\" born to survivors of the nuclear detonations at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The surviving women of Hiroshima and Nagasaki who could conceive and were exposed to substantial amounts of radiation went on and had children with no higher incidence of abnormalities than the Japanese average.\n\nThe Baby Tooth Survey founded by the husband and wife team of physicians Eric Reiss and Louise Reiss, was a research effort focused on detecting the presence of strontium-90, a cancer-causing radioactive isotope created by the more than 400 atomic tests conducted above ground that is absorbed from water and dairy products into the bones and teeth given its chemical similarity to calcium. The team sent collection forms to schools in the St. Louis, Missouri area, hoping to gather 50,000 teeth each year. Ultimately, the project collected over 300,000 teeth from children of various ages before the project was ended in 1970.\n\nPreliminary results of the Baby Tooth Survey were published in the November 24, 1961, edition of the journal \"Science\", and showed that levels of strontium 90 had risen steadily in children born in the 1950s, with those born later showing the most pronounced increases. The results of a more comprehensive study of the elements found in the teeth collected showed that children born after 1963 had levels of strontium 90 in their baby teeth that was 50 times higher than that found in children born before large-scale atomic testing began. The findings helped convince U.S. President John F. Kennedy to sign the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the United Kingdom and Soviet Union, which ended the above-ground nuclear weapons testing that created the greatest amounts of atmospheric nuclear fallout.\n\nThe baby tooth survey was a \"campaign [that] effectively employed a variety of media advocacy strategies\" to alarm the public and \"galvanized\" support against atmospheric nuclear testing, with putting an end to such testing being commonly viewed as a positive outcome for a myriad of other reasons. The survey could not show then at the time, nor in the decades that have elapsed, that the levels of global strontium-90 or fallout in general, were in any way life-threatening, primarily because \"50 times the strontium-90 from \"before\" nuclear testing\" is a minuscule number, and multiplication of minuscule numbers results in only a slightly larger minuscule number. Moreover, the Radiation and Public Health Project which currently retains the teeth has had their stance and publications heavily criticized: A 2003 article in \"The New York Times\" states that the group's work has been controversial and has little credibility with the scientific establishment. Similarly, in an April 2014 article in \"Popular Science\", Sarah Fecht explains that the group's work, specifically the widely discussed case of cherry-picking data to suggest that fallout from the 2011 Fukushima accident caused infant deaths in America, is \"junk science\", as despite their papers being peer-reviewed, all independent attempts to corroborate their results return findings that are not in agreement with what the organization suggests. The organization had earlier also tried to suggest the same thing occurred after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident but this was likewise exposed to be without merit. The tooth survey, and the expansion of the organization into attempting the same test-ban approach with US nuclear electric power stations as the new target, is likewise detailed and critically labelled as the \"Tooth Fairy issue\" by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\nDuring the Cold War, the governments of the U.S., the USSR, Great Britain, and China attempted to educate their citizens about surviving a nuclear attack by providing procedures on minimizing short-term exposure to fallout. This effort commonly became known as Civil Defense.\n\nFallout protection is almost exclusively concerned with protection from radiation. Radiation from a fallout is encountered in the forms of alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, and as ordinary clothing affords protection from alpha and beta radiation, most fallout protection measures deal with reducing exposure to gamma radiation. For the purposes of radiation shielding, many materials have a characteristic \"halving thickness\": the thickness of a layer of a material sufficient to reduce gamma radiation exposure by 50%. Halving thicknesses of common materials include: 1 cm (0.4 inch) of lead, 6 cm (2.4 inches) of concrete, 9 cm (3.6 inches) of packed earth or 150 m (500 ft) of air. When multiple thicknesses are built, the shielding is additive. A practical fallout shield is ten halving-thicknesses of a given material, such as 90 cm (36 inches) of packed earth, which reduces gamma ray exposure by approximately 1024 times (2). A shelter built with these materials for the purposes of fallout protection is known as a fallout shelter.\n\nAs the nuclear energy sector continues to grow, the international rhetoric surrounding nuclear warfare intensifies, and the ever-present threat of radioactive materials falling into the hands of dangerous people persists, many scientists are working hard to find the best way to protect human organs from the harmful effects of high energy radiation. Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS) is the most immediate risk to humans when exposed to ionizing radiation in dosages greater than around 0.1 Gy/hr. Radiation in the low energy spectrum (alpha and beta radiation) with minimal penetrating power are unlikely to cause significant damage to internal organs. The high penetrating power of gamma and neutron radiation, however, easily penetrates the skin and many thin shielding mechanisms to cause cellular degeneration in the stem cells found in bone marrow. While full body shielding in a secure fallout shelter as described above is the most optimal form of radiation protection, it requires being locked in a very thick bunker for a significant amount of time. In the event of a nuclear catastrophe of any kind, it is imperative to have mobile protection equipment for medical and security personnel to perform necessary containment, evacuation, and any number of other important public safety objectives. The mass of the shielding material required to properly protect the entire body from high energy radiation would make functional movement essentially impossible. This has led scientists to begin researching the idea of partial body protection: a strategy inspired by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The idea is to use enough shielding material to sufficiently protect the high concentration of bone marrow in the pelvic region, which contains enough regenerative stem cells to repopulate the body with unaffected bone marrow. More information on bone marrow shielding can be found in the Health Physics Radiation Safety Journal article Selective Shielding of Bone Marrow: An Approach to Protecting Humans from External Gamma Radiation, or in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA)'s 2015 report: Occupational Radiation Protection in Severe Accident Management.\n\nThe danger of radiation from fallout also decreases with time, as radioactivity decays exponentially with time, such that for each factor of seven increase in time, the radiation is reduced by a factor of ten. For example, after 7 hours, the average dose rate is reduced by a factor of ten; after 49 hours, it is reduced by a further factor of ten (to 1/100th); after two weeks the radiation from the fallout will have reduced by a factor of 1000 compared the initial level; and after 14 weeks the average dose rate will have reduced to 1/10,000th of the initial level.\n\nFallout can also refer to nuclear accidents, although a nuclear reactor does not explode like a nuclear weapon. The isotopic signature of bomb fallout is very different from the fallout from a serious power reactor accident (such as Chernobyl or Fukushima).\n\nThe key differences are in volatility and half-life.\n\nThe boiling point of an element (or its compounds) is able to control the percentage of that element a power reactor accident releases. The ability of an element to form a solid controls the rate it is deposited on the ground after having been injected into the atmosphere by a nuclear detonation or accident.\n\nA half life is the time it takes half of the radiation of a specific substance to decay. A large amount of short-lived isotopes such as Zr are present in bomb fallout. This isotope and other short-lived isotopes are constantly generated in a power reactor, but because the criticality occurs over a long length of time, the majority of these short lived isotopes decay before they can be released.\n\n\n"}

The building has had different names over the years, and was put to many different uses. It was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake and partially demolished in September 2012. The theatre was recognised as a Category I heritage building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust, with registration number 3140. One of its most notable aspects was its use as a public meeting venue of Kate Sheppard during her women's suffrage campaign.\n\nA syndicate of citizens formed the Public Hall Company Ltd and through this commissioned the building. The theatre, located in 214 Tuam Street, was built in 1883 to a design by Thomas Stoddart Lambert (1840–1915). It had a capacity of 2,200 people, 600 of whom fitted into the gallery. The stage was initially wide and deep. The building was opened on 20 July 1883, with the Mayor of Christchurch, George Ruddenklau, presiding.\nThe building's original name was Tuam Street Hall or Tuam Street Theatre. The building had a variety of rather diverse uses: public meeting place, entertainment, exhibitions, roller skate rink, and other activities. In 1893, it was used by Kate Sheppard for women's suffrage. After the 1893 Electoral Act was passed on 19 September 1893, which meant that New Zealand women were the first in the world to be granted the right to vote, an enrolment meeting was held by Sheppard at Tuam Street Hall on 26 September in preparation for the 1893 election in late November. Despite rather unfavourable weather, 600 women were enrolled that day.\n\nIn 1894, the name changed to Opera House. Vaudeville was the main form of entertainment around the turn of the century, and John Fuller's son Benjamin started their theatre company's involvement with the building in 1903.\n\nSidney Luttrell was commissioned to remodel the building's interior, and the modified space opened on 26 December 1927, providing seating for 1,300 people. The dimensions of the stage were changed to wide, deep, and high, and there were then 19 dressing rooms. With the introduction of film in 1930, the name was once again changed, this time to St James. The stage remained, though, and the building was sometimes used for other purposes, for example live entertainment. St James closed for a period during the Great Depression. Notable performers during the 1940s include the Trapp Family Singers, Stanley Holloway, Johnny Devlin, Laurence Olivier, and Olivier's second wife Vivien Leigh.\nOwnership changed in 1960 to Kerridge-Odeon Ltd, and the building was renamed Odeon and reopened on 27 September 1960. Extensive changes were undertaken, including the removal of the parapet, reduction of seating down to 720, updating of the cinema equipment, and introduction of a coffee lounge. Through competition with television, patronage declined and the theatre eventually closed. The building was purchased in 1983 by the Sydenham Assembly of God, who used it for religious gatherings from 1985.\n\nThe building was bought in 2003 by a group of businessmen, who in May 2004 applied for demolition consent. In response, the Odeon Theatre Trust was formed by residents concerned for the preservation of the building. Ownership changed again in December 2006, when Property Ventures Ltd, the development company of David Henderson, purchased it. Property Ventures had its office in a building diagonally opposite the Odeon Theatre at 179 Tuam Street. When Henderson's companies got into financial difficulties, Christchurch City Council controversially bought five of his inner city land holdings in August 2008, but not the Odeon Theatre. Henderson was placed in bankruptcy in November 2010.\nDuring the years of the Sydenham Assembly of God ownership, a large yellow illuminated cross was displayed on the theatre's frontage (the bracket still visible in photos post-2008). Henderson used the cross in the SOL Square development (located on the north side of the Property Ventures head office) and styled one of the bars as the Yellow Cross, prominently displaying the cross on the roof apex.\n\nIn 2009, Christchurch actor and director Mark Hadlow campaigned for the Odeon Theatre to be turned into an arts complex for an estimated NZ$60m.\n\nOn 26 November 1981, the building was registered by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust as a Category I historic place, with the registration number 3140. The building is recognised as the once largest public meeting venue in Christchurch, the oldest remaining theatre in Christchurch, and the then country's oldest masonry theatre. Of significance is the use of the building by Kate Sheppard. Another aspect is the building's association with two important Christchurch designers, Lambert and S. Luttrell.\n\nThe building was severely damaged in the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. Demolition was ordered by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in January 2012. In September of that year, the rear of the building was demolished. The front of the building is protected by a stack of shipping containers placed in Tuam Street; it is hoped to retain at least the façade of the building, but its future is uncertain; this is still the case as of September 2017.\n"}

{"id": "31621514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31621514", "title": "Ritz Theater (Newburgh, New York)", "text": "Ritz Theater (Newburgh, New York)\n\nThe Ritz Theater is located in the city of Newburgh, New York. The theater is the last remaining historic theater in the city. The legendary building has a rich history of notable performances, and is being restored by a local nonprofit organization.\n\nThe original structure that would become the home of the Ritz Theater was constructed in 1883 at 107 Broadway in Newburgh, New York. “The address had been the site of other ventures that offered some of life’s small luxuries: George Barnes’ plumbing business ... a cigar factory ... and even a champagne factory.”\n\nIn 1913, the intended manufacturing building was purchased by George Cohen, “a Poughkeepsie entrepreneur,” and was named Cohen’s Opera House. The opera house opened on February 4, 1913. The opera house welcomed performers of all arts: jugglers, singers, dance troupes, theater companies, etc.\n\nThe East-West Theater Company became a part of the theater and changed the theater’s name from Cohen’s Opera House to the State Theater in 1926. The State Theater was a major participant in the vaudeville theatrical genre that was extremely popular at the time.\n\nIn 1933 Eugene Levy purchased the theater from George Cohen and “converted that playhouse of a gaudier era into an institution where cinematic and variety productions of the highest standard [were] presented with amazing skill, and affording the fascinated beholder the ultimate in comfort and convenience.” This would begin a new era for the Ritz Theater, which became a frequent stomping ground of many big name stars such as: Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Prima, Mary Martin, Peggy Lee, Wood Herman, Dick Powell, Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, Eddy Duchin, Red Skelton, Xavier Cugat, The Inkspots, Vaughn Monroe, Montana Slim, Les Brown, Ricardo Crotez, and many more.\n\nOn November 3, 1940, Frank Sinatra, an unknown singer at the time, stepped onto the Ritz Theater’s stage. The band of Tommy Dorsey backed Sinatra who captivated the Newburgh audience.\n\nThe Ritz Theater is most notably famous for being the stage where Lucille Ball made her stage debut. “On December 17th, 1941 she performed for the first time on stage and for the first time with her new husband, Desi Arnaz. It was on the Ritz stage that they planted the seeds for their sitcom, \"I Love Lucy\".”\n\nShows were brought to the Ritz Theater by New York City’s Paramount Theater to test their acts on the Newburgh audience before opening in New York City.\n\nAlthough the Ritz Theater continued to show movies, in the 1960s both the City of Newburgh and its once highly popular street of Broadway entered a slow decline that affected the theater as well as the city. The popular city of Newburgh was no longer as frequented as it once was as the ferry closed, and I-84 as well as the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge by-passed the downtown area of Newburgh.\n\nIn October 1969, the Ritz Theater was closed, and the theater became a movie house containing two cinemas. Cinemas one and two were carved into the house and the stage was closed and walled off from the rest of the structure. In 1981 both of the cinemas were shut down after “vandals damaged $15,000 worth of seating improvements inside the theater” and the owner of cinemas One and Two, Abram and Eva Levinson, “quit Newburgh ... quietly closing up shop.”\n\nIn February 1999, the movie theater was reopened by a former owner; however, the theater was quickly closed again for good in June of the same year due to lack of business. Throughout this span of seventeen weeks in business, the theater only had 700 customers.\n\nIn 2002, the Ritz Theater was purchased by Patricia Haggerty-Wenz, Founder and Executive Director of Safe Harbors of the Hudson, which is a “nonprofit organization that is committed to transforming lives and building communities through housing and the arts in the City of Newburgh.” The organization stumbled upon the theater in the process of restoring the adjacent former Hotel Newburgh, which is now the Cornerstone Residence, a supportive-housing facility. Haggerty-Wenz's mission for the only remaining historic theater in the City of Newburgh, is to “provide a venue for live performances in a city that has none, educational programs for our youth, employment opportunities for our community and to create an active cultural and tourist destination.”\n\nThis combination project, according to Haggerty-Wenz, is “the only one in the country that combines the restoration of a historic theater with a supportive housing project, all under one roof.”\n\nWith Haggerty-Wenz and Safe Harbors of the Hudson being the new owner of the establishment, the renovation of the Ritz Theater Lobby began. The renovation of the supportive housing project called the Cornerstone Residence adjacent to the theater occurred from 2004-2006.\n\nThe Cornerstone Residence consists of 128 apartments; 116 are supportive housing units and twelve are artist lofts. The apartments house a mixed tenancy of single adults, including formerly homeless, veterans, those living with a mental health diagnosis and/or physical disability, artists and other adults who need safe, attractive affordable housing.\n\nIn 2008, Safe Harbors of the Hudson created a nonprofit organization called Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. The mission of this particular nonprofit organization was to focus exclusively on the restoration of the Ritz Theater. A new era bloomed within the theater. It began hosting live performances in the newly restored lobby from award-winning musicians such as: Levi Kreiss, Pete Seeger and Odair Assad. The performances were part of the Tom Humphrey Guitar series.\n\nIn 2009, Ritz Theater-Newburgh, Inc. continued providing programming and performances in the restored lobby from artists such as: Bucky Pizzarelli, Arturo O’Farrill, The Michele Ramo Group, Jesse Lege, and many others. As well as providing performances in the lobby, the organization also focused on raising funds to restore the original theater to what it was. In July of the same year, Congressman Maurice Hinchey secured a federal appropriations bill which included “400,000 to begin renovating the Ritz Theater, the last remaining historic theater in Newburgh.”\n\nIn 2010, the Tom Humphrey Guitar Series continued to perform featuring artists such as: Larry Coryell, Maria Zemantauski and Duke Robillard. In October and November, Cindy Cashdollar and Frederic Hand performed and the second annual RitzKidz “Newburgh’s Got Talent” Talent Show was held. In February of the same year, the Ritz Theater secured 200,000 dollars in funding from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal’s Urban Initiatives Program. This funding was directed towards the building of a box office.\n\nThe completion of the reconstruction of the Ritz Theater is scheduled for 2014. After the theater is finished, it will hold 825 people. There are a few nonprofit performing arts organizations who hope to make the newly renovated Ritz Theater their home; such as: “The Greater Newburgh Symphony Orchestra, the Opera Company of the Highlands and the Newburgh Performing Arts Academy” (Ritz Theater Tour).\n"}

In 1956 it was acquired by and remains the home of the English Stage Company and is notable for its contributions to contemporary theatre.\n\nThe first theatre on Lower George Street, off Sloane Square, was the converted Nonconformist Ranelagh Chapel, opened as a theatre in 1870 under the name The New Chelsea Theatre. Marie Litton became its manager in 1871, hiring Walter Emden to remodel the interior, and it was renamed the Court Theatre.\nSeveral of W. S. Gilbert's early plays were staged here, including \"Randall's Thumb\", \"Creatures of Impulse\" (with music by Alberto Randegger), \"Great Expectations\" (adapted from the Dickens novel), and \"On Guard\" (all in 1871); \"The Happy Land\" (1873, with Gilbert Abbott à Beckett; Gilbert's most controversial play); \"The Wedding March\", translated from \"Un Chapeau de Paille d'Italie\" by Eugène Marin Labiche (1873); \"The Blue-Legged Lady\", translated from \"La Dame aux Jambes d'Azur\" by Labiche and Marc-Michel (1874); and \"Broken Hearts\" (1875). By 1878, management of the theatre was shared by John Hare and W. H. Kendal.\n\nFurther alterations were made in 1882 by Alexander Peebles, after which its capacity was 728 (including stalls and boxes, dress circle and balcony, amphitheatre, and gallery). After that, Arthur Cecil (who had joined the theatre's company in 1881) was co-manager of the theatre with John Clayton. Among other works, they produced a series of Arthur Wing Pinero's farces, including \"The Rector\", \"The Magistrate\" (1885), \"The Schoolmistress\" (1886), and \"Dandy Dick\" (1887), among others. The theatre closed on 22 July 1887 and was demolished.\n\nThe present building was built on the east side of Sloane Square, replacing the earlier building, and opened on 24 September 1888 as the New Court Theatre. Designed by Walter Emden and Bertie Crewe, it is constructed of fine red brick, moulded brick, and a stone facade in free Italianate style. Originally the theatre had a capacity of 841 in the stalls, dress circle, amphitheatre, and a gallery.\n\nCecil and Clayton yielded management of the theatre to Mrs. John Wood and Arthur Chudleigh in 1887, although Cecil continued acting in their company (and others) until 1895. The first production in the new building was a play by Sydney Grundy titled \"Mamma\", starring Mrs. John Wood and John Hare, with Arthur Cecil and Eric Lewis. By the end of the century, the theatre was again called the \"Royal Court Theatre\".\n\nHarley Granville-Barker managed the theatre for the first few years of the 20th century, and George Bernard Shaw's plays were produced at the New Court for a period. It ceased to be used as a theatre in 1932, but was used as a cinema from 1935 to 1940, until World War II bomb damage closed it.\n\nThe interior was reconstructed by Robert Cromie, and the number of seats was reduced to under 500. The theatre re-opened in 1952. George Devine was appointed artistic director at the suggestion of Oscar Lewenstein, one of the founders of the English Stage Company. Greville Poke, another co-founder was appointed Honorary Secretary of the ESC in October 1954. The ESC opened at the Royal Court in 1956 as a subsidised theatre producing new British and foreign plays, together with some classical revivals. Devine aimed to create a writers' theatre, seeking to discover new writers and produce serious contemporary works. Devine produced the new company's third production in 1956, John Osborne's \"Look Back in Anger\", a play by one of the angry young men. The director was Tony Richardson. Osborne followed \"Look Back In Anger\" with \"The Entertainer\", with Laurence Olivier in the lead as Archie Rice, a play the actor effectively commissioned from the playwright. Significantly, although it was quickly reversed, the artistic board of the ESC initially rejected the play. Two members of the board were in agreement in opposing \"The Entertainer\". The Conservative Christian verse dramatist Ronald Duncan, the third co-founder of the ESC, disliked the work of Osborne according to Osborne biographer John Heilpern, while Lewenstein, a former Communist, did not want one of the theatre's new plays to be overwhelmed by its star and did not think much of the play.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the ESC became involved in issues of censorship. Their premiere productions of Osborne's \"A Patriot for Me\" and \"Saved\" by Edward Bond (both 1965) necessitated the theatre turning itself into a 'private members club' to circumvent the Lord Chamberlain, formally responsible for the licensing of plays until the Theatres Act 1968. The \"succès de scandale\" of the two plays helped to bring about the abolition of theatre censorship in the UK. During the period of Devine's directorship, besides Osborne and Bond, the Royal Court premiered works by Arnold Wesker, John Arden, Ann Jellicoe and N.F. Simpson. Subsequent Artistic Directors of the Royal Court premiered work by Christopher Hampton, Athol Fugard, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill, Hanif Kureishi, Sarah Daniels, Errol John, Timberlake Wertenbaker, Martin Crimp, Sarah Kane, Sylvia Wynter, Mark Ravenhill, Martin McDonagh, Simon Stephens, Leo Butler, Polly Stenham and Nick Payne. Early seasons included new international plays by Bertolt Brecht, Eugène Ionesco, Samuel Beckett, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Marguerite Duras. In addition to the 400-seat proscenium arch Theatre Downstairs, the much smaller studio Theatre Upstairs was opened in 1969, at the time a 63-seat facility. \"The Rocky Horror Show\" premiered there in 1973. The theatre was Grade II listed in June 1972.\n\nThough the main auditorium and the façade were attractive, the remainder of the building provided poor facilities for both audience and performers, and the stalls and understage often flooded throughout the 20th century. By the early 1990s, the theatre had deteriorated dangerously and was threatened with closure in 1995. The Royal Court received a grant of £16.2 million from the National Lottery and the Arts Council for redevelopment, and beginning in 1996, under the artistic directorship of Stephen Daldry, it was completely rebuilt, except for the façade and the intimate auditorium. The architects for this were Haworth Tompkins. The theatre reopened in February 2000, with the 380-seat Jerwood Theatre Downstairs, and the 85-seat studio theatre, now the Jerwood Theatre Upstairs. Since 1994, a new generation of playwrights debuting at the theatre has included Joe Penhall, Sarah Kane, Mark Ravenhill, Roy Williams amongst others. Since the 1990s, the Royal Court has placed an emphasis on the development and production of international plays. By 1993, the British Council had begun its support of the International Residency programme (which started in 1989 as the Royal Court International Summer School), and more recently the Genesis Foundation has also supported the production of international plays. The theatre received a 1999 International Theatre Institute award. In May 2008 The English Stage Company presented \"The Ugly One\" by Marius von Mayenburg at the \"Contact International Theatre Festival\" in Poland.\n\nArtistic Directors have included Ian Rickson (1998–2006), Max Stafford-Clark, Stuart Burge, Robert Kidd, Nicholas Wright, Lindsay Anderson, Anthony Page, and William Gaskill. From 2007 to 2012, the theatre's Artistic Director was Dominic Cooke and the deputy artistic director was Jeremy Herrin. Vicky Featherstone, the first female artistic director, previously founding head of the National Theatre of Scotland, replaced Cooke as Artistic Director in April 2013.\n\nCaryl Churchill's play \"Seven Jewish Children\" opened at the theatre in February 2009. Many Jewish leaders and journalists have criticised \"Seven Jewish Children\" as antisemitic, contending that it violates the rule that \"a play that is critical of, and entirely populated by, characters from one community, can be defended only if it is written by a member of that community\". Further, Associate Director Ramin Gray has been accused of hypocrisy, as he is reported to have stated that he would be reluctant to stage a play critical of Islam.\n\nMichael Billington in \"The Guardian\" described the play as \"a heartfelt lamentation for the future generations\". The paper contended that the play, though controversial, is not antisemitic, yet \"Seven Jewish Children\" was viewed by another \"Guardian\" writer as historically inaccurate and harshly critical of Jews. Jonathan Hoffman, co-vice chairman of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland, called the play \"a libellous and despicable demonisation of Israeli parents and grandparents\" and expressed fear that it would \"stoke the fires of antisemitism\". He added that the play is a modern blood libel drawing on old anti-Semitic myths. Jeffrey Goldberg of \"The Atlantic Monthly\" also calls the play a blood libel. Columnist Melanie Phillips wrote that the play is \"an open vilification of the Jewish people... drawing upon an atavistic hatred of the Jews\" and called it \"Open incitement to hatred\". \"The New York Times\" wrote that the play \"at times paints heartless images of Israelis.\"\n\nIn reply, the Royal Court issued the following statement:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "230955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230955", "title": "Running of the bulls", "text": "Running of the bulls\n\nThe running of the bulls (, from the verb \"encerrar\", 'to corral, to enclose'; , literally 'haste, momentum'; , 'street-bulls') is an event that involves running in front of a small group of cattle, typically six but sometimes ten or more, that have been let loose on a course of a sectioned-off subset of a town's streets, usually as part of a summertime festival. Particular breeds of cattle may be favored, such as the in Spain, also often used in post-run bullfighting, and Camargue cattle in Occitan France, which are not fought. Actual bulls (non-castrated male cattle) are typically used in such events.\n\nThe most famous bull-run – what a capitalized \"the Running of the Bulls\" most often refers to in English – is the held in Pamplona during the nine-day festival of Sanfermines in honour of Saint Fermin. It has become a major global tourism event, today very different from the traditional, local festival. More traditional summer bull-runs are held in other places such as towns and villages across Spain and Portugal, in some cities in Mexico, and in the Occitan (Camargue) region of southern France. Bull-running was formerly also practiced in rural England, most famously at Stamford until 1837.\n\nThe origin of this event comes from the need to transport the bulls from the fields outside the city, where they were bred, to the bullring, where they would be killed in the evening. During this \"run\", youngsters would jump among them to show off their bravado. In Pamplona and other places, the six bulls in the event are still those that will feature in the afternoon bullfight of the same day.\n\nSpanish tradition holds that bull-running began in northeastern Spain in the early 14th century. While transporting cattle in order to sell them at the market, men would try to speed the process by hurrying their cattle using tactics of fear and excitement. After years of this practice, the transportation and hurrying began to turn into a competition, as young adults would attempt to race in front of the bulls and make it safely to their pens without being overtaken. When the popularity of this practice increased and was noticed more and more by the expanding population of Spanish cities, a tradition was created and stands to this day.\n\nThe Pamplona encierro is the most popular in Spain and has been broadcast live by RTVE, the public Spanish national television channel, for over 30 years. It is the highest profile event of the San Fermín festival, which is held every year from 6–14 July. The first bull running is on 7 July, followed by one on each of the following mornings of the festival, beginning every day at 8 am. Among the rules to take part in the event are that participants must be at least 18 years old, run in the same direction as the bulls, not incite the bulls, and not be under the influence of alcohol.\n\nIn Pamplona, a set of wooden fences are erected to direct the bulls along the route and to block off side streets. A double wooden fence is used in those areas where there is enough space, while in other parts the buildings of the street act as barriers. The gaps in the barricades are wide enough for a human to slip through but narrow enough to block a bull. The fence is composed of approximately three thousand separate pieces of wood. Some parts of the fence remain in place for the duration of the fiesta, while others are placed and removed each morning. Spectators can only stand behind the second fence, whereas the space between the two fences is reserved for security and medical personnel and also to participants who need cover during the event.\n\nThe encierro begins with runners singing a benediction. It is sung three times, each time being sung both in Spanish and Basque. The benediction is a prayer given at a statue of Saint Fermin, patron of the festival and the city, to ask the saint's protection and can be translated into English as \"We ask Saint Fermin, as our Patron, to guide us through the encierro and give us his blessing\". The singers finish by shouting \" and ('Long live Saint Fermin', in Spanish and Basque, respectively). Most runners dress in the traditional clothing of the festival which consists of a white shirt and trousers with a red waistband () and neckerchief (). Also some of them hold the day's newspaper rolled to draw the bulls' attention from them if necessary.\n\nA first rocket is set off at 8 a.m. to alert the runners that the corral gate is open. A second rocket signals that all six bulls have been released. The third and fourth rockets are signals that all of the herd has entered the bullring and its corral respectively, marking the end of the event. The average duration between the first rocket and the end of the encierro is two minutes, 30 seconds.\n\nThe encierro is usually composed of the six bulls to be fought in the afternoon, six steers that run in herd with the bulls, and three more steers that follow the herd to encourage any reluctant bulls to continue along the route. The function of the steers, who run the route daily, is to guide the bulls to the bullring. The average speed of the herd is .\n\nThe length of the run is . It goes through four streets of the old part of the city (Santo Domingo, Ayuntamiento, Mercaderes and Estafeta) via the Town Hall Square and the short section \"Telefónica\" (named for the location of the old telephone office at end of Calle Estafeta) just before entering into the bullring through its callejón (tunnel). The fastest part of the route is up Santo Domingo and across the Town Hall Square, but the bulls often became separated at the entrance to Estafeta Street as they slowed down. One or more would slip going into the turn at Estafeta (\"la curva\"), resulting in the installation of anti-slip surfacing, and now most of the bulls negotiate the turn onto Estafeta and are often ahead of the steers. This has resulted in a quicker run. Runners are not permitted in the first 50 meters of the encierro, which is an uphill grade where the bulls are much faster.\n\nEvery year, between 50 and 100 people are injured during the run. Not all of the injuries require taking the patients to the hospital: in 2013, 50 people were taken by ambulance to Pamplona's hospital, with this number nearly doubling that of 2012.\n\nGoring is much less common but potentially life threatening. In 2013, for example, six participants were gored along the festival, in 2012, only four runners were injured by the horns of the bulls with exactly the same number of gored people in 2011, nine in 2010 and 10 in 2009; with one of the latter killed. As most of the runners are male, only 5 women have been gored since 1974. Before that date, running was prohibited for women.\n\nAnother major risk is runners falling and piling up (a \"montón\") at the entrance of the bullring, which acts as a funnel as it is much narrower than the previous street. In such cases injuries come both from asphyxia and contusions to those in the pile and from goring if the bulls crush into the pile. This kind of blocking of the entrance has occurred at least ten times in the history of the run, the last occurring in 2013 and the first dating back to 1878. A runner died of suffocation in one such pile up in 1977.\n\nOverall, since record-keeping began in 1910, 15 people have been killed in the bull running of Pamplona, most of them due to being gored. To minimize the impact of injuries every day 200 people collaborate in the medical attention. They are deployed in 16 sanitary posts (every 50 metres on average), each one with at least a physician and a nurse among their personnel. Most of these 200 people are volunteers, mainly from the Red Cross. In addition to the medical posts, there are around 20 ambulances. This organization makes it possible to have a gored person stabilized and taken to a hospital in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThough there is no formal dress code, the very common and traditional attire is white trousers, white shirt with a red scarf around the waist and a red handkerchief around the neck.\nAnother common dress practice, seen as a risk by some but as a daring depiction of courage by others is dressing in a conspicuous manner. Many runners that want to be seen wear colors other than white, a common alternate color choice is blue. Others include large logos on their shirt to capture the attention of the bulls. In the age of social media explosion, this is also thought to be a way to highlight someone in a photo.\n\nThe encierro of Pamplona has been depicted many times in literature, television or advertising, but became known worldwide partly because of the descriptions of Ernest Hemingway in books \"The Sun Also Rises\" and \"Death in the Afternoon\". The cinema pioneer Louis Lumière filmed the run in 1899.\n\nThe event is the basis for a chapter in James Michener's 1971 novel \"The Drifters\".\n\nThe run is depicted in the 1991 Billy Crystal film \"City Slickers\", where the character \"Mitch\" (Crystal) is gored (non-fatally) from behind by a bull during a vacation with the other main characters.\n\nThe run appears in the 2011 Bollywood movie \"Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara\", directed by Zoya Akhtar, as the final dare in the bucket list of the three bachelors who have to overcome their ultimate fear; death. At first, the trio run part of the route. They stop at the square, but then recover their nerve, and continue to the end. The completion of the run depicts their freedom as they learn that surviving a mortal danger can bring joy.\n\n\"Running with Bulls,\" a 2012 documentary of the festival filmed by Construct Creatives and presented by Jason Farrel, depicts the pros and cons of the controversial tradition.\n\nSince 2014, the Esquire Channel has broadcast the running of the bulls as a show in the US, with both live commentary and then a recorded 'round up' later in the day by NBCSN commentators the Men in Blazers, including interviews with noted participants such as Madrid-born runner David Ubeda, former US Special Forces soldier turned filmmaker Dennis Clancey, the historic New York-born runner Joe Distler, and former British bullfighter and author Alexander Fiske-Harrison.\n\nIn 2014, the eBook guide, \"Fiesta: How To Survive The Bulls Of Pamplona\", caused headlines around the world when one of the contributors was gored by a bull soon after its publication. (See Further Reading section below.)\n\nAlthough the most famous running of the bulls is that of San Fermín, they are held in towns and villages across Spain, Portugal, and in some cities in southern France during the summer. Examples are the bull run of San Sebastián de los Reyes, near Madrid, at the end of August which is the most popular of Spain after Pamplona, the bull run of Cuéllar, considered as the oldest of Spain since there are documents of its existence dating back to 1215, the Highland Capeias of the Raia in Sabugal, Portugal, with horses leading the herd crossing old border passes out of Spain and using the medieval 'Forcåo', or the bull run of Navalcarnero held at night.\n\nOther \"encierros\" have also caused fatalities.\n\n\"Bous al carrer\", \"correbou\" or \"correbous\" (meaning in Catalan, 'bulls in the street', 'street-bulls') is a typical festivity in many villages in the Valencian region, Terres de l'Ebre, Catalonia, and Fornalutx, Mallorca. Another similar tradition is \"soltes de vaques\", where cows are used instead of bulls. Even though they can take place all along the year, they are most usual during local festivals (normally in August). Compared to encierros, animals are not directed to any bullring.\n\nThese festivities are normally organized by the youngsters of the village, as a way for showing their courage and ability with the bull. Some sources consider this tradition a masculine initiation rite to adulthood.\n\nNumerous bull-running events happen in France in the region around Sommières, in accordance with the Camargues tradition, in which no bulls are intentionally injured or killed. For instance, in Calvisson, the annual event takes place around 20 July over a period of five days. There are four events: the , in which at least ten bulls are run together through the street guided by a group of twelve mounted on white Camargue horses; the , in which one bull is released outside the foyer and finds his own way back to the pen; the , in which one bull is run, accompanied through the streets; and the , which is the same thing but after dark. Boys and men run with the bulls and try and separate them from the horses, stop them, and physically turn them away from the horses.\n\nThe English town of Stamford, Lincolnshire was host to the Stamford bull run for almost 700 years until it was abandoned in 1837. According to local tradition, the custom dated from the time of King John when William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, saw two bulls fighting in the meadow beneath. Some butchers came to part the combatants and one of the bulls ran into the town, causing a great uproar. The earl, mounting his horse, rode after the animal, and enjoyed the sport so much, that he gave the meadow in which the fight began, to the butchers of Stamford, on condition that they should provide a bull, to be run in the town every 13 November, for ever after. As of 2013 the bull run had been revived as a ceremonial, festival-style community event.\n\nA variation is the nightly \"fire bull\" where balls of flammable material are placed on the horns. Currently the bull is often replaced by a runner carrying a frame on which fireworks are placed and dodgers, usually children, run to avoid the sparks.\n\nIn 2008, Red Bull Racing driver David Coulthard and Scuderia Toro Rosso driver Sébastien Bourdais performed a version of a 'bull running' event in Pamplona, Spain, with the Formula One cars chasing 500 runners through the actual Pamplona route.\nThe Big Easy Rollergirls roller derby team has performed an annual mock bull run in New Orleans, Louisiana since 2007. The team, dressed as bulls, skates after runners through the French Quarter. In 2012, there were 14,000 runners and over 400 \"bulls\" from all over the country, with huge before- and after-parties.\n\nIn Ballyjamesduff, Ireland, an annual event called the Pig Run is held with small pigs. It looks just like a mini- but with pigs instead of bulls.\n\nIn Dewey Beach, Delaware, a bar named The Starboard sponsors an annual Running of the Bull , in which hundreds of red- and white-clad beachgoers are chased down the shore by a single \"bull\" (two people in a pantomime horse-style costume).\n\nIn Rangiora, New Zealand, an annual Running of the Sheep is held, in which 1000–2000 sheep are released down the main street of the small farming town.\n\nThe Running of the Bulls UK is a pub crawl event that takes place on London's Hampstead Heath and uses fast human runners in place of bulls.\n\nIn 2014, Pamplona inaugurated a series of running events in June, the San Fermín Marathon, of a full marathon (42.195 km), half-marathon (21.097 km), or 10 km road race that concludes with the final 900m of each race using the route, runners crossing the finish line inside the bullring.\n\nMany opponents argue that bulls are mentally injured by the harassment and voicing of both participants and spectators, and some of animals may also die because of the stress, especially if they are roped or bring flares in their horns (bou embolat version). Despite all this, the festivities seem to have wide popular support in their villages\n\nMany animal rights activists oppose the event. PETA activists created the Running of the Nudes, a demonstration done two days before the beginning of San Fermín in Pamplona. By marching naked, they protested the festival and the following bullfight, arguing the bulls are tortured for entertainment.\n\nThe city of San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, cancelled its \"Sanmiguelada\" running of the bulls after 2006, citing public disorder associated with the event. After the event was cancelled in San Miguel, the city of Salvatierra, also in the state of Guanajuato, picked up the event. It is now called \"La Marquesada\" and the three-day event is held during the last weekend of the month of September or first weekend of October.\n\n\n\nSome links may contain graphic content where marked.\n\n"}

Today, the theatre is no longer used for opera, and is a venue for concerts, plays and dance performances, as well as exhibitions and conferences.\n\nThe original 3,000-seat theatre, surmounted by a large cupola, was constructed in the traditional horseshoe shape, with two tiers of boxes and a large gallery (or \"loggione\") which alone contained more than 1000 seats. It opened on September 14, 1872 with a production of Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\" and soon established itself as one of Italy's most important opera houses. During its \"golden years\", the theatre saw the world premieres of Puccini's \"Le Villi\" (May 31, 1884); Leoncavallo's \"Pagliacci\" (May 21, 1892) and \"I Medici\" (November 9, 1893); and Cowen's \"Signa\" (November 12, 1893). It also saw the Italian premiere of Lehár's \"The Merry Widow\" (April 27, 1907).\n\nBy the 1930s, the theatre was mainly being used as a cinema. It was then severely damaged by American aerial bombardment during World War II, after which its magnificent central cupola, which had survived the bombing, was stripped of all its metal parts by the occupying German army. It was partially rebuilt in 1946, and for a period in the 1950s it was used for the performance of musicals. It then reverted to a cinema and a political conference hall.\n\nIn 1991, the theatre's interior underwent a major restructuring and renovation project which was completed in 1998. It now has a large modern auditorium, the \"Sala Grande\", with 1420 seats, a smaller performing space known as the \"Sala Piccola\", with 200 seats, and a space for exhibitions and conferences, the \"Sala Terrazzo\". Since September 2001, it has been administered by the \"Fondazione I Pomeriggi Musicali\", whose orchestra (the Orchestra i Pomeriggi Musicali) is resident at the theatre.\n\n"}
{"id": "43399901", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43399901", "title": "The Historical Novel", "text": "The Historical Novel\n\nThe Historical Novel is a 1924 book by Herbert Butterfield. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by Cambridge University Press, one of the conditions for the prize.\n\nThe work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.\n\nIt examines the relationship between the form of the historical novel on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox historical method) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.\n\nButterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as Napoleon; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a \"maker of history\" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past. One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.\n\nThe work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.\n"}

For example, police officers in a number of jurisdictions have been charged with destroying pending tickets at the request of other officers. Judges have also been accused of ticket fixing. Some police officers consider it a \"professional courtesy\" extended to friends and relatives of police officers. However, the practice is unpopular with the general public, and is illegal in most jurisdictions.\n\nAllegations of ticket fixing have cropped up for decades in jurisdictions around the United States, including Georgia, Alabama, New York City, and San Diego.\n\nIn 1986, officers of the Georgia State Patrol faced charges of ticket fixing. In 1999, an investigation revealed widespread ticket-fixing in Alabama. In 2004, Santa Clara County judge William Danser faced charges of fixing tickets and reducing drunk driving sentences for \"South Bay athletes, golfing buddies and friends of friends.\" On October 27, 2011, at least 11 New York police officers were charged with offenses related to ticket fixing. A clerk in the San Francisco government faced ticket fixing accusations in 2012. Two police officers were charged with ticket fixing in Garden Grove, CA, in 2012. \n\n"}

Since the Coast Guard policy in 1962 was not to name cutters under in length, she was designated as \"WPB-82329\" when commissioned and was named \"Point Welcome\" in January 1964 when the Coast Guard began naming all cutters longer than . She was notable for being the victim of an inter-service friendly fire incident during the Vietnam War.\n\n\"Point Welcome\" was built to accommodate an 8-man crew. She was powered by two VT600 Cummins diesel main drive engines and had two five-bladed propellers. The main drive engines were later replaced by VT800 Cummins engines. Water tank capacity was and fuel tank capacity was at 95% full. Engine exhaust was ported through the transom rather than through a conventional stack and this permitted a 360 degree view from the bridge; a feature that was very useful in search and rescue work as well as a combat environment.\n\nThe design specifications for \"Point Welcome\" included a steel hull for durability, and an aluminum superstructure and longitudinally framed construction was used to save weight. Ease of operation with a small crew size was possible because of the non-manned main drive engine spaces. Controls and alarms located on the bridge allowed one man operation of the cutter thus eliminating a live engineer watch in the engine room. Because of design, four men could operate the cutter; however, the need for resting watchstanders brought the crew size to eight men for normal domestic service. The screws were designed for ease of replacement and could be changed without removing the cutter from the water. A clutch-in idle speed of three knots helped to conserve fuel on lengthy patrols and an eighteen knot maximum speed could get the cutter on scene quickly. Air-conditioned interior spaces were a part of the original design for the Point class cutter. Interior access to the deckhouse was through a watertight door on the starboard side aft of the deckhouse. The deckhouse contained the cabin for the officer-in-charge and the executive petty officer. The deckhouse also included a small arms locker, scuttlebutt, a small desk and head. Access to the lower deck and engine room was down a ladder. At the bottom of the ladder was the galley, mess and recreation deck. A watertight door at the front of the mess bulkhead led to the main crew quarters which was ten feet long and included six bunks that could be stowed, three bunks on each side. Forward of the bunks was the crew's head complete with a compact sink, shower and commode. Accommodations for a 13-man crew were installed for Vietnam War service.\n\nAfter delivery in 1962, \"Point Welcome\" was assigned a homeport of Everett, Washington, where she served as a law enforcement and search and rescue patrol boat.\n\nAt the request of the United States Navy, in April 1965, she was alerted for service in South Vietnam and assigned to Coast Guard Squadron One in support of Operation Market Time, along with 16 other Point class cutters. While the crew completed overseas training and weapons qualifications at Coast Guard Island and Camp Parks, California, \"Point Welcome\" was loaded onto a merchant ship, and transported to Subic Bay, Philippines in May 1965. She was refit for combat service. Shipyard modifications included installation of new single-sideband radio equipment, additional floodlights, small arms lockers, additional sound-powered phone circuits, and the addition of four M-2 machine guns. The original bow-mounted machine gun was replaced with a combination over-under 50 caliber machine gun/81mm trigger-fired mortar that had been developed by the Coast Guard for service in South Vietnam.\nFor service in Vietnam, two commissioned officers were added to the crew to add seniority in the mission of interdicting vessels at sea.\n\n\"Point Welcome\" was assigned to Division 12 of Squadron One to be based at Danang, along with , , , , , and . After sea trials, the Division left Subic Bay for Danang on 16 July 1965 in the company of , their temporary support ship. After almost two weeks at sea, they arrived at their new duty station on 20 July and began patrolling the coastal waters near Danang. Duty consisted of boarding Vietnamese junks to search for contraband weapons and ammunition and checking the identification papers of persons on board. Permanent engineering and logistic support of Division 12 was provided by a U.S. Navy non-self-propelled floating workshop, YR-71. During this time, the WPB's were directed to paint the hulls and superstructures formula 20 deck gray to cover the Coast Guard's stateside white paint. This increased the effectiveness of night patrols.\n\n\"Point Welcome\" was about three-quarters of a mile south of the 17th parallel, in the limits of the DMZ, when she was attacked in the pre-dawn hours of 11 August 1966 by three aircraft of the U.S. Air Force while on patrol in the waters near the mouth of the Cửa Việt River. Her commanding officer, LTJG David Brostrom, along with one crewman, EN2 Jerry Phillips, were killed in this friendly fire incident. Brostrom and Phillips were two of seven Coast Guardsmen killed in action during the Vietnam War. The ship's executive officer, LTJG Ross Bell was severely wounded leaving Chief Boatswain's Mate Richard Patterson in charge with several of the crew injured. A South Vietnamese liaison officer, LTJG Do Viet Vien, and civilian freelance journalist Tim Page, were aboard during the incident\n\nPatterson saved the cutter and the surviving crew at great risk to himself. He was awarded a Bronze Star with the combat \"V\" device for his actions that were described in his award citation:\n\n\"Point Caution\" came to the assistance of the \"Point Welcome\" and along with other units, rescued those in the water. Soon thereafter Patterson and those of his crew that were not seriously wounded returned to their cutter. They then sailed \"Point Welcome\" back to Danang under her own power. She was repaired after a three-month overhaul and returned to service. Investigations by the Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV) involving 37 witnesses were conducted from the 15th through the 23rd of August 1966 and concluded with a statement to the Commandant of the Coast Guard that: In 1966 the board of investigation issued its 159-page record and recommendations, including \"That no disciplinary action be taken against any personnel involved in the incident.\" And further:\n\nOn 29 February and 1 March 1968, \"Point Welcome\" assisted in the destruction of an SL-class North Vietnamese trawler near Cu Lao Re island, southeast of Danang. On the afternoon of 29 February 1968 the took the trawler under surveillance after it was first detected by a P-2 Neptune aircraft south of the demilitarized zone. \"Point Welcome\" and , along with two U.S. Navy swift boats, waited close to shore as the trawler approached, with \"Androscoggin\" trailing. In the early morning of 1 March 1968 as the trawler closed to within seven miles (11 km) of the coast, \"Androscoggin\" closed and challenged the trawler. After receiving no response, \"Androscoggin\" illuminated the target with star shells. The trawler, positively identified as a North Vietnamese SL-class vessel, opened fire on the cutter with recoilless rifle and machine gun fire. \"Androscoggin\" then opened fire with her battery, scoring one hit on the trawler's \"after starboard side.\" The trawler then headed for the beach. Two helicopters took the trawler under fire while the 82-footers and swift boats closed. \"Point Welcome\" illuminated the target with illumination rounds fired from her 81-mm mortar while \"Point Grey\" and the swift boats fired their .50 caliber machine guns into the trawler. It grounded from the mouth of the Song Tha Cau river. \"Point Welcome\" then hit the target with two high explosive mortar rounds from her 81-mm mortar. The trawler soon thereafter exploded, leaving little trace. The cutters were hit with debris but suffered no personnel casualties.\n\nShe was transferred to the Republic of Vietnam Navy as RVNS \"Nguyễn Hấn\" (HQ-717), 29 April 1970.\n\n"}

It is a member of the United Nations Development Group and was renamed the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in 2002. In 2016–2017 it has an estimated biannual budget of US$700 million.\n\nThe agency, employing between 1,500 and 2,000 people worldwide, has its headquarters in Vienna (Austria), with 21 field offices and two liaison offices in Brussels and in New York City. The United Nations Secretary-General appoints the agency's Executive Director. Yuri Fedotov, the former Russian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, has held this position since his appointment in 2010, when he succeeded Antonio Maria Costa in his personal capacity, and also as Director-General of the United Nations Office at Vienna.\n\nUNODC incorporates the secretariat of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).\n\nUNODC was established to assist the UN in better addressing a coordinated, comprehensive response to the interrelated issues of illicit traficking in and abuse of drugs, crime prevention and criminal justice, international terrorism, and political corruption These goals are pursued through three primary functions: research, guidance and support to governments in the adoption and implementation of various crime-, drug-, terrorism-, and corruption-related conventions, treaties and protocols, as well as technical/financial assistance to said governments to face their respective situations and challenges in these fields.\n\nThe office aims long-term to better equip governments to handle drug-, crime-, terrorism-, and corruption-related issues, to maximise knowledge on these issues among governmental institutions and agencies, and also to maximise awareness of said matters in public opinion, globally, nationally and at community level. Approximately 90% of the Office's funding comes from voluntary \"contributions\", mainly from governments.\n\nThese are the main themes that UNODC deals with: Alternative Development, anti-corruption, Criminal Justice, Prison Reform and Crime Prevention, Drug Prevention, -Treatment and Care, HIV and AIDS, Human Trafficking and Migrant Smuggling, Money Laundering, Organized Crime, Piracy, Terrorism Prevention.\n\nThe World Drug Report is a yearly publication that presents a comprehensive assessment of the international drug problem, with detailed information on the illicit drug situation. It provides estimates and information on trends in the production, trafficking and use of opium/heroin, coca/cocaine, cannabis and amphetamine-type stimulants. The Report, based on data and estimates collected or prepared by Governments, UNODC and other international institutions, attempts to identify trends in the evolution of global illicit drug markets.\n\nThrough the World Drug Report, UNODC aims to enhance Member States' understanding of global illicit drug trends and increase their awareness of the need for the more systematic collection and reporting of data relating to illicit drugs.\n\nUnited Nations Conventions and their related Protocols underpin all the operational work of UNODC.\n\nThe United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime is a legally binding instrument that entered into force on 29 September 2003, through which States parties commit to taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. States that ratify the convention has the duty of creation of domestic offences to combat the problem, the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law enforcement cooperation, technical assistance and training. The convention signifies an important stage in dealing with transnational crime by recognizing the seriousness of the problem that the crime poses, and gaining understanding from the member states of the importance of a cooperative measure. The convention is complemented by three different protocols: \n\n\nThe Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children aims to provide a convergence in the states' domestic offences in the investigation and the persecution process. Another objective of the protocol is to protect the victims of trafficking in persons with full respect.\n\nThe Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air is concerned with the aggravating problem of organized crime groups for smuggling persons. The protocol aims to combat and prevent transnational smuggling as well as to promote cooperative measures for enhancing protective measures for victims.\n\nThe Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their Parts and Components and Ammunition was adopted to prevent and provide a cooperative measure for illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition. By adopting the protocol, the member states commit to adopt domestic criminal offences for illegal manufacturing, providing governmental licensing ammunition, and keeping track of the ammunition.\n\nIn its resolution 55/61, the General Assembly recognized that an effective international legal instrument against corruption, independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime was desirable. The text of the Convention was negotiated during seven sessions held between 21 January 2002 and 1 October 2003. The Convention was adopted by the General Assembly on 31 October 2003.\nIn 2003, the United Nations adopted the UN Convention against Corruption (UNCAC). The Convention came into force in December 2005. As of 9 November 2012, 140 countries had signed and 164 countries (States Parties) had ratified the UNCAC. UNODC serves as the Secretariat for the Conference of the States Parties (CoSP) to the UNCAC.\n\nUNODC, as the custodian of UNCAC, is also one of the main initiators of the establishment of the International Anti-Corruption Academy (IACA), whose main function is to, among other things, facilitate more effective implementation of the UNCAC.\n\nThere are three drug related treaties that guide UNODC's drug related programs. These are: The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol ; the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971 and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988.\n\nThese three major international drug control treaties are mutually supportive and complementary. An important purpose of the first two treaties is to codify internationally applicable control measures in order to ensure the availability of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances for medical and scientific purposes, and to prevent their diversion into illicit channels. They also include general provisions on trafficking and drug abuse.\n\nUNODC launches campaigns to raise awareness of drugs and crime problems. On 26 June every year, UNODC marks the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking. \nOn 9 December every year, UNODC commemorates the International Anti-Corruption Day.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) started this international campaign to raise awareness about the major challenge that illicit drugs represent to society as a whole, and especially to the young. The goal of the campaign is to mobilize support and to inspire people to act against drug abuse and trafficking. The campaign encourages young people to put their health first and not to take drugs.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has teamed up with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to run this campaign as a focus on how corruption hinders efforts to achieve the internationally agreed upon MDGs, undermines democracy and the rule of law, leads to human rights violations, distorts markets, erodes quality of life and allows organized crime, terrorism and other threats to human security to flourish.\n\nYoung people aged 15 to 24 account for an estimated 40 per cent of new adult (15+) HIV infections worldwide. In some parts of the world, and in some marginalized sub-groups, the most frequent modes of HIV transmission for these young people are unsafe injecting drug use and unsafe sexual activities.\n\nBecause young people are also often more likely to use drugs, The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) targets this population with a campaign to raise awareness about drug use and its connection to the spread of HIV and AIDS. The slogan: \"Think Before You Start ... Before You Shoot ... Before You Share\" is used to provoke young people to consider the implications of using drugs, and particularly injecting drugs.\n\nThe Blue Heart Campaign seeks to encourage involvement and action to help stop trafficking in persons. The campaign also allows people to show solidarity with the victims of human trafficking by wearing the Blue Heart. The use of the blue UN colour demonstrates the commitment of the United Nations to combat this crime.\n\nIn 2007, the five largest donors to UNODC's budget in descending order were: European Union, Canada, United States, the UN itself, and Sweden. According to the Transnational Institute this explains why, until recently, UNODC did not promote harm reduction policies like needle exchange and Heroin-assisted treatment. (This despite the actions of United Nations bodies (i.e. WHO and UNAIDS), who support these policies.) UNODC promotes other methods for drug use prevention, treatment and care that UNODC sees as \"based on scientific evidence and on ethical standards\".\nThe UNODC has been criticized by human rights organizations such as Amnesty international for not promoting the inclusion of adherence to international human rights standards within its project in Iran. Amnesty states that in Iran there are \"serious concerns regarding unfair trials and executions of those suspected of drug offences in Iran.\n\nIn June 2012, Mohammad Reza Rahimi the Iranian Vice President made some controversial remarks during a speech at a UNODC Drugs and Crime conference in Tehran.\n\nHe then went on to blame the Talmud, a key Jewish religious text, for the expansion of illegal drugs around the world and said that it teaches to \"destroy everyone who opposes the Jews.\"\n\nRahimi was widely condemned for his controversial remarks:\n\n\n\n"}

It was the first slogan of a set of reforms that also included \"perestroika\" (restructuring), \"glasnost\" (transparency), \"new political thinking\", and \"democratisation\".\n\nIn May 1985, Gorbachev gave a speech in Leningrad, during which he admitted the slowing down of the economic development and inadequacy of living standards. This was the first time in history that a Soviet leader had done so.\n\nThe program was furthered at the 27th Congress of the Communist Party in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about \"perestroika\", \"uskoreniye\", \"human factor\", \"glasnost\", and \"expansion of the khozraschyot\" (commercialization). The acceleration was planned to be based on technical and scientific progress, revamping of heavy industry (in accordance with the Marxian economics postulate about the primacy in development of heavy industry over light industry), taking the \"human factor\" into account, and increasing the labour discipline and responsibility of apparatchiks. In practice it was implemented with the help of massive monetary emission infused into heavy industry, which further destabilised the economy and in particular brought an enormous disparity between actual cash money and virtual money used in cashless clearings (безналичный расчёт) between enterprises and state and among enterprises.\n\nThe politics of mere \"acceleration\" eventually failed, which was \"de facto\" admitted in June 1987 at a Party Plenum, and the \"uskoreniye\" slogan was phased out in favor of the more ambitious \"Perestroika\" (restructuring of the whole economy).\n\n"}
