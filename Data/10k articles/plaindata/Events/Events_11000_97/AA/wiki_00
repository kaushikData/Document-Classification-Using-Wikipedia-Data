The aircraft had been flying in international waters, as was later shown by Madeleine Albright at the United Nations. Killed in the incident were Cessna pilots Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales.\n\nOn 24 February 1996, two of the Brothers to the Rescue Cessna Skymasters were shot down by a Cuban Air Force Mikoyan MiG-29UB, while a second jet fighter, a MiG-23, orbited nearby. Killed in the shootdowns were pilots Carlos Costa, Armando Alejandre, Jr., Mario de la Peña, and Pablo Morales. A third aircraft, flown by Basulto, escaped. It is claimed the first aircraft was downed 9 nautical miles (10.4 statute miles; 16.7 km) outside Cuban territorial airspace and the second aircraft was downed 10 nautical miles (11.5 statute miles; 18.5 km) outside Cuban airspace. The aircraft used were Cessna 337s, a twin-engine civilian light aircraft. A type similar to those owned by Brothers to the Rescue, designated the Cessna O-2A Super Skymaster, was in use by the United States military until 2010. Cuba claimed that the letters USAF were visible on them. It is claimed the Cuban Air Force pilots' radio transmissions proved that they had been identified as belonging to Brothers to the Rescue before the shootdown.\nThe incident was investigated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Their report concluded that the authorities in Cuba had notified the authorities in the United States of multiple violations of their airspace since May 1994. In at least one case (13 July 1995), the pilot had released leaflets over Havana. The United States authorities had issued public statements advising of the potential consequences of unauthorized entry into Cuban airspace and had initiated legal actions against Basulto, but had retained his certification to fly during appeal. After Basulto was warned by an FAA official about the possibility of being shot down, he replied, \"You must understand I have a mission in life to perform\", disregarding the potential danger involved. He would later say he considered the group's activities to be acts of civil disobedience against the regime, and a demonstration that such disobedience was possible.\n\nAccording to Cuban authorities, two light aircraft entered Cuban territorial airspace on 9 and 13 January 1996, and released leaflets which fell on Cuban territory. According to the pilot of one of the aircraft, half a million leaflets were released on 13 January; he also claims they were released outside the 12-mile (22 km) Cuban territorial limit and the wind carried them to Havana. This version of events was detailed by Juan Pablo Roque, the man who had returned to Cuba the day before the shootdown and who was later implicated as having helped organize the shootdown as a Cuban spy placed with the group. According to Roque, Basulto had dropped the leaflets from 10 miles north of Havana, not the stated 12 miles, from a high altitude on a day when the winds would carry them south toward Cuba. Specifically, in a Cuban television interview days after the shootdown took place, Roque, from within Cuba, stated, \"I personally have violated air space, specifically the last was on 9 January 1996, where I got a call the day before to participate in a flight to Havana where thousands of leaflets were going to be released from a height of more than 9,500 feet at a distance of less than 10 miles from the coast.\"\n\nFollowing that incident, the ICAO report states, the Commander of the Anti-Aircraft Defence of the Air Force of Cuba was instructed to intercept any further flights and was authorized to shoot them down, whether or not they had entered Cuban airspace.\n\nOn 24 February 1996, the group's aircraft flew another mission. While the Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were still north of the 24th parallel, the Cuban Air Force ordered the scrambling of two military aircraft, a MiG-29 and a MiG-23, operating under the control of a military station on Cuban soil. The MiGs were carrying short-range missiles, bombs, and rockets, and they were flown by members of the Cuban Air Force.\n\nTwo of the group's three aircraft flying that day were shot down. With the downing of each aircraft, the Cuban pilots could be heard celebrating over the radio. Terms like \"cojones\" were repeatedly used by the Cuban fighter pilots. Their radio transmissions included statements such as \"We blew his balls off!\" In a reference to the Cuban MiG pilot's understanding that the aircraft they were attacking were the same ones that had been repeatedly and continuously flying off Cuba's coast, they also transmitted the following, \"He won't give us any more fucking trouble.\" Finally, the Cuban MiG pilots also said, \"The other one is destroyed; the other one is destroyed. Homeland or death (\"patria o muerte\"), you bastards! The other one is also down.\"\n\nSubsequently, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights issued a report that concluded, \"The fact that weapons of war and combat-trained pilots were used against unarmed civilians shows not only how disproportionate the use of force was, but also the intent to end the lives of those individuals. It is claimed the extracts from the radio communications between the MiG-29 pilots and the military control tower indicate that they acted from a superior position and showed malice and scorn toward the human dignity of the victims.\"\n\nThe third Brothers to the Rescue aircraft, with Basulto on board, was also identified for intercept and was to be shot down but escaped.\n\nTestimony from a US Colonel Buchner expressed support for Cuba's claim that both Brothers aircraft, along with a third flown by Basulto, were only four to five miles off the Cuban coast.The statement by USAF Colonel Buchner is directly contradictory to eye-witness testimony and verified radar data documentation provided by Department of the Treasury, Supervisory Detection Systems Specialist J. Houlihan during sworn testimony before an FAA Administrative Hearing in 1996, and the House of Representatives, Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on International Relations, Washington D.C. September 18, 1996. \n\nIt is claimed the aircraft that were shot down were both very near (and, in one case, directly above) a U.S fishing vessel named \"Tri-Liner\". Also nearby was the cruise ship \"Majesty of the Seas\".\n\nIt is claimed that the ICAO report also states that means other than interception, such as radio communication, had been available to Cuba, but had not been utilized, and that this conflicts with the ICAO principle that interception of civil aircraft should be undertaken only as a last resort. It is also claimed the Cuban Air Force did not make any attempt to direct the aircraft beyond the boundaries of national airspace, guide them away from a prohibited, restricted or danger area or instruct them to effect a landing.\n\nFollowing the incident, the United Nations Security Council passed Security Council Resolution 1067 (1996), a U.S.-sponsored resolution condemning Cuba. Dissenting members believed that the resolution was singling out Cuba for condemnation, and instead should have issued a call which urged both states to refrain from shooting down civilian airplanes as well as to prevent the improper use of civil aviation.\n\nIn Miami, reaction from the exile community was swift. The late Jorge Mas Canosa, co-founder and leader of the Cuban American National Foundation, condemned the attack: \"For two warplanes from the Castro government to shoot down two unarmed civilian aircraft with American flags on a humanitarian mission should be considered an act of war against the US\".\n\nAfter the attack, the pilots responsible were the twin brothers, El Teniente (LTC) Colonel Lorenzo Alberto Perez Perez and his \"Guy in Back,\" El Teniente Colonel (LTC) Francisco Perez Perez. Both were charged in the United States for their role in the attack.\n\nMiguel Alfonso Martinez of the Cuban Foreign Ministry said that the two aircraft that were shot down were \"not common civilian aircraft\" as suggested by the US. \"This is not the case of an innocent civilian airliner that, because of an instrument error, departs from an air corridor and gets into the airspace of another country\". \"These people knew what they were doing. They were warned. They wanted to take certain actions that were clearly intended to destabilize the Cuban government and the US authorities knew about their intentions\".\n\nGroups sympathetic to Cuba, while not approving the shootdown, noted \"the policies of the United States government of indefensible hostility against the island of Cuba that sit at the heart of the matter\", citing constant threats and a history of military and paramilitary attacks on Cuba from the US and paramilitary groups.\n\n\"Shoot Down\", a documentary film that illustrates the incident from the Brothers to the Rescue perspective, was released in 2006 and rereleased in an updated, edited version on January 25, 2008. It was directed by Cristina Khuly, niece of downed pilot Armando Alejandre Jr.\n"}

{"id": "3178719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3178719", "title": "Andersonville (film)", "text": "Andersonville (film)\n\nAndersonville is a 1996 American television film directed by John Frankenheimer about a group of Union soldiers during the American Civil War who are captured by the Confederates and sent to an infamous Confederate prison camp.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the diary of John Ransom, a Union soldier imprisoned there. Although certain points of the plot are fabricated, the general conditions of the camp accurately match Ransom's descriptions, particularly references to the administration of the camp by Captain Henry Wirz. His line on escaping prisoners is very similar to the book, \"The Flying Dutchman [Wirz] offers to give two at a time twelve hours the start\".\n\nThe film begins with a group of Union soldiers being captured and forced to surrender at Cold Harbor, Virginia, in June 1864. They are transported to prisoner-of-war Camp Sumter, near Andersonville, Georgia. When they enter, they discover a former comrade, named Dick Potter, who was captured at Antietam, who explains the grim realities of daily existence in the camp – primarily the lack of shelter, clean water, and regular food supplies. He also states the danger of a rogue group of Union soldiers, called the \"Raiders\", who hoard the camp's meager rations, and lure unsuspecting \"fresh fish\" – newly captured soldiers – into their area of the camp, to attack and rob them.\n\nWith every able-bodied man required for fighting, young teenagers and old men are used as guards. At one watch tower, manned by two young guards, a Union soldier offers money for some corn. He is instructed to step over the \"dead line\" fence and approach the watch tower to trade, which contradicts the rules of the camp. But reluctantly, compelled by need, the soldier steps over the line, and (in a macabre type of game) the soldiers in the next watch tower shoot him dead.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the unit captured at the beginning of the film ally with some inmates, and help them by working on their tunnel under the stockade wall. Eventually it is complete, but one man tries to inform the guards, in hope of receiving a reward. He is captured and \"TT\" (meaning tunnel traitor) is cut into his forehead as a warning. The escape is attempted one night, and all goes well until the last man is spotted and shot, and the dogs are unleashed. In a very short time, most escapees are back in the camp and placed in standing stocks as punishment.\n\nThe situation with the Raiders eventually becomes unbearable, as group after group of new prisoners are targeted upon arrival. Night raids are made, with possessions being taken from tents and prisoners injured or killed by the Raiders. After a banjo is stolen, one man fights to get it back but is badly beaten. Things progressively get worse until finally one man decides he has seen enough of the \"vultures out to rob and murder the new boys\". He rallies support from the disparate groups, and within minutes hundreds of his comrades are charging the Raiders' camp. A massive and deadly riot ensues.\n\nIn the end the Raiders are beaten, stolen goods are redistributed to their owners, but many want them all hanged outright. But upon the insistence of a few, a request for a legitimate trial is made to Captain Wirz, the Confederate commander of the prison camp. A trial is held, with a jury made up of new internees, which ultimately results in the six ring-leaders being found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. After the executions life becomes relatively peaceful, but the cold reality of starvation, and lack of sanitation or medical care, begins to set in as emaciation, dysentery, scurvy, and fever take their toll, causing many to die. As the film ends, an announcement is made by Wirz that all prisoners are to be exchanged – the surviving Federal soldiers leave the camp, filing past their dead comrades on the way to the trains.\n\nAgainst a view of the present-day Andersonville National Cemetery, the movie's end coda reads:\n\n\nThe mini series was a pet project of mogul Ted Turner, an American Civil War enthusiast who wanted to bring to the screen a series of historically accurate films about the conflict. After the critical acclaim and financial success of his previous production \"Gettysburg\" in 1993, he would go on to produce its prequel \"Gods and Generals\" in 2003. All were massive productions on huge scales.\n\n\"Andersonville\" was filmed on location on a farm some fifty miles south of Atlanta (about a hundred miles north of the actual location of the camp) where a huge set was built (not quite to scale) of the actual camp. Accurate in detail down to the officer's quarters outside the camp gates, the fifty foot high raw timber walls and thousands of ragged tents, a working stream, and even a full scale railway depot with half of a locomotive made of wood were built on the property. At any given time there were hundreds of extras employed every day, many of whom were Civil War reenactors who came from all over the nation to take part in the production. Their deep devotion to the subject matter and attention to detail gave the film much of its authenticity. Many of the extras were also college students, both men and women brought in by the busload for the larger scenes. At its height more than four thousand extras a day were employed, making it necessary to have an ultra early call time of three a.m. for a general set call of seven. Dozens of additional makeup, hair, wardrobe and production staff were needed for these scenes, which actually went very well due to military style organization with the \"troops\" even being marched in platoons from the preparation tents to the set.\n\nShot in the early to late fall of 1994, it was a typical southern season of change with the weather proving difficult at best. With temperatures swinging between extremely hot to cold and rainy, the heavy red clay that makes up Georgia soil would turn into a sludge up to three feet deep during rains and would solidify to rock hard status a day later when temperatures soared. Long days took their toll on the cast and crew and the situation came to a head when disaster struck at the end of principal photography. \nThe critical scenes involving the trials and hanging of the raiders were shot over two days with the raw film being shipped out to Los Angeles labs every few days. The crate containing this film was lost in transit by the shipping company and though there was tremendous effort to find it the film was never located. Shooting had just wrapped with sets being torn down and the farm location restored. This necessitated a partial re-building of the set on location in North Carolina and a gathering of all the principal actors involved in the scenes for a very costly re-shoot which took about a week to complete.\n\nThe program won a 1996 Emmy for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Directing for a Miniseries or a Special for director John Frankenheimer. It was nominated in six other categories as well, including a nomination for cinematographer, Ric Waite.\n\n"}

He was arrested in Tennessee in July 2007 – and found guilty in 2010 – for the June 26, 2007 murder of Sara Hulbert. The body was found by the security guard on duty that night. A long haul trucker, his truck was found to contain the blood of numerous other murdered or missing women. He has been charged with the murders of three other women at truck stops in Alabama, Indiana and Tennessee. He is still under investigation for murders in Georgia, Illinois, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas—some of which carry the death penalty.\n\nMendenhall grew up in Crawford County, Illinois. \n\nHe was married to Linda, and they had two daughters. Linda, who has since died, had reportedly gone blind from diabetes. Mendenhall never had problems with the law, though his wife and friends knew he kept a gun illegally in his truck.\n\nA resident of Albion, Illinois, Mendenhall was arrested at the TA truck stop on Interstate 24 in Nashville, Tennessee on July 12, 2007 after Detective Sgt. Pat Postiglione spotted a truck that matched surveillance footage from the night Sara Nicole Hulbert was murdered at the same truck stop. Upon inspection of the vehicle, a large quantity of bloody clothing and identification and personal effects of an Indianapolis woman, who went missing the day before, was found in a plastic sack along with blood spots scattered around the inside of his cab to include the steering wheel and even on his hands when arrested and Mendenhall was taken into custody. Police catalogued 300 items from the truck including a rifle, knives, handcuffs, latex gloves, several weapons cartridges, black tape, a nightstick, and sex toys. Sampling of these items turned up the DNA of five different women. On August 2, 2007, Mendenhall waived his right to a preliminary hearing.\n\nMendenhall's victims were primarily young prostitutes, usually found shot, though detectives have determined that his method of killing may have changed over the years. During questioning, he implicated himself in the shooting death of Hulbert, whose body was found on June 26, 2007. \n\nHe has also implicated himself in the shooting death of Symantha Winters, whose body was found June 6, 2007 in a trash can at a truck stop in Lebanon, Tennessee. She had a criminal record showing at least one previous charge of prostitution. On August 17, 2007, a Wilson County grand jury indicted Mendenhall for the murder of Winters. He was subsequently convicted and sentenced to life. \n\nAnother victim killed on July 11, 2007 at a Flying J truck stop on Interstate 465 in Indianapolis, Indiana was recently found. Carma Purpura, a 31-year-old mother of two, was last seen at the far-southside Indianapolis truck stop. On April 10, 2008, Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi charged Mendenhall with murder in the case. DNA tests link a large quantity of the blood from Mendenhall's truck cab to the woman's parents. Investigators also found her cell phone, ATM card and clothing she wore on the day she disappeared. Four years later her remains were discovered just off I-65 in Kentucky.\n\nOn July 28, police in Birmingham, Alabama charged Mendenhall with the murder of Lucille \"Gretna\" Carter, who was found nude in a trash bin with a plastic bag taped around her head on July 1. She was shot with a .22 caliber weapon.\n\nInvestigators said Mendenhall was initially cooperative, but subsequently ceased to implicate himself in other murders. Police are investigating the possibility that Mendenhall is responsible for other murders in the region including:\n\n\nUntil August 2009, Mendenhall was considered in the murder of Jennifer Smith, a prostitute found nude at a truck stop in Bucksnort, Tennessee in April 2005. DNA evidence in 2009 proved that she was the second victim of killer John Wayne Boyer.\n\nWhile he was in jail, Mendenhall's wife died of natural causes and he came upon some insurance money. He separately approached two inmates with offers to pay them $15,000 to murder the three associates that Mendenhall had implicated in his original statement to police. One of the murders was to be performed in a \"copycat\" fashion to lead police to believe the killer was still at large. \n\nFor the crime of conspiracy to commit murder he was convicted and sentenced to an additional 30 years.\n\nMendenhall was also initially accused of solicitation of the murders of the two detectives involved in his arrest and questioning. Those charges were later dropped.\n\n"}
{"id": "56834957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56834957", "title": "David Bowie Is", "text": "David Bowie Is\n\nDavid Bowie Is was a touring museum exhibit displaying history, artifacts and information about the life, music, films, tours, and art of English singer-songwriter and actor David Bowie.\nThe show opened in March 2013 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, and ended in July 2018 at the Brooklyn Museum in New York City. Over its 5 year run, it stopped at 12 museums around the world and attracted over 2 million visitors.\n\nAt each museum, the exhibit displayed about 500 objects, often with a few hundred unique to that particular museum.\n\nAn accompanying documentary film, also titled \"David Bowie Is\", was directed by Hamish Hamilton, Katy Mullan, and Hanif Kureishi.\n\nAfter the exhibit closed in July 2018, it was announced that in early 2019 a new, virtual version of the exhibit would be released on virtual and augmented reality platforms.\n\nNear the end of 2010, an archivist for Bowie's collection contacted the Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) and asked if they'd be interested in a display. Bowie had saved most of the artifacts, costumes, and props from his career and had almost 75,000 pieces in a private collection.\n\nBowie allowed Victoria Broackes and Geoffrey Marsh, the V&A museum curators, free access to his archives for the show, although he did not get involved with how the pieces were displayed, nor the narrative of the show itself. According to museum directors at the Brooklyn Museum, “David Bowie asked that the exhibit open in London and close here [in New York]”. The V&A Museum worked with 59 Productions and Real Studios to design the exhibit.\n\nWhen the show was first booked at the V&A Museum, it was not generally felt that the exhibit would be very successful. However, it became the museum's fastest selling show with over 300,000 visitors. The success of the show at the V&A museum resulted in the decision to take the exhibit on tour, and it has sold roughly two million tickets across 11 cities around the world as of March 2018. As of 2018, the \"David Bowie Is\" exhibition holds the record for being the most visited exhibit in the V&A Museum's history.\n\nWhen Bowie died in early 2016, the museum tour was almost canceled, with concerns for if and how the show would go on. There were also discussions as to whether to keep the name in the present tense (David Bowie \"Is\"). The exhibit, which was at the Groninger Museum in the Netherlands at the time, instead extended the show for 4 weeks to allow grieving fans to attend.\n\nA typical stop of the exhibit included around 500 objects, including over 60 performance costumes, handwritten lyrics, and Bowie's own oil paintings. The exhibition was organized thematically rather than chronologically. It included outfits designed by Alexander McQueen, Hedi Slimane, Issey Miyake, Vivienne Westwood and Kansai Yamamoto. There were over 50 video pieces, including television performances, music videos and concert footage. Music journalist Dan Hyman wrote in \"Rolling Stone\" of the Chicago exhibition that the retrospective taught him five things about Bowie; Namely that Bowie was \"... a Fantastic Painter and Illustrator…\", \"…an Avid Collector of Minutiae…\", \"…a Style Icon…\", \"…a Tech Geek at Heart…\", and \"…an Unflinching Self-Editor…\".\nSome museums included items unique to their country or city, reflecting Bowie's connection to the area. For example, in New York, where Bowie lived, Brooklyn Museum's Matthew Yokobosky said “We have the original backdrop from when he performed in \"The Elephant Man\" on Broadway, and moments from when he worked on Julian Schnabel’s film \"Basquiat\", on the life of New York artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. … While most of the \"Young Americans\" album was recorded in Philadelphia, \"Fame\" was actually recorded in New York City. That's how John Lennon just happened to stop by the studio that day. He [Lennon] actually did a drawing for David in the studio and I have that drawing in the show.” Yokobosky also spoke about how and why they got the letters \"BOWIE\" for the exhibit: “The first time I met with Bowie’s archivist at the archive, I looked down one of the aisles and saw a photograph of the letter W resting on a case. I asked what it was, and the archivist told me that it corresponded to one of the letters from Bowie’s New York marathon tour in 2002, when he played five theaters in five boroughs of the city in five days—and every night they moved these brilliant letters which spelled out his name in light bulbs. Well, I saw that tour in the Beacon Theater, and I just blurted out, ‘I want the letters.’ They hadn’t been seen since that tour, and we spent two months trying to figure out how to get them to work again.”\n\nWhile in Berlin at the Martin-Gropius-Bau museum, the exhibition added pieces from Bowie’s time in West Berlin, his collaborations with Iggy Pop, and his Berlin Trilogy: \"Low\" (1977), \"\"Heroes\"\" (1977), and \"Lodger\" (1979).\n\nWhen \"David Bowie Is\" opened in Tokyo, pieces from Japanese collaborator Kansai Yamamoto were highlighted, having designed costumes during Bowie's Ziggy Stardust (1972) and Aladdin Sane (1973) periods.\n\nThe V&A Museum worked with audio company Sennheiser to create a custom audio experience for the exhibit. Originally the curators were nervous to ask visitors to wear headphones, fearing it would isolate them. As visitors walked around the exhibit, the audio changed as they entered \"spheres\" of Bowie's work, relating to particular events, people or cities that the artist has worked in. The headphones required no interaction; the music and information you hear simply changed as you approached different parts of the exhibit. Producer Tony Visconti, who worked with Bowie for many years, created a unique megamix from the master tapes of more than 60 Bowie songs for the exhibition.\n\nPart of the exhibition included a cavernous room with large video screens displaying various Bowie live performances throughout the years and featuring surround sound, in which visitors were asked to remove their headphones.\n\n\n"}

The governor noted that in the past, Texans \"have been strengthened, assured and lifted up through prayer\", and that he thus believed prayer to be an appropriate measure to address the drought.\n\nPerry designated the Days of Prayer in a gubernatorial proclamation issued on April 21. Precedents for his action included similar initiatives in Texas at the municipal level and a prayer service for rain led by Georgia governor Sonny Perdue in 2007.\n\nThe proclamation, which did not specify a text for the prayer and called for the \"Days of Prayer\" to begin on Good Friday, received some criticism.\n\nThe drought continued to worsen for four months following the Days of Prayer. While only 15-17% of the state was undergoing exceptional drought by late April, the percentage grew to 50% a month later, and by late June, more than 70% of the state was experiencing exceptional drought conditions, a level at which it persisted until August 18, 2011. Most of the drought conditions subsided by the end of summer, when rain returned to various parts of Texas.\n\nThe first major rain in the state after the Days of Prayer came 168 days later on October 9, 2011. \n"}

Major components ranged from about 5 to 15 years in age, and included the Mir Core Module, Kvant-1, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr, Priroda, and Docking Module. Although Russia was optimistic about \"Mir\"'s future, the country's commitments to the International Space Station project left no funding to support \"Mir\".\n\nThe deorbit was carried out in three stages. The first stage was waiting for atmospheric drag to decay the orbit to an average of . This began with the docking of Progress M1-5. The second stage was the transfer of the station into a orbit. This was achieved with two burns of the Progress M1-5's control engines at 00:32 UTC and 02:01 UTC on 23 March 2001. After a two-orbit pause, the third and final stage of \"Mir\"'s deorbit began with the firing of Progress M1-5's control engines and main engine at 05:08 UTC, lasting a little over 22 minutes. The atmospheric re-entry at the altitude of occurred at 05:44 UTC near Nadi, Fiji.\n\nAfter the construction of the International Space Station began in 1998, Russian resources were split between the two stations. In 2000, Rosaviakosmos signed an agreement with MirCorp to lease the station for commercial use, with the Soyuz TM-30 mission, intended to prepare the station for future use and conduct some commercial research, being flown later that year. This was to have been followed by more missions, including flights with space tourists. Due to the Russian government being concerned about MirCorp's ability to fund these missions, Rosaviakosmos decided against funding the continued operation of \"Mir\".\n\nIn November 2000, Rosaviakosmos decided to deorbit \"Mir\", and the next month Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov signed an order to do so. By this stage \"Mir\" was well past the end of its design life, and Rosaviakosmos General Director Yuri Koptev believed that \"any of its systems could well fail at any time\". Therefore, it was decided to deorbit it while it was still functioning rather than risk it falling back to Earth out of control, like Skylab in 1979 and Salyut 7 in 1991, potentially dropping debris over a populated area.\n\nThe Mir Deorbit Monitoring Group, whose members were located in the Russian Mission Control Center (RMCC) and ESOC, was monitoring the whole dynamic phase of operation. Both RMCC control rooms in Moscow were used for the massive media presence during the final stages of operation. Real-time reports from RMCC were provided via teleconference during each deorbit burn to ESA spokespersons and representatives from national agencies. Video transmissions from RMCC were also made available to ESOC.\n\nTwo out of three Progress M1-5 propulsion firings, at approximately 90 minute intervals, were used to bring the perigee of \"Mir\" down to an altitude of above the Earth's surface. A tough contact with the atmosphere occurred at altitude, when some of the external light elements of \"Mir\" were torn off due to the rush through the rarefied air. At an altitude of sufficient heating from \"Mir\" hull created a glowing halo of hot plasma. At about that time, the orbital complex broke apart and several of \"Mir\"'s elements, surrounded by the plasma, were visible from Fiji against the evening sky. Television pictures were transmitted around the world within a few minutes of the event. The entire process lasted from about 16:20 to 20:29 local solar time. A short press conference was held in RMCC to cover the final stage of deorbit.\n\nAn official statement announced that \"Mir\" \"ceased to exist\" at 05:59:24 GMT. The final tracking of \"Mir\" was conducted by a United States Army site on Kwajalein Atoll. The European Space Agency, German Federal Ministry of Defence and U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration also assisted with tracking \"Mir\" during its final orbit and reentry.\n\nAt the time, \"Mir\" was the largest spacecraft ever to reenter the Earth's atmosphere, and there were concerns that sizeable pieces of debris, particularly from the docking assemblies, gyrodynes and external structure, could survive reentry. Amid debris fall, New Zealand issued international warnings to ships and aircraft traveling in the South Pacific area. Deputy director of New Zealand's Maritime Safety Authority, Tony Martin, said that the chances of debris hitting ships would be very small. A similar situation occurred in Japan, whose residents were warned to stay indoors during the forty-minute period when debris was most likely to fall. The local officials admitted that the chances of an accident were very low. The location of \"Mir\" announced after re-entry was in the South Pacific Ocean. The debris spread about ± along track and ± laterally, reduced from the earlier estimate due to the steeper re-entry angle.\n\n"}
{"id": "633062", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=633062", "title": "Docking (dog)", "text": "Docking (dog)\n\nDocking is the removal of portions of an animal's tail. While docking and bobbing are more commonly used to refer to removal of the tail, the term cropping is used in reference to the ears. Tail docking occurs in one of two ways. The first involves constricting the blood supply to the tail with a rubber ligature for a few days until the tail falls off. The second involves the severance of the tail with surgical scissors or a scalpel. The length to which tails are docked varies by breed, and is often specified in the breed standard.\n\nAt least 170 dog breeds have naturally occurring bobtail lines. These appear similar to docked dogs but are a distinct naturally occurring phenotype.\n\nHistorically, tail docking was thought to prevent rabies, strengthen the back, increase the animal's speed, and prevent injuries when ratting, fighting, and baiting. In early Georgian times in the United Kingdom a tax was levied upon working dogs with tails, so many types of dog were docked to avoid this tax. The tax was repealed in 1796 but that did not stop the practice from persisting.\n\nTail docking is done in modern times either for prophylactic, therapeutic, or cosmetic purposes. For dogs that work in the field, such as some hunting dogs, herding dogs, or terrier dogs, tails can collect burrs and foxtails, causing pain and infection and, due to the tail's wagging, may be subject to abrasion or other injury while moving through dense brush or thickets. Bones in the tail can be broken by impact in the field, causing spinal injury to the tail, or terriers can become stuck underground, necessitating being pulled out by the tail, in which case the docked tail protects the dog from spinal injury or trauma.\n\nDocking of puppies younger than 10 to 14 days old is routinely carried out by both breeders and veterinarians without anesthesia. Opponents of these procedures state that most tail dockings are done for aesthetic reasons rather than health concerns and are unnecessarily painful for the dog. They point out that even non-working show or pet dogs are routinely docked. As a result, tail defects that docking proponents claim makes docking necessary in the first place are perpetuated in the breeds. They point to the many breeds of working dogs with long tails that are not traditionally docked, including English Pointers, Setters, Herding dogs, and Foxhounds. \n\nRobert Wansborough argued in a 1996 paper\nthat docking tails puts dogs at a disadvantage in several ways. First, dogs use their tails to communicate with other dogs (and with people); a dog without a tail might be significantly handicapped in conveying fear, caution, aggression, playfulness, and so on.\n\nCertain breeds use their tails as rudders when swimming, and possibly for balance when running, so active dogs with docked tails might be at a disadvantage compared to their tailed peers. In 2007, Stephen Leaver, a graduate student at the University of Victoria, published a paper on tail docking which found that tail length was important in the transmission of social cues. The study found that dogs with shorter tails (docked tails) would be approached with caution, as if the approaching dog was unsure of the emotional state of the docked dog. The study goes on to suggest that dogs with docked tails may grow up to be more aggressive. The reasoning postulated by Tom Reimchen, UVic Biologist and supervisor of the study, was that dogs who grew up without being able to efficiently transmit social cues would grow up to be more anti-social and thus more aggressive.\n\nWansborough also investigated seven years of records from an urban veterinary practice to demonstrate that undocked tails result in less harm than docked tails.\n\nCritics point out that kennel clubs with breed standards that do not make allowance for uncropped or undocked dogs put pressure on owners and breeders to continue the practice. Although the American Kennel Club (AKC) says that it has no rules that require docking or that make undocked animals ineligible for the show ring, standards for many breeds put undocked animals at a disadvantage for the conformation show ring. The American breed standard for boxers, for example, recommends that an undocked tail be \"severely penalized.\"\n\nThe AKC position is that ear cropping and tail docking are \"acceptable practices integral to defining and preserving breed character and/or enhancing good health,\" even though the practice is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.\n\nToday, many countries ban cropping and docking because they consider the practices unnecessary, painful, cruel or mutilation. In Europe, the cropping of ears is prohibited in all countries that have ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals. Some countries that ratified the convention made exceptions for tail docking.\n\nShow dogs are no longer docked in the United Kingdom. A dog docked before 28 March 2007 in Wales and 6 April 2007 in England may continue to be shown at all shows in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland throughout its life. A dog docked on, or after, the above dates, regardless of where it was docked, may not be shown at shows in England and Wales where the public is charged a fee for admission. Where a working dog has been docked in England and Wales under the respective regulations, however, it may be shown where the public is charged a fee, so long as it is shown “only to demonstrate its working ability”. It will thus be necessary to show working dogs in such a way as to demonstrate their working ability and not conformity to a standard. A dog legally docked in England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or abroad may be shown at any show in Scotland or Northern Ireland.\n\nIn England and Wales, ear cropping is illegal, and no dog with cropped ears can take part in any Kennel Club event (including agility and other non-conformation events). Tail docking is also illegal, except for a few working breeds; this exemption applies only when carried out by a registered veterinary surgeon.\n\nThe Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons (RCVS), the regulatory body for veterinary surgeons in the United Kingdom, has stated they consider tail docking to be \"an unjustified mutilation and unethical unless done for therapeutic or acceptable prophylactic reasons\". In 1995 a veterinary surgeon was brought before the RCVS disciplinary council for \"disgraceful professional conduct\" for carrying out cosmetic docking. The surgeon claimed that the docking was performed to prevent future injuries, and the case was dismissed for lack of evidence otherwise. Although cosmetic docking is still considered unacceptable by the RCVS, no further disciplinary action has been taken against vets performing docking.\n\nThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 makes the docking of dogs' tails a criminal offence, except for working dogs such as those used by the police force, the military, rescue services, pest control, and those used in connection with lawful animal shooting. Three options were presented to Parliament in March 2006 with Parliament opting for the second:\n\nThose convicted of unlawful docking are liable to a fine of up to £20,000, up to 51 weeks of imprisonment or both.\n\nIn Northern Ireland legislation known as Welfare of Animals Act (Northern Ireland) 2011 made tail docking illegal except for certain working dogs. .\n\nIn Scotland docking of any breed is illegal. The Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 contains provisions prohibiting the mutilation of domesticated animals. However, the Scottish Government has carried out a consultation on this issue and have declared that they intend to legislate to bring the law in Scotland in line with the law in England and Wales, meaning that there will be an exemption for certain breeds of working dogs. This is due to the increase in serious spinal trauma reported in field dogs with undocked tails. \n\n\n EFRA - A.D.A. submission https://web.archive.org/web/20110126050347/http://www.anti-dockingalliance.co.uk/page_18.htm\n\n\n\n"}

Ginastera composed the opera on commission from the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first performance was at the Teatro Colón, Buenos Aires, Argentina on 24 July 1964 with Carlo Cossutta in the title role. The production was directed by Jorge Petraglia and conducted by Bruno Bartoletti.\n\nOn February 22, 1966, Plácido Domingo had his international breakthrough by singing the title role of this opera at the US premiere of the work by the New York City Opera. Other cast members included Jeannine Crader as Florinda, Spiro Malas as Teudiselo, the king's tutor, and David Clatworthy as Don Julian, Florinda's father. Julius Rudel conducted, and the opera received 9 performances at New York City Opera. In November 1967 the production was also given, still with Plácido Domingo, on tour at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. Ginastera prepared from the opera a concert work for soprano and orchestra, which received its own first performance in October 1964.\n\nMalena Kuss has published a detailed study of Ginastera's use of motives and of Argentine musical idioms in the opera. Pola Suares Urtubey has published an analysis of the dramatic structure of the opera.\n\n\nThe setting is Toledo, Spain in the 8th century. A note is that Don Rodrigo is also the Spanish name for Roderic, the last Visigothic king of Spain. The three acts of the opera are divided into nine scenes linked by interludes, with labeling of the scenes as follows:\n\n\"Act I\"\n\n\"Act II\"\n\n\"Act III\"\n\nThe scenes mirror each other in a format resembling a dramatic palindrome, with Scene 1 mirrored in Scene 9, Scene 2 mirrored in Scene 8, and so on, with Scene 5 forming the dramatic climax and fulcrum of the story.\n\nAt the start, Don Rodrigo has avenged an attack on his father. He is then about to be crowned King of Spain. Don Julian, Governor of Ceuta in Africa, introduces the King to his daughter Florinda. Rodrigo promises Don Julian that he will look after her as a daughter if she is permitted to stay at the royal court. At the coronation of Rodrigo, Florinda drops the crown. Although some regard this accident as a baleful sign, Rodrigo then retrieves the crown and places it on his own head. Historically, a chest in the Vault of Hercules has contained a locked mystery, which every King of Spain has respected since ancient times. However, Rodrigo opens the locked chest, where he sees the secret in the form of an Arab flag and a curse. The curse states that he who has opened the chest will be the last of his dynasty and that the Arabs will enslave Spain.\n\nLater, Florinda bathes in a fountain, which Rodrigo sees. He goes to Florinda’s bedroom at night, and forces himself on her. Rodrigo then abandons her. Florinda writes to her father, angrily calling for revenge on Rodrigo. \n\nDon Julian raises a rebellion against Don Rodrigo. At the battle at Guadalete, Don Julian is victorious against Don Rodrigo, which allows the Moors to enter Spain, fulfilling that part of the curse. Rodrigo becomes a penniless vagrant, and eventually finds shelter with a blind hermit. Florinda eventually discovers Rodrigo there. Rodrigo confesses his sins, and finally dies in Florinda's embrace.\n\n\n"}

Aristotle's \"Politics\" several times draws for examples on the internal government of Epidamnos, which was run as a tight oligarchy that appointed a ruling magistrate; tradesmen and craftsmen were excluded from power, until internal strife produced a more democratic government. The exiled oligarchs appealed to Corcyra while the democrats enlisted the help of Corinth, initiating a struggle between the two mother cities described by Thucydides as a cause of the Peloponnesian War. Individual trading with the local Illyrians was forbidden at Epidamnos: all traffic was through the authorized city agent or \"poletes\". In the fourth century BC the city-state was part of the kingdoms of Cassander and Pyrrhus. The general vicinity of Epidamnus was called Epidamnia.\n\nIn 229 BC, when the Romans seized the city the \"-damnos\" part of the name was inauspicious to Latin ears, and its name, as it was refounded, became Dyrrhachium. Pausanias (6.x.8) says \"the modern Roman city is not the ancient one, being at a short distance from it. The modern city is called Dyrrhachium from its founder.\" The name \"Dyrrachion\" is found on coins of the fifth century BC; in the Roman period \"Dyrrachium\" was more common. However, the city maintained a semi-autonomy and was turned into a Roman colony.\n\nDyrrachium was the landing place for Roman passengers crossing the Ionian Sea from Brundisium, which made it a fairly busy way-station. Here commenced the Via Egnatia, the Roman military road to Thessalonica that connected Roman Illyria with Macedonia and Thrace. The city itself was part of Macedonia, more specifically Epirus Nova. In 48 BC Pompey was based at Dyrrachium and beat off an attack by Julius Caesar (see Battle of Dyrrhachium). In AD 345 the city was levelled by an earthquake and rebuilt on its old foundations.\n\nIn the 4th century AD, Dyrrachium was made the capital of the Roman province of Epirus nova. Thus its Archbishopric became the Metropolitan of all dioceses in the province.\n\nThe name \"Epidamnos\" was still used by the Byzantines, as for example in the 13th-century \"Synopsis Chronike\", referring to contemporary events.\n\nThe modern city of Durrës is built directly over the ancient site, so it is primarily on the basis of inscriptions and serendipitous finds that some idea of its monuments has been formed. Inscriptions offer evidence on the following Roman monuments: an aqueduct constructed by Hadrian and restored by Alexander Severus bears a dedicatory inscription at Arapaj, a short distance from Durazzo: (\"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum\" III, 1-709); the Roman temple of Minerva; the Temple of Diana (\"CIL\" III, 1-602), which is perhaps the one mentioned by Appian (\"BCiv\". 2.60); the equestrian statue of L. Titinius Sulpicianus (\"CIL\" III, 1-605); the library (\"CIL\" m, 1-67). The last inscription mentions that for the dedication of the library 24 gladiators fought in pairs. The conjecture that there was an amphitheater in the city is confirmed by a passage from the fifteenth-century \"Vita di Skanderbeg\" by Marin Barleti: \"amphitheatrum mira arte ingenioque constructum\".\n\nAs a result of occasional discoveries, the following data are available: a 3rd-century mosaic pavement with a female head surrounded by garlands of vegetables and flowers, which brings to mind those painted on Apulian vases; remains of houses covered by other layers, the lowest of which, of the Greek era, was found at a depth of 5 m.\n\nColumns with Corinthian capitals and sections of finished marble revetment, discovered on the nearby hillside at Stani, belong probably to the Temple of Minerva or to the Capitolium. In the necropolis east of the hills that stand above the city have been found a stele of Lepidia Salvia, a sarcophagus with a scene of the Calydonian Boar hunt (now at Istanbul), and numerous Roman tombs.\n\nClassical sources not mentioned in the text: Strabo 5.283; 6.316,323,327; Ptolemy 3.12; Dio Cassius. 41.49; Pomponius Mela 2.56; Pliny \"Natural History\" 3.145; 4.36; 6.217; 14.30; 19.144; 32.18. \"CIL\" refers to the series of published inscriptions \"Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum.\"\n\n\n"}

A career fighter pilot, he served in the Korean War, the Cold War and the Vietnam War.\n\nCherry was born March 24, 1928, in Suffolk, Virginia into a poor farming family. He attended racially segregated public schools there. In 1951, Cherry graduated from Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nOn June 29, 1951, after his college graduation, Cherry enlisted in the Aviation Cadet Training Program of the U.S. Air Force, and was commissioned a second lieutenant. He was awarded his pilot wings at Webb Air Force Base in Texas on October 25, 1952.\n\nCherry was soon serving in the Korean War, where he flew F-84 Thunderjets on more than 100 combat missions, with the 58th Fighter-Bomber Wing, which was stationed at Taegu Air Base in South Korea\n\nDuring a combat mission on October 22, 1965, Cherry's F-105 Thunderchief fighter-bomber was shot down over North Vietnam. Cherry ejected and landed with a broken ankle and wrist, and a crushed shoulder. He was immediately captured by North Vietnamese militia.\n\nCherry was the first and highest ranking black officer among U.S. Prisoners of War during the Vietnam War. According to Cherry, his North Vietnamese captors wanted him to make public statements about racial intolerance in the United States, but he refused. As a result, Cherry spent 702 days in solitary confinement and was tortured or placed in punishment for 93 days in a row. Cherry's jailers placed U.S. pilot Ensign Porter Halyburton, a Southern white man, in Cherry's cell in the hopes that the two men would become antagonists. Instead, the two pilots helped each other to survive confinement and became very good friends. After seven years as a prisoner of war, Cherry was released from captivity on February 12, 1973. Cherry told the story of his POW's experience to Wallace Terry.\n\nAfter returning home, Cherry discovered that his wife, Shirley Brown, had taken all of his life savings after the Air Force declared him missing in action and started dating another man. Cherry started legal proceedings with the Air Force to have back salary and other payments returned to him.\n\nAfter Vietnam, Cherry attended the National War College and was assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency. He retired from the Air Force with over 30 years of service on 1 September 1981.\n\nIn 1982, the United States Court of Claims found the Air Force negligent in handling Cherry's military pay and awarded him $38,449 in compensation. At the time of the award, Cherry stated that he would contest the decision, saying that he wanted more of the $129,000 that his wife had received from the Air Force.\n\nFollowing his retirement from active duty, President Ronald Reagan commissioned Cherry to serve on the Korean War Veterans Memorial Advisory Board.\n\nCherry also served as the Director of Technical Support Services for E.H. White & Co. and as Marketing Manager for Data Transformation Corp. Most recently, Cherry has served as Chief Executive Officer for Cherry Engineering and Support Services, and as Director of SilverStar Consulting.\n\nCherry died of cardiac disease on February 16, 2016 at a hospital in Washington, D.C. He is buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nA school named after Cherry, Colonel Fred Cherry Middle School, scheduled to open in the Fall of 2018, will seat 800 students.

{"id": "1232201", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1232201", "title": "From Hell letter", "text": "From Hell letter\n\nThe \"From Hell\" letter (also called the \"Lusk letter\") is a letter that was posted in 1888 along with half a human kidney by a person who claimed to be the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, who killed and mutilated at least five female victims in the Whitechapel area of London over a period of several months. The exact number of victims has never been proven, and the identity of the perpetrator has remained unsolved.\n\nThe letter was postmarked on 15 October 1888 and was received the following day by George Lusk, the chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. It was accompanied by a preserved section of a human kidney; the letter's writer claimed to have eaten the other half. The police received a large number of letters claiming to be from the murderer, at one point having to deal with an estimated 1,000 letters related to the case, but the \"From Hell\" message is one of the few that has received serious attention as possibly being genuine. Opinions on the matter have remained divided. Several fictional works have referred to the Lusk letter, an example being the thriller novel \"Dust and Shadow\".\n\nThe letter read: \n\nThe original letter and the kidney which accompanied it have been lost, along with other items that were contained in the Ripper police files. The image shown here is from a photograph.\n\nThe news media reacted with alarm at the fact that a multiple murderer was on the loose; the 31 August 1888 death of Mary Ann Nichols resulted in numerous articles about the individual known as \"Leather Apron\" or \"the Whitechapel murderer\". The grotesque mutilation of Nichols and later victims were generally described as involving their bodies \"ripped up\" and residents spoke of their worries of a \"ripper\" or \"high rip\" gang. However, the identification of the killer as \"Jack\" the Ripper did not take place until after 27 September, when the offices of Central News Ltd received the \"Dear Boss\" letter. The message's writer listed Jack the Ripper as his \"trade name\" and vowed to continue killing until arrested, also threatening to send the ears of his next victim to the police.\n\nWhile the newsmen considered the letter a mere joke, they decided after two days to notify Scotland Yard of the matter. The double murder of Elizabeth Stride and Catherine Eddowes took place the night that the police received the \"Dear Boss\" letter. The Central News people received a second communication known as the \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard on 1 October 1888, the day after the double murder, and the message was duly passed over to the authorities. Copies of both messages were soon posted to the public in the hopes that the writing style would be recognised. While the police felt determined to discover the author of both messages, they found themselves overwhelmed by the media circus around the Ripper killings and soon received a large amount of material, most of it useless.\n\nHundreds of letters claiming to be from the killer were posted at the time of the Ripper murders, but many researchers argue that the \"From Hell\" letter is one of a handful of possibly authentic writings received from the murderer. Its author did not sign it with the \"Jack the Ripper\" pseudonym, distinguishing it from the earlier \"Dear Boss\" letter and \"Saucy Jacky\" postcard, as well as their many imitators. The handwriting is also similar in the earlier two messages but dissimilar in the one \"From Hell\". The letter was delivered to Lusk personally without reference to the police or to the British government, which could indicate animosity toward Lusk or toward the local Whitechapel community of which he was a member.\n\nThe \"From Hell\" letter is written at a much lower literacy level than the other two, featuring numerous errors in spelling and grammar. Scholars have debated whether this is a deliberate misdirection, as the author observed the silent \"k\" in \"knif\" and \"h\" in \"while\". The formatting of the letter also features a cramped writing style in which letters are pressed together haphazardly; many ink blots appear in a manner which might indicate that the writer was unfamiliar with using a pen. The formatting of the message might point to it being a hoax by a well-educated individual, but some researchers have argued that it is the genuine work of a partly functional but deranged individual.\n\nOpinions of those that have looked into the case are divided. The possibility has been raised that all of the communications supposedly from the Whitechapel murderer are fraudulent, acts done by cranks or by journalists seeking to increase the media frenzy even more. Scotland Yard had reason to doubt the validity of the latter yet ultimately did not take action against suspected reporters. However, the many differences between the \"From Hell\" letter and vast majority of the messages received has been cited by some figures analysing the case, such as a forensic handwriting expert interviewed by the History Channel and another interviewed by the Discovery Channel, as evidence to view it as maybe the only authentic letter.\n\nThe primary reason this letter stands out more than any other is that it was delivered with a small box containing half of what doctors later determined was a human kidney, preserved in spirits. One of murder victim Catherine Eddowes' kidneys had been removed by the killer. Medical opinion at the time was that the organ could have been acquired by medical students and sent with the letter as part of a hoax. Lusk himself believed that this was the case and did not report the letter until he was urged to do so by friends.\n\nArguments in favour as to the letter's genuineness sometimes state that contemporary analysis of the kidney by Dr. Thomas Openshaw of the London Hospital found that it came from a sickly alcoholic woman who had died within the past three weeks, evidence that it belonged to Eddowes. However, these facts have been in dispute as contemporary media reporting at the time as well as later recollections give contradictory information about Openshaw's opinions. Historian Philip Sugden has written that perhaps all that can be concluded given the uncertainty is that the kidney was human and from the left side of the body.\n\nA contemporary police lead found that shopkeeper Emily Marsh had encountered a visitor at her shop, located in London's Mile End Road, with an odd, unsettling manner in both his appearance and speech. The visitor asked Marsh for the address of Mr. Lusk, which he wrote in a personal notebook, before abruptly leaving. He was described as a slim man wearing a long black overcoat at about six feet in height that spoke with an Irish accent, his face featuring a dark beard and mustache. While the event took place the day before Lusk received the \"From Hell\" message and occurred in the area in which it is considered to have been postmarked, the fact that Lusk received so many hoax letters during this time means that the suspicious individual may have been another crank.\n\nForensic handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold, working for the History Channel documentary series \"MysteryQuest\", has argued that the letter is genuine based on the peculiar characteristics of the handwriting, particularly the \"invasive loop\" letter \"y\"s. The criminal profiling experts in the program also created a profile of the killer, stating that he possessed a deranged animosity towards women and skills at using a knife. Based on linguistic clues (including the use of the particular spelling of the word \"prasarved\" (preserved), Dresbold felt that the letter showed strong evidence that the writer was Irish or of Irish extraction, linking the letter to Ripper suspect Francis Tumblety. Tumblety was an itinerant Irish-American quack doctor who was mentally ill and who had resided in London during the year of the murders. He had multiple encounters with the law and a strong dislike of women, as well as a background collecting body parts. However, after arresting him at the time as a suspect, the police ended up releasing him on bail, having failed to find hard evidence against him. He ultimately died of a heart condition in the U.S. in 1903. Sugden has also written that the author may have had an Irish background but also stated that he may have had Cockney mannerisms.\n\nThe purported diary of James Maybrick, another man who has been proposed as a Ripper suspect, contains references to the \"From Hell\" letter, particularly the alleged cannibalism. However, even if the diary is assumed to be genuine, the handwriting does not match that of the letter at all. A \"Kirkus Reviews\" article has referred to the diary rumor as a \"hoax\" that is one of several \"bizarre hypotheses\" relating to the case.\n\nThe Jack the Ripper murders are regarded as the first internationally publicised set of serial killings, with the perpetrator never conclusively identified. They have attracted much attention for decades, with fictional works referring specifically to the Lusk letter. The graphic novel \"From Hell\" about the Ripper murders takes its name from the letter, created by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell. The work was originally published in serial form from 1989 to 1996, first collected as a single piece in 1999, and adapted into a 2001 feature film starring Johnny Depp and Heather Graham. The comic series features the actual killer as a main protagonist, going into his tortured mind and warped justifications for the murders. Cultural commentators such as Professor Elizabeth Ho have highlighted the way in which the work comments \"on the present's relationship to the past\", with text and image placed \"in critical tension\".\nLyndsay Faye's thriller novel \"\" pits Sherlock Holmes against the Whitechapel murderer. The mobile video game \"Jack the Ripper: Letters from Hell\" was released in 2010 by Anuman.\n\n"}
{"id": "50687753", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50687753", "title": "GLOW (TV series)", "text": "GLOW (TV series)\n\nGLOW is an American comedy web television series created by Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch. The series revolves around a fictionalization of the characters and gimmicks of the 1980s syndicated women's professional wrestling circuit, the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (or GLOW) founded by David McLane. The first season consists of 10 episodes and was released via Netflix on June 23, 2017. On August 10, 2017, Netflix renewed the series for a second season of 10 episodes, which premiered on June 29, 2018. The series was renewed for a third season on August 20, 2018.\n\nIn Los Angeles in 1985, Ruth Wilder, a struggling actress, auditions along with many other women in a fledgling professional wrestling promotion called the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling (GLOW). She is at odds with GLOW's director Sam Sylvia due to her tendency to overact. When Ruth's former best friend, retired soap opera actress Debbie Eagan, arrives at the ring, their confrontation promises either to make or break the show.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to Kia Stevens (who has wrestled as Awesome Kong in TNA, and as Kharma in WWE) in a recurring role, several professional wrestlers made cameos throughout the season. These include John Hennigan as Salty \"The Sack\" Johnson, a trainer who appeared in the first episode; Tyrus and Carlos Edwin, who played Carmen's wrestler brothers; Joey Ryan as a wrestler known as \"Mr. Monopoly\", and Ryan's real-life wife and wrestler Laura James played his valet, \"Crystal\"; Alex Riley played a wrestler known as \"Steel Horse\"; Brooke Hogan as night club manager Amber Fredrickson; Chavo Guerrero Jr. as Chico Guapo; and Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian as unnamed wrestlers. Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and Gorgeous George appear in archived video footage in episodes 1 and 4.\n\nThe idea for the series came when Flahive and Mensch, who at the time were looking to make a new female-centric show, came across the 2012 documentary \"\". Before this, neither woman had heard of the GLOW wrestling promotion, and they became intrigued by the premise of producing a fictionalized version of it. Both women found the storyline intriguing as a way of exploring the aftermath of the 1970s Woman's Liberation Movement, with Flahive telling \"Rolling Stone\", \"We wanted to look back on the 1970s, coming out of the women's movement, and into the 1980s, and ask the question: Did it work? Did things get better?\" To this end, it was important for the series to maintain a tension between whether the league was exploiting women or empowering them.\n\nUrsula Hayden, the owner of the GLOW company, served as a consultant on the series and helped Flahive and Mensch with creating the show. Hayden was also on the original 1980s promotion as Babe, the Farmer's Daughter.\n\nChavo Guerrero, Jr. of the famous Guerrero wrestling family also served as a consultant on the series and helped train the actresses. His uncle Mando Guerrero had served in the same role for the original series.\n\nThe series was shot on several locations in Los Angeles; mainly in the San Fernando Valley. Chavo's Boxing Gym, which is GLOW's training grounds, was a combination of two locations: the interior was a studio set while the exterior was the rear of the San Fernando Masonic Lodge. The Pink Motel in Sun Valley was used as a stand-in for The Dusty Spur Motel, GLOW's sleeping quarters. Other notable locations include the Mayan Theater and the Hollywood Palladium.\n\nPrincipal production on season 2 commenced in October 2017.\n\nFor the Spain Market, Netflix España released a series of promo videos featuring singers Marta Sánchez and Vicky Larraz. The first video, titled \"No Controles\", features Sánchez imitating Ruth's imaginary wrestler scene from the first episode. The second video has Sánchez and Larraz squaring off in the ring.\n\nFor the Brazil market, Netflix Brasil released a promo video featuring singers Gretchen and Rita Cadillac auditioning for GLOW.\n\nFunko will release Pop! Vinyl figures of Ruth and Debbie in mid-2018.\n\nThe series features several songs from the 1980s, as well as tracks from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. The episode 1 opening theme for Seasons 1-2 is \"The Warrior\" by Scandal.\n\n\n\nQuiet Riot's cover of \"Cum On Feel the Noize\" was used for the Season 1 trailer, while \"Maniac\" by Michael Sembello was used for the Season 2 trailer. Songs covered by the cast include the Thompson Twins' \"Hold Me Now\" and Barbra Streisand's \"This Is One of Those Moments\".\n\n\"GLOW\" was praised by critics upon its release; with Season 1 receiving a 95% approval rating from review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes, the site's consensus being \"With spot-on 1980s period detail, knockout writing, and a killer cast, \"GLOW\" shines brightly.\" Season 2 has a 98% approval rating, the site's consensus being \" Fearlessly led by its excellent ensemble, \"GLOW\"s second season adds a new layer of drama without sacrificing its self-effacing, delightfully silly humor.\" The series has a Metacritic score of 81 out of 100, based on 37 critics. Darren Franich of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the first season an A rating, calling it \"a silly-smart masterpiece, with an ensemble cast entirely made up of breakout characters\". Sophie Gilbert of \"The Atlantic\" said, \"...it’s just a blast to watch women having so much fun. \"GLOW\" fully owns its campiness and its showy aesthetics, but it’s smart and subversive underneath the glitter.\"\n\nThe series received mixed reactions from some of the original GLOW wrestlers. Jeanne Basone, who wrestled in the promotion as \"Hollywood\", commented that \"Some of the training and the gym and the outfits they get correct.\" Patricia Summerland, who played \"Sunny the California Girl\" in the promotion, saw Marc Maron's character Sam Sylvia as a stark contrast to original GLOW director Matt Cimber. Eileen O'Hara, who was known as \"Melody Trouble Vixen (MTV)\", felt that the series did not properly represent the promotion. Lisa Moretti, who competed as \"Tina Ferrari\" and would go on to the greatest fame among GLOW alumni as Ivory in the WWF/WWE as a three-time WWF Women's Champion during the Attitude Era, said that she was relieved that the series isn't a documentary because it was more entertaining to have a mix between fact and fiction.\n\nMore positive reception came from mainstream wrestling figures including Kurt Angle. Ethan Sapienza of \"Slate\" noted accurate comparisons between the series and WWE as well as the various regional promotions that made up the National Wrestling Alliance during its heyday.\n\n"}

It was first planted in 1928 by Associate Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, and replaced several times in the 1930s. Blooming in late spring at the end of the academic year, it became closely associated with examination time at the university. It has formed the background to many events, and the original tree was on the City of Sydney's Significant Tree Register. On 28 October 2016, the old tree died after 88 years and fell over. On 20 July 2017, the University announced the replacement of the jacaranda with a genetically identical clone, and a native Illawarra flame tree in the opposite corner.\n\nThe tree was located in the corner of the quadrangle close to where Philosophy classes used to be held. It was planted by Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, who was McCaughey associate professor of German and comparative literature and also a camellia expert. His interest in horticulture and landscaping influenced the design of the gardens at the university. He is credited with turning the main quadrangle where the jacaranda grew \"from an unsightly mess into a dignified area\". Waterhouse continued to be engaged for many years on beautification schemes involving tree planting for the university, in the city beyond the university, as well as in other cities beyond Sydney. In an address given in Newcastle in 1936, Waterhouse said that \"beautification of urban and suburban areas ranked among the finest forms of community service\" and that in tree planting, the preservation of trees and the creative work were both important. In 1966 he received a gold medal from the Royal Horticultural Society, London.\n\nStories about the difficulty of establishing the tree circulated for many years. Students were blamed for several failed efforts after young trees were ripped out and frustrated Committee members passed \"motions deploring the actions of 'irresponsible vandals'\". Vandalism concerning the jacaranda was included in newspaper reports as late as 1939. An alternative view is that staff stole young trees for their own gardens. Eventually, the planting succeeded and over its life, the jacaranda grew to a width of 18 metres, becoming both \"grand\" and \"iconic\".\n\nSydney University's jacaranda formed the backdrop to many public and private events that took place in the quadrangle, including graduations and weddings. In the opinion of Mark Scott, it was \"the most famous tree in education\". The university's landscape and grounds manager said \"I don't think the quadrangle would be the space it is without that tree.\" \n\nThe tree was well-loved in spite of its association with the examination period in November when jacarandas all over Sydney come into flower. Accepted wisdom was that exam failure was inevitable for a student who had not yet begun to study by the time its purple blooms appeared.\n\nIn 2005 the jacaranda was added to the list of historic or environmentally significant trees in the City of Sydney as \"one of Sydney’s best known significant trees\". It was known as \"a living asset\". In 2012, the city's chief arborist placed it in the Register's Top 10. The trees on the Register are selected on the basis of their \"historical, cultural, social, ecological or outstanding visual and aesthetic appeal\". Other varieties of tree on the Register near to the university include Moreton Bay figs in Alexandria Park, Alexandria and Observatory Hill; Brush box trees in Avenue Road, Glebe; Washington palms in Farrer Place, Sydney; Plane trees on Bourke Street, Surry Hills; and Dragon's blood trees in Cook and Phillip Park.\n\nIn 2016 the tree died after 88 years, possibly of ganoderma fungus, and fell over on 28 October. It was cut up and removed the following day. The university issued a press release reminding students that the tree had begun to bloom and wished \"them all well for their final weeks of study for 2016\".\n\nThe university had been advised in 2014 that the original tree was nearing the end of its life. Aware of its significance, the university administration had taken cuttings and maintained three \"emergency\" specimens. The resulting clones would subsequently enable it to be replaced with genetically identical stock.\n\nIn July 2017 the cloned tree was replanted; the tree is a graft from the old tree on a jacaranda rootstock. The university also planted a native flame tree alongside the replacement jacaranda in recognition of the Gadigal people on whose traditional lands the university is located.\n\n"}

During the lepton epoch the temperature of the universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang the temperature of the universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created.

{"id": "13449450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13449450", "title": "Mladina", "text": "Mladina\n\nMladina is a Slovenian weekly left-wing current affairs magazine. Since the 1920s, when it was first published, it has become a voice of protest against those in power. Now it is printed weekly throughout the country and is considered one of the most influential political magazines in the country.\n\n\"Mladina\" was first founded in 1920 as the official herald of the Youth Section of the Yugoslav Communist Party in Slovenia. Thus, it was started as a youth magazine. After the prohibition of the Communist Party in 1921, the journal kept circulating in a semi-illegal position. During this period, it was the herald not only of Communists, but of the radical leftist and anti-capitalist youth in general. Famous figures such as the poet Srečko Kosovel, writer Ludvik Mrzel and historian France Klopčič published in the magazine. In the 1930s, during the dictatorship of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, the journal ceased to exist due to the repressive pressure of the authorities. It was re-established during World War II, in January 1943, as the journal of the underground anti-fascist resistance movement. After 1945, it was again transformed in the official herald of the Youth Section of the Communist Party of Slovenia.\n\nBy 1984, \"Mladina\" was in crisis. A new generation of editors then took charge and transformed the tired party journal into a teenager's fanzine, of which the sales at first rose to a modest 7,000 copies. However, the new image was not just a vehicle to cover pop events, and it soon became a political paper that was the voice of opposition. It gained immediate popularity. Revelations of corruption scandals in Slovenia drove the circulation up to 30,000.\n\nIn 1982, the Congress of the Alliance of Socialist Youth of Slovenia decided to transform \"Mladina\" by increasing its editorial autonomy and elevate it to the voice of the growing internal opposition of the young Communists against the mainstream of the Communist Party in Slovenia. Thus, by the late 1980s \"Mladina\"'s main focus became to promote democratic transformation through political criticism. It pursued its change in focus from youth culture to exposing political conflicts within Yugoslav society, including a critique of Josip Broz Tito's legacy, the Federal Government, the Communist Party and, especially, the Army. At the time, \"Mladina\" was monitored by the authorities because of its pacifist stance, manifested, among other things, in its firm opposition to Yugoslavia’s arms sales to developing countries.\n\nThe 2003 circulation of \"Mladina\" was 19,300 copies, making it the most read weekly in the country.\n\n\"Mladina\"s most controversial period was the spring of 1988 with the Ljubljana trial, also known as the \"Trial against the Four\" (\" proti četverici\") or simply as the JBTZ trial, after the initial of the four arrested men (Janša-Borštner-Tasić-Zavrl). In early 1984, in fact, four men were arrested and prosecuted for their handling of military documents found at \"Mladina\"s offices. These documents clarified acts of martial law, to be imposed in Slovenia in an emergency. One of the men arrested was the freelance journalist Janez Janša, at that time a prominent member of the League of Socialist Youth of Slovenia who had been expelled from the Communist Party of Slovenia in 1983 (he later became the Prime Minister of Slovenia). The others were two editors of the magazine, David Tasić and Franci Zavrl, and an army sergeant, Ivan Borštner. The arrest of two of its editors elicited strong protest, pushed the circulation to 70,000 and gave the magazine prominence across Yugoslavia in 1987–1988 at a time of differences between Slovenes and other groups in Yugoslavia. \"We are the official press, they the alternative\", claimed \"Mladina\" editors proudly and boldly at a congress on alternative youth culture in Southern Europe in Bologna in December 1988.\n\nThe subsequent trial held in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, was carried out in Serbo-Croatian rather than Slovene, and this caused much offense to many Slovenes. The trial was a unifying time for Slovenes prior to their separation from Yugoslavia and sparked protests around Ljubljana. Around 15,000 people joined a central Ljubljana protest in June of that year. As a result, the Committee for the Protection of Human Rights (CPHR) was set up.\n\n\"Mladina\"s deputy editor, Ali Žerdin has said that the magazine's contributors are not hostile to the government, but just sceptical journalists pushing the government to make better choices. For example, in 2003, as Slovenia was entering NATO, statements in \"Mladina\" led to accusations that it was anti-NATO. Žerdin defended the magazine by saying that the government would not consider a rebuff in the referendum a vote against NATO.\n\nReligion is also a frequent topic in \"Mladina\". The magazine has been critical of the Roman Catholic Church, such as its opposition to the rehabilitation of Gregorij Rožman, and has opposed the policies of the Slovenian cardinal Franc Rode, the Opus Dei and other conservative currents in the Church. It has also been accused of inciting anti-Catholic sentiment, most famously by the writer and essayist Drago Jančar in his essay \"Slovenian Marginalities\", published in 1999. In 2004, a controversy on whether or not Muslims should be allowed to build a mosque in Ljubljana broke out. Many of Slovenia's Muslims are first or second generation descendants of immigrant workers from other former Yugoslav regions (mostly Bosniaks and Albanians) and several chauvinist and right-wing groups have opposed the building of a mosque in Ljubljana, while \"Mladina\" fully supports its construction. However, in line with its liberal stance, \"Mladina\" was one of the few printed media in Slovenia that published the controversial cartoons of Mohammad in 2006.\n\n\"Mladina\" has had several prominent dedicated professionals. Ivo Standeker was a feature editor for \"Mladina\" working in Sarajevo when he was killed in June 1992.\n\nSeveral famous people have collaborated with the magazine during its history. They include: sociologist and musician Gregor Tomc, journalist and politician Janez Janša, philosopher Slavoj Žižek, philosopher and literary theorist Rastko Močnik, political theorist Tomaž Mastnak and Vlasta Jalušič, journalist Jurij Gustinčič, sociologist and publicist Bernard Nežmah, film critic Marcel Štefančič Jr., jurist and human rights activist Matevž Krivic, cartoonist Tomaž Lavrič, and many others.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "592571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=592571", "title": "Newport Folk Festival", "text": "Newport Folk Festival\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival is an American annual folk-oriented music festival in Newport, Rhode Island, which began in July 1959 as a counterpart to the previously established Newport Jazz Festival. The festival is often considered one of the first modern music festivals in America and remains a focal point in the ever-expanding genre of \"folk\" music.\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival was founded in 1959 by George Wein, founder of the already-well-established Newport Jazz Festival, and owner of Storyville, a jazz club located in Boston, MA. In 1958, Wein became aware of the growing Folk Revival movement and began inviting folk artists such as Odetta to perform on Sunday afternoons at Storyville. The afternoon performances consistently sold out and Wein began to consider the possibility of a \"folk afternoon embedded within the 1959 Newport Jazz Festival\". Wein envisioned the program to be \"similar in scope and tone to the highly successful blues and gospel shows\" that had taken place at the Jazz Festival in previous years. Wein asked Odetta, Pete Seeger, and the Weavers to perform on the afternoon in addition to the Kingston Trio. After conferring with the folk community, it grew abundantly clear to Wein that an afternoon program would not suffice and that there was demand for a full festival.\n\nAware of his own limitations in the folk scene, Wein asked Albert Grossman, then Odetta's manager, to join him in planning and producing the festival. Grossman accepted and began working with Wein to book talent and organize the weekend.\n\nThe inaugural festival lineup included Pete Seeger, Earl Scruggs, the Kingston Trio, John Jacob Niles, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, Odetta, The New Lost City Ramblers, and more. Perhaps the most notable performance was the surprise debut of the eighteen year old Joan Baez, who was brought on as a guest of Bob Gibson.\n\nThe festival returned in 1960 and was expanded to include three nights. The lineup placed an emphasis on music diversity, booking performers from Africa, Scotland, Spain, Israel, and Ireland alongside \"traditional\" folk musicians such as Pete Seeger, Ewan McColl, John Lee Hooker, Cisco Houston and Tommy Makem.\n\nIn 1962, two young members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) formed a gospel vocal quartet named the Freedom Singers. And in 1962, Pete and Toshi Seeger assisted the Freedom Singers in organizing a nationwide collegiate tour. As a result, the civil rights movement became deeply embraced by the folk music community. In 1963, the Freedom Singers performed on the first night of the Newport Folk festival, and on the second night Joan Baez joined SNCC activists and roughly 600 festival-goers on a march through Newport. The crowd walked past the Bellevue Avenue mansions and into Touro Park, where SNCC's executive secretary James Forman and Freedom Singers leader Cordell Reagon delivered speeches, rallying support for the March on Washington scheduled for the following March.\n\nFor the final performance on Friday Wein had scheduled Peter, Paul and Mary. But under the persuasion of Albert Grossman, who was managing Peter, Paul and Mary, Wein decided to allow Bob Dylan (whom Grossman was also managing) to close the night. After Peter, Paul and Mary finished their afternoon set, Wein announced that they would reappear at the end of the evening. Dylan performed a set consisting of particularly topical songs: \"With God on Our Side\", \"Talkin' John Birch Society Blues\", and \"A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall\". Peter, Paul and Mary then returned and performed an encore of \"Blowin' in the Wind\". Amidst a \"deafening roar of applause\" they brought to the stage Dylan, Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Theo Bikel and the Freedom Singers. The singers stood in a single line facing the audience with crossed arms and clasped hands and began to sing a variation on the Baptist hymn \"I'll Overcome Some Day\". The hymn's new incarnation - \"We Shall Overcome\" - had become an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement.\n\nIn 1928, Mississippi John Hurt, a self-taught amateur musician and farmer, recorded 13 songs for Okeh Records which failed to achieve commercial success. Believing his musical career to be over, Hurt continued farming, apparently thinking little of his brief recording gig.\n\nPost WWII, few records cut by southern musicians in the 1920s were commercially available. Hurt's records were particularly rare, since few had been manufactured in the first place. But Harry Smith, a member of a tiny subculture of obsessive, cranky collectors, put two John Hurt cuts on his influential 1952 Anthology of American Folk Music, prompting many blues hobbyists to begin searching for him. In 1963, Tom Hoskins and Mike Stewart acquired a tape of Hurt's Avalon Blues through their informal network of tape traders. Hurt had recorded Avalon Blues at the end of a week-long stay in New York that spanned Christmas 1928. Apparently homesick in the big city, Hurt included a line about his home in Avalon being always on his mind.\n\nHoskins and Stewart were able to locate Avalon and track Hurt down. After asking Hurt to perform, to ensure he was actually who he claimed to be, Hoskins convinced Hurt to move to Washington D.C. and embark on a national tour.\n\nThe tour culminated on Saturday evening of the 1963 Newport Folk Festival, when Mississippi John Hurt performed alongside Brownie McGhee, Sonny Terry and John Lee Hooker for a blues workshop at the Newport Casino. The performance is considered to be a seminal moment for the folk revival and caused Hurt to rise to fame. He performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.\n\nBob Dylan's 1963 and 1964 performances solo and with Baez had made him popular with the Newport crowd, but on July 25, 1965 festival headliner Dylan was booed by some fans when he played with backing band The Paul Butterfield Blues Band.\n\nIt is usually said that the reason for the hostile reception by a small number of fans was Dylan's \"abandoning of the folk orthodoxy, or poor sound quality on the night (or a combination of the two). The controversy regarding the reaction of the audience at this event is often overplayed, as it was not the general reaction of the audience, but rather that of a small number of folk \"purists\", including Pete Seeger. The reaction of \"the crowd\" to Dylan's performance, certainly from eyewitness accounts, was generally quite enthusiastic. This performance, Dylan's first live \"plugged-in\" set of his professional career, marked the shift in his artistic direction from folk to rock, and had wider implications for both genres. The performance marked the first time Dylan performed \"Like a Rolling Stone\" in public.\n\nDespite the musical transition, Dylan's growing status within the larger counterculture ensured that his place in the expanding movement would remain secure.\n\nDylan did not return to Newport until 2002, when he played a headlining performance while wearing a wig and fake beard.\n\nIn 1969, the Johnny Cash troupe was to perform on opening night of the festival. Cash had recently become aware of Kris Kristofferson, a young, relatively unknown country singer-songwriter, and convinced George Wein to allow Kristofferson to join him onstage. Kristofferson's performance of \"Me and Bobby McGee\" and other songs gave him a launch into his legendary musical career.\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival has, throughout various points in its history, remained connected to protest movements. In the 60's the festival played a substantial part in the civil rights movement. In the early 80's the Newport Folk Festival was one of the first festivals to serve as a platform for climate change protest.\nIn the 1990s, playing on Victory Day (originally \"Victory over Japan Day\" or \"V-J Day\") folk musician Michelle Shocked asked the entire audience to lie down because \"she wanted to see what it looked like when people had been destroyed by bombs\". This was relevant to the locale of the festival as Rhode Island is the only US state which still officially celebrates the holiday, and the Naval War College is also in Newport, a mere few miles from the Fort Adams State Park where the festival is held.\n\nIn 2002, Bob Dylan returned to the Newport Folk Festival for the first time since his shocking performance in 1965, in which he went electric. The '65 appearance at the Folk Festival was a turning point in his career, a distancing of himself from his acoustic folk music to his more blues-based electric music.\n\nDespite wide speculation that Dylan would once again attempt to \"shock\" the audience at Newport, Dylan performed a straightforward set, with little surprises. The performance was reviewed favorably and provided a much needed economic boost to the festival. \nInitially spanning the late eighties and early nineties, The Pixies are often credited for creating a blueprint for alternative rock that was followed and embellished upon by numerous contemporary indie/rock artists. After separating in 1994, the group reunited in 2004 and in 2005, performed, for the first time, a completely acoustic performance at the Newport Folk Festival. The set was deemed \"Pixies Go Acoustic\" as a play on words in reference to Bob Dylan going electric at the Newport Folk Festival is 1965.\n\nThe performance was recorded and turned into a feature film directed by Michael B Borofsky, titled Pixies: Acoustic: Live in Newport.\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival has existed in various forms since its creation; founded as a not-for-profit, the festival became a for-profit in the mid-eighties. However, in 2011, the festival announced it would return to its non-profit status under the umbrella of the Newport Festivals Foundation. The Foundation not only strived to sustain the Newport Folk and Newport Jazz Festival, but also expand the impact of its Festivals through educational initiatives that celebrate innovation while preserving the deep traditions inherent in Jazz and Folk music.\n\nIn 2008, Executive Producer, George Wein hired Jay Sweet as an associate of the festival. At the time, the folk festival was struggling financially and with Sweet's recommendations, the 2008 line-up varied drastically from previous years. Rock band the Black Crowes and Trey Anastasio, frontman of Phish, headlined and other artists on the bill included Stephen Marley and Damian Marley, sons of reggae icon Bob Marley. The Festival was well attended and received favorable press, despite folk purists questioning the modernization of the festival.\n\nSweet continued his unconventional and somewhat controversial style of booking artists that challenged the conservative definitions of folk music. With 2009 being the 50th anniversary of the festival, Sweet used the opportunity to book both modern and traditional folk acts; symbolizing the past and current styles of folk music. The success of the 2009 festival marked a turning point in the festival's history. In 2011 the two day festival sold out Saturday and in 2012 the festival sold out both days. In 2013 the festival expanded to three days and sold out both Saturday and Sunday. In 2014 the festival sold out all three days months in advance. The festival has sold out every year since.\n\nIn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Bob Dylan going electric at Newport, the Festival scheduled a program titled 65 Revisited on the final night of the 2015 festival. The program's details and performers were kept secret prior to the performance - prompting various rumors including the return of Bob Dylan.\n\nInstead, the program featured an array of more contemporary musicians, including Taylor Goldsmith of Dawes, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, Willie Watson, Hozier and Klara Soderberg of First Aid Kit, John McCauley and Ian O'Neil of Deer Tick, Robyn Hitchcock and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans. The ensemble performed a collection of Dylan's material, ending the performance with \"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35,\".\n\nIn recent years, the Newport Folk Festival has developed a reputation for selling out of tickets before announcing the lineup. Unlike most festivals, the festival \"rolls out\" their lineup over the course of the year instead of releasing a lineup poster on one day. \nThe festival has also developed a reputation for programming surprise, unannounced artists. Past instances include the 65 Revisited program (2015), in which Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, Dawes, and Willie Watson appeared unannounced. Other surprise moments include My Morning Jacket (2015), James Taylor (2015), Kris Kristofferson (2016), Roger Waters (2017), and Mumford & Sons (2018). Like 65 Revisited in 2015, 2018's A Change Is Gonna Come closing set paired guests from the weekend with unannounced guests including Leon Bridges, Chris Thile, and Mavis Staples.\n\nThe Newport Folk Festival takes place every year at Fort Adams State Park, in Newport, Rhode Island. \nFort Adams houses four stages, the Fort Stage which sits looking out at Newport harbor and the famous Claiborne Pell Bridge, the Harbor Stage, The Quad Stage, and The Museum Stage. The festival is known for its beautiful setting- as the music blog Consequence of Sound puts it, \"Located at the gorgeously scenic Fort Adams, in Newport, Rhode Island, glimmering, clear blue water surrounds the small vivid green peninsula. Look out from the fort towers and you'll see hundreds of beautiful boats rocking along the water.\" (Consequence of Sound).\nMy Morning Jacket frontman Jim James told Spin Magazine, \"You've got the sun on your skin and the breeze in your hair. It's magical here... It's just magical.\" (SPIN at Newport Folk 2010) Brandi Carlile says \"It's one of my favorites so far if not my favorite.\" (Brandi Carlile Interview)\n\nWMVY began streaming the festival in 2005 and was joined by NPR Music in 2008. WMVY's Archives contains both performances and interviews from Newport Folk and NPR music has recorded sets available for listening here: NPR at Newport Folk 2010.\n\nThe festival has made efforts in being green-friendly, teaming with many groups to do so.\nThey partnered with Clean Water Action and Rhode Island Resource Recovery to collect 1.5 tons of recyclables. CWA worked onsite picking up trash and recycling, and set up composting stations to curb the waste generated during the event. A portion of beer and wine sales went to CWA to support their work.\nThe official beer of the festival, Vermont-based Magic Hat used plant-based, 100% compostable cups.\nThe festival also partnered with CLIF Bar, who set up a bike valet to encourage people to cycle to the event and participate in their 2-Mile Challenge.\nThey worked with New England Wind Fund to offset power used during the festival, and Klean Kanteen to provide reusable water bottles.\nThey also partnered with Farm Fresh Rhode Island to incorporate local foods into the vendors' fare.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotable past performers at the Newport Folk Festival include: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The city of Philadelphia was nearing the end of its golden age and the last first-class game for the team would be played only three years later. \n\nThe series began at Sabina Park in Kingston on 15 February with a two-day match. In spite of a solid first innings batting performance from William Newhall, the visitors only managed 93 runs. The Jamaican side needed only 12 runs in their second innings to win the match by nine wickets.

{"id": "31721582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31721582", "title": "Royal Pudding", "text": "Royal Pudding\n\n\"Royal Pudding\" is the third episode of the fifteenth season of the American animated television series \"South Park\" and 212th episode of the series over all. \"Royal Pudding\" premiered in the United States on Comedy Central on May 11, 2011. In the episode, which parodies the 2011 Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, the Prince of Canada's bride is abducted at the altar, leading Ike Broflovski to answer the call to rescue her. \"Royal Pudding\" was written and directed by series co-creator Trey Parker and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. The episode aired twelve days after the wedding.\n\nMr. Mackey is making the kindergarten students perform a play about tooth decay and the importance of dental hygiene. He is furious when Ike, who is supposed to portray tooth decay, misses a rehearsal to watch the Canadian royal wedding. During the ceremony, the princess is suddenly enclosed in a giant cube and spirited away. Ike is so distraught that he cannot stop crying during rehearsal and gets sent home by Mr. Mackey. People all over Canada kill themselves out of despair for the princess' abduction and a candlelight vigil is held where Rush performs a version of \"Candle in the Wind\". The Prime Minister of Canada instructs all people of Canadian descent to go home and open their \"Box of Faith\", which contains – along with a location beacon, a first aid kit, and a sandwich – a video recording issuing a call to arms for all Canadians in fighting condition to \"meet by the tree in Edmonton\". Ike answers the call and, while riding a bus to Canada, meets a fellow Canadian named Ugly Bob, who claims he has to wear a bag over his head because, even though he simply appears Canadian to Americans, other Canadians find his face frighteningly ugly.\n\nOnce the pair arrive, the first instinct of the member of the Canadian Armed Forces leading the gathered Canadians is that the princess was taken by a giant, who turns out to be Scott the Dick, who grew to seven feet tall – giant by Canadian standards – after a radioactive accident in Ottawa. When it turns out that Scott has been wrongly accused of taking the princess, most other Canadians go home, but Scott persuades Ike and Ugly Bob to follow him as he accuses the Inuit of kidnapping the princess out of his racial prejudice towards the \"Native Canadians\". The three of them travel to the Arctic tundra of northern Canada to get information from the Inuit, who admit that their people do have a grudge against the Canadians for taking their land, but tribe leader reveals that the princess' abduction was foretold, and that the true kidnapper is one who attacks people of all nationalities. With an Inuit mother leading the three, they find a large dark castle, where the princess is held captive by the abductor: Tooth Decay. Eventually, after the monster hurls Scott and the Inuit woman across the room, Ike turns Tooth Decay to stone by exposing Ugly Bob's face to him.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Mackey becomes increasingly irate with Ike's absence and blames it on Kyle, who fills Ike's role in the play. During rehearsals Mackey consistently loses his temper with the children for singing flat or without feeling, directing his most scathing remarks at Kyle, and reveals that the play means a great deal to him because Tooth Decay killed his father. While the play is a success with parents of the kindergartners, Mr. Mackey verbally abuses his actors' imperfections backstage until the police intervene, telling Mackey to cancel the play due to reports coming in from the Yukon that Tooth Decay is dead. Ike receives a knighthood from the Canadian princess, an honor that fails to impress any of the boys (with the exception of Kyle), and the royal wedding begins again. Both events (before and after the princess' abduction) involve bizarre traditions such as the prince putting his arms into a large bowl of butterscotch pudding, the princess scraping them clean and smearing the pudding on her own face, and the prince tearing one of her arms off and inserting it into his anus, \"as is tradition.\"\n\nAccording to the DVD commentary, series creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker found both the royal wedding and the hype surrounding it to be peculiar, stating, \"Whenever we talk about something no one cares about we make it about Canada.\" The kindergarten play rehearsals were based on the rehearsals for the \"Book of Mormon.\" The voices for the \"native Canadians\" were provided by Native Americans.\n\nIn its original American broadcast on May 11, 2011, \"Royal Pudding\" was seen by 2.435 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research.\n\nThe A.V. Club gave the episode a C-, citing its \"bric-a-brac construction\", and called it \"one of the strangest half-hours in the show's history\". It was deemed \"pointedly silly\", \"polarizing\", and hence \"bound to be divisive\".\nIGN said \"It has been said that episodes without Cartman are often the worst, and that's certainly the case here,\" giving the episode a 5.5/10.\n\n"}

Two versions of the legend exist, one involving a burnt insane asylum and the other an eccentric doctor. Both agree that there are seven gates in a wooded area of Hellam Township, Pennsylvania, and that anyone who passes through all seven goes straight to Hell. The location in question never housed an institution; the aforementioned doctor only constructed one gate, to keep out trespassers. Note: this is private land subjecting visitors to trespassing charges.\n\nThere are two popular versions of the myth, with numerous variants of each. One states that a mental institution used to be located on either Toad Road or Trout Run Road, depending on the source, in Hellam Township, Pennsylvania. It was erected in a remote location so as to isolate people deemed insane from the rest of the world. One day in the 1900s, a fire broke out and, due to its remoteness, firefighters could not reach the hospital in time to save it. Many patients died in the flames, while others escaped and were soon beaten to death.\n\nThe gates' role in the story is disputed. Some say that the gates were put up by the local search party to trap the remaining inmates. Others say that, completely unrelated to the asylum story, an eccentric physician who lived on the property built several gates along a path deep into the forest. Both accounts agree on only one gate being visible during the day, but the other six can be seen at night. According to the legend, no one has ever passed the fifth gate, but if they passed all seven, they would go directly to Hell.\n\nIn reality, there is no road called \"Toad Road\" in Hellam Township, but there is one named Trout Run Road. There was no asylum on Trout Run Road, and the local doctor only put up one gate to keep out trespassers. A related myth states that Hellam was named after Hell; this is untrue as well as it is a corruption of Hallam, after Hallamshire, England. The area purported to be the location of the seven gates is on private property and trespassers can be prosecuted.\n\nThe Seven Gates of Hell have received a fair amount of attention. Mike Argento wrote about it in the \"York Daily Record\", and Matt Lake featured a section on the gates in his book, \"Weird Pennsylvania\". Hellam Township published a page debunking the myths. Local resident Cheryl Englar reported a number of tourists searching for the gates, some harassing her and giving her cause to call the police. \n\n\"Toad Road\", a 2012 independent psychological horror film, makes use of the legend.\n\n"}

{"id": "215891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215891", "title": "Starvation", "text": "Starvation\n\nStarvation is a severe deficiency in caloric energy intake, below the level needed to maintain an organism's life. It is the most extreme form of malnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation can cause permanent organ damage and eventually, death. The term inanition refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation. Starvation may also be used as a means of torture or execution.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, hunger is the single gravest threat to the world's public health. The WHO also states that malnutrition is by far the biggest contributor to child mortality, present in half of all cases. Undernutrition is a contributory factor in the death of 3.1 million children under five every year. Figures on actual starvation are difficult to come by, but according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the less severe condition of undernourishment currently affects about 842 million people, or about one in eight (12.5%) people in the world population.\n\nThe bloated stomach represents a form of malnutrition called kwashiorkor which is caused by insufficient protein despite a sufficient caloric intake. Better medicine will prevent the pictured symptoms in which included is weight loss and muscle wasting from further taking form.\n\nCauses of hunger are related to poverty. There are inter-related issues causing hunger, which are related to economics and other factors that cause poverty. They include land rights and ownership, diversion of land use to non productive use, increasing emphasis on export oriented agriculture, inefficient agricultural practices, war, famine, drought, over fishing, poor crop yield, etc.\n\nThe basic cause of starvation is an imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In other words, the body expends more energy than it takes in. This imbalance can arise from one or more medical conditions or circumstantial situations, which can include:\n\nMedical reasons\n\nCircumstantial causes\nThe main causes of starvation are as follows:\n\nEarly symptoms include impulsivity, irritability, and hyperactivity. Atrophy (wasting away) of the stomach weakens the perception of hunger, since the perception is controlled by the percentage of the stomach that is empty. Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial fat (adipose tissue) and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy. \"Catabolysis\" is the process of a body breaking down its own muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems such as the nervous system and heart muscle (myocardium) functioning. The energy deficiency inherent in starvation causes fatigue and renders the victim more apathetic over time. As the starving person becomes too weak to move or even eat, their interaction with the surrounding world diminishes. In females, menstruation ceases when the body fat percentage is too low to support a fetus.\n\nVictims of starvation are often too weak to sense thirst, and therefore become dehydrated. All movements become painful due to muscle atrophy and dry, cracked skin that is caused by severe dehydration. With a weakened body, diseases are commonplace. Fungi, for example, often grow under the esophagus, making swallowing painful. Vitamin deficiency is also a common result of starvation, often leading to anemia, beriberi, pellagra, and scurvy. These diseases collectively can also cause diarrhea, skin rashes, edema, and heart failure. Individuals are often irritable and lethargic as a result.\n\nThere is insufficient scientific data on exactly how long people can live without food. Although the length of time varies with an individual's percentage of body fat and general health, one medical study estimates that in adults complete starvation leads to death within 8 to 12 weeks. There are isolated cases of individuals living up to 25 weeks without food. Starvation begins when an individual has lost about 30% of their normal body weight. Once the loss reaches 40% death is almost inevitable.\n\nUnder normal metabolic conditions, the human body relies on free blood glucose as its primary energy source. The level of blood sugar is tightly regulated; as blood glucose is consumed, the pancreas releases glucagon, a hormone that stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose. The glycogen stores are ordinarily replenished after every meal, but if the store is depleted before it can be replenished, the body enters hypoglycemia, and begins the starvation response.\n\nAfter the exhaustion of the glycogen reserve, and for the next 2–3 days, fatty acids become the principal metabolic fuel. At first, the brain continues to use glucose, because, if a non-brain tissue is using fatty acids as its metabolic fuel, the use of glucose in the same tissue is switched off. Thus, when fatty acids are being broken down for energy, all of the remaining glucose is made available for use by the brain. Basically the body will use up stored fat cells first, then move on to muscles.\n\nAfter 2 or 3 days of fasting, the liver begins to synthesize ketone bodies from precursors obtained from fatty acid breakdown. The brain uses these ketone bodies as fuel, thus cutting its requirement for glucose. After fasting for 3 days, the brain gets 30% of its energy from ketone bodies. After 4 days, this goes up to 75%. Thus, the production of ketone bodies cuts the brain's glucose requirement from 80 g per day to about 30 g per day. Of the remaining 30 g requirement, 20 g per day can be produced by the liver from glycerol (itself a product of fat breakdown). But this still leaves a deficit of about 10 g of glucose per day that must be supplied from some other source. This other source will be the body's own proteins.\n\nAfter several days of fasting, all cells in the body begin to break down protein. This releases alanine and lactate produced from pyruvate into the bloodstream, which can be converted into glucose by the liver. Since much of human muscle mass is protein, this phenomenon is responsible for the wasting away of muscle mass seen in starvation. However, the body is able to selectively decide which cells will break down protein and which will not. About 2–3 g of protein has to be broken down to synthesize 1 g of glucose; about 20–30 g of protein is broken down each day to make 10 g of glucose to keep the brain alive. However, this number may decrease the longer the fasting period is continued in order to conserve protein.\n\nStarvation ensues when the fat reserves are completely exhausted and protein is the only fuel source available to the body. Thus, after periods of starvation, the loss of body protein affects the function of important organs, and death results, even if there are still fat reserves left unused. (In a leaner person, the fat reserves are depleted earlier, the protein depletion occurs sooner, and therefore death occurs sooner.) The ultimate cause of death is, in general, cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac arrest brought on by tissue degradation and electrolyte imbalances.\n\nFor the individual, prevention consists of ensuring they eat plenty of food, varied enough to provide a nutritionally complete diet.\n\nStarvation can be caused by factors, other than illness, outside of the control of the individual. The Rome Declaration on World Food Security outlines several policies aimed at increasing food security and, consequently, preventing starvation. These include:\n\nSupporting farmers in areas of food insecurity through such measures as free or subsidized fertilizers and seeds increases food harvest and reduces food prices.\n\nStarving patients can be treated, but this must be done cautiously to avoid refeeding syndrome. Rest and warmth must be provided and maintained. Small sips of water mixed with glucose should be given in regular intervals. Fruit juices can also be given. Later, food can be given gradually in small quantities. The quantity of food can be increased over time. Proteins may be administered intravenously to raise the level of serum proteins.\n\nMany organizations have been highly effective at reducing starvation in different regions. Aid agencies give direct assistance to individuals, while political organizations pressure political leaders to enact more macro-scale policies that will reduce famine and provide aid.\n\nAccording to estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization there were 925 million under- or malnourished people in the world in 2010. This was a decrease from an estimate of roughly 1 billion malnourished people in 2009. In 2007, 923 million people were reported as being undernourished, an increase of 80 million since 1990-92. It has also been recorded that the world already produces enough food to support the world's population.\n\nAs the definitions of starving and malnourished people are different, the number of starving people is different from that of malnourished. Generally, far fewer people are starving, than are malnourished.\n\nThe proportion of malnourished and of starving people in the world has been more or less continually decreasing for at least several centuries. This is due to an increasing supply of food and to overall gains in economic efficiency. In 40 years, the proportion of malnourished people in the developing world has been more than halved. The proportion of starving people has decreased even faster.\n\nHistorically, starvation has been used as a death sentence. From the beginning of civilization to the Middle Ages, people were immured, or walled in, and would die for want of food.\n\nIn ancient Greco-Roman societies, starvation was sometimes used to dispose of guilty upper class citizens, especially erring female members of patrician families. For instance, in the year 31, Livilla, the niece and daughter-in-law of Tiberius, was discreetly starved to death by her mother for her adulterous relationship with Sejanus and for her complicity in the murder of her own husband, Drusus the Younger.\n\nAnother daughter-in-law of Tiberius, named Agrippina the Elder (a granddaughter of Augustus and the mother of Caligula), also died of starvation, in 33 AD. (However, it is not clear whether her starvation was self-inflicted.)\n\nA son and daughter of Agrippina were also executed by starvation for political reasons; Drusus Caesar, her second son, was put in prison in 33 AD, and starved to death by orders of Tiberius (he managed to stay alive for nine days by chewing the stuffing of his bed); Agrippina's youngest daughter, Julia Livilla, was exiled on an island in 41 by her uncle, Emperor Claudius, and subsequently her death by starvation was arranged by the empress Messalina.\nIt is also possible that Vestal Virgins were starved when found guilty of breaking their vows of celibacy.\n\nUgolino della Gherardesca, his sons and other members of his family were immured in the Muda, a tower of Pisa, and starved to death in the thirteenth century. Dante, his contemporary, wrote about Gherardesca in his masterpiece \"The Divine Comedy\".\n\nIn Sweden in 1317, King Birger of Sweden imprisoned his two brothers for a coup they had staged several years earlier (Nyköping Banquet). According to legend they died of starvation a few weeks later, since their brother had thrown the prison key in the castle moat.\n\nIn Cornwall in the UK in 1671, John Trehenban from St Columb Major was condemned to be starved to death in a cage at Castle An Dinas for the murder of two girls.\nThe Makah, a Native American tribe inhabiting the Pacific Northwest near the modern border of Canada and the United States, practiced death by starvation as a punishment for slaves.\n\nMany of the prisoners died in the Nazi concentration camps through deliberate maltreatment, disease, starvation, and overwork, or were executed as unfit for labor. Many occupants of ghettos in eastern Europe also starved to death, most notoriously in the Warsaw ghetto. Prisoners were transported in inhumane conditions by rail freight cars, in which many died before reaching their destination. The prisoners were confined to the cattle cars for days or even weeks, with little or no food or water. Many died of dehydration in the intense heat of summer or froze to death in winter. Nazi concentration camps in Europe from 1933 to 1945 deliberately underfed prisoners, who were at the same time forced to perform heavy labour. The diet was restricted to watery vegetable soup and a little bread, with little or no dietary fats, proteins or other essential nutrients. Such treatment led to loss of body tissues, and prisoners became skeletal, the so-called Muselmann who were murdered by gas or bullet when examined by camp doctors.\n\nStarvation was also used as a punishment where victims were locked into a small cell until dead, a process which could take many days.\nSaint Maximilian Kolbe, a martyred Polish friar, underwent a sentence of starvation in Auschwitz concentration camp in 1941. Ten prisoners had been condemned to death by starvation in the wake of a successful escape from the camp. Kolbe volunteered to take the place of a man with a wife and children. After two weeks of starvation, Kolbe and three other inmates remained alive; they were then executed with injections of phenol.\n\n"}

It was established on 3 June 1988, and was led by Vytautas Landsbergis. Its goal was to seek the return of independent status for Lithuania. \n\nIn the mid-1980s, Lithuania's Communist Party leadership hesitated to embrace Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost. The death of Petras Griškevičius, first secretary of the Communist Party of Lithuania, in 1987 was merely followed by the appointment of another rigid communist, Ringaudas Songaila. However, encouraged by the rhetoric of Mikhail Gorbachev, noting the strengthening position of Solidarity in Poland and encouraged by the Pope and the U.S. Government, Baltic independence activists began to hold public demonstrations in Riga, Tallinn, and Vilnius.\n\nAt a meeting at the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences on 3 June 1988, communist and non-communist intellectuals formed Sąjūdis Initiative Group (Lithuanian: \"Sąjūdžio iniciatyvinė grupė\") to organise a movement to support Gorbachev's program of glasnost, democratisation, and perestroika. The group composed of 35 members, mostly artists. 17 of the group members were also communist party members. Its goal was to organise the Sąjūdis Reform Movement, which became known subsequently simply as Sąjūdis.\n\nOn 24 June 1988, the first massive gathering organised by Sąjūdis took place. There delegates to the 19th All-Union Conference of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union were instructed about Sąjūdis goals. About 100,000 people in Vingis Park greeted the delegates when they came back in July. Another massive event took place on 23 August 1988, when about 250,000 people gathered to protest against the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and its secret protocol.\n\nOn 19 June 1988 the first issue of samizdat newspaper \"Sąjūdis News\" (Lithuanian: \"Sąjūdžio žinios\") was published. In September Sąjūdis published a legal newspaper, \"Atgimimas\" (English: \"rebirth\"). In total about 150 different newspapers were printed supporting Sąjūdis.\n\nIn October 1988 Sąjūdis held its founding conference in Vilnius. It elected 35-member council. Most its members were members of the initiative group. Vytautas Landsbergis, a professor of musicology who was not a member of the communist party, became the council's chairman.\n\nThe movement supported Gorbachev's policies, but at the same time promoted Lithuanian national issues such as restoration of the Lithuanian language as the official language. Its demands included the revelation of truth about the Stalinist years, protection of the environment, the halt to construction on a third nuclear reactor at the Ignalina nuclear power plant, and disclosure of the secret protocols of the Nazi-Soviet Non-aggression Pact, signed in 1939.\n\nSąjūdis used mass meetings to advance its goals. At first, Communist Party leaders shunned these meetings, but by mid-1988 their participation became a political necessity. A Sąjūdis rally on 24 June 1988, was attended by Algirdas Brazauskas, then party secretary for industrial affairs. In October 1988, Brazauskas was appointed first secretary of the communist party to replace Songaila. Communist leaders threatened to crack down on Sąjūdis, but backed down in the face of mass protests. Sąjūdis candidates fared well in elections to the Congress of People's Deputies, the newly created Soviet legislative body. Their candidates won in 36 of the 40 districts in which they ran.\n\nIn February 1989 Sąjūdis declared that Lithuania had been forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union and that the group's ultimate goal was to achieve independence. Lithuanian sovereignty was proclaimed in May 1989, and Lithuania's incorporation into the Soviet Union was declared illegal.\n\nOn 23 August 1989, the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Nazi-Soviet Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, a 600-kilometre, two-million-strong human chain reaching from Tallinn to Vilnius focused international attention on the aspirations of the Baltic nations. This demonstration and the coordinated efforts of the three nations became known as The Baltic Way.\n\nIn December the Communist Party of Lithuania seceded from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and agreed to give up its monopoly on power. In February 1990 Sąjūdis representatives won an absolute majority (101 seats out of 141) in the Supreme Council of the Lithuanian SSR. Vytautas Landsbergis was elected chairman of the Supreme Council. This led to the declaration of independence on 11 March 1990.\n\nToday, Sąjūdis is still active in Lithuania, but it has lost almost all its influence. The popularity of Sąjūdis lessened as it failed to maintain unity among people with different political beliefs and was ineffective coping with the economic crisis. The Democratic Labour Party (DLP; the former Communist Party of Lithuania) was victorious in the Seimas elections of November 1992.\n\nMuch of the group, including Landsbergis, formed the core of the Homeland Union, now the largest centre-right party in Lithuania.\n\n\n\n"}

The group targeted at least 28 casinos across the United States and one in Canada. The casinos lost around $7,000,000 to the organization. , 47 people were indicted, of which 42 had already pleaded guilty in relation to the conspiracy.\n\nThe criminal enterprise started around August 2002 in San Diego, California, and included Van Thu Tran, her husband Phuong Quoc \"Pai Gao John\" Truong, and Tai Khiem Tran. Many other members of the Tran family were also involved in the organization.\n\nThe organizers had themselves been card dealers. The organizers bribed card dealers and casino supervisors to do false shuffles to create \"slugs\" of cards with already-seen sequences. The system worked especially well with mini-baccarat, in which players are allowed to track cards openly. They later expanded to blackjack, in which the betting limits are higher but card counting is forbidden at most casinos; the group hid wireless microphones and earpieces on themselves to communicate with conspirators using computer programs to predict which cards would re-appear.\n\nCasinos often didn't realize they were being cheated until after the gang had already left town. Some casinos, suspecting they were being cheated in an unknown way, called on government authorities. \n\nThe FBI opened a case file in 2004. After Phuong Truong started shortchanging the colluding dealers out of their portion of the illegal money, some dealers became informants for the FBI. In June 2006, Mississippi Gaming Commission agents posed as corrupt dealers and secretly videotaped a meeting with Truong, in which he bragged openly about the scheme and its success.\n\nThe conspirators were rounded up in 2007. By 2007, Truong and 46 confederates were indicted for racketeering, theft and money laundering. Truong pleaded guilty and received 70 months in prison.\n\nTai Khiem Tran pleaded guilty to guilty to conspiracy and racketeering in 2009, but Van Thu Tran pleaded not guilty to those charges. Van Thu Tran instead pleaded guilty in January 2011, and was ordered to pay $5.7 million in restitution payable to several casinos. On September 28, 2012, Van Thu Tran was sentenced in San Diego to 36 months in prison for her role in the scheme, with three years of supervised release. At that point, 42 defendants had pleaded guilty to charges relating to the cheating conspiracy, admitting overall to targeting a combined total of 29 US and Canada casinos.\n\n"}
{"id": "5672698", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5672698", "title": "Types of rape", "text": "Types of rape\n\nRape can be categorized in different ways: for example, by reference to the situation in which it occurs, by the identity or characteristics of the victim, and by the identity or characteristics of the perpetrator. These categories are referred to as types of rape. The types of rape described below are not mutually exclusive: a given rape can fit into multiple categories, by for example by being both a prison rape and a gang rape, or both a custodial rape and the rape of a child.\n\nThe term \"date rape\" is used to refer to several types of rape, broadly acquaintance rape, which is a non-domestic rape committed by someone who knows the victim, and drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), where the rapist intentionally drugs the victim with a date rape drug so that they are incapacitated. Acquaintance rape constitutes the vast majority of reported rapes, while DFSA is infrequent. A frequently overlapping category is \"incapacitated rape,\" where the victim is incapacitated and unable to give consent – this is often the result of intoxication, but can also simply be because the victim is asleep or has a medical condition. DFSA is when the rapist intentionally incapacitates the victim via drugs, while acquaintance rape can occur when the victim is not incapacitated.\n\nAcquaintance rape can occur between two people who know one another usually in social situations, between people who are dating as a couple and have had consensual sex in the past, between two people who are starting to date, between people who are just friends, and between acquaintances. They include rapes of co-workers, schoolmates, family, friends, teachers and other acquaintances, providing they are dating; it is sometimes referred to as \"hidden rape\" and has been identified as a growing problem in western society. A college survey conducted by the United States' National Victim Center reported that one in four college women have been raped or experienced attempted rape. This report indicates that young women are at considerable risk of becoming a victim of date rape while in college. In addition, there have been reported incidents of colleges questioning accounts of alleged victims, further complicating documentation and policing of student assaults, despite such preventative legislation as the Clery Act.\n\nGang rape occurs when a group of people participate in the rape of a single victim. Rape involving at least two or more violators (usually at least three) is widely reported to occur in many parts of the world. Systematic information on the extent of the problem, however, is scant.\n\nOne study showed that offenders and victims in gang rape incidents were younger with a higher possibility of being unemployed. Gang rapes involved more alcohol and other drug use, night attacks and severe sexual assault outcomes and less victim resistance and fewer weapons than individual rapes. Another study found that group sexual assaults were more violent and had greater resistance from the victim than individual sexual assaults and that victims of group sexual assaults were more likely to seek crisis and police services, contemplate suicide, and seek therapy than those involved in individual assaults. The two groups were about the same in the amount of drinking and other drug use during the assault.\n\nAlso known as marital rape, wife rape, husband rape, partner rape or intimate partner sexual assault (IPSA), is rape between a married or \"de facto\" couple. Research reveals that victims of marital/partner rape suffer longer lasting trauma than victims of stranger rape.\n\nRape of a child is a form of child sexual abuse. When committed by another child (usually older or stronger) or adolescent, it is called child-on-child sexual abuse. When committed by a parent or other close relatives such as grandparents, aunts and uncles, it is also incest and can result in serious and long-term psychological trauma. When a child is raped by an adult who is not a family member but is a caregiver or in a position of authority over the child, such as school teachers, religious authorities, sports trainers (coaches) or therapists, to name a few, on whom the child is dependent, the effects can be similar to incestual rape.\n\nNational and regional governments, citing an interest in protecting \"young people\" (variously defined but sometimes synonymous with minors) from sexual exploitation, treat any sexual contact with such a person as an offense (not always categorized as \"rape\"), even if he or she agrees to or initiates the sexual activity.\n\nThe offense is often based on a presumption that people under a certain age do not have the capacity to give consent. The age at which individuals are considered competent to give consent, called the age of consent, varies in different countries and regions; in the US, the age ranges from 16 to 18. Sexual activity that violates age-of-consent law, but is neither violent nor physically coerced, is sometimes described as \"statutory rape\", a legally-recognized category in the United States. Most states, however, allow persons younger than the age of consent to engage in sexual activity if the age difference between the partners is small; these are called close-in-age exemptions or a Romeo and Juliet exemption and even in countries where there is no official legal exemption prosecutions are infrequent.\n\nRates of prison rape have been reported as affecting between 3% and 12% of prison inmates in the US. Although prison rapes are more commonly same-sex crimes (since prisons are usually separated by sex), the attacker usually does not identify as homosexual. This phenomenon is much less common elsewhere in the western world. This is partly because of the differences in the structure of the prison system in the US as compared to the prison systems in Canada, Australia and Europe.\n\nThe attacker is most commonly another inmate.\n\nSerial rape is rape committed by a person over a relatively long period of time and committed on a number of victims. Most times this type of rapist is unknown to the victim and follows a specific and predictable pattern of targeting and assaulting victims.\n\n\"Payback rape\", also called \"punishment rape\" or \"revenge rape\", is a form of rape specific to certain cultures, particularly the Pacific Islands. It consists of the rape of a female, usually by a group of several males, as revenge for acts committed by members of her family, such as her father or brothers. The rape is meant to humiliate the father or brothers, as punishment for their prior behavior towards the perpetrators. Payback rape is sometimes connected to tribal fighting.\n\nWar rapes are rapes committed by soldiers, other combatants or civilians during armed conflict or war, or during military occupation. It also covers the situation where girls and women are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery by an occupying power.\n\nDuring war, rape is often used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy and undermine their morale. Rapes in war are often systematic and thorough, and military leaders may actually encourage their soldiers to rape civilians. Likewise, systematic rapes are often employed as a form of ethnic cleansing.\n\nWar rape has been considered a war crime only since 1949. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention explicitly prohibits wartime rape and enforced prostitution. These prohibitions were reinforced by the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions. Therefore, during the post-war Nuremberg Trials and Tokyo Trials, mass war rape was not prosecuted as a war crime.\n\nIn 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda established by the United Nations made landmark decisions that rape is a crime of genocide under international law. In one judgement, Navanethem Pillay said: \"From time immemorial, rape has been regarded as spoils of war. Now it will be considered a war crime. We want to send out a strong message that rape is no longer a trophy of war.\"\n\nThe word \"rape\" only began to be used to refer to sexual assault in the early 15th century, and its dominant usage remained to refer to abduction and robbery without any connotation of sexual assault until the modern period. Many classical references to rape during war do not refer explicitly to instances of sexual assault, but rather to the practice of abducting the women or property of the enemy during warfare.\n\nRape by deception occurs when the perpetrator gains the victim's agreement through fraud. In one case, a man pretended to be an official for a government who had power to cause negative impacts on a woman to pressure a woman into sexual activities. The courts held that he had falsely represented himself and thus used deception against the woman.\n\nCorrective rape is targeted rape against non-heterosexuals as a punishment for violating gender roles. It is a form of hate crime against LGBT individuals, mainly lesbians, in which the rapist justifies the act as an acceptable response to the victim's perceived sexual or gender orientation and a form of punishment for being gay. Often, the stated argument of the corrective rapist is that the rape will turn the person straight, \"correcting\" their sex or gender, i.e. make them conform to societal norms. The term was first coined in South Africa after well-known cases of corrective rape, such as that of sports star Eudy Simelane, became public.\n\nCustodial rape is rape perpetrated by a person employed by the state in a supervisory or custodial position, such as a police officer, public servant or jail or hospital employee. It includes the rape of children in institutional care such as orphanages.\n\nCustodial rape has been reported in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Iran, Cambodia, Nigeria, Kenya, Zambia and the United States.\n\nIn India custodial rape has been a major focus of women's rights organizations, and has been an official category of rape defined under law since 1983. Indian law says this type of rape takes advantage of the rapist's position of authority and is therefore subject to extra penalty.\n\nThe term custodial rape is sometimes used broadly to include rape by anyone in a position of authority such as an employer, money-lender, contractor or landlord, but under Indian law it refers only to government employees. Victims of custodial rape are frequently minorities, people who are poor, or low-status for example because of their caste. Researchers say custodial rape is part of a broader pattern of custodial abuse, which can also include torture and murder.\n\nNicholas Groth has described three types of rape, based on the goal of the rapist. This includes the anger rapist, power rapist and sadistic rapist. According to Howard Barbaree, a psychologist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, most rapes are impulsive and opportunistic, and committed by people who may commit other impulsive acts, including impulsive crimes. These rapists tend to show no anger except in response to their victim's resistance, and use little unnecessary force.\n\nAs mentioned above, when differing acts of rape are defined and typified, whether by popular convention, research of the subject, or otherwise, the results are often neither exclusive nor exhaustive in scope. Some instances may fit two or more definitions, while others may remain as yet undefined. One example of this are the following sub-classifications created by American researcher Patricia Rozee:\n\n\nWhere they are not already typed above, many of these otherwise distinct forms could equally apply to other classifications (e.g. prison rape that is also punitive rape, war rape that is also theft rape, etc.)\n\n"}

Normally, the spoof website will adopt the design of the target website and sometimes has a similar URL. A more sophisticated attack results in an attacker creating a \"shadow copy\" of the World Wide Web by having all of the victim's traffic go through the attacker's machine, causing the attacker to obtain the victim's sensitive information.\n\nAnother technique is to use a 'cloaked' URL. By using domain forwarding, or inserting control characters, the URL can appear to be genuine while concealing the address of the actual website.\n\nThe objective may be fraudulent, often associated with phishing or e-mail spoofing, or to criticize or make fun of the person or body whose website the spoofed site purports to represent. Because the purpose is often malicious, \"spoof\" (an expression whose base meaning is innocent parody) is a poor term for this activity so that more accountable organisations such as government departments and banks tend to avoid it, preferring more explicit descriptors such as \"fraudulent\" or \"phishing\".\n\nAs an example of the use of this technique to parody an organisation, in November 2006 two spoof websites, www.msfirefox.com and www.msfirefox.net, were produced claiming that Microsoft had bought Firefox and released \"Microsoft Firefox 2007.\"\n\nSpoofed websites predominate in efforts developing anti-phishing software though there are concerns about their effectiveness. A majority of efforts are focused on the PC market leaving mobile devices lacking You can see from the table below that few user studies have been run against the current tools in the market. \n\nDNS is the layer at which botnets control drones. In 2006, OpenDNS began offering a free service to prevent users from entering website spoofing sites. Essentially, OpenDNS has gathered a large database from various anti-phishing and anti-botnet organizations as well as its own data to compile a list of known website spoofing offenders. When a user attempts to access one of these bad websites, they are blocked at the DNS level. APWG statistics show that most phishing attacks use URLs, not domain names, so there would be a large amount of website spoofing that OpenDNS would be unable to track. At the time of release, OpenDNS is unable to prevent unnamed phishing exploits that sit on Yahoo, Google etc.\n\n"}
{"id": "1384458", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1384458", "title": "World Conference (Community of Christ)", "text": "World Conference (Community of Christ)\n\nWorld Conference is the highest legislative body in the Community of Christ and is empowered to act for the entire church. It operates according to a principle known as \"common consent\" and is presided over by the First Presidency. The functioning of the councils, quorums and orders of the swage are also considered an important part of the World Conference.\n\nDelegates to the conference are elected by Mission Center conferences. Motions are often debated vigorously and the results are sometimes close and controversial. World Conferences are traditionally held at Community of swage World Headquarters, with the legislative and main worship services held in the Auditorium.\n\nWorld Conferences were originally known as \"General Conferences.\" The first General Conference of the church, then known as the Church of Christ, was held on June 9, 1830—only two months after its organization. Convened in Fayette, New York, it was presided over by Joseph Smith. The conference included a gathering of the 27 members of the church. \n\nOriginally held semiannually, or as need arose, the church switched to an annual meeting in the late-nineteenth century. With many members desiring to meet more than once a year, summer gatherings were held, starting in 1883, as reunions (a tradition that continues to this day). In the twentieth century, the church decided to meet biannually. Then, at the 2007 World Conference, it was decided that World Conferences would be held tri-annually. Switching to a conference every three years, instead of every two, was anticipated to be less taxing on church resources, and to provide for greater participation by members who reside abroad. \n\nThe most recent World Conference was held June 5–11, 2016.\n\nThe World Conference Opening Ceremonies traditionally include a ceremony featuring the flags of the nations where the church is organized and often include a welcome address by a featured speaker from another denomination, as well as welcomes by local elected officials. The councils, quorums and orders of the church hold separate meetings during World Conference as do several delegate caucuses. The usual agenda calls for these meetings during weekday mornings, with most of the general legislative sessions of the World Conference in the afternoon. Evening worship services often include a contemporary worship service, an outreach service, and a service in which the President of the Community of Christ addresses the church in an important address that sets the agenda and tone, not only for the conference, but for the work of the church in the coming years. A group of communion services are usually held on the Sunday morning of the conference, including a very large and well-coordinated service held in the Auditorium, which is regarded by many as one of the highlights of the World Conference. Worship services feature the Auditorium Organ and the Temple Organ. Organ recitals are typically held during the lunch break following the Daily Prayer for Peace. On occasion, the Community of Christ International Peace Award has been presented during a World Conference.\n\nThe Conference Organization and Procedures Committee normally submits the rules and procedures to be followed at a particular conference. The conference manager attends to the logistics of the conference while the World Church Secretary serves as the legislative clerk. Voting is by a show of hands, however on close votes when the chair is in doubt, votes are counted by delegation and apportioned based on the relative membership of each mission center/jurisdiction. This rather complex voting procedure is designed to protect the voting rights of international delegations that may not have been able to recruit a full slate of delegates to represent them in the conference. \n\nDelegates attend from a majority of the fifty nations where the church is organized. The largest numbers of delegates are from the United States, Canada and French Polynesia. Translators for more than a dozen languages sit overhead the main conference floor and present real time translations of the conference to any of the delegates on the floor who prefer to participate in a language other than English. Numbered lecterns in the conference chamber are available to those who wish to speak. They gain the floor to make motions or speak by submitting a card to a computer attendant at the lectern who enters the request into a queue. In this fashion, the presiding officer is able to call upon speakers with alternating pro and con viewpoints, as well as give preference to priority motions. According to church bylaws Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised is the parliamentary authority for the conference except where they may be in conflict with the bylaws, adopted rules of order for the conference, and past resolutions. Great deference is normally shown by most delegates to the President of the church in regards to the management of the agenda and debate, however, controversial issues are sometimes brought to the conference, thoughtfully considered from many viewpoints, and may be decided by close or split votes.\n\nThe usual items of business that come before the conference are votes to sustain leadership, approve priesthood calls to major offices, elect the Board of Trustees of Graceland University, elect the World Church Finance Board, set the budget for the church, approve legislative resolutions and set the dates for the next conference. When an inspired document is presented to the church by the prophet-president, its consideration and the decision of whether or not to include it in the Doctrine and Covenants becomes the primary matter of reflection for the body.\n\n\n"}

Richards beat Day 3–1, becoming world champion for an unprecedented fourth time. \n\nThe main event was preceded by a Junior World Scrabble Championship that was won by Pakistani Moiz Ullah Baig. The World Scrabble Championship 2018 took place at the Riveria International Centre in Torquay, Devon, England from 23 to 27 October, with the finals being held at a \"clearview cube\" in the Westfield Shopping Centre in London a day later, as part of Scrabble's 70th anniversary celebrations. The prize fund for the tournament was £15,500. There were also concurrent events played in five different languages including Catalan, Spanish, French, Norwegian, and German.\n\nAfter 35 preliminary rounds, the top eight, which included three-time world champion Nigel Richards (2007, 2011, 2013), world champions Brett Smitheram (2016) and Wellington Jighere (2015), and 2014 runner-up Chris Lipe, advanced to the quarter-finals. The defending champion David Eldar was absent, whereas former world champions Craig Beevers (2014), Joel Wapnick (1999), and Mark Nyman (1993) were knocked out of contention.\n\nMalaysia-based Nigel Richards, who was born in New Zealand, defeated American data-scientist Jesse Day in the best-of-five finals; Richards had previously won the world championship in 2007, 2011, and 2013, as well as the French world championship in 2013 and 2018. Notable plays by Richards included GROUTIER for 64 points, ZONULAR (100) and PHENOLIC (84), while Day managed a 95-pointer MALEDICT. Richards, who was awarded £6,200, described the championship as \"closely-fought\", while praising Day for being an \"impressive opponent\".\n"}
