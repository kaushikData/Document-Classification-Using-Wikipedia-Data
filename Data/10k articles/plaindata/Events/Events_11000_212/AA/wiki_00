This Worldcon never chose an official name other than the title \"10th World Science Fiction Convention,\" as both the convention's issued membership card and program book clearly stated. Only the first Worldcon in New York City (1939) and the 11th in Philadelphia, 1953, shared this lack of a formal convention name. The phrases \"Tenth Anniversary World Science Fiction Convention\" (TAWSFiC) and \"Tenth Anniversary Science Fiction Convention\" (TASFiC, likely a simple linotype error, as \"World\" is missing) were each used in some of this Worldcon's pre-convention materials; the phrase's acronyms \"TAWSFiC\" and \"TASFiC\" were never officially used in print or otherwise by the Chicago committee at that time. However, the 10th Worldcon \"was\" frequently referred to by its members by the unofficial name Chicon II, so dubbed after the previous Chicago Worldcon (Chicon) in 1940; this name proved so popular that the convention became known as Chicon II in science fiction fandom's lore and written histories.\n\nThe convention chair was Julian C. May (later also known as Judy Dikty). Hugo Gernsback was the convention's official guest of honor. The program included the performance of an original science fiction ballet.\n\nFor years this Worldcon held the record for the largest attendance at any early science fiction convention, with 870 registered attendees, a figure which was not surpassed by another Worldcon until 1967 for Nycon 3 in New York City. By way of comparison, the previous year's Worldcon, the Nolacon in New Orleans, had an attendance of 190.\n\nIt was at this Worldcon that the idea for the Hugo science fiction awards was first proposed and adopted. These awards, the highest and oldest honor in science fiction, were first awarded at the 1953 Worldcon in Philadelphia.\n\nThe convention is said to have been the place where Sturgeon's Law was first formulated (although other origin stories claim Sturgeon first articulated the concept in 1951, a year earlier). During a panel discussion on science fiction, one of the panelists observed that about 90% of science fiction was crud. Theodore Sturgeon, also on the panel, replied that 90% of \"everything\" was crud.\n\n\n\n"}

The pirates shot at random targets, killing at least 21 people and injuring 11 others, and snatched some $200,000 from a local bank as well as another $5,000 from the Malaysia Airlines office.\n\nMost areas in the east coast of Sabah are known for many Filipino communities, both legal and illegal. These areas have become the haven for pirates from the Philippines and Sabah itself has suffered 10 major attacks since 1976. On 23 September evening, suddenly a number of armed men clad in jungle green uniforms appeared in the town and started to shoot random targets. The shoot-out left the town with destruction and blood could be found anywhere. One of the victims, a pregnant woman, was shot when she was being driven home in a van. The van driver brought her to the hospital but she was pronounced dead on arrival. Another victim, a Chinese, was injured by a gunshot during the raid. During an interviewed with him, he told..\nThe instability of the Philippines has caused major economic problems for Sabah. Philippine army raids against anti-Marcos factions in the Sulu and Mindanao island have left many houses and fields destroyed, forcing an estimated 100,000 Moro people in the Southern Philippines to flee to Sabah. While many who have not left the Philippine islands have involved in criminal activities, mainly on smuggling and armed robbery.\n\nAfter their successful attempt, the pirates later retreated to a jetty where they engaging a group of Malaysian Marine Police. Two of the pirates were wounded during a gun battle with the marine police which their friends still managed to carry their injured friends into two awaiting pump boats as the pirates made their getaway back to the Philippines. In the next day, the Marine Police launched a surprise attacks on an island which believe to be their hide-out and managed to kill five pirates. While the rest of the pirates have escaped to the international border, the police recovered a number of M16 rifles with a whole armoury of assorted weapons. Some ambiguous source alleged on the apparent retaliation, the Royal Malaysian Navy with four ships and three helicopters attacked a Filipino island, bombed the island's settlement, burning houses and killing 53 Filipino residents. The Malaysian Embassy in Manila declined to comment on the report and said the Malaysian embassy has not received any information from the Philippine government or from the Malaysia's capital of Kuala Lumpur.\n\n"}

It is nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\" and \"The Track Too Tough to Tame\" by many NASCAR fans and drivers and advertised as \"A NASCAR Tradition.\" It is of a unique, somewhat egg-shaped design, an oval with the ends of very different configurations, a condition which supposedly arose from the proximity of one end of the track to a minnow pond the owner refused to relocate.

{"id": "20459650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20459650", "title": "Ajmal Kasab", "text": "Ajmal Kasab\n\nMohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab () ‎; 13 July 1987 – 21 November 2012) was a Pakistani terrorist and a member of the Lashkar-e-Taiba Islamist group, through which he took part in the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks in Maharashtra state of India. Kasab was the only attacker captured alive by police.\n\nKasab was born in Faridkot, Pakistan to a family belonging to the Qassab community. He left his home in 2005, engaging in petty crime and armed robbery with a friend. In late 2007, he and his friend encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, distributing pamphlets, and were persuaded to join.\n\nOn 3 May 2010, Kasab was found guilty of 80 offences, including murder, waging war against India, possessing explosives, and other charges. On 6 May 2010, the same trial court sentenced him to death on four counts and to a life sentence on five counts. Kasab's death sentence was upheld by the Bombay High Court on 21 February 2011. The verdict was upheld by the Supreme Court of India on 29 August 2012. Kasab was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30 am. and buried at Yerwada Jail in Pune.\n\nKasab was born in Faridkot village in the Okara District of Punjab, Pakistan, to Amir Shahban Kasab and Noor Illahi. His father ran a snack cart while his elder brother, Afzal, worked as a labourer in Lahore. His elder sister, Rukaiyya Husain, was married and lived in the village. A younger sister, Suraiyya, and brother, Munir, lived in Faridkot with their parents. The family belongs to the Qassab community.\n\nKasab briefly joined his brother in Lahore and then returned to Faridkot. He left home after a fight with his father in 2005. He had asked for new clothes on Eid, but his father could not provide them, which made him angry. He engaged in petty crime with his friend Muzaffar Lal Khan, moving on to armed robbery. On 21 December 2007, Eid al-Adha, they were in Rawalpindi trying to buy weapons when they encountered members of Jama'at-ud-Da'wah, the political wing of Lashkar-e-Taiba, distributing pamphlets. They decided to sign up for training with the Lashkar-e-Taiba, ending up at their base camp, Markaz Taiba.\n\nAn interrogator and deputy commissioner of the Mumbai Police stated that Kasab spoke rough Hindi and almost no English. He said his father in effect sold him to Lashkar-e-Taiba so that he could use the money they gave him to support the family. His father denied it. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a senior commander of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, reportedly offered to pay his family Rs.150,000 for his participation in the attacks. Another report said the 23-year-old was recruited from his home, in part, based on a pledge by recruiters to pay Rs.100,000 to his family if he became a martyr. Other sources put the reward at US$4,000.\n\nVillagers of Okara claimed on camera that he was at their village six months before the Mumbai attack. They said that he asked his mother to bless him as he was going for Jihad, and claimed that he demonstrated his wrestling skills to a few village boys that day.\n\nAjmal Kasab was among a group of 24 men who received training in marine warfare at a remote camp in mountainous Muzaffarabad, Azad Kashmir in Pakistan. Part of the training was reported to have taken place on the Mangla Dam reservoir.\n\nKasab was seen on CCTV during his attacks at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus along with another recruit, Ismail Khan. Kasab reportedly told the police that they wanted to replicate the Islamabad Marriott hotel attack, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 9/11 attacks in India.\n\nKasab and his accomplice Khan, then aged 25, attacked the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (formerly Victoria Terminus) railway station. They then moved on to attack a police vehicle (a white Toyota Qualis) at Cama Hospital, in which senior Mumbai police officers (Maharashtra ATS Chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner of Mumbai Police Ashok Kamte) were travelling. After killing them in a gun battle and taking two constables hostage in the Qualis, Kasab and Khan drove towards the Metro cinema. Kasab joked about the bulletproof vests worn by the police and killed one constable when his mobile phone rang. The two fired some shots into a crowd gathered at the Metro Cinema. They then drove to Vidhan Bhavan where they fired more shots. Their vehicle had a tire puncture, so they stole a silver Škoda Laura and drove towards Girgaum Chowpatty beach.\n\nThe D B Marg police had received a message from police control at about , that two heavily armed men had gunned down commuters at CST. 15 policemen from D B Marg were sent to Chowpatty to set up a double barricade on Marine Drive. The Škoda reached Chowpatty and halted 40 to 50 feet from the barricade. It reversed and attempted a U-turn. A shootout ensued and Khan was killed. Kasab lay motionless playing dead. Assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Omble, armed only with a lathi, charged the vehicle, being shot five times. Omble held onto Kasab's weapon, enabling Omble's colleagues to capture Kasab alive. Omble died from the bullet wounds. A mob gathered and attacked the two terrorists, which was captured on video.\n\nInitially Kasab pretended to be dead and was being transported to the Nair Hospital when a police officer discovered Kasab was breathing. Seeing the mutilated body of another slain terrorist Kasab begged doctors to put him on saline, saying \"I do not want to die\". The doctors who treated Kasab said he had no bullet wounds.\n\nKasab told police he was trained to \"kill to the last breath\", Later, after interrogation in the hospital by the police, he said: \"Now, I do not want to live\", requesting the interrogators to kill him for the safety of his family in Pakistan, who could be killed or tortured for his surrender to Indian police. (Fidayeen suicide squad terrorists were instructed not to be captured and interrogated, use aliases instead of their real names, and hide their nationality. He is also quoted as saying \"I have done right, I have no regrets\". Reports also surfaced that the group planned to escape safely after the attack.)\n\nKasab told interrogators that all through the operation, the Lashkar headquarters from Karachi, Pakistan, remained in touch with the group, calling their phones through a voice-over-internet service. Investigators succeeded in reconstructing the group's journey through the Garmin GPS that was found on Kasab. The email sent from a group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen claiming responsibility was traced to a Russian proxy which was traced back to Lahore with the help of the FBI.\n\nPolice announced Kasab was a Pakistani national based on his confession and other evidence. Several reporters visited Kasab's village and verified the facts provided by him. Former Pakistan Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif confirmed that Kasab was from Faridkot village in Pakistan, and criticised President Zardari for cordoning off the village and not allowing his parents to meet anyone.\n\nJournalist Saeed Shah travelled to Kasab's village and produced national identity card numbers of his parents. His parents left town on the night of 3 December 2008. Mumbai Joint Police Commissioner of Crime Rakesh Maria said Kasab was from the Faridkot village in the Okara district of Pakistan's Punjab province, and was the son of Mohammed Amir Kasab.\n\nThe Mumbai Police said much of the information that Kasab provided proved to be accurate. He disclosed the location of a fishing trawler, MV \"Kuber\", that the terrorists used to enter Mumbai's coastal waters. He told investigators where his team put the ship captain's body, a satellite phone and a global-positioning device, which the police found.\n\nPakistani officials, including President Asif Ali Zardari, initially denied Ajmal Kasab was Pakistani. Pakistani government officials attempted to erase evidence that there was a Lashkar-e-Taiba office in Deepalpur. The office was hurriedly closed in the week of 7 December. On the night of 3 December 2008, the parents were whisked away by a \"bearded Mullah\", and since then, there was evidence of a cover-up by plainclothes police. Villagers changed their stories, and reporters who visit there were intimidated. In early December, Kasab's father admitted in an interview that Kasab was his son.\n\nIn January 2009, Pakistan's National Security Advisor Mahmud Ali Durrani admitted to Kasab being a Pakistani citizen while speaking to the CNN-IBN news channel. The Pakistan Government then acknowledged that Ajmal Kasab was a Pakistani, but also announced that Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani had fired Durrani for \"failing to take Gilani and other stakeholders into confidence\" before making this information public, and for \"a lack of coordination on matters of national security.\"\n\nOn 6 December 2008, \"The Hindu\" reported that the police officers who interrogated him did not speak his language, Urdu, and misinterpreted his caste origin \"kasai\", meaning butcher, to be a surname, writing it as \"Kasav\".\n\n\"The Times of India\" reported a different version of the error. The paper stated that the police officers correctly understood that Ajmal Kasab does not have a surname. To satisfy an administrative requirement that people have surnames, the officers asked Kasab for his father's profession, and decided to use \"butcher\", or \"Kasab\" in Urdu, as his surname.\n\n\"The Hindu\" referred to him as either \"Mohammad Ajmal Amir, son of Mohammad Amir Iman\" or \"Mohammad Ajmal Amir 'Kasab'\".\n\nList of various names used to refer to Kasab:\n\nAmmunition, a satellite phone and a layout plan of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus was recovered from Kasab. He described how his team arrived at Mumbai from Karachi via Porbandar. He said that they had received revolvers, AK-47s, ammunition and dried fruit from their coordinator. Kasab told the police that they wanted to replicate the Marriott hotel attack in Islamabad, and reduce the Taj Hotel to rubble, replicating the 11 September attacks in US. Kasab told police that his team targeted Nariman House, where the Chabad centre was located, because it was frequented by Israelis, who were targeted to \"avenge atrocities on Palestinians.\"\n\nKasab told the police that he and his associate, Ismail Khan, were the ones who shot Anti-Terror Squad chief Hemant Karkare, encounter specialist Vijay Salaskar and Additional Commissioner Ashok Kamte. Kasab entered the Taj posing as a student from Mauritius and stored explosives in one of the hotel's rooms. In December 2009, Kasab retracted his confession in court, claiming he had come to Mumbai to act in Bollywood films and was arrested by the Mumbai police three days before the attacks.\n\nKasab repeatedly asked the interrogators to turn the camera off and warned them he would not speak otherwise. Nonetheless the following confessions were recorded on video:\n\nWhen police asked Kasab what he understood about jihad, Kasab told the interrogators \"it Jihad is about killing and getting killed and becoming famous.\" \"Come, kill and die after a killing spree. By this one will become famous and will also make God proud.\"\n\nAccording to an officer, Kasab spoke Pathani Hindi, and told the police that he threw up the moment he saw all the blood and gore. \"Kasab said that he could not bear the sight of dead bodies and after creating enough havoc wanted to go back to Pakistan,\" the officer said.\n\n\"We were told that our big brother India is so rich and we are dying of poverty and hunger. My father sells dahi wada in a stall in Lahore and we did not even get enough food to eat from his earnings. I was promised that once they knew that I was successful in my operation, they would give 150,000 rupees (around US$3,352), to my family,\" said Kasab.\n\nPolice said they were shocked by his readiness to switch loyalties after he was apprehended. \"If you give me regular meals and money I will do the same for you that I did for them,\" he said.\n\n\"When we asked whether he knew any verses from the Quran that described jihad, Kasab said he did not,\" police said. \"In fact he did not know much about Islam or its tenets,\" according to a police source.\n\nOn 9 August 2012, Kasab was brought face-to-face with Abu Jundal, the handler of Mumbai attacks, at the Arthur Road jail where they identified each other. Kasab also admitted that Jundal had taught him Hindi.\n\nIn a press conference, the Mumbai city police commissioner said \"The person we have caught alive is certainly a Pakistani. They were all trained by ex-army officers, some for a year, some for more than a year\". On 23 November 2008 they set sail from Karachi unarmed to be picked up by a larger vessel. They hijacked the Indian fishing trawler \"Kuber\" and set sail for Mumbai.\n\n\"The Times\" reported on 3 December 2008 that Indian police were going to submit Kasab to a narco analysis test to definitively determine his nationality.\n\nAccording to \"DNA India\", Kasab began reading the autobiography of India's non-violent leader Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi in early March 2009, in response to coaxing by prison guards.\n\nSeveral Indian lawyers refused to represent Kasab citing ethical concerns. A resolution was passed unanimously by the Bombay Metropolitan Magistrate Court's Bar Association, which has more than 1,000 members, saying that none of its members would defend any of the accused of the terror attacks. Other bar associations passed similar resolutions. The Hindu nationalist group Shiv Sena threatened lawyers against representing him. When one attorney, Ashok Sarogi, hinted that he would be willing to represent Kasab, Shiv Shena members protested outside his home and pelted it with stones, forcing him to retract. In December 2008, the Indian Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan said that for a fair trial, Kasab needed a lawyer.\n\nAn eight-member commission from Pakistan, comprising defence lawyers, prosecutors and a court official was allowed to travel to India on 15 March to gather evidences for the prosecution of seven suspects linked to the 2008 Mumbai attacks. However, the defence lawyers were barred from cross-examining the four prosecution witnesses in the case including Ajmal Kasab.\n\nKasab wrote to the Pakistani High Commission in India requesting help and legal aid. In the letter, he confirmed he and the nine slain terrorists were Pakistani. He asked the Pakistani High Commission to take custody of the body of fellow terrorist Ismail Khan. Pakistani officials confirmed the receipt of the letter and were reported to be studying it. No further updates were given.\n\nOn 1 April 2009, Senior Advocate Anjali Waghmare agreed to represent Kasab, despite Shiv Sena activists having protested and stoned her home.\n\nHis conviction was based on CCTV footage showing him striding across the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus with an AK-47 and a backpack. Towards the end of December 2008, Ujjwal Nikam was appointed as Public Prosecutor for trying Kasab and in January 2009 M.L. Tahaliyani was appointed the judge for the case. Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page Chargesheet against Kasab on 25 February 2009. Due to the fact that the chargesheet was written in Marathi and English, Kasab requested an Urdu translation of the charge sheet. He was charged with murder, conspiracy and waging war against India along with other crimes. His trial was originally scheduled to start on 15 April 2009 but was postponed as his lawyer, Anjali Waghmare was dismissed for a conflict of interest. It resumed on 17 April 2009 after Abbas Kazmi was assigned as his new defence counsel. On 20 April 2009, the prosecution submitted a list of charges against him, including the murder of 166 people. On 6 May 2009, Kasab pleaded not guilty to 86 charges. The same month he was identified by eyewitnesses who testified witnessing his actual arrival and him firing at the victims. Later the doctors who treated him also identified him. On 2 June 2009, Kasab told the judge he also understood the Marathi language.\n\nIn June 2009, the special court issued non-bailable warrants against 22 absconding accused including Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD) chief Hafeez Saeed and chief of operations of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Zaki-ur-Rehman Laqvi. On 20 July 2009 Kasab retracted his non-guilty plea and pleaded guilty to all charges. On 18 December 2009, he retracted his guilty plea and claimed that he was framed and his confession was obtained by torture. Instead he claimed to have come to Mumbai 20 days before the attacks and was simply strolling at Juhu beach when police arrested him. The trial concluded on 31 March 2010 and on 3 May the verdict was pronounced – Kasab was found guilty of murder, conspiracy, and of waging war against India (which also carried the death penalty). On 6 May 2010, he was sentenced to death.\n\nA Bombay High Court bench, composed of Justice Ranjanaa Desai and Justice Ranjit More, heard Kasab's appeal against the death penalty and upheld the sentence given by the trial court in their verdict on 21 February 2011. On 30 July 2011, Kasab moved to Supreme Court of India, challenging his conviction and sentence in the case. Thus, a bench composed of Justice Aftab Alam and Justice Chandramouli Kr. Prasad stayed the orders of the Bombay High Court so as to follow the due process of law, and started hearing the case.\n\nOn 29 August 2012, Kasab was found guilty of waging war and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India.\n\nKasab's plea for clemency was rejected by President Pranab Mukherjee on 5 November 2012. On 7 November, Minister of Home Affairs Sushilkumar Shinde confirmed the President's rejection of the petition. The following day, the Maharashtra state government was formally notified and requested to take action. The date of 21 November was then fixed for the execution, and the Indian government faxed their decision to the Pakistani Foreign Office.\n\nEverything so far on secret basis, Kasab was formally informed of his execution on 12 November, after which he requested government officials to inform his mother. On the night of 18–19 November, a senior prison official at Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai read Kasab's death warrant to him, informing him at the same time that his petition for clemency had been rejected. Kasab was then asked to sign his death warrant, which he did. He was secretly transferred under heavy guard to Yerwada Jail in Pune, arriving in the early morning of 19 November. The death and funeral of nationalist politician Bal Thackeray also aided in diverting attention from Kasab. An officer at Arthur Road Jail stated anonymously: \"Throughout the journey from Mumbai to Pune, he did not cause any trouble. Kasab's attitude was of resignation when he came to know that his mercy petition was rejected by the president. Kasab did not shed a single tear during the last few days.\"\n\nOnly the jail superintendent at Yerwada was made aware of Kasab's identity. Kasab was placed in a special cell when he was at Yerwada and no other inmates were informed of his presence. It was only a few minutes before Kasab's execution that the executioner was informed whom he would be hanging.\nThough reportedly nervous in the final minutes before his execution, Kasab remained quiet and offered prayers. He was hanged on 21 November 2012 at 7:30, according to an announcement by Home Minister Shinde. Kasab's execution by the Maharashtra government happened barely two weeks after President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy petition on 5 November.\"\n\nAfter the government contemplated burial at sea, the decision was finally made to bury Kasab at Yerwada Jail. Following his execution, Kasab's body was given to a maulvi for burial in accordance with Islamic rites. Ansar Burney, a human rights activist in Pakistan, later offered to help repatriate Kasab's body to Pakistan citing humanitarian reasons. The Indian government stated it would consider a formal application if offered. Shinde later stated that Kasab's body was buried in India because Pakistan had refused to claim it.\n\nAuthorities in Uttar Pradesh banned all celebrations and public gatherings and placed the state on high alert in response. Similarly, the Coimbatore City Police took a group of people in Coimbatore into preventive custody for celebrating Kasab's execution. K. Unnikrishnan, father of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan, said though the execution was necessary, it was not something to \"rejoice over\" and that the ensuing celebrations were \"foolishness.\"\n\nIn Pakistan, the general and official government response was muted, with the media treating the execution as another news item, according to \"The Hindu\". Though some journalists attempted to elicit statements from villagers in Kasab's village of Faridkot, they met with a hostile response. A senior LeT commander issued an anonymous statement, saying Kasab was a hero who would \"inspire more fighters to follow his path.\" The Pakistani Taliban's spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan issued a statement threatening Indians with retaliation and declaring Kasab would be avenged. Ehsan also made demands for Kasab's body to be returned to his family. \"If they don't return his body to us or his family we will capture Indians and will not return their bodies.\"\n\nWhile commending on the well appreciated role of two women officers in the smooth handling of the execution, Patil later responded to threats to avenge Kasab's death by stating that anybody daring to attack the soil of Maharashtra would meet the same fate.\n\nHafiz Saeed and thousands of others offered \"ghayabana namaz-e-janaza\" (funeral prayers in absentia) for Kasab at a Jamaat-ud-Dawah session in Muridke. Hundreds of others in Srinagar also offered similar prayers at the appeal of Syed Ali Geelani.\n\nMudassir Lakhvi, headmaster of the Government Elementary School in Faridkot village, Okara, appeared before the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on 9 May 2014, during the trial of seven suspects, (Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, Abdul Wajid, Mazhar Iqbal, Hammad Amin Sadiq, Shahid Jameel Riaz, Jamil Ahmed and Younus Anjum), accused of involvement in the attacks on 26 November 2008. He claimed that Ajmal Kasab he knew is alive, and he had met Ajmal only a few days ago. He repeated the claim in 2015.\n\n"}

He received further neurosurgery on 22 August.\n\nKing's parents desired their son be treated with proton therapy, which they felt was less harmful than conventional radiotherapy. At that time the National Health Service (NHS) did not provide proton therapy in the United Kingdom, however it has funded treatment abroad since April 2008 where evidence has shown there to be benefit. In this case the doctors did not support moving the boy so that he could get proton therapy, and in response, on 28 August 2014, the parents took their son out of the hospital without telling the medical team and boarded a ferry to France.\n\nOn 28 August 2014, an international manhunt for King and his parents commenced. On 30 August, King and his parents were found in Velez Malaga, Spain. King's parents were arrested and their son was sent to a local hospital for urgent treatment. They were held in prison for more than 24 hours and released when the request to extradite them to the United Kingdom was withdrawn.\n\nThe issues about treating the boy were brought to the High Court to be resolved, and on 5 September 2014, the court ruled that King could receive proton therapy in Prague. Doctors from Southampton General Hospital said the treatment would have the same side effects as conventional radiotherapy. On 9 September, King arrived at the Proton Therapy Center in Prague, where he underwent proton beam therapy.\n\nIn March 2015, Brett King said that a brain scan showed no evidence that Ashya had a brain tumour.\n\nA 2015 report reviewing the case stated that King's parents' decision to deny their child chemotherapy had reduced his chances of survival by 30 percent. Reviews also called on health providers to do a better job communicating with parents.\n\nIn 2016, following the publication of a prospective phase II trial the NHS decided it will pay for children with medulloblastoma to travel abroad to receive proton therapy.\n\nIn 2018 and MRI scans, conducted in Southampton, showed Ashya to be free of cancer. \n"}

The gay pride parade has been the first in Belgrade since 2001; a planned parade in 2009 was cancelled due to the threat of violence.\n\nAnti-gay and anti-government protesters fought with about 5,000 armed police, throwing Molotov cocktails, bricks, stones, glass bottles and firecrackers; the police used tear gas and rubber bullets. There were no fatalities.\n\nPolice said that 78 police officers and 17 civilians had been injured, and 101 people had been detained for violent behaviour. The garage of the building of the ruling pro-western Democratic Party was set ablaze, and state TV building and the headquarters of other political parties were also damaged. The parade was viewed as a test for the government of Serbia, which has stated it will protect human rights in Serbia as it seeks to become an EU member. Jelko Kacin, presiding over the European Union's evaluation of Serbia, said that Serbia's failure to stop the riot could damage its bid to join the EU.

{"id": "850071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=850071", "title": "Boo.com", "text": "Boo.com\n\nBoo.com was a short-lived, British Internet company, founded in 1998 by Swedes Ernst Malmsten, Kajsa Leander and Patrik Hedelin, who were regarded as sophisticated Internet entrepreneurs in Europe by the investors because they had created an online bookstore named Bokus.com, the third largest book e-retailer (in 1997), before founding the new business Boo.com. \n\nAfter several highly publicized delays, Boo.com launched in the autumn of 1999 selling branded fashion apparel over the Internet. The company spent $135 million of venture capital in just 18 months, and it was placed into receivership on 18 May 2000 and liquidated.\n\nIn June 2008, CNET hailed Boo.com as one of the greatest dot-com busts in history.\n\nErnst Malmsten wrote about the experience in a book called \"Boo Hoo: A dot.com Story from Concept to Catastrophe\", published in 2001.\n\nThe vision of Boo.com was to become the first largest online sports e-retailer around the world and not just as a European brand. It planned to set up stores in both Europe and America simultaneously.\n\nThe brand name was initially suggested as Bo.com, which was inspired by the actor Bo Derek. The final domain name, Boo.com, was bought for $2500 from a dealer as the domain Bo.com was already in use.\n\nThe target customers of Boo.com were young, wealthy and fashionable people between 18 to 24 years old, who were expected to be attracted by sports and fashion brands offered by Boo.com. Boo.com created a virtual shopping assistant, Miss Boo, to assist customers with tips given at each step. Boo.com also developed technology that allowed online customers to put their chosen products onto 3D models and then inspect the result.\n\nThe company had its headquarters along Carnaby Street in London in a building which it initially shared with the \"Erotic Review Magazine\". The company initially had 40 employees. In October 1999, it had a total of eight offices and 400 employees in Amsterdam, Munich, New York City, Paris, and Stockholm. It relaunched in the autumn of 2000 with Kate Buggeln, an ex-Bloomingdale's salesperson and Internet consultant, appointed as president. She told \"Women's Wear Daily\" that they were working to \"expand beyond the portal business model into Boo products and Boo licensing.\"\n\nAlthough there were several months of delays prior to launch and problems with the user experience when boo.com first launched, these had been largely fixed by the time the company entered receivership. Sales had grown rapidly and were around $500,000 for the fortnight prior to the site being shut down.\n\nThe fundamental problem was that the company was following an extremely aggressive growth plan, launching simultaneously in multiple European countries. This plan was founded on the assumption of the ready availability of venture capital money to see the company through the first few years of trading until sales caught up with operating expenses. Such capital ceased to be available for all practical purposes in the second quarter of 2000 following dramatic falls in the NASDAQ presaging the \"dot crash\" following the Dot-com bubble. Boo was one of numerous similar Dot-com company failures over the subsequent two years.\nOne Boo.com manager acknowledges that the company's failure is that global marketing and advertising costs too much, and that managers and technology invest too little. It spent 135 million of its investment in 2 years.\n\nThe boo.com website was widely criticized as poorly designed for its target audience, going against many usability conventions. The site relied heavily on JavaScript and Flash technology to display pseudo-3D views of wares as well as Miss Boo, a sales-assistant-style avatar. The first publicly released version of the site included many large pages; the home page, for example, was several hundred kilobytes which meant that many users had to wait minutes for the site to load, as broadband technologies were not widely available at the time. The site's front page contained the warning, \"this site is designed for 56K modems and above\".\n\nThe complicated design required the site to be displayed in a fixed-size window, which limited the space available to display product information to the customer. Navigation techniques changed as the customer moved around the site.\n\nThe site's interface was complex and included a hierarchical system that required the user to answer four or five different questions before sometimes revealing that there were no products in stock in a particular sub-section. The same basic questions then had to be answered again until results were found.\n\nBoo.com management team can not provide answers of the goal of the website visitors, the conversion percentage, each customer's minimum spend and their purchase cost to one of their going-to-be investor Pequot Capital before launching, and the founder planned to release it with thousands of tasks that some of them need to be done by employees who had not been recruited.\n\nAt the beginning, it was difficult to become a distribution channel of prestigious sports and leisure brands as they have already have their own distribution network with high street and small retailers. These brands also concerned that their brands values would be negatively influenced when their products were sold cheaper on Boo.com or with different price in different countries.\n\n$135 million of marketing investment was used by Boo.com within 18 months in order to set up a worldwide online sport and fashion brands retailer in a short amount of time. Some of the investments are shown below.\n\n1. To attract consumers to shop on Boo.com, it developed a brand new Internet virtual technology with which consumers could drag their intended clothes on the virtual 3D body model and then view it from whatever angles and distance they wanted. The investment in this technology cost Boo.com over $6 million to develop and $0.5 million every month to maintain.\n\n2. Hundreds of staff in many countries were employed and paid for local marketing in order to set up a global brand at the beginning.\n\n3. Boo.com spent $25 million on advertising and public relations marketing before it opened and sold products.\n\nA manager of Boo.com admitted that the failure of the company is also that the global marketing and advertising expenses were too large, and the technology investment was too small. It consumed 135 million of its investment in 2 years.\n\nBoo.com spent £125 million in just six months. Boo.com's sales did not match expectations, due partly to a higher-than-expected rate of product returns (a service that was offered for free, but charged for by their logistics supplier Deutsche Post). Poor management and a lack of communication between departments resulted in rapid growth in costs. The effectiveness of an expensive ad campaign was limited because the website was not ready in time, resulting in curious visitors being greeted with a holding page.\n\nStaff and contractors were recruited in large numbers, with a lack of direction and executive decision about how many people were required, resulting in high payroll costs.\n\nThe biggest loser among boo.com's investors was Omnia, a fund backed by members of Lebanon's wealthy Hariri family, which put nearly £20 million into the company.\n\nCreditors, most of whom were advertising agencies, were owed around £12 million. Over 400 staff and contractors were made redundant in London and around the world, and many had not been paid for several months.\n\nIn a widely circulated article, former Interim CTO Tristan Louis broke down the problems that plagued the company, in one of the first post-mortems of a technology company posted online.\n\nFashionmall.com, which had been operating since 1994, bought the remains of Boo.com, which included brand, Web address and advertising materials but did not include any physical assets, software or distribution channels. The deal also included the Miss Boo character. Boo's main assets, its software and technology, were sold to Bright Station, a British company run by Internet entrepreneur Dan Wagner, for $250,000 and served as the basis for Venda Inc.\nLess than $2 million was earned by selling all Boo's remaining assets.\n\nIn 2005 CNET called Boo.com the sixth greatest dot-com flop.\n\nIn May 2007 Web Reservations International (WRI) turned boo.com into a travel site with reviews and listings. When the new site launched, it already had more than one million user reviews which had been collected from existing WRI travel sites.\n\nIn October 2010, the new boo.com site announced that it was closing down with effect from 1 November 2010.\n\n"}

It eschews the contest approach common to the larger festivals. It brings together hundreds of old-time musicians in a state park setting where the first focus is on educational programs and presentations by scholars and icons of the old-time music worlds. And, of course, jamming. It is presented by the Nashville Old-Time String Band Association, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that began as an offshoot of a community education class in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe first Breakin' Up Winter retreat was just that - an informal gathering of friends who shared an interest in and love for old-time string band music. Fresh from another small old-time gathering in Athens, Alabama, they wanted to create that same atmosphere in Middle Tennessee. The first gathering was held in the Cedar Forest Lodge of the Cedars of Lebanon State Park near Lebanon, Tennessee, about 30 miles outside Nashville. The retreat continues at Cedars of Lebanon, but now encompasses the entire state park. Legendary old-time fiddler Charlie Acuff was a guest of honor at that first event and has been a central artist through the years.\n\nCharlie Acuff was the first in a long line of widely respected \"heritage artists\" - icons of old-time music - to headline Breakin' Up Winter. There developed a theme for the first day of the event - 'Roots of Old-Time Music' - that brings in noted researchers, authors, and performers. \n\nNoted traditional music researcher/author/folklorist Charles Wolfe was a mainstay until his untimely death in 2006.\n\nEach year, the event begins with scholarly presentations by researchers and authors and demonstrations by musicians with deep roots in the music.\n\n\"Participatory music like old-time music involves a great deal of gifting—passing along tunes, playing with others, learning from others, sharing, and coming together for events such as Breakin’ Up Winter to do all of this,\" writes Jeff Todd Titon, professor of ethnomusicology at Brown University.\n\nIn addition to Charlie Acuff and Charles Wolfe, presenters and performers have included: \n\nSome call it \"mountain music\" or \"old-timey\" or \"fiddle tunes.\" It's the heart of this retreat and the mission of the Nashville Old-Time String Band Association: \". . . to preserve, promote, and perform old-time string band music.\" \n\nA flurry of interest in \"old-time\" music in the 1940s, and the folk music revival of the 1960s and 70's, brought millions of new listeners to this traditional music. \n\nBut in the hills and hollows of Appalachia and many communities beyond, it didn't need reviving. It remained the music that people learned to play knee-to-knee with musicians who learned it the same way. There remain many players whose introduction to the music came (and still comes) not from radio or recordings, but through family and friends who themselves who were passing it down directly through the generations. \n\nIt is to those roots of old-time music that this retreat reaches and which is the focus of the first day of the event.\n\nIn 2008, NOTSBA began presenting its Heritage Award to musicians. The first went to Charlie Acuff, the second to Clyde Davenport, the third to Franklin George. The fourth will be presented in 2010 to Lester McCumbers.\n\n\n"}

The campaign video went viral through sharing and social media starting in November 2012.\n\nThe campaign was devised by advertising agency McCann Melbourne. It appeared in newspapers, local radio and outdoor advertising throughout the Metro Trains network and on Tumblr. John Mescall, executive creative director of McCann, said \"The aim of this campaign is to engage an audience that really doesn't want to hear any kind of safety message, and we think \"Dumb Ways To Die\" will.\" McCann estimated that within two weeks, it had generated at least $50 million worth of global media value in addition to more than 700 media stories, for \"a fraction of the cost of one TV ad\". According to Metro Trains, the campaign contributed to a more than 30% reduction in \"near-miss\" accidents, from 13.29 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2011 – January 2012, to 9.17 near-misses per million kilometres in November 2012 – January 2013.\n\nThe video was animated by Julian Frost and produced by Cinnamon Darvall. It was uploaded to YouTube on 14 November 2012 and made public two days later. It featured \"Numpty, Hapless, Pillock, Dippy, Dummkopf, Dimwit, Stupe, Lax, Clod, Doomed, Numskull, Bungle, Mishap, Dunce, Calamity, Ninny, Botch and Doofus killing themselves in increasingly stupid ways\" culminating in the last three characters (Stumble, Bonehead and Putz) being killed by trains due to unsafe behavior. It was viewed 2.5 million times within 48 hours and 4.7 million times within 72 hours. Within two weeks, the video had been viewed 30 million times., the video has received over 171 million views.\n\nMcCann released an \"Official Karaoke Edition\" of the video on 26 November 2012.\n\nThe song \"Dumb Ways to Die\" from the video was written by John Mescall with music by Ollie McGill from The Cat Empire, who also produced it. It was performed by Emily Lubitz, the lead vocalist of Tinpan Orange, with McGill providing backing vocals. The band on the recording consists of Gavin Pearce on Bass, Danny Faruggia on drums and Brett Wood on guitar. It was released on iTunes, attributed to the artist \"Tangerine Kitty\" (a reference to Tinpan Orange and The Cat Empire).\nThe song, with a tempo of 128 beats per minute, is written in C major and a time signature of 4/4.\n\nIn May 2013, Metro released a \"Dumb Ways to Die\" game as an app for iOS devices. The game, developed by Julian Frost and Samuel Baird, invites players to avoid the dangerous activities engaged in by the various characters featured throughout the campaign. Within the app, players can also pledge to \"not do dumb stuff around trains.\" The activities include things like getting toast out with a fork and poking a stick at a grizzly bear.\nAn Android version was also eventually released in September 2013.\n\nThe aim of the game is to earn as many points as possible by avoiding \"dying\" in one of the activities. Lives can be lost by \"dying\" in one of the activities. The player has three chances to prevent the characters from dying.\n\nA sequel titled \"Dumb Ways to Die 2: The Games\" was released on November 14, 2014. In the sequel, there are a lot more varieties of challenges in each particular building, and each building has a particular theme. Before a train arrives at a building, the player plays a challenge to counter something related to trains. If successful, bonus points can be earned at the end of the game. There are 8 challenges each in every building. Like the original game, the game's characters do plenty of dangerous and unsafe activities. Lives can be lost by \"dying\" in one of the activities. The player has three chances to prevent the characters from dying.\n\nA second sequel titled \"Dumb Ways to Die 3: World Tour\" was released on December 21, 2017 and requires the player to collect coins from houses that are fixed up from being initially broken. The houses are fixed by the player playing a new minigame for each area containing those houses.\nSusie O'Brien in the \"Herald Sun\" in Melbourne criticised the ad for trivialising serious injuries and being about advertisers' ego rather than effective safety messages.\n\nSimon Crerar of the \"Herald Sun\" wrote that the song's \"catchy chorus was the most arresting hook since PSY's Gangnam Style.\" Alice Clarke writing in the \"Herald Sun\" described the video as \"adorably morbid\" and wrote that Victoria's public transport \"broke its long running streak of terrible ads\".\n\nDaisy Dumas of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" described it as \"darkly cute — and irksomely catchy\" and the chorus as \"instant earworm material\".\n\nMichelle Starr of CNET described the campaign as the Darwin Awards meets \"The Gashlycrumb Tinies\" and the song as \"a cutesy indie-pop hit in the style of Feist\".\n\nLogan Booker of Gizmodo described it as \"taking a page out of the \"Happy Tree Friends\" book and mixing cute with horrifying\".\n\nKaren Stocks of YouTube Australia said the video was unusual due to the high number of views from mobile devices. Stocks attributed the success to \"A snappy headline. A catchy tune that gets stuck in your head. And a message that is easy to understand and perfectly targeted.\"\n\nThe \"Sunshine Coast Daily\" described it as \"the Gangnam Style of train safety campaigns\".\n\nArlene Paredes of the \"International Business Times\" said the video was \"brilliant in getting viewers' attention\" and \"arguably one of the cutest PSAs ever made.\"\n\nThe campaign received some criticism on the basis that suicide is one of the most influential causes of rail trauma, and the ad reinforces deadly trains as a possible suicide method. Writing in Mumbrella in February 2013, a former employee of Victoria's Department of Infrastructure advised critical thinking when evaluating claims made regarding improvements to safety. Reference was made specifically to the claimed 20 percent reduction in risky behavior as being \"social media bullshit\".\n\nIn February 2013, Artemy Lebedev's blog was censored by Roskomnadzor, the Russian government agency in charge of Internet censorship, for including the video. Later that day, the YouTube video was also censored, with the \"This content is not available in your country due to a legal complaint from the government\" message. The official takedown notice sent to Livejournal.com was quoted, in part, by Lebedev in his blog.\n\nThe song's lyrics contains a description of different ways of committing suicide, such as: using drugs beyond their expiration date, standing on an edge of a platform, running across the rails, eating superglue and other. The animated personages demonstrate dangerous ways of suicide in attractive for children and teenagers comic format. The lines such as \"hide in a dryer” and “What’s this red button do?\" contain an incitement to commit those acts.\n\nDespite this fact, the video was included into the ABC Show and was shown in more than 50 cities of Russia.\n\nThe campaign won seven Webby Awards in 2013 including the Best Animation Film & Video and Best Public Service & Activism (Social Content & Marketing).\n\nIt won three Siren Awards, run by Commercial Radio Australia, including the Gold Siren for best advertisement of the year and Silver Sirens for the best song and best campaign.\n\nThe public service announcement was awarded the Grand Trophy in the 2013 New York Festivals International Advertising Awards.\n\nIn June 2013, the campaign clip won the Integrated Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, and overall, won five Grand Prix awards, 18 Gold Lions, three Silver Lions, and two Bronze Lions, which was the most for the campaign in the festival's history.\n\nWithin two weeks, the video had spawned over 85 parodies. Some renditions and parodies have been featured in national and international media:\n\n\nDue to their success, the Dumb Ways to Die characters have been featured in a promotional campaign for Empire Life Insurance, with their key message being, \"the dumbest way to die is without life insurance.\" However, the campaign was met with mixed reviews, with some advertising critics accusing Metro of \"selling out\" on a successful campaign.\n\nOn 17 October 2014, the Dumb Ways to Die website was revamped to hint at a new installment of the campaign. Slated for release in November 2014, the games take on a more sporting, athletic, and fitness theme, and is labelled \"Dumb Ways to Die 2: The Games\".\n\n"}
{"id": "4773631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4773631", "title": "Elvis: The Concert", "text": "Elvis: The Concert\n\nElvis the Concert is a concert tour started in 1997 that features a video and the voice of Elvis Presley performing with his 1970s backup band via computer technology.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Elvis Presley Enterprises started experimenting with recordings of Elvis' live concerts, and discovered that through the use of sound mixing they were able to eliminate virtually all of the ambient noise from the multitrack recordings, thus leaving only Elvis' voice. After some work, they conceived a special concert, to be held on August 16, 1997, the twentieth Anniversary of Elvis' death. The show featured Elvis' original 1970s back-up band (TCB Band), his back-up singers (The Stamps Quartet, The Imperials, The Sweet Inspirations and Millie Kirkham) and was performed at Memphis, Tennessee's Mid-South Coliseum. During the show, Priscilla Presley introduced a video that Lisa Marie Presley made. The video was of Lisa Marie performing a duet with her father Elvis on the song \"Don't Cry Daddy\". It was so successful that the video was shown again.\n\nThe show was a huge success, gaining worldwide press. The massive success of the show prompted EPE to draw up plans for a special version of the show to take on the road.\n\nStarting in 1998, a scaled-down version of the show was taken on tour. The format of the show follows one of Elvis' 1970s live concerts, albeit somewhat differently.\n\nThe line-up of musicians involved is as follows:\n\nBacking Vocals:\n\nRhythm guitarist John Wilkinson, having suffered a stroke in 1989, was unable to join the band and was replaced by Tony Smith. (However, Wilkinson did join the group at the 25th Anniversary concert, held at the Pyramid in Memphis.)\n\nThe show was conceived by Todd Morgan, Randy Johnson. Joe Guercio and Stig Edgren.\n\n\nThe format of the show begins with the traditional opening theme of Elvis' concerts: \"Also sprach Zarathustra\" by Richard Strauss (better known as the theme to the movie \"\"). This segues into the song \"See See Rider\" from \"\".\n\nThe show is divided into two different acts, each one 45 minutes to an hour, with an intermission between them. The main material used for the shows comes from \"\", \"\", and \"Elvis on Tour\". And in recent years songs from the '68 Comeback Special has been added to the mix, most notably the songs \"Trouble\" (which usually segues into either \"Hound Dog\" or \"That's All Right\"), and \"If I Can Dream\" which is used to end the first act.\n\nDuring the show, a large video screen hangs above the main set upon which the video of Elvis' performance is projected. Two smaller screens hang on either side, and video of the live musicians, or special video packages are shown.\n\nThe first act usually ends with a gospel music segment. If The Imperials are performing, they perform a solo version of \"He Touched Me\". If the Stamps are performing, they perform an a cappella rendition of \"Sweet, Sweet Spirit\" (after an introduction by Elvis from the movie \"Elvis on Tour\"). After that song, a version of \"How Great Thou Art\" by Elvis is played with the band. In early shows, this proved to be problematic: since the audio was taken from the 1974 live album \"Elvis As Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis\", but there was no video footage. Thus, the screen was left black, and only the audio was played. After a few tours, a special piece of footage was made from the 1972 movie \"Elvis on Tour\" which was edited, sped up, and slowed down in a few places in order to have it match up with the 1974 audio.\n\nThe show always ends with Elvis' traditional show closer \"Can't Help Falling in Love\", and the traditional announcement of \"Elvis has Left the Building.\" At the 1997 and 2002 concerts Elvis' former announcer Al Dvorin closed the show by saying \"Elvis has left for Graceland\".\n\nAfter a domestic tour (which ended with a show at the Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, IN, the site of Elvis' final live concert on June 26, 1977), the show went to Europe, Asia, and Australia. \n\nIn 2002, a special 25th anniversary show commemorating the 25th anniversary of Presley's death was held in Memphis, TN at the Pyramid arena. This show was even bigger than the 20th anniversary concert, and featured three different acts. The first act served as a retrospective of Elvis' career from 1956 to 1968. Elvis' former drummer D.J. Fontana made an appearance, playing drums to footage from one of Elvis' appearances on \"The Steve Allen Show\". Saxophonist Boots Randolph made an appearance as well playing sax on \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and on a performance of \"Return to Sender\" (taken from his movie \"Girls! Girls! Girls!\") as part of a special section highlighting Elvis' career in movies.\n\nAct Two showed the gospel side of Elvis. During a special section of gospel music, a surprise was in store for fans as J.D. Sumner's voice was multi-tracked for a performance (with Elvis and the Stamps) of \"Why Me, Lord?\" Lisa Marie also made an appearance singing an original song she wrote called \"Nobody Noticed It (You're Still Lovely)\".\n\nAct 3 was the usual Elvis: the Concert show format and featured new songs, like \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\" from \"That's The Way It Is\" outtakes. This was the only show in which John Wilkinson, who was Elvis' rhythm guitar player from 1969 to 1977, made an appearance.

The main sources of the crusade, the legend of Saint Erik and the legend of Saint Henry, describes that the reason for the crusade were the multiple raids that pagan Finns made to Sweden. \n\nThe crusade has traditionally been seen as the first attempt of Catholic Church and Sweden to convert pagan Finns to Christianity. However, the Christianisation of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian. According to legends, after the crusade Bishop Henry was killed at lake Köyliönjärvi by Lalli. He later became a central figure of the Catholic Church in Finland.\n\nAcademics debate whether this crusade actually took place. No archaeological data give any support for it and earliest written sources are from much later date. No surviving written source describes Swedish influence in Finland before the end of the 13th Century. Furthermore, the diocese and bishop of Finland are not listed among their Swedish counterparts before the 1250s. Also, the Christianisation of the South-western part of Finland is known to have already started in 10th century, and in the 12th century, the area was probably almost entirely Christian.\n\nThe Swedish bishop normally involved in the eastern campaigns was the Bishop of Linköping, not the Bishop of Uppsala.\n\nThe mid-12th century was a very violent time in the northern Baltic sea, with Finnish tribes such as Tavastians and Karelians as well as Swedes in frequent conflicts with Novgorod and with each other. The First Novgorod Chronicle tells that in 1142 a Swedish \"prince\" and bishop accompanied by a fleet of 60 ships plundered just three Novgorodian merchant vessels somewhere \"on the other side of the sea\", obviously being after something more important.\n\nAlmost all years of the 1150`s have been suggested as the year that the crusade possibly took place. Most widely supported years have been years 1150, 1155, 1157 and 1158. Other candidates have been years 1153, 1154 and1156.\n\nAt the time, leading the \"leiðangr\" was the responsibility of the jarl. This gave rise to a theory that Eric conducted the expedition before he became king or pretender to the throne. Legends give no year for the expedition, and attempts to date it to an exact year in the 1150s are all much later speculations. All that is known about King Eric and Bishop Henry is that they most probably held important positions in Sweden some time in the mid-12th century.\n\n"}

The patrol was ambushed and thirteen of its members were killed by the LTTE. This incident sparked the Black July riots and is considered to be the start of the Sri Lankan Civil War.\n\nBy July 1983 tension was rising in the Jaffna Peninsula and throughout the country, the TULF had decided that their Members of Parliament resign their seats and on July 21, 1983 in Parliament, V.N. Navaratnam delivered an emotional farewell address. On the July 23 was a quiet day in Jaffna, even though there were political activity in Mannar. That day at the Army Camp at Gurunagar under the command of Brigadier J.G. Balthazar, the army was preparing an ambush for a LTTE leader \"Sellakili\", who had been engaged in terrorist activities. It was to be carried out by a group of Commandos with the call sign \"Four Four Charlie\", at Kondavil.\n\nPatrol Four Four Bravo was scheduled to leave Gurunagar (code name \"Four Four\") at 2200 hours as a routine patrol from the C Company of the First Battalion of the Sri Lanka Light Infantry based at Madagal about 20 miles away. The patrol arrived at 2147 hours. It consisted of a detachment of 15 soldiers led by Second Lieutenant A.P.N.C. De S. Vaas Gunawardene. The instructions of the Brigadier were that the patrol should be back in Madagal before 2359 hours, if necessary shortening the prescribed route: Gurunagar - Jaffna - Naga Vihara - Nallur - Kopay - Urumpirai - Kondavil - Kokuvil - Jaffna- Kaliyan - kadu - Madagal. 2nd Lt. Gunawardene received the instructions from Major De Silva who further emphasized that the patrol must be in Madagal Camp by midnight. Four Four Bravo left Gurunagar at 2206 hours and was in radio contact every five minutes all reports indicated that Jaffna was quiet.\n\nDuring this time \"Sellakili\" was planning on getting revenge for the death of Charles Lucas Anthony aka Seelan and had observed the army patrols. That night a group of 25 LTTE men, including Velupillai Prabhakaran, Kittu, Iyer, Victor, Pulendran, Shellakili, Santhosam and Appiah gathered at Tinneveli on the Palali - Jaffna road at a point where the road was dug up to install new telecommunication equipment. Near one such excavation four mines were placed and a plunger stolen from the Kankesanturai Cement Factory was placed on the balcony of a nearby house. A machine gun nests were placed near the exploder and across the road. The force was split in two and placed on both sides of the road with Sellakili present.\n\nAt 2328 hours the patrol reported that it was leaving Urumpirai junction and everything was quiet. The patrol was made up of a jeep with 2nd Lt. Vaas Gunawardene, Private N.A.S. Manutange driving and Corporal G.D. Perera and Private S.S. Amarasinghe, Private S.P.G. Rajatillake and Private K.P. Karunaratne in the rear and a Tata Benz half truck with the rest of the patrol with Sergent S.I. Thelakaratne in the front seat with Corporal G.R. Perera at the wheel and Private A.J.R. Fernando between them. Five minutes of leaving Urumpirai the Jeep was slowing down near Tinneveli because of the obstruction on the road due to the installation of telecommunication equipment. As it was passing the excavation on the road, the exploder set off the mines, followed by a hail of machine gun fire on the Jeep and the half-truck. The explosion of the mines wounded many of the men in the jeep including 2nd Lt. Vaas Gunawardene who leapt out of the Jeep and pulled out a hand grenade, but was mowed down by machine gun fire. The rest in the jeep scrambled out attacked the enemy with hand grenades before being killed. Cpl. G.D. Perera charged at the enemy firing his SLR, his body was found a short distance from the jeep.\n\nOn witnessing the explosion the half truck stopped and it too came under fire from both parties of the LTTE. The fire killed Cpl. Perera in the driver's seat, Private Robert, Sunil and Wijesiri in the rear and wounded Private Manapitiya. Sgt. Thelakaratne and Private Fernando who were both wounded scrambled out, took cover from the vehicle and opened fire, however Fernando was soon killed. Thilakaratne kept firing until home-made grenade blew off one hand and all but blew off one foot. Cpl. R. A. U. Perera and Cpl. Sumathipala kept on firing and the latter in addition lobbed his grenade. In his dying moments Private Manapitiya gave his grenade to the Cpl. Sumathipala who changed their magazines and kept on the pressure on the enemy. At one stage they alighted from the vehicle and kept on firing at the enemy in two different directions thus pinning them down. At 2340 hours a message was sent to Brigadier Balthazar that radio contact with the patrol was lost and that a sentry had heard gunfire and explosions in the distance. The Army camps in Palali, Madagal, Thondamanar and Velvettiturai were alerted and the ambush prepared for Four Four Charlie was canceled by the Brigadier. It was sent in search of Four Four Bravo.\n\nFour Four Charlie located the destroyed vehicles at 0009 hours and reported in. Cpl. R. A. U. Perera also telephoned from the Kondavil CTB Depot about that time. He had fired till he ran out ammunition and thereafter had retreated, wounded in both legs. He gave the location of Cpl. Sumathipala, who had also fired till his ammunition was almost expended, and thereafter had retreated and was lying wounded. Brigadier Balthazar himself reached the location, and found Sgt. Thelakaratne in critical condition and sent him to the hospital. He died on the way.\n\n\nThe members of the Four Four Bravo were armed with SLR rifles, except 2nd Lt. Gunawardene who was armed with a sub machine gun and grenades. The LTTE used sub machine guns, repeater shot guns stolen from the Chavakachcheri Police Station. They had with them T56 assault rifle and a SLR rifle.\n"}

Georgia Shakespeare produced plays annually, primarily between June and November. At its peak, it welcomed 60,000 patrons annually to its performances.\n\nGeorgia Shakespeare was founded in 1985 by Lane Anderson, Richard Garner, and Robert Watson under the name \"Georgia Shakespeare Festival\". The company produced two plays each year, with its first offering being productions of \"The Taming of the Shrew\" and \"King Lear\" in rotating repertory starting July 10, 1986.\n\nThe rising theatre company went through several locations in its first years. Its first season was on the Oglethorpe University front athletic field in a rectangular, white 60' X 90' tent with a seating capacity of 300. The theatre changed tents for its second season and was housed in a circular tent with a 90' diameter. This new tent increased the seating capacity by 50. For the theatre's fifth season, it moved into a 110' diameter circular tent that seated 400.\n\nIn 1991, Georgia Shakespeare expanded to three plays annually, and performed an adaptation of \"The Three Musketeers\" as its first work not written by William Shakespeare. In later years, the company has performed between three and seven plays per season.\n\nIn 1997, Georgia Shakespeare opened its season in the $5.7 million John A. and Miriam H. Conant Performing Arts Center with \"The Tempest\". The Conant Center has a 509-seat modified thrust stage and it was this move that allowed the addition of a fall performance to the season schedule.\n\nIn 2001, Georgia Shakespeare became a member of the League of Resident Theaters. At the time, it was one of only two theatres in the state of Georgia to be a part of this league.\n\nIn 2011, mired in debt, the theatre launched a 'Save Georgia Shakespeare' campaign which was successful in raising over $500,000.\n\nIn 2014, the theatre company closed for good in the middle of its 29th season, unable to stay open due to its high debts.\n\n1986\n1987\n1988\n1989\n1990\n1991\n1992\n1993\n1994\n1995\n1996\n1997\n1998\n1999\n2000\n2001\n2002\n2003\n2004\n2005\n2006\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014 (Final Season)\n\nTwelve educational programs were developed in the history of Georgia Shakespeare. These programs included \"The High School Tour\", a \"High School Acting Competition\", \"Camp Shakespeare\", a \"High School Conservatory\", a \"No Fear Shakespeare\" training program for educators, after school residencies, school tours, student matinees, classes for professionals, and in-school workshops.\n\nWhen Georgia Shakespeare was still performing under a tent, patrons of the theatre started bringing pre-show picnics. This became a tradition and when the Conant Performing Arts Center was built, a covered area with tables and chairs was set aside for picnics. In 2014, the grounds underwent a renovation funded through several Atlanta-area Private Foundations.\n\n\nGeorgia Shakespeare had a core group of artists who, in 2014, had been with them between six and twenty-nine years and help define the theatre's identity.

The first issue debuted on September 26, 2018.\n\n\"Heroes in Crisis\" is a nine-issue limited series being written by Tom King, who has worked on DC Vertigo titles, \"Batman\", and \"Mister Miracle\", and illustrated by Clay Mann. It will be published by DC Comics; cover art will be provided by Mann, J. G. Jones, Mark Brooks, and Francesco Mattina. The series follows the \"Crisis\" naming conventions of prior DC crossovers, but unlike prior \"Crisis\" events, \"Heroes in Crisis\" will not focus on a cosmic threat. Instead, it expands on a concept King introduced in \"Batman\", the rehabilitation center the Sanctuary, which is based on veterans' crisis centers.\n\nAccording to King, the idea for \"Heroes in Crisis\" was conceived in 2016 after he suffered from a panic attack and went to the hospital, and his grandmother (who raised him) died on the same day. King had to go through therapy, after which he decided to use what he learned in a DC comic. The homestead of the Sanctuary on the cover of \"Heroes in Crisis\" #1 is modeled after his grandmother's house as a tribute to her.\n\n\"Heroes in Crisis\" primarily deals with the emotional cost of being a superhero and will explore \"what violence does to a society\", a common theme in King's work. King, a former CIA counterterrorism officer, believed this was an important subject that needed to be discussed. \"Comic books, throughout the whole history of the medium, have been reflective of history. In World War II, there were comics about fighting in World War II. In the seventies, the comics were about psychedelic escape. Unfortunately, our moment right now is a moment of violence and living with violence and our comics have to address that,\" he said.\n\nRumors of a new DC event with the \"Crisis\" naming surfaced in May 2018. The rumors were quickly denied by DC Comics co-publisher Jim Lee, who tweeted \"Rumors of reboots are ridiculous. Just stop with the misinformation.

{"id": "72331", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=72331", "title": "Karōshi", "text": "Karōshi\n\n, which can be translated literally as \"overwork death\" in Japanese, is occupational sudden mortality. The major medical causes of \"karōshi\" deaths are heart attack and stroke due to stress and a starvation diet. This phenomenon is also widespread in other parts of Asia as well.\n\nThe first case of \"karōshi\" was reported in 1969 with the stroke-related death of a 29-year-old male worker in the shipping department of Japan's largest newspaper company. The term was invented in 1978 to refer to an increasing number of people suffering from fatal strokes and heart attacks attributed to overwork. A book on the issue in 1982 brought the term into public usage.\n\nIt was not until the mid to late 1980s, during the Bubble Economy, when several high-ranking business executives who were still in their prime years suddenly died without any previous sign of illness, that the term emerged into Japanese public life. This new phenomenon was immediately seen as a new and serious menace for people in the work force. In 1987, as public concern increased, the Japanese Ministry of Labour began to publish statistics on \"karōshi\".\n\nIn 1988, the Labor Force Survey reported that almost one fourth of the male working employees worked over 60 hours per week, which is 50% longer than a typical 40-hour weekly working schedule. Realizing the seriousness and widespread nature of this emerging problem, a group of lawyers and doctors set up “karoshi hotlines” that are nationally available, dedicating to help those who seek consultation on karoshi related issues.\n\nJapan's rise from the devastation of World War II to economic prominence and the huge war reparations they have paid in the post-war decades have been regarded as the trigger for what has been called a new epidemic. It was recognized that employees cannot work for 12 or more hours a day, 6–7 days a week, year after year, without suffering physically as well as mentally. It is common for the overtime to go unpaid.\n\nIn an International Labour Organization article about \"karōshi\", the following four typical cases of \"karōshi\" were mentioned:\nAs well as physical pressure, mental stress from the workplace can cause \"karōshi\". People who commit suicide due to mental stress are called \"\"karōjisatsu\" (過労自殺).\" The ILO also lists some causes of overwork or occupational stress that include the following:\n\nIn a 1988 report published by the Karoshi Hotline Network, the majority of the clients who consulted were not workers, but the wives of the workers who had either passed away because of karoshi or were at high risk of doing so. This indicated that those who were stressed out by work either did not realize the cause was overworking or were under social pressure to not express it explicitly by seeking help.\n\nThe Karoshi Hotline received the highest number of calls when it was first established in 1988. From 1988 to 1990, there were a total number of 1806 calls received. From 1990 to 2007, the number of calls received per year decreased, but still maintained an average of 400 calls per year. Its availability is nationwide, ranging from Hokkaido(北海道) to Kanto(関東).\n\nSuicide can be induced by overwork-related stresses or when businessmen are laid off from their jobs. The deceased person's relatives demand compensation payments when such deaths occur. Life insurance companies started putting one-year exemption clauses in their contracts. They did this so that the person must wait one year to commit suicide in order to receive the money.\n\nThere is a new movement of Japanese workers, formed as a result of \"karōshi\". Young Japanese are choosing part-time work, contrary to their elder counterparts who work overtime. This is a new style of career choice for the young Japanese people who want to try out different jobs in order to figure out their own potential. These individuals work for \"hourly wages rather than regular salaries,\" and are called \"freeters.\" The number of freeters has increased throughout the years, from 200,000 in the 1980s to about 400,000 in 1997.\n\nFreeters undergo a special kind of employment, defined by Atsuko Kanai as those who are currently employed and referred to as \"part-time workers or arbeit (temporary workers), who are currently employed but wish to be employed as part time workers, or who are currently not in the labor force and neither doing housework nor attending school but wish to be employed as part-time workers.\" Freeters are not in school, are aged 15–34, and if they are women, are unmarried. The movement of the freeters has its problems, however. Most freeters fail to launch successful careers, based on a few factors.\n\nDue to their part-time work, their annual income is around 1 million yen, or around $8,500 USD. Also, economic growth in Japan is slow, making it difficult for freeters to switch to regular employment. Another problem is that freeters are given menial tasks, which makes it almost impossible to gain any real experience, which is necessary when converting to full-time employment. (Kanai, 2003) It may seem as if being a freeter is the answer to the overworked, near-\"karōshi\" individual suffering from long work hours. Those who are being non-regular employees or freeters who are supposedly wanting to only work part-time are finding themselves working 60 hours a week or more. Since non-regular employees' wages are so low, it is necessary for them to work longer hours, negating the desire to be a freeter. Freeters are now facing the risk of \"karōshi\", just as regular workers have, due to their long hours.\n\nThere are other undesirable results, other than \"karōshi\", that arise from working long hours. A psychological trait known as workaholism has been shown to lead one to work long hours. (Spence & Robbins, 1992) There are three defining factors of workaholism: high work involvement, being driven to or compelled to work by inner pressures, and low enjoyment of work. (Kanai, 1996). The last of these factors suggests a contradiction. However, Kanai argued that workaholism is not a psychological trait, but rather results from adaptation to that work demand overload. Individuals that overload on work are not doing so because they are workaholics, but that the demand of the workload brings out psychologically and behavioral characteristics similar to those with workaholism. Management welcomes hard work and rewards with promotions. Morioka (2005), suggests that in order to eliminate the harmful effects of workaholism, the workplace should be responsible for managing workload issues.\n\nOverworking also has a negative effect on the family. Men who become too busy with their jobs think less about their family. High levels of family depression exist as a result. As the men focus on their jobs, they tend to develop negative feelings towards family. They take on less of a role in family life as they continue to overwork. The men see the family as something that is taking away from their work, which creates a resentment toward the family. As a result, avoidance of family time increases, even though it is their family that inspires them to work hard in the first place (Kanai, 2002). Kanai's findings suggest that excessive working hours are harmful to family life, not only in that are they spending less time with their families, but that they also develop hostility towards the family.\n\nHowever, it could also be said that the men had taken on these jobs for the sake of providing for their family, but ultimately become less effective as a resource due to their exhaustion and complete focus on earning money. It is likely salarymen go into that lifestyle simply for the money, because the jobs pay well; if they work long hours, they can earn large sums of money and send it to their families to help provide for them, since in traditional Japanese families, the father is usually the main worker in the household. In an interview, a man had said that \"the best thing about being born male was, 'having a family, and being able to support that family.' Conversely the worst thing was 'being unable to quit your job even if you want to' due to the same responsibility.\" The responsibility men have to provide for the family correlates with their masculinity, so if a man gets laid off he may think that \"their own ability is really poor, and would get quite depressed.\" These pressures are ones that society puts on them, since it is expected that the men work and provide for the family.\n\nThe Cabinet Office analyzes the Household Survey on the Quality of Life to examine how large of an impact overwork has on health issues, including karoshi. The study finds that a long weekly working schedule, which is defined as over 60 hours for men and over 45 hours for women, significantly increased the anxiety of employees who believe they will be suffering from health issues. In other words, regardless of whether employees had health issues, merely working for longer hours created anxiety towards perceived health issues. The 15-hour gap between men and women does not mean that women are less capable of dealing with stress, but is because of the traditional Japanese value that puts the burden of taking care of children and other mundane household tasks on women. Women thus have much larger range of responsibilities to be concerned with, in addition to their everyday jobs.\n\nThe suicide prevention hotline in Japan is often so busy, callers occasionally have to try between 30 and 40 times until they can get an answer. Each year, roughly 30,000 people in Japan commit suicide. A potential reason why the number is so high could be the kind of camaraderie involved in the process of committing suicide, where people will spend time searching online to find other suicidal individuals and then \"make plans to die together.\"\n\nTo provide a strategic plan on how to decreases the rate of karoshi, the National Institute of Health proposed the establishment of a comprehensive industrial health service program to reduce karoshi and other disease caused by work-related stress in its 2005 annual report. The program requires communal efforts from three different groups, the government, the labour unions and employers, and the employees. The government, as the policy maker, should promote shorter working hours, make health services readily accessible, encourage voluntary health examination and enhance the effectiveness of medical care. As the group that is more closely involved with the everyday health of employees, labour unions and employers should strive to implement and comply with government policies that focus on reducing work overtime and create a better work environment. The employees themselves should recognize their needs to take rests promptly and take preventative measures as needed.\n\nAs a formal response to this proposal, the Industry Safety and Health Act was revised in 2006. The Act established various terms that focus on work-related health issues, including mandatory health checks and consultations with professional medical personnel for employees who work long hours and have a higher possibility of having work related illness. It might seem to be an odd decision, speaking from an economic standpoint, to use government policy to force companies to reduce work hours. It seems to be counterproductive of the profit maximizing nature of market economy. This counterintuitive intervention, according to Yoshio Higuchi, is attributed to the several factors unique to the Japanese society. Traditionally, Japanese workers are very loyal employees.\n\nIt is very common for someone to work for the same company from a freshly out of school graduate to a nearly retired man. The society also views those who constantly change jobs with skeptical eyes. Such discouragement directly caused the difficulty in moving into new jobs. Thus, companies usually have a much higher bargaining power when it comes to “exploiting” their employees. In order to cut costs, companies would usually demand their employees work for longer hours instead of hiring someone to take over part of the workload. Therefore, if the government does not intervene and mandate companies to reduce working time, no orders would be taken seriously.\n\nThe current Labor Standards Act is not effective if the majority of the representative employees agree with working over 40 hours per week, despite clauses in the Act prohibits such overtime. A study by the Cabinet Office of the Economic and Social Research Institute of Japan (the Cabinet Office) pointed out that refusing to consent with the ILO's treaty on work time regulations could be a large contributing factor to the current state of the labor market.\n\nA Japanese businessman, also known as a salaryman (サラリーマン, \"sararīman\"), is often a victim of \"karōshi\" due to the strenuous work hours their job requires, in addition to the mandatory after-hours socializing and drinking that their jobs require. Often these salarymen are invited to nomikai, or \"drinking parties,\" to build better connections between coworkers in the company. According to an article on Gaijinpot, \"A common saying in Japan is, 'if you want to work your way up the corporate ladder you have to drink.' This was how many older generation workers established relationships and considered this the normal way of doing business.\"\n\nAccording to these values, a key to business success was a willingness to go out and participate in this mandatory socializing with coworkers. Since not everyone can keep up with the pace and immersion of salaryman life, stress-induced death became fairly common. Due to this high-stress nature of a salaryman's job, death by cardivascular diseases or mental disorders were some of the two biggest factors.\n\nSince Japanese businessmen are under a lot of work-related pressures, \"karōshi\" suicides have increased, especially due to economic crises. Even those that were able to keep their jobs, after their company laid off multiple employees, experienced a large increase in work. \"In 2000, 28% of regular Japanese employees worked 50 hours or more per week, compared to 16% to 21% in New Zealand, USA, Australia and the UK and less than 6% in 13 other industrialized nations.\"\n\nBusinessmen in Japan have been overworked, but physicians specifically have been feeling great pressures of being overworked, while still facing a moral obligation to continue. Physicians work an average of 65 hours a week or more. \"They are reaching the limit in terms of the number of service hours they can provide without risking their own health.” The government used to have restrictions on the number of physicians that could attend medical school, but now they have increased medical school enrollment. It takes years for physicians to become qualified, so it is critical that alternative measures come into play before \"karōshi\" takes a toll on physicians in Japan.\n\nA number of companies have been making an effort to find a better work-life balance for their employees. Toyota, for example, now generally limits overtime to 360 hours a year (an average of 30 hours monthly), and, at some offices, issues public address announcements every hour after 7 p.m. pointing out the importance of rest and urging workers to go home. Nissan offers telecommuting for office workers to make it easier to care for children or elderly parents. Dozens of large corporations have also implemented \"no overtime days\", which require employees to leave the office promptly at 5:30 p.m. However, since their workload is too high, few workers can actually take advantage of this, and opt to stay in the office with the lights off or to simply take their work home, \"cloaked overtime\" called \"furoshiki\" (風呂敷) after the Japanese traditional wrapping cloth.\n\nIn 2007, Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking, a division of Japan's largest banking group, started to allow employees to go home up to 3 hours early to care for children or elderly relatives. As of January 5, 2009, just 34 of the company's 7,000 employees had signed up for the plan.\n\nIn February 2017, Japanese Government launched a campaign called \"Premium Friday\" asking companies to allow their workers to leave at 3pm on the last Friday of the month. The initiative is part of an attempt to address the punishingly long hours many Japanese are expected to work, prompted by the suicide of a 24-year-old employee at the advertising firm Dentsu who was doing more than 100 hours' overtime in the months before her death. While some major companies, such as Honda, the drinks maker Suntory and the confectioner Morinaga, have adopted the optional scheme, others are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a mid-afternoon staff exodus. A survey of 155 big companies by the Nikkei business newspaper showed that 45% had no immediate plans to implement the scheme, with 37% saying they had either decided to enter into the spirit of Premium Friday or had plans to do so.\n\nThe problem with unpaid overtime in companies is that the overtime is simply not recorded in many cases. The amount of overtime is regulated by labor regulations, so, in order to not contradict labor regulations, workers are told not to record the overtime, since it would be considered an illegal action from the side of the company. The workers themselves often rationalize this by attributing the overwork to lacking skills from their side, describing a lack of familiarity with the work, \"not being trained enough\" as the cause for not being able to finish in a more timely manner. In general, overtime is something that is accepted as part of work, and protest against it is rare, due to concern for the reaction of colleagues, superiors and even family and friends.\n\n\"Seken\" (世間), or the \"public gaze\" (others' opinions about one's behavior) is a strong cultural factor in this. It is safe to assume that most statistics of overtime in Japanese companies are not accurate, since overtime is not recorded in many occasions. It is not uncommon for many Japanese employees to work late hours until 2-3am, and being expected to be in the office again at 9am. In some cases (especially in subsidiaries of big listed companies that have to cope with the pressure of parent companies, who generate margins through exploitation of daughter companies) employees have been reported to have worked 300 hours of overtime in a single month. These statistics are in almost all cases not official, and most employees would always refrain from making such statements to authorities or the press, nor would they agree to be named.\n\nIn China, the analogous \"death by overwork\" concept is guolaosi (Traditional:過勞死 Simplified:过劳死), which in 2014 was reported to be a problem in the country.\nIn Eastern Asian countries, like China, many businessmen work long hours and then feel the pressures of expanding and pleasing their networks. Making these connections is called building guanxi. Connections are a big part of the Chinese business world, and throughout different parts of China, businessmen would meet up in teahouses to take their job outside of the work atmosphere. It was important for businessmen to broaden their guanxi relationships, especially with powerful officials or bosses.\n\nThere is a lot of pressure to go to these nightclubs almost every night to drink heavily to move up in the business world. It has been shown that this kind of work could lead to health related problems down the line. For example, a businessman named Mr. Pan discussed with John Osburg, an anthropologist who wrote “Anxious Wealth: Money and Morality Among China's New Rich,” about his health and the need to continue working. Mr. Pan, the 'biggest boss in Chengdu,' was in the hospital for 'excessive drinking.' This has happened to him before. Mr. Pan said, “I can't stop or slow down. I have many people whose livelihoods depend on me (literally 'depend on me to eat.'). I've got about fifty employees and even more brothers. Their livelihoods depend on my success. I have to keep going.”\n\nIn South Korea, the term gwarosa (과로사) is also used to refer to death by overworking. South Korea has some of the longest working hours in the world, even more so than Japan with the average being 68. This has caused many workers to feel the pressure of their jobs which has taken a toll on both their physical and mental health. Many have died from being overworked and the issue has only begun to gain more national attention due to many government workers having died from gwarosa. In order to reduce many problems caused from overworking, the government enacted a law cutting the working hours from 68 to 52.\n\nThe French-German TV channel Arte showed a documentary called \"Alt in Japan\" (Old in Japan) on 6 November 2006 dealing with older workers in Japan. In 2008, \"karōshi\" again made headlines: a death back in 2006 of a key Toyota engineer who averaged over 80 hours overtime each month was ruled the result of overwork. His family was awarded benefits after his case was reviewed.\n\nTaiwanese media have reported a case of \"karōshi\". An engineer had worked for Nanya Technology for 3 years from 2006 to 2009. It was found that he died in front of his computer which was surrounded by company documents. The prosecution found that the engineer had died of cardiogenic shock. The engineer's parents said that he had usually worked for 16–19 hours a day. CNN shows another reported case of \"karōshi\" in Taiwan. This short clip called \"The Dangers of Overwork\" shows a man who suffered a stroke and was left for three hours until taken to the hospital. It was made known that physicians are starting to make people more aware of these health deficits due to overworking. More people have been visiting their doctor, recognizing these signs and symptoms.\n\n\nGeneral:\n\n"}

{"id": "162780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=162780", "title": "Megafauna", "text": "Megafauna\n\nIn terrestrial zoology, megafauna (from Greek μέγας \"megas\" \"large\" and New Latin \"fauna\" \"animal life\") are large or giant animals. The most common thresholds used are weight over or (i.e., comparable or larger in mass than a human) or over a tonne, (i.e., comparable or larger in mass than an ox). The first of these include many species not popularly thought of as overly large, such as white-tailed deer and red kangaroo.\n\nIn practice, the most common usage encountered in academic and popular writing describes land mammals roughly larger than a human that are not (solely) domesticated. The term is especially associated with the Pleistocene megafauna – the land animals often larger than modern counterparts considered archetypical of the last ice age, such as mammoths, the majority of which in northern Eurasia, the Americas and Australia became extinct within the last forty thousand years. It is also commonly used for the largest extant wild land animals, especially elephants, giraffes, hippopotamuses, rhinoceroses, and large bovines. (Of these five categories of large herbivorous mammals, only bovines are presently found outside of Africa and southern Asia, but all the others were formerly more wide-ranging.) Megafauna may be subcategorized by their trophic position into megaherbivores (e.g., elephants), megacarnivores (e.g., lions), and, more rarely, megaomnivores (e.g., bears).\n\nOther common uses are for giant aquatic species, especially whales, any larger wild or domesticated land animals such as larger antelope and cattle, as well as numerous dinosaurs and other extinct giant reptilians.\n\nThe term is also sometimes applied to animals (usually extinct) of great size \"relative to\" a more common or surviving type of the animal, for example the dragonflies of the Carboniferous period.\n\nMegafauna – in the sense of the largest mammals and birds – are generally K-strategists, with high longevity, slow population growth rates, low mortality rates, and (at least for the largest) few or no natural predators capable of killing adults. These characteristics, although not exclusive to such megafauna, make them vulnerable to human overexploitation, in part because of their slow population recovery rates.\n\nOne observation that has been made about the evolution of larger body size is that rapid rates of increase that are often seen over relatively short time intervals are not sustainable over much longer time periods. In an examination of mammal body mass changes over time, the maximum increase possible in a given time interval was found to scale with the interval length raised to the 0.25 power. This is thought to reflect the emergence, during a trend of increasing maximum body size, of a series of anatomical, physiological, environmental, genetic and other constraints that must be overcome by evolutionary innovations before further size increases are possible. A strikingly faster rate of change was found for large decreases in body mass, such as may be associated with the phenomenon of insular dwarfism. When normalized to generation length, the maximum rate of body mass decrease was found to be over 30 times greater than the maximum rate of body mass increase for a ten-fold change.\n\nSubsequent to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated the non-avian dinosaurs about Ma (million years) ago, terrestrial mammals underwent a nearly exponential increase in body size as they diversified to occupy the ecological niches left vacant. Starting from just a few kg before the event, maximum size had reached ~50 kg a few million years later, and ~750 kg by the end of the Paleocene. This trend of increasing body mass appears to level off about 40 Ma ago (in the late Eocene), suggesting that physiological or ecological constraints had been reached, after an increase in body mass of over three orders of magnitude. However, when considered from the standpoint of rate of size increase per generation, the exponential increase is found to have continued until the appearance of \"Indricotherium\" 30 Ma ago. (Since generation time scales with \"body mass\", increasing generation times with increasing size cause the log mass vs. time plot to curve downward from a linear fit.)\n\nMegaherbivores eventually attained a body mass of over 10,000 kg. The largest of these, indricotheres and proboscids, have been hindgut fermenters, which are believed to have an advantage over foregut fermenters in terms of being able to accelerate gastrointestinal transit in order to accommodate very large food intakes. A similar trend emerges when rates of increase of maximum body mass per generation for different mammalian clades are compared (using rates averaged over macroevolutionary time scales). Among terrestrial mammals, the fastest rates of increase of \"body mass\" vs. time (in Ma) occurred in perissodactyls (a slope of 2.1), followed by rodents (1.2) and proboscids (1.1), all of which are hindgut fermenters. The rate of increase for artiodactyls (0.74) was about a third that of perissodactyls. The rate for carnivorans (0.65) was slightly lower yet, while primates, perhaps constrained by their arboreal habits, had the lowest rate (0.39) among the mammalian groups studied.\n\nTerrestrial mammalian carnivores from several eutherian groups (the artiodactyl \"Andrewsarchus\" - formerly considered a mesonychid, the creodonts \"Megistotherium\" and \"Sarkastodon\", and the carnivorans \"Amphicyon\" and \"Arctodus\") all reached a maximum size of about 1000 kg (the carnivoran \"Arctotherium\" apparently actually got somewhat larger). The largest known metatherian carnivore, \"Proborhyaena gigantea\", apparently reached 600 kg, also close to this limit. A similar theoretical maximum size for mammalian carnivores has been predicted based on the metabolic rate of mammals, the energetic cost of obtaining prey, and the maximum estimated rate coefficient of prey intake. It has also been suggested that maximum size for mammalian carnivores is constrained by the stress the humerus can withstand at top running speed.\n\nAnalysis of the variation of maximum body size over the last 40 Ma suggests that decreasing temperature and increasing continental land area are associated with increasing maximum body size. The former correlation would be consistent with Bergmann's rule, and might be related to the thermoregulatory advantage of large body mass in cool climates, better ability of larger organisms to cope with seasonality in food supply, or other factors; the latter correlation could be explained in terms of range and resource limitations. However, the two parameters are interrelated (due to sea level drops accompanying increased glaciation), making the driver of the trends in maximum size more difficult to identify.\n\nSince tetrapods (first reptiles, later mammals) returned to the sea in the Late Permian, they have dominated the top end of the marine body size range, due to the more efficient intake of oxygen possible using lungs. The ancestors of cetaceans are believed to have been the semiaquatic pakicetids, no larger than wolves, of about 53 million years (Ma) ago. By 40 Ma ago, cetaceans had attained a length of 20 m or more in \"Basilosaurus\", an elongated, serpentine whale that differed from modern whales in many respects and was not ancestral to them. Following this, the evolution of large body size in cetaceans appears to have come to a temporary halt, and then to have backtracked, although the available fossil records are limited. However, in the period from 31 Ma ago (in the Oligocene) to the present, cetaceans underwent a significantly more rapid sustained increase in body mass (a rate of increase in \"body mass\" of a factor of 3.2 per million years) than achieved by any group of terrestrial mammals. This trend led to the largest animal of all time, the modern blue whale. Several reasons for the more rapid evolution of large body size in cetaceans are possible. Fewer biomechanical constraints on increases in body size may be associated with suspension in water as opposed to standing against the force of gravity, and with swimming movements as opposed to terrestrial locomotion. Also, the greater heat capacity and thermal conductivity of water compared to air may increase the thermoregulatory advantage of large body size in marine endotherms, although diminishing returns apply.\n\nCetaceans are not the only marine mammals to reach unprecedented size in the modern era. The largest carnivoran of all time is the mostly aquatic modern southern elephant seal.\n\nBecause of the small initial size of all mammals following the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, nonmammalian vertebrates had a roughly ten-million-year-long window of opportunity (during the Paleocene) for evolution of gigantism without much competition. During this interval, apex predator niches were often occupied by reptiles, such as terrestrial crocodilians (e.g. \"Pristichampsus\"), large snakes (e.g. \"Titanoboa\") or varanid lizards, or by flightless birds (e.g. \"Paleopsilopterus\" in South America). This is also the period when megafaunal flightless herbivorous gastornithid birds evolved in the Northern Hemisphere, while flightless paleognaths evolved to large size on Gondwanan land masses and Europe. Gastornithids and at least one lineage of flightless paleognath birds originated in Europe, both lineages dominating niches for large herbivores while mammals remained below 45 kg (in contrast with other landmasses like North America and Asia, which saw the earlier evolution of larger mammals) and were the largest European tetrapods in the Paleocene.\n\nFlightless paleognaths, termed ratites, have traditionally been viewed as representing a lineage separate from that of their small flighted relatives, the Neotropic tinamous. However, recent genetic studies have found that tinamous nest well within the ratite tree, and are the sister group of the extinct moa of New Zealand. Similarly, the small kiwi of New Zealand have been found to be the sister group of the extinct elephant birds of Madagascar. These findings indicate that flightlessness and gigantism arose independently multiple times among ratites via parallel evolution.\n\nPredatory megafaunal flightless birds were often able to compete with mammals in the early Cenozoic. Later in the Cenozoic, however, they were displaced by advanced carnivorans and died out. In North America, the bathornithids \"Paracrax\" and \"Bathornis\" were apex predators but became extinct by the Early Miocene. In South America, the related phorusrhacids shared the dominant predatory niches with metatherian sparassodonts during most of the Cenozoic but declined and ultimately went extinct after eutherian predators arrived from North America (as part of the Great American Interchange) during the Pliocene. In contrast, large herbivorous flightless ratites have survived to the present.\n\nHowever, none of the largest predatory (\"Brontornis\"), possibly omnivorous (\"Dromornis\") or herbivorous (\"Aepyornis\") flightless birds of the Cenozoic ever grew to masses much above 500 kg, and thus never attained the size of the largest mammalian carnivores, let alone that of the largest mammalian herbivores. It has been suggested that the increasing thickness of avian eggshells in proportion to egg mass with increasing egg size places an upper limit on the size of birds. The largest species of \"Dromornis\", \"D. stirtoni\", may have gone extinct after it attained the maximum avian body mass and was then outcompeted by marsupial diprotodonts that evolved to sizes several times larger.\n\nGiant tortoises were very important components of late Cenozoic faunas, occurring in virtually every continent until the arrival of homininans. The largest known terrestrial tortoise was \"Megalochelys atlas\", an animal that probably weighed about 1,000 kg.\n\nSome earlier aquatic Testudines, e.g. the marine \"Archelon\" of the Cretaceous and freshwater \"Stupendemys\" of the Miocene, were considerably larger, weighing more than 2,000 kg.\n\nThe Holocene extinction (see also Quaternary extinction event), occurred at the end of the last ice age glacial period (a.k.a. the Würm glaciation) when many giant ice age mammals, such as woolly mammoths, went extinct in the Americas and northern Eurasia. An analysis of the extinction event in North America found it to be unique among Cenozoic extinction pulses in its selectivity for large animals. Various theories have attributed the wave of extinctions to human hunting, climate change, disease, a putative extraterrestrial impact, or other causes. However, this extinction near the end of the Pleistocene was just one of a series of megafaunal extinction pulses that have occurred during the last 50,000 years over much of the Earth's surface, with Africa and southern Asia (where the local megafauna had a chance to evolve alongside modern humans) being comparatively less affected. The latter areas did suffer a gradual attrition of megafauna, particularly of the slower-moving species (a class of vulnerable megafauna epitomized by giant tortoises), over the last several million years.\n\nOutside the mainland of Afro-Eurasia, these megafaunal extinctions followed a highly distinctive landmass-by-landmass pattern that closely parallels the spread of humans into previously uninhabited regions of the world, and which shows no overall correlation with climatic history (which can be visualized with plots over recent geological time periods of climate markers such as or ). Australia and nearby islands (e.g., Flores) were struck first around 46,000 years ago, followed by Tasmania about 41,000 years ago (after formation of a land bridge to Australia about 43,000 years ago), Japan apparently about 30,000 years ago, North America 13,000 years ago, South America about 500 years later, Cyprus 10,000 years ago, the Antilles 6,000 years ago, New Caledonia and nearby islands 3,000 years ago, Madagascar 2,000 years ago, New Zealand 700 years ago, the Mascarenes 400 years ago, and the Commander Islands 250 years ago. Nearly all of the world's isolated islands could furnish similar examples of extinctions occurring shortly after the arrival of humans, though most of these islands, such as the Hawaiian Islands, never had terrestrial megafauna, so their extinct fauna were smaller.\n\nAn analysis of the timing of Holarctic megafaunal extinctions and extirpations over the last 56,000 years has revealed a tendency for such events to cluster within interstadials, periods of abrupt warming, but only when humans were also present. Humans may have impeded processes of migration and recolonization that would otherwise have allowed the megafaunal species to adapt to the climate shift. In at least some areas, interstadials were periods of expanding human populations.\n\nAn analysis of \"Sporormiella\" fungal spores (which derive mainly from the dung of megaherbivores) in swamp sediment cores spanning the last 130,000 years from Lynch's Crater in Queensland, Australia, showed that the megafauna of that region virtually disappeared about 41,000 years ago, at a time when climate changes were minimal; the change was accompanied by an increase in charcoal, and was followed by a transition from rainforest to fire-tolerant sclerophyll vegetation. The high-resolution chronology of the changes supports the hypothesis that human hunting alone eliminated the megafauna, and that the subsequent change in flora was most likely a consequence of the elimination of browsers and an increase in fire. The increase in fire lagged the disappearance of megafauna by about a century, and most likely resulted from accumulation of fuel once browsing stopped. Over the next several centuries grass increased; sclerophyll vegetation increased with a lag of another century, and a sclerophyll forest developed after about another thousand years. During two periods of climate change about 120,000 and 75,000 years ago, sclerophyll vegetation had also increased at the site in response to a shift to cooler, drier conditions; neither of these episodes had a significant impact on megafaunal abundance. Similar conclusions regarding the culpability of human hunters in the disappearance of Pleistocene megafauna were derived from high-resolution chronologies obtained via an analysis of a large collection of eggshell fragments of the flightless Australian bird \"Genyornis newtoni\", from analysis of \"Sporormiella\" fungal spores from a lake in eastern North America and from study of deposits of Shasta ground sloth dung left in over half a dozen caves in the American southwest.\n\nContinuing human hunting and environmental disturbance has led to additional megafaunal extinctions in the recent past, and has created a serious danger of further extinctions in the near future (see examples below).\n\nA number of other mass extinctions occurred earlier in Earth's geologic history, in which some or all of the megafauna of the time also died out. Famously, in the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event the non-avian dinosaurs and most other giant reptilians were eliminated. However, the earlier mass extinctions were more global and not so selective for megafauna; i.e., many species of other types, including plants, marine invertebrates and plankton, went extinct as well. Thus, the earlier events must have been caused by more generalized types of disturbances to the biosphere.\n\nMegafauna play a significant role in the lateral transport of mineral nutrients in an ecosystem, tending to translocate them from areas of high to those of lower abundance. They do so by their movement between the time they consume the nutrient and the time they release it through elimination (or, to a much lesser extent, through decomposition after death). In South America's Amazon Basin, it is estimated that such lateral diffusion was reduced over 98% following the megafaunal extinctions that occurred roughly 12,500 years ago. Given that phosphorus availability is thought to limit productivity in much of the region, the decrease in its transport from the western part of the basin and from floodplains (both of which derive their supply from the uplift of the Andes) to other areas is thought to have significantly impacted the region's ecology, and the effects may not yet have reached their limits.\n\nLarge populations of megaherbivores have the potential to contribute greatly to the atmospheric concentration of methane, which is an important greenhouse gas. Modern ruminant herbivores produce methane as a byproduct of foregut fermentation in digestion, and release it through belching or flatulence. Today, around 20% of annual methane emissions come from livestock methane release. In the Mesozoic, it has been estimated that sauropods could have emitted 520 million tons of methane to the atmosphere annually, contributing to the warmer climate of the time (up to 10 °C warmer than at present). This large emission follows from the enormous estimated biomass of sauropods, and because methane production of individual herbivores is believed to be almost proportional to their mass.\n\nRecent studies have indicated that the extinction of megafaunal herbivores may have caused a reduction in atmospheric methane. This hypothesis is relatively new. One study examined the methane emissions from the bison that occupied the Great Plains of North America before contact with European settlers. The study estimated that the removal of the bison caused a decrease of as much as 2.2 million tons per year. Another study examined the change in the methane concentration in the atmosphere at the end of the Pleistocene epoch after the extinction of megafauna in the Americas. After early humans migrated to the Americas about 13,000 BP, their hunting and other associated ecological impacts led to the extinction of many megafaunal species there. Calculations suggest that this extinction decreased methane production by about 9.6 million tons per year. This suggests that the absence of megafaunal methane emissions may have contributed to the abrupt climatic cooling at the onset of the Younger Dryas. The decrease in atmospheric methane that occurred at that time, as recorded in ice cores, was 2-4 times more rapid than any other decrease in the last half million years, suggesting that an unusual mechanism was at work.\n\nThe following are some notable examples of animals often considered as megafauna (in the sense of the \"large animal\" definition).

The term particularly refers to the annual Rathayatra in Odisha, Jharkhand, West Bengal and other East Indian states, particularly the Odia festival that involve a public procession with a chariot with deities Jagannath (Vishnu avatar), Balabhadra (his brother), Subhadra (his sister) and Sudarshana Chakra (his weapon) on a ratha, a wooden deula-shaped chariot. It attracts over a million Hindu pilgrims who join the procession each year.\n\n\"Rathayatra\" processions have been historically common in Vishnu-related (Jagannath, Rama, Krishna) traditions in Hinduism across India, in Shiva-related traditions, saints and goddesses in Nepal, with Tirthankaras in Jainism, as well as tribal folk religions found in the eastern states of India. Notable ratha yatras in India include the Ratha yatra of Puri, the Dhamrai Ratha Yatra and the Ratha Yatra of Mahesh. Hindu communities outside India, such as in Singapore, celebrate Rathayatra such as those associated with Jagannath, Krishna, Shiva and Mariamman. According to Knut Jacobsen, a \"Rathayatra\" has religious origins and meaning, but the events have a major community heritage, social sharing and cultural significance to the organizers and participants.\n\nRatha-yatra is derived two Sanskrit words, \"Ratha\" (रथ) which means chariot or carriage, and \"yātrā\" (यात्रा) which means journey or pilgrimage. In other Indian languages such as Odia, the phonetic equivalents are used, such as \"ratha\" and \"jatra\". Other names for the festival are \"ratha jatra\" or \"chariot festival\".\n\nRathayatra\" is a journey in a chariot accompanied by the public. It typically refers to a procession (journey) of deities, people dressed like deities, or simply religious saints and political leaders. The term appears in medieval texts of India such as the Puranas, which mention the Rathayatra of Surya (Sun god), of Devi (Mother goddess), and of Vishnu. These chariot journeys have elaborate celebrations where the individuals or the deities come out of a temple accompanied by the public journeying with them through the \"Ksetra\" (region, streets) to another temple or to the river or the sea. Sometimes the festivities include returning back to the sacrosanctum of the temple.\n\nTriads are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple at Puri, but once during the month of Asadha (Rainy Season of Odisha, usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (main street of Puri) and travel (3 km) to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots (ratha), allowing the public to have darśana (Holy view). This festival is known as Rath Yatra, meaning the journey (yatra) of the chariots (ratha). The Rathas are huge wheeled wooden structures, which are built anew every year and are pulled by the devotees. The chariot for Jagannath is approximately 45 feet high and 35 feet square and takes about 2 months to construct. The artists and painters of Puri decorate the cars and paint flower petals and other designs on the wheels, the wood-carved charioteer and horses, and the inverted lotuses on the wall behind the throne. The huge chariots of Jagannath pulled during Rath Yatra is the etymological origin of the English word Juggernaut. The Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra.\n\nThe most significant ritual associated with the Ratha-Yatra is the \"chhera pahara.\" During the festival, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots in the \"Chera Pahara\" (sweeping with water) ritual. The Gajapati King cleanses the road before the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder with utmost devotion. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannath. This ritual signified that under the lordship of Jagannath, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign Gajapati King and the most humble devotee.\n\n\"Chera pahara\" is held on two days, on the first day of the Ratha Yatra, when the deities are taken to garden house at Mausi Maa Temple and again on the last day of the festival, when the deities are ceremoniously brought back to the Shri Mandir.\n\nAs per another ritual, when the deities are taken out from the Shri Mandir to the Chariots in \"Pahandi vijay\".\n\nIn the Ratha Yatra, the three deities are taken from the Jagannath Temple in the chariots to the Gundicha Temple, where they stay for nine days. Thereafter, the deities again ride the chariots back to Shri Mandir in \"bahuda yatra\". On the way back, the three chariots halt at the Mausi Maa Temple and the deities are offered \"Poda Pitha,\" a kind of baked cake which are generally consumed by the people of Odisha.\nThe observance of the Rath Yatra of Jagannath dates back to the period of the Puranas. Vivid descriptions of this festival are found in Brahma Purana, Padma Purana, and Skanda Purana. Kapila Samhita also refers to Rath Yatra. In Moghul period also, King Ramsingh of Jaipur, Rajasthan has been described as organizing the Rath Yatra in the 18th Century. In Orissa, Kings of Mayurbhanj and Parlakhemundi were organizing the Rath Yatra, though the most grand festival in terms of scale and popularity takes place at Puri.\n\nMoreover, Starza notes that the ruling Ganga dynasty instituted the Rath Yatra at the completion of the great temple around 1150 AD. This festival was one of those Hindu festivals that was reported to the Western world very early. Friar Odoric of Pordenone visited India in 1316-1318, some 20 years after Marco Polo had dictated the account of his travels while in a Genoese prison. In his own account of 1321, Odoric reported how the people put the \"idols\" on chariots, and the King and Queen and all the people drew them from the \"church\" with song and music. \n\nThe Ratha Yatra festival has become a common sight in most major cities of the world since 1968 through the Hare Krishna movement. Local chapters put on the festival annually in over a hundred cities worldwide.\n\nDhamrai Jagannath Rath is a chariot temple, a Roth, dedicated to the Hindu God Jagannath located in Dhamrai, Bangladesh. The annual Jagannath Roth Jatra is a famous Hindu festival attracting thousands of people. The Roth Jatra in Dhamrai is one of the most important events for the Hindu community of Bangladesh. The original historical Roth was burnt down by the Pakistan Army in 1971 The Roth has since been rebuilt with Indian assistance.\n\nThe Ratha Yatra of Mahesh is the Second oldest chariot festival in India (after Rath Yatra at Puri) and oldest in Bengal, having been celebrated since 1396 A.D. It is a month-long festival held at Mahesh in Serampore of West Bengal and a grand fair is held at that time. People throng to have a share in pulling the long ropes (Roshi) attached to the chariots of Lord Jagannath, Balarama and Subhadra on the journey from the temple to Gundicha Bari (Masir bari) and back.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The oldest reference to the origin of scam letters could be found at the Spanish Prisoner scam. This scam dates back to the 1580s, where the fictitious prisoner would promise to share non-existent treasure with the person who would send him money to bribe the guards.\n\nToday scam letters are a general part of electronic life, ending up in mailboxes in hordes.\n\nBased on mostly the same principles as the Nigerian 419 advance-fee fraud scam, this scam letter informs recipients that their e-mail addresses have been drawn in online lotteries and that they have won large sums of money. Here the victims will also be required to pay substantial small amounts of money in order to have the winning money released, which never materializes.\n\nPhishing scam letters, in short, are a notification from an online 'financial institution', requiring its clients to log into their accounts and verify or change their log-in details. A fraudulent website is set up by offenders, which appears to be the website of the actual financial institution. Once a victim follows the log-in link from the scam letter and logs into the 'account', the log-in details are sent to the offenders.\n\nThis is yet another scam where the misrepresentation is made as an offer for cheap medical products and computer software. Often, when ordered, victims will not receive the goods or in certain instances a fake version of the goods ordered.\n\nOften users will find the letter from a young and attractive female wanting to meet or relocate to the users' country. After invoking their confidence trick on the user they will require the recipient of the scam letter to pay the funds necessary for the relocation. Once paid, the correspondence ends and the writer never appears.\n\nUsers of some Web sites are sometimes faced with invoices from Internet sites which they have visited. One company with a reputation for this is the Swiss-German based company Media Intense GmBH, which runs win-load.net. Users are asked to create an account before downloading a piece of software. The terms and conditions state that the account requires a subscription of 8 euros per month for a minimum of 24 months, but that the user forfeits the right to cancel. The user will then receive threatening invoices from the company.\n\nToday there exist many forms of scam letters distributed on the Internet. The mentioned examples above acs as an indication of how these scam letters work and how victims are defrauded.\n\nIn the past, before the introduction of electronic communications, scam letters were posted by normal postal services, which had been a slow and tedious method of defrauding victims. Although this method tremendously decreased its appearance today, it still occurs that a victim might receive the posted scam letter.\n\nFaxed scam letters are in no way an uncommon occurrence. Today many scam letters are still faxed to corporate institutions, although they are not a large amount due to cost restraints on behalf of offenders.\n\nE-mail is today the prevalent way in which scam letters are distributed. Due to its cost-effectiveness and international reach, offenders prefer this method as victims are reached in a much more timely manner.\n\nOften offenders will target busy Internet-based forums and chat rooms where they will circulate their scam letters to registered users.\n\nGenerally, law enforcement agencies from around the world are interested in scam letters where actual losses incurred upon a victim. Due to the sheer volume of scam letters distributed on the Internet, no law enforcement agency will be in a position to investigate every scam letter reported.\n\nMost law enforcement agencies, however, introduced a method of reporting scam letters to them. Information on reporting scam letter to them can be found at The Nigerian Scam Defined.\n\nDuring August 2007, a new private initiative, ScamLetters.com, was launched with the aim of assisting law enforcement agencies by relieving the burden of scam letter reports, as well as assisting in scam letter investigations by availing a unique database for reporting of scam letters by the public.\n\nEdna Fiedler, 44, of Olympia, Washington, on June 25, 2008, pleaded guilty in a Tacoma court and was sentenced to two years imprisonment and five years of supervised release or probation in an Internet $1 million \"Nigerian check scam\". She conspired to commit bank, wire and mail fraud against US citizens, specifically using Internet by having an accomplice ship counterfeit checks and money orders to her from Lagos, Nigeria in November 2007. Fiedler shipped out $609,000 fake check and money orders when arrested and prepared to send additional $1.1 million counterfeit materials. Also, the U.S. Postal Service intercepted $2.1 billion in counterfeit checks, lottery tickets and eBay overpayment schemes with a face value of $2.1 billion.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "73653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=73653", "title": "Six Degrees of Separation (play)", "text": "Six Degrees of Separation (play)\n\nSix Degrees of Separation is a play written by American playwright John Guare that premiered in 1990. The play was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Play.\n\nThe play explores the existential premise that everyone in the world is connected to everyone else in the world by a chain of no more than six acquaintances, thus, \"six degrees of separation\".\n\nA young black man named Paul shows up at the home of art dealer Flan Kittredge and his wife Louisa, known simply as \"Ouisa\", who live overlooking Central Park in New York City. Paul has a minor stab wound from an attempted mugging, and says he's a friend of their children at Harvard University. The Kittredges are trying to get the money to buy a painting by Paul Cézanne and now have this wounded stranger in their home. Paul claims he is in New York to meet his father, who is directing a film version of the Broadway musical \"Cats.\" Paul continues to charm them with his story, though, in reality, it is all a lie: Paul is not a Harvard student but obtained details on the Kittredges from another male student he had seduced. Eventually Paul uses their home for an encounter with a hustler, but is caught red-handed. The police are called, but Paul escapes.\n\nSoon after, Paul starts up another con against a sensitive young man named Rick and his live-in girlfriend, Elizabeth. The naive young couple are new to the big city having just moved to New York from Utah and, based on Paul's con, invite him to live with them until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father—who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him in order to get the money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that he has all their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick's father had always questioned his son's sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.\n\nIn desperation, Paul calls the Kittredges for assistance. Partly due to strained relations with her children, Ouisa finds herself feeling emotionally attached to Paul, hoping to be able to help him in some way despite the fact that he has victimized them. Over a protracted and laborious phone call, he agrees to give himself up to the police; however, during the arrest, he and the couple are separated. Despite their efforts—Ouisa's more than Flan's—his fate is unresolved, except for a possibly tragic end. Towards the end of the play, in a climactic moment of reflection, she delivers the play's most famous monologue:\n\nKristin Griffith and Swoosie Kurtz read the role of Ouisa Kittredge in workshops in 1989 before Stockard Channing was cast. Channing was originally unavailable and was committed to coming to Broadway in another play, Neil Simon's \"Jake's Women\". The play's Broadway run was canceled. Channing had starred previously in John Guare's \"The House of Blue Leaves\", and he offered her the role for the official Off-Broadway run. Kurtz later replaced Channing during the Broadway run.\n\nThe play premiered Off-Broadway at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, on May 16, 1990. Stockard Channing won an Obie Award for Best Actress for her performance. Guare won an Obie Award for his script.\n\nThe production transferred to the Vivian Beaumont Theater for its Broadway debut on November 8, 1990. The production closed on January 5, 1992 after 485 performances, directed by Jerry Zaks.Kelly Bishop played the role of Ouisa as a replacement on Broadway, and Laura Linney made her Broadway debut as a replacement for the role of Tess. The original Broadway production was nominated for four Tony Awards, winning for Best Direction for Zaks. A US. National tour was launched in 1992.Veronica Hamel also played Ouisa in the first production in Chicago.\n\nThe play made its UK debut in 1992 at the Royal Court Theatre and then transferred to the West End's Comedy Theatre. In 2010, the play was revived at the Old Vic theatre in London starring Lesley Manville as Ouisa.\n\nA 1995 production at Canadian Stage in Toronto, Ontario starred Fiona Reid as Ouisa, Jim Mezon as Flan and Nigel Shawn Williams as Paul. Both Williams and Reid won Dora Mavor Moore Awards for their performances, Williams as Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Principal Role – Play and Reid as Outstanding Performance by a Female in a Principal Role – Play.\n\nIn May 2004 Michael Buffong directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester with Lisa Eichhorn as Ouissa Kittredge, Phillip Bretherton as Flanders Kittredge and O-T Fagbenle as Paul. O-T Fabenle won a MEN Award for his performance.\n\nThe play was revived on Broadway at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in a limited engagement opening on April 5, 2017, starring Allison Janney, John Benjamin Hickey and Corey Hawkins, with direction by Trip Cullman.\n\nThe play was inspired by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who managed to convince a number of people in the 1980s that he was the son of actor Sidney Poitier. The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliott's New York apartment and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.\n\nAfter the play became a dramatic and financial success, Hampton was tried and acquitted for harassment of Guare; he felt he was due a share of the profits that he ultimately never received.\n\nA strong influence on the play is the novel \"The Catcher in the Rye\" by J. D. Salinger. There are some very overt references to it, as when the protagonist explains the thesis paper he has just written on \"The Catcher in The Rye\" to the family who takes him in for the night. There are also more subtle allusions made both in the script and in the cinematography of the film version, such as when various characters begin to take on Holden Caulfield-esque characteristics and attitudes.\n\nGuare adapted the play for a film released in 1993 directed by Fred Schepisi. Channing was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "262260", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262260", "title": "Steve Vai", "text": "Steve Vai\n\nSteven Siro Vai (; born June 6, 1960) is an American guitarist, composer, singer, songwriter, and producer. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of eighteen as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and joined his band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date. He has recorded and toured with Alcatrazz, David Lee Roth, Whitesnake, as well as having recorded with artists such as Mary J. Blige, Spinal Tap, and Ozzy Osbourne. Additionally, Vai has toured with live-only acts G3, Zappa Plays Zappa, the Experience Hendrix tour, as well as headlining international tours.\n\nVai has been described as a \"highly individualistic player\" and part of a generation of \"heavy rock and metal virtuosi who came to the fore in the 1980s\". He released his first solo album \"Flex-Able\" in 1984, while his most successful release, \"Passion and Warfare\" (1990), was described as \"the richest and best hard rock guitar-virtuoso album of the '80s\". He was voted the \"10th Greatest Guitarist\" by \"Guitar World\" magazine, and has sold over 15 million records.\n\nSteve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai. He described his first experiences with music as, \"at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint—the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want.\"<ref name=\"http://facebook.com/MakeWeirdMusic\"></ref>\n\nIt was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, \"I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen.\"\n\nAs a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his \"musical awakening\" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film \"West Side Story\". At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and progressive music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to Led Zeppelin's \"Heartbreaker\" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar.\n\nIn 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. Vai cites artists such as Jimmy Page, Brian May, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, as well as jazz fusion guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola as some of his major influences in that time period. \nIn 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa. Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse Pia Maiocco, with whom he has been together since; they have two children. In 2003, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee. \n\nIn 1978, Vai sent both a notated transcription of Frank Zappa's \"The Black Page\", and a recording of his college band, Morning Thunder, to Zappa. Impressed by this, Zappa responded by putting Vai on salary as a transcriptionist to transcribe his work, which included pieces from the \"Joe's Garage\" and \"Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar\" albums. After leaving Berklee College of Music and moving to California, Vai auditioned for and became a full-time member of Zappa's band, going on his first tour with Zappa in the fall of 1980. Zappa often referred to Vai as his \"little Italian virtuoso\", and Vai is frequently listed in the liner notes of Zappa's albums as having performed \"stunt\" or \"impossible\" guitar parts.\n\nVai was a featured artist on the 1993 release \"Zappa's Universe\", and in 2006, Vai appeared as a special guest on Dweezil Zappa's Zappa Plays Zappa tour; both projects won Vai a Grammy Award.\n\nAfter moving on from Zappa's employ in 1983, Vai bought a house in Sylmar, Los Angeles, where he built his first professional studio. During this period, Vai formed two bands (The Classified and 777) as well as writing and recording a large amount of music that was not originally intended for release. Out of this material, Vai compiled his first studio album \"Flex-Able\". He created his own record label, Akashic Records (later Light Without Heat Records), which he used to take \"Flex-Able\" directly to distribution channels. \"Flex-Able\" was released in January 1984.\n\nVai began his rise to public acclaim in 1983 when, shortly before the release of \"Flex-Able\", his composition \"The Attitude Song\" was published in \"Guitar Player\" magazine. The song centered itself on a main guitar riff in the time signature 7/16, played over a rhythm section centered in 4/4. Each following section of the song showcased a number of specialized techniques (such as two-handed tapping, whammy bar acrobatics, sweep picking, alternate picking, multi-part harmonies, and odd phrasing) used in angular and exaggerated ways that were unique to the song at the time. Interest from the public eye grew more so when Vai's song \"Blue Powder\" (a demonstration for the Carvin X100b amplifier) was published in \"Guitar Player\" as well, which showed the virtuoso side of Vai's compositional process. Also in 1986, Vai was cast in the blockbuster film \"Crossroads\" as the Devil's guitar player \"Jack Butler\". In the famous \"duel scene\" between Vai and Ralph Macchio's characters, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar, which was performed by Ry Cooder.\n\nIn between solo work, Vai replaced Yngwie Malmsteen in June 1984 as the lead guitarist of Alcatrazz, with whom he recorded the album \"Disturbing the Peace\". Vai left shortly after the subsequent tour to join David Lee Roth's band.\n\nIn 1985, Vai joined David Lee Roth's post-Van Halen band as lead guitarist, together with former Talas Bassist Billy Sheehan on bass; and former Maynard Ferguson drummer Gregg Bissonette on drums. The foursome's debut album \"Eat 'Em and Smile\", released on July 7, 1986, was both a critical and commercial success, reaching number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 albums chart and selling over two million copies. \"Guitar World\" magazine editor Brad Tolinski commented on Vai's playing at the time, saying that \"Steve Vai's guitar wizardry is so profound that in earlier times he would have been burned as a witch.\" Retrospectively, \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" is frequently evaluated as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1980s. The group's Eat 'Em and Smile Tour began in August 1986 and continued through February 1987.\n\nRoth's subsequent album \"Skyscraper\", released in 1988, was produced by both Roth and Vai. Like its predecessor, the album was a commercial success, reaching number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. In 1989, following the successful Skyscraper Tour, Vai departed from the band. He was replaced by Cacophony guitarist Jason Becker.\n\nIn 1985, after having joined Roth's band, Vai designed the JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry. Vai began working with Ibanez in 1986 to develop the guitar, and the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were released in 1987.\n\nFrom 1985 to 1990, Vai recorded \"Passion and Warfare\" at his home studio, his second studio solo album. After leaving Roth's band in 1989, Vai bought out of his Capitol Records contract and signed on with Relativity Records for the release of \"Passion and Warfare\", which was completed shortly after he began recording the guitar parts for Whitesnake's \"Slip of the Tongue\" album, where he replaced the injured Adrian Vandenberg.\n\nUpon its release in November 1989, \"Slip of the Tongue\" sold over three million copies worldwide, reaching number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 while Vai joined the band on their thirteen-month world tour.\n\nIn September 1990, Vai released \"Passion and Warfare\" through Relativity Records, and within the first week of release, the album had reached number 18 in the \"Billboard\" 200, selling over a million and a half copies worldwide. \"Passion and Warfare\" won Vai a number of awards such as \"Guitar World\" and \"Guitar Player\"'s \"Best Album\" and \"Best Rock Guitarist\" awards. \"Passion and Warfare\" has been cited as one of the most pertinent instrumental albums released.\n\n1990 also saw the release of the Ibanez Universe seven-string guitar co-designed by Vai in conjunction with Ibanez. Vai left Whitesnake in 1990 to pursue his own musical avenues, and formed a band that included Devin Townsend on vocals, T. M. Stevens on bass, and Terry Bozzio on drums. The group released \"Sex & Religion\" on July 23, 1993, that was described as visceral in nature, combining a compositional and progressive metal rhythm section with Devin Townsend's vocal arrangements. After the following tour in support of the album, the group disbanded. Vai began working with Ozzy Osbourne in 1994, with whom he wrote and recorded the \"Ozzmosis\" album. Due to label conflicts, the album was re-written and recorded with Zakk Wylde on guitar. In 1994, Vai won a Grammy award for his performance of \"Sofa\", from \"Zappa's Universe\".\n\nWhile recording his fourth studio album \"Fire Garden\", Vai took time to record and release the stripped down EP \"Alien Love Secrets\". A departure from the often highly compositional and heavily produced style of his previous projects, the seven-track EP was recorded in four weeks and released through Relativity/Epic Records on March 21, 1995. Vai cites this record as one of his favorites, saying \"The recording and release of \"Alien Love Secrets\" marked another turning point in my personal evolution. I was more concerned with making the record that I wanted to make, and not worry about what some others thought I should be doing.\"\n\nOn September 17, 1996, Vai released \"Fire Garden\", 19-track double album, through Epic, with the first half being primarily instrumental while the second half featured Vai on vocals. After the release of \"Fire Garden\", Vai joined his former teacher Joe Satriani, along with guitarist Eric Johnson, for the second installment of the ongoing G3 concert tours. On each G3 tour, three guitar-centric headlining acts are chosen to perform their own sets, and then collectively jam to fan favorite songs at the end of the show. \"\", a video of the 1996 tour was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and released on June 3, 1997.\n\nIn 1998, Vai independently released a performance footage DVD of \"Alien Love Secrets\". Also in 1998, Vai started the Make a Noise Foundation with his then-manager Ruta Sepetys. The goal of the foundation was to provide funding for musical education to those otherwise unable to attain it. Today, Vai often auctions items in his possession with proceeds going to the foundation.\n\nIn December 2001, Vai recorded two performances at The Astoria in London, with his band The Breed (composed of former David Lee Roth bandmate Billy Sheehan, guitarist/pianist Tony MacAlpine, guitarist Dave Weiner, and drummer Virgil Donati). This live show was released independently in DVD format as \"Steve Vai: Live at the Astoria, London\" in 2003, and was Vai's first of many successful live concert DVD projects. In 2004, Vai released twelve tracks from the DVD in an online only release.\n\n2001 saw the limited release of \"The Secret Jewel Box\", a conceptual ten-CD box set containing unique material from various eras of Vai's career. Four compilation albums (\"The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1\"; \"Mystery Tracks – Archives Vol. 3\"; \"Various Artists – Archives Vol. 4\"; and \"\") included as part of the box set, were released to the public both in 2001 and the years following. Also in 2001, Vai's record label Favored Nations released \"\". The release, which Vai himself produced and engineered, won him his second Grammy award for Best Pop Instrumental Album in February 2002.\n\nWhile most widely recognized for his stature as a rock guitar player, Vai is also a musical composer fluent in the composition and arranging of orchestral music. In May 2004, Vai premiered \"The Aching Hunger\", a project commissioned by the Netherlands Programme Service and performed with the Netherlands' Metropole Orchestra. \"The Aching Hunger\" performances consisted of two parts: the first showcasing Vai's original contemporary orchestral compositions, and the second consisting of Vai (on guitar) playing newly arranged material from his catalog with the orchestra. This project yielded both the \"Visual Sound Theories\" DVD and the \"Sound Theories Vol. I & II\" album, which were recorded in 2005 during multiple \"Aching Hunger\" performances and released in June 2007. While \"The Aching Hunger\" and its following releases started Vai's public career as an orchestral composer, Vai had been composing since he began a music theory class (taught by Bill Westcott) in high school. In speaking of Westcott, Vai says \"He taught me how to write, compose and appreciate music. There was no greater musical influence in my life.\"\n\nIn 2005, Vai released \"\", the first installment in an ongoing three-part trilogy concept album. Each of the three installments to the series contain material (songs, lyrics, and both spoken and written narration) with particular relationships to the storyline, purposefully left out of order. Upon the release of the third installment, Vai intends to complete a fourth album of material, which will then be released with the previous three installments and completed storyline in order. In speaking of the storyline, Vai says \"It's a human interest story, about the human condition. ... It's a story about this man who has a traumatic experience in his life, and it drives him insane. We see the story through his eyes. It also involves the town he lives in and this stranger that enters the town who's like a shaman; he builds this giant edifice, like a reflecting pond, and when people come to it they see aspects of their personalities and identities and discover things about themselves. There's some comedy involved, too, but it's pretty esoteric. It's about a lot of lofty principles, so it's not a bad idea to dish this all out slowly.\" The installments to the series will be released over periods of time, with the second, \"The Story of Light\", having been released in 2012.\n\nIn 2006, Vai joined the Zappa Plays Zappa tour as a special guest, alongside additional Zappa band alumni Terry Bozzio and Napoleon Murphy Brock. In 2008, for his performance of \"Peaches en Regalia\" from the Zappa Plays Zappa tour, Vai won his third Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Having always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of \"Alien Guitar Secrets\" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play (see Notable contributions for more on this).\n\nIn support of \"Sound Theories Vol. I & II\" and \"Visual Sound Theories\", Vai put together a new band for a five-month world tour of the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia. While evaluating unique options for the band (which included ideas for a horn section or percussion section), Vai began auditioning violin players to complement the new lineup. This new band, known as the String Theories band, featured previous The Breed members Jeremy Colson (drums) and Dave Weiner (guitar and sitar), along with new members Bryan Beller (bass), Alex DePue (violin), and Ann Marie Calhoun (violin). During a month of twelve- to fifteen-hour a day rehearsals, Vai and the band perfected the performance (which consisted of pieces from Vai's catalog, arranged by Vai to include the two violins). The tour began in June 2007 and ended in December the same year.\n\nMidway through the String Theories tour in 2007, Vai recorded a performance at the State Theatre in Minneapolis, which yielded the acclaimed 2009 live concert DVD and Blu-ray release of \"Where the Wild Things Are\". Certified gold in the United States and Canada, \"Where the Wild Things Are\" showcased the diverse musical range of the String Theories band, with pieces such as the visceral Grammy-nominated \"Now We Run\", to the dynamic ballad \"Angel Food\".\n\n2007 also marked the 20th anniversary of the production of the Ibanez JEM guitar, a milestone which was commemorated with the 20th anniversary JEM model. Made of an acrylic body with three-dimensional \"swirl painted\" interior, this guitar can be seen in the beginning of the \"Where the Wild Things Are\" DVD. In 2008, Vai announced the release of his signature Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a twin distortion pedal with both a custom overdrive and lead distortion section.\n\n2010 marked the twentieth anniversary of the production of the Ibanez Universe guitar, which was commemorated with a twentieth anniversary Universe model. A reissue of the early 1990s Universe 77 MC (multi-color swirl), the model included a new five-piece maple/bubinga Universe neck and original swirl-paint job by Darren Johansen (the painter of the original Universe 77 MC guitars).\n\nIn February 2010, Vai announced the introduction of \"VaiTunes\", a platform used to release digital-only singles via iTunes and other digital media outlets. In April, Vai performed with Mary J. Blige, Orianthi, Randy Jackson, and Travis Barker for a rendition of the Led Zeppelin classic \"Stairway to Heaven\", on the hit television show \"American Idol\".\n\nOctober 2010 saw more movement from Vai as a composer, with the premiere of two original symphonies at the Steve Vai Festival in Groningen, the Netherlands, and performed by the North Netherlands Orchestra. Shortly after the festival, Vai embarked on the Experience Hendrix tour (along with Eric Johnson, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Susan Tedeschi, Billy Cox, Vernon Reid, Robert Randolph, Jonny Lang, Brad Whitford, and others) for a nationwide tour of the United States.\n\nIn March 2011, Vai (in conjunction with the online education division of Berklee College of Music) set a Guinness World Record for the world's largest online guitar lesson. The lesson was held as a promotion for Berklee's online \"Steve Vai Guitar Techniques\" course, which Vai helped to construct. In April 2011, Vai (along with music and technology entrepreneur Andy Alt) announced the launch of GuitarTV, an online streaming website dedicated to bringing free guitar-related content to the community of guitar players around the world.\n\nVai's eighth studio album, \"The Story of Light\", was released in August 2012 as the second installment in the \"Real Illusions\" concept album trilogy. \"The Story of Light\" tour, which began on the month of the album's release, spanned 254 engagements in 52 different countries, ending in September 2014. This tour yielded the 2015 release of Vai's fourth live DVD project \"Stillness in Motion\", filmed in October 2012 during his \"Story of Light\" tour at the Club Nokia in Los Angeles. Released on April 7, the double-disc set contained a copy of the \"Stillness in Motion\" concert footage and a special bonus feature disc called \"The Space Between the Notes\". The latter is a complete chronological timeline of the \"Story of Light\" tour, with a video or picture representation of each show of all of the 254 engagements attended.\n\n2014 saw the announcement of a new, intensive guitar camp called the \"Vai Academy\", which was an evolution of the Alien Guitar Secrets masterclass. Each year the camp is held, Vai creates a syllabus with a particular theme and invites special guests to help him teach it. During the day, Vai and the special guests (of whom have included Guthrie Govan, Jeff Baxter, Vernon Reid, Eric Johnson, Sonny Landreth, and others) hold classes in which they add their insight and perspective to the theme. Each evening, Vai and the special guests jam with the campers. The themes have included 2014's Vai Academy- Song Evolution Camp, and 2015's Vai Academy: All About the Guitar.\n\nVai has announced an upcoming 2016 release commemorating the 25th anniversary of \"Passion and Warfare\". This release will contain remastered songs from the album, as well as the inclusion of a new album of material written from the time between the recording of \"Passion and Warfare\" and his first solo album \"Flex-Able\". After the release, Vai will hold a world tour in which he will play the entire \"Passion and Warfare\" album, along with material from the new release. The tour would continue during the first half of 2017.\n\nIn 2016, Vai played an uncredited guitar solo on the track \"Go!,\" from the album \"Junk\" by French electronic band M83. In April an May of the same year, Vai took part in the Generation Axe tour, alongside Tosin Abasi, Nuno Bettencourt, Yngwie Malmsteen, and Zakk Wylde. Starting in June, Vai embarked on the \"Passion and Warfare\" 25th Anniversary World Tour, where he played the album in its entirety for the first time.\n\n\"Juice\", from \"Alien Love Secrets\", was featured on the 1996 video game \"Formula One\" for the PlayStation. Vai's guitar work also appeared in the 2002 video game \"\". David Lee Roth's \"Yankee Rose\" was featured on \"Vice City\"'s soundtrack, as well as \"God Blessed Video\" by Alcatrazz, as part of the Lazlow-led, 1980s rock/metal radio station \"V-Rock.\" In 2004, Vai was featured on the soundtrack to the Xbox video game \"Halo 2\", performing a heavy rock guitar rendition of the \"Halo theme\", known as \"Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)\". He also performed on the track \"Never Surrender\". He later featured in the second volume of the soundtrack, where he performed on the track \"Reclaimer\". Vai returned to re-record his \"Halo\" work for the \"\", which was released in 2014 and included as part of the anniversary edition of \"Halo 2\".\n\nIn 2008, Vai's song \"For the Love of God\" and \"Halo Theme (MJOLNIR Mix)\" were featured as downloadable tracks for the game \"Guitar Hero 3\". A live version of \"For the Love of God\" was also available on the Rock Band Network service, as well as the song \"Get the Hell Out of Here\" from his 2002 compilation album \"The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1\" on March 4, 2010. \"The Attitude Song\" and a live version of \"The Crying Machine\" were both also added to the Rock Band Network. A re-recording of \"Speeding\" is featured in the 2010 video game \"\" for Xbox 360, Wii and PlayStation 3.\n\nIn 1986, Vai was cast in the blockbuster film \"Crossroads\" as the Devil's guitar player \"Jack Butler.\" In the \"cutting heads\" scene between Vai's Jack Butler and Ralph Macchio's Eugene \"Lightning\" Martone, Vai wrote and performed all guitar parts with the exception of the slide guitar (which was performed by Ry Cooder). The main body of the final piece performed in the duel scene (the fast-paced neoclassical track \"Eugene's Trick Bag\") was based heavily on Niccolò Paganini's Capriccio number 5. The \"Crossroads\" duel appeared on the 2002 album \"The Elusive Light and Sound, Vol. 1\".\n\nIn 1987, Vai performed \"Amazing Grace\" in the film \"Dudes\". In 1991, Vai performed on the film \"Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey\", as well as on 1992's \"Encino Man,\" \"PCU\" (1994), and John Carpenter's \"Ghosts of Mars\" (where he played on the tracks \"Ghosts of Mars\" and \"Ghost Poppin'\").\n\nIn 2010, Vai's record label Favored Nations produced and released the award-winning original motion picture \"Crazy\". An independent film, \"Crazy\" was inspired by the life and music of the guitarist Hank Garland.\n\nAt the age of thirteen, after having purchased his first guitar and begun taking his first lessons with fellow New York native Joe Satriani, Vai became obsessed with the discipline of practice. Vai's practice routine, consisting of a rigid and structured regiment of ten-to-fifteen hour-a-day practice schedules, became the basis of his work ethic for the rest of his career. During his employment by Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed and played very rhythmically complex music, believing that if started slow and perfected, any piece of music could be played.\n\nVai's first solo album, \"Flex-able\", began his career as a solo artist in 1984. During the period of time that the album was recorded, Vai was heavily influenced by his previous tenure in Frank Zappa's band. Originally not intended for release, \"Flex-able\" expressed a certain creative \"quirky\" and \"angular\" freedom in the eclectic nature of Vai's writing style. \"Passion and Warfare\", Vai's second solo album, expressed a more mature and evolved \"signature\" style but retained a certain freedom of unfettered inspiration that would continue to influence Vai's future releases. In speaking of his inspiration, Vai has said that it comes to him in many forms (even from the flowers pushed up against a fence outside of his studio, which he transcribed and used in the ninth track \"Weeping China Doll\", from \"The Story of Light\"). While expressing that he is not continuously inspired, Vai uses a concept he calls \"musical meditation\" to enter a state of consciousness that he calls \"The Ultra Zone\". When inside this un-critical frame of mind, Vai is able to achieve inspiration in the form of musical ideas (often in forms of melody or rhythm). For these moments of inspiration, Vai created what he calls the \"Infinity Shelf\", a drive of thousands of snippets of song ideas that he has collected over his entire career. These esoteric principles are taught by Vai during his Alien Guitar Secrets masterclasses, among a host of other information.\n\nVai's playing style utilizes specialized guitar techniques (such as two-handed tapping, alternate picking, legato, hybrid picking, sweep picking, whammy bar acrobatics, and circular vibrato) in his music, as well as a wide range of recording techniques.\n\nAs a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, Vai transcribed some of Zappa's most rhythmically complex music, using a range of conceptualizations for the notation of rhythmic music. Vai says \"While transcribing the material, I was often confronted with situations that led me to reach into the intuitional areas of my imagination to come up with various notational devices and constructions that I had never seen before. I soon discovered that many contemporary composers were then (and are still) using these notations\". These concepts can be seen throughout the \"Frank Zappa Guitar Book\", which were composed of Vai's guitar and drum transcriptions from various Zappa albums. Vai toured with Zappa from 1980 to 1983, performing selections of this technically demanding music with Zappa's band at the time.\n\nVai designed the Ibanez JEM guitar, a unique instrument that incorporated a series of groundbreaking designs that have since become staples in feature throughout the guitar industry, in 1985. In speaking of the development of the guitar, Vai says, \"Stratocasters had whammy bars—which were fantastic—but they were very limited, were always going out of tune, and had single-coil pickups. Les Pauls had humbuckers—which gave you that real scream in the bridge position—but no whammy bar, and I didn't like the way they sat. Neither guitar had twenty-four frets. So I went to a guitar shop in Hollywood, where I had these elements implemented into a guitar (what would have been considered a Superstrat at the time). The guitar was designed with a sharper body shape, a large cutaway around the neck, twenty-four frets, a fully floating tremolo system, a specially wired five-way pickup selector switch, and an output jack angled on the side of the body (so that when you step on the cable, it doesn't pull out of your guitar). I knew of course that these features would eventually be taken and used in other guitars, so I did something completely preposterous: I said, 'Put a handle in it!' That way, during videos and photoshoots I could swing the guitar around.\"\n\nVai had several custom prototypes of these guitars built (which were used on the \"Eat 'Em and Smile\" tour) by Joe \"Jem\" Despagni, a custom guitar luthier and friend of Vai's. Due to Vai's highly coveted position in Roth's band, many guitar companies were eager to propose endorsement opportunities. In response to these offers, Vai sent out the specifications of the JEM guitar, detailing that the company that returned the best guitar would be given the endorsement. Dissatisfied with the guitars returned and unwilling to compromise, Vai held out on a guitar endorsement until Ibanez approached him, sending him an instrument superior to that of the other companies and willing to follow his instructions. After the pre-production prototypes were perfected, the first production Ibanez JEM 777 guitars were unveiled at the NAMM Show in 1987. Since its original 1987 release, the JEM has become one of the longest-running and most successful signature series guitars in history, with its sister guitar, the Ibanez RG, being the second highest-selling guitar (behind the Fender Stratocaster) on the market.\n\nAnother design by Vai was the Ibanez Universe, the first production seven-string guitar, which was released in 1989. The Universe incorporated many of the aspects that made the JEM a unique instrument (24 frets, full floating tremolo, special pickup configuration, angled output jack, and deeper body cutaway), with an added low 'B' string, allowing for new low-range sonic possibilities. Used by Vai on much of \"Passion and Warfare\" and all of Whitesnake's \"Slip of the Tongue\", the Universe was a large stepping stone for the burgeoning Nu-metal genre (with bands such as Korn having adopted the instrument and incorporating it into their signature sound).\n\nHaving always enjoyed the aspect of teaching and sharing his experiences in life and in the music business, Vai began a series of \"Alien Guitar Secrets\" masterclasses in 2006- a touring masterclass in which Vai holds open forum discussion about his own experiences in the music industry, explains the key principles to understanding success, plays to backing tracks (often inviting class attendees to jam with him), answers questions, articulates key points of guitar technique, and more importantly goes beyond the technique and into the more profound esoteric principles at play. Vai details certain concepts he has discovered that have helped him in all areas of his life and career, both in playing guitar/ musically as well as spiritually. Vai accessibly shares these concepts with masterclass participants using examples from his own experiences, delving into the ongoing process of identifying the self-critical nature of one’s own thoughts. Vai explains the techniques and exercises he uses to circumnavigate one’s own insecurities and thoughts of self-doubt, and encourages masterclass participants to use these tools in their own lives. Often embarking on masterclass tours through Europe, South America, and Russia, Vai considers this ongoing series of classes as one of his most important contributions.\n\nGuitar effects manufacturer Eventide approached Vai in the mid-1980s to contribute unique ideas for their H3000 effects unit. Vai suggested many specific concepts, such as diatonic pitch change and multi-voice harmony, that were used in the unit and have since become standard algorithms in guitar effects processors.\n\nIn 1993, Vai's signature series high-output \"Evolution\" humbucker pickup set was released by DiMarzio. The Evolution pickups use DiMarzio's patented \"Dual-Resonance\" design. The \"EVO 2\" humbucker, a lower output model, was released in 2004.\n\nIn 1997, Vai had begun working with the Carvin Corporation to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 Epic Records release \"The Ultra Zone\". The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III being released in 2012.\n\nIn the 1990s, Vai began touring in European and Asian countries (such as Russia and China) as well as South America, often having been the first American rock act in history to have performed in these areas. In 2014, Vai performed on the Chinese television station BTV's \"Spring Festival Global Gala,\" a program broadcast to over two billion viewers. With the broadcasting of this event on January 26, 2014, Vai became the first rock artist ever broadcast on a Chinese television program.\n\nVai's personal studio, \"The Harmony Hut\", is a large edifice located in his backyard equipped with a full control room and performance room. The studio, built in 2011, is where Vai currently produces, records, and mixes his new material.\nVai has two main signature series Ibanez JEM six-string guitars (dubbed \"EVO\" and \"FLO III\") that he uses for a majority of his live and studio work. \"EVO\", a prototype Ibanez JEM 7VWH, was received in 1993 while developing Vai's signature DiMarzio Evolution pickups (hence the name of the guitar), and \"FLO III\" is a basswood Ibanez Los Angeles Custom Shop JEM 7VWH equipped with a Fernandes Sustainer system and a DiMarzio PAF Pro pickup in bridge position.\n\nHis other favourite guitars include \"BO\", a JEM77BRMR prototype, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer system and blue LED dot inlays, which was stolen in 2015, but recovered after; the original \"FLO\" guitar, a transformed original 77FP JEM to 7VWH specifications, also equipped with Fernandes Sustainer System and EVO 2 bridge pickup; and \"Bruno\" aka \"For the Love of God\" Ibanez Universe UV77MC seven-string guitar with burnt finish and mirror pickguard (this guitar was used in the \"For the Love of God\" music video). Vai uses his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier, as well as Morley Pedals, with whom he has his signature Bad Horsie and Bad Horsie II wah pedals, and Little Alligator volume pedal. Vai uses the Ibanez Jemini distortion pedal, a signature twin distortion pedal with separate overdrive and distortion sections.\n\nBefore his endorsement with Ibanez, Vai was endorsed by Charvel guitars, most notably using a green and black San Dimas model. In addition, over the course of his career, Vai has used guitars made by various other companies, including Jackson, Fender, and Gavtone. \n\nVai's 2016 live guitar rig utilizes his signature Carvin Legacy amplifier (now on its third version), the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL, and an MFC-101 foot controller.\n\nDepending on the location and venue, Vai will use either his Legacy I or Legacy III heads, and Carvin Legacy 4x12 speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses EL-34 tubes by Groove Tubes in his Legacy amps.\n\nVai uses the Fractal Audio Axe-Fx II XL as the only modulation effects unit in his guitar rig. Generally for live use he utilizes the unit for stereo effects such as delay, chorus, and phase, with a separate preset for the parameters of each different song in his setlist. The Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller is set up in conjunction with the unit, allowing Vai to switch effects on and off in a fashion reminiscent to that of standard stompboxes.\n\nVai's pedalboard consists of a wah-wah pedal (either his Morley Bad Horsie signature pedal, or a Dunlop Cry Baby 95q), an Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and DigiTech Whammy DT pitch shifting pedal. The centerpiece of the pedalboard is the Axe-Fx MFC-101 foot controller for the Axe-Fx II XL, which, as previously mentioned, controls the effects in a manner similar to switching on and off stompboxes. There are two expression pedals used for the Axe-Fx, one to act as a volume pedal, and the other to control the harmonizer built into the Axe-Fx unit.\n\nThe signal from the guitar (usually one of the main guitars \"EVO\" or \"FLO III\") goes into either the Morley Bad Horsie or Dunlop 95q wah pedal. From there, it goes directly into the Ibanez Jemini twin distortion pedal, and then to the Digitech Whammy DT. From the output of the Whammy, the signal heads into the input of the Carvin Legacy amplifier head. Out of the effects loop of the Legacy, the signal heads directly into the Axe-Fx II XL, where it is split into stereo and the effects are applied (and controlled via the MFC-101 foot controller). Out of the output of the Axe-Fx, one signal is sent back to the original Legacy head return, and a second is sent to a second Carvin Legacy head return, bypassing the preamp stage completely and acting as a slave power amp. Vai utilizes his stereo setup on effects like delay, where he sets up two separate delay times (one slower and one faster) and allows them to alternate back and forth. The signal is then sent from the amp to the 4x12 Carvin Legacy speaker cabinets loaded with Celestion Vintage 30 speakers. Vai uses AKG microphones to mic his amps, and uses a separate Carvin power amp to power a direct guitar monitor cabinet instead of relying on the PA.\n\nIn 1997, Vai began working with the Carvin Corporation to design a signature series of Legacy amplifiers, which were used on his 1999 album \"The Ultra Zone\". The original Legacy I model was released in 1999, with the most recent Legacy III model being released in 2012.\n\nDetailed gear diagrams of both Vai's 1999 and 2007 guitar rigs are well-documented.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Vai has resided in Encino, Los Angeles with his family. Vai is married to Pia Maiocco, former bassist of the band Vixen (who can be seen in the 1984 film \"Hardbodies\"), with whom he has two children, Julian and Fire Vai. Vai is also a vegetarian and a beekeeper, regularly tending to the beehives kept on his Encino property.\n\nAn avid reader of spiritual and religious literature, Vai is also a practitioner of meditation, at times in his life meditating up to two-and-a-half hours per day. Inspired by the teachings of Abraham Hicks, Jiddu Krishnamurti, Marianne Williamson's \"A Course in Miracles\", the teachings of Christ, Siddhartha Gautama, and Madame Blavatsky, Vai cites the teachings of Eckhart Tolle as \"the most powerful pointers that have ever been written regarding the one true spiritual dimension of consciousness and infinite potentiality that is within us all\".\n\nNot including guest appearances.\n\nEarly bands\n\nBerklee bands\n\nProfessional bands\n\nSolo band (1992–94)\n\n\"Sex & Religion\" album\n\n\"Sex & Religion\" tour\n\n1995\n1996–99\n\n2000\n\n2001–02 – \"The Breed\"\n\n2003–05 – \"The Breed\"\n\n2007 – \"String Theories\"\n\n2012 – \"The Story of Light Band\"\n\n2013 – \"The Story of Light Band, Australia, New Zealand and Asian Leg\" \n\n2015 – \"Stillness in Motion: Live DVD Band\" \n\nVai started his recording career in 1980 with Frank Zappa, and has since recorded with a plethora of artists and bands. In 1983, Vai began his career as a solo artist with his release of \"Flex-Able\", and solidified his place as a virtuoso rock guitarist with his acclaimed 1990 release of \"Passion and Warfare\". His discography consists of eight studio albums, two EPs, two special albums, eight live albums, twelve soundtracks, twenty compilation albums, and six DVD releases.\n\nStudio albums:\n\nThese are the three wins from Vai's 15 solo or collaborative nominations:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38656856", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38656856", "title": "Sudden unexplained death in childhood", "text": "Sudden unexplained death in childhood\n\nSudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is the death of a child over the age of 12 months which remains unexplained after a thorough investigation and autopsy. There has not been enough research to identify risk factors, common characteristics, or prevention strategies for SUDC.\n\nSUDC is similar in concept to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Like SIDS, SUDC is a diagnosis of exclusion, the concrete symptom of both being death. However, SIDS is a diagnosis specifically for infants under the age of 12 months while SUDC is a diagnosis for children 12 months and older. As the causes of both are still unknown, it is not yet possible to determine whether or not they are caused by the same factors.\n\nResearchers are exploring a possible connection between sudden unexplained death in toddlers, febrile seizures, and hippocampal anomalies.\n\nSUDC is rare, with a reported incidence in the United States of 1.2 deaths per 100,000 children, compared to 54 deaths per 100,000 live births for SIDS.\n\nSUDC deaths have occurred at the following sites:\n\n\nThe placed and found positions were as follows:\n\n\nAt the SIDS Alliance national convention in Atlanta, GA in 1999 Dr. Henry Krous gave a presentation titled \"Post-Infancy SIDS: Is it on the rise?\" This led to the beginning of the San Diego SUDC Research Project.

The concert, held over three nights (May 20 - May 22) and partly backed by UNESCO, took place in front of the world's largest wooden building, housing the largest Buddha statue in the world.\n\nUNESCO hoped that the event would be the first of seven annual concerts that would take place at some of the world's architectural treasures - the sites it had in mind included the Pyramids, China's Forbidden City and the Taj Mahal - but nothing came of the idea. A concert earmarked for a Mexican pyramid was called off because of the collapse of the peso.\n\nThe Tōdai-ji concert brought together Japanese and Western musicians playing music showing the influences of both cultures. The musicians included Bob Dylan, Jon Bon Jovi, Joni Mitchell and INXS. Dylan played in front of the Tokyo New Philharmonic orchestra, the first time he had played with an orchestra.\n\nThe priests of Tōdai-ji agreed to stage the concert only after talks lasting several months with British producer Tony Hollingsworth. Shinkai Shindō, the head priest, said that Buddhism aimed to make people happy and that the concert would make the religion more appealing to young people. UNESCO said that it would not have gone ahead if it was not convinced that the site would be respected in a physical, cultural and religious sense.\n\nUNESCO hoped that a series of concerts would be able to use the appeal of rock musicians to widen the audience for the world's cultural heritage. The Tōdai-ji concert would also help to promote traditional Japanese music. It was important for traditional musicians to stand on the same stage with Dylan and Bon Jovi.\n\nHollingsworth said that his aim was to create a \"roller coaster of musical cultures\", with Japanese and Western artists playing together after a week of rehearsals. The final night's concert on May 22 was broadcast to 50 countries but, with a breakdown of equipment, a tape recording of the second night was interwoven with the live concert for some of the time. Two documentaries were also broadcast, showing western artists watching Japanese cultural events and rehearsing with Japanese musicians.\n\nThe star of the show turned out to be Dylan who said as soon as he came off-stage that he had not sung so well for 15 years. Dylan opened with \"A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall\" which \"Q\" magazine said was \"no ordinary version...[he] really opens his lungs and heart and sings, like he's not done for many a year...The only word for it majestic.\"\n\nHollingsworth's original idea for the concert was to help overcome western hostility towards Japan caused by the highly successful Japanese economy.

In 1969, he was posted to command the IV Corps while acting as martial law administrator in West Pakistan under President Yahya Khan. In 1971, he took over the command of unified Eastern Command in East Pakistan and appointed as Governor of East Pakistan where he oversaw the planning and the military deployments to execute the military operations to quell the liberation war efforts by Awami League. His tough rhetoric to deal with political enemies earned him the notoriety and a nickname of \"Touka\", and was soon relieved of his command by President Yahya Khan.\n\nAfter commanding the II Corps in the war with India in 1971, Tikka Khan was promoted to four-star rank and appointed as the first chief of army staff of the Pakistan Army in 1972. As an army chief, he provided his support to the clandestine nuclear weapons programme alongside with Ghulam Ishaq Khan— a bureaucrat. Upon retirement from the military in 1976, he was subsequently appointed as National Security Advisor by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, only to removed in 1977 as a result of enforced martial law. In the 1980s, he remained active as a political worker of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and emerged as its leader when appointed as Governor of Punjab after the general elections held in 1988. After Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was dismissed by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990, his tenure was terminated and was succeeded by Mian Muhammad Azhar. He retired from the politics in 1990. He died on 28 March 2002 and was buried with full military honours in Westridge cemetery in Rawalpindi, Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nTikka Khan was born on 10 February 1915 into a Rajput Punjabi family in Jochha Mamdot village of Kahuta Tehsil, near Rawalpindi, Punjab, British Indian Empire. Tikka Khan never received any university education nor he joined the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun. After educating in Rawalpindi, he joined the Army Cadet College in Nowgong, Madhya Pradesh in 1933 and joined the British Indian Army as a NCO in 1935; he gained commissioned in the army on 22 December 1940.\n\nHe participated in World War II and fought with the 2nd Field Regiment, Regiment of Artillery in Libya against the Afrika Korps led by German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in 1940. He was captured by the German troops and held as POW in Libya for more than year. After making his successful escape, he saw military action in Burma front against Japan in 1945 where he was wounded and hospitalised for sometime. In 1946, he was posted in different parts of India such as Deolali, Mathura, and Kalyan as an army officer.\n\nDuring the same time, he served as an infantry instructor at the Indian Military Academy at Dehradun. His British superiors had sneak suspicion that Captain Tikka Khan who was in the Academy not by merit but by favouritism. At the GHQ India, Tikka Khan was often subjected to jokes by his British officers.\n\nAfter the partition that followed the independence of Pakistan, Tikka Khan opted for Pakistan and joined the Pakistan Army as a Major where he was the only artillery officer in the Pakistan Army's Regiment of Artillery in 1947. His military career progressed well and got accelerated promotions in the army. In 1949, he was promoted as Lieutenant-Colonel and commander of his unit. He worked hard to raised the Medium Regiment in the new army and commanded the first post of the artillery regiment. In 1950–54, he was promoted as Colonel and became the deputy director (Dy Director) at the Regiment of Artillery.\n\nIn 1955, his promotion was approved for one-star rank and was promoted as Brigadier to command the Medium Regiment. In 1962, Tikka Khan was promoted as Major-General and posted at the GHQ in Rawalpindi.\n\nIn 1965, Major-General Tikka Khan was the GOC of the 8th Infantry Division that was positioned in Punjab, Pakistan. At that time, the 8th Infantry Division was consisted of 51 Paratrooper Brigade and 52 Infantry Brigade; in April 1965, the 8th Infantry Division intruded into the Rann of Kutch from Southern Command. Hostilities broke out in 1965 between India and Pakistan and Tikka Khan's 8th Infantry Division engaged in the battle with the Indian Army. He witnessed the tank battle in Chawinda, Punjab that is remembered as one of the largest tank battles in history since the Battle of Kursk in World War II. During the 1965 war, Tikka Khan earned reputation as a victor of Rann of Kutch and credited widely by the print media over the victories he gained over the Indian Army. He made a bold stand against the Indian Army's encirclement in the Sialkot sector in 1965. In addition, he also led the 15th Infantry Division, also in the 1965 war.\n\nAfter President Ayub Khan handed over the presidency to his army chief General Yahya Khan in 1969, Tikka Khan was promoted to three-star assignment and made Lieutenant-General to command the IV Corps, stationed in Lahore. He was the martial law administrator of Punjab under President Yahya Khan who appointed him after replacing with Attiqur Rahman. His personality was well known in Pakistan as being tough and ruthless. In March 1971, Tikka Khan was sent to Dacca and left the post to Lt Gen Bahadur Sher in March 1971.\n\nThe situation was very complex in both West and East Pakistan after the general elections held in 1970 where the Bengali nationalist Awami League won 167 of the 169 seats in East Pakistan, whereas the leftist-socialist Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) won 81 seats out of 138 in West Pakistan. By constitution, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of Awami League was supposed to be the candidate for the post of Prime Minister of Pakistan but Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan Peoples Party was not ready to accept his role as Leader of the Opposition and refused to sit in the National Assembly as opposition party.\n\nUnder pressure by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party, President Yahya Khan postponed the National Assembly session despite meeting and inviting Awami League to form the government on 7 March. As a reaction, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed the mass rally and called upon the Bengali people to launch the armed liberation movement against Pakistan. Responding to this, President Yahya Khan accepted the resignation of Lieutenant-General Yaqub Khan and appointed Tikka Khan as the governor of East Pakistan. In March 1971, Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan arrived in Dacca took over the governorship of East Pakistan and to command the unified Eastern Command. He has faced accusations of killing thousands of civilians. He succeeded Air Commodore Mitty Masud, and assumed the command of Eastern Military High Command on 26 March 1971.\n\nActing on the instructions provided by President Yahya Khan's administration, Tikka Khan began preparations of \"direct-wise military operation\" against the Awami League on the evening of 25 March 1971. He ordered the arrest of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and outlawed the Awami League and ordered the attack on the University of Dhaka at midnight. Lieutenant-General Tikka Khan was the architect and top planner of Operation Searchlight. Thousands were killed in this operation, including the academia and members of civil society the country was plunged into a bloody civil war. Tikka Khan followed the classical \"Seek and destroy and Infiltration\" method and captured all radio stations in the East Pakistan at the price of systematic killings of Bengali people. In Pakistan alone, he became to known as \"soldier known for his eager use of force\"; he also earned the notoriety and was nicknamed as \"Butcher of Bengal\"\n\nIn West Pakistan, the homegrown criticism grew much farther and Tikka Khan's action was widely disapproved that led to the President Yahya Khan replacing him with the populist civilian set-up. He was immediately called back to Pakistan, and relinquished the unified Eastern Command to Lieutenant-General Amir Khan Niazi. He was given the command of II Strike Corps based on Multan, Punjab. The II Strike Corps was based on two infantry brigades and an armoured regiment and commanded the II Strike Corps during the war with India in 1971. During the 1971 war, Tikka Khan's II Strike Corps casualties were very high: around ~3,000 soldiers were killed and nearly 50 tanks were destroyed by Indian Army. By the time, the ceasefire and surrendered was called, Tikka Khan had earned notoriety among his men and subordinates.\n\nIn 1972, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had disposed Lieutenant-General Gul Hassan as an army commander over the recommendations by Military JAG. Under a reformed set-up, President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto approved the promotion papers of Tikka Khan to four-star rank and appointed him as Chief of Army Staff (COAS) in 1972. Tikka Khan was highly unpopular choice in military circles for the chief of army staff because it was felt strongly that he did not have any clue about his new assignment. The promotion was highly political and had political motives as Tikka Khan was known for his loyalty bestowed to President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. In 1972, he supported the militarisation of Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission by supporting Munir Ahmad Khan to take over its chairmanship and directorship of clandestine atomic bomb programme. His role was implicated in the Hamoodur Rahman Commission but the responsibility issues concerning Tikka Khan were Classified.\n\nIn 1974, he planned out the military operations in Balochistan. In 1976, he provided his support to Ghulam Ishaq Khan and Bhutto to expand and support the clandestine programme. In 1976, Tikka Khan was set to retire from the military and send the proposals for his possible eight successors. Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto asked for his opinion on Lieutenant-General Zia-ul-Haq's military career which Tikka Khan did not recommend supporting him as chief of army staff. Tikka Khan reportedly marked to Bhutto as: I thought, he was dull. In any case, he was the most junior of all eight serving lieutenant-generals.\" However, Bhutto by-passed his recommendations and approved Lieutenant-General Zia-ul-Haq to four-star rank and appointed him as army chief. Upon retirement from army, Khan joined the Pakistan Peoples Party and was appointed as National Security Advisor in Bhutto's cabinet.\n\nTikka Khan was appointed and elevated as National Security Advisor in 1976 with a status of federal minister by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. However, his tenure was short and terminated when the martial law was imposed by army chief General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977. General Zia ordered the military police to arrest both Bhutto and General Tikka Khan and placed them under house arrest. Bhutto was executed in 1979, after which General Tikka Khan emerged as one of the leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), becoming its Secretary General, during a time when many party stalwarts abandoned it.\n\nIn 1980–88, Tikka Khan faced imprisonment numerous times for his political activities until President Zia-ul-Haq died in August 1988 in an aircraft explosion over Bahawalpur. Despite Tikka's political inclinations, many of Tikka's army protégés such as Sawar Khan, Iqbal Khan and Rahimuddin Khan were promoted to four-star rank and remained on deferential terms with him. Tikka Khan participated well in the general elections held in 1988 from Rawalpindi constituency. He was appointed as the Governor of Punjab by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in December 1988. His governorship was terminated by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan after dismissing the government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in August 1990, after which he retired from active politics.\n\nTikka Khan retired from politics and lived a very quiet life in Rawalpindi, Punjab. Throughout the 1990s, he battled with his illness and hospitalised in CMH Rawalpindi for several years. He refused many television interviews on the course of 1971 episodes and died on 28 March 2002.\n\nHe was laid to rest with military honours in the Westridge cemetery in Rawalpindi. In his funeral attendance were the Chairman joint chiefs Aziz Khan, army chief, air chief, naval chief and other senior military and civil officials. Benazir Bhutto paid him a rich tribute in the television and directed a message to Tikka Khan's son, Colonel Khalid Khan, where Benazir Bhutto noted that: \"Tikka Khan, who had spent many years campaigning with the General [Tikka Khan]\", remembered him as a person who, \"rose to the highest offices of this country due to his hard work and respect for the rule of law.\"\n\n\n\n"}

It reached a zenith of popularity between 1820 and 1830, and hosted such spectacles as dog-fighting, cock-fighting, bear-baiting, badger-baiting, monkey-baiting, and rat-baiting. A legal enterprise at the time, the Westminster Pit openly declared its activities, ushering notoriety on the district in which it existed. \n\nThe Westminster Pit was located on Duck Lane, Orchard Street (since renamed St. Matthew's Street), and its dimensions were approximately by . The gallery was above the arena and was capable of containing 200 people – or, by report of William Pitt Lennox, \"perhaps a greater number of less refractory persons, for the common run of spectators were so obstreperous and so agitated by various emotions, according to the amount of bets depending, and the various turns of the conflict, that a decent orderly person would feel himself much incommoded by a considerably less number.\"\n\nPrior to the beginning of matches, the stakes would be formalised and the dogs weighed. It was common in the Westminster Pit (and other venues like it) for cheating to occur, often by way of covering a dog with substances – such as acid or pepper – that would deter his opponent from biting him. For this reason, it was compulsory that all combatants be washed in water or milk, and a participant was permitted to lick his opponent's dog as a precaution.\n\nPerhaps the most famous dog to perform in the Westminster Pit was a Bull and Terrier named \"Billy\", whose fame was his rat-baiting ability. The October 1822 edition of \"The Sporting Magazine\" describes his feat of killing 100 rats in six minutes and twenty-five seconds: almost six minutes faster than what was wagered. Billy's best time ever is recorded as five minutes, or slightly over \"by a very few seconds\". The name of Billy's owner is not consistently documented: some sources refer to a Charles Dew, some to Charley Westropp, and others to Charley Aistrop. Pierce Egan gives Billy's date of death as 23 February 1829. Later commentators have questioned the legitimacy of Billy's success; in particular, James Rodwell, in his 1858 \"The rat: its history & destructive character: With numerous anecdotes\", stated: \"let it be borne in mind, and I assert it on the testimony of living witnesses, that numbers of the rats were dead before the dog commenced, and that the whole had been poisoned with nux-vomica before being put into the pit . . . and when he did commence, several were thrown out as dead that were able to crawl away\".\n\nIn 1830, an indictment was lodged against the Westminster Pit by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. The Society charged the proprietor, John King, with a nuisance, while noting that it was \"indebted to corporal Denny, of No. 17, Queen Square, Westminster, and to James Yewen, of No. 6, Horseferry Road, Westminster . . . for obtaining a sufficient number of witnesses, residing on the spot, to prove the case as a nuisance.\" King was convicted, and, according to \"The Cottager's monthly visitor\", \"the prosecution completely suppressed that notorious sink of cruelty and vice\".\n"}

A inch silver star was authorized to be worn on the ribbon of the Victory Medal for any member of the U.S. Army who had been cited for gallantry in action between 1917 and 1920. In 1932, the Citation Star (\"Silver Star\") was redesigned and renamed the Silver Star Medal and, upon application to the United States War Department, any holder of the Silver Star Citation could have it converted to a Silver Star medal.\n\nThe Navy Commendation Star to the World War I Victory Medal was authorized to any person who had been commended by the Secretary of the Navy for performance of duty during the First World War. A inch silver star was worn on the World War I Victory Medal, identical in appearance to the Army's Citation Star. Unlike the Army's version, however, the Navy Commendation Star could not be upgraded to the Silver Star medal.\n\nThe following battle clasps, inscribed with a battle's name, were worn on the medal to denote participation in major ground conflicts.\nFor general defense service, not involving a specific battle, the \"Defensive Sector\" Battle Clasp was authorized. The clasp was also awarded for any battle which was not already recognized by its own battle clasp.\n\nThe World War I Victory Medal bears the clasps of the battles the U.S. Army participated in across the ribbon. Not all battles are shown on the bar clasps. Only the battles designated as battles that would have bars issued were shown on the medal. The famous Battle of Chateau Thierry to hold the Chateau and the bridge as a joint effort between the US Army and the US Marines against the German machine gunners did not get awarded clasps.\n\nNavy battle clasps were issued for naval service in support of Army operations and had identical names to the Army battle clasps. There was a slight variation of the criteria dates for the Navy battle clasps, as listed below.\nThe Defensive Sector Clasp was also authorized for Navy personnel who had participated in naval combat but were not authorized a particular battle clasp.\n\nFor sea-related war duty, the Navy issued the following operational clasps, which were worn on the World War I Victory Medal and inscribed with the name of the duty type which had been performed:\nUnlike the army, the navy only allowed one clasp of any type to be worn on the ribbon. Members of the marine or medical corps who served in France but was not eligible for a battle clasp would receive a bronze Maltese cross on their ribbons.\n\nFor non-combat service with the army during the First World War, the following service clasps were authorized to be worn with the World War I Victory Medal. Each service claps was inscribed with a country or region name where support service was performed. The U.S. Army issued the following service clasps:\nThe U.S. Navy issued similar service clasps to the Army for service in the following regions during the following periods:\nSince battle and service clasps could only be worn on the full-sized World War I Victory Medal, 3/16 inch bronze service stars were authorized for wear on the award ribbon. This was the common method of campaign and battle display when wearing the World War I Victory Medal as a ribbon on a military uniform.\n\nMedals issued to U.S. Marines were issued with a Maltese cross device affixed to the ribbon.\n\nThe World War I Victory Medals were awarded after the end of World War I, so they were mailed to the servicemen instead of awarded in person. For example, the boxes containing the Victory Medals for United States Army World War I veterans were mailed out by the depot officer at the General Supply Depot, U.S. Army, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in April 1921. An outer light brown box with an address label glued to it and its postage area marked \"OFFICIAL BUSINESS, Penalty for private use $300\" contained an inner white box stamped with the bars the serviceman was supposed to receive on his medal. The inner white box contained the medal, which was wrapped in tissue paper.<br>\n\nOnly after filling out the application form A.G.O. No. 740 with the help of an authorized officer could it be officially forwarded to the Philadelphia Quartermaster Intermediate Depot for the veteran then to receive his medal by mail. The Army started issuing Victory Medals on June 21, 1920, not April 1921 as listed above. The Navy had a late start due to production issues and started in August 1920.\n\nIn 1945, the \"Victory Ribbon\" was created as an award for those who served in World War II. Between 1945 and 1947, the World War I award continued to be known by its original name, the \"Victory Medal\", and the World War II award was known as the \"Victory Ribbon\". In 1947, the Victory Ribbon became a full-sized medal as the World War II Victory Medal, at which point the World War I Victory Medal adopted its current name. However, some military records as late as the 1950s continued to annotate the World War I decoration by its previous name, and the medal was often referred to as \"Victory Medal (WWI)\".\n\nNot only did the United States issue a Victory Medal, but so did a significant number of Allied and associated countries involved in the conflict against the Dual Alliance between Austria and Germany.\n\nThe proposition of such a common award was first made by French Maréchal Ferdinand Foch who was supreme commander of the Allied Forces during the First World War. Each medal in bronze has the same diameter (36 mm) and ribbon (double rainbow), but with a national design representing a winged victory.\n\nMain source:\n\n"}

{"id": "706371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=706371", "title": "Åland Islands dispute", "text": "Åland Islands dispute\n\nThe Åland Islands dispute was one of the first issues put up for arbitration by the League of Nations on its formation. The Åland Islands' population's demand for self-determination was not met and sovereignty over the islands was retained by Finland, but international guarantees were given to allow the population to pursue its own culture, relieving the threat of forced assimilation by Finnish culture as perceived by the islanders.\n\nPrior to 1809, the Åland Islands were located within the boundaries of the Swedish realm. However, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809, Sweden had to give up control of the islands, along with Finland, to Imperial Russia. The Grand Duchy of Finland became an autonomous entity, including the Åland Islands, within the Russian Empire. By the Treaty of Paris of April 18, 1856, which ended the Crimean War, Britain required Russia to withhold the construction of any new fortifications on the islands. This stipulation was obeyed, despite unsuccessful attempts to change the status of the demilitarised islands in 1908. However, in 1914, at the start of the First World War, the Russian government turned the islands into a submarine base for the use of British and Russian submarines during the war.\n\nIn December 1917, fearing the effects of the Russian October Revolution, the Finnish parliament proclaimed that Finland was now a sovereign state, calling on the principles of national self-determination. The very same autumn, Ålanders had organized for their own self-determination, fearing what they saw as excessive expressions of pro-Finnishness and anti-Swedishness in Finland. By this time, well above 90% of the islands' inhabitants considered themselves Swedish, stationed military personnel excluded, in contrast to Mainland Finland, where less than 15% were Swedish-speaking. Unlike in Åland, in the previous twenty years social tensions had also worsened considerably in Finland. The Ålanders' answer was a wish for secession from the Grand Duchy of Finland and the Russian Empire, to which they felt little affiliation, and a request for annexation by Sweden.\n\nSweden's power elite was, however, preoccupied with Sweden's democratization that was recently commenced by a conservative cabinet in order to quench the revolutionary currents among Swedish workers. To that effect, Sweden got a new liberal prime minister, and for the first time socialists in the cabinet. Although activist circles close to the royal court were enthusiastic towards the Ålanders' plea for Swedish support, the activists had lost their political influence in 1916, and ultimately also the ear of King Gustav V. Representatives for the Ålanders were fed sympathetic words and empty phrases. Neither the Liberals nor the Socialists leading Sweden through the last year of World War I were the slightest bit interested in anything that had to do with activist adventurist policies; the king fully agreed with his cabinet on this point.\n\nThe Finnish Civil War starting in January 1918, initially did not change this situation. Sweden's Social Democrats had the year before purged the revolutionaries from the party, and were sympathetic but unsupportive of the socialist republic in Finland. Their coalition partners in the cabinet, the Liberals, were rather inclined to sympathize with the White government in Finland, but they were traditionally neutralist and additionally rather suspicious of their Finnish counterparts. Those non-socialists in Finland who were not ardent fennomans seemed to the Swedish Liberals more like the Conservatives they were used to viewing as their political enemies. \n\nExaggerated reports of civilian apprehension concerning the approaching combatants of the civil war resulted, however, in the dispatch of a minor Swedish naval expedition, tasked with evacuating civilians who wished it. It turned out that no civilians wished evacuation, but the naval commander proudly brokered an end to hostilities and remained on the Main Island as a peace-keeping force. It is evident that the chain of command was considerably more inclined towards activism than the Socialist Minister of Defence, who in turn was persuaded to be considerably more supportive of intervention than his cabinet colleagues. It is less clear to what degree other cabinet members were briefed in between cabinet meetings, or even whether they had a say. Stockholm did not perceive anything of moment, and anything that happened was unintended by the government and well-intentioned by the naval officer in charge.\n\nThe White government in Vaasa saw it differently. They were bitter over the lack of support from Sweden against the socialist rebels, and well-informed about activist desires to re-acquire the Åland Islands, since many of the Swedish military officers who volunteered to come to White Finland's support were close to the leading activists. The White government was alarmed by the arrival of Swedish troops on Finnish soil, and suspicious of Sweden's Socialist Minister of Defence. A German naval force was urgently asked to remove the Swedish troops from Åland.\n\nThe leading Swedish Social Democrat, Hjalmar Branting, opted for dealing with the issue purely from the standpoint of international law. The cabinet of Finland viewed this position as a purely tactical one, and a dispute over whether the islands rightfully belonged to Sweden or Finland ensued. In 1921, again despite the fact that 90 percent of the islands' population was Swedish—and that they expressed an almost unanimous desire of being incorporated into Sweden—the League of Nations determined that the Åland Islands should remain under Finnish sovereignty, which is often attributed to the skill of its Minister to Paris, Carl Enckell, who also was envoy to the League of Nations in charge of Finland's presentation of the Åland question. \n\nMerit is also attributed to Finland's Envoy to Japan, professor G.J. Ramstedt, who managed to point out to the Japanese delegation in the League of Nations that the Åland Islands are in fact a continuous archipelago that joins it with Finland, and furthermore, that deep sea waters separate them from Sweden. Japan's own interests in controlling Pacific islands would be aided by such a precedent, and it consequently gave important support to Finland.\n\nThe interrelated difficulties in the relations between Sweden and Finland were resolved by the mid-1930s, when the weakened authority of the League of Nations signalled a much harsher international mood. The fear of the Åland Islands' falling under the control of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union was very real, and that is why Sweden's Foreign Minister Sandler proposed retaining the status of the islands despite Sweden's longstanding policy of neutrality. Detailed defensive plans were made; however, in the end, Sweden opted not to participate in the defence of the islands.\n\nIn 1920, Finland granted wide-reaching cultural and political autonomy to the Åland Islands. The League of Nations considered these measures as satisfying demands to protect the Swedish language and culture there.\n\nDuring the course of the 20th century, Finnish sovereignty had been perceived as benevolent, and even beneficial, by increasing numbers of the islanders. Together with disappointment over insufficient support from Sweden in the League of Nations, Swedish disrespect for Åland's demilitarized status in the 1930s, and to some degree a feeling of shared destiny with Finland during and after World War II, this has resulted in a changed perception of Åland's relation to Finland: from \"a Swedish province in Finnish possession\" to \"an autonomous part of Finland\".\n\n\n"}
