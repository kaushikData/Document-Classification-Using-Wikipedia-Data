The ball is held in a hangar at the Boulder Airport and features World War II-era airplanes including C-45 Expeditors and B-25 Mitchells. The ball also holds an annual 1940s White Christmas Ball. Net proceeds from the event are donated to local charities including those that support World War II veterans and the preservation of aviation history.\n\nThe 1940s World War II Era Ball was first held in 2008. The ball was founded by Khyentse James, who previously founded the Decibelle Music and Culture Festival. The ball was created in honor of James' grandparents, who were radio performers and met while they were working at a radio station together in the 1940s.\n\nIn 2016, the ball expanded to two nights for its eighth annual event. The theme was \"Our Troops Bring Home Paradise: A Tiki Explosion\" and included car shows, film screenings and other events.\n\n"}

The dark Jovian asteroid belongs to the 100 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 13.5 hours. It was discovered on 9 November 1999, by Japanese amateur astronomer Takao Kobayashi at his private Ōizumi Observatory in Gunma Prefecture, Japan, and later named after the Achaean warrior Orus from Greek mythology.\n\n\"Orus\" is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance . It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.3 AU once every 11 years and 7 months (4,240 days; semi-major axis of 5.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery, published by the Digitized Sky Survey and taken at Palomar Observatory in November 1951, or 48 years prior to its official discovery observation.\n\n\"Orus\" is planned to be visited by the \"Lucy\" spacecraft which will launch in 2021. The fly by is scheduled for 20 November 2028, and will approach the asteroid to a distance of 1000 kilometers at a velocity of 7.1 kilometers per second. The mission's targets with their flyby dates are:\n\n\"Orus\" is characterized as a D-type and C-type asteroid by the \"Lucy\" mission team and by PanSTARRS photometric survey, respectively. It has a V–I color index of 0.95, seem among most larger D-type Jupiter trojans.\n\nThe first photometric observations of \"Orus\" have been made in October 2009, by astronomer Stefano Mottola in a photometric lightcurve survey of 80 Jupiter trojans, using the 1.2-meter telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. The obtained rotational lightcurve rendered a period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.18 magnitude ().\n\nIn 2016, Mottola published a revised rotation period of , from ground-based observations taken over five apparitions in support of the \"Lucy\" mission. He finds that Orus is a retrograde rotator. The lightcurve suggests the presence of a large crater in the proximity of its north pole.\n\nAccording to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the body has an albedo of 0.083 and 0.075, with a diameter of 53.87 and 50.81 kilometers, respectively. The \"Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link\" assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous C-type asteroids of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 55.67 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 10.0.\n\nThis minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Orus, an Achaean warrior in Homer's \"Iliad\". He was killed in the Trojan War by the Trojan prince Hector, after whom the largest Jupiter trojan 624 Hektor is named. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 February 2016 ().\n\n\n"}

The play's title refers to Dante Alighieri's Inferno—in which Dante navigates a descent into the \"nine circles of hell\". In Cain's play, Green passes through his discharge from the Army and various judicial and administrative procedures, roughly paralleling the nine circles of Dante's \"Inferno\". Cain structured the play so other cast members would return to play multiple characters, at each different circle.\n\nThe play won praise for being nuanced, and not taking the easy path of demonizing the protagonist. However, Chris Jones, reviewing a Chicago production of the play, reported that audience members concluded the play meant to imply that Green, who was originally from Midland, Texas, which had been United States President George W. Bush's primary home, had the assistance of the President himself in clearing his entry into the Army in spite of his criminal record.\n\nThe play is receiving its Texas premiere in San Antonio, Texas with The Surround Project's production in June 2017.\n\nThe script won the Steinberg Award.

Pioneering, having brought together names such as Mike Figgis, Alejandro Jodorowsky, Erwin Olaf, Nobuyoshi Araki, WIng Shya, Steven Klein, Chris Cunningham, Chloë Sevigny, Ruth Hogben, Georgie Greville, Elisha Smith-Leverock, Waris Ahluwalla, Maison Yves Saint Laurent, Nick Knight, Johan Renck, Jerry Schatzberg, William Klein, Tim Yip, Larry Clark, Ellen Von Unwerth, Bruce Weber, Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin, Indrani, Rossy de Palma, Michael Nyman and welcomed by: Centre Pompidou, Jeu de Paume, Milano's Palazzo Morando, FIAF, NYC, Festival du nouveau cinema Montreal, CPH-DOX, Barbican Art Gallery, Guggenheim, Bilbao, Pica Contemporary Art Museum, Perth with the support of Italian Vogue, Bvlgari, Dom Perignon, FIAF and Kering.\n\nDiane Pernet's first degree was in documentary film making at Temple University and she has been making small low-fi movies for years. She also worked as a costume designer for, amongst others, director Amos Gitai. So the founder of ASVOFF knows how important fashion is in a film.\n\nBesides its annual festival in Paris in September, ASVOFF has other projects around the world.\n\nOther places on the ASVOFF list\n\nMark Eley of Eley Kishimoto commissioned her to make a road movie for the launch of his new menswear line. It was a short film that documented his participation in the GUMBALL 3000 which was a car race that went from London to Monte Carlo. The 18-minute film was called The Adventure of Pleasure.\n\nShe showed the film to Dino Dinco, her Los Angeles collaborator at the time and he asked her if she wanted to screen it in LA. A day later EGR (Enrique Gonzalez Rangel), her Mexico City contributor, sent her a fashion film that he made and Pernet posted it on her blog. The idea to create a travelling fashion film festival had been on the back burner for years before Pernet showed Adventure of Pleasure to Dinco. The name \"You Wear It Well,\" was based on a Rod Stewart song. The first fashion film festival, \"You Wear It Well,\" launched in August 2006, premiering in Los Angeles at Cinespace. Dinco and Pernet arranged a second edition of \"You Wear It Well\" in 2007.\n\nBesides the work of Diane Pernet and EGR, You Wear It Well featured video creations from Maison Martin Margiela, Nick Knight/Alexander McQueen, Jeremy Scott, Bernhard Willhelm, Marcelo Krasilcic, Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, NOKI and Ruben Toledo.\n\nIn November 2007 Diane Pernet also co-curated the NOOVO fashion and photography festival in Santiago de Compostela.\n\"You Wear It Well\" was dissolved in 2007 when Pernet with the support of her current producer, David Herman, took the festival from a one-day program to a three-day program and to make it an extension of the ASVOF blog, hence the name ASVOFF (A Shaded View on Fashion Film). In September 2008, ASVOFF was launched in Paris at Jeu de Paume.\n\n\n\nThe festival moved to Passage du Désir/ BETC, followed by an award ceremony held at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris with jury president Rick Owens. Due to the growing size of the selection, it was separated in two sections – Reflection (directors vision of fashion) and Communication (communication of one brand/designer).\n\nOn 8 October, the Jury headed by Rick Owens handed out awards for the ASVOFF 2009 Fashion Film competition:\n\nThe festival took place on 24, 25 and 26 September at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, with running installations of the festival's competition films held at the BETC's Passage du Desir from 25–28 September.\n\nFor this edition Diane Pernet worked together with the young fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson.\n\n\n\n\nThe festival was held at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\n\n\nThe festival was held at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\n\n\nThe festival was held at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.\n\n\nFashion film aperitivo by Peroni: Nastro Azurro, live performance by Joana Preiss at Cannes Magnum Beach\n\n\n\nCannes: Special Fashion Film Aperitivo Silencio 5 rue des Belges, Cannes on May 19, 2014 with projections of \"Travelling at Night with Jim Jarmusch\" (documentary by Lea Rinaldi) and short films by Julien Landais with Nora Arnezeder, and Alain Fabien Delon.

It was divided into the following:\n\nThe Allied administration was done by the United Kingdom in Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and by France in Fezzan. Officially Libya remained \"Italian Libya\" until February 1947, when Italy signed the Peace Treaty losing all the colonies and possessions of the defeated former Italian Empire.\n\nThe British administered it as the British Military Administration of Libya.\n\nThe French forces occupied the area that was the former Italian Territorio Sahara Libico and made several requests to annex administratively their Fezzan to the French colonial Empire. The administrative personnel remained the former Italian bureaucrats.\n\nIn November 1942, the Allied forces retook Cyrenaica. By February 1943, the last German and Italian soldiers were driven from Libya and the Allied occupation of Libya began.\n\nIn the early post-war period, Tripolitania and Cyrenaica remained under British administration, while the French controlled Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in Cairo but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal in 1947 of some aspects of foreign control. Under the terms of the 1947 peace treaty with the Allies, Italy, which hoped to maintain the colony of Tripolitania, (and France, which wanted the Fezzan), relinquished all claims to Libya. Libya so remained united.\n\nSevere anti-Jewish violence erupted in Libya following the liberation of North Africa by Allied troops. From November 5 to November 7, 1945, more than 140 Jews (including 36 children) were killed and hundreds injured in a pogrom in Tripoli. Five synagogues in Tripoli and four in provincial towns were destroyed, and over 1,000 Jewish residences and commercial buildings were plundered in Tripoli alone.\n\nIn June 1948, anti-Jewish rioters in Libya killed another 12 Jews and destroyed 280 Jewish homes. The fear and insecurity which arose from these anti-Jewish attacks and the founding of the state of Israel led many Jews to flee Libya. From 1948 to 1951, 30,972 Libyan Jews moved to Israel. By the 1970s, the rest of Libyan Jews (some 7,000) were evacuated to Italy.\n\nIdris as-Senussi, the Emir of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica and the leader of the Senussi Muslim Sufi order, represented Libya in the UN negotiations, and on 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence with representatives from Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan declaring a union with the country being called the United Kingdom of Libya, and Idris as-Senussi being offered the crown. In accordance with the constitution the new country had a federal government with the three states of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan having autonomy. The kingdom also had three capital cities: Tripoli, Benghazi and Bayda. Two years after independence, on 28 March 1953, Libya joined the Arab League.\n\nWhen Libya declared its independence on 24 December 1951, ending the Allied occupation of Libya, it was the first country to achieve independence through the United Nations and one of the first former European possessions in Africa to gain independence.\n\n"}

It was created, directed, and produced by actor and filmmaker Sonja Sohn and HBO Films. It covers the death of Freddie Gray, the protests and riots immediately following, efforts to keep the peace during the unsuccessful prosecutions of the six police officers involved, as well as efforts to change policing by both the Maryland General Assembly and the US Department of Justice. It includes segments covering the perspective of Black Lives Matter protesters, community leaders, and members of the Baltimore Police Department.\n\nAmong the protesters, it focuses on Kwame Rose and Makayla Gilliam-Price, two young (17-21 years old) activists. Among community leaders, the documentary shows Adam Jackson and Dayvon Love, members of the group Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle. Among the police, \"Baltimore Rising\" includes Lt. Colonel Melvin Russell, head of a community affairs program in the BPD; Dawnyell Taylor, the lead police investigator into the death of Gray; and interim police commissioner Kevin Davis, who came to his position shortly after Gray's death.\n\n\"Baltimore Rising\" premiered on HBO on November 20, 2017.\n\nMelanie McFarland of \"Slate\" praised the documentary, writing it accurately communicated the \"systemic and entrenched\" problems on both sides: police who feel unsafe, retreat to their cars, and see everyone as potentially dangerous suspects, which furthers the alienation felt by the community and by the activists. She also felt that while it provided no neat conclusions or solutions, it accurately presented and summarized the many conflicting voices and opinions in the conflict. Hank Steuver of \"The Washington Post\" called \"Baltimore Rising\" simultaneously fascinating, scattered, and frustrating. He felt that this reflected the disorganized nature of the protests and the difficulties with channeling grievances into useful systemic change, however, so the frustration was authentic and accurate to the source material. David Zurawick of \"The Baltimore Sun\" thought \"Rising\" was excellent, especially its \"brilliant\" opening, but felt it was somewhat too lenient in its treatment of the Baltimore police's efforts, which he felt should have been examined more skeptically.\n\n"}

This will help scientists understand the health threat from cosmic rays and deep space environment on living organisms and reduce the risk associated with long-term human exploration, as NASA plans to send humans farther into space than ever before.\n\nBioSentinel is one of thirteen low-cost CubeSat missions selected as secondary payloads for the first test flight of NASA's Space Launch System called Exploration Mission 1. The spacecraft will be deployed in cis-lunar space. The BioSentinel mission will be NASA's first time since Apollo 17 in 1972, to send living organisms to deep space (beyond low Earth orbit).\n\nThe primary objective of BioSentinel is to develop a biosensor using a simple model organism (yeast) to detect, measure, and correlate the impact of space radiation to living organisms over long durations beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) and into heliocentric orbit. While progress has been made with simulations, no terrestrial laboratory can duplicate the unique space radiation environment.\n\nThe BioSentinel biosensor uses the budding yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" to detect and measure double-strand breaks (DSBs) on DNA that occur in response to ambient space radiation. This yeast strain was selected because its DSB repair mechanisms are well studied and are very similar to those in human cells. The biosensor consists of specifically engineered yeast strains and nutrient selection strategies that ensure that only cells that can repair their DSBs will grow in specialized media. Therefore, culture growth and metabolic activity of yeast cells directly indicate a successful DSB-and-repair event.\n\nAfter completing the Moon flyby and spacecraft checkout, the science mission phase will begin with the wetting of the first set of yeast-containing wells with specialized media. Multiple sets of wells will be activated at different time points over the 18-month mission. One reserve set of wells will be activated in the occurrence of a solar particle event (SPE). Approximately, a 4 to 5 krad total ionizing dose is anticipated. Payload science data and spacecraft telemetry will be stored on board and then downloaded to the ground.\n\nBiological measurements will be compared to data provided by onboard radiation sensors and dosimeters. Additionally, three identical BioSentinel payloads will be developed for comparison reference, one of them will be exposed at low Earth orbit outside the International Space Station (ISS), where there is a comparatively low-radiation environment due to Earth's magnetic field protecting the space station.\n\nThe Biosentinel spacecraft will consist on a 6U CubeSat bus format, with external dimensions of 10×20×30 cm and a mass of about . At launch, BioSentinel resides within the second stage on the launch vehicle from which it is deployed to a lunar flyby trajectory and into an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit.\n\nOf the total 6 Units volume, 4 Units will hold the science payload, including a radiation dosimeter and a dedicated 3-color spectrometer for each well; 1U will house the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) and 1U will house the attitude control thruster assembly, which will be 3D printed all in one piece: cold gas (DuPont R236fa) propellant tanks, lines and seven nozzles. The use of 3D printing also allows the optimization of space for increased propellant storage (165 grams). The thrust of each nozzle is 50 mN, and a specific impulse of 31 seconds. The attitude control system is being developed and fabricated by the Georgia Institute of Technology. \n\nElectric power will be generated by deployable solar panels rated at 30W, and telecommunications will rely on the Iris transponder at X band.\n\nThe spacecraft is being developed by NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NASA Johnson Space Center, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA Headquarters, Loma Linda University Medical Center, and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1449800", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1449800", "title": "Breaking news", "text": "Breaking news\n\nBreaking news, interchangeably termed late-breaking news and also known as a special report or special coverage or news bulletin, is a current issue that broadcasters feel warrants the interruption of scheduled programming and/or current news in order to report its details. Its use is also assigned to the most significant story of the moment or a story that is being covered live. It could be a story that is simply of wide interest to viewers and has little impact otherwise. Many times, breaking news is used after the news organization has already reported on the story. When a story has not been reported on previously, the graphic and phrase \"Just In\" is sometimes used instead.\n\nThe format of a \"special report\" or \"breaking news\" event on television commonly consists of the current non-news programming (or, in some cases, regularly scheduled newscasts) suddenly switching to a reverse countdown, usually from 5 seconds, to allow any affiliated stations to switch to the network news feed (television stations typically do not provide these countdowns for local coverage, normally leading with a graphic and/or voiceover announcing the cut-in). If a national network newscast is in progress when the breaking news event occurs, the newscast will pause temporarily to allow other network affiliates to join the network news feed.\nThere is then an opening graphic, featuring music (such as NBC's \"The Pulse of Events\", composed by John Williams) which adds an emphasis on the importance of the event. This is usually followed by the introduction of a news anchor, who welcomes the viewer to the broadcast and introduces the story at hand. Lower thirds and other graphics may also be altered to convey a sense of urgency. \n\nOnce the story is introduced, the network or local station may, if possible, choose to continue to show a live shot of the anchor or may cut away to video or images of the story that is being followed during the broadcast. Additionally, the coverage may be passed to a reporter at the location of the breaking event, possibly sharing more information about the story as it breaks.\n\nDepending upon the story being followed, the report may last only a few minutes, or continue for multiple hours – or with the longest uninterrupted news events, four days – at a time (events in which the latter instances has occurred include the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the September 11 attacks, which took place between November 22–26, 1963 and September 11–15, 2001, respectively). If coverage continues for an extended amount of time, the network may integrate analysis about the story through analysts in-studio, via phone, satellite, broadband (B-GAN) or through other means of communication. Depending on the severity of the event, regular commercial advertising may be completely suspended for sustained coverage, and network affiliates will be required to insert their station identification in at the top of the hour overlaid during the report rather than through the usual means of a station imaging promo or program reminder. \n\nIf a story occurs during the Early Fringe timeslot and depending on the magnitude of the events at hand, local stations might be given the opportunity to break away from the network feed and begin their evening newscasts. This is set up by a cue from the network's talent that they will pause for a few seconds to reset coverage, at which point an opening graphic may be rolled again. Information is also disseminated from an internal alert service utilized by a station's master control. After the local newscast, stations will likely return to the network's feed as they normally would for the nightly news, but they may be joining in on an \"extended edition\". Whether or not a station will take over for local news is usually the choice of that station's news director.\n\nWhen the coverage comes to a close, the network or station may either resume programming that was occurring prior to the event or begin new programming (if the breaking news occurs during a newscast the network will switch back to the newscast upon completion if time permits), depending upon the amount of time spent on the coverage. The anchor will usually remind viewers to check the network's website (or that of the station, if coverage is provided locally), or watch any cable news channels that may be co-owned with the network for more information. If the story breaks during daytime programming, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be or might be more details on their local news that day and a full wrap-up on the network's evening news program. Usually, regular daytime programming is re-joined in progress and segments may be missed.\n\nIf the event occurs during prime time, the anchor will usually remind viewers that there will be more details on their late local newscast and on the network's overnight news program (if applicable) the next morning. Programming at this time is either joined in progress or started back up at the point of the interruption, depending on whether the program is new to air, highly rated or has time left in its time slot to finish airing (for instance, ABC's breaking news report involving the April 2017 Shayrat missile strike took into account a new episode of the popular series \"Scandal\", where the show was resumed right at the point of interruption twice for those reports; NBC's coverage featured the low-rated \"\" joined in the middle of an episode in progress after their special report without any of that consideration). In either of the above instances, network (and in some cases, for local stations, syndicated) programs that have segments not aired or are pre-empted in their entirety by breaking news reports – particularly those that extend to or longer than 20 or 45 minutes, depending on the length of the previously scheduled program – may have to be rescheduled to air at a later time. \n\nSome events, like State of the Union addresses and presidential debates, are scheduled to start at the top of the hour during prime time. Under those circumstances, regularly scheduled network programming is preempted for the entire duration of the event. If there is sufficient time (generally 60 minutes or more) remaining in prime time, the network may broadcast its next regularly scheduled program in its entirety or join regularly scheduled programming in progress. However, if there is insufficient time remaining for any prime-time programs, the special report will continue until the network affiliates begin airing their late local newscasts.\n\nIn the United States, on days when presidential elections take place, regularly scheduled prime-time programming is suspended so that networks can air up-to-the-minute coverage of the elections. Likewise, regularly scheduled daytime programs are suspended during coverage of presidential inaugurations. However, during those types of events, regular commercial advertising is shown. Similar procedures are enacted for elections or political inaugurations that take place in other countries.\n\nOn radio, the process of a breaking news story is somewhat the same, though some different considerations are made for the medium. For instance, a breaking news theme is required by default to have an urgent tenor and be used only for the purpose of true breaking news or bulletins. This is obvious on the local all-news radio stations owned by Entercom (formerly owned by CBS Radio), which very rarely use a breaking news theme for all but the most urgent and dire of breaking news, and is purposefully structured to give a sense of attention for the listener, almost sounding like an alarm. For local events, continuous coverage may be imposed, or else the station may wait until they have a reporter at the scene and will promise more details of the event as they become available.\n\nNational news that is broadcast over a radio network requires constant monitoring by station employees to allow the network coverage to air, although many stations will take the 'urgent' signal sent by the network and break into programming immediately. Again, continuous coverage from a national radio network depends on the severity of the event, and often the network may just pass down the coverage by their local affiliate with spare commentary by the network's anchors.\n\nOther considerations are made also; FM music stations rarely relay breaking news unless it is an event of grave national concern, though local weather warnings are relayed when in effect (either in the form of updates provided by an on-staff anchor or disc jockey, an emergency alert system or through an audio simulcast of a television station which maintains a contractual partnership with a radio outlet). Less urgent events allow a network to feed updates to stations at 20, 30 and 50 minutes after the hour to give a summary of events. Stations are also careful about what stories are relayed during play-by-play broadcasts of professional and college sports, as those are the programs most listened to on radio, so breaking news coverage is limited to only commercial breaks.\n\nNews bulletins have been a fixture of radio broadcasting since at least the 1920s. Examples of early news bulletins in the Golden Age of Radio include fictionalized versions in the 1938 radio drama \"The War of the Worlds\" and coverage of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which was also the first television news bulletin, reported on stations in New York and Pennsylvania. KTLA in Los Angeles is credited with being the first television station to provide extended coverage of a breaking news event: for 27½ hours from April 8 to 9, 1949, the station carried live coverage of an attempt to rescue three-year-old Kathy Fiscus, who had fallen down an abandoned well in San Marino, California, where she ultimately perished due to asphyxia from a lack of oxygen.\n\nIn the decades before 24-hour news networks such as CNN began to exist, programming interruptions were restricted to extremely urgent news, such as the death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as \"breaking news\" coverage was for the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963, (with CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite's coverage being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour news channels, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as Sky News, largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being \"first for breaking news\".\n\nAnother type of breaking news is that of severe weather events, which had such coverage evolve in a very similar manner. In North America until the 1990s, television and radio stations normally only provided long-form weather coverage during immediate, ongoing threats (such as a tornado that has been confirmed visually or by radar to be producing damage or a landfalling hurricane); cut-ins and, in the case of television stations, alert crawls during regular programming were used otherwise, even when higher-end alerts such as tornado warnings were issued. Advancements in newsgathering and weather technology (including the deployment of helicopters to provide aerial coverage and radar systems that can detect specific storm attributes), coupled with a few highly life-threatening events during the 1990s (such as Hurricane Andrew and the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak) and the resulting heightened urgency to advise those in the storm's path to take safety precautions in advance made extended (or \"wall-to-wall\") weather coverage once a high-end alert is issued more common in storm-prone areas, with cut-ins only being used in weather events of lesser severity.\n\nIn various countries and at various news outlets, terms such as \"(late)breaking\", \"urgent\", \"flash\", \"bulletin\", and \"alert\" may accompany breaking news reports. The term \"breaking news\" has come to replace the older use of \"news bulletin\", with the latter term relegated to only the most extraordinary of events. There has been widespread use of \"breaking news\" at the local level, particularly when one station in a market wants to emphasize the exclusivity of coverage. Not all viewers agree that stories assigned as \"breaking news\" rise to the significance or level of interest that warrant such a designation.\n\nAmerican network news divisions still use the term \"special report\" for either a breaking news, a developing news story or both, but tend to use the term \"breaking news\" on their morning and evening news programs. Most local stations across the United States that interrupt regular programming for a news story use the \"breaking news\" and \"special report\" terms (though, local broadcast news outlets use the former most often), with a voice-over stating either \"This is a breaking news special report\" or \"This is a special breaking news report\" or \"This is a(n) (network name) News Special Report\" or \"This is a(n) (station brand name) breaking news (special) report\" or \"(From [station brand name],) this is breaking news.\" The breaking news ending has a past-tense variation, followed by a disclaimer for viewers who would like more information to see the network's news division website.\n\nHowever, \"special report\" has also been de-emphasized by cable news channels in the United States, as both Fox News Channel and CNN now use that phrase for regular programming; Fox News carries \"Special Report with Bret Baier\", a daily political affairs program, while CNN's \"Special Report\" is a catch-all banner for CNN's library documentary and true crime programming.\n\nIn early coverage of a breaking story, details are commonly sketchy, usually due to the limited information that is available at the time. For example, during the Sago Mine disaster, there were initial reports that all twelve miners were found alive, but news organizations later learned that only one actually survived.\n\nOften it is considered important to be quick with news bulletins also for less important news. Such news might not be updated later, even if it was found that information was wrong or severely incomplete. If someone (e.g. when editing Wikipedia) later wants to research the event, only incomplete information might be found.\n\nAnother criticism has been the diluting of the importance of \"breaking news\" by the need of 24-hour news channels to fill time, applying the title to soft news stories of questionable importance and urgency (for example, car chases). Others question as to whether the use of the term is excessive, citing occasions when the term is used even though scheduled programming is not interrupted. Some programs, such as HLN's defunct \"Nancy Grace\", used the term for recurring coverage of events which occurred months before, even when criminal trial coverage which may deserve the breaking news tag was not occurring and no new information has developed.\n\nIn June 2013, Fox affiliate WDRB in Louisville, Kentucky gained notice in the television industry for a promo that criticized the broad and constant use of the \"breaking news\" term, explaining that it has been overused as a \"marketing ploy\" by other news-producing stations, who tend to apply the term to stories that are low in urgency and/or relevance. To coincide with the promo, on its website, WDRB posted \"Contracts\" with its viewers and advertisers, with the former list promising to use \"breaking news\" judiciously (applying it to stories that are \"both 'breaking' and 'news'\").\n\n"}

{"id": "10293733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10293733", "title": "Combined drug intoxication", "text": "Combined drug intoxication\n\nCombined drug intoxication (CDI), also known as multiple drug intake (MDI) or lethal intoxication, is an unnatural cause of human death. CDI is often confused with drug overdose, but it is a different phenomenon. It is distinct because it is due to the simultaneous use of multiple drugs, whether the drugs are prescription, over-the-counter, recreational, or some other combination. Alcohol can exacerbate the symptoms and may directly contribute to increased severity of symptoms. The reasons for toxicity vary depending on the mixture of drugs. Usually, most victims die after using two or more drugs in combination that suppress breathing, and the low blood oxygen level causes brain death.\n\nThe CDI/MDI phenomenon seems to be becoming more common in recent years. In December 2007, according to Dr. John Mendelson, a pharmacologist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, deaths by combined drug intoxication were relatively \"rare\" (\"one in several million\"), though they appeared then to be \"on the rise\". In July 2008, the Associated Press and CNN reported on a medical study showing that over two decades, from 1983 to 2004, such deaths have soared. It has also become a prevalent risk for older patients.\n\nPeople who engage in polypharmacy and other hypochondriac behaviors are at an elevated risk of death from CDI. Elderly people are at the highest risk of CDI, because of having many age-related health problems requiring many medications combined with age-impaired judgment, leading to confusion in taking medications.\n\nIn general, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs should be carefully monitored by a qualified individual such as board certified and licensed medical doctor, either an MD or DO Close association between prescribing physicians and pharmacies, along with the computerization of prescriptions and patients' medical histories, aim to avoid the occurrence of dangerous drug interactions. Lists of contraindications for a drug are usually provided with it, either in monographs, package inserts (accompanying prescribed medications), or in warning labels (for OTC drugs). CDI/MDI might also be avoided by physicians requiring their patients to return any unused prescriptions. Patients should ask their doctors and pharmacists if there are any interactions between the drugs they are taking.\n\nOn June 30, 2009, an FDA advisory panel recommended that Vicodin and another painkiller, Percocet, be removed from the market because they have allegedly caused over 400 deaths a year. The problem is with paracetamol (acetaminophen/Tylenol for example) overdose and liver damage. These two drugs, in combination with other drugs like Nyquil and Theraflu, can cause death by multiple drug intake and/or drug overdose. Another solution would be to not include paracetamol with Vicodin or Percocet.\n\nMany celebrities have died from CDI/MDI, including:\n\n\nIn February 2007, five months after her son Daniel Wayne Smith was found dead from CDI with methadone, sertraline, and escitalopram in his system, Anna Nicole Smith also died from CDI/MDI. Her two autopsies detected more than 11 drugs in her bloodstream, including chloral hydrate, clonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, diphenhydramine, topiramate, oseltamivir, ciprofloxacin, methocarbamol, carisoprodol and others. The deaths of Daniel Smith and Anna Nicole Smith were declared as Combined Drug Intoxication.\n\nAustralian actor Heath Ledger was found dead on January 22, 2008, in his SoHo, New York City, apartment; the toxicology report concluded that the cause of death was \"acute intoxication\" resulting from \"the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam, and doxylamine\" and \"that the manner of [his] death\" was \"accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications or combined drug intoxication (CDI).\"\n\nSome speedball deaths that are diagnosed as MDI/CDI might simply be drug overdose, which is a related but completely different phenomenon. The following list is for speedball CDI/MDI deaths only. Any combination of uppers and downers can be called a speedball death.\n\n\nThe Right to Die case of then-comatose Karen Ann Quinlan (March 29, 1954 – June 11, 1985) made legal history in 1975 and 1976, stimulating public scrutiny of ethical and moral implications of her case. In 1975, after drinking gin and tonics at a party and then taking Diazepam, Quinlan collapsed, suffered respiratory failure and irreversible brain damage, and, after being taken to the hospital, lapsed into a persistent vegetative state. After she had been kept alive on a ventilator for several months without improvement, her parents requested that the hospital discontinue such active care and allow her to die. The hospital refused, and the subsequent legal battles made newspaper headlines and set significant precedents. After the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled in her parents' favor, Quinlan spent nine more years comatose in the hospital, before dying from pneumonia in 1985.\n\nThe CDI/MDI death of Michael Jackson led to the trial of Conrad Murray, whose license was revoked in four states and who was sentenced to serve four years in a California prison.\n\n"}
{"id": "56223894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56223894", "title": "Commemoration of the American Revolution", "text": "Commemoration of the American Revolution\n\nCommemorations of the American Revolution (1775-1783) have given it a central place in the American memory. As the founding story, it is covered in the schools, memorialized by a national holiday, and commemorated in innumerable monuments. Thus Independence Day (the \"Fourth of July\") is a major national holiday celebrated annually. Besides local sites such as Bunker Hill, one of the first national pilgrimages for memorial tourists was Mount Vernon, George Washington's estate, which attracted ten thousand visitors a year by the 1850s.\n\nEvery nation constructs and honors the memory of its founding, and following generations use it to establish its identity and define patriotism. \nThe memory of the Founding and the Revolution has long been used as a political weapon. For example, the right-wing \"Tea Party movement\" of the 21st century explicitly memorialized the Boston Tea Party as a protest against intrusive government. In the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric. David Ryan, noting that the Bicentennial was celebrated a year after the United States' humiliating 1975 withdrawal from Vietnam, says the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, and presented a nostalgic approach to 1776 that made it seem eternally young and fresh.\n\nThe Revolution became the main source of the non-denominational \"American civil religion\" that has shaped patriotism, and the memory and meaning of the nation's birth ever since. Specific battles are not central (as they are for the Civil War) but rather certain events and people have been celebrated as icons of certain virtues (or vices). The American Revolution is remembered for its Moses-like leader (George Washington), its prophets (Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine), disciples (Alexander Hamilton, James Madison) and martyrs (Boston Massacre, Crispus Attucks, Nathan Hale), as well as its devils (Benedict Arnold), holy sites (Valley Forge, Bunker Hill), rituals (Boston Tea Party), holy symbol (the new flag), sacred holidays (Independence Day), and holy scriptures whose every sentence is carefully studied and applied (The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights).\n\nThere are innumerable monuments or commemorations of the major Founding Fathers, with the names of Washington and Jefferson (and Lincoln) most often selected for buildings, sculptures, postage, and currency. In the 1920s, Washington and Jefferson, together with Theodore Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, were chosen by sculptor Gutzon Borglum and approved by President Calvin Coolidge to be the four American heroes celebrated at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Over the decades the interpretive framework used by the National Park Service to explain this commemoration has changed, with such themes as localism giving way to nationalism, and overpowering gigantic images of Great Men giving way a little to increased attention paid to the ordinary workers who built it. The visit became less a patriotic pilgrimage than a family-oriented tourist event with success measured in terms of attendance at the remote South Dakota site, which reached a million visitors a year in 1959, and passed the two million level in 2005.\n\nToday, more than 100 battlefields and historic sites of the American Revolution are protected and maintained by federal, state and local governments. The National Park Service, a federal agency, alone owns and maintains more than 50 battlefield parks and sites related to the Revolution. On Veteran's Day (November 11) in 2014, the Civil War Trust, the Society of the Cincinnati and other preservation groups announced the creation of \"Campaign 1776,\" an initiative to protect and interpret the battlefields of the American Revolution and the War of 1812. As does the Civil War Trust, \"Campaign 1776\" uses public-private partnerships to provide the funding to acquire battlefield properties. By the end of 2017, \"Campaign 1776\" had acquired more than 675 battlefield acres at 10 battlefields of the Revolutionary War or War of 1812 in six states. On May 8, 2018, the organization became the American Battlefield Trust comprised two divisions, the Civil War Trust and the Revolutionary War Trust.\n\nThe United States Bicentennial was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the American Revolution. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nA Canadian specialist on the Revolutionary era has evaluated the evidence, the accuracy and the historical themes employed by twelve Hollywood films featuring the American Revolution from 1939-2002. She covers the major characters, heroes and villains, Patriots and Loyalists, plots, and social and class themes. She compares cinematic understandings of the Revolution with the interpretations of historians to reveal thematic consistencies, variations, and conceptual gulfs between filmmakers and historians.\n\nThe \"National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution\" (SAR or NSSAR) is a congressionally chartered organization based in Louisville, Kentucky. Its purpose is \"maintaining and extending the institutions of American freedom, an appreciation for true patriotism, a respect for our national symbols, the value of American citizenship, and the unifying force of \"e pluribus unum\" that was created, from the people of many nations, coming together as one nation and one people.\" Sons of the American Revolution is a patriotic organization. Its members are male descendants of people who served in the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), or who contributed to establishing the independence of the United States. The society is dedicated to perpetuating American ideals and traditions, and to protecting the U.S. Constitution. Holidays of commemoration and memorializing for Constitution Day (September 17, 1787), Flag Day (June 14th, 1777), and Bill of Rights Day (December 15, 1791) were established through its efforts. The society was founded on April 30, 1889.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "670072", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=670072", "title": "Committee of Safety (Hawaii)", "text": "Committee of Safety (Hawaii)\n\nThe Committee of Safety, formally the Citizen's Committee of Public Safety, was a 13-member group of the Annexation Club. The group was composed of mostly American citizens who were members of the \"Missionary Party\", as well as foreign residents in the Kingdom of Hawaii that planned and carried out the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve annexation of Hawaii by the United States. The new independent Republic of Hawaii government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President Grover Cleveland, and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. Territory of Hawaii.\n\nThe Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the “Committee of Nine” was formed April 16, 1883, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature. For the following elections of 1886 the committee reconvened, this time calling themselves the “Committee of Thirteen” due to the change in members. Their intent was to make the Independent Party the majority party in the legislature. At the end of the elections the Independents won ten seats, a net loss of three seats.\n\nIn January 1887 the Committee of Thirteen formed a secret society called the Hawaiian League. No official records were kept, but Lorrin A. Thurston (the grandson of American missionaries Asa Thurston and Lorrin Andrews) drafted the group's constitution. The group was headed by an executive committee of lawyers and businessmen mostly of non-aboriginal non-indigenous naturalized United States citizens. Membership grew through the year, including some German and British citizens, and a few part-Hawaiians.\nAlthough the politicians changed the name of their party from \"Missionary\" to \"Reform\", many wanted to become part of the United States, not just reform the monarchy. \nThis was why the Hawaiian League was also called the Annexation Club, although not often in public. \n\nThe Hawaiian League came into control of the Honolulu Rifles. Made of about 200 armed local (non-native) men, who fought under the command of enthusiastic annexationist Volney V. Ashford.\nIn June 1887, the Hawaiian League used the Rifles to force King Kalākaua to enact the Bayonet Constitution which limited his power. \nAfter Queen Liliuokalani came to power in 1891, she attempted to restore power to the throne. This caused the group to act again.\n\nThe precipitating event leading to the overthrow was the attempt by Queen Liliuokalani to promulgate a new constitution which would have strengthened the power of the monarch relative to the legislature in which Euro-American business elites held disproportionate power, a political situation that was a direct result of the 1887 constitution. The conspirators' stated goals were to depose the queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.\n\nOn January 16, the Marshal of the Kingdom Charles B. Wilson was tipped off to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested warrants to arrest the 13-member Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under martial law. Because the members had strong political ties with United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, the requests were repeatedly denied, fearing if approved, the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston, Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and Captain of the Royal Household Guard, Samuel Nowlein, had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the Queen.\n\nThe Revolution ignited on January 17 when a policeman was shot and wounded while trying to stop a wagon carrying weapons to the Honolulu Rifles. The Committee of Safety feared the shooting would bring government forces to rout out the conspirators and stop the coup before it could begin. The Rifles garrisoned Ali'iolani Hale across the street from ʻIolani Palace and waited for the queen’s response. \n\nAs these events were unfolding, the Committee of Safety expressed concern for the safety and property of American residents in Honolulu. United States Government Minister John L. Stevens, advised about these supposed threats to non-combatant American lives and property by the Committee of Safety, obliged their request and summoned a company of uniformed U.S. Marines from the and two companies of U.S. sailors to land on the Kingdom and take up positions at the U.S. Legation, Consulate, and Arion Hall on the afternoon of January 16, 1893. 162 sailors and Marines aboard the USS \"Boston\" in Honolulu Harbor came ashore well-armed but under orders of neutrality. The sailors and Marines did not enter the Palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served to intimidate royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, \"the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.\" Due to the Queen's desire \"to avoid any collision of armed forces, and perhaps the loss of life\" for her subjects and after some deliberation, at the urging of advisers and friends, the Queen ordered her forces to surrender. The Honolulu Rifles took over government buildings, disarmed the Royal Guard, and declared a Provisional Government.\n\nThe Committee of Safety issued the following proclamation, read aloud on January 17 by its Chairman Henry E. Cooper to a large crowd assembled in front of the royal residence Iolani Palace:\n\"First - The Hawaiian monarchial system of government is hereby abrogated.\n\nSecond - A Provisional Government for the control and management of public affairs and the protection of public peace is hereby established, to exist until terms of union with the United States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon\".\n\nThe Hawaiian League unofficially adopted the American Flag to appeal to the US and promote annexation. The flag was raised over ʻIolani Palace by Stevens on January 17, 1893. The flag was eventually lowered by James H. Blount that April for spreading a false presumption that the US had taken control.\n\nDuring the overthrow, the Japanese Imperial Navy gunboat \"Naniwa\" was docked at Pearl Harbor. The gunboat's commander, Heihachiro Togo, who later commanded the Japanese battleship fleet at Tsushima, refused to accede to the Provisional Government's demands that he strike the colors of the Kingdom, but later lowered the colors on order of the Japanese Government. Along with every other international legations in Honolulu, the Japanese Consulate-General, Suburo Fujii, quickly recognized the Provisional Government as the legitimate successor to the monarchy.\n\nEvery government with a diplomatic presence in Hawaii recognized the Provisional Government within 48 hours of the overthrow, including the United States, although the recognition by the United States government and its further response is detailed in the section above on \"American Response\". Countries recognizing the new Provisional Government included Chile, Austria-Hungary, Mexico, Russia, the Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Japan, Italy, Portugal, Great Britain, Denmark, Belgium, China, Peru, and France. When the Republic of Hawaii was declared on July 4, 1894, immediate recognition was given by every nation with diplomatic relations with Hawaii, except for Britain, whose response came in November 1894.\n\n\n\nSix Hawaiian subjects, five American citizens, a German subject, and a British subject signed the January 16 letter:\n\n\nOthers who assisted in the overthrow:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2045191", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2045191", "title": "DECUS", "text": "DECUS\n\nThe Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society (DECUS) was an independent computer user group related to Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC).\n\nThe Connect User Group Community, formed from the consolidation in May, 2008 of DECUS, Encompass, HP-Interex, and ITUG is the Hewlett-Packard’s largest user community representing more than 50,000 participants.\n\nDECUS was the Digital Equipment Computer Users' Society, a users' group for Digital Equipment Corporation computers. Members included companies and organizations who purchased DEC equipment; many members were application programmers who wrote code for DEC machines or system programmers who managed DEC systems. DECUS was founded in March 1961 by Edward Fredkin.\n\nDECUS was legally a part of Digital Equipment Corporation and subsidized by it; however, it was run by volunteers. Digital staff members were not eligible to join DECUS, yet were allowed and encouraged to participate in DECUS activities. Digital, in turn, relied on DECUS as an important channel of communication with its customers.\n\nDECUS had a software library which accepted orders from anyone, distributing programs submitted to it by people willing to share. It was organized by processor and operating system, using information submitted by program submitters, who signed releases allowing this and asserting their right to do so. The DECUS library published catalogs of these offerings yearly, though because it had the catalog mastered by an outside firm, it did not have easy ways to retrieve the content of early catalogs (prior to circa 1980) in machine readable format. Later material was maintained in house and was more easily edited. The charges for copying were somewhat high, reflecting the fact the copies were made by hand on DECUS equipment.\n\nThere were two DECUS US symposia per year, in which members and DEC employees gave presentation, and could visit an exhibit hall containing many new computer models and peripherals among other things. By grace of the DEC employees, it became a custom to allow users to copy media for one another on these machines. This activity grew with time, and in the spring of 1977 some volunteers from the RSX SIG (Special Interest Group) led by Phil Cannon, Jim Neeland, and several others, arranged an informal drop-off, and made master distributions of all material submitted. Then they and other volunteers essentially made copies of this master distribution on\ntapes for the rest of the symposium, for anyone with a blank tape to write on. This very quickly grew, getting noted in LUG (local user group) and SIG (special interest group) newsletters, and the process of creating a master quickly attracted others who would make a master index of whatever had been submitted. The process of physically creating master tapes remained much the same until around 1979 when the tapecopy coordinators arranged copying facilities somewhere near the symposium site, as 9 track tape drives were not appearing as much on the exhibit hall floor enough to rely on by then. By fall 1979, there was a release form used with submissions, so that the DECUS library could distribute the combined tapes, making them more easily available to those who did not get to the symposia. The VAX/VMS SIG started producing SIG tapes in spring 1979 and other SIGs, notably RSTS, RT-11, Languages and Tools, and the 10/20 SIGs, had analogous distributions made in somewhat similar fashion. The distribution by copying only at the symposium was seen to be inadequate, so a tree of people, each of whom would receive a copy of the material and make copies for others, was devised. In these cases the person desiring the material was expected to furnish blank media, as no money ever changed hands. The tapes grew in size constantly, and eventually moved to 8mm Exabyte media and to CDs, and then to DVDs. By that time nobody worried much about the cost of blanks. The RSX SIG tapes continued until 1992, when material was drying up. Some RSX material was put on VMS SIG tapes after that, and around 1987 the Languages and Tools sig tapes merged in. The distributions continued to be released twice a year until 2005, and were released yearly in 2006 and 2007 when the tapecopy coordinator who had been making masters since the mid 1980s, Glenn Everhart, passed the material on. By that time, network distribution had become good enough that media copy was no longer necessary in most places.\n\nThe DECUS U.S. Chapter conducted technical conferences at various locations, and ran other operations like Local User Groups (LUGs) and Special Interest Groups. Chapters in other nations did likewise. DECUS also promoted the open exchange of user-developed software, largely via magnetic tape.\n\nDECUS played a critical role in the development of computer games in North America in the 1970s. The pioneering titles \"Adventure\" by Will Crowther; \"Baseball\", \"Dungeon\" and \"Star Trek\" by Don Daglow and \"Hunt the Wumpus\" by Gregory Yob provided a foundation for the games industry. One of the first real-time interactive multi-user games, \"MTrek\" (MultiTrek), was also distributed on DECUS tapes. Major commercial game titles including \"Zork\" and \"Empire\" were first popularized by DECUS.\n\nIn the 1990s, DECUS played a significant role in integration of isolated post-Soviet scientific, technology and business communities into worldwide community.\n\nIn 1998, Compaq acquired Digital, and DECUS became a Compaq user group.\n\nIn 2000, the DECUS U.S. Chapter incorporated as the independent user group Encompass.\n\nIn 2002, Hewlett-Packard acquired Compaq, and DECUS became an HP User Society.\n\nIn 2008, the HP user communities Encompass, ITUG and HP Interex EMEA consolidated to form Connect Worldwide.\n\nMembership was organized by country. Each chapter acted as part of the worldwide Association of Hewlett-Packard User Groups. DECUS had some 7,500 members, mostly system, network, and applications specialists as well as IT Managers.\n\nAssociation activities: The HP User Society DECUS promoted the exchange of information and know-how between its members, manufacturers and partners. The association supported its members in the representation of their interests against HP and partners, helped in problem solving and facilitates formation of opinion and advanced training by organizing events.\n\nSome early and well-known members of DECUS were the late Terry Shannon and John R. Wisniewski.\n\n\n"}

A local coordinator with the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) confirmed the death toll.\n\nNEMA spokesperson Yushau Shuaibu said that the Madalla bombing occurred on the street outside the church. He added that the church, which can hold 1,000 people, was badly affected by the blast. Witnesses said that the windows of nearby houses were shattered by the explosion. Officials at the local hospital said that the condition of many injured people was serious. Slaku Luguard, a NEMA coordinator, said that rescue workers found at least 25 bodies and officials were tallying the wounded in various hospitals. NEMA acknowledged that it did not have enough ambulances to help the wounded. Luguard also said that an angry crowd, which gathered at the blast site, blocked emergency workers from getting inside: \"We're trying to calm the situation. There are some angry people around trying to cause problems,\" he said.\n\nAn explosion hit the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Church in Jos and gunmen later fired on police who were guarding the area resulting in the death of one police officer.\n\nAnother two bombs were found in a nearby building and were disarmed.\n\nTwo explosions were reported in the city of Damaturu and another at a church in the northeastern town of Gadaka. At least one of the attacks in Damaturu was the work of a suicide car bomber, who rammed the building housing the headquarters of the State Security Service. At least three people were killed in that blast; a senior military commander allegedly targeted by it survived.\n\nThe attacks were claimed by the Islamist group Boko Haram.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

However, in Pacific Grove's version of the story, the fleeing couple turns into monarch butterflies (because Pacific Grove likes to be known as \"Butterfly Town, USA\"), as opposed to birds, to flee the evil mandarin.\n\nSome type of Japanese/Chinese boat parade with lanterns did occur sometime between 1875 until 1905 with roots in the Chautauqua's Illumination Night first practiced at the original Chautauqua, New York however, currently there is no written scholarship to refer.\n\nThe Feast of Lanterns was originally developed in 1905 to spark interest in the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle. Participation in the program had diminished, and organizers felt that a large closing ceremony would reinvigorate engagement with the CLSC. The festival happened annually until 1917, and then only intermittently until 1958, when the Pacific Grove City Council revived the event.\n\nThe Feast of Lanterns play is performed on the Saturday of the last full weekend of every July, and the small town of Pacific Grove crams onto Lover's Point Beach to watch the show. In support of the town-wide holiday, lanterns can be seen hanging on the porches of many local homes. Lantern soup and lantern pie are delicious delicacies to be found exclusively at the \"Feast of Lanterns.\" The afternoon preceding the Feast of Lanterns, the city holds its annual Pet Parade, which circles its main street, Lighthouse Avenue.\n\nThe Feast of Lanterns holiday ends with propelled fireworks as well as unique Chinese board fireworks and lit Torei gates over Lover's Point Beach, with Queen Topaz and her peasant lover, Chang, escaping safely together.\n\nThe Royal Court of Feast of Lanterns Princesses is a group of 4-9 high school aged girls and boys who are citizens of Pacific Grove.The number of Princesses there are depends on how many apply. Each princess is a different gem (i.e., Princess Pearl, Princess Tourmaline, Princess Turquoise, etc.), and they are led by the Feast of Lanterns Queen, who is known as Queen Topaz. Queen Topaz is the star of the annual skit. The boys, which have been recently allowed to participate, pose as male faux Chinese assistants or as the young character Chang in the play. The Royal Court spends their entire month of July establishing themselves in the community, visiting retirement homes, preschools, and other events while giving out their personal signed trading cards.\n\n"}

{"id": "28082925", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28082925", "title": "Fixated Threat Assessment Centre", "text": "Fixated Threat Assessment Centre\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre (FTAC) is a joint police/mental health unit set up in October 2006 by the Home Office, the Department of Health and Metropolitan Police Service to assess and manage the risk to politicians, members of the British Royal Family, and other public figures from obsessive individuals.\n\nThe rationale for a joint police/mental health unit was the finding that the main danger of death or serious injury to politicians in Western Europe came from attacks by people suffering from a mental health illness, who had given warnings of what they might do in the form of inappropriate, harassing or threatening communications or approaches towards the politicians in question. A similar picture was found in a study of historical attacks on the British royal family. A separate detailed study of recent inappropriate communications and approaches to members of the royal family found that 83% of the individuals concerned were suffering from psychosis. \n\nSimilar findings have come from the United States, where Park Dietz has written: “Every instance of an attack on a public figure by a lone stranger in the United States for which adequate information has been made publicly available has been the work of a mentally disordered person who issued one or more pre-attack signals in the form of inappropriate letters, visits or statements...\" The role of FTAC in the UK is to detect such signals, to evaluate the risks involved and to intervene to reduce them. Such intervention often entails the obtaining of treatment and care for the fixated individual from psychiatric and social services and general practitioners in their town of residence.\n\nThe word ‘fixated’ in the name of the unit indicates that the main motivational drives behind the stalking of public figures are pathologically intense fixations on individuals or causes, these being obsessive pre-occupations pursued to an abnormally intense degree. In the case of those pursuing the Royal Family, these fixations divide between beliefs that the individual was a member of the family or married to a member of the family; that the royal personage was involved in plots to persecute them; and that the Royal Family were culpable for failing to redress a particular grievance, often delusional, with which the individual was angrily obsessed.\n\nFTAC is staffed by ten police officers from the Metropolitan Police Service, three full-time senior forensic nurses, a full-time senior social worker and a number of senior forensic psychiatrists and psychologists from the Barnet Enfield and Haringey NHS Trust and the Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust. FTAC receives around 1,000 referrals a year of people who have engaged in threatening or harassing communications towards politicians or the Royal Family. Around half are assessed as being of low risk after initial enquiries. The remainder are investigated by FTAC staff. They may then be referred to local health services for further assessment and potential involuntary commitment. In some cases, they may be detained by police under the section 136 powers of the Mental Health Act 1983 prior to referral.\n\nAlthough run by London's Metropolitan Police Service, FTAC is responsible for dealing nationally with the stalking or harassment of public figures by lone individuals. According to its founder, David James, it attempts not only to provide protection for the subjects of obsessive attention, but also to help people with obsessions who have mental illnesses that might otherwise have gone undiagnosed or untreated. The basis of the approach arises from the fact that the majority of the fixated are driven by delusional beliefs based in potentially treatable mental disorders. Treating those with evident mental illness will have an important effect in reducing the level of risk to public figures, whilst at the same time improving the health and welfare of the individuals concerned. The strap-line on FTAC's stationery is 'Preventing Harm and Facilitating Care'.\n\nAccording to a statement made in June 2007 by the then Minister of State for the Home Office Tony McNulty,\n\n\"FTAC does not detain people in psychiatric hospitals. When it encounters an individual in need of mental health care it alerts their general practitioners and psychiatrists, who then provide appropriate help under existing legislation. FTAC may make use of police powers under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 to take a person who appears to be suffering from mental disorder, and in immediate need of care or control, to a place of safety. When people are removed to hospital under section 136, they are examined by a registered medical practitioner and interviewed by an approved social worker, not associated with FTAC, in order to make any necessary arrangements for their treatment or care.\"\n\nIn a parliamentary reply made in June 2009, the Secretary of State for the Home Office David Hanson said: \"Since 2006, when FTAC began operation, 246 people have been detained under the Mental Health Act following a referral from FTAC and a subsequent decision by local health services. No individual has received a custodial sentence as a result of FTAC involvement.\"\n\nHe also stated that during that same period, 27 people had been conveyed to a \"place of safety\" by FTAC staff under section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983.\n\nFTAC published the details of its interventions in its first 100 cases in the \"Journal of Forensic Psychiatry & Psychology\" in 2010. Eighty-six per cent of those assessed by FTAC were diagnosed as suffering from psychotic illness; 57% of the sample group were subsequently admitted to hospital, and 26% treated in the community. In 80% of cases, the risk level was reduced to low by FTAC intervention, the remainder of cases remaining under continued FTAC management\n\nIn protection terms, FTAC’s activities are said to benefit the families of the fixated individuals and the general public as much as the public figures that they are hounding. This is because those close to the fixated are more regularly exposed to their irrational and threatening behaviour than the public figures they target. This finding is similar to that made in the USA by Dietz and Martell in a report prepared for the National Institute of Justice: “The persons most at risk of violence from the individual mentally ill person who pursues public figures are not the public figures or those that protect them – assuming they have the necessary security arrangements - but rather the private citizens who are the family members and neighbours of the mentally disordered subject.”\n\nThe setting up of FTAC was the main recommendation of the report of Fixated Research Group (FRG) which undertook a major research project on behalf of the Home Office between 2003 and 2006. This looked at inappropriate communications and approaches to members of the Royal Family, and systematically examined 8,000 files held by SO14, the royalty protection division of the Metropolitan Police Service’s Protection Command.\nThe Fixated Research Group was composed of forensic psychiatrists and psychologists from the UK, Australia and the USA, who are experts in the field of stalking. They included Paul Mullen and Michele Pathé from Australia, co-authors of ‘Stalkers and their Victims’, and J. Reid Meloy from San Diego, editor of \"The Psychology of Stalking\". The series of research papers published by the group in peer-reviewed scientific journals forms the evidence base for the Fixated Threat Assessment Centre.\n\nThe researchers at FTAC contend that the joint police-NHS model has other possible applications within the UK, such as in police responses to stalking of ordinary people and in homicide prevention. In their view, a logical further development would be the modification of the role of NHS police-liaison psychiatric nurses, so that they become embedded in police responses at borough or county level in order to perform an enabling role, to the benefit of individual patients and of public protection.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47088719", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47088719", "title": "Greek bailout referendum, 2015", "text": "Greek bailout referendum, 2015\n\nA referendum to decide whether Greece was to accept the bailout conditions in the country's government-debt crisis proposed jointly by the European Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the European Central Bank (ECB) on 25 June 2015, took place on 5 July 2015. The referendum was announced by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in the early morning of 27 June 2015, and ratified the following day by the Parliament and the President. It was the first referendum to be held since the republic referendum of 1974, and the only one in modern Greek history not to concern the form of government.\n\nAs a result of the referendum, the bailout conditions were rejected by a majority of over 61% to 39% approving, with the \"No\" vote winning in all of Greece's regions. The referendum results also forced the immediate resignation of New Democracy leader Antonis Samaras as party president because of the perceived negative result of the \"Yes\" choice, to which the conservative party and Samaras had committed themselves. Although winning the referendum, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis also resigned and was replaced on 6 July by Euclid Tsakalotos.\n\nDespite the result of the referendum, on 13 July 2015 the government of Tsipras reached an agreement with the European authorities for a 3-year-bailout with even harsher austerity conditions as the ones rejected by the voters. This represented a \"drastic turnaround\" for Prime Minister Tsipras position, as he had been elected in an anti-austerity platform. Former Finance Minister Varoufakis characterised the harshness of the deal as a new Treaty of Versailles and \"Greece’s Terms of Surrender\". In July and August, Tsipras was able to get the new austerity packages and the entire bailout agreement approved by the Parliament, but had to relly in the pro-European Union opposition parties as around 40 MPs of the major ruling party abstained or voted against the measures. This triggered the September 2015 snap election, where Tsipras was re-elected albeit with an historical low turnout. The second Tsipras government was thus marked by an intense austerity policy in the context of the third bailout to Greece. The country left bailout in August 2018, though austerity policies continued after that due to pressure from European Union and IMF.\n\nThe referendum was announced by Tsipras in the early morning of 27 June 2015. No prior notice of the decision was given to the Eurogroup. In the early hours of 28 June 2015, Parliament voted on whether or not the government's proposed bailout referendum should be held, with 178 MPs (Syriza, ANEL and Golden Dawn) for, 120 MPs (all other parties) against and two MPs abstaining.\n\nVoters were asked whether they approve of the proposal made to Greece by the Juncker Commission, the IMF and the ECB during the Eurogroup meeting on 25 June. This proposal with a list of \"10 prior action items\" was published by the commission, but withdrawn when negotiations were abandoned shortly after.\nThe Greek government thus asked to vote on two previous documents, titled \"Reforms For The Completion Of The Current Program And Beyond\" and \"Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis.\". The possible answers were stated as \"Not approved/No\" and \"Approved/Yes\".\n\nEvangelos Venizelos from PASOK party, as well as the To Potami and New Democracy parties, said that the proposed referendum would be unconstitutional, as the constitution does not allow for referendums on fiscal matters. Article 44, section 2 provides for two referendum procedures, one for 'crucial national matters' (first clause) and a second for 'Bills passed by Parliament regulating important social matters, with the exception of the fiscal ones' (second clause). The Syriza-led government argued the referendum was in accordance with the first clause, and therefore not unconstitutional.\n\nThe Athens Bar Association (DPS), which is the largest legal association in Greece, raised a range of concerns about whether the referendum law approved by the Hellenic Parliament and President of Greece was legal. They said the call of referendum and the referendum question itself, featured \"\"significant problems on the validity and meaning of voting \"yes\"/\"no\" in that referendum\"\", in a situation where the result of such referendum could have major importance for the future of Greece. Procedural guarantees for calling referendums provided for by law 4023/2011, as well as Constitutional requirements (Article 44, sections 2 and 3) regarding which issues could be put to a referendum, were assessed not to have been met.\n\nOn July 1, Bloomberg reported they had found a translation mistake in the Greek version of the \"Preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis\" part of the Institutions \"unified proposal\" being put to referendum. In this part there were three debt sustainability scenarios, and under the first two the original English document concludes that \"this gross financing need metric points to no sustainability issues\" (Bloomberg's wording for the conclusion was \"that there are no sustainability issues\") when the country's financing needs are taken into account, while the official Greek translation published to Greek voters and sent to reporters on 29 June, was missing the word \"no\", so that the Greek text reads \"there are sustainability issues\". This finding stressed the importance of the second concern raised by DPS, about the referendum putting \"a pair of uncertified documents\" to a vote, instead of what the law required, \"a pair of certified translated documents approved by the initial issuer of the documents\".\n\nGreece's top administrative court, the Council of State, ruled on the legality of the referendum two days before it was due to be held against a claim that was submitted by private individuals and argued that the referendum could be violating the country's constitution by posing a question regarding \"public finances\". The court's decision was that the referendum was within the jurisdiction of the government and that the court had no authority on the issue, thus rejecting the claim.\n\nThe President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, said on 29 June during a press conference on Greece that \"the momentum [for finding an agreement] was destroyed unilaterally by the announcement of a referendum and by the decision to mount a 'no' campaign to reject this agreement\".\n\nThe European Commission further objected to the timing of the referendum, stressing it should have been held to allow sufficient time before 30 June 2015 deadline when the \"20 February 2015 offer ratified by other national parliaments\"—in which Greece had been offered the prospect of completing and extending its existing bailout agreement by a new (yet to be mutually agreed) set of renegotiated terms—expired. The Commission also objected to the approach of not choosing a referendum question reflecting the entire dimensions of the comprehensive bailout offer, which was not only about implementation of a \"reform programme\", but also included a €35bn investment package which it said would spur job creation along with economic growth, and included a guarantee for debt relief according to a renewal of the \"November 2012 debt relief statement\". This would ensure—conditional on the completion of the second bailout programme under its new renegotiated terms—automatic debt relief, to the extent that the Greek debt-to-GDP ratio would be reduced to levels below 124% in 2020 and 110% in 2022.\n\nThe European Commission also found it strange and inappropriate, that the Greek government asked for voters' opinion on the \"Institution's 25 June compromise proposal\" rather than the latest \"Institution's 26 June compromise proposal\". It said the latest \"26 June compromise proposal\" differed from the \"25 June version\" on several points (meeting objections tabled by the Greek government), of which one of the most significant was that the VAT rate for hotels had been reduced from 23% to 13%.\n\nThe European Commission claimed that neither of the Institution's proposals, contrary to claims by the Greek government, had contained \"excessive austerity\", public wage cuts or pension cuts. Instead they had lowered their demand for a public budget primary surplus from the previously required 4.5%—now to be 1% in 2015 followed by a gradual increase to a level of 3.5% for 2018 and beyond—saving Greece from implementing €12bn of extra austerity measures. Their request for a \"wage reform\", it said, was about conducting an ILO approved review and update of the current collective bargaining rights in the private sector (not removal of collective bargaining rights)—and implementation of a new approved wage scheme in which public workers were paid in future according to qualifications and performance (instead of clientele deals). Their \"pension reform\", it said, was calling for the cancellation of incentives for early retirement, along with moving to a system in which all people in Greece received pensions on the same terms (not treating some sectors more beneficially than others).\n\nThe claim by Juncker that there were no pension cuts in the proposal raised eyebrows, with \"Financial Times\" journalist Peter Spiegel tweeting that it was \"simply not true\".\n\nOther important elements of the proposals, the European Commission said, were: to implement a more efficient and independent Tax Collection Authority, opening up closed professions to competition (i.e. so that the Greek price for electricity—which is currently the most expensive in EU—would decline), and to implement a string of measures to ensure more social fairness (guaranteed minimum income scheme, making tax payments more proportionate to income, targeting extra saving cuts in public spending on areas with no adverse impact for average citizens—i.e. increased defense cuts, removing socially unjust favorable tax treatments of ship-owners, fighting corruption in which the focus should be \"big fish\" rather than \"ordinary people\", and safeguarding a lasting social fairness by supporting more transparency and efficiency in public administration—in particularly through establishment of a new politically-independent tax administration).\n\nFurther, the European Commission signaled that the referendum question, to which they would recommend a \"Yes\", from its viewpoint should be understood as whether or not Greece wanted to remain part of Europe and the Eurozone, which at the present state included acceptance of receiving conditional bailout help on a set of mutually negotiated and agreed terms. The Commission claimed the biggest impediment to jobs, growth and investment at the moment in Greece, was not the contents of the Institution's bailout proposals, but instead a paralyzing uncertainty caused by the Greek government's decision to cut itself off from continued bailout support and a moratorium on implementing structural reforms. According to the Commission, this uncertainty and standstill could only be removed if Greece at the negotiating table agreed on one of the latest compromise proposals which the Institutions had tabled after accommodating a range of objections and requests tabled by the Greek government. They claimed the confidence effect of voting \"Yes\" to the settlement of such a deal, the predictability it would bring, together with the injection of liquidity into the economy from disbursements, would restore job creation and growth to the benefit of Greece.\n\nThe Council of Europe stated that the Greek referendum does not meet European standards, as voters were not given a two-week period to make up their minds, as non-binding guidelines recommend. Due to the hasty schedule, the Council of Europe was not able to send election observers and the Greek government had not requested them either. However the head of the Greek delegation and vice president of the Council's parliamentary assembly, Dimitris Vitsas, denied that there was any decision made by the Council of Europe and said that it was only a personal opinion expressed by the Council's general secretary, Thorbjørn Jagland, with Tiny Kox, the head of the Left wing in the Council's assembly supporting the same view and asking the general secretary to clarify his previous announcement.\n\nThe United Nations Independent Expert on the Promotion of a Democratic and Equitable International Order and on human rights and international law, Alfred de Zayas and Virginia Dandan respectively, welcomed the Greek referendum and called for international solidarity, while expressing disappointment that the IMF and the EU have failed to reach a non austerity based solution yet, and supporting that \"no treaty or loan agreement can force a country to violate the civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights of its population, nor can a loan agreement negate the sovereignty of a State\".\n\nThere has been substantial disagreement between campaigns on the implications of the referendum, and the public has interpreted it in a variety of ways. Tsipras has argued that a \"No\" vote would represent a rejection of the austerity terms demanded by the creditors, and strengthen the Greek negotiating position. Tsipras declared \"On Sunday, we are not simply deciding to remain in Europe -- we are deciding to live with dignity in Europe\". Tsipras has repeatedly rejected Greek and international warnings that a \"No\" vote would be perceived by Greek's main creditors as a \"No\" to reforms in Greece, and a \"No\" to remaining in the Eurozone. Advocates of a \"Yes\" vote, among them a grassroot movement entitled Menoume Europi (Stay in Europe) have cast the referendum as a decision on Greece remaining in the eurozone, and perhaps even the European Union.\n\nMany international leaders as well as mainstream economists and media warned that if the \"No\" vote leads to a failure to secure continued bailout support for Greece in due time, this would likely lead to a broader Greek sovereign default, a haircut on Greek bank deposits, a collapse of the banking sector, followed by an aggravated depression of the Greek economy, and a Greek exit from the euro area. A new local currency to replace the euro would be strongly devalued, which would decrease the purchasing power for Greeks and lead to inflation.\n\nEurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said that \"in case of a 'No', Greece's (financial) situation will become exceptionally difficult... The economic problems will be even bigger and an aid programme more difficult to implement\". European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said Greece's negotiating position would be \"dramatically weakened\" if a 'No' won. Other European leaders have also criticized the Greek government's representation of the referendum options, with EU leaders saying that they would see a \"No\" vote as a rejection of Europe.\n\nPublic opinion strongly favours keeping the euro. Of all the political parties which won seats in the parliamentary election in May, only the Communist KKE expressed support for leaving the euro, and indeed for leaving the European Union.\n\nA majority of European leaders, and the US President Obama have expressed the opinion that Greece should remain in the monetary union. An opposite view comes from the UK Prime Minister David Cameron who mentioned, according to a leaked note, that it \"might be better\" for Greece to leave the euro in order to sort its economy out, even though Cameron conceded that there were major risks in that, too.\n\nReception by professional/societal associations in Greece:\n\nIn his initial address, when prime minister Tsipras of the ruling Syriza party announced the plebiscite on 5 July, he recommended a \"No\" vote to the Greek people. Most other Syriza members also supported a \"No\" vote.\n\nANEL, the other ruling party in coalition with Syriza, announced that they were campaigning for a \"No\" vote. The far-right Golden Dawn party, not being in the government, also called for a \"No\" vote.\n\nNew Democracy, To Potami and PASOK parties campaigned for a \"Yes\" vote.\n\nKKE declared it was against both of the latest two versions of the cash-for-reform counter proposals being submitted to the negotiation table between Greece and its public creditors (the counter proposal of the Greek government, and the latest compromise counter proposal of the institutions), and said that it would try to change the question of the referendum, so that people can vote not only against the latest compromise counter-proposal of the Institutions but also against the latest counter-proposal of the Greek government.\n\nKeynesian economists like James K. Galbraith and Thomas Piketty, along with Nobel prize in Economics recipients Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, individually expressed their support for the \"No\" vote on the referendum, arguing that the current austerity programme is a bad option from an economic point of view.\n\nAccording to opinion polls, since the imposition of capital controls in Greece as a result of the ECB's decision not to enlarge its Emergency Liquidity Assistance programme in Greece, there was a trend from a clear No-vote majority to a head-to-head race, or even a slight advantage for the Yes-vote, to accept the proposed bailout terms (as of 3 July 2015).\n\nPoll results listed in the table below are in reverse chronological order and use the date the survey's fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. If that date is unknown, the date of publication is given. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading option's colour. In the instance of a tie no figure is shaded.\n\n\"Note: This section only covers confirmed polls conducted since the announcement of the referendum. Polls not confirmed by their respective pollsters are not shown in the table.\"\n\nTwo opinion polls were conducted shortly before the announcement of the referendum on 27 June, and prior to the referendum question being made public. The first asked how people would vote if a debt-deal were put to a referendum, and the second whether people supported reaching an agreement with the creditor institutions or not. Both found support for a deal in principle.\n\nThe \"NO\" (ΟΧΙ in Greek) vote won in all the regions of Greece, as well as in all the Greek constituencies. The highest share of \"NO\" votes was in Crete, particularly in the constituencies of Heraklion and Chania. The highest share of \"YES\" (ΝΑΙ in Greek) votes was in the Peloponnese region – most notably in the Laconia constituency – although the number of \"YES\" votes were outnumbered by \"NO\" votes.\n\nThree days following the \"no\" vote of the referendum, the Athens government \"formally asked for a three-year bailout from the eurozone’s rescue fund [on 8 July 2015] and pledged to start implementing some economic-policy overhauls\" beginning by mid-July 2015. European finance leaders scheduled a \"crisis summit\" on 12 July to consider the request. The Greek request includes a \"drastic turnaround\" for Prime Minister Tsipras regarding \"pension cuts, tax increases and other austerity measures.\"\nThe total amount of loans requested in the Greek proposal is 53.5 billion euros (). The Greek parliament approved the Prime Minister's request on Friday, 10 July, and the completed package was forwarded to the eurogroup in advance of Sunday's meeting. On Monday, 13 July, the Syriza-led government of Greece accepted a bailout package that contains larger pension cuts and tax increases than the one rejected by Greek voters in the referendum.\n\n"}

A deep extratropical cyclone located just off the shore of Florida led to significant beach erosion and the grounding of the freighter \"Mercedes I\" for several months along the coastal town of Palm Beach. It formed unusually early, and its effects were seen unusually far south into Florida.\n\nWhen a cyclone aloft cut off from the main band of the Westerlies, it spurred cyclogenesis in the Florida Straits by November 22, which led to a nor'easter at an unusually southern latitude near the Bahamas. The surface cyclone slowly traveled through the Florida Straits up the Gulf Stream between Florida and the Bahamas before drifting back out to sea. The storm attempted to gain some central convection during several periods of its life cycle. It was at its most intense on November 23 and November 24, with a central pressure near 1005 hPa. The cyclone moved far enough to the east to allow winds and seas to subside on November 26. There is some evidence that it may have become a subtropical cyclone around November 28, while located in the vicinity of Bermuda. This is why the system is considered the 19th tropical depression of the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nSignificant rainfall was recorded along the Palm Beach County coast between November 21 and November 26 during this event, with local amounts of up to measured at West Palm Beach, Florida. Surface temperatures hovered in the middle 50s°F, or around 13°C, within the main region of impact. However, wind and high seas were the storm's main impact due to the strong pressure gradient between the cyclone's center and a 1040 hPa surface high over the Ohio Valley. Winds as high as with swells of up to were reported by ships in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Along the Atlantic coast, winds reached at Vero Beach, at Melbourne, at Titusville, and at Cocoa Beach. Offshore the Atlantic coast, seas also reached . Coastal erosion took its toll between St. Augustine and Palm Beach during the three-day storm, which eventually subsided on November 26. About five-sixths of a new pier at St. Augustine was destroyed. Erosion from this cyclone would be the worst experienced in southern Brevard County until Hurricane Frances in 2004.\n\nThe storm dragged the 197-foot Venezuelan freighter \"Mercedes I\" ashore the coast of Palm Beach and through a seawall, where it remained in a socialite's backyard into early 1985. Once hauled out to sea, the vessel was sunk and became an artificial coral reef off Fort Lauderdale on March 30, 1985. A second freighter ran aground offshore Jacksonville. Damage from Vero Beach alone totalled US$3.4 million (1984 dollars). Martin County reported an addition US$4 million in losses (1984 dollars). One person perished.\n\nThe top three deadliest tornado outbreaks in the state's history occurred with extratropical cyclones in February 1998, March 1962, and April 1966. In 1989, a December cyclone spun up offshore northeast Florida, bringing measureable snow to Jacksonville and flurries across Sarasota in west-central Florida, and some Lake Okeechobee-effect snows downwind of the lake.\nIn 1993, the Storm of the Century brought an intense squall line, and winds gusting over , to much of the Sunshine State during the early morning hours of March 13. Later that day, flurries were witnessed across the Florida Panhandle in its wake. A frontal wave which became a powerful Christmas 1994 Nor'easter moved across Florida, bringing windy and rainy conditions to the state.\n\n\n"}

It is celebrated as Guernsey and Jersey's national day.\n\nOn 9 May 1945, HMS \"Bulldog\" arrived in St Peter Port, Guernsey, and the German forces surrendered unconditionally aboard the vessel at dawn. British forces landed in St Peter Port shortly afterwards, greeted by crowds of joyous but malnourished islanders singing, amongst other patriotic songs, \"Sarnia-Cherie\".\n\nThe same day, , which had set out from Plymouth, arrived in Jersey to accept the surrender of the occupying forces there. Two naval officers, Surgeon Lieutenant Ronald McDonald and Sub Lieutenant R Milne, were met by the Harbour Master, who escorted them to his office where they together hoisted the Union Flag, before also raising it on the flagstaff of the Pomme D'Or Hotel. This has been re-enacted every year on Liberation Day since 1995. From 2003 to 2011 Harbour Master and Jerseyman Captain Howard Le Cornu performed this annually. His father, John E. Le Cornu, and uncle, David M. Le Cornu, had been in the crowds and had witnessed the occasion on 9 May 1945.\n\nSark was liberated on 10 May 1945, and the German troops in Alderney surrendered on 16 May 1945.\n\nThe Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 1952 established Liberation Day as a public holiday if it fell on a weekday. The Public Holidays and Bank Holidays (Jersey) Act 2010 further laid down that Liberation was also to be a public holiday if it falls on a Saturday. It is not a public holiday, and no day off in lieu is provided, if it falls on a Sunday.\n\nSince the 50th anniversary of Liberation in 1995, a pattern of official ceremonies has developed based in and around Liberation Square in Saint Helier where the events at the Harbour Master's Office and Pomme D'Or Hotel occurred in 1945. Following a special sitting of the States of Jersey in the morning, States Members, clergy, the Bailiff of Jersey, the Lieutenant-Governor, Jurats, Crown Officers and other officials process from the Royal Square to Liberation Square accompanied by the Royal Mace and the Bailiff's Seal. An open air ecumenical service takes place in Liberation Square followed by the singing of \"Man Bieau P'tit Jèrri\"/\"Beautiful Jersey\" (in Jèrriais and English) and a re-enactment of the raising of flags (including that at Fort Regent). A parade of vintage and military vehicles, bands and service organisations is reviewed by the official party.\n\nThe afternoon community celebrations are of an informal character, including a programme of entertainments and stalls in Saint Helier.\n\nAn official ceremony also takes place at the Crematorium where there is a memorial to victims and slave workers of various nationalities.

{"id": "7124827", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7124827", "title": "Manoel Theatre", "text": "Manoel Theatre\n\nThe Manoel Theatre (; ) is a theatre and important performing arts venue in Malta. The theatre is often referred to as simply \"The Manoel\", and is named after Grand Master of the Order of the Knights Hospitaller, Fra António Manoel de Vilhena, who ordered its construction in 1731. The theatre is reputed to be Europe's third-oldest working theatre (older than the San Carlo in Naples), and the oldest theatre still in operation in the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe theatre is located on Old Theatre Street (Maltese: \"Triq it-Teatru l-Antik\") in Valletta. It considers itself as the country's national theatre and the home of Malta Philharmonic Orchestra (Maltese: \"Orkestra Filarmonika Nazzjonali\"). Originally called the \"Teatro Pubblico,\" its name was changed to \"Teatro Reale,\" or Theatre Royal, in 1812, and renamed \"Manoel Theatre\" in 1866. The first play to be performed was Maffei's Merope. \n\nThe theatre is a small, 623 seat venue, with an oval-shaped auditorium, three tiers of boxes constructed entirely of wood, decorated with gold leaf, and a pale blue trompe-l'oeil ceiling that resembles a round cupola. The building is a Grade 1 listed building as noted by Malta's Superintendence of Cultural Heritage, and is also scheduled by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA).\n\nBefore the construction of the theatre, plays and amateur theatrical productions were staged in the halls and \"piano nobiles\" of the Knights' auberges. These were palaces constructed for the \"langues\" of the Order. The Langue of Italy often held such entertainment, staged by its knights in their Auberge. The records of the Langue even state that on February 2, 1697, some Maltese gentlemen presented a play in the \"Auberge d'Italie.\" Women were prohibited from attending these events after incidents during the Carnival festivities of 1639.\n\nIn 1731, António Manoel de Vilhena commissioned and personally funded the construction of the building to serve as a public theatre \"for the honest recreation of the people.\" The Grand Master bought two houses from the Priory of Navarre, with a frontage on what is now Old Theatre Street for the sum of 2,186 \"scudi\". It has a plain façade, in keeping with Valletta's Mannerist style, and has three floors with a mezzanine-level above the ground floor. The façade incorporates a doorway surmounted by a stone balustraded open balcony, itself supported by three heavy scroll corbels. The interior is decorated in Rococo style. The theatre was possibly designed by Romano Carapecchia, and was built by Francesco Zerafa and Antonio Azzopardi.\n\nConstruction was finished in only ten months. This however, may be because alterations were made to the fabric of the three adjoining houses, incorporating them into a theatre. The building occupied an area of 94½ square canes, which was later altered to 93 square canes and 2½ palms. The theatre is said to have been modelled after the contemporary Palermo Theatre. Its auditorium was originally semi-circular or horseshoe shaped, with an illuminated parterre that served as a small dance floor. The first theatrical performance to be staged at the \"Teatro Pubblico\" was Scipione Maffei's classic tragedy \"Merope\", on January 9, 1732. The actors in that production were the Knights themselves, and the set was designed by the Knights' chief military architect, Francois Mondion.\n\nOn January 26, 1732 a satirical and anti-clerical play \"Il bacchettiere falso\" by Girolamo Gigli was performed. On January 18, 1769, the play \"Il trionfo di Minerva\", by Lentisco Adrasteo was presented on the occasion of Grand Master Manuel Pinto da Fonseca's birthday. A similar honour was also given to Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, on his elevation as Grand Master. On this occasion, Hompesch appeared on the balcony thanking the crowd, showering handfuls of gold coins on the people that had gathered to applaud. Over the course of the next half-century, it was the venue for an extensive repertoire of lyric operas performed by companies of visiting professionals or by amateur groups of knights, and French tragedies or Italian comedies. Works by Johann Adolf Hasse, Niccolò Piccinni and Baldassare Galuppi were extremely popular at the theatre during its early years.\n\nIn its early days, the management of the theatre, and censorship of its performances, was entrusted to a senior knight, known as the \"Protettore.\" The first recorded impresario was Melchiorre Prevvost Lanarelli in 1736, and the last Giovanni Le Brun in 1866. From 1768 to 1770 the impresario was a woman, Natala Farrugia. In setting up the theatre, Grand Master de Vilhena set the rent to be paid by the impresario at 320 \"scudi\" per annum, of which 80 accrued for rent from Easter to August, 120 for autumn, and another 120 \"scudi\" from Christmas to Carnival. When dances or \"veglioni\" (masked ball) were held in the theatre, the pit was raised by a scaffolding to the level of the stage. On August 22, 1778, regulations were passed for the lighting of the theatre and corridors on such occasions, with the shading of lights, in any manner, being prohibited. In 1778, to avoid scandal, theatre companies were prohibited from sleeping in the boxes of the theatre. This was a practice which was common during that time. A few years later, in 1783, the \"Teatro Pubblico\" underwent considerable modification and decoration, based on a design by the Roman architect, Natale Marini. A model was displayed before the inquisitor and many knights, and the model was so admired that the Commissioners of the Foundation of the Theatre decided to add a further two \"louis,\" as a bonus to Marini’s invoice of 49 \"scudi.\"\n\nNicolas Isouard's first known opera, \"Casaciello perseguitato da un mago,\" was performed here in 1792, and Isouard became director of this theatre in 1798, after the French captured Malta, and continued to premiere other operas there. Several of Isouard's own works, including \"Avviso ai Maritati\" and \"Artaserse\", were performed at the Manoel during this time. French rule over Malta was short-lived and within two years the islands passed into the hands of Great Britain. An English gentleman who accompanied Abercrombie’s expedition to Egypt in 1801, wrote that:\n\"La Valette possesses an opera, small indeed, but neat, though much out of repair. Italy and Sicily supply it with very tolerable vocal performers, and it is a very agreeable entertainment for the garrison. It was excessively crowded every night by the officers of the expedition, to whom it was a great source of amusement. The price of admission is one shilling.\"\n\nDuring the early British Era, the \"Teatro Pubblico\" was renamed as the \"Teatro Reale\", going through a series of enlargements and re-modellings throughout the 19th century, most notably in 1812, when Sir George Whitmore added today's gallery and proscenium, raised the ceiling by one storey, and added eight more boxes, bringing the total to 67. Whitmore also transformed the auditorium to the oval shape that it has today. Further alterations were made in 1844, when the Manoel’s set designer, Ercolani, repainted the panels on the wooden boxes and had them gilded. Another stratum of silver leaf was added to the panels and ceiling in 1906. Throughout this time, the Teatro Reale was rented out to professional impresarios, who hosted nine-month opera seasons. It was visited by many foreign dignitaries, including Sir Walter Scott, and H.M. Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager, widow of William IV of England, who attended performances of \"Elisir d'Amore\" and \"Gemma di Vergy\" at the theatre, during her convalescence in Malta. \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" was given as a gala night in honour of the Queen Dowager, featuring soprano Camilla Darbois. English and Italian opera and operetta were the most popular productions at the \"Teatro Reale\" throughout the 19th century; however, the Maltese public was particularly supportive of operas by Rossini, Bellini, Donizetti and Verdi.\n\nIn 1861, the Teatro Reale was given on perpetual lease, by the government, to Dr. Salvatore Mifsud and Anacleto Conti for an annual ground rent of £236,15, and in 1862, the directum dominium was sold to Emmanuele Scicluna for £7,833.6.8. Subsequent owners were Carmelo Arpa, a chemist (1889) and the Gollcher family (1906-7). The theatre had fallen into disuse in 1866, as a result of the construction of Malta's new Royal Opera House, designed by Edward Middleton Barry, on Strada Reale, at the entrance to Valletta. The theatre began to serve as a doss house for homeless and indigent citizens, who rented out the stalls for a few pennies a night. However, in 1873, the \"Teatro Reale\" - was officially renamed the \"\"Manoel Theatre\", and it enjoyed a brief new lease on life when the Royal Opera House burnt down. But by 1877, the Royal Opera House had been rebuilt, and once more, the Manoel Theatre was eclipsed and fell again into disuse. On December 27, 1922, January 6, 1923 and February 3, 1923, the Manoel Theatre was the venue for the first public airing of Malta's National Anthem, \"L-Innu Malti.\"\" During the Second World War, the Manoel Theatre served as emergency accommodation for victims of the constant bombardment by the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica. In the early 20th century, it was also used intermittently as the venue for Carnival balls and, for a period of about twenty years, it operated as a movie theatre.\n\nThe theatre was included on the Antiquities List of 1925.\n\nDespite numerous alterations over the years, it retains many of its old architectural features, such as the white Carrara marble staircase, shell-shaped niches, and Viennese chandeliers. Two water reservoirs beneath the floor create an acoustic environment that is so precise, that the hushed page-turnings of an orchestra conductor can be heard clearly throughout the auditorium.\n\nFollowing the destruction of the Royal Opera House by Axis bombardment on April 7, 1942, the Manoel Theatre was expropriated by the Government of Malta in 1956, and was quickly restored to its former glory. It reopened in December 1960 with a performance of Coppélia by Ballet Rambert. In subsequent years the theatre foyer was enlarged by means of the annexation of the adjacent Palazzo Bonici, a grand 18th century palace that was the former home of the Testaferrata Bonnici family, however on January 9, 2007, the Constitutional Court of Malta revoked the 1958 order of possession and use in respect of this property, and ordered that the property be returned to its original owner. This annex currently houses the theatre's bar and restaurant.\n\nThe theatre is being restored by the Manoel Theatre Restoration Committee. Previous restoration attempts done in the 1970s were heavily criticised, with the removal of a balcony and the reinforcement of old stone with new masonry. The first phase of the new restoration took place in 2003, and included the restoration of the paintings on the frontispiece of the auditorium boxes. In 2004, the auditorium was restored by a team of \"Sante Guido Restauro e Conservazione di Opere d'Arte,\" who unearthed paintings that will allow the understanding of the theatre's development. This second phase included the cleaning of the gilt. The third phase included the restoration of the proscenium arch and the boxes it incorporates, while the fourth phase of the restoration project was the ceiling’s restoration, which was inaugurated on October 3, 2006. Although controversial, an application to restore the theatre's façade was approved by Maltese planning and heritage supervisory bodies and was restored in 2017.\n\nToday, the Manoel Theatre continues to put up a broad variety of theatrical productions in both English and Maltese, opera, musical recitals (including lunchtime recitals in \"Sala Isouard\"), poetry recitals, dramatic readings, and an annual Christmas pantomime, produced by the \"Malta Amateur Dramatic Club\". Management of the theatre is currently entrusted to Chairman Michael Grech, deputy chairman Kenneth Zammit Tabona, and board members Mario Philip Azzopardi, Anita Alosio and Lino Farrugia. Many productions are regularly presented, both by local talent and international stars, and the theatre has been a source for the cultural appreciation of the arts in Malta. Since 1960, it has had an official Management Committee and is no longer rented out for whole seasons to impresarios as in the past.The theatre's musical programmes retain some variety, but the main emphasis during recent decades has been on instrumental music. \n\nThe theatre is listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.\n\n\nMany opera singers, musicians and troupes have graced its stage. These include Boris Christoff, Mirella Freni, Rosanna Carteri, Cecilia Gasdia, Louis Kentner, Flaviano Labò, Dame Moura Lympany, Sir Yehudi Menuhin, John Neville, Magda Olivero, Michael Ponti, Katia Ricciarelli, Mstislav Rostropovich, Dame Margaret Rutherford, Steve Hackett, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Sir Donald Wolfit. Visiting companies at the Manoel Theatre have included Nottingham Playhouse, the Comédie-Française and the Staatsballett Berlin (Berlin State Opera Ballet).\n\nCoordinates: \n"}

The competition was organised by Sveriges Television (SVT) and took place over the six-week period between 6 February and 12 March 2016.\n\nFor the 15th consecutive year, the format of the competition consisted of six shows: four semi-final rounds, a second chance round and a final. The 28 competing entries were divided into four semi-finals, with seven compositions in each. From each semi-final, the songs that earned first and second place qualified directly to the final, while the songs that placed third and fourth proceeded to the Second Chance round. The bottom three songs in each semi-final were eliminated from the competition. An additional four entries qualified from the Second Chance round to the final, bringing the total number of competing entries in the final to 12.

At the contest, Sweden placed fifth out of the 26 competing nations in the final, scoring 261 points.\n\nMelodifestivalen 2016, organised by Sveriges Television (SVT), was the fifteenth consecutive edition of the contest in which the competition took place in different cities across Sweden. The four semi-finals were held at the Scandinavium in Gothenburg (6 February), the Malmö Arena in Malmö (13 February), the Himmelstalundshallen in Norrköping (20 February) and the Gavlerinken Arena in Gävle (27 February). The Second Chance round took place at the Halmstad Arena in Halmstad on 5 March while the final was held at the Friends Arena in Solna on 12 March. An initial twenty-eight entries were intended to compete in the semi-finals, with seven entries taking part in each show. The first semi-final only featured six entries after one of the competing songs was disqualified. The top two entries from each semi-final advanced directly to the final, while the third and fourth placed entries advanced to the Second Chance round. The bottom three entries in each semi-final were eliminated. An additional four entries qualified to the final from the Second Chance round, bringing the total number of competing entries in the final to twelve.\n\nChrister Björkman was announced as the executive producer of the competition, while Annette Helenius was assigned as the project manager, replacing Maria Ilstedt and Christel Tholse Willers from the previous year.\n\nEntries for the 2016 competition were selected through three methods:\n\nSVT opened two submission contests that accepted entries between 1 and 16 September 2015 for interested artists and songwriters to submit their proposals for the competition. The \"Regular contest\" was open for entries that had at least one songwriter that already had a musical work published, while the \"Public contest\" accepted entries from songwriters without previously published musical work. Entries submitted for the competition were required to be new compositions which had never been published between 2–3 minutes in length and with at least one songwriter that had Swedish citizenship. The choice of language was free, however, SVT reserved 30% of the contest's places for entries sung mainly in Swedish. SVT also aimed to have at least 50% of the contest's places for entries written by female composers and lyricists either in a solo or collaborative capacity.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the submission periods, SVT received 2,450 entries—an increase of 273 entries from the previous year. 1,982 of the entries were entered into the \"Regular contest\", while 468 entries were entered into the \"Public contest\". SVT created a shortlist of entries from the received submissions and formed a selection panel that was tasked to select fourteen entries for the competition. The selection panel consisted of seventeen members: ten men and seven women 18–64 years of age. Half of the jury members represented people working in or involved with the music industry (professional dancers, artist managers, music editors and programme/music directors) and the other half consisted of members of the public who are viewers of Melodifestivalen (with professions such as engineers, bloggers, teachers, consultants and students).\n\nAt a press conference on 17 November 2015, Gina Dirawi was presented as the main host for all six shows of Melodifestivalen 2016. Her selection as the host made Dirawi the first woman to host Melodifestivalen three times, having previously presented the competition in 2012 and 2013. Dirawi was joined by guest co-hosts during each show: Petra Mede (Semi-final 1), Henrik Schyffert (Semi-final 3), Sarah Dawn Finer (Semi-final 4), Peter Jöback (Second Chance round), Ola Salo (Second Chance round) and William Spetz (Final). Originally, Charlotte Perrelli was announced as the guest co-host for the second semi-final, however, after a breach of contract arose regarding Perrelli's endorsement deal with mobile phone brand Comviq, her role in the programme was changed to guest performer. Mede, Schyffert, Finer and Perrelli had all hosted Melodifestivalen on previous occasions; Mede in 2009, Schyffert in 2005, Finer in 2012 and Perrelli in 2003 and 2004.\n\nDuring the six shows, viewers could cast their votes through telephone, SMS and mobile application voting. For telephone and SMS voting, viewers were able to cast their vote through two different voting lines per voting method: a regular line costing 3.60 SEK and a donation line costing 9.90 SEK of which 8.90 SEK was donated to the charity organisation Radiohjälpen. Up to 20 votes could be cast per phone number per voting line, allowing a single phone number to contribute a maximum of 80 votes in each round of voting. With the mobile application, each device could send up to 5 votes for free per entry. The results of the semi-finals and Second Chance round were determined solely by viewer votes, while in the final, the results were determined through a 50/50 combination of viewer votes and the votes of eleven international jury groups. 36,711,512 votes were cast in total during the six shows with 4,633,907 SEK collected for Radiohjälpen.\n\nThe twenty-eight competing entries were announced to the public during a press conference on 30 November 2015. Prior to the press conference, it was only known that the group Smilo (formerly Smajling Swedes) had been selected for the competition from the artists that participated in the \"Svensktoppen nästa\" competition organised by Sveriges Radio P4.\n\nAmong the competing artists were former Melodifestivalen winners Tommy Nilsson (1989) and Martin Stenmarck (2005).

The disqualification came two days before the song was set to be performed in the first semi-final after it was discovered that the song had previously competed in the audition stage of the 2014 Moldovan Eurovision Song Contest national selection under the title \"Taking Care of a Broken Heart\" with lyrics in English.\n\nAs in previous years, Melodifestivalen commenced with four semi-finals, which determined the eight entries that advanced directly to the final and the eight entries that qualified to the Second Chance round. The running order for each semi-final was announced on 12 January 2016.\n\nThe semi-final results were based solely on viewer votes. Two rounds of voting took place in each semi-final to determine which entries would advance further and which entries would be eliminated. All seven competing entries in each semi-final (six in the first semi-final) participated in the first round of voting where the top five advanced to the second round, while the bottom two were eliminated. In the second round of voting, the two entries that occupied the first and second places qualified directly to the final, while the third and fourth placed entries proceeded to the Second Chance round. The fifth placed entry was eliminated. All votes from the second round of voting were added to the votes that each entry received from the first round of voting in order to determine the final outcome.\nThe first semi-final took place on 6 February 2016 at the Scandinavium in Gothenburg, hosted by Gina Dirawi and Petra Mede. \"Don't Worry\" performed by Ace Wilder and \"Constellation Prize\" performed by Robin Bengtsson qualified directly to the final, while \"Bada nakna\" performed by Samir and Viktor and \"Rik\" performed by Albin and Mattias advanced to the Second Chance round.

The eight entries that placed third and fourth in the preceding four semi-finals competed during the show in four duels. SVT decided which entries would face off in each duel. Viewers determined the results during the show through telephone, SMS and application voting. Voting in each duel commenced at the start of the first entry's performance and concluded one minute and thirty seconds following the end of the second entry's performance.

Each jury group distributed their points as follows: 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 points. The viewer vote was based on the percentage of votes each song achieved through the following voting methods: telephone, SMS and mobile application. For example, if a song gained 10% of the viewer vote, then that entry would be awarded 10% of 473 points rounded to the nearest integer: 47 points.

Such nostalgia is observed among people in Russia and the other post-Soviet states, as well as persons born in the Soviet Union but long since living abroad.\n\nIn 2004 a television channel Nostalgiya stylized with a hammer and sickle was launched in Russia.\n\nAccording to polls, what is missed most about the former Soviet Union was its shared economic system, which provided a modicum of financial stability. Neoliberal economic reforms after the fall of the USSR and the Eastern Bloc resulted in harsh living standards for the general population. Policies associated with privatization allowed of the country's economy to fall in the hands of a newly established business oligarchy. The sense of belonging to a great superpower was a secondary reason for the nostalgia; many felt humiliated and betrayed by their experiences throughout the 1990s and blamed the upheaval on advisors from Western powers, especially as NATO moved closer into Russia's sphere of influence. \n\nAccording to Dr. Kristen R.

The film festival is a very cosmopolitan event; prior to 2002, it was reserved to \"non-aligned and other developing countries.\"\n\nThe event originated in 1987 as the Pyongyang Film Festival of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries. The maiden event, held from September 1 through September 10, showed short films, features, and documentaries that were judged for competitive awards.\n\nThe film festival returned in 1990 and would be regularly held every other year. Recurrent subject matter included domestic cinema that commonly praised the high leadership such as a film shown at the 1992 film festival, verbosely translated, \"Glory of Our People in Holding the Great Leader in High Esteem\", and foreign films about revolutionary resistance.\n\nIn 2000, officials widened the acceptable breadth of film watching, by screening Japanese films for the first time when Yoji Yamada arrived to present six of his films.\n\nThe ninth festival, held in 2004, moderated cultural restrictions further with the screening of a dubbed and censored version of the British comedy \"Bend It Like Beckham\" and U.S.-produced South African drama \"Cry, The Beloved Country\". \"Bend it like Beckham\" won the music prize and later it became the first Western-made film shown on television in North Korea.\n\nIn 2006, the Swedish horror comedy \"Frostbiten\" was shown at the festival, the first foreign horror film to ever be shown in North Korea.\n\n\"The Schoolgirl's Diary\", which premiered at the 2006 festival, in 2007 became the first North Korean film in several decades to be picked up for international distribution, when it was purchased by French company Pretty Pictures. It was released in France in late 2007.\n\nThe festival is held in the autumn every two years. It has an international jury and both competitive and non-competitive submissions. In that sense, it is \"structured ... very much like any other international film festival\".\n\nSince 2000, the festival has been dominated by films from Western Europe. Many of the films are censored and often have themes emphasising family values, loyalty and the temptations of money. In 2008, 110 films were shown from a total of 46 countries. South Korean films are not shown because of the current political climate. Films critical of North Korean from anywhere in the world are not allowed and neither are sexually explicit films. Anything else goes, and the organizers try to get as many films and visitors to attend. Diplomatic connections or the personal initiative of filmmakers is what often results in a film being admitted. The result is often \"an odd mix\" of films that are not united by one genre. In recent years, the festival has enjoyed recent popularity abroad, mainly due to the success of South Korean cinema prompting foreign film enthusiasts' curiosity about the North. Consequentially, film submissions have increased and the selection of films has improved in quality.\n\nIn 2016, the animated Spanish film \"\" was featured, became the first animated Spanish film and the first comic's adaptation to be shown.\n\nThe festival is one of the few North Korean functions that actively seeks connection with the outside world. Johannes Schönherr, author of \"North Korean Cinema: A History\" and a festival delegate in 2000, said \"The Pyongyang International Film Festival is a big propaganda event and foreigners who attend the event become extras in the big propaganda show.\"\n\n\n\n"}

However, in addition to providing options, repertoires can be seen as limiting, as people tend to focus on familiar tools and actions, and innovation outside their scope is uncommon (see diffusion of innovations).\n\nActions and tools that belong to common repertoires of contention include, but are not limited to: creation of special-purpose associations and coalitions, public meetings, solemn processions, vigils, rallies, demonstrations, sit-ins, petition drives, statements to and in public media, boycotts, strikes and pamphleteering. Repertoires change over time, and can vary from place to place. They are determined both by what the actors know how to do, and what is expected from them. Early repertoires, from the time before the rise of the modern social movement, included food riots and banditry. The changing nature of repertoires of contention can be seen in a sample element of the mid-18th century British repertoire of contention, the rough music: a humiliating and loud public punishment inflicted upon one or more people who have violated the standards of the rest of the community. For yet another example, consider that in the recent years, Internet-focused repertoires have been developed (see hacktivism). Recent scholarship has introduced a notion that in addition to the \"traditional\" and \"modern\" repertoires, a new, \"digital\", repertoire may be emerging.\n\nWhile the term is used most often in the social movement theory context, it can be applied to any political actors. Repertoires of contention also existed before the birth of the modern social movement (a period most scholars identify as the late 18th to early 19th century).\n\nThe term is attributed to Charles Tilly.\n\n"}

It has been the subject of several major leaks or undercover investigations by activists and reporters since 1989.\n\nSHAC was started in November 1999 by three British animal rights activists—Greg Avery, Heather James, and Natasha Dellemagne—after video footage supposed to have been shot covertly inside HLS in 1997 by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) showed HLS staff shaking, punching, and shouting at beagles in their care. The footage was broadcast by Channel 4 in the UK, the employees were dismissed and prosecuted, and HLS's licence to perform animal experiments was revoked for six months. PETA stopped its protests against the company after HLS threatened it with legal action, and SHAC took over as a leaderless resistance.\n\nThe campaign used tactics ranging from non-violent protest to the alleged firebombing of houses owned by executives associated with HLS's clients and investors. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), which monitors US domestic extremism, has described SHAC's \"modus operandi\" as \"frankly terroristic tactics similar to those of anti-abortion extremists,\" and in 2005 an official with the FBI's counter-terrorism division referred to SHAC's activities in the United States as domestic terrorist threats.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, 13 members of SHAC, including Avery, James, and Dellemagne, were jailed for between 15 months and eleven years on charges of conspiracy to blackmail or harm HLS and its suppliers.\n\nOn 12 August 2014, SHAC officially announced it was closing its campaign.\n\nHLS tests household cleaners, pesticides, weedkillers, cosmetics, food additives, chemicals for use in industry, and drugs for use against Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. It uses around 75,000 animals every year, including rats, rabbits, pigs, dogs, and primates (marmosets, macaques, and wild-caught baboons).\n\nThe company has been the subject of several undercover investigations since 1989. Sarah Kite of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) secured a job and filmed inside HLS in 1989. Zoe Broughton did the same for Channel Four in 1996, as Michelle Rokke claimed to have done for PETA in 1997. Lucy Johnston for \"The Daily Express\" gained access in 2000. A diary kept by Kite, who worked undercover there for eight months, alleged that HLS workers routinely mishandled the animals, shouting at them, throwing them into their cages, and mocking them for having fits in response to toxicity tests. In 1997, Zoe Broughton came out with footage showing puppies being hit and shaken. A year later, Michelle Rokke allegedly obtained footage of the vivisection of a monkey in HLS in New Jersey, in which a technician expresses concern that the animal is inadequately anaesthetized. Between 2006 and 2008, an Animal Defenders International employee filmed undercover inside HLS after securing a position inside its primate toxicology unit in Cambridgeshire.\n\nAccording to Mark Matfield of the Research Defence Society, a pro-animal testing lobby group in the UK, HLS lost a great deal of business after these investigations, primarily among the pharmaceutical industry. \"There was an ingrained feeling among scientists and business people that this company had transgressed in a very serious way,\" he said.\n\nSHAC was founded in November 1999 by Greg Avery; his second wife, Natasha Avery (née Dellemagne); and his first wife, Heather Nicholson (née James). Avery and Nicholson had been involved in previous high-profile campaigns against facilities in the UK that bred animals for laboratories. In 1997, after a ten-month campaign, they caused the closure of Consort Kennels, which bred beagles for animal research. Later that year, they started Save the Hill Grove Cats against Hill Grove farm in Oxfordshire, which bred cats for laboratories. The farm closed after two years.\n\nSHAC maintained a decentralized approach with no official central leadership, allowing activists throughout the UK and North America to act autonomously, though \"The Guardian\" described Avery in 2008 as the \"de facto\" leader. After Avery was jailed, another activist, Thomas Harris, ran the group in the UK until he was imprisoned in 2010. Before their convictions, Nicholson, Avery, and Dellemagne would publish reports on the SHAC website and by mail, and provide press information and interviews; in April 2004 they were reported to be living together rent-free in a cottage provided by a supporter, Virginia Jane Steele. SHAC also obtains income from fundraising stalls. According to \"The Times\", one stall in London's Oxford Street could generate £500 in a single day, and in total around £1 million in donations had been raised by 2008.\n\nAccording to prosecutors in a 2008 court case, the senior members of SHAC co-ordinated the campaign from a cottage in Little Moorcote, near Hook, Hampshire. They would meet every three months to receive updates from colleagues in the United States and Europe. According to \"The Times\", Gavin Medd-Hall, a former computer technician, would lead research into potential targets. The police found spreadsheets at the cottage documenting the location of targets and details about their children and security arrangements. Sarah Whitehead, an experienced campaigner known in the group as \"Mumsy\", would lead younger members and carry up to five attacks in a night, according to the judge.\n\nSHAC USA was founded in 2004 by Kevin Jonas, sometimes spelled Kjonaas by the media, a political science graduate of the University of Minnesota, after he had spent two years working in the UK with Greg Avery. Prosecutors in the U.S. said that a house in Somerset, New Jersey — a few miles from a HLS laboratory — was the headquarters of SHAC USA; Jonas lived there with Lauren Gazzola, SHAC USA's campaign co-ordinator, and Jacob Conroy. According to Jonas, the \"SHAC campaign\" came to mean any action aimed at contributing to the demise of HLS, whether legal or not, while SHAC itself referred only to the incorporated group that ran a news and information service. Jonas writes that these distinctions were made in various legal proceedings. He told the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2002: \"There's a very famous quote by John F. Kennedy. 'If you make peaceful revolution impossible, you make violent revolution inevitable.'\" After he was imprisoned in 2006 for inciting harassment against HLS, Pamelyn Ferdin, a former child actor, became president of SHAC USA.\n\nSHAC's \"modus operandi\" is known as secondary and tertiary targeting. Activists engage in direct action—ranging from lawful protests to intimidation, harassment, and violent attacks—not only against HLS, its employees, and its employees' families, but also against secondary and tertiary targets such as HLS's business partners, and \"their\" business partners, insurers, caterers, cleaners, children's nursery schools, and office suppliers. A New York yacht club, for example, was covered in red paint because members of the club worked for Carr Securities, which traded in HLS shares. The campaign drove down HLS's profits, suppressed its share price, and made it difficult to find business and financial partners.\n\nThe SHAC website said it published names and addresses only so that people could protest within the law, but testimony to the British House of Commons in 2003 included excerpts from a document reported to have come from SHAC, which advised activists on tactics for protests outside targets' homes. These included throwing rape alarms in roof guttering at night, setting off fireworks, and ordering taxis and pizzas.\n\nIn 2001, HLS managing director in the UK, Brian Cass, was beaten outside his home by three masked men — animal rights activist David Blenkinsop was sentenced to three years in prison for the attack — and HLS marketing director Andrew Gay was attacked on his doorstep with a chemical spray to his eyes that left him temporarily blinded.\n\nIn 2000, SHAC obtained a list of HLS shareholders, including the names of usually anonymous beneficial owners — those holding shares through third parties — and the pension funds of the British Labour Party, Rover cars, and the London Borough of Camden. The list was passed to \"The Sunday Telegraph\", which published it on 3 December 2000, and several beneficial owners disposed of their shares; the Labour Party sold its 75,000 shares in January 2001. Two weeks after the \"Telegraph\" story, an equity stake of 32 million shares was placed on the London Stock Exchange for one penny each.\n\nOn 21 December 2000, HLS was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange because its market capitalization had fallen below NYSE limits, and on 29 March 2001, HLS lost both of its market makers and its place on the London Stock Exchange. Shortly after this, HLS moved its headquarters to the United States, incorporating as Life Sciences Research (LSR), and secured a $15m loan from investment bank Stephens, Inc, its largest shareholder. In September 2005, after the firebombing of the homes of a Canadian brokerage employee and a British pharmaceutical executive, the New York Stock Exchange asked LSR to delay moving its listing from the OTC Bulletin Board to the main exchange. LSR has since transferred its listing to the NYSE Arca electronic exchange. HLS is no longer a publicly traded company after being bought by CEO Andrew Baker.\n\nIn June 2005, Vancouver-based brokerage Canaccord Capital announced that it had dropped a client, Phytopharm PLC, in response to the May 2005 Animal Liberation Front (ALF) firebombing of a car belonging to Canaccord executive Michael Kendall. The ALF stated on its website that activists placed an incendiary device under the car, which was in Kendall's garage at home when it caught fire during the night. Kendall and his family went into hiding. Phytopharm was targeted, as were those doing business with it, because it had business links with HLS.\n\nIn May 2006, an anonymous group said it would be writing to every one of GlaxoSmithKline's 170,000 small investors warning them to sell their shares. The letters began arriving at investors' home addresses on 7 May 2006, asking that shares be sold within 14 days, and that the group be informed of the sale by e-mail via a Hotmail address. The number of letters sent was smaller than claimed; the BBC said at least 50 shareholders received the warning. Writing in \"The Sunday Telegraph\" the following week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed support for animal experimentation in the face of an \"appalling ... campaign of intimidation.\" \n\nThe SHAC website features ALF news. Kevin Jonas — who took charge of SHAC UK while the Averys and James were jailed for six months in 2002 — declared his support for the ALF, and Robin Webb, spokesman for the ALF in the UK, attended and addressed SHAC conferences in the United States.\n\nA posting on the website \"Bite Back\" on 7 September 2005 claimed the ALF had carried out an attack on the home of Paul Blackburn, corporate controller of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in Buckinghamshire, because GSK is a customer of HLS. The activists admitted to detonating a device containing two litres of fuel and four pounds of explosives on the doorstep of Blackburn's home. In 2006 the ALF warned that it was targeting HLS suppliers, and that year firebombed a car belonging to the finance director of Canaccord Capital, a brokerage firm. Members of SHAC said the company had acted as brokers for Phytopharm, which had used HLS for contract testing.\n\nIn December 2006, Donald Currie was jailed for 12 years in connection with fire bombing offenses against HLS customers; police described him as an \"active bomber for the Animal Liberation Front.\"\n\nA British police operation found that the core group of SHAC activists would compile private encrypted reports detailing the legal protests and an illegal blackmail campaign—the former attributed to SHAC, the latter claimed by the ALF or Animal Rights Militia. In 2008 and 2010 when 13 SHAC members, including the Averys and Nicholson, were convicted of conspiracy to blackmail, police said their actions were on behalf of the ALF; senior members of SHAC were regarded by police as key figures within the ALF, according to \"The Guardian\". The members had sent incriminating emails describing their involvement in direct action, including one email sent to \"Bite Back\" in 2007 providing the details of an ALF attack the previous evening. SHAC spokespersons have denied any link between their campaign and the ALF.\n\nThe FBI linked SHAC with attacks claimed by the militant animal rights group, the Animal Liberation Brigade. They issued an arrest warrant for Daniel Andreas San Diego, who they described as being \"involved with the Stop Huntington Animal Cruelty campaign\", in connection with bomb attacks against two of HLS's clients in California. A wiretap of Kevin Jonas' telephone revealed San Diego had called him on the day of one of the bombings. San Diego was added to the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists List in 2009 and remains at large.\n\nSeveral companies targeted by SHAC in the UK obtained injunctions. These include HLS itself, Chiron UK, Phytopharm, Daiichi UK, Asahi Glass, Eisai, Yamanouchi Pharma, Sankyo Pharma, and BOC. The injunctions compelled SHAC to print the injunction on their website, so that SHAC's action targets were juxtaposed with a legal notification that there was a 50-yard exclusion zone around the homes of employees and places of business. Protest outside HLS itself was allowed to occur one day a week with a police presence. HLS tried but failed in June 2004 to obtain a permanent injunction against SHAC. SHAC's argument against the enforceability of such injunctions was that, despite having hundreds of supporters, a website, mailing address, telephone information hotline, mailing list, and bank account, it does not exist as a corporate or charitable body, and therefore cannot prevent its supporters from taking action against HLS.\n\nSHAC's campaign prompted the introduction of sections 145–149 of the British Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, which created new offences intended to protect animal-testing facilities, including prohibiting acts or threats intended to cause someone to terminate or not enter into a contract with such a facility. The first person to be convicted under the Act was Joseph Harris, a doctor of molecular biology, who attacked property owned by companies supplying materials to HLS; he received a three-year sentence. In February 2007, a number of SHAC supporters were charged with illegal street collecting without a licence. According to the Metropolitan Police, two stalls in London's Oxford Street collected over £80,000 a year. In March 2007, three activists were jailed under the Act for intimidating HLS suppliers; one supplier dropped its contract with HLS after being invaded by demonstrators wearing skull masks.\n\nIn March 2006, a federal jury in Trenton, New Jersey, found six members of SHAC guilty of using their website to incite attacks on those who did business with HLS. Originally, seven individuals (the SHAC 7) were charged: Kevin Jonas (former president of Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty USA), Lauren Gazzola, Jacob Conroy, Joshua Harper, Andrew Stepanian, Darius Fullmer, and John McGee. McGee was later dropped from the case. They were charged with conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Protection Act, in the first application of the 1992 statute. Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and Harper were charged with conspiracy to harass using a telecommunications device (sending black faxes), while Jonas, Gazzola, Conroy, and SHAC USA were charged with stalking via the internet. The defense of the SHAC 7 rested largely on the 1969 case \"Brandenburg v. Ohio\", in which the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that political speech is legal unless it can be shown that a defendant has told specific individuals to commit specific, imminent acts of violence. They were sentenced on 3 March 2006, four of them to between three and six years, and ordered to pay joint restitution of $1,000,001.00. \n\nIn 2011, NPR reported that Andrew Stepanian of the SHAC 7 -- since released—had been imprisoned in the highly restrictive Communication Management Unit of the U.S. federal prison system.\n\nOn 1 May 2007, a series of raids—Operation Achilles—took place against SHAC in Europe, involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium. Thirty-two people were arrested, including Greg and Natasha Avery, and Heather Nicholson, who were charged with blackmail, along with nine others. The Averys pleaded guilty in July 2008, along with a co-accused Dan Amos. In October 2008 Trevor Holmes, Gerrah Selby, Daniel Wadham, Gavin Medd-Hall, and Heather Nicholson, who denied the charges, were sent to court. Prosecutors told jurors that a 2007 meeting between the defendants had been bugged by police, and revealed that SHAC supported illegal acts that were traced to attacks on people across Great Britain. The prosecution also alleged there was evidence of direct email links between SHAC, the Animal Liberation Front, and Animal Rights Militia. Holmes was acquitted but the other four were convicted.\n\nIn January 2009, Nicholson was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment, Greg and Natasha to nine years, Medd-Hall to eight years, Wadham to five years, and Selby and Amos to four years. Injunctions called Anti-Social Behaviour Orders were served on all seven, restricting their contact with companies targeted in the campaign. In 2009 \"The Sunday Times\" reported that Adrian Radford, a former soldier and gay rights activist, had befriended Natasha Avery and had been informing the police about the activity of senior SHAC members between 2004 and 2007. \"Der Spiegel\" wrote that as a result of the police operation the number of attacks on HLS and associated businesses declined drastically, although the day after the convictions new posts on SHAC's website indicated that the campaign would continue.\n\nIn 2008, activists from various groups, including SHAC, targeted Highgate Rabbit Farm in Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, which sold rabbits and ferrets to HLS and other laboratories; the \"Close Highgate Farm\" campaign included an ALF raid in which 129 rabbits were removed and £100,000-worth of property damaged. In 2009, a new group, Militant Forces Against Huntingdon Life Sciences, emerged in Germany and Switzerland, targeting Bayer staff, a Novartis director, the CEO of Pfizer, and Highgate farm, among others.\n\nIn 2010, five more members of SHAC pleaded guilty to criminal charges. Sarah Whitehead, Nicole Vosper and Thomas Harris plead guilty to conspiracy to blackmail; Jason Mullan and Nicola Tapping plead guilty to breaching section 145 of SOCPA. They were all jailed for between six years and fifteen months. \"The Times\" reported that their activities included \"posting hoax bombs to homes and offices, making threats of violence, daubing abusive graffiti on property and sending used tampons in the post.\" Harris' sentence was extended after he, Maria Neal and Christopher Potter also pleaded guilty to additional charges relating to attacks on branches of Barclays, including painting \"ALF\" on the buildings. At the time Barclays Asset Management was linked to HLS.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "52449262", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52449262", "title": "Supercar Challenge (series)", "text": "Supercar Challenge (series)\n\nThe Supercar Challenge is a motor racing series centered on the Benelux. A special feature is that touring cars, GTs and Sportscars can all participate on an equal basis within the same class, enabled by very open regulations. The championship was first held in 2001, after replacing the Supercar Cup. From 2001 to 2011 the championship was called the Dutch Supercar Challenge, but due to interest from drivers, teams and tracks outside the Netherlands the organisers decided to drop 'Dutch' from its name on 11 February 2012.\n\nA typical race weekend exists of the usual practice on Friday and Saturday, qualifying on Saturday and two races of 45 to 60 minutes with one pit stop of at least 60 seconds. One race is on Saturday and one Sunday. The four classes usually run separate races two classes at a time. The two fastest run together and the two slowest run their race separate. The exception is at Spa-Francorchamps where all four classes can and do run together in two races over the weekend. All races are started from a rolling start though in the past standing starts have been used as well. \"Success time\" is awarded after every race. The first-place finisher gets 15 seconds, second place gets 10, third place gets 5, fourth place loses 5 seconds, fifth place loses ten and all below fifth place lose 15 seconds. This is added to the time of the minimum pit stop duration. The reason no \"success ballast\" is used, is the immense variety in vehicles competing. For instance, a 50 kg weight has a much larger effect on a Lotus Elise than it has on a Dodge Viper Competition Coupe even though these can compete in the same class.\n\n\nDuring most of its lifetime the Supercar Challenge has served as a host to many single make series. In the first two years the Marcos Mantis Cup ran within the GT class. In 2003 it was fully integrated in the GT class. Starting in 2008 the Mosler Challenge has run within GT. In 2010 three series were added. Those are BRL V6 and the Saker Challenge, not to be confused with the series of the same name the DNRT hosts, both within Supersport I and BRL Light in Supersport II. The BRL series were before separate events and still have a slightly different calendar. The races at Silverstone don't pay them points while the races at the Zolder truck Grand Prix do though to all other classes they don't count.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "45395700", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45395700", "title": "Takenaga incident", "text": "Takenaga incident\n\nThe was a surrender by an Imperial Japanese Army battalion that occurred on 3 May 1945, near the end of the Pacific War. The battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Masaharu Takenaga, surrendered to the Australian Army in eastern New Guinea. This was extremely unusual for the Japanese Army, where surrender was seen as highly dishonourable.\n\nFrom March to April 1945, the 239th Infantry Regiment of the 41st Division, assigned to the Eighteenth Army of the Imperial Japanese Army, was engaged in hostilities with the Australian Army in eastern New Guinea. The Australians were pursuing them through the southern Torricelli Mountains, near Aitape, on the north coast. According to the records of the 41st Division, the 2nd Battalion, commanded by Takenaga and comprising around 50 soldiers, decided to head west, separating themselves from their regiment, who were retreating to the east. However, according to notes made by a sergeant major in the battalion, the main force of the regiment retreated without giving them any notice, after which they thought that they had been abandoned and decided to fend for themselves.\n\nIn the middle of April (the 12th, according to a villager), around 45 of Takenaga's men raided Tau, a village of only a few houses, in order to find food. Villagers armed with throwing spears and hand grenades attacked the soldiers as they were searching, which caused them to retaliate. The villagers quickly retreated, but the soldiers and the villagers suffered two fatalities each. The Japanese soldiers left Tau the next morning, but remained in the area.\n\nThe Australian Army learned of the presence of the Japanese troops through reports from police and villagers, and on 16 April they dispatched a platoon from the 2/5th Battalion, led by Lieutenant C. H. Miles, to deal with them. On 24 April, Miles' platoon came into contact with Takenaga's battalion, and two Japanese soldiers were killed after the two sides exchanged fire.\n\nTakenaga's troops managed to shake off pursuit by the Australians, but decided that they would surrender. They took a leaflet containing a notice of surrender that one of the soldiers had been carrying, added some conditions underneath in English, tied it to a pole for the Australians to find, and left the area. Scouts from Miles' platoon then found the leaflet and brought it back with them. On 2 May, the Australian platoon spotted Takenaga's unit near Womgrer village, and asked a native to help them make contact. Two truce bearers from the Japanese side came to the Australians to negotiate, and on the following day Takenaga's unit surrendered at Womgrer and were disarmed. At the time of surrender, Takenaga's unit consisted of 42 men: five officers (including Takenaga), four warrant officers, and 33 non-commissioned officers and soldiers. They were equipped with five light machine guns, 17 rifles, five pistols, and 750 rounds of ammunition. The prisoners, escorted by Miles' platoon, marched for three days in an orderly fashion to Maprik Airport, and were then transported to Aitape.\n\nThe other Japanese forces thought that Takenaga's unit had got lost, and attempted to search for them, but came to know of their surrender through propaganda posters distributed by the Australian Army.\n\nThere are two theories about the process that led Takenaga's unit to the decision to surrender. The first is that all of the members of the unit were involved in the decision, and the second is that only the officers were involved.\n\nAccording to Ikuhiko Hata and Fumio Takahashi, whom Hata depended on for his research, after the battalion commanders agreed to surrender, the other soldiers in Takenaga's unit were assembled to see whether they would agree with the plan. Takahashi and Hata say that according to one of the surviving company commanders, after being told that the surrender was an order from Takenaga, those in favour were asked to raise their hands. Then, when around half of the soldiers did not raise their hands, they were issued hand grenades and told that they should choose their own fate (a Japanese euphemism for suicide). After this, all of the soldiers agreed to the surrender plan.\n\nAn opposing point of view is held by Kiyohiko Satō, who says that only the battalion commanders were asked whether they agreed to the plan, and that the rest of the soldiers were not given a choice. According to Satō, the witnesses mentioned by Hata and Takahashi denied being interviewed on the subject at all. Furthermore, from freshly conducted interviews and from the sergeant major's notes, Satō infers that only the officers and warrant officers were involved in the decision to surrender, and that the other soldiers only received an order.\n\nIn the New Guinea campaign, the Eighteenth Army of Japan were left behind the Allied front, and although their position was of no strategic value, they still continued to fight. After United States forces crushed the 18th Army's counteroffensive in the Battle of Driniumor River, the Japanese were left alone. However, when the Australian Army took over the New Guinea campaign in the second half of 1944, they decided to do a thorough cleanup of the remaining Japanese forces.\n\nThe strength of the Japanese forces was greatly weakened, as their naval supply lines had been cut and they had lost most of their existing supplies at Driniumor River. While the usual size of a Japanese Army division in wartime was 20,000 troops, at the start of May, 1945, this had been reduced to only around 1000. Takenaga's unit was no exception: while it was a battalion in name, in terms of numbers it was on the scale of a platoon, and at that one with only around half the usual number of infantry. The rest of the unit was made up of former mountain artillery from the 41st Division, whose squads were disbanded when all of their guns were destroyed at Driniumor River, and marines, among others. Takenaga himself was an artillery specialist, and had been moved to the 239th Infantry Regiment from his post as commander of the 3rd Battalion, 41st Mountain Artillery Regiment. The 18th Army had predicted that their food and medicine would run out by September, 1945, and that their weapons would become unusable by the end of the year. The situation was so dire that in July the 18th Army gave the order (18th Army Order No. 371) that the entirety of its forces should adhere to \"gyokusai\", or honourable death without surrender, a move unprecedented even among the Imperial Army. One second lieutenant reflected that in the final stages of the campaign, the army had stopped being an army and had become a band of beggars.\n\nThe severity of the situation that the Japanese Army faced in New Guinea is demonstrated by the incidents of cannibalism that occurred there. Some commentators think that Takenaga's unit was among those where cannibalism was practised. There was suspicion that directly before they surrendered, Takenaga's unit ate the body of one of the villagers from Tau that had been killed in the fighting there, and the Australian Army decided to investigate. When they interrogated the prisoners from Takenaga's unit, they received statements indicating that some of the unit had been involved in eating the villager, but that the soldiers responsible had since died. For this reason, the Australian Army did not bring any charges of cannibalism against the prisoners. There are also records from survivors written after the war admitting that they were involved. From the fact that Australian Army records state that Takenaga's unit was healthy and orderly, Yuki Tanaka infers that the whole unit regularly practised cannibalism as a group. Kiyohiko Satō, while admitting that some of the unit members were involved in cannibalism, casts doubt over Tanaka's conclusions by pointing to evidence such as descriptions in notes left by the soldiers that suggests cannibalism was not a group practice.\n\nIn order to uphold the Senjinkun military code, it was considered extremely dishonourable to become an enemy prisoner in Japan at the time, even in a situation as desperate as the one faced by the Japanese Army in New Guinea. In the Japanese Army Penal Code, commanding officers ordering their troops to surrender was treated as a form of desertion, and even when troops gave their all in battle, surrender was still punishable by six months' imprisonment (article 41). Lieutenant General Hatazō Adachi, commander of the 18th Army, also gave an order on 18 March 1945, telling his soldiers that they should under no circumstances bring upon themselves the shame of being taken prisoner. As a result, examples of the Japanese Army surrendering as a group are extremely rare. Apart from Takenaga's unit, the only other examples of group surrender by the Japanese Army in the Pacific War were two other groups in New Guinea that are discussed below, and the Army Naval Raiding Squadron, commanded by Umezawa and defending Zamami Island, in the Battle of Okinawa. However, Takenaga's unit was not the first example; there was a previous incident in May, 1905, at the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, where 42 survivors of a company of the 49th Infantry Regiment of the 1st Division were all taken prisoner.\n\nThere was also a trend among the Australian Army to kill Japanese soldiers who attempted to surrender. There was an unspoken agreement among front-line Australian soldiers to kill all Japanese soldiers without taking any prisoners, and these actions were given tacit consent from the Australian command.\n\nTakenaga's unit were held in Aitape for around one month, before being broken up and sent to prison camps in Lae and in Australia, where they received good treatment. They were all interrogated, and in particular, Lieutenant Colonel Takenaga was transported to Manila for a detailed interrogation. As well as giving character information about the commanders of the 18th Army, Takenaga gave his opinion of how the Allies should deal with Emperor Hirohito: \"If the Emperor is killed then the Japanese people will resist until the bitter end, but if there is an order from the Emperor then they will probably surrender peacefully.\" In preparation for interrogation, the soldiers in Takenaga's unit had invented false personal and unit names before their surrender, but from documents seized in Wewak District the Australian Army recognised these as falsehoods. Some of the prisoners also helped with translation of seized documents and with propaganda broadcasts urging the Japanese Army to surrender.\n\nAfter Takenaga's surrender, the 18th Army continued to fight in New Guinea until the end of the war on 15 August 1945. To replace Takenaga's unit, the 2nd Battalion of the 239th Infantry Regiment was reformed with new members. However, in August 1945, right before the end of the war, two companies from the reformed 2nd Battalion successively surrendered to the Australians. According to Australian Army records, 12 soldiers and their captain were captured on 10 August, and 16 soldiers and their captain were captured on 11 August. The reasons are said to include the Australian Army's solicitation for the Japanese forces' surrender, the precedent set by Takenaga's unit, and the fact that they had been ordered to defend their positions to the death. The survival rate of the 18th Army after the Battle of Driniumor River was only 25%, a figure significantly lower than the figure of 84% for Takenaga's unit (of the 50 who survived Driniumor, 42 went on to survive the war).\n\nThe surrender of Takenaga's unit was seen as an extremely dishonourable act by the Japanese Army. Upon learning of it, Lieutenant General Adachi strongly reprimanded the commanders of the 41st Division, and prayed to the emperor, while shedding tears, apologising for his lack of virtue. Even after the war, Takenaga was mostly considered a disgrace, and it was a long time before any light was shone on the Takenaga incident. While Takenaga's surrender was recorded in \"Dai Yonjūichi Nyū Ginia Sakusenshi\" (History of the 41st Division's New Guinea Operation), compiled by people associated with the 41st Division, and in \"Senshi Sōsho\", a military history of the Pacific War published by the Japanese Defense Agency, there were also histories that recorded the event as though Takenaga's unit had been wiped out. Awareness of the incident gradually increased after the publication of Fumio Takahashi's article in 1986, but even as of 2009 there were still military personnel who denied that the surrender occurred. For example, in an interview for NHK, Masao Horie, who was a staff officer for the 18th Army and a major at the time of the incident, said, \"Up until now I have never heard of anything like a surrender, and I believe that there were no soldiers who surrendered. If it's true that there was a commander who surrendered, then it is a shame.\"\n\nThe former members of Takenaga's unit were repatriated at the end of the war, along with prisoners from other units. Many of them did not join veterans' associations, did not take any interviews, and lived the rest of their lives quietly. Takenaga worked as a private labourer, and died of illness in 1967. He did not suffer any particular discrimination from his former classmates in the Imperial Japanese Army Academy, and they attended his funeral.\n\n"}

The proposal for building the Petruzzelli was accepted and, on 29 January 1896, a contract was signed between the family and the city administration. Two years later, in October 1898, work began and it ended in 1903. \n\nThe interior of the theatre was painted by Raffaele Armenise. On completion the Teatro Petruzzelli overtook the Teatro Comunale of Corato as the largest theatre of Apulia. The theatre was inaugurated on Saturday, 14 February 1903 with Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots\". \n\nIn the 1980s, the theatre hosted two major operatic debuts, that of \"Iphigénie en Tauride\" by Niccolò Piccinni which had never been presented after its debut in Paris in 1779, and the Neapolitan version of Bellini's \"I Puritani\", which was written for Maria Malibran but was never performed by her. Both events contributed to making the city world famous. \n\nIn addition to operas, ballets and big concerts were presented. Many great international artists have performed at the Petruzzelli: these include Tito Schipa, Herbert von Karajan, Rudolf Nureyev, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Liza Minnelli, Juliette Gréco. Great Italian artists include Eduardo De Filippo, Riccardo Muti, Carla Fracci, Luciano Pavarotti, Piero Cappuccilli and Giorgio Gaber. \n\nThe Petruzzelli also hosted important concerts of light music (among others concerts by Paolo Conte and Ornella Vanoni) and it was the headquarters of \"Azzurro\", a musical programme, for almost all of the 1980s. The interior was also used as a location by directors such as Franco Zeffirelli and Alberto Sordi, whose \"Polvere di stelle\" was shot there.\n\nDuring the night of 26 and 27 October 1991 the theatre was completely destroyed by fire, the result of arson. The last opera presented was \"Norma\". \nThe criminal trial of those accused of setting the fire ended with the acquittal of the defendants and the condemnation of the perpetrators of the incident. \n\nA civil action followed which involved the Messeni Nemagna family and temporary manager Fernando Pinto, who was accused of failing to insure the theatre, ended with his conviction and the order to pay compensation of 57 billion lire in favour of the owners of the theatre. On 21 November 2002 the Ministry for Heritage and Cultural Activities signed a \"Protocol of Understanding\" between the family that owned the theatre and the City, the Province of Bari and the Apulia Region, stating that the theatre would be rebuilt by 22 November 2006. \n\nHowever, since the work of reconstruction never started, on 3 October 2006 the Theatre become the property of the Municipality of Bari in accordance with an Article related to the Finance Act of 2006. But on 30 April 2008 the Constitutional Court, in its decision No. 128/2008\nordered that the Theatre be given back to the Messeni Nemagna family. \n\nThe Petruzzelli, reconstructed entirely with public money in 2008, was returned to the City of Bari on 7 September 2009 for breach of article 5 of the contract dated 29 January 1896 between the City of Bari and Antonio Onofrio and Petruzzelli. The article stated: \"In the event that the building collapses because of an earthquake, fire or for any other cause, the grantee and its successors would have the right to rebuild the Politeama to its original state, provided that the work was undertaken within a year and be completed in three years from the date on which the collapse has occurred, or have a duty to clear the land and leave it free of debris and return it to the City within a year counting from the above term.\" \n\nThe Fondazione Lirico Sinfonica Petruzzelli e Teatri di Bari was eventually identified as the only entity able to assume the management, maintenance and insurance of the Teatro Petruzzelli, based on what was written in former Article 23 of Law 800, which states that municipalities must make theatres available for opera companies after the end of concert seasons. The Teatro Petruzzelli officially reopened Sunday 4 October 2009, nearly 18 years after the fire, with a performance of the Ninth Symphony by Ludwig van Beethoven by the Orchestra of the Province of Bari, conducted by Fabio Mastrangelo. \n\nOn 6 December 2009 the first opera season in the re-built theatre began with \"Turandot\" by Giacomo Puccini, directed by Roberto De Simone, the orchestral under the direction of Maestro Renato Palumbo.\n\nDue to the economic situation in Italy, it was announced that the opera house has cancelled its October and November 2014 presentations.\n\nNotes\n"}

It is a day to live simply and off grid, enjoy the nature around you and breathe fresh air. Unplug your TV, computers... and take a walk. The campaign focuses primarily on America because of massively high per capita consumption in the US.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the UNPLUG from Mother Earth Campaign was initiated by three Indigenous-based organizations. These organizations and leaders were Tom B.K. Goldtooth, Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN); Winona LaDuke, Indigenous Women's Network (IWN)and Christopher Peters, 7th Generation Fund (SGF). Nilak Butler (deceased), member of IEN and IWN also assisted in the development of this UNPLUG Campaign during the 1990s in her capacity as an Indigenous staff organizer within the Indigenous Nuclear Free Campaign of U.S. Greenpeace. Periodically throughout the 1990s and 2000s the UNPLUG from Mother Earth Campaign was initiated by these organizations, expanding to include other organizations such as Honor The Earth and White Earth Land Recovery Project. There is no ownership of the concept of this campaign. It has been the principle of IEN, IWN and SGF for people of the United States, Canada, other industrialized countries and of the world to adopt this campaign.\n\n\n"}

In A.H. 82 (701-702) al-Muhallab's son Mughirah died and al-Muhallab sent Yazid to replace him. Soon afterwards al-Muhallab died and al-Hajjaj appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan. There Yazid confronted external and internal enemies, including some rebels entering his province who were supporters of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath. Yazid defeated them. Yazid seized Nizak's fortress and made peace with him.\n\nIn A.H. 85 (704-705) al-Hajjaj replaced Yazid naming his younger brother al-Mufaddal governor of Khurasan. Various reasons are suggested, including that al-Hajjaj encountered a prophecy that his successor would be named Yazid and al-Hajjaj considered this Yazid the only one threatening enough to worry about. Al-Hajjaj imprisoned and tortured Yazid. In A.H. 90 (708-709) Yazid disguised escaped and made his way to Palestine where he was granted refuge by Suleiman ibn Abd al-Malik. Al-Hajjaj pressed Caliph al-Walid I who commanded his brother to send him Yazid in chains. Suleiman had his own son chained to Yazid approach the caliph and speak favouring Yazid's safety. Al-Walid accepted this and told al-Hajjaj to desist. Yazid returned to Suleiman and the two were very close to each other.\n\nWhen Suleiman came to the throne in A.H. 96 (715), he appointed Yazid to govern Iraq. The next year Suleiman appointed Yazid governor of Khurasan. Yazid fought in Jurjan and Tabaristan, personally engaging in combat. In A.H. 99 (717-718) the new caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz dismissed Yazid due to his tortures against people of conquered territories, especially Turks and Sogds. Yazid was captured on his way to Basra and brought before Umar who intensely disliked him. Umar imprisoned Yazid. In A.H. 101 (719-720) when Umar fell ill, Yazid escaped. Umar died.\n\nYazid approached Basra. Many joined him. He refused to swear allegiance to the new caliph, Yazid II. He attacked those holding his brothers, defeated them and freed his brothers. His son Khalid was arrested in Kufah and sent to Damascus where he remained in prison until he died. Yazid was advised to head east, but he declined to follow this advice. In A.H. 102 (720-721) Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik and al-Abbas ibn al-Walid led forces against him. On August 25, Maslamah's troops advanced to battle, frightening some of Yazid's men who fled. Yazid had these beheaded. He then rode directly at Maslamah. Maslamah's cavalry intercepted him and cut him down.\n\nFighting continued. In Wasit, Yazid's son Mu'awiyah on news of his father's death executed some prisoners, including Adi ibn Artat, the Basran governor who had sent Yazid to Umar in A.H. 99. Mu'awiyah and other surviving members of the Yazid's family sailed to Bahrayn, then near Kirman. They advanced to Qandabil where they were denied entrance. There was a glorious fight in which all but two died, those two making their way to Zabulistan. Some captured boys were sent to Yazid II who beheaded them.\n\n\n"}
