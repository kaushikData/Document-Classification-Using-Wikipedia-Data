It happened on December 5, 2001 when a U.S. soldier responsible for calling in airstrikes accidentally misguided the Boeing B-52 bomber to strike a hill held by American Special Forces and dozens of their Afghan allies.\n\nTwo days earlier, Captain (now Lieutenant Colonel) Jason Amerine and Afghan tribal leader Hamid Karzai fought for the vital Arghandab town of Sayyd Alma Kalay. The Taliban withdrew from the town, and Amerine and Karzai entered the town. After both talked in the headquarters, Amerine left to discuss further airstrikes with another officer. While studying a map, a huge explosion hit the hill near them, apparently from one of their own bombs. Amerine was wounded, while many on the hill were killed or also wounded. A military investigation revealed that one of the men from the headquarters in Sayyd Alma Kalay who arrived earlier in the day made a mistake: he was on the ground calling in airstrikes when he accidentally gave the wrong coordinates for a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress that dropped the 2,000 lb bomb on the hill on which several Americans and Afghans were proposed.\n\nThree of Amerine's friends died:\n\n\n10 Afghans died as well. Forty Afghans and Americans, including Amerine, were wounded. The wounded were taken to Ramstein Air Base in Germany for treatment.\n\n"}
{"id": "2449031", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2449031", "title": "2003 Italy blackout", "text": "2003 Italy blackout\n\nThe 2003 Italy blackout was a serious power outage that affected all of italian peninsula for 12 hours and part of Switzerland near Geneva for 3 hours on 28 September 2003. It was the largest blackout in the series of blackouts in 2003, involving about 56 million people.\n\nPower went off at about 03:20 hrs. local time on 28 September 2003. Initial reports from Italy's electricity supplier, ENEL, stated that the power line which supplied electricity to Italy from Switzerland was damaged by storms, causing it to trip and also the two 400 kV power lines between France and Italy to trip due to sudden increased demand from those two power lines. Later, it has been shown that the trip of the first line from Switzerland - the so-called \"Lukmanier\" line - was caused by a tree flashover. The trigger of the Italian blackout was a sluggish trimming of bushes and trees below HV overhead lines.\n\nThe cascading effect disrupted power flow to Italy from the two main exporting coutries France and Switzerland. ENEL lost control of the grid in the next 4 seconds, with the lines to neighbouring countries tripped one by one amid the cascading effect. Swiss electricity company ATEL later concurred that a power line between Switzerland and Italy went out for a few hours.\n\nFrequency dropped down to 49 Hz, due to the loss of import power. Within the next 2,5 minutes, frequency went further down until the under-frequency threshold of 47,5 Hz was hit and all generators were tripped according to the under-frequency protection settings. The reason for the blackout was that during this phase the under-voltage load shedding (UVLS) could not compensate the additional loss of generation, when ca. 7,5 GW of distributed power plants tripped during under-frequency operation (cf. figure \"Frequency behaviour in Italy in the transitory period\", UCTE report, April 2004, p. 115).\n\nThe night of 27 September 2003 is the night of the annual overnight Nuit Blanche in Rome, the capital of Italy. Thus, many people were on the streets and all public transportation were still operating at the time of the blackout (at about 3:00 on 28 September 2003) despite the fact that it was very late at night. The blackout caused the carnival to end early. Several hundred people were trapped in underground trains. Coupled with heavy rain at the time, many people spent the night sleeping in train stations and on streets in Rome.\n\nThroughout Italy, 110 trains were cancelled, with 30,000 people stranded on trains in the railway network. All flights in Italy were also cancelled. Police described the scene as chaos but there were no serious accidents.\n\nThe blackout did not spread further to neighbouring countries, such as Austria, Slovenia and Croatia, which are connected to Italy. Only part of the Geneva Canton of Switzerland suffered a power outage for three hours.\n\nAfter three hours, energy was restored in northern regions. Electricity was restored gradually in most places, and in most cities electricity was powered on again during the morning. Rolling blackouts continued to affect about 5% of the population on the next two days (29–30 September) as the electricity company ENEL continued its effort to restore supply.\n\nThe final report of the investigation committee on the 28 September 2003 blackout in Italy was published in April 2004 by UCTE.\n\nResearchers in physics and complex networks have modelled the 2003 Italy blackout as a cascade of failures in interdependent networks. Several nodes in the network of power stations failed, causing a failure of the Internet communication network, which in turn caused a further breakdown of power stations. The goal of research was to understand how to build more robust networks.\n\n"}

Saudi Arabia and other countries have criticized Al Jazeera and Qatar's relations with Iran. Qatar claims that it has assisted the United States in the War on Terror and the ongoing military intervention against ISIL.\n\nInitial supply disruptions were mitigated by additional imports from Iran and Turkey, and Qatar did not agree to any of the Saudi-led coalition's demands. The demands included reducing diplomatic relations with Iran, stopping military coordination with Turkey, and closing Al-Jazeera.\n\nOn 27 July 2017, Qatari foreign minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told reporters that Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain were showing \"stubbornness\" to Qatar and had not taken any steps to solve the crisis. Al Thani added that the Security Council, the General Assembly and \"all the United Nations mechanisms\" could play a role in resolving the situation. On 24 August 2017, Qatar announced that they would restore full diplomatic relations with Iran.\n\nSince he took power in 1995, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani believed Qatar could find security only by transforming itself from a Saudi appendage to a rival of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia withdrew its ambassador to Doha from 2002 to 2008 to try to pressure Qatar to curb its individualistic tendencies. This approach broadly failed. The Arab Spring left a power vacuum which both Saudi Arabia and Qatar sought to fill, with Qatar being supportive of the revolutionary wave and Saudi Arabia opposing it; since both states are allies of the United States, they avoid direct conflict with one another. Qatar has had differences with other Arab governments on a number of issues: it broadcasts Al Jazeera; it is accused of maintaining good relations with Iran; and it has supported the Muslim Brotherhood in the past. Qatar has been accused of sponsoring terrorism. Some countries have faulted Qatar for funding rebel groups in Syria, including al-Qaeda’s affiliate in Syria, the al-Nusra Front, although the Saudis have done the same. Qatar has allowed the Afghan Taliban to set up a political office inside the country. Qatar is a close ally of the United States, hosting the largest American base in the Middle East, Al Udeid Air Base.\n\nThe exact reasons for the diplomatic break-offs are unclear, but contemporary news coverage primarily attributes this to several events in April and May 2017.\n\nIn April 2017, Qatar was involved in a deal with both Sunni and Shi'ite militants in Iraq and Syria. The deal had two goals. The immediate goal was to secure the return of 26 Qatari hostages (including Qatari royals) who had been kidnapped by Shi'ite militants while falcon hunting in Southern Iraq and kept in captivity for more than 16 months. The second goal was to get both Sunni and Shi'ite militants in Syria to allow humanitarian aid to pass through and allow the safe evacuation of civilians. According to the \"New York Times\", this deal allowed the evacuation of at least 2,000 civilians from the Syrian village of Madaya alone. What outraged Saudi Arabia and the UAE is the amount of money Qatar had to pay to secure the deal. According to the \"Financial Times\" Qatar paid $700 million to Iranian-backed Shi'a militias in Iraq, $120–140 million to Tahrir al-Sham, and $80 million to Ahrar al-Sham.\n\nAs part of the Riyadh Summit in late May 2017, many world leaders, including US President Donald Trump visited the region. Trump gave strong support for Saudi Arabia's efforts in fighting against states and groups allied with Iran and the Muslim Brotherhood, leading to an arms deal between the countries. The \"Business Insider\" reported that \"Elliott Broidy a top fundraiser for President Donald Trump; and George Nader, Broidy's business partner ... pushed for anti-Qatar policies at the highest levels of government, and expected large consulting contracts from Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\" Trump's support may have induced other Sunni states to fall in line with Saudi Arabia to take a stance against Qatar. Trump's public support for Saudi Arabia emboldened the kingdom and sent a chill through other Gulf states, including Oman and Kuwait, that fear that any country that defies the Saudis or the United Arab Emirates could face ostracism as Qatar has. The Saudi-led move was at once an opportunity for the GCC partners and Egypt to punish their adversaries in Doha, please their allies in Washington, and remove attention from their own shortcomings and challenges.\n\nAccording to Qatar-based Al Jazeera and the American FBI, the Qatar News Agency website and other government media platforms were hacked in May 2017, where hackers posted fake remarks on the official Qatar News Agency attributed to the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, that expressed support for Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and Israel. The emir was quoted as saying: \"Iran represents a regional and Islamic power that cannot be ignored and it is unwise to face up against it. It is a big power in the stabilization of the region.\" Qatar reported that the statements were false and did not know their origin. Despite this, the remarks were widely publicized in the various Arab news media, including UAE-based Sky News Arabia and Saudi-owned Al Arabiya. On 3 June 2017, the Twitter account of Bahraini foreign minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa was hacked.\n\nInitially alleged intelligence gathered by the US security agencies indicated that Russian hackers were behind the intrusion first reported by the Qataris. However, a US official briefed on the inquiry told the \"New York Times\" that it \"was unclear whether the hackers were state-sponsored\" and \"The Guardian\" diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour reported that \"it is believed that the Russian government was not involved in the hacks; instead, freelance hackers were paid to undertake the work on behalf of some other state or individual.\" A US diplomat said that Russia and its ally Iran stood to benefit from sowing discord among US allies in the region, \"particularly if they made it more difficult for the United States to use Qatar as a major base.\" The FBI sent a team of investigators to Doha to help the Qatari government investigate the hacking incident. Later, the \"New York Times\" reported that the hacking incidents may be part of a long-running cyberwar between Qatar and other Gulf countries that was only revealed to the public during the recent incidents, and they noted how Saudi and UAE media picked up the statement made by the hacked media in less than 20 minutes and began interviewing many well-prepared commentators against Qatar.\n\nUS intelligence agencies believe that the hacking was done by the United Arab Emirates, according to a \"Washington Post\" article published on 16 July. The intelligence officials stated that the hacking was discussed among Emirati officials on 23 May, one day before the operation took place. The UAE denied any involvement in the hacking. It was announced on 26 August 2017, that five individuals allegedly involved in the hacking were arrested in Turkey.\n\nIn May 2017, the email account of the UAE's ambassador to the US, Yousef Al-Otaiba, was hacked. The emails were reported as \"embarrassing\" by Al Jazeera, because they showed links between the UAE and the US neocon Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Arab countries saw the media coverage of the alleged email hack as a provocation by Qatar, regardless of the lack of affiliation of Qatar to the hack, and deepened the rift between the two sides. On 9 June, Al Jazeera's media network was the victim of a cyber attack across all its platforms. Yousef al-Otaiba has been reportedly linked to buy influence for UAE-led campaigns in the White House.\n\nBetween 5 and 6 June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Egypt, the Maldives, and Bahrain all separately announced that they were cutting diplomatic ties with Qatar; among these Bahrain was the first to announce the severing of ties at 02:50 GMT in the early morning of 5 June.\n\nA variety of diplomatic actions were taken. Saudi Arabia and the UAE notified ports and shipping agents not to receive Qatari vessels or ships owned by Qatari companies or individuals. Saudi Arabia closed the border with Qatar. Saudi Arabia restricted its airspace to Qatar Airways. Instead, Qatar was forced to reroute flights to Africa and Europe through Iranian airspace. Saudi Arabia's central bank advised banks not to trade with Qatari banks in Qatari riyals.\n\nQatar verbally criticized the ban. The Foreign Ministry of Qatar criticized the ban, arguing that it undermined Qatar's sovereignty. The foreign minister of Qatar, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, said that Saudi statements regarding Qatar were contradictory: on the one hand, Saudi Arabia claimed Qatar was supporting Iran, on the other hand, it claimed Qatar was funding Sunni extremists fighting against Iran.\n\nSaudi Arabia's move was welcomed by United States president Donald Trump despite a large US presence at the Al Udeid Air Base, the primary base of US air operations against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. However, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis worked on de-escalating the situation. Tillerson, as the CEO of ExxonMobil, was acquainted with the current and previous emirs of Qatar. A number of countries in the region, including Turkey, Russia and Iran, called for the crisis to be resolved through peaceful negotiations.\n\nAll GCC countries involved in the announcement ordered their citizens out of Qatar. Three Gulf states (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain) gave Qatari visitors and residents two weeks to leave their countries.<ref name=\"dawn/5june2017\"></ref> The foreign ministries of Bahrain and Egypt gave Qatari diplomats 48 hours to leave their countries. Qatar was expelled from the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen and Yemen's government itself has cut ties. Kuwait and Oman remained neutral.\n\nKuwaiti mediators in Riyadh were presented with a list of Saudi demands of Qatar. These included cutting off all links with Iran and expelling resident members of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, shutting down the controversial Al-Jazeera network, to stop \"interfering\" in foreign countries' affairs and to cease any funding or support for terrorist organisations.\n\nAs of 27 November 2018, seven sovereign governments have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar. \nThe Tobruk-based government of Libya claimed to have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar despite having no diplomatic representation in that country.\n\nThe semi-autonomous Somali regions of Puntland,\nHirshabelle, and Galmudug each issued statements cutting ties with Qatar, in opposition to the neutral stance of the federal government of Somalia.\n\nAs of 23 August 2017, three countries have downgraded diplomatic ties with Qatar without fully cutting relations. \n\n\nOther countries made statements condemning Qatar, including Gabon and Eritrea.\nMultiple countries, the European Union and the United Nations called for resolution of the diplomatic crisis through dialogue:\nHassan al-Thawadi, secretary general of the Qatar World Cup supreme committee, has stated that the projects are going as scheduled for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Qatar's only land border and air and sea routes have been cut off by Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As the blockade came into play, World Cup organizers were asked to investigate a \"Plan B\", FIFA however has confidence in not exploring a \"Plan B\" for an alternate 2022 host. According to Thawadi, all these logistical obstacles are being overcome and building progress is continuing with only minimal cost increases, in preparation for the first World Cup in the Middle East.\n\nIsrael's defence minister, Avigdor Lieberman, described the situation as an \"opportunity\" for Israel, stating, \"Some [Arab countries'] interests overlap with Israeli interests, including the issue with al-Jazeera.\" He went on to describe al-Jazeera as an \"incitement machine\" and \"pure propaganda\". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded al-Jazeera shut down its offices in Israel.\n\nReports that Mauritius had cut ties with Qatar were refuted by the Mauritian government. A report in the \"Saudi Gazette\" incorrectly stated that Mauritius had broken off ties with Qatar and that Mauritius' Vice Prime-Minister had issued a communiqué pledging his country's support for Saudi Arabia. This prompted further erroneous reports by other outlets. However, Mauritian Vice Prime Minister Showkutally Soodhun in an interview with Le Défi Media Group of Mauritius refuted claims that he had issued any such communiqué, and Mauritius' Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement that Mauritius continued to maintain diplomatic relations with Qatar.\n\nPakistan stated that it had no plans to cut diplomatic relations with Qatar. Members of the Parliament passed a resolution in National Assembly of Pakistan urging all countries to \"show restraint and resolve their differences through dialogue\". Federal minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources said that \"Pakistan will continue to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar.\" A six-member Qatari delegation headed by a special envoy of the Qatari Emir visited Pakistan and asked Pakistan to play a positive role in resolving the diplomatic crisis. Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif said \"Pakistan would do \"all it can\" to help resolve the crisis and called on the Muslim world to play a role in ending hostilities.\" TRT in a report said that Pakistan would deploy 20,000 troops in Qatar but the Pakistani foreign ministry denied the report.\n\nThe Philippines suspended the deployment of migrant workers to Qatar on 6 June 2017. However,the next day, they allowed the deployment of returning workers and those with an Overseas Employment Certificate, but still maintained the suspension of the deployment of new workers. The suspension was later fully lifted on 15 June.\nUnited States President Donald Trump claimed credit for engineering the diplomatic crisis in a series of tweets. On 6 June, Trump began by tweeting: \"During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar – look!\" An hour and a half later, he remarked on Twitter that it was \"good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism!\" This was in contrast to attempts by the Pentagon and the Department of State to remain neutral. The Pentagon praised Qatar for hosting the Al Udeid Air Base and for its \"enduring commitment to regional security.\" US Ambassador to Qatar, Dana Shell Smith, sent a similar message. Earlier, the US Secretary of State had taken a neutral stance and called for dialogue. On 8 June, President Donald Trump, during a phone call with the Emir of Qatar Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, offered to act as a mediator in the conflict with a White House meeting between the parties if necessary. The offer was declined, and a Qatari official stated, \"The emir has no plans to leave Qatar while the country is under a blockade.\" On 9 June, Trump once again put the blame on Qatar, calling the blockade \"hard but necessary\" while claiming that Qatar had been funding terrorism at a \"very high level\" and described the country as having an \"extremist ideology in terms of funding\". This statement was in conflict with Secretary of State Tillerson's comments on the same day, which called on Gulf states to ease the blockade. In 13 June 2017 after meeting with Tillerson in Washington, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir stated that there was \"no blockade\" and \"what we have done is we have denied them use of our airspace, and this is our sovereign right\" and that the King Salman Centre for Humanitarian Aid and Relief would send food or medical aid to Qatar if needed. On 21 June 2017, Trump told a crowd in Iowa that \"We cannot let these incredibly rich nations fund radical Islamic terror or terrorism of any kind,\" noting that after his visit to Riyadh in May 2017 to meet with Saudi King Salman and urge an end to terror funding, \"He has taken it to heart. And now they're fighting with other countries that have been funding terrorism. And I think we had a huge impact.\"\n\nOn 8 June 2017, Egypt's deputy UN Ambassador Ihab Moustafa called for the United Nations Security Council to launch an investigation into accusations that Qatar \"paid up to $1 billion to a terrorist group active in Iraq\" to free 26 Qatari hostages, including members of its royal family, which payment would violate UN resolutions. The Qataris were kidnapped on 16 December 2015 from a desert camp for falcon hunters in southern Iraq. The hostages were released eighteen months later in April 2017. Qatari diplomats responded to the Egyptian calls for an investigation by reaffirming their commitment to the UN resolutions towards eliminating the financing of terrorism.\n\nIn June 2017, the government of Qatar hired American attorney and politician John Ashcroft to lobby on its behalf and help the state deny international allegations of supporting terror.\n\nOn 24 November 2017, UAE's head of security, Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan, blamed the 2017 Sinai attack on Al-Jazeera's reporting and called for the bombing of Al-Jazeera's headquarters by the Saudi-led coalition.\n\nOn 6 June 2017, Emirates Post of UAE, halted postal services to Qatar.\n\nNearly 80 percent of Qatar's food requirements come from Gulf Arab neighbors, with only 1 percent being produced domestically and even imports from outside the Gulf states usually crossing the now closed land border with Saudi Arabia. Immediately after the cutting of relations, local reports indicated residents swarmed grocery stores in hopes of stockpiling food. Many food delivery trucks were idled along the Saudi-Qatari border. On 8 June 2017, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said, \"We're not worried about a food shortage, we're fine. We can live forever like this, we are well prepared.\" Qatar has been in talks with both Turkey and Iran to secure supply of water and food. On 11 June 2017, Iran sent four cargo planes with fruit and vegetables and promised to continue the supply. Turkey has pledged food and water supplies to go along with their troop deployment at their Turkish military base in Qatar.\n\nAs part of the Qatari government's response to lost food imports, it provided support to domestic agricultural company Baladna, which built a new dairy farm with imported cattle that was planned to produce enough milk to fulfill domestic demand for dairy products by June 2018.\n\nAll airlines based in these countries, including Emirates, suspended flights to and from Qatar. Gulf Air, EgyptAir, FlyDubai, Air Arabia, Saudi Arabian Airlines and Etihad Airways suspended their flights to and from Qatar.<ref name=\"aljazeera/5june2017\"></ref> Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates are also banning overflights by aircraft registered in Qatar (A7). Instead Qatar has rerouted flights to Africa and Europe via Iran, paying a “hefty” overflight fee for each such flight.\n\nQatar Airways in response also suspended its flight operations to Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Bahrain.\n\nPakistan International Airlines sent special flights to bring back over 200 Pakistani pilgrims stuck at Doha airport. Over 550 Pakistani pilgrims in Doha were subsequently flown to Muscat.\n\nPrivate jet travel is also being impacted by the crisis. Business aviation officials said private flights between Qatar and the countries that cut diplomatic ties now need to make a technical stop in a third country. Aircraft registered in Qatar cannot fly to the countries that cut diplomatic ties and vice versa. While business jet operators can request a nonstop routing, two officials said requests so far have been turned down necessitating a stop in a third country.\n\nDue to the blockade of Qatar Airways from the airspace of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, Oman Air has taken up a significant role transporting travelers from and to Doha, mostly through Iranian airspace, while still allowing Qatar passport holders to book flights. The travel embargo has had a significant impact on foreign nationals living and working in Qatar, with about 100,000 Egyptians and citizens from other countries stranded there, unable to book direct flights or obtain travel documents for their return. Per request from Qatar, the blockade was under review by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a UN-agency seeking \"consensus-based solutions\" for the resolution of the crisis.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, the agency asserted its neutrality in the conflict and announced that Qatar Airways will have access to three contingency routes over international waters in early August based on a preliminary agreement reached with the Saudi aviation authority (GACA) early that month. The ICAO, based in Montréal, also reminded all member countries to comply with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and its addenda.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates banned Qatar-flagged ships from calling at Fujairah. It also banned vessels from Qatar from the port and vessels at the port from sailing directly to Qatar. Similar restrictions were put in place at Jebel Ali, which pre-boycott used to handle over 85% of shipborne cargo for Qatar. Bahrain, Egypt and Saudi Arabia also banned Qatar-flagged ships from their ports.\n\nOn 8 June 2017 shipping giant Maersk was unable to transport in or out of Qatar entirely. Due to Qatar's shallow ports, large cargo ships are required to dock at Jebel Ali or other nearby ports where a feeder service transports the goods into Qatar. In response, Maersk and also Swiss-based MSC vessels for Qatar were rerouted to Salalah and Sohar in Oman. Particularly smaller shipments of perishable and frozen foods have taken that route.\n\nOn 12 June 2017, Chinese shipping company COSCO announced suspension of services to and from Qatar. Taiwan's Evergreen Marine and Hong Kong's Orient Overseas Container Line have already suspended services.\n\nHamad Saif al-Shamsi, the Attorney-General of the United Arab Emirates announced on 7 June that publishing expressions of sympathy towards Qatar through social media, or any type of written, visual or verbal form is considered illegal under UAE's Federal Penal Code and the Federal law on Combating Information Technology Crimes. Violators of this offense face between 3 and 15 years imprisonment, a fine of up to 500,000 emirati dirhams ($136,000) or both. Bahrain also issued a similar statement with a penalty up to 5 years imprisonment and a fine.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, and the UAE all blocked access to Qatari news agencies, including the controversial Qatar-based Al Jazeera. Saudi Arabia shut down the local office of Al Jazeera Media Network.<ref name=\"aljazeera1/6june2017\"></ref> The BBC speculated that changes to Al-Jazeera would be a necessary part of any peaceful resolution.\n\nThe Qatar-based beIN Sports channels were also initially banned in June in the UAE. Over a month later, the UAE restored normal access to beIN Sports channels via its local telecom providers. In Saudi Arabia, the channels remain banned, while a large-scale signal piracy operation known as \"beoutQ\" has made the channels' content available.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it was too soon to judge the economic impact of the diplomatic crisis. Standard & Poor's downgraded Qatar's debt by one notch from AA to AA-. Qatar's stock market dropped 7.3% on the first day of the crisis, and reached a 9.7% drop by 8 June.\n\nAs per S&P Global Ratings, banks in Qatar are strong enough to survive a withdrawal of all Gulf country deposits.\n\nQatar is a global leader in liquefied natural gas production. Despite the severing of ties, Qatari natural gas continues to flow to the UAE and Oman through Abu Dhabi based Dolphin Energy's pipeline. The pipeline meets about 30–40 percent of UAE's energy needs. Shipping constraints from the crisis have also rerouted multiple shipments of oil and gas to and from the Gulf, which has caused reverberations in many local energy markets. \nOn 8 June 2017, gas futures spiked nearly 4 percent in the United Kingdom, which had nearly a third of all its imported gas arriving from Qatar. A secondary effect of the dispute has been on worldwide supplies of helium, which is often extracted from natural gas. Qatar is the world's second largest supplier of helium (the US ranks first).\n\nThe 23rd Arabian Gulf Cup was scheduled to be hosted in Qatar. In November 2017, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain pulled out of the Gulf Cup due to the Qatar boycott. On 7 December 2017, it was announced that Kuwait will host the tournament after Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain all withdrew because of the diplomatic crisis.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the Turkish parliament passed, with 240 votes in favour and 98 against, a legislative act first drafted in May allowing Turkish troops to be deployed to a Turkish military base in Qatar. On 13 June 2017, during a speech, President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan condemned the boycott of Qatar as \"inhumane and against Islamic values\" and stated that \"victimising Qatar through smear campaigns serves no purpose\". On 23 June 2017, Turkey rejected demands to shut down its military base in Qatar.\nQatar hosts about 10,000 US troops at Al Udeid Air Base, which houses the forward operating base of United States Central Command that plays a commanding role in US airstrikes in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A Pentagon spokesperson claimed the diplomatic crisis would not affect the US military posture in Qatar.\n\nOn 30 January 2018 an inaugural United States-Qatar Strategic Dialogue meeting was held, co-chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State for Defence Affairs Khalid al-Attiyah and Qatari Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. The meeting expressed the need for an immediate resolution of the crisis which respects Qatar’s sovereignty. In a Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation, the United States expressed its readiness to deter and confront any external threat to Qatar’s territorial integrity. Qatar offered to help fund the expansion of facilities at US bases in Qatar.\n\nOn 25 March 2018, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) officially denied rumours that the Incirlik Air Base in Turkey and the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar will be closed due to the ongoing regional conflict.\n\nIn January 2018, Qatar's ambassador was in talks with Russia with the intent to purchase S-400 surface-to-air missiles. Both countries signed an agreement on military and technical cooperation in 2017. In May 2018, the French daily newspaper \"Le Monde\" reported that King Salman of Saudi Arabia would take military action if Qatar installed the Russian air defence system. However, a senior Russian official remarked the system would still be delivered even against the will of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis were themselves approaching Russia to improve economic and military ties in 2017, but talks relating to the arms deal were hindered by concerns the United States and Saudi Arabia had with regard to the Russian position towards Iran's military and strategic involvement in the Middle East.\n\nOn 18 September 2018, Qatar finalised a deal to purchase Eurofighter Typhoon and BAE Hawk aircraft in a deal reported as being worth £5Bn.\n\nOn 22 June 2017, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt and Bahrain issued Qatar a list of 13 demands through Kuwait, which is acting as a mediator, that Qatar should agree in full within 10 days, which expired on 2 July 2017. According to reports on 23 June, these demands included:\n\n\nAccording to a report by the Qatar-owned Al-Jazeera, \"Qatari officials immediately dismissed the document as neither reasonable or actionable.\" Iran denounced the blockade. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said that some of the demands would be very hard to meet but encouraged further dialogue.\n\nOn 3 July, Saudi Arabia accepted a Kuwaiti request for the deadline to be extended by 48 hours.\n\nOn 5 July, foreign ministers from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain met in Cairo after receiving a response from Qatar to their list of demands. The meeting aimed to resolve the dispute ended in a stalemate when Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said that the political and economic boycott of Qatar will remain until it changes its policies. Also on the same day, the Saudi-led bloc said it no longer insisting it to comply with its 13 specific demands they tabled last month.

Tales of black-eyed children have existed since the 1950s.\n\nThe supposed origins of the legend are some 1996 postings written by Texas reporter Brian Bethel on a \"ghost-related mailing list\" relating two alleged encounters with \"black-eyed kids.\" Bethel describes encountering two such children in Abilene, Texas in 1996, and claims that a second person had a similar, unrelated encounter in Portland, Oregon. Bethel's stories have become regarded as classic examples of creepypasta, and gained such popularity that he published a FAQ \"just to keep up with demand for more info about the new urban legend.\" In 2012, Brian Bethel told his story on reality TV series \"Monsters and Mysteries in America\". He wrote a follow-up article for the Abilene Reporter News, describing his experience and maintaining his belief that it was legitimate.\n\nIn 2012, the horror film \"Black Eyed Kids\" was produced with Kickstarter funding, its director commenting that the black eyed children were \"an urban legend that's been floating around on the Internet for years now, I always thought it was fascinating\". A 2013 episode of MSN's \"Weekly Strange\" that featured reports of black eyed children is thought to have helped spread the legend on the internet.\n\nDuring one week in September 2014, the British tabloid \"Daily Star\" ran three sensationalistic front-page stories about alleged sightings of black-eyed children, connected to the sale of a supposedly haunted pub in Staffordshire. The paper claimed a \"shock rise in sightings around the world\". Alleged sightings are taken seriously by ghost hunters, some of whom believe black eyed children to be extraterrestrials, vampires, or ghosts.\n\nScience writer Sharon A. Hill was unable to find any documentation of black-eyed child encounters, concluding that the tales are passed on as \"friend of a friend\" ghost stories. Hill considers the legend to resemble \"typical spooky folklore stories\" such as the phantom black dog, where the subject is not supernatural, and there may never have been an actual original encounter.

{"id": "3554936", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3554936", "title": "Blood sport", "text": "Blood sport\n\nA blood sport is a category of sport or entertainment that involves bloodshed. Common examples of the former include combat sports such as cockfighting and dog fighting and some forms of hunting and fishing. Activities characterized as blood sports, but involving only human participants, include the Ancient Roman gladiatorial games and the modern mixed martial arts (cage fighting).\n\nAccording to Tanner Carson, the earliest use of the term is in reference to mounted hunting, where the quarry would be actively chased, as in fox hunting or hare coursing. Before firearms a hunter using arrows or a spear might also wound an animal, which would then be chased and perhaps killed at close range, as in medieval boar hunting. The term was popularised by author Henry Stephens Salt.\n\nLater, the term seems to have been applied to various kinds of baiting and forced combat: bull-baiting, bear-baiting, cockfighting and later developments such as dog fighting and rat-baiting. The animals were specially bred for fighting. In the Victorian era, social reformers began a vocal opposition to such activities, claiming grounds of ethics, morality and animal welfare.\n\nAnimal rights and animal welfare advocates have sought to extend the term \"blood sport\" to various types of hunting. Trophy hunting and fox hunting in particular have been disparaged as \"blood sports\" by those concerned about animal welfare, animal ethics and conservation.\n\nRecreational fishing has sometimes been described as a blood sport by those within the recreation.\n\nLimitations on blood sports have been enacted in much of the world. Certain blood sports remain legal under varying degrees of control in certain locations (\"e.g.,\" bullfighting and cockfighting) but have declined in popularity elsewhere. Proponents of blood sports are widely cited to believe that they are traditional within the culture. Bullfighting aficionados, for example, do not regard bullfighting as a sport but as a cultural activity. It is sometimes called a tragic spectacle, because in many forms of the event, the bull is invariably killed and the bullfighter is always at risk of death.\n\nMany online video-sharing websites such as YouTube do not allow videos of animal bloodsports to be shown on the site.\nBlood sports have been a common theme in fiction. While historical fiction depicts real-life sports such as gladiatorial games and jousting, speculative fiction, not least dystopic science fiction suggests variants of blood sports in a contemporary or future society. Some popular works themed on blood sports are \"Battle Royale\", \"The Hunger Games\", \"The Running Man\", \"The Long Walk\", \"Fight Club\", \"Death Race 2000\", \"Amores Perros\", and \"The Most Dangerous Game\". Blood sports are also a common setting for video games (\"Unreal Tournament\", \"Street Fighter\" etc.), making up much of the fighting game genre.\n\nDeveloped science fiction universes such as \"Star Wars\" and \"Doctor Who\" feature different blood sports.\n\n\n"}

It redefines Andrew Jackson, America's seventh President, as an Emo rock star and focuses on populism, the Indian Removal Act, and his relationship with his wife Rachel.\n\nThe show opens when the cast, dressed as 19th-century American cowboys and prostitutes take the stage. They are led by Andrew Jackson. They sing about their eagerness to strip the English, Spanish, French, and, most importantly, the Native Americans, of their land in the US. Along with this, they sing of the desire to bring political power back to the public and away from the elite (\"Populism Yea Yea\").\n\nJackson's childhood is shown in the Tennessee hills during the late 18th century. His family and the local shoe cobbler die of cholera and in Indian attacks. This leads him to join the military, where he is imprisoned by the British. Jackson begins to express his disdain for the US government’s lack of involvement with the people of the frontier and how he wishes someone would stand up to them (\"I'm Not That Guy\").\n\nJackson is then shown as a young adult, regaling local tavern goers with his short meeting with George Washington. He is interrupted and attacked by several Spaniards. Jackson defeats them, but is injured in the process. A woman named Rachel helps him to recover from his injuries. They fall in love during his recovery and eventually marry, though Rachel is not yet divorced from her current husband (\"Illness as Metaphor\"). At the end of the song, news comes that British, Indian, and Spanish forces are making advances into American territory. Meanwhile, the US government continues to do nothing to stop the attacks. Jackson realizes that if he wants this cycle to end, he must change things himself (\"I'm So That Guy\").\n\nJackson organizes a militia to remove Indian Tribes throughout the Southeast both by force and negotiation (\"Ten Little Indians\"). In the aftermath of a battle, he adopts a young Native American child named Lyncoya. John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, John Calhoun, and Martin Van Buren are introduced as they express their concern over Jackson's unauthorized territorial expansion. Jackson rebuffs their pleas, explaining how he has driven out the French and the Spanish, while acquiring more land than Thomas Jefferson.\n\nThe Battle of New Orleans transforms Jackson into a national hero. He becomes Governor of Florida and decides to run for United States President in 1824. Although he receives the most popular and Electoral votes, he is not elected President, due to the political maneuvering in the House of Representatives. (\"The Corrupt Bargain\"). Jackson spends the four years after the election at his home, The Hermitage. He returns from political exile and forms the Democratic Party. During the presidential election of 1828, Andrew Jackson becomes a surprise candidate (\"Rock Star\"). This is grueling both publicly and personally to Jackson and his family. Rachel, feeling as if she has no private life, questions Andrew's love for her versus the American People (\"The Great Compromise\").\nDays before the election, a Senate panel led by Clay investigates Jackson's past wrongdoings and accuses Rachel of bigamy. Despite this, Jackson ends up winning the election and becomes the 7th President of the United States. However, the accusation of his rivals, along with the stress of the election, leads to Rachel dying of grief. He vows to use both his presidency and his wife's death as a mandate to \"take this country back\" (\"Public Life\").\n\nOnce in office, Jackson is faced with a plethora of problems, ranging from the National Bank to questions about Indian relocation. Being the “People’s President,” Jackson begins polling the American populace on all executive decisions. This draws the ire of Congress and the Supreme Court. In response, Jackson consolidates Executive Power, thus making the Presidency more powerful than Congress and the Courts. At first, his exhilarating cowboy-like governing tactics are met with great enthusiasm by the average citizen. But, as the problems grow tougher, the public begins to resent being asked to make difficult decisions (\"Crisis Averted\").\n\nAs the American people gradually turn on him, Jackson takes stock of all that he has lost: his family, his wife, and now the love of the American public. He decides he must take ultimate responsibility for the nation's choices and declares that he alone will be the one to make the unenviable policy decisions regarding the Indians' fate (\"The Saddest Song\"). He summons Black Fox—an Indian Chief who organized the remaining Indian tribes into a confederation against Tennessee settlers—in order to make one last deal with the Native Americans still living in American Territories. Jackson implores Black Fox to peacefully move his people west of the Mississippi River. Black Fox asks for time to consult his tribe. But, Jackson violently snaps and decrees that federal troops will forcibly move the Indians West.\n\nNear the end, the musical reviews Jackson's legacy and the views attributed to him. Some believe he was one of America's greatest presidents, while others believe him to be an “American Hitler.” The final scene shows Jackson receiving an honorary doctorate at Harvard. He reflects upon his achievements and his questionable decisions. The show telescopes out and we get a bird's-eye view of Jackson's damning legacy and our collective culpability (\"Second Nature\").\n\nFinally, the company gathers to sing \"The Hunters of Kentucky,\" before taking their bows.\n\nDeveloped by New York-based experimental company Les Freres Corbusier, \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\" had workshop productions in August 2006 at the Williamstown Theatre Festival and in May 2007 at the New 42nd Street Studios, New York.

Despite positive reviews and early Tony buzz, the musical closed on January 2, 2011, after 120 performances.\n\nCritics blamed the poor economy during the show's run and its unorthodox story and presentation for the show's failure to build popularity on Broadway. The show, which cost $4.5 million, \"will close at a loss,\" according to \"The New York Times\".\n\nMaking its Boston debut with the SpeakEasy Stage Company in October 2012, the show was directed by Paul Melone, musical direction Nicholas James Connell, choreography Larry Sousa, fight choreography Angie Jepson, set design Eric Levenson, costume design Elisabetta Polito, lighting design Jeff Adelberg, sound design Eric Norris, stage manager Amy Spalletta and assistant stage manager Katherine Clanton.\n\nThe cast featured Brandon Barbosa (Lyncoya), Samil Battenfeld (Lyncoya), Mary Callanan (Storyteller/Ensemble), Gus Curry (Andrew Jackson), Tom Hamlett (John Quincy Adams/Ensemble), Ryan Halsaver (John Calhoun), Amy Jo Jackson (Ensemble), Michael Levesque (Ensemble), Evan Murphy (Ensemble), Josh Pemberton (Martin Van Buren), Diego Klok Perez (Henry Clay/Black Fox/Ensemble), Ben Rosenblatt (James Monroe), Alessandra Vaganek (Rachel Jackson), and Brittany Walters (Ensemble).\n\nThe first production of the show after its New York run was a non-Equity performance at the University School of Nashville in November, 2011.

SAIO voiced concerns about the use of offensive caricatures of Native people regardless of the satirical style of the show.\n\nRaleigh Little Theatre cancelled their 2015 season's production of \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\" and replaced it with \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\", claiming a lack of support from local members of the Native American community.\n\n\n\"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\" received mostly positive reviews. The \"New York Daily News\" called it \"bloody entertaining\" and Benjamin Walker \"magnetic and energetic\", applauding the show for its lightweight and silly atmosphere. \"The New York Times\" noted that \"there is no show in town that more astutely reflects the state of this nation than \"Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson\".\" Whereas one local critic of the San Francisco production (2012) referred to it as \"an unmistakable exercise in American self-loathing.\"\n\n\"Hamilton\", a 2015 musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda\n\n"}
{"id": "284880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=284880", "title": "Cardiff Giant", "text": "Cardiff Giant\n\nThe Cardiff Giant was one of the most famous hoaxes in American history. It was a purported \"petrified man\" uncovered on October 16, 1869, by workers digging a well behind the barn of William C. \"Stub\" Newell in Cardiff, New York. Both it and an unauthorized copy made by P.T. Barnum are still being displayed.\n\nThe giant was the creation of a New York tobacconist named George Hull. Hull, an atheist, decided to create the giant after an argument at a Methodist revival meeting about Genesis 6:4 which stated that there were giants who once lived on Earth.\n\nThe idea of a petrified man did not originate with Hull, however. During 1858 the newspaper \"Alta California\" had published a bogus letter claiming that a prospector had been petrified when he had drunk a liquid within a geode. Some other newspapers also had published stories of supposedly petrified people.\n\nHull hired men to quarry out a block of gypsum in Fort Dodge, Iowa, telling them it was intended for a monument to Abraham Lincoln in New York. He shipped the block to Chicago, where he hired Edward Burghardt, a German stonecutter, to carve it into the likeness of a man and swore him to secrecy.\n\nVarious stains and acids were used to make the giant appear to be old and weathered, and the giant's surface was beaten with steel knitting needles embedded in a board to simulate pores. During November 1868, Hull transported the giant by railroad to the farm of his cousin, William Newell. By then, he had spent US$2,600 for the hoax (nearly \n, adjusted for inflation).\n\nNearly a year later, Newell hired Gideon Emmons and Henry Nichols, ostensibly to dig a well, and on October 16, 1869 they found the giant. One of the men reportedly exclaimed, \"I declare, some old Indian has been buried here!\"\n\nNewell set up a tent over the giant and charged 25 cents for people who wanted to see it. Two days later he increased the price to 50 cents. People came by the wagonload.\n\nArchaeological scholars pronounced the giant a fake, and some geologists even noticed that there was no good reason to try to dig a well in the exact spot the giant had been found. Yale paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh termed it \"a most decided humbug\". Some theologians and preachers, however, defended its authenticity.\n\nEventually, Hull sold his part-interest for $23,000 () to a syndicate of five men headed by David Hannum. They moved it to Syracuse, New York, for exhibition. The giant drew such crowds that showman P. T. Barnum offered $50,000 for the giant. When the syndicate refused, he hired a man to model the giant's shape covertly in wax and create a plaster replica. He displayed his giant in New York, claiming that his was the real giant, and the Cardiff Giant was a fake.\n\nAs the newspapers reported Barnum's version of the story, David Hannum was quoted as saying, \"There's a sucker born every minute\" in reference to spectators paying to see Barnum's giant. Since then, the quotation has often been misattributed to Barnum himself.\n\nHannum sued Barnum for calling his giant a fake, but the judge told him to get his giant to swear on his own genuineness in court if he wanted a favorable injunction.\n\nOn December 10, 1869, Hull confessed everything to the press, and on February 2, 1870 both giants were revealed as fakes in court; the judge also ruled that Barnum could not be sued for terming a fake giant a fake.\n\nThe Cardiff Giant was displayed at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition, but did not attract much attention.\nIowa publisher Gardner Cowles, Jr. bought it later to adorn his basement rumpus room as a coffee table and conversation piece. In 1947 he sold it to the Farmers' Museum in Cooperstown, New York, where it is still displayed.\n\nThe owner of Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum, a coin-operated game arcade and museum of oddities in Farmington Hills, Michigan, has said that the replica displayed there is Barnum's replica.\n\nA replica of the Giant is displayed at The Fort Museum and Frontier Village in Fort Dodge, Iowa.\n\nThe Cardiff Giant has inspired a number of similar hoaxes. \n\n\n\n\n"}

Global share prices fell an average of 25%, but Australia saw a 40% decline. 17 of the 18 major OECD economies experienced a recession in the early 1990s.\n\nIn the 1980s, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew famously predicted that Australia was at risk of becoming the \"white trash of Asia\" due to high unemployment, inflationary pressures and government debt. At the time of the comments, Bob Hawke was Australia's Prime Minister and he stated that the comment was \"not an overstatement\". The white trash quote is still used today.\n\nIn Australia, the Australian Labor Party Government of Bob Hawke had come to power in 1983. The Hawke-Keating Government shifted the Labor Party from its traditional allegiance to economic protectionism and have moved to deregulate Australia's finance industry restructure the role of trade unions.\n\nIan Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank from 1996 to 2006, has said that the financial excesses of the 1980s were of such a scale that they made the 1990s recession \"inevitable\", describing Australia's economy at the end of the 1980s as overstretched and vulnerable to contractionary shock. The pressure of high interest rates on businesses – many of which were \"borrowed up to the hilt\" – became relentless.\n\nThe debate as to the causes or extent to which international factors and domestic government policy contributed to the severity of the 1990s recession in Australia continues. Speaking in 2006, former Reserve bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said:\n\nThe Hawke Labor Government initially responded to the crisis by asking the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to defer its national wage case. Commodity prices dropped and the Australian dollar sharply declined. The Reserve Bank conducted a $2 billion intervention to hold the dollar at 68c but it crashed to 51c. In December 1987, Keating said that the Australian economy would weather the storm because the Hawke Government had already balanced its Budget and brought down inflation.\n\nThe Government postponed major policy adjustments, planning a mini-Budget for May. Hawke wrote to US President Reagan calling on the US to reduce its Budget deficit. The Business Council called for wage reductions, decreased government expenditure, a lower dollar and deregulation of the labour market. Seven months into the crisis, Hawke told the State Premiers that the \"savings of Australia must be freed\" to go into business investment for export expansion, and funding to the states was cut. A phase out of tariff protections was continued and company tax was cut by 10% to 39%. In the May mini-Budget, payment to the states was cut by $870 million and tax cuts deferred. The Government declared cost cutting was completed.\n\nA surge in commodity prices began in 1986 and assisted the economy to a small 1987 surplus of $2.3 Billion. With commodity prices now over their peak, economic conditions were entering a decline, with high interest rates, a growing current account deficit, declining demand, increasing foreign debt and a wave of corporate collapses. Furthermore, the collapse of the Eastern Bloc economies, was to see wool and wheat prices decline, savaging Australia's agricultural sector.\n\nTreasurer Paul Keating budgeted a record $9.1 billion surplus for 1989–90, and Labor won the 1990 election, aided by the support of environmentalists. To court the green vote, environment minister Graham Richardson had placed restrictions on mining (notably uranium mining) and logging which had a detrimental effect on already rising unemployment. David Barnett wrote in 1997 that Labor fiscal policy at this time \"self-defeating as \"with one hand it was imposing a monetary squeeze, while on the other it was encouraging spending with wage increases and tax cuts\".\n\nBy July 1990, Australia had entered severe recession. Initially, the Treasurer had insisted Australia would face a \"soft landing\", but after receiving the September quarter accounts indicating a large contraction of 1.6 per cent, he adopted a different political strategy, instead arguing that the downturn was a necessary correction by opening a press conference in November as follows:\n\nThe remark has continued to spark debate as to the extent of Keating's responsibility for the depth of the Recession. Former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane has said that policymakers did not \"set out to have a recession in order to reduce inflation. The recession happened because of the unwinding of the excesses of the 1980s, the international recession of the early 1990s and the high interest rates\". High interest rates were employed to slow the asset price boom of 1988–89. Treasurer Keating, the Reserve Bank and Treasury itself generally agreed on the need for high interest rates in 1989 and the pace of their reduction.\n\nThe popularity of Hawke's prime ministership, along with the health of the Hawke-Keating political partnership deteriorated along with the Australian economy and Keating began to position himself for a challenge. The Government promised economic recovery for 1991 and launched a series of asset sales to increase revenue. GDP sank, unemployment rose, revenue collapsed and welfare payments surged.\n\nAccording to former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane:\nReforms were conducted between 1990 and 1991, with Australia's telecommunications opened to competition; and tariffs were reduced to five per cent, while the phasing out of textile, clothing and motor vehicle protection began.\n\nA slow recovery from recession began around the September quarter in 1991, though unemployment continued to rise until late 1992.\n\nA number of financial institutions failed around Australia, including the State Bank of Victoria, the State Bank of South Australia, the Teachers Credit Union of Western Australia, the Pyramid Building Society as well as several merchant banks, a mortgage trust, and a friendly society.\n\nIn 1990, Victoria's Pyramid Building Society collapsed with debts in excess of $2 billion. With Victoria deeply in debt, Labor Premier John Cain resigned and Joan Kirner was elevated to the post of Premier of Victoria. Melbourne businessman Christopher Skase's business empire crashed spectacularly and he fled to Majorca in Spain. The Liberal-National Coalition, led by Jeff Kennett was swept into office in a 1992 landslide victory and commenced a wide ranging program of expenditure cuts, privatisation of public assets, and economic reform to reduced government debt and rejuvenate the economy.\n\nThe State Bank of South Australia, owned by the Government of South Australia, collapsed in 1991. The bank had been a beneficiary of the commercial property boom of the 1980s, but by February 1991 the Bannon Labor Government had to launch a $970 million bailout due to its bad debts, and the bank's debts soon reached $3 billion. Premier Bannon resigned after appearing at a Royal Commission into the affair.\n\nWith Western Australia suffering at the end of the 1980s boom, the Labor Party replaced Premier Brian Burke firstly with Peter Dowding and then Carmen Lawrence; the subsequent WA Inc investigation saw Burke jailed. West Australian high flying businessman Alan Bond was declared bankrupt in 1992 and jailed in 1997 for corporate fraud.\n\nThe Opposition Liberal Party of Australia turned to economist John Hewson as its new leader. Hewson argued that the nation was in economic crisis. He said the Hawke-Keating government had increased the severity of the recession by initially encouraging the economy to boom post-stock crash as elections were approaching, which necessitated higher interest rates and tighter monetary policy than would otherwise have been necessary. Hewson called for a radical reform program and formulated a package which included a consumption tax policy and industrial relations reform to address the poor economic situation. The Fightback! policy was launched in November 1991. The comprehensive plan further destabilised Hawke's leadership.\n\nThe ACTU campaigned for a wage increase. Hawke brokered an increase for waterside workers and public servants. By April 1991, unemployment was nearing 10% and rising. On 3 June, Keating challenged Hawke for the leadership of Labor, but lost the vote and became a destabilising presence on the back bench. The new treasurer, John Kerin and Deputy Prime Minister Brian Howe blamed Keating's 1990 economic policy for the poor state of the Australian economy. Industrial Relations Minister Peter Cook indicated an intention to introduce a more flexible wage system. In his July budget, Kerrin forecast a deficit of $4.7 billion. In a press conference, Kerin was unable to recall what GOS—Gross Operating Surplus—stood for. In December, shortly before Keating's successful second challenge against Hawke, Kerin was removed as Treasurer and appointed Minister for Transport and Communications and the Minister for Finance, Ralph Willis, became Treasurer. Hawke attributed the change to loss of confidence in communication.\n\nBy 1992, shortly after Hawke lost office and was replaced as leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister by his former deputy Paul Keating, unemployment had reached 11 per cent, the highest level in Australia since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Australia had faced eight-quarters of declining economic growth. The new prime minister, Paul Keating, placed emphasis on expanding ties to Asia as a means of securing Australia's economic future and tied this to a culture agenda of reducing ties to traditional allies.\n\nIn February 1992, the Keating Government released the \"One Nation\" policy, designed to target job creation. The government introduced the \"Australian National Training Authority Act 1992\" and the \"Disability Discrimination Act 1992\", which it hoped would assist the disabled to remain productive and off welfare. By the close of 1992, unemployment was still rising, but growth had improved.\n\nKeating called an election for March 1993. He promised company tax rate and personal income tax cuts (the \"L-A-W tax cuts\") and campaigned heavily against the Hewson led Opposition's proposal for a Goods and Services Tax. Despite the economic conditions, Keating led Labor to victory. With an ever rising deficit however, Keating was unable to deliver the tax cuts promised prior to the election and sought to reduce expenditure.\n\nIn May 1994, the government launched a five-year economic plan entitled \"Working Nation\". By the end of the year, inflation had declined, growth continued to improve and unemployment was again below 10%.\n\nFollowing the early 1990s recession, Australia experienced a record period of economic growth.\n\nSpeaking in 2006, former Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane said that a beneficial legacy of the 1990s recession was a lasting reduction in inflation.\n\nThe Liberal-National Coalition Government of John Howard was elected in a landslide victory in 1996. It reduced government expenditure, prioritised a return to Budget surplus and instigated industrial relations reforms to speed Australia's economic recovery. Following the 1998 Election, introduced a revised Goods and Services Tax. Inflation and interest rates lowered. Between 1996 and 2005, unemployment fell from over 8% to 5%. To strengthen the financial reporting framework for the financial sector, the Howard Government introduced the Corporations Act 2001 and Corporate Law Economic Reform Program Act 2004, following the recommendations in the Report of the HIH Insurance Royal Commission released in April 2003.\n"}

The objective of the Euclid mission is to better understand dark energy and dark matter by accurately measuring the acceleration of the universe. To achieve this, the Korsch-type telescope will measure the shapes of galaxies at varying distances from Earth and investigate the relationship between distance and redshift. Dark energy is generally accepted as contributing to the increased acceleration of the expanding universe, so understanding this relationship will help to refine how physicists and astrophysicists understand it. Euclid's mission advances and complements ESA's Planck telescope. The mission is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid of Alexandria. \n\nEuclid is a medium-class (\"M-class\") mission and is part of ESA's \"Cosmic Vision\" (2015–2025) scientific program. This class of missions have an ESA budget cap at around €500 million. Euclid was chosen in October 2011 together with Solar Orbiter, out of several competing missions. The launch date is planned for 2020.\n\nEuclid will probe the history of the expansion of the universe and the formation of cosmic structures by measuring the redshift of galaxies out to a factor of 2, which is equivalent to seeing back 10 billion years in the past. The link between galactic shapes and their corresponding redshift will give a look into how dark energy contributes to the increased acceleration of the universe. The methods employed exploit the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, measurement of Baryon acoustic oscillations, and measurement of galactic distances by spectroscopy.\n\nGravitational lensing (or gravitational shear) is a consequence of the deflection of light rays caused by the presence of matter that locally modifies the curvature of space-time: light emitted by galaxies, and therefore observed images, are distorted as they pass close to matter lying along the line of sight. This matter is composed partly of visible galaxies but it is mostly dark matter. By measuring this \"shear\", the amount of dark matter can be inferred, furthering the understanding of how it is distributed in the universe.\n\nSpectroscopic measurements will permit measuring the redshifts of galaxies and determining their distances using the Hubble's Law. In this way one can reconstruct the three-dimensional distribution of galaxies in the universe.\n\nFrom this data, it is possible to simultaneously measure the statistical properties concerning the distribution of dark matter and galaxies, and measure how these properties change as the spacecraft looks further back in time. Highly precise images are required to provide the most accurate measurements, as any distortion inherent in the sensors themselves must be accounted for and calibrated out, otherwise the resultant data will be of questionable use.\n\nESA selected Thales Alenia Space Italy for the construction of the satellite. Euclid is 4.5 metres long with a diameter of 3.1 metres and a mass of 2.1 tonnes.\n\nThe Euclid payload is managed by Airbus Defence and Space. It consists of a Korsch telescope with a primary mirror 1.2 meters in diameter, which covers an area of 0.5 deg. An international consortium of scientists will provide a visible instrument (VIS) and an infrared instrument (NISP). These large format cameras will be used to characterise the morphometric, photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies:\n\n\nThe telescope bus includes solar panels that provide power and stabilises the orientation and pointing of the telescope to better than 35 milliarcseconds. The telescope is carefully insulated to ensure good thermal stability so as to not disturb the optical alignment.\n\nThe telecommunications system is capable of transferring 850 gigabits per day. It uses the Ka band to send scientific data at a rate of 55 megabits per second during the allocated period of 4 hours per day to the 35-m dish Cebreros ground station in Spain, when the telescope is visible from Earth. Euclid will have an onboard storage capacity of at least 300 GB.\n\nIn 2015 Euclid passed a preliminary design review, having completed a large number of technical designs as well as built and tested key components.\n\nEuclid will be launched on a Soyuz rocket from Kourou. Following a travel time of 30 days it will be stabilised to travel a Lissajous path of large amplitude (about 1 million kilometres) around the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point L2.\n\nDuring its mission, which will last at least 6 years, Euclid will observe about 15,000 deg, or about a third of the extragalactic sky (the sky facing away from the Milky Way). The survey will be complemented by additional observations about 10 times deeper pointing toward two different fields located close to the ecliptic poles and covering 20 deg each. The two fields will be regularly visited during the whole duration of the mission. They will be used as calibration fields and to monitor the telescope and instrument performance stability as well as to produce scientific data to observed the most distant galaxies and quasars in the universe.\n\nTo measure a photometric redshift for each galaxy with sufficient accuracy, the Euclid mission depends on additional photometric data obtained in at least 4 visible filters. This data will be obtained from ground-based telescopes located in both northern and southern hemispheres to cover the full 15,000 deg of the mission. In total each galaxy of the Euclid mission will get photometric information in at least 7 different filters covering the whole range 460–2000 nm.\n\nAbout 10 billion astronomical sources will be observed by Euclid, of which 1 billion will have their gravitational shear measured with a precision 50 times more accurate than is possible today using ground-based telescopes. Euclid will measure spectroscopic redshifts for 50 million objects.\n\nThe scientific exploitation of this enormous data set will be carried out by a European-led consortium of more than 1200 people in over 100 laboratories in 15 countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Switzerland, UK, Canada and the US). The Euclid Consortium is also responsible for the construction of the Euclid instrument payload and for the development and implementation of the Euclid ground segment which will process all data collected by the satellite. The laboratories contributing to the Euclid Consortium are funded and supported by their national space agencies, which also have the programmatic responsibilities of their national contribution, and by their national research structures (research agencies, observatories, universities). Overall, the Euclid Consortium contributes to about 30% of the total budget cost of the mission until completion.\n\nThe huge volume, diversity (space and ground, visible and near infrared, morphometry, photometry and spectroscopy) and the high level of precision of measurements needed demand considerable care and effort in the data processing making this a critical part of the mission. ESA, the national agencies and the Euclid Consortium are spending considerable resources to set up top level teams of researchers and engineers in algorithm development, software development, testing and validation procedures, data archiving and data distribution infrastructures. In total, 9 Science Data Centres spread over countries of the Euclid Consortium will process more than 10 petabytes of raw input images over 10 years to deliver by 2028 a public data base of the Euclid mission to the whole scientific community.\n\nWith its wide sky coverage and its catalogues of billions of stars and galaxies, the scientific value of data collected by the mission goes beyond the scope of cosmology. This database will provide the worldwide astronomical community with abundant sources and targets for the future missions such as JWST, E-ELT, TMT, ALMA, SKA or LSST.\n\n"}

{"id": "1537122", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1537122", "title": "Hold-up problem", "text": "Hold-up problem\n\nIn economics, the hold-up problem (or commitment problem) is central to the theory of incomplete contracts and shows the difficulty in writing complete contracts. A hold-up problem arises when two factors are present:\nThe hold-up problem is a situation where two parties may be able to work most efficiently by cooperating but refrain from doing so because of concerns that they may give the other party increased bargaining power, and thereby reduce their own profits. When party A has made a prior commitment to a relationship with party B, the latter can 'hold up' the former for the value of that commitment. The hold-up problem leads to severe economic cost and might also lead to underinvestment.\n\nIt is often argued that the possibility of a hold-up can lead to underinvestment in relation-specific investment and thus inefficiency. Underinvestment occurs because investors cannot guarantee themselves a sufficient share of the return through ex post bargaining. Consequently, predictions of the outcome are very sensitive to assumptions made about the bargaining process. The bargaining process can be seen as a game with multiple equilibria. Underinvestment may occur only when the agent fails to coordinate on an efficient equilibrium.\n\nIn a scenario where two risk-neutral parties S (supplier) and B (Buyer) can make profit by working together, it is efficient to work together as long as the buyers' valuation exceeds the sellers' costs (Schmitz, 2001). When the two parties could agree on a binding contract covering the whole period of the investment and anticipating all possible outcomes and providing protection for both parties in every situation that may arise at the time the investment is made, the parties would have enough confidence to make the investment, and both parties could enjoy high profits. Then, it can be assumed that there are no wealth constraints and there is no private information. According to the Coase theorem, voluntary bargaining results in trade whenever it is efficient. However, making such a contract is not often possible for these four reasons:\n\nThe initial contract can cover only short-term situations; eventually, renegotiation is needed, which provides an opportunity for e.g. S to hold up B. As S knows that the investment is a significant cost to B and tries to use this as leverage to negotiate an increase in its prices. In that case, S has more bargaining power, compared to B, and tries to use it to its own advantage. The source of power lies in the investment of B. For B it is hard to find out whether or not the raise in prices is reasonable. In an extreme case, S could demand 100 percent of the profits if the only alternative to B is to lose the entire initial investment. Even if the outcome would be Pareto efficient, B might not accept the agreement. If the renegotiations turn out to be unsuccessful both parties are worse off: B has made an investment that goes to waste, and S lost a customer.\n\nInefficiency is caused by the hold-up problem when B is reluctant to make the investment ex ante from the fear that S uses its extra bargaining power to its own advantage. In that case the supplier is 'holding up' the buyer.\n\nA historic example concerns the US car industry, but the example is sharply disputed by Coase (2000). Fisher Body had an exclusive contract with General Motors (GM) to supply car body parts and so Fisher Body was the only company to deliver the components according to GM's specifications. In 1920, a sharp increase in demand occurred that was above expectations. It is claimed that Fisher Body used the unforeseen situation to hold up GM by increasing the price for the additional parts produced. It has been said that the hold up led to GM acquiring Fisher Body in 1926.\n\nDuring transition out of South African apartheid, many white elites feared that democratization would result in tyranny of the majority. Now that fair elections were held, many wealthy whites feared that the longtime poor blacks (or their elected representatives) would expropriate wealth from the white minority. For this reason there was white resistance against democratic and fair elections. To ensure a peaceful transition (and to uphold the credibility of the elections), the African National Congress needed to make a commitment to protect the incomes and wealth of the white elites. This commitment allowed whites to respect the results of a democratic election which would put the majority blacks in power. That credible commitment from the ANC made the new democractic regime sufficiently attractive to whites in South Africa, otherwise they would not have agreed to transition out of autocracy.\n\nRogerson (1992) showed the existence of a first-best contractual solution to the hold-up problem in even extremely complex environments involving x agents with arbitrarily complex transaction decisions and utility functions. He shows that three important environmental assumptions must be made:\nFurthermore, the solution also requires 'powerful' contracts to be written.\nAccording to Rogerson (1992) the hold-up problem does not necessarily create inefficiencies; when it does, one of the above requirements is not satisfied. The requirements are necessary to come to an absolutely best solution.\n\nIf there are direct externalities and renegotiation cannot be prevented, even under symmetric information, underinvestment cannot be avoided. If there are direct externalities, the seller's investment is a hidden action and the buyer has private information about its valuation, the absolutely best solution may not be attained even when the parties have full commitment power. In the absence of direct externalities, simple contracts may solve the hold-up problem even when each party has private information about its valuation. Maskin and Tirole (1999) argue that complex contracts can solve the hold-up problem when there are ex ante indescribable contingencies, and Hart and Moore (1999) argue that the solution does not work when renegotiation cannot be ruled out. Taken together, whether or not suitable contracts can solve the hold-up problem is disputed in contract theory. In an experimental study, Hoppe and Schmitz (2011) found that option contracts may alleviate the hold-up problem even when renegotiation is possible, which may be explained by Hart and Moore's (2008) idea that contracts may serve as reference points.\n\nResearch of Nöldeke and Schmidt (1995) argued that the underinvestment problem due to the hold-up problem is eliminated if parties are able to write a simple option contract. Such a contract gives the seller the right but not the obligation to deliver a fixed quantity of the good and also makes the contractual payment of the buyer dependent on the delivery decision of the seller. Thus, this contract does not depend on renegotiation or complicated mechanisms, but its crucial feature is that one of the parties can unilaterally decide whether the trade takes place. However, such a contract is unachievable unless it is possible to enforce the payments conditional on the delivery decision of the seller. That means that the court must be able to verify delivery of the good to the buyer by the seller. The possibility was ruled out in earlier research where it was assumed that when trade fails, it is not possible for the court to distinguish whether the buyer did not accept the delivery or the seller refused to supply.\n\nThe organization and governance structure of a firm might be seen as a mechanism for dealing with a hold-up problem. A solution to the hold-up problem is vertical integration such as a merger in which all parts of the body being produced internally rather than outside. Vertical integration shifts the ownership of the organizational asset of the firm and therewith creates more flexibility and avoids potential of a hold-up. In that way, the (transaction) costs associated with contractually induced hold-ups are saved and also the costs associated with the number of contracts written and executed. Hold-up problems are created from the existence of firm-specific investments.but also from the set of long-term contracts that are used in the presence of the certain investments. Whether a vertical integration is adopted as a solution to the hold-up problem depends on the magnitude of the specific investment and the ability to write long-term contracts, flexible enough to avoid a potential hold-up. However, the ability to write flexible long-term contracts strongly depends upon the underlying market uncertainty and the reputation of the company. Therefore, those factors will also influence the likelihood of vertical integration. The extent to which vertical integration can alleviate the hold-up problem also depends on the information structure. While traditional incomplete contracting models of vertical integration such as Grossman and Hart (1986) assume symmetric information, Schmitz (2006) has extended the incomplete contracting framework to allow for asymmetric information.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "40929468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40929468", "title": "Hunchun incident", "text": "Hunchun incident\n\nThe Hunchun incident (October 2, 1920) was a reported raid on a Japanese consulate in Manchuria resulting in the death of thirteen Japanese. The Japanese government used this incident to justify sending thousands of Imperial Japanese troops into Manchuria on October 5, 1920. These escalations culminated with the Battle of Qingshanli (October 21–26, 1920) between Japan and the Korean Independence Army, where Korean rebels fought Japanese soldiers.\n\nFor more than a decade prior to Korea’s March 1st Movement (1919) nationalist groups of Korean rebels, many of whom were former soldiers in the Korean army, organized into various pro-independence factions in Manchuria. Due to its strategic location across the Korean border, guerilla fighters could effectively launch raids on Japanese consular police stations, and then retreat back to the Chinese side of the boundary. For example, Hong Pomdo (a previous Righteous Army leader) created the Korean Independence Army and trained so-called independence fighters in Yanji. Additionally, the Northern Route Military Headquarters was established under the leadership of So Il, with Kim Chwajin commanding more than four hundred independence fighters at its officer training school. Separately, Yi Tonghwi also trained over 3,000 independence fighters in Hunchun and armed them with weapons provided by the Red Bolshevik army.\n\nResponding to the March 1st Movement’s failure to secure independence and arouse international sentiments toward the Koreans’ plight under Japanese colonial rule, disaffected Koreans came together on April 13, 1919 in Shanghai to form a republican Korean provisional government with the hope of working together with the independence factions in Manchuria to eventually obtain freedom from Japan.\n\nAs the momentum behind Korean independence movements in Manchuria increased, Japanese consular police chief Suematsu Kichiji became increasingly concerned about increasing radical Bolshevism among Koreans. To try and suppress these movements, he ordered numerous illegal police raids on suspected radical Jiandao base camps, which were protested by local Chinese leaders. While it is clear that some of the Korean guerrilla fighters in Manchuria were influenced by leftist ideologies, the major factions primarily supported the Shanghai Provisional Government and were focused primarily on Korean independence and self-determination.\n\nAngered by the Japanese suppression of the March 1st Movement, Korean independence fighters in Manchuria began increasing their raids against Japanese border posts, killing numerous Japanese guards, with the eventual goal of advancing into Korea to remove the Japanese. During the early summer months of 1920, Korean rebels fought with Japanese troops in thirty-two battles along the border. After one particular Japanese counterattack, Hong Pomdo’s forces surrounded and killed 120 Japanese soldiers and wounded more than 200.\n\nIn effort to contain the Korean rebels, Japan petitioned both Tokyo and the Chinese government to help, but received little assistance. Subsequently, on October 2, 1920, a Japanese consulate in the Chinese city of Hunchun in Jilin Province was attacked and burned to the ground purportedly (according to Japanese sources) by the Korean Independence Army, killing thirteen Japanese people. It was further reported that the “bandits” carrying out this attack “committed indiscriminate acts of murder and pillage” and “looted local shops.”\n\nMany South Korean historians maintain, however, that the attack on Hunchun was not carried out by the Korean rebels, but rather was staged by the Japanese to justify incursion into Manchuria. Some South Korean sources further believe that the attack was coordinated with Chinese bandit leader Ch'ang-chiang-hao who had been bribed by the Japanese to carry out the attack with several bandits in order to incriminate the Koreans. These sources maintain that Chang went further than the Japanese had requested him to in the scale of his attack. Other South Korean scholars even maintain that the entire incident was a complete Japanese fabrication.\n\nNorth Korea is likewise skeptical about the Japanese narrative of the incident, with official sources recently asserting that “the Japanese imperialists cooked up the ‘Hunchun incident’ in which they hurled mounted bandits into attacking their consulate and kicked up a wholesale whirlwind of suppression against Koreans in Northeast China under that pretext.”\n\nThough it is difficult for historians to determine who was behind the attack, or whether the incident actually took place, this controversial event is historically significant because Japan used it to justify its escalated military intervention in Manchuria. Japan petitioned and received permission from China to send 15,000 troops from the 19th Division of the Chosen Army of Japan to contain the Korean rebel armies in Jilin province.\n\nIn reaction to the Hunchun incident, a Japanese punitive “Jiandao Expedition” was accordingly sent to Manchuria, and used “search and destroy” patrols to suppress the guerrilla fighters by carrying out numerous arrests and executions. By December 1920, a Korean Commission report described that Japanese soldiers had burned down thirty-two villages and killed “all the male inhabitants of the [Hunchun] district, and massacred 145 peaceful inhabitants.” One house was reportedly burned down with “women and children inside.”\n\nThough Korean independence forces in Manchuria were never effectively organized under the leadership of the Shanghai Provisional Government, they did achieve notable military victories against the Japanese brigades. The most significant of these was the Battle of Qingshanli, where about 400 Korean rebels were able to defeat the better-trained Japanese after four days of intense combat. In this battle the Koreans killed about 1,200 Japanese soldiers while losing only 60 of their own. However, according to Japanese records, 11 soldiers were killed in action, 24 wounded.\n\nIn early 1921, after a series of skirmishes and retreats on both sides, as well as criticism from local Chinese authorities and the international community, most members of the 19th Division withdrew from eastern Manchuria. Some of the socialist-leaning Korean rebels were then recruited by the Red Bolshevik army to assist in its civil war prior to the formation of the Soviet Union.\n"}
{"id": "22304729", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22304729", "title": "International asset recovery", "text": "International asset recovery\n\nInternational asset recovery is any effort by governments to repatriate the proceeds of corruption hidden in foreign jurisdictions. Such assets may include monies in bank accounts, real estate, vehicles, arts and artifacts, and precious metals. As defined under the United Nations Convention against Corruption, asset recovery refers to recovering the proceeds of corruption, rather than broader terms such as asset confiscation or asset forfeiture which refer to recovering the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime in general.\n\nOften used to emphasize the \"multi-jurisdictional\" or cross-border aspects of a corruption investigation, international asset recovery includes numerous processes such as the tracing, freezing, confiscation, and repatriation of proceeds stored in foreign jurisdictions, thus \"making it one of the most complex projects in the field of law\". Even considering the difficulties present, Africa specialist Daniel Scher counters that international asset recovery's \"potential rewards in developing countries make it a highly attractive undertaking\".\n\nDespite domestic legislation in some countries allowing for the confiscation and forfeiture of proceeds of corruption, it is improvements in finance, transportation, and communications technologies in the 20th century that have made it easier for corrupt leaders and other \"politically exposed persons\" to conceal massive amounts of stolen wealth in offshore financial centers.\n\nBy taking advantage of differences in legal systems, the high costs in coordinating investigations, lack of international cooperation, and bank secrecy in some recipient countries, corrupt officials have been able to preserve much of their loot overseas.\n\nRecovering stolen assets is important for a variety of reasons. According to the World Bank, the cross-border flow of proceeds from criminal activity, corruption and tax evasion is estimated between US$1–1.6 trillion per year—half of this amount is looted from developing and transition economies. US $20–40 billion of this flow originated in bribes to public officials from developing and transition countries. A 2005 report by the Commission for Africa cites a European Commission estimate that \"stolen African assets equivalent to more than half of the continent's external debt are held in foreign banks accounts\". As stated by the World Bank in 2004, \"corruption is... the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. Corruption undermines development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends. The harmful effects of corruption are especially severe on the world's poorest, who are most reliant on the provision of public services, and are least capable of paying the extra costs associated with fraud and corruption\".\n\nSeveral countries, especially economically deprived nations, have endured the brunt of systemic corruption as their public wealth illegally flowed into bank accounts and properties in developed countries and offshore financial centres. Successful conviction of criminals and/or confiscation of their assets creates a strong deterrent for potential corrupt officials that there is no safe haven for hiding illicit wealth.\n\nSuccesses in recent years in recovering billions of dollars of stolen assets has demonstrated that asset recovery is feasible. For example, by 2005 Nigeria had recovered $1.2 billion stolen by former President Sani Abacha by requesting assistance from multiple jurisdictions including Switzerland, Jersey, and Liechtenstein. To recover Nigerian assets, the Swiss government designated the Abacha family a \"criminal organization\", allowing it to bypass the need for a conviction.\n\nAdditionally, asset recovery was recognized as \"a fundamental principle\" of the UNCAC. The signing and ratification of the UNCAC by over 160 countries is seen as a major step in furthering cooperation between countries to join forces to fight corruption and assist each other in recovering looted assets. Legal precedents, increasing international cooperation, as well as enhanced capacities make asset recovery more possible now than ever.\n\nManaging the stages of an asset recovery investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires a great deal of resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually come in the form of a Mutual Legal Assistance request or a letter rogatory, though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the requested country in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.\n\nEach of the necessary steps—tracing, freezing, confiscation and repatriation—presents its own unique challenges.\n\nDetermining the existence of assets through an exhaustive financial investigation is the first requirement in any asset recovery case. Assets must be followed not only to their final hiding place, but causality must be established between the asset and the criminal activity. This poses a particular challenge when dealing with developing countries that have a cash-based society where monies often do not flow through the recorded financial system, other techniques must be used.\n\nWhen assets do go through the financial system, tracing from one account to the next will usually leave an audit trail that can be exploited by financial investigators. As stolen assets are often layered through several different accounts and corporate vehicles, investigators will often benefit from outside information such as seized financial documents and suspicious transaction reports filed with banking regulators and other law enforcement agencies. Given the speed that monies can be transferred in the global financial system, identifying and tracing the bank accounts of the perpetrators is not an easy task, even for a seasoned investigator. A high degree of expertise, resources and cooperation between multiple intelligence and law enforcement agencies is essential for successful tracing.\n\nThough not often, occasionally investigators may come across documentation that leads directly to the stolen assets. For example, investigations seeking to trace Ferdinand Marcos' looted billions were greatly accelerated by finding Marcos' bank records in the former presidential palace. Additionally, suspicious activity reports filed with national financial intelligence units can often uncover connections that can expose cases of grand corruption.\n\nTo obtain non-public information in foreign jurisdictions requires the submission of either a \"Mutual Legal Assistance\" (MLA) request, obtain a disclosure action through a tort claim, or submit a traditional letter rogatory through diplomatic channels. These requests are more likely to be successful when all countries involved have treaties in place, either bilateral or multilateral, to allow for legal cooperation. Notably, the UNCAC purports to provide a legal basis for international cooperation for asset recovery.\n\nOnce financial investigations have identified assets as being possible proceeds of crime/corruption, freezing those assets becomes critical. However, premature freezing prevents investigators from following the money trail in real time. If alerted, the beneficiaries of targeted assets will most likely try to transfer the assets to make them unreachable. If delayed, there is a risk that the assets may be transferred beyond the investigator's reach. Confidentiality is key at this point. To prevent suspects from moving assets yet to be discovered, courts can place a gag order to prevent banks or officials from informing their clients until a transfer request is made. Recently some banks have also begun proactively cooperating with their national financial intelligence units by requesting consent on suspicious transfers.\n\nIn March 2006, a Guernsey branch of Banque Nationale de Paris Paribas refused to transfer funds beneficially controlled by Tommy Suharto and instead froze the funds based on guidance from Guernsey's Financial Services Commission.\n\nWhether by criminal or civil actions, a judgment is essential to transfer legal ownership of assets already frozen back to the requesting country. See Legal Avenues to Obtaining Judgment below.\n\nThere is no standard procedure for the restitution of illicitly acquired assets, as no two cases are exactly alike. Certain cases involving asset recovery have seen difficulties emerge during the repatriation stage.\nWhile stolen money is unquestionably the sovereign property of the requesting government, enforcing asset recovery requests is often complex and costly. Often there are complex issues around the claims of legitimate third parties, as corrupt proceeds can be mixed with legitimate income.\n\nAdditionally, requested countries and the international community as a whole do not want to see repatriated assets embezzled all over again. Although determining the disposal of assets is handled on a case-by-case basis, the World Bank has acted as a neutral third party to ensure that assets are invested into development efforts such as health and education.\n\nDetermining the tactic by which an asset recovery practitioner can obtain court judgments to freeze, seize, and repatriate assets is also of critical importance. Generally, there are four approaches which can be taken to recover stolen assets.\n\nCourts have the authority to confiscate assets that have been identified as the proceeds or instrumentalities of crime. In the context of international asset recovery, using criminal convictions to recover stolen assets is usually only possible when a legal basis exists between states, such as a bi-lateral or multilateral agreement. If no other arrangement is in place, UNCAC signatories may use the Convention itself as a legal basis for enforcing confiscation orders obtained in a foreign criminal court. Specifically, Article 54 Section 1A of the UNCAC provides that:\n\n\"Each State Party (will)... take such measures as may be necessary to permit its competent authorities to give effect to an order of confiscation issued by a court of another state party.\"\n\nIndeed, UNCAC Section 54 2A also provides for the provisional freezing or seizing of property where there are sufficient grounds for taking such actions in advance of a formal request being received. Generally, dual criminality must also exist between the jurisdictions, whereby the predicate offense must be recognized as a crime by both the requested and requesting state.\n\nMutual Legal Assistance (MLA) is vital to this process, although there remain countries that are reluctant to enforce a court order from another jurisdiction without some form of pre-existing treaty. However, MLA requests can generate vital information in the early stages of an investigation in tracing, identifying, and temporarily freezing the accounts linked to corruption.\n\nTo be truly effective, international asset recoveries through MLA require strong inter-state cooperation as well as two critical elements—a criminal conviction either in the requesting state or the recipient state, and an enforceable confiscation order.\n\nHowever, satisfying conditions for international asset recovery using criminal convictions remains problematic. Criminal proceedings usually require that the accused is present before the court, where many wrongdoers may be dead or have fled the country to avoid arrest or prosecution. MLA requests must be detailed and precisely written in the language of the requested state. Additionally, influential and powerful defendants can use their influence to suppress investigations, manipulate witnesses or judges, or hire law firms to create endless adjournments and appeals.\n\nStates have another option to recover stolen assets—civil proceedings. In relation to foreign assets, a State will bring a private action in the civil courts of the foreign jurisdiction where corruptly acquired assets are located. This is the same process that would be used by private citizens or corporate entities with a claim against another, in the context of fraud for example, by a liquidator seeking to recover assets wrongfully diverted from an insolvent company.\n\nThis mechanism has been particularly successful in international cases involving public officials where a criminal conviction of corruption is difficult or impossible to obtain. Among the benefits of civil proceedings include a lower burden of proof (\"clear and convincing/balance of probabilities\" instead of \"beyond a reasonable doubt\") and the absence of a defendant not preventing progress in the proceedings. Instead, the court is satisfied so long as the defendant has been properly served notice of the proceedings. In the United Kingdom, the High Court held that serving notice to a lawyer acting on behalf of a defendant has also been used when the individual is in hiding.\n\nAdditionally, civil courts retain some of the benefits of a criminal action, for example the ability to freeze assets to prevent dispersal, pierce bank secrecy, issue gag orders to third parties to maintain the confidentiality of the investigation, and even order search/seizure actions. Many practitioners have found that effective programs to recover corruptly acquired assets often use a coordinated package of criminal and civil measures to secure and recover assets. Furthermore, where criminal mechanisms can go some way to freeze but not recover assets, civil proceedings may effectively intervene.\n\nA third tactic is the use of in rem actions, also known as Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture (NCBF) to recover assets directly. This method takes place in a civil court. An advantage of in rem actions is that it does not require either a civil or criminal conviction against an individual in order to confiscate his/her assets. Instead, guilt is assigned to the property and prosecutors must only prove that the property in question was involved in an illegal activity. Hence, a possible case name for in rem action could be 'United States of America vs. US $100,000 in a Toyota Pickup.' The owner or beneficiary of targeted property must then prove that either that the property was not involved or that he/she provide an innocent owner defense.\n\nIn rem asset recovery has been controversial and the fairness of the procedures has been questioned. Prior to 2000 in the United States, for example, the burden of proof was on the property owner to prove that his property was not derived from, or used to commit, a criminal offense, and there was no remedy for \"innocent owners\" who were without fault concerning the illegal use of their property. Remedial legislation enacted in 2000, however, addressed these concerns and Non-Conviction Based Asset Forfeiture has become a standard part of law enforcement in the U.S., yielding US$1.5b annually in asset recoveries. While encouraged in UNCAC, adapting domestic law to create a legal basis for in rem recoveries is not required of state parties. Examples of in rem legislation can be found in jurisdictions such as the United States, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, Australia, Colombia and Ireland.\n\nIn civil law jurisdictions, there is a fourth mechanism which is a hybrid between conviction-based and in rem actions. An 'accion civil resarcitoria' is meant to redress victims of criminal offenses and to expedite the process it takes place within the criminal court. Such actions depend on the criminal proceedings in that it cannot be initiated unless there is a concurrent criminal investigation underway. Once the criminal proceedings make it to trial, the accion civil resarcitoria separates in that forfeiture of property is not dependent on a criminal conviction of an individual. Unlike a criminal confiscation or in rem action, a successful 'accion civil resarcitoria' recognizes damages and awards a monetary compensation.\n\nFor example, in Switzerland, where foreign States seeking the return of corruptly acquired assets are often permitted to be a civil party to Swiss criminal investigations or proceedings concerning those assets. Such investigations or proceedings may be commenced by an investigating magistrate on receipt of a request for mutual legal assistance. The foreign State will have the ability to access documents on the Court file, to participate in the examination of witnesses, to make submissions to the investigating magistrate, and to seek the repatriation of the assets. This procedure produces an efficient and often effective combination of civil and criminal proceedings.\n\nUnited Nations Convention against Corruption (2005)\n\nResponding to increasing recognition of the problems caused by public corruption and its devastating effects on the poorest of nations, the international community took a bold step in 2003 by creating and ratifying the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC).\n\nThe UNCAC came into force on December 14, 2005 and so far has been ratified by over 130 parties. While the UNCAC is not the first international effort to combat corruption, it is innovative in two respects: it is the first treaty to reference the recovery of stolen assets as a priority in the fight against corruption. Second, the treaty also provides a nearly universal multi-lateral platform for mutual legal assistance in corruption related offenses.\n\nOECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions (1999)\n- A convention signed by 37 countries, this OECD convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials in the context of international business transactions be criminalized. The framework of the Convention is housed in the OECD Secretariat, but country-level compliance is ensured through a rigorous peer-evaluation mechanism which monitors both the legislative framework and implementation in signatory countries under the auspices of the OECD Working Group on Bribery.\n\nMore specifically, the OECD Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable, by effective, proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable to those applicable to their own public officials. It commits Parties to interpret territorial jurisdiction in as broad a manner as possible and to establish nationality jurisdiction if this is in accord with their legal system. Parties are obliged to establish corporate liability (the liability of \"legal persons\") for foreign bribery, and where a Party's legal system does not provide criminal liability for companies, the Party must apply effective, proportionate and dissuasive non-criminal sanctions to them. Furthermore, countries must facilitate mutual legal assistance and cannot invoke \"bank secrecy\" to deny mutual legal assistance. While the OECD Convention is important in the sense that it creates the obligation for state parties to criminalize the bribery of foreign public officials, it does not directly consider the recovery of proceeds of corruption.\n\nUnited Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (2003)\nThe United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized came into force on September 29, 2003 and has been ratified by over 145 countries. The purpose of this Convention is to promote cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crime more effectively. It is the main international instrument in the fight against transnational organized crime. Especially relevant to asset recovery is Article 6 of the Convention, which requires state parties to criminalize the laundering the proceeds of crime, and Article 12, which requires parties to create a legal basis for the confiscation of proceeds of crime.\n\nInter-American Convention Against Corruption (1997)\n\nThe Inter-American Convention Against Corruption (IACAC) was adopted by the member countries of the Organization of American States on 29 March 1996; it came into force on 6 March 1997. The IACAC is distinctive in that it was the first international convention to address the problem of corruption.\n\nCurrently, the IACAC is ratified by 33 countries.\n\nAfrican Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption and Related Offences (2003)\n\nIn the spirit of complementing UNCAC, 35 African Heads of State and Government met in Maputo, Mozambique in July 2003. According to Honorable. Dauda Kamara, Member of the Pan-African Parliament, a specific regional convention was \"considered necessary because Africa, given its currently low-level economic development, needed to adopt specific and well defined measures that will protect its vast resources from any further exploitation by more powerful and developed nations of the world through corrupt practices\". The Convention was entered into force on August 5, 2006 after the required minimum of 15 signatories was met. To date, 43 countries have signed the Convention and 29 states have ratified it.\n\nThere are several organizations that have prioritized asset recovery and created initiatives to enable further international cooperation while bringing the issue to the forefront of political and public discussion. These initiatives also include providing technical assistance, research and capacity development to developing countries.\n\nThese organizations include but are not limited to:\n\n\nAdditionally, several regional networks exist to facilitate judicial cooperation between national authorities by enabling direct personal contact and sharing information. These networks include, but are not limited to:\n\nAsset recovery can be a highly complex field of work, requiring expertise, funds, coordinated action and persistence. [COSP Note on AR] Training and technical assistance are sometimes needed to pursue asset recovery cases, particularly in those countries lacking institutional framework and experience.\n\nSeveral international and inter-governmental organizations with assistance from development agencies and donor countries have begun addressing this challenge. International organizations such as the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the World Bank's StAR Initiative and the Swiss-based non-governmental organization International Centre for Asset Recovery have been offering training and capacity development.\n\nSeveral organizations have taken steps to address the lack of easily accessible, comprehensive and practical information on international asset recovery. This lack of information has been identified as a key problem by a number of countries at the first meeting of the UNCAC Open-Ended Working Group on Asset Recovery held in Vienna in August 2007. The ICAR hosts an online Asset Recovery Knowledge Center that includes technical publications, news articles, case studies, and individual country laws. Other organizations such as the StAR Initiative have created in-depth handbooks and manuals to assist practitioners. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) offers a free MLA Request Writer Tool. The U4 Help Desk gives practitioners the ability to ask experts any question related to asset recovery/anti-corruption and receive a tailor made response within 10 working days (or assistance within 48 hours in case of urgency).\n\n\nDespite increases in national capacities and enhanced international cooperation, many technical, legal, political, and material challenges still remain. Furthermore, there are several thorny issues to be resolved concerning the repatriation and monitoring of stolen assets to victim countries.\n\nLack of political will has been identified repeatedly as one of the stumbling blocks to effective international asset recovery.\n\nWhile over 130 countries have ratified UNCAC, there still needs to be greater international cooperation and awareness. Twenty countries have signed but not ratified the UNCAC. In other cases, mutual legal assistance requests have not been honored in spite of treaty obligations. There are many examples of cases where international asset recovery would have been possible, if there had been political will. These include: monies in Switzerland frozen that belonged to the former Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko and against former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi.\n\nThe exact terms of repatriation are still unclear. Without specific mutual legal assistance agreements, they are done on a case by case basis. For instance, Switzerland confiscated US 600 million of former Nigerian President Abacha's loot, but worked out an agreement to use the money for development purposes, monitored by the World Bank. Other potential agreements are not so generous. When Indonesia originally approached Hong Kong to repatriate Indonesian banker Hendra Rahardja's assets, the Hong Kong authorities offered to assist for a 20% commission, and then splitting the remaining money evenly.\n\n\nRemedial procedures are necessary in situations where a defendant has died, absconded, or the statute of limitations has expired. Should any of these conditions apply, a traditional criminal process is not possible and assets cannot be recovered. Therefore, the UNCAC promotes the creation of remedial procedures to deal with such cases, such as Non-Conviction Based Forfeiture.\n\nFor more detailed information, the International Centre for Asset Recovery's Knowledge Center also contains a large collection of legal instruments, glossary, case studies, and publications relating to asset recovery. Notably, the Knowledge Center has an extensively detailed library of asset recovery related news articles, along with a Newsfeed that is updated daily.\n\nThe Stolen Assets Recovery Initiative has also put together a Stolen Asset Recovery bibliography which contains a list of books, journal articles and reports and other working papers produced by both governmental and nongovernmental organizations which touch upon issues associated with the recovery of stolen assets in cases of political corruption. The materials listed in the bibliography focus on many aspects of the asset recovery process – from investigation and prosecution in corruption cases, to identification of stolen assets and also mutual legal assistance in situations where assets are located in a foreign jurisdiction from which a victim country seeks their return. The StAR bibliography also draws upon literature on related topics including money laundering prevention and civil asset forfeiture.\n"}
{"id": "1964717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1964717", "title": "Jam session", "text": "Jam session\n\nA jam session is a relatively informal musical event, process, or activity where musicians, typically instrumentalists, play improvised solos and vamp on tunes, songs and chord progressions. To \"jam\" is to improvise music without extensive preparation or predefined arrangements, except for when the group is playing well-known jazz standards or covers of existing popular songs. Original jam sessions, also 'free flow sessions', are often used by musicians to develop new material (music) and find suitable arrangements. Both styles can be used simply as a social gathering and communal practice session. Jam sessions may be based upon existing songs or forms, may be loosely based on an agreed chord progression or chart suggested by one participant, or may be wholly improvisational. Jam sessions can range from very loose gatherings of amateurs to evenings where a jam session coordinator or host acts as a \"gatekeeper\" to ensure that only appropriate-level performers take the stage, to sophisticated improvised recording sessions by professionals which are intended to be broadcast live on radio or TV or edited and released to the public.\n\nOne source for the phrase \"jam session\" came about in the 1920s when white and black musicians would congregate after their regular paying gigs, to play the jazz they could not play in the \"Paul Whiteman\" style bands they played in. When Bing Crosby would attend these sessions, the musicians would say he was \"jammin' the beat\", since he would clap on the one and the three. Thus these sessions became known as \"jam sessions\". Mezz Mezzrow also gives this more detailed and self-referential description, based on his experience at the jazz speakeasy known as the Three Deuces:\n\nThe New York scene during World War II was famous for its after-hours jam sessions. One of the most famous was the regular after-hours jam at Minton's Playhouse in New York City that ran in the 1940s and early 1950s. The jam sessions at Minton's were a fertile meeting place and proving ground for both established soloists like Ben Webster and Lester Young, and the younger jazz musicians who would soon become leading exponents of the bebop movement, including Thelonious Monk (Minton's house pianist), saxophone player Charlie Parker, and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie. The Minton's jams had competitive \"cutting contests\", in which soloists would try to keep up with the house band and outdo each other in improvisational skill.\n\nInfluenced by jazz, Cuban music saw the emergence of improvised jam sessions during the filin movement of the 1940s, where boleros, sones and other song types were performed in an extended form called \"descarga\". During the 1950s these \"descargas\" became the basis of a new genre of improvised jams based on the son montuno with notable jazz influences pioneered by the likes of Julio Gutiérrez and Cachao. During the 1960s, descargas played an important role in the development of salsa, especially the salsa dura style.\n\nAs the instrumental proficiency of pop and rock musicians improved in the 1960s and early 1970s, onstage jamming—free improvisation—also became a regular feature of rock music; bands such as Pink Floyd, Cream, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Deep Purple, The Who, the Grateful Dead, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Santana, King Crimson and the Allman Brothers Band would feature live improvised performances that could last anywhere between 10 and 20 minutes. However, they can be shorter on the recorded version.\n\nThough the Grateful Dead are often credited as being the first jam band, Cream incorporated long improvisations into their songs as early as 1967. However, the Grateful Dead allowed the \"jam band\" to become a genre unto itself; more recent bands following in their steps include Phish, moe., Umphreys Mcgee, and Widespread Panic, all of which feature extended improvisational sessions. Other bands, such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers also regularly perform live jam sessions. Progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria often end shows with a jam session to their song \"The Final Cut\" with different instruments.\n\nBluegrass music also features a tradition of jamming. Bluegrass jams happen in the parking lots and campgrounds of bluegrass festivals, in music stores, bars and restaurants and on stages. Bluegrass jams tend to be segregated by the skill level of the players. Slow jams for beginners provide an entry point. Open bluegrass jams are open to all comers, but the players in an open jam will expect a certain level of proficiency from participants. The abilities to hear chord progressions and keep time are essential, and the ability to play improvised leads that contain at least a suggestion of the melody is desirable. Jams that require advanced musical proficiency are generally private events, by invitation only.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2853880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2853880", "title": "John C. Morgan", "text": "John C. Morgan\n\nJohn Cary \"Red\" Morgan (August 24, 1914 – January 17, 1991) was a United States Army Air Forces pilot in World War II who received the Medal of Honor for his actions during a 1943 bombing run over Germany, which also inspired the character of 2nd Lieutenant Jesse Bishop in the novel and film \"Twelve O'Clock High\".\n\nBorn August 24, 1914, in Vernon, Texas, son of attorney Samuel A. Morgan Sr. and Verna Johnson Morgan, Morgan graduated from a military school in 1931 and then attended several colleges, including Amarillo College, New Mexico Military Institute, West Texas State Teachers College, and the University of Texas at Austin. While at Texas he learned to fly aircraft, and in 1934 dropped out of college. He worked in the Fiji Islands as a foreman on a pineapple plantation until 1938, when he returned to enlist as an aviation cadet in the U.S. Army Air Corps. However, because of his poor education record, he was refused enlistment. Working at an oil-drilling site for Texaco, Morgan suffered a broken neck in an industrial accident, and as a result was later classified 4-F by the Selective Service System.\n\nIn August, 1941, Morgan joined the Royal Canadian Air Force, and after completion of flight training in Saskatchewan, Ontario, and RAF Church Lawford, England, was posted as a Sergeant Pilot with RAF Bomber Command. On March 23, 1943, he was transferred to the U.S. Army Air Forces as a Flight Officer and assigned to the 92nd Bomb Group's 326th Bomb Squadron, RAF Alconbury, England.\n\nMorgan, on his fifth U.S. mission, was co-pilot of a crew flying a B-17F, ser. no. 42-29802, to a target in Hanover, Germany, on July 28, 1943. It was for his participation in this mission that he received the Medal of Honor (citation shown below in full), which was awarded on December 18, 1943.\n\nMorgan's experience began as his group formation neared the German coast. The B-17, nicknamed \"Ruthie II\", was attacked by a large number of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters and had part of its oxygen system to the gunners' positions in the rear of the aircraft knocked out. The first burst of fire also smashed the cockpit's windshield, damaged the interphone, and split open the skull of pilot Lt. Robert Campbell. The pilot's upper body slumped over his control wheel, causing it to start out of control. F/O Morgan seized the controls on his side and by sheer strength pulled the plane back into formation.\n\nThe disabled pilot continued to try to wrest the controls away from Morgan and smashed at the co-pilot with his fists, knocking some teeth loose and blackening both his eyes. Meanwhile, the top turret gunner was also seriously injured when a 20 mm shell tore off his left arm at the shoulder. He fell out of the turret position, and was found by the navigator bleeding to death. The navigator bailed the gunner out of the aircraft in a successful effort to save his life.\n\nUnknown to Morgan, the waist, tail and radio gunners became unconscious from lack of oxygen and were threatened with death by anoxia. Morgan, unable to call for assistance because of the damaged interphone, had to decide whether to turn back immediately or try to fly all the way to the target and back within the protection of the formation. He also had to decide whether or not to subject Campbell to anoxia by cutting off his oxygen to disable him. In spite of wild efforts by the fatally wounded pilot to seize the controls, Morgan chose to complete the mission and not cut off his pilot's oxygen supply.\n\nFor two hours he held position in the formation - flying with one hand, fighting off the pilot with the other. At length the navigator entered the flight deck and relieved the situation. The navigator and bombardier secured the dying pilot in the nose compartment of the airplane. F/O Morgan's B-17 reached the target at Hanover and successfully dropped its bombs. \nWith all his fuel gauges reading empty, Morgan landed the bomber at RAF Foulsham. Lt. Campbell died an hour and half later, and the five surviving gunners recovered from various degrees of frostbite. The B-17 was declared damaged beyond economical repair and never flew again.\n\nF/O Morgan transferred to the 482nd Bomb Group in October 1943 to fly B-17 H2X radar aircraft and was promoted to second lieutenant in November. He remained on combat duty, flying in all 25½ missions. On March 6, 1944, Morgan was the pilot of a B-17 leading the first major USAAF attack against Berlin when he was shot down and captured, held in Stalag Luft I, Barth, Germany, for the remainder of the war, the only person to become a POW after being awarded the Medal of Honor.\n\nIn 1948 Sy Bartlett and Beirne Lay, Jr. published their novel \"Twelve O'Clock High\" and used Morgan as a model for a primary character, Lt. Jesse Bishop. The wording of his actions appearing in his citation was used as dialogue in the script to describe the actions of Bishop under similar circumstances, and like Morgan, Bishop's character was awarded the Medal of Honor and later became a POW. The circumstances also became a featured part of the 1949 film adaptation.\n\nAfter the war, Morgan returned to work for Texaco in California selling aviation fuel. Called back to active duty when the Korean War broke out, he took a leave of absence from Texaco (1950 - 1953) and applied for combat duty. The Air Force denied his request but allowed him to fly cargo planes in the United States for two years. He completed his final year on active duty in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force. He retired from the Air Force, a lieutenant colonel. Morgan is survived by his only child Sam Morgan, who himself retired from the US Air Force after 20 plus years of service. Morgan has four grandchildren and three step grandchildren of which three are currently serving in the Army and Marine Corps. Mark, the oldest, has served in every operation since Desert Storm in 1991 minus the Balkan Campaigns. John, Wade and Rachel have all served one or more tours in Iraq or Afghanistan since the attacks on 9/11.\n\nMorgan died on January 17, 1991, from complications associated with Alzheimer's and a stroke and is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.\n\nWhen questioned of his valor and heroism, Morgan replied,\" There's no such thing as a hero. ... I was pushed into circumstances where I was forced to act. You can never say how you're going to react to something until it happens, but I think most people would have done the same.\"\n\nCitation:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty, while participating on a bombing mission over enemy-occupied continental Europe, 28 (\"sic\") July 1943. Prior to reaching the German coast on the way to the target, the B17 aircraft in which 2d Lt. (\"sic\") Morgan was serving as co-pilot was attacked by a large force of enemy fighters, during which the oxygen system to the tail, waist, and radio gun positions was knocked out. A frontal attack placed a cannon shell through the windshield, totally shattering it, and the pilot's skull was split open by a .303 caliber shell, leaving him in a crazed condition. The pilot fell over the steering wheel, tightly clamping his arms around it. 2d Lt. Morgan at once grasped the controls from his side and, by sheer strength, pulled the aircraft back into formation despite the frantic struggles of the semiconscious pilot. The interphone had been destroyed, rendering it impossible to call for help. At this time the top turret gunner fell to the floor and down through the hatch with his arm shot off at the shoulder and a gaping wound in his side. The waist, tail, and radio gunners had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen and, hearing no fire from their guns, the copilot believed they had bailed out. The wounded pilot still offered desperate resistance in his crazed attempts to fly the aircraft. There remained the prospect of flying to and over the target and back to a friendly base wholly unassisted. In the face of this desperate situation, 2d Lt. Officer Morgan made his decision to continue the flight and protect any members of the crew who might still be in the ship and for 2 hours he flew in formation with one hand at the controls and the other holding off the struggling pilot before the navigator entered the steering compartment and relieved the situation. The miraculous and heroic performance of 2d Lt. Morgan on this occasion resulted in the successful completion of a vital bombing mission and the safe return of his aircraft and crew.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "190884", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190884", "title": "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed", "text": "Khalid Sheikh Mohammed\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed (sometimes also spelled Khalid Shaikh Mohammed; among at least fifty pseudonyms; born March 1, 1964 or April 14, 1965) is a Pakistani Islamist militant held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges. He was named as \"the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks\" in the \"9/11 Commission Report\".\n\nSheikh Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization, leading al-Qaeda's propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001. He confessed to FBI and CIA agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years, but his interrogators' use of torture has caused many to question certain aspects of his confessions.\n\nMohammed was captured on March 1, 2003, in the Pakistani city of Rawalpindi by a combined operation of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Immediately after his capture, Mohammad was extraordinarily rendered to secret CIA prison sites in Afghanistan, then Poland, where he was interrogated by U.S. operatives. By December 2006 he had been transferred to military custody at Guantanamo Bay detention camp. In March 2007, after significant interrogations, Mohammed confessed to masterminding the September 11 attacks, the Richard Reid shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner, the Bali nightclub bombing in Indonesia, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the murder of Daniel Pearl, and various foiled attacks, as well as numerous other crimes. He was charged in February 2008 with war crimes and murder by a U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay detention camp which could carry the death penalty if convicted.\n\nIn 2012, a former military prosecutor criticized the proceedings as insupportable due to confessions gained under torture. A 2008 decision by the United States Supreme Court also drew into question the legality of the methods used to gain such admissions and the admissibility of such admissions as evidence in a criminal proceeding.\n\nAccording to official records, Sheikh Mohammed was born on April 14, 1965 (or March 1, 1964), in Balochistan, Pakistan. Some sources indicate his place of birth as Kuwait. His father was Sheikh Mohammed Ali Doustin Baluchi, a lay Deobandi preacher, who moved the family to Kuwait from Balochistan in the 1960s. His mother was Halema Mohammed. Mohammed is the uncle of Ramzi Yousef, who was convicted on terrorism charges for his part in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and Ammar Al Baluchi, who is accused of involvement in multiple terror plots.\n\nMohammed is fluent in Balochi, Urdu, Arabic, and English. He grew up and spent his formative years in Kuwait, as did his nephew Ramzi Yousef (three years his junior and the son of Mohammed's older sister).\n\nAccording to U.S. federal documents, in 1982 he had heard Abdul Rasul Sayyaf's speech in which a call for jihad against the Soviets was declared. At age 16, he joined the Muslim Brotherhood. After graduating from high school in 1983, Mohammad travelled to the United States and enrolled in Chowan University in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. He later transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and received a Bachelor of Science (BS) in mechanical engineering in 1986.\n\nThe following year he went to Peshawar, Pakistan, where he and his brothers, including Zahed, joined the mujahideen forces engaged in the Soviet–Afghan War. He attended the Sada training camp run by Sheikh Abdallah Azzam, and after that he worked for the magazine \"al-Bunyan al-Marsous\", produced by Sayyaf's rebel group, the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan. In 1992, he received a master's degree in Islamic Culture and History through correspondence classes from Punjab University in Pakistan. By 1993, Mohammad had married and moved his family to Qatar, where he took a position as project engineer with the Qatari Ministry of Electricity and Water. He began to travel to different countries from that time onward.\n\nThe United States 9/11 Commission Report notes that, \"By his own account, KSM's animus toward the United States stemmed not from his experiences there as a student, but rather from his violent disagreement with U.S. foreign policy favoring Israel.\" However, on August 29, 2009, \"The Washington Post\" reported from US intelligence sources that Mohammed's time in the U.S. contributed to his radicalisation.\n\nKSM's limited and negative experience in the United States—which included a brief jail stay because of unpaid bills—almost certainly helped propel him on his path to becoming a terrorist,\" according to this intelligence summary. \"He stated that his contact with Americans, while minimal, confirmed his view that the United States was a debauched and racist country.\"\n\nMohammed was in the Philippines in late 1994 and early 1995; he then identified as a Saudi or a Qatari plywood exporter and used the aliases \"Abdul Majid\" and \"Salem Ali.\"\n\nThe news agency Adnkronos reported in 2009 that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, under an assumed name, had traveled to Bosnia in 1995, as a humanitarian aid worker for Egyptian Relief. Adnkronos quoted the Sarajevo paper \"Daily Fokus\", reporting that local intelligence officials confirmed Mohammed had obtained Bosnian citizenship in November 1995. Those officials told \"Daily Fokus\" that Egyptian Relief was a front for the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nIn early 1996 Mohammed returned to Afghanistan to avoid capture by U.S. authorities. In his flight from Qatar, he was sheltered by Sheikh Abdullah Al Thani, who was the Qatari Minister of Religious Affairs in 1996.\n\nMohammed traveled to the Philippines in 1994 to work with his nephew Ramzi Yousef on the Bojinka plot, a Manila-based plot to destroy twelve commercial airliners flying routes between the United States, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. The 9/11 Commission Report says that \"this marked the first time KSM took part in the actual planning of a terrorist operation.\"\n\nBojinka plans included renting or buying a Cessna, packing it with explosives and crash landing it into CIA headquarters, with a backup plan to hijack the twelfth airliner in the air and use that instead. This information was reported in detail to the U.S. at the time.\n\nIn December 1994, Yousef had engaged in a test of a bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434 using only about ten percent of the explosives that were to be used in each of the bombs to be planted on US airliners. The test resulted in the death of a Japanese national on board a flight from the Philippines to Japan. Mohammed conspired with Yousef in the plot until it was uncovered on January 6, 1995. Yousef was captured February 7 of that same year.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was indicted on terrorism charges in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in January 1996 for his alleged involvement in Operation Bojinka, and was subsequently placed on the October 10, 2001, initial list of the FBI's twenty-two Most Wanted Terrorists.\n\nBy the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.\n\nBin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Abu Hafs al-Masri/Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.\n\nMohammed moved his family from Iran to Karachi, Pakistan, in 1997. That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden's invitation to move to Kandahar and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of Al Qaeda's media committee.\n\nThe first hijack plan that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed presented to the leadership of al-Qaeda called for several airplanes on both east and west coasts to be hijacked and flown into targets. His plan evolved from an earlier foiled plot known as the Bojinka plot (see above). Bin Laden rejected some potential targets suggested by Mohammed, such as the U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles.\n\nIn late 1998 or early 1999, Bin Laden gave approval for Mohammed to proceed to organize the plot. Meetings in early 1999 took place with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Osama bin Laden, and his military chief Mohammed Atef. Bin Laden led the plot and provided financial support. He was also involved in selecting the participants, including choosing Mohamed Atta as the lead hijacker. Khalid Shekih provided operational support, such as selecting targets and helping arrange travel for the hijackers. Atef directed the actions of the hijackers.\n\nAfter Atta was chosen as the leader of the mission, \"he met with Bin Laden to discuss the targets: the World Trade Center, which represented the U.S. economy; the Pentagon, a symbol of the U.S. military; and the U.S. Capitol, the perceived source of U.S. policy in support of Israel. The White House was also on the list, as Bin Laden considered it a political symbol and wanted to attack it as well.\" If any pilot could not reach his intended target, he was to crash the plane.\n\nAccording to testimony by Philip Zelikow, bin Laden was motivated by a desire to punish the US for supporting Israel and wanted to move up the attack date. Mohammed argued for ensuring the teams were prepared.\n\n[Bin Laden] allegedly told KSM it would be sufficient simply to down the planes and not hit specific targets. KSM stood his ground, arguing that the operation would not be successful unless the pilots were fully trained and the hijacking teams were larger.\n\nIn a 2002 interview with Al Jazeera journalist Yosri Fouda, Mohammed admitted that he and Ramzi bin al-Shibh were involved in the \"Holy Tuesday operation\". KSM, however, disputes this claim via his Personal Representative: \"I never stated to the Al Jazeera reporter that I was the head of the al-Qaeda military committee.\"\n\nIn April 2002 interview with \"Al Jazeera\" correspondent Yosri Fouda, KSM and Ramzi bin al-Shibh, described the preparations for 9/11 attacks and said that they first thought of \"striking at a couple of nuclear facilities\" in the USA but then \"it was eventually decided to leave out nuclear targets for now.\"\n\nAccording to a CNN interview with intelligence expert Rohan Gunaratna, \"Daniel Pearl was going in search of the al Qaeda network that was operational in Karachi, and it was at the instruction of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed that Daniel Pearl was killed.\" On October 12, 2006, \"Time\" magazine reported that \"KSM confessed under CIA interrogation that he personally committed the murder.\" On March 15, 2007, the Pentagon stated that Mohammed had confessed to the murder. The statement quoted Mohammed as saying, \"I decapitated with my blessed right hand the head of the American Jew, Daniel Pearl, in the city of Karachi, Pakistan. For those who would like to confirm, there are pictures of me on the Internet holding his head.\" This confession was gained under torture, and Mohammed listed many other crimes at the same time.\n\nAccording to an investigative report published in January 2011 by Georgetown University, the Federal Bureau of Investigation used vein matching to determine that the perpetrator in the video of the killing of Pearl was most likely Mohammed, notably through identifying a \"bulging vein\" running across his hand. Concerned that the confession obtained through waterboarding would not hold up in court, federal officials used this forensic evidence to bolster their case.\n\nOn September 11, 2002, members of Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) claimed to have killed or captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed during a raid in Karachi that resulted in bin al-Shibh's capture. This Pakistani claim was false.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Rawalpindi, Pakistan (about 20 km southwest of Islamabad), on March 1, 2003, by the Pakistani ISI, possibly in a joint action with the CIA's Special Activities Division paramilitary operatives and officers of the American Diplomatic Security Service. He has been in U.S. custody since that time.\n\nInitially Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was held in the CIA's Salt Pit (\"Cobalt\") prison in Afghanistan. After just a \"few minutes\" of questioning at \"Cobalt\", he was subject to \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". He was slapped, grabbed in the face, placed in stress positions, placed in standing sleep deprivation, doused with water, subject to rectal rehydration multiple times, without a determination of medical need.\n\nDuring 2003, Mohammad was held at a secret CIA prison, or black site, in Poland, where the CIA waterboarded him 183 times. He was then transferred to another secret CIA prison in Romania.\n\nIn September 2006, the U.S. government announced it had moved Mohammed from a secret CIA prison (or black site) to the military custody at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp.\n\nThe Red Cross, Human Rights Watch and Mohammed consider that the harsh interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, which he received from U.S. agents amount to torture. Mohammad was also subject to sleep deprivation for a period of seven-and-a-half days, during much of which he was forced to stand.\n\nAccording to later reports, Mohammed initially told American interrogators he would not answer any questions until he was provided with a lawyer, which was refused. He claims to have been kept naked for more than a month during his isolation and interrogations, and said he was \"questioned by an unusual number of female handlers\".\n\nA CIA document reveals that Jane Harman (D-CA) and Porter Goss (R-FL) of the House Intelligence Committee were briefed on July 13, 2004, by the CIA Deputy Director for Operations James Pavitt, General Counsel Scott Muller, and CIA Inspector General John L. Helgerson on the status of the interrogation process of Mohammed. By this date, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had been subjected to 183 applications of waterboarding.\n\nThe document states:\n\nA U.S. official has clarified that the \"183\" number represents the number of times water was poured onto Mohammed's face—not the number of times the CIA waterboarded him. According to a 2007 Red Cross report, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was subjected a total of \"five sessions of ill-treatment.\"\n\n\"The water was poured 183 times – there were 183 pours,\" the official explained, adding that \"each pour was a matter of seconds.\"\n\nOn October 12, 2004, Human Rights Watch reported that 11 suspects, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, had \"disappeared\" to a semi-secret prison in Jordan, and may have been tortured there under the direction of the CIA. At the time, Jordanian and American officials denied those allegations.\n\nOn February 5, 2008, the CIA Director Michael Hayden told a Senate committee that his agents had used waterboarding on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. A 2005 U.S. Justice Department memo released in April 2009 stated that Mohammed had undergone waterboarding 183 times in March 2003.\n\nIn October 2006 Mohammed described his mistreatment and torture in detention, including the waterboarding, to a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross. Mohammed said that he had provided a lot of false information, which he had supposed the interrogators wanted to hear, in order to stop the mistreatment. In the 2006 interview with the Red Cross, Mohammed claimed to have been waterboarded in five different sessions during the first month of interrogation in his third place of detention. While the Justice Department memos did not explain exactly what the numbers represented, a U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation programs explained the 183 figure represented the number of times water was applied to the detainee's face during the waterboarding sessions, rather than separate sessions.\n\nIn March 2007, after four years in captivity, including six months of detention and alleged torture at Guantanamo Bay, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed—as it was claimed by a Combatant Status Review Tribunal Hearing in Guantanamo Bay—confessed to masterminding the September 11 attacks, the Richard Reid shoe bombing attempt to blow up an airliner over the Atlantic Ocean, the Bali nightclub bombing in Indonesia, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and various foiled attacks. \"I was responsible for the 9/11 operation from A to Z,\" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement read Saturday during a Combatant Status Review Tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. His confession was read by a member of the U.S. military who is serving as his \"personal representative.\"\n\nAccording to the \"unclassified summary of evidence\" presented during the CSRT hearing, a computer hard drive seized during the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed contained the following:\n\nAt the hearing, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed said the computer belonged not to him, but to Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, arrested together with him.\n\nIn June 2008, a \"New York Times\" article, citing unnamed CIA officers, claimed that Mohammed had been held in a black site or secret facility in Poland near Szymany Airport, about 100 miles north of Warsaw. There he was interrogated under waterboarding before he began to \"cooperate.\"\n\nIn 2009 Mohammed described his actions and motivations in a document publicly released and known as \"The Islamic Response to the Government's Nine Accusations.\"\n\nIn April 2011, the British newspaper, \"The Telegraph\" said it received leaked documents regarding the Guantanamo Bay interrogations of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The documents cited Mohammed as saying that, if Osama Bin Laden is captured or killed by the Coalition of the Willing, an al-Qaeda sleeper cell would detonate a \"weapon of mass destruction\" in a \"secret location\" in Europe, and promised it would be \"a nuclear hellstorm\".\n\nAli Khan, the father of Majid Khan, another one of the 14 \"high-value detainees,\" released an affidavit on April 16, 2006, that reported that interrogators subjected Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's children, aged 6 and 8 years old, to abusive interrogation.\n\nKhan's affidavit quoted another of his sons, Mohammed Khan:\n\nOn September 6, 2006, then-American President George W. Bush confirmed, for the first time, that the CIA had held \"high-value detainees\" for interrogation in secret prisons around the world. He also announced that fourteen senior captives, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were being transferred from CIA custody, to military custody, at Guantanamo Bay detention camp and that these fourteen captives could now expect to face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.\n\nIn a September 29, 2006, speech, Bush stated:\n\nIn March 2007, Mohammed testified before a closed-door hearing in Guantánamo Bay. According to transcripts of the hearing released by the Pentagon, he said, \"I was responsible for the 9/11 operation, from A to Z.\" The transcripts also show him confessing to:\n\n\nOn March 15, 2007, BBC News reported that \"Transcripts of his testimony were translated from Arabic and edited by the U.S. Department of Defense to remove sensitive intelligence material before release. It appeared, from a judge's question, that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had made allegations of torture in US custody.\" In the Defense Department transcript, Mohammed said his statement was not made under duress but Mohammed and human rights advocates have alleged that he was tortured. CIA officials have previously told ABC News that \"Mohammed lasted the longest under waterboarding, two and a half minutes, before beginning to talk.\" Legal experts say this could taint all his statements. Forensic psychiatrist Michael Welner, M.D., an expert in false confessions, observed from the testimony transcript that his concerns about his family may have been far more influential in soliciting Mohammed's cooperation than any earlier reported mistreatment.\n\nOne CIA official cautioned that \"many of Mohammed's claims during interrogation were 'white noise' designed to send the U.S. on wild goose chases or to get him through the day's interrogation session.\" For example, according to Mike Rogers, a former FBI agent and the top Republican on the terrorism panel of the House Intelligence Committee, he admitted responsibility for the Bali nightclub bombing, but his involvement \"could have been as small as arranging a safe house for travel. It could have been arranging finance.\" Mohammed also made the admission that he was \"responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center Operation,\" which killed six and injured more than 1,000 when a bomb was detonated in an underground garage, Mohammed did not plan the attack, but he may have supported it. Michael Welner noted that by offering legitimate information to interrogators, Mohammed had secured the leverage to provide misinformation as well.\n\nIn an article discussing the reliability of Khalid's confession and the motive for giving misinformation under torture, Ali Soufan, a former FBI special agent with considerable experience interrogating al-Qaeda operatives, pointed out that:\n\nHis words are echoed by the US Army Training Manual's section on interrogation, which suggests that:\n\nAs an example of this the article discloses that although the George W. Bush administration made claims that the water-boarding (simulated drowning) of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed produced vital information that allowed them to break up a plot to attack the U.S. Bank Tower (formerly Library Tower and First Interstate Bank World Center) in Los Angeles in 2002, this has been proven to be untrue. In 2002 Sheikh Mohammed was busy evading capture in Pakistan. Likewise the claim by the Obama administration that torture of Kahlid Mohammed led to the lead in finding Osama Bin Laden has also been shown to be false. According to U.S. Senator John McCain, \"The trail to bin Laden did not begin with a disclosure from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was waterboarded 183 times ... not only did the use of 'enhanced interrogation techniques' on Khalid Sheikh Mohammed not provide us with key leads on bin Laden's courier, Abu Ahmed; it actually produced false and misleading information.\"\n\nMohammed has made at least 31 confessions:\n\nAfter Mohammed arrived at Guantánamo, a team of FBI and military interrogators tried to elicit from him the same confessions that the CIA had obtained about the 9/11 plot, but by using only legal means of interrogation. By 2008, the Bush Administration believed that this so-called Clean Team had compiled sufficient evidence to charge Mohammed and the others with capital murder.\n\nThe Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the \"high-value detainees\" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites, had been officially classified as \"enemy combatants\". Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only \"\"illegal\" enemy combatants\" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.\n\nOn March 19, 2007, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh's lawyers cited Mohammed's confession in defense of their client.\n\nAhmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, also known as Sheikh Omar, was sentenced to death in a Pakistani court for the murder of Daniel Pearl. Omar's lawyers recently announced that they planned to use Mohammed's confession in an appeal. They had always acknowledged that Omar played a role in Pearl's murder, but argue that Mohammed was the actual murderer.\n\nIn 2009, the French government decided to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \"in absentia\" on terrorism charges with respect to the Ghriba synagogue bombing on the Tunisian island of Djerba in 2002, which killed 14 German tourists, five Tunisians and two French nationals. They intended to charge him along with the captured German national Christian Ganczarski and Tunisian Walid Nawar. French judges later decided to separate Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's case from those of Ganczarski and Nawar and try him separately at a later date.\n\nOn February 11, 2008, the United States Department of Defense charged Mohammed, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Walid Bin Attash for the September 11, 2001 attacks under the military commission system, as established under the Military Commissions Act of 2006. They have reportedly been charged with the murder of almost 3000 people, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war. The charges against them list 169 overt acts allegedly committed by the defendants in furtherance of the September 11 events.\n\nThe charges include 2,973 individual counts of murder—one for each person killed in the 9/11 attacks. The prosecution is seeking the death penalty, which would require the unanimous agreement of the commission judges.\n\nHuman rights groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Center for Constitutional Rights, and U.S. military defense lawyers have criticised the military commissions for lacking due process for a fair trial. Critics generally argue for the trials to be held in a federal district court, with defendants treated as criminal suspects, or by court-martial as a prisoner under the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit civilian trials for prisoners of war. Mohammed could face the death penalty under any of these systems.\n\n, the case is progressing through the legal system.\n\nIn \"Boumediene v. Bush\" (2008), the United States Supreme Court ruled that detainees had the right of access to US federal courts to petition under habeas corpus to challenge their detentions, and that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 were flawed. A revised Military Commissions Act was passed by Congress in 2009 to address court concerns.\n\nOn September 9, 2009, photographs of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ammar al Baluchi were published on the Internet and widely in US and international media. Camp authorities have strict controls over the taking and distribution of images of the Guantanamo captives. Journalists and VIPs visiting Guantanamo are not allowed to take any pictures that show the captives' faces. Journalists may see \"high value\" captives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed only when they are in the court room, where cameras are not allowed. But, on September 9, 2009, independent counter-terrorism researchers found new images of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his nephew Ammar al Baluchi on \"jihadist websites\". According to Carol Rosenberg, writing in \"The Miami Herald\": \"The pictures were taken in July, said International Committee of the Red Cross spokesman Bernard Barrett, under an agreement with prison camp staff that lets Red Cross delegates photograph detainees and send photos to family members.\"\n\nIn November 2014, a Turkish manufacturer of over the counter hair removal cream was found to be using an image of a disheveled Mohammed in ads for their product.\nThey asserted they had no idea whose image they were using in their ad. They asserted the image had been widely used to advertise insomnia cures.\n\nIn January 2014, a 36-page \"nonviolence manifesto\" written by KSM was declassified and released by the government. The title is \"Khalid Sheikh Mohammad's Statement to the Crusaders of the Military Commissions in Guantanamo\". The document outlines 3 parts, but appears to be just the first section, describing \"the path to happiness\". The subject writes to his captors and appears interested in converting his wider audience to Islam. The author has utilized cultural criticisms, theological, and historical references to clarify a rationale for Westerners to follow Islam. The notes contain eight books with three Western authors and penciled initials with the date October 31, 2013.\n\nKhalid Sheikh Mohammad has participated as a witness in the trials of two alleged al-Qaeda members, Zacarias Moussaoui and Salim Hamdan. LA Times reporter Richard Serrano wrote:\n\n\"In 2006, his interrogation summaries were read aloud in the capital murder trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, and Moussaoui was spared the death penalty. Two years later, different Mohammed statements were read in a military commission trial, or tribunal, that led to the release from Guantanamo Bay of Osama bin Laden's chauffeur, Salim Hamdan.\"\n\nStanly Cohen, an attorney for Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, requested to interview Mohammad, who they described as \"the most qualified person alive\" to assist in Abu Gaith's defense. Mohammad, through his attorney David Nevin, agreed to be interviewed, but only \"in the absence of government personnel whether physically present or by listening or recording remotely.\"\n\nMohammed instead drafted a 14-page statement response to 451 interrogatories submitted by Cohen. In the response, Mohammad called Abu Ghaith, a \"pious man\" and \"spellbinding speaker\" who, to the best of his knowledge, did not play any military role in al-Qaeda operations and had no military training. Mohammed argued that Western foreign policy has been hypocritical in that it allowed for the rise of the Mujahideen in the Soviet War, but that Western media has since branded the Mujahideen \"terrorists\" or \"foreign fighters.\" He further claimed that the Taliban's strict Islamic rule had restored security to Afghanistan in the 1990s. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan ruled that neither Mohammad's statement nor testimony were relevant to Abu Ghaith's trial, and thus inadmissible.\n\nThe crime documentary series \"Mugshots\" released an episode, \"KSM's Confessions\" which tracks the terrorists Mohammad from New York to Pakistan.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5530973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5530973", "title": "M. E. Clifton James", "text": "M. E. Clifton James\n\nMeyrick Edward Clifton James (April 1898 – 8 May 1963) was an actor and soldier, with a resemblance to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. This was used by British intelligence as part of a deception campaign during the Second World War.\n\nClifton James was born in Perth, Western Australia, the youngest son of notable Australian public servant John Charles Horsey James and his wife Rebecca Catherine Clifton.\n\nAfter serving in the Royal Fusiliers during the First World War, and seeing action at the Battle of the Somme, he took up acting, \"starting at 15 shillings weekly with Fred Karno, who put Chaplin on the road to fame.\" At the outbreak of the Second World War he volunteered his services to the British Army as an entertainer. Instead of being assigned to ENSA as he had hoped, on 11 July 1940 James was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Pay Corps and eventually posted to Leicester. Here, his acting seemed to be limited to his membership of the Pay Corps Drama and Variety Group. In 1944 his resemblance to Montgomery was spotted, and he was employed to pretend to be the general as part of a campaign designed to deceive the Germans in the lead-up to D-Day.\n\nAbout seven weeks before D-Day in 1944, Lieutenant-Colonel J V B Jervis-Reid noticed James's resemblance to Montgomery while he was reviewing photographs in a newspaper. James, it seemed, had 'rescued' a failing patriotic show by appearing in it, quite briefly, as 'Monty'. MI5 decided to exploit the resemblance to confuse German intelligence. James was contacted by Lieutenant-Colonel David Niven, who worked for the Army's film unit, and was asked to come to London on the pretext of making a film.\n\nWhen Niven explained that it was about something different, James supposedly burst into tears because he thought he had been exposed as a bigamist, who was receiving a double marriage allowance. Like many of Niven's anecdotes, this one is viewed with scepticism.\n\nThe ruse was part of a wider deception which aimed to divert troops from Northern France, by convincing the Germans that an Allied invasion of Southern France (Operation Dragoon) would precede a northern invasion.\n\nThe plan was code-named Operation \"Copperhead\" and James was assigned to Montgomery's staff to learn his speech and mannerisms. Despite the problems that he had with alcohol (Montgomery was teetotal), and the differences in personality, the project continued. He also had to give up smoking. Clifton James had lost his right-hand middle finger in the First World War and so a prosthetic finger was made.\n\nOn 25 May 1944, James flew from RAF Northolt to Gibraltar on-board Churchill's private aircraft. During a reception at the Governor-General's house, hints were made about \"Plan 303\", a plan to invade Southern France. German intelligence picked this up and ordered agents to find out what they could about \"Plan 303\". James then flew to Algiers where over the next few days he made a round of public appearances with General Maitland Wilson, the Allied commander in the Mediterranean theatre. He was then secretly flown to Cairo where he stayed until the invasion in Normandy was well under way. He then returned to his job after an absence of five weeks.\n\nVarious reasons were put forward for the speedy conclusion of the operation (including the suggestion that James was seen in Gibraltar smoking and drunk), though the most likely explanation is the one put forward by Dennis Wheatley (who was part of the British deception efforts during the war) in \"The Deception Planners\" published in the 1980s. In it, he states that the operation was wound up successfully, its purpose accomplished. The effectiveness of the deception is hard to assess. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint.\n\nAfter being demobilised in June 1946, he was unable to find theatrical employment and was obliged to apply for unemployment benefits to support his wife and two children in London.\n\nIn 1954, James published his exploits in a book entitled \"I Was Monty's Double\" (released in the US as \"The Counterfeit General Montgomery\"). The book became the basis for the script of the 1958 film starring John Mills and Cecil Parker with James playing himself and Montgomery. The script was 'tweaked' for effect; 'Operation Copperhead' became 'Operation Hambone', and additional elements of comedy, danger and intrigue were added. James also appeared in a short cameo (and non-speaking) appearance as Field Marshal Montgomery in the 1957 film \"High Flight\", starring Ray Milland.\n\nOn 20 January 1959, James appeared on an episode of the TV series \"To Tell the Truth\".\n\nJames died on 8 May 1963 at his home on Thorn Road in Worthing, Sussex, aged 65.\n\n\n\n\n"}

In many countries, New Year's Eve is celebrated at evening social gatherings, where many people dance, eat, drink alcoholic beverages, and watch or light fireworks to mark the new year. Some Christians attend a watchnight service. The celebrations generally go on past midnight into New Year's Day, 1 January.\n\nSamoa, Tonga and Kiritimati (Christmas Island), part of Kiribati, are the first places to welcome the New Year while American Samoa and Baker Island in the United States of America are among the last.\n\nIn Algeria, New Year's Eve (; \"\") is usually celebrated with family and friends. In the largest cities, such as Algiers, Constantine, Annaba, Oran, Sétif and Béjaïa, there are large celebrations which may feature concerts, late-night partiying, firecrackers, fireworks at midnight and sparklers and shouts of \"\"Bonne année !\".\n\nThe Martyrs' Memorial and the Grand-Post Place in Algiers are the main attraction for the majority of Algerians during the celebration; while some others prefer spending this special night outside the country, generally in Tunis or Paris.\n\nAt , the President's message of greetings to Algerians is read on TV. EPTV network airs a yearly New Year's Eve entertainment show, variying its name, hosts and guests, which features sketches and musical performances. Popular films are also broadcast.\n\nAt home or at restaurants, a special type of pastry cake, called \"la bûche\"\" is eaten, and black coffee or soda is drunk with it, few minutes before the New Year's countdown.\n\nOn New Year's Day (\"le jour de l'an\"), people, especially children, write their \"New Year's letter\" on decorated paper, called \"Carte de bonne année\", to their parents and relatives, featuring their resolutions and wishes.\n\nIn Egypt the new year is celebrated with fireworks, fire crackers, smashing glass bottles or breaking things on the street also.\n\nIn Ghana, many people celebrate New Year's Eve by going to Church; others go to nightclubs, pubs, or take to the street to celebrate. At midnight, fireworks are displayed across various cities of Ghana, especially in Accra and Tema.\n\nIn Morocco, New Year's Eve (—\"head of the year\") is celebrated in the company of family and friends.

At midnight, fireworks are displayed across Ain Diab, in the corniche of Casablanca.\n\nIn Nigeria, the New Year's Eve is often celebrated by going to Church; others go to nightclubs, and parties organised by individuals, communities or State government like the Lagos Countdown. The Lagos Countdown is an event in Nigeria, created to increase tourism and making Lagos a premium destination for business and leisure. The event kicks off in December and lasts till 1 January. It is attended by an average of 100,000 people. The event takes place at the Eko Atlantic city, beside the Barbeach attracting thousands of domestic and foreign tourists who are entertained every evening by different artists...\n\nIn South Sudan, people attend church services at many churches in Juba. The service begins at 9PM. At the stroke of midnight, people sing the famous carol, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing to mark the end and beginning of the year with a blessing. The service ends at 12:30AM.\n\nTraditional celebrations in Argentina include a family dinner of traditional dishes, including \"vitel tonné\", \"asado\", \"sandwiches de miga\", \"piononos\". Like dessert: \"turrón\", \"mantecol and \"pan dulce\".\n\nJust before midnight, people flock to the streets to enjoy fireworks and light firecrackers. The fireworks can be seen in any terrace. The first day of the New Year is celebrated at midnight with cider or champagne. People wish each other a happy New Year, and sometimes share a toast with neighbours. Parties often continue until dawn.\n\nThe celebration is during the summer, like in many South American countries, so it's normal to see many families in the New Year at tourist centers of the Argentine Atlantic coast (Mar del Plata, Necochea, Villa Gesell, Miramar, etc.).\n\nThe New Year (), is one of Brazil's main holidays. It officially marks the beginning of the summer holidays, which last until Carnival. Brazilians traditionally have a copious meal with family or friends at home, in restaurants or private clubs, and consume alcoholic beverages. Champagne is traditionally drunk. Those spending New Year's Eve at the beach usually dress in white, to bring good luck into the new year. Fireworks and eating grapes or lentils are customs associated with the holiday.\n\nThe beach at Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro is ranked among the top 10 New Year Fireworks display. The combination of live concerts, a spectacular fireworks display and millions of revelers combine to make the Copacabana's New Year's party one of the best in the world. In addition, the celebrations are broadcast on TV, the most famous being the \"Adues A Tudo Isso\" on Rede Globo.\n\nIn other regions, different events also take place. The most famous are on the edge of coastal cities, such as Copacabana. In the Northeast, in Fortaleza, the party is in Iracema Beach, and in Salvador, the change of year happens in a great music festival. In the South, the most famous festivities on the coast take place in Santa Catarina: on the Beira-mar Norte Avenue, in Florianópolis, and in the Central Beach of Balneário Camboriú.\nOther celebrations that stand out even from the sea are those of Manaus, in the northern state of Amazonas, and the Paulista Avenue, in São Paulo, the largest city in the country, and Ministries Esplanade, in the capital Brasília. The party attracts more than one million people. It features fireworks and live music shows.\n\nThe city of São Paulo hosts the Saint Silvester Marathon () which traverses streets between Paulista Avenue and the downtown area.\n\nNew Year traditions and celebrations in Canada vary regionally. New Year's Eve (also called \"New Year's Eve Day\" or \"Veille du Jour de l'An\" in French) is generally a social holiday. In many cities, such as Toronto, Ottawa and Niagara Falls in Ontario, Edmonton and Calgary in Alberta, Vancouver, British Columbia and Montreal, Quebec, there are large celebrations which may feature concerts, late-night partying, sporting events, and fireworks, with free public transit service during peak party times in most major cities. In some areas, such as in rural Quebec, people ice fish in the old days. Since 2000, the highlight of New Year's Eve celebrations is in Montreal's old port, which comes alive with concerts that take place and fireworks at midnight.\n\nFrom 1956 to 1976, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians serenaded Canada on the CBC, via a feed from CBS, from the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Park Avenue in New York City. After Lombardo's death in 1977, the Royal Canadians continued on CBC and CBS until 1978.\n\nIn 1992, the sketch comedy troupe Royal Canadian Air Farce began airing its annual New Year's Eve special \"Year of the Farce\" on CBC Television, which features sketches lampooning the major events and news stories of the year. The 1992 edition was presented as a one-off special, but served as a pilot for a regular Air Farce series that\npremiered the following year, and ran until 2008. \"Year of the Farce\" episodes continued to air annually as part of the series, while the 2008 edition doubled as the program's series finale. One-off \"Year of the Farce\" specials have continued to air on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day since, featuring members of the original cast.\n\nSimilarly, the CBC's French language network Ici Radio-Canada Télé airs its own yearly New Year's Eve comedy special, \"Bye Bye\". Unlike \"Year of the Farce\", \"Bye Bye\" has been presented by various comedians; originally running from 1968 to 1998, it was revived in 2006 by the Québécois troupe Rock et Belles Oreilles. Its 2008 edition, hosted and co-produced by Québécois television personality Véronique Cloutier, was criticized for featuring sketches that viewers perceived as offensive, including sketches making fun of English Canadians and then American president-elect Barack Obama.\n\nNew Year's Eve is celebrated in Chile by the observation of traditional rituals, such as wearing yellow underwear and yellow clothing. It is said to restore vitality to your life. People who want to travel walk the streets with a suitcase in hand, others hold money in their hand or place coins at their door for good fortune in the new year. Celebrations include a family dinner with special dishes, usually lentils for good luck, and twelve grapes to symbolize wishes for each month of the coming year. Family celebrations usually last until midnight, then some continue partying with friends until dawn. In Chile's capital Santiago, thousands of people gather at the Entel Tower to watch the countdown to midnight and a fireworks display.\n\nThere are several fireworks shows across the country. Over one million spectators attend the most popular, the \"Año Nuevo en el Mar\", in Valparaiso. Since 2000, the sale of fireworks to individuals has been illegal, meaning fireworks can now only be observed at major displays.\n\nMany people also travel to Easter Island, off Chile's coast, to welcome the New Year.\n\nIn Colombia it is a traditional celebration. There are many traditions across the country. Included among these traditions are: a family dinner with special dishes, fireworks, popular music, wearing special or new clothes, eating empanadas and different parties. With each stroke of the clock until midnight, the families eat grapes.\n\nIn Costa Rica, families usually gather around 8 pm for parties that last until 1 or 2 am, the next day. There are several traditions among Costa Rican families, including eating 12 grapes representing 12 wishes for the new year, and running across the street with luggage to bring new trips and adventures in the upcoming year.\n\nIn El Salvador, New Year's Eve is spent with families. Family parties start around 5:00 pm, and last until 1:00 to 3:00 am, the following day. Families eat dinner together and sing traditional New Year's Eve songs, such as \"Cinco para las Doce\". After the dinner, individuals light fireworks and continue partying outside. A radio station broadcasts a countdown to midnight. When the clock strikes midnight, fireworks are lit across the country. People start exchanging hugs and wishes for the new year.\n\nA New Year's Eve tradition in Ecuador is for men to dress haphazardly in drag (clowny looking make-up, cheap colorful wigs, very hairy legs in miniskirts) for New Year's Eve representing the \"widow\" of the year that has passed. The \"widows\" then go to the streets and stop each car that passes on that particular street in order to parody some form of sexy dancing. Large crowds would gather around to watch and laugh at the entertainment and the drivers are forced to give the \"widows\" some coins in order to obtain passage through the street.\n\nThere are also traditional family events and meals and modern celebrations such as hosting parties and going to nightclubs. People usually eat grapes and drink Champagne with close family members and friends.\n\nThe main event takes place at midnight where fireworks are lit along with thousands of life-size effigies called \"Año Viejo\". Most every local family creates the effigy from paper scraps, old clothes or purchases it altogether. They place just outside the front of their home. The effigy represents things you disliked from the previous year and are made to look like famous celebrities, politicians, public servants, cartoons, etc. They are burnt right at midnight to shed the old year and represent a new beginning. Some of the braver Ecuadorians jump through these burning effigies 12 times to represent a wish for every month.\n\nIn Guatemala, banks close on New Year's Eve, and businesses close at noon. In the town of Antigua, people usually gather at the Santa Catalina Clock Arch to celebrate New Year's Eve (). In Guatemala City the celebrations are centered on Plaza Mayor. Firecrackers are lit starting at sundown, continuing without interruption into the night. Guatemalans wear new clothes for good fortune and eat a grape with each of the twelve chimes of the bell during the New Year countdown, while making a wish with each one.\n\nThe celebrations include religious themes which may be either Mayan or Catholic. Catholic celebrations are similar to those at Christmas. Gifts are left under the tree on Christmas morning by the Christ Child for the children, but parents and adults do not exchange gifts until New Year's Day.\n\nMexicans celebrate New Year's Eve, (Spanish: \"Vispera de Año Nuevo\") by eating a grape with each of the twelve chimes of a clock's bell during the midnight countdown, while making a wish with each one. Mexican families decorate homes and parties in colors that represent wishes for the upcoming year: red encourages an overall improvement of lifestyle and love, yellow encourages blessings of improved employment conditions, green for improved financial circumstances, and white for improved health. Mexican sweet bread is baked with a coin or charm hidden in the dough. When the bread is served, the recipient of the slice with the coin or charm is said to be blessed with good luck in the New Year. Another tradition is to make a list of all the bad or unhappy events over the past 12 months; before midnight, this list is thrown into a fire, symbolizing the removal of negative energy from the new year. At the same time, they are expressed for all the good things during the year that is ending so that they will continue in the new year.\n\nMexicans celebrate with a late-night dinner with their families, the traditional meal being turkey or pork loin. Afterwards many people attend parties outside the home, for example, in night clubs. In Mexico City there is a street festival on New Year's Eve centered on the Zocalo, the city's main square. Celebrations include firecrackers, fireworks and sparklers and shouts of \"¡Feliz Año Nuevo!\"\n\nIn Puerto Rico, New Year's Eve is celebrated with friends and family. The Puerto Rico Convention Center in San Juan is the main attraction for Puerto Ricans during the celebration. It has Latin music and fireworks at midnight along with the signature song \"Auld Lang Syne\" in Spanish.\n\nDuring New Year's Eve in Suriname, the Surinamese population goes into cities' commercial districts to watch fireworks shows. This is a spectacle based on the famous red-firecracker-ribbons. The bigger stores invest in these firecrackers and display them in the streets. Every year the length of them is compared, and high praises are held for the company that has managed to import the largest ribbon. These celebrations start at 10 am and finish the next day. The day is usually filled with laughter, dance, music, and drinking. When the night starts, the big street parties are already at full capacity. The most popular fiesta is the one that is held at café 't Vat in the main tourist district. The parties there stop between 10 and 11 pm after which the people go home to light their \"pagaras\" (red-firecracker-ribbons) at midnight. After midnight, the parties continue and the streets fill again until daybreak.\n\nIn Port of Spain the tradition is to celebrate in one's yard with friends, family and neighbors, and eat and drink till sunrise. At midnight the city becomes festive with fireworks in every direction. The celebration only starts at midnight. Music is heard from all the houses and bars, nightclubs, street parties, Soca raves. The people are celebrating not only the new year but the beginning of the carnival season as well.\n\nIn the United States, New Year's Eve is celebrated with formal parties and concerts, family-oriented activities, and large public events such as firework shows and \"drops\".\n\nThe most prominent celebration in the country is the \"ball drop\" held at New York City's Times Square, which was inspired by the time balls that were formerly used as a time signal. At 11:59 p.m. ET, an , ball (which is adorned with crystal panels and an LED lighting system) is lowered down a -high pole on the roof of One Times Square, reaching the roof of the building 60 seconds later at midnight. The event has been held since 1907, and has seen an average attendance of 1,000,000 yearly. Since 2009, the ball itself has been displayed atop the building year-round. The event has inspired similar \"drops\" outside of New York City, using either a ball or another item that symbolizes local culture, geography, or history (such as Atlanta's Peach Drop, reflecting Georgia's identity as the \"Peach State\").\n\nU.S. media coverage of New Year's Eve festivities have historically been centered on New York City; in 1929, Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians' began to hold an annual New Year's Eve radio broadcast from the Roosevelt Hotel. They were well known for the band's signature performance of \"Auld Lang Syne\" at midnight, which helped make the standard synonymous with the New Year's holiday. The broadcast moved to CBS television from 1956 to 1976, adding coverage of the ball drop, and moved to the Waldorf-Astoria ballroom in 1959. Following Lombaro's death, Dick Clark's \"New Year's Rockin' Eve\" (which premiered for 1973 on NBC, and moved to ABC for 1975) became the dominant New Year's Eve special on U.S. television (especially among younger viewers), with Clark hosting it (as well as ABC's special coverage of the year 2000) for 33 straight years. After suffering a stroke in December 2004, Clark missed the 2005 edition, and he retired as full-time host in favor of Ryan Seacrest for 2006 due to a lingering speech impediment. Clark continued making limited appearances on the special until his death in 2012.\n\nOther notable celebrations include the Las Vegas Strip's \"America's Party\", where streets are closed to vehicle traffic on the evening of New Year's Eve, and a fireworks show is held at midnight across multiple buildings.

In the English-speaking world, Watch Night can be traced back to John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, who learned the custom from the Moravian Brethren who came to England in the 1730s. Moravian congregations still observe the Watch Night service on New Year's Eve. Watch Night took on special significance to African Americans on New Year's Eve 1862, as slaves anticipated the arrival of 1 January 1863, when Lincoln had announced he would sign the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nRadio specials give a countdown and announce the New Year.

During the day, children sing the New Year's carols to be given money or treats. Then, it is time to have family lunch or dinner. In the evening, people cook a pie named \"King's pie (Vassilopita locally)\", which is a cake flavored with almonds. Following tradition, they put a coin wrapped in aluminium foil inside the pie.\n\nDuring the family dinner, the hostess puts some of her jewelry in a plate and serves it in the side of the table, as a symbol of the coming year's prosperity.\nAfter the dinner is over, the dishes are not washed until the next day. The reason for that is that Saint Vassilis (Greek Santa Claus) is awaited during the New Year's Eve and it is considered common courtesy to leave some food for the traveler who visits the house to bring the presents during the night.\n\nWhen midnight arrives, the families count down and then they turn off all the lights and reopen their eyes to \"enter the year with a new light\". After the fireworks show, they cut the \"Vassilopita\" and serve it. The person that gets the wrapped coin is the lucky person of the day and he is also blessed for the rest of the year.

An ancient tradition in southern regions which is rarely followed today was disposing of old or unused items by dropping them from the window.\n\nDinner is traditionally eaten with relatives and friends. It often includes zampone or cotechino (a meal made with pig's trotters or entrails), and lentils.

It is baked from a soft, white dough, with raisins, various nuts and crystallised fruit. Inside is hidden the characteristic \"fava\" (broad bean). Tradition dictates that whoever finds the \"fava\" has to pay for the \"Bolo-Rei\" next year. Initially, a small prize (usually a small metal toy) was also included within the cake. However, the inclusion of the prize was forbidden by the European Union for safety reasons. The Portuguese brought the recipe of the \"Gateau des Rois\" from France in the second half of the 19th century. To this day, this recipe is a very well kept secret.\n\nIn Lisbon the New Year is celebrated with a grand concert.

The origin of this holiday in Russia derives from Christmas. Christmas was also a major holiday in Russia until it was banned, with all other religious holidays, by the Communist Party. To compensate for the absence of Christmas, New Year's was celebrated as much as Christmas was, but without the religious aspect of the holiday and lot of a Christmas attributes were repurposed, such as Christmas tree, which became a New Year tree. Even after the fall of the Soviet Union, New Year's is still celebrated in Russia and has become a Russian tradition. There is an old superstition that if the first visitor (especially an unexpected one) on 1 January is a male, the year will be good. People also try to start the new year without debts.\nThe celebration usually starts one or two hours before midnight. A common tradition is to \"say farewell to the old year\" by remembering the most important events of the last twelve months. At five minutes to midnight most people watch the president's New Year speech on TV and watch popular films or New Year TV shows before and after midnight. There is a tradition to listen to the Kremlin clock bell ringing twelve times on the radio or on TV, which is followed by the national anthem.

The actual countdown is primarily followed from the clock on top of the Casa de Correos building in Puerta del Sol Square in Madrid. It is traditional to eat Twelve Grapes, one on each chime of the clock. This tradition has its origins in 1909, when grape growers in Alicante thought of it as a way to cut down on the large production surplus they had had that year. Nowadays, the tradition is followed by almost every Spaniard, and the twelve grapes have become synonymous with the New Year. After the clock has finished striking twelve, people greet each other and toast with sparkling wine such as cava or champagne, or with cider. The song \"Un año más,\" by the Spanish group Mecano, is frequently played.\n\nEarlier in the evening at around 20:00, there is a 10k run called San Silvestre Vallecana, which starts on Paseo de la Castellana, next to Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, and ends at the Vallecas Stadium. Professional runners come to Madrid for this 10k.\n\nAfter the family dinner and the grapes, many young people attend \"cotillones de nochevieja\" parties (named for the Spanish word \"cotillón\", which refers to party supplies like confetti, party blowers, and party hats) at pubs, clubs, and similar places.

Ukrainian families traditionally install spruce trees at home, the equivalent of a Christmas tree. Families gather to eat a large feast and reflect on the past year. They have a large celebration, make toasts, and make wishes for a happy New Year. Families give presents to their friends as well as informal acquaintances. As Ukrainians are traditionally a closely knit community, it is seen as a taboo to not give presents to those the family associates with. Children stay up until midnight, waiting for the New Year. During these celebrations many Ukrainians tune to special New Year shows, which have become a long-standing tradition for the Ukrainian TV. And just before midnight the President of Ukraine gives his New Year's message to the nation, and when the clock strikes 12, the National Anthem Shche ne vmerla Ukraina is played in all TV and radio stations as well as in Independence Square in Kiev and other cities where holiday celebrations are held.\n\nThe first New year dish in Ukraine which associates with the New year for every Ukrainian person is the Olivier salad. It has become the main «character» of many jokes and anecdotes. There are several versions about where the name Olivier comes from, but most people say that it appeared thanks to the French chef Olivier, who lived in the USSR in the 1960s and was the owner of a French restaurant in Moscow. He was the first one to cook this dish. Nowadays this salad is also called Russian, potato and meat salad.\n\nNew Year is often considered a \"pre-celebration\" for Greek Catholics and Eastern Orthodox living in Eastern Europe, primarily in Ukraine, since Christmas is celebrated on 7 January.\n\nThe most prominent New Year's celebration in England is that of Central London, where the arrival of midnight is greeted with the chimes of Big Ben.

The second installment took place at Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan, on June 8 and 9, 2013. The festival was a financial disaster, which led to its cancellation after only two installments.\n\nIt was announced that Belle Isle would be the site of the Orion Music + More Festival in 2013. On December 26, 2012, Detroit Councilman Ken Cockrel Jr. confirmed rumors that the city is in the process of confirming 2014 and 2015 as well to take place at Belle Isle.

{"id": "53791565", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53791565", "title": "Pad Man (film)", "text": "Pad Man (film)\n\nPad Man is a 2018 Indian biographical drama film directed and written by R. Balki, featuring Akshay Kumar, Sonam Kapoor and Radhika Apte in lead roles. It is based on the short story \"The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land\" in Twinkle Khanna's book \"The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad\", which is inspired by the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a social activist from Tamil Nadu who introduced low-cost sanitary pads. The film was released theatrically on 9 February 2018.\n\nThe story starts with the marriage of Lakshmikant \"Laxmi\" Chauhan (Akshay Kumar) and Gayatri (Radhika Apte). Laxmi is deeply in love with his wife and will do anything for her comfort and happiness. When Gayatri is temporarily banished from the household during her menstrual periods, Laxmi is caught unaware due to his lack of knowledge about the subject. He gets worried on seeing Gayatri using a dirty rag during her periods. Gayatri tells him he should not interfere in this feminine topic. Undeterred, Laxmi buys sanitary pads for his wife, which are rather costly. Gayatri tells him to return it, as using such costly napkins means cutting off milk expenses. Crestfallen, Laxmi goes to work, where a worker gets injured. He immediately applies a pad to the injury, despite the others referring to it as 'impure'. The doctor lauds Laxmi's quick thinking and says that it is the cleanest choice to stop bleeding. Excited, Laxmi buys some cotton, cloth, and glue and makes a temporary pad, which he thinks is a better replacement for the costly one. \n\nGayatri uses it but the pad fails in its function and she tells Laxmi to not interfere in women's matters again. Laxmi again tries to make a pad, and gives it to a female medical student, who decides to help him out but is deterred by her friends. To add to his woes, his meeting with the student makes his wife think that he has an affair. Laxmi tries to give his sister pads, which leads to embarrassment in front of her in-laws. Next, he tries it on himself by attaching a balloon filled with goat blood, which leads to him getting blood all over his trousers in public, resulting in humiliation. This act causes him to be branded 'a man with loose morals' by the entire village. Gayatri's brothers take her away and Laxmi decides to leave, pledging to fight the taboo surrounding menstruation.\n\nAfter learning that sanitary pads use the more absorbent cellulose fibre rather than cotton, Laxmi goes to a college to gain knowledge about the materials used in sanitary napkins. In need of money and shelter, he works as a manservant in a professor's house. The professor's son introduces him to the Internet and helps him get information. The professor is baffled by Laxmi's actions and shows him videos of pad-making machines worth millions to derail his ideas. It has the opposite effect: Laxmi is inspired by this to make his own pad-making machine. He borrows money and manages to make a good pad but has no one to test it. He ends up meeting Pari Walia ( Sonam Kapoor), a modern, educated woman from the city, and supplies a pad to her. When he asks for feedback, she says that it's like a normal pad. Laxmi's joy knows no bounds and he calls Gayatri to give her the news. Gayatri gets upset at his obsession with menstruation, and her brother warns him to stay away. \n\nPari sees Laxmi's potential and invites him to an innovation fair in Delhi. Laxmi's invention is recognized as the 'Life-Changing Innovation of the Year' and he shoots to fame but the villagers, on realizing the nature of his invention, insult him. Pari helps a dejected Laxmi sell his pads to rural women, who later join him in his venture. Laxmi and Pari travel from village to village, making low-cost pad-manufacturing machines, creating small pad-making factories, and providing rural women both jobs and pads for sale. He is invited to New York and gives a speech at UNICEF. Back home, he is awarded the Padmashri. Pari falls in love with him, which makes Laxmi conflicted as he has feelings for her too. However, she steps back for his happiness, with Laxmi telling her she helped make him a new man. Laxmi returns to a hero's welcome in his village. The film ends with Laxmi and Gayatri finally uniting, and Laxmi finding continued success with his endeavors.\n\n\nThe film is based on \"The Sanitary Man of Sacred Land\", a short story from Twinkle Khanna's book, \"The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad\", which is inspired from the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, a Tamil Nadu-based social activist who revolutionized the concept of menstrual hygiene in rural India by creating a low-cost sanitary napkin machine. \"Pad Man\" was envisioned to be an awareness film without focusing on commercial aspects. The producers' main agenda was to reach out to a wide audience to create awareness and eradicate prevalent superstitions in India surrounding sanitary pads. As with Kumar's previous film, \"\", he hoped to educate the masses, both women and men, about menstrual hygiene and to stop labelling it as stigma or taboo in society. Furthermore, it was a plea towards politicians to drive their attention towards sanitary pads and making it mandatory across institutions.\n\nThe idea to adapt Murugan's life began in 2015 when Twinkle Khanna came across his story while doing a research for a column in \"The Times of India\". Inspired and moved by his persistence and determination, she wrote about him in her book, \"The Legend of Lakshmi Prasad\" (2016). Later, she planned to adapt his life to the big screen in order to reach out to more audiences, saying \"our world is filled with viewers, not readers.\" Khanna, who also serves as a producer on the film, said she was drawn to the project due to its relevant yet underrated subject about menstruation and Muruganantham's determination.\n\nR. Balki was Khanna's first choice to direct the film. She had previously seen Balki's work and appreciated his sensitivity in filmmaking. \n\nIn November 2017, Sony Pictures became the global distributor for the film.\n\nAkshay Kumar plays Arunachalam Muruganantham, also known as \"India's Menstrual Man\". Kumar was not the first choice to play the role. Khanna thought of a few actors but she eventually handed it to Kumar after Muruganantham's insistence and because she thought it would be a game-changing event if Kumar, who the Indian public idolises and men look up to, wore a sanitary pad.\n\nPre-production began in March 2017, and principal photography commenced on March 14. Filming moved to Delhi in April. Muruganantham worked closely with Kumar and Khanna on set in India, making sure every detail was accurate from the way he built his machine, to how to operate it, even his own posture. \n\nMajority of the film was shot in a small town beside Narmada river named, Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh. After filming ended in India, the team travelled to New York City where pivotal scenes were filmmed in Brooklyn Bridge, Times Square and Jazz at Lincoln Center, as well as the United Nations headquarter. It is the second Bollywood film to be shot at the site following \"Half Girlfriend\" while Hollywood film \"The Interpreter\" was the first.\n\nThe film was initially planned to be released on 13 April 2018, but was later moved to 26 January. However, on 19 January, it was announced that the film has been postponed to 9 February 2018 to avoid clashing with Sanjay Leela Bhansali's \"Padmaavat\". Regarding the possible box office clash with \"Aiyaary\" which was to release on the same day, Kumar denounced the tension saying that it was unlikely since both films have different subjects and themes.\n\n\"Pad Man\" is scheduled to be released across 3350 screens worldwide; 2750 screens in India and 600 screens overseas. Being a social issue based film, the producer's are planning to show the film in various schools in smaller towns and cities with the aid of various ministries and the government.\n\nThe first trailer was released on 15 December 2017. Soon after, the trailer began trending on Twitter with the hashtag #PadManTrailer. Scenes showing Kumar casually trying to wear a sanitary napkin and handing them to his sister became a trending topic. A second poster was released on 25 December which shows Kumar holding cotton in his hand with words like \"Fighter, Genius, Innovation, Unreal Man, No Shame, Real Problem and Passion\" written all around. \"The Times of India\" called it a \"unique poster\".\n\nThe film was banned in Kuwait and Pakistan due to its subject revolving around a taboo. Central Board of Film Censors, Pakistan refused to give the No-Objection Certificate to the film and said, \"we cannot allow a film whose name, subject and story are not acceptable yet in our society.\" They disallowed the Pakistani film distributors IMGC and HKC to purchase the film rights and stated that they were \"ruining Islamic traditions, history and culture.\" Film posters were also removed from the local cinemas. Some Pakistani women have protested these decisions by sending pictures of them holding sanitary pads to the censor board.\n\n\"Pad Man\" earned a modest on its opening day in India. Buoyed by good word of mouth, the film witnessed gradual momemtum on its second and third day earning and respectively. In total, it earned nett (US$7.9 million gross) over its opening weekend. \n\nOutside India, the film debuted simultaneously with its domestic debut in 5 international markets which generated around an estimated US$1 million for a worldwide opening of US$8.9 million.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, \"Pad Man\" grossed US$760,000 at an average of US$5,000 per screen from 152 screens. Sony noted that the film debuted above the opening of Kumar's \"\", which debuted with US$678,000 from 176 theaters (US$3,852 per theater average).\n\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 92% based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.7/10. \"Hindustan Times\" rated the film 3/5 stars, writing that \"PadMan begins on [a] slow note and drags on for some time before picking up [the] pace. The characters in the supporting cast seem to be in a race for overacting\".\n\nThe music of the film was composed by Amit Trivedi while the lyrics were written by Kausar Munir. The first track, \"Aaj Se Teri\", which is sung by Arijit Singh, was released on 20 December 2017. The second track, \"The Pad Man Song\", sung by Mika Singh, was released on 25 December 2017. The music of the film was officially released by Zee Music Company on 26 December 2017.\n\n\n"}

Petters was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison for all counts related to running the Ponzi Scheme.\n\nIn early November 2010, the Hennepin County attorney's office filed drug possession charges against former Petters Group General Counsel David Baer, based on a safe full of illegal drugs under his office desk allegedly found by federal agents during the Sept. 24, 2008 raid. Baer subsequently received three years criminal probation for three felony drug convictions. He also received three years probation from the Minnesota Supreme Court pursuant to a complaint from the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility.\n"}

{"id": "30081680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30081680", "title": "Sarasota Chalk Festival", "text": "Sarasota Chalk Festival\n\nSarasota Chalk Festival is an American cultural event of public art that celebrates a performing art form of pavement art also known as Italian street painting. During the festival artists use chalk, and occasionally special paint, to paint the road surface to create large works of art while the viewer can watch the creative process. The festival is focused around the street artists who are known as Madonnari in Italy or commonly referred to \"Street Painters\", \"Chalk Artists\", \"Sidewalk Artists\", or \"Pavement Artists\". The festival is held annually in downtown Sarasota in Burns Square.\n\nOn October 28, 2013 the festival was featured by the New York Times as a destination recommended on its \"Guide to Intelligent Travel\".\n\nIn 2010 during its third season, the Sarasota Chalk Festival became the first \"international\" street painting festival in the United States of America, inviting artists from around the world to participate. Setting a unique theme for each year was instituted for the planning of each annual event with that year as well. Documenting the origins, diversity, spirit, appeal, and growing popularity of street painting, filming for a 2013 film on modern street painting around the world began with scenes and interviews at the first international Sarasota festival; a video production describing the film was released in February 2012.\n\nA book, Sarasota Chalk Festival \"(right)\", was published by the festival organization in time for availability at the 2011 festival. The 214-page book, described as a collector edition, provides an extensive history of the street painting it features and discusses many of the artists who have become famous for performing the art at various locations around the world. Many of these artists were invited to the debut of broadening the scope of the festival to international status. The book provides examples of their work—either here or abroad. Many of the artists return each year, so the material remains timely as well as historic. It also describes the music and arts on Sarasota's \"Cultural Coast\" and the many attractive Sarasota beaches on the Gulf of Mexico. The book has been available at each festival since its publication and always is available at the festival offices.\n\nThe theme of the 2010 festival was Halloween. Many renowned street painters from all over the world participated in the event that was held October 25 through October 31. More than 80,000 people attended the seven-day event, and in an unprecedented action prompted by the popularity of the festival, the municipal government extended the street closure for an additional day so people could view the completed artworks. Several documentaries were created about the 2010 festival that were released locally and in Europe, including the first documentary on Street Painting to be released at the Grazie di Curtatone 24-hour Madonnari Competition, August 15, 2012. Sarasota Chalk Festival founder Denise Kowal was invited to be a judge at the 2011 Grazie di Curtatone, making her the second foreigner and first American to be invited to judge this prestigious festival that was the first street painting festival in the world. The Grazie di Curtatone festival is celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2012 and Denise Kowal was invited again to be a judge of the competition.\nThe featured artist at the Sarasota festival, Maestro Madonnaro and Guinness World Record holder, Edgar Mueller, created a three-dimensional (3-D) street painting that made history for introducing a new perspective in street art that with special equipment may be seen in three-dimensions. This ground-breaking street painting also appeared to change from a giant by day, to a fetus by night, through the use of photoluminescent paints and artificial lighting. It measured 100' x 40'.\n\nA second guest artist and first Guinness World Record holder for a street painter, Tracy Lee Stum, also was featured in 2010. She created a two-point perspective 65' x 30' 3-D interactive Mousetrap game and completed the installation with assistance from Sharyn Namnath, Julio Jimenez, Charlene Lanzel, and Fred Wilms. A third Guinness World Record holder, Leon Keer, traveled from the Netherlands and won third place for his original street painting featuring depictions of Alice in Wonderland and Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nGenna Panzarella, the first woman to be awarded the Maestra Madonnaro title in Grazie di Curtatone, Italy, created a giant painting of a skeletal horse during the festival. and Maestro Madonnaro Vera Bugatti traveled from Italy to America for the first time in order to create her original street painting, incorporating a Batman theme.\n\nThe 2010 festival supported several secondary events held on its fringes. They included the \"Hallowscreen\" Fringe Film Festival with indoor and outdoor movies organized by executive director Lori Bowen, the France Engels Couture 60' Runway Show in cooperation with Carrianna Hutchinson, Sarasota's Largest Pumpkin Carving Contest, a performance stage with multiple artists such as flutist Jane Hoffman and guitarist Rick Peterson, the Moving Ethos Dance Company, the West Coast Civic Ballet, the Jump Dance Company, The Garbage-Men, and the Dragonfly Café Poets.\n\nIn 2011, with the theme 'Pavement Art Through the Ages', the Sarasota Chalk Festival attracted 250 renowned pavement artists from all over the world. Artists from France, Australia, Germany, Canada, Peru, Spain, Mexico, Netherlands, Japan, Italy, France, and Brazil as well as from almost every state in the United States traveled to participate in the week-long festival that drew 200,000 visitors.\n\nThree-dimensional\n\nA museum gallery displaying works by Kurt Wenner, the innovator of three-dimensional (3-D) pavement art, was held and Wenner presented six lectures and demonstrations as well as creating a street painting with students as an instructional lesson on perspective during the event. Wenner had started the first street painting festival in the United States more than 25 years previously.\n\nDutch artist Leon Keer returned to the festival and, along with other members of Planet Street Painting, executed a 3-D depiction of China's Terracotta Army in Lego. This piece attracted international media attention including videos on the work. It was painted in conjunction with the appearance of a 9-feet-tall Lego man, by artist Ego Leonard, that washed up on Siesta Key in Sarasota on October 25, 2011 with the words, \"No Real Than You Are\", emblazoned on his green T-shirt. The giant Lego man was \"arrested\" on charges of \"loitering\" by the Sarasota County sheriff, and many attempts were made to release Ego Leonard in time for him to attend the festival. Unfortunately, these attempts failed and he missed the entire festival. The sheriff stated that the sculpture must be kept for ninety days so that its owner had time to claim it. With no one coming forward as his owner, finally, he was released to Denise Kowal after the ninety-day period had elapsed. Ego Leonard stayed in Sarasota at historic Burns Square until July 2012, when he \"swam\" to Los Angeles, California where he was invited to show his artwork.\n\nAnother monumental 3-D installation created at the festival was a 30' x 60' opera set by the Baltimore artist, Michael Kirby. The piece was a mix of 3-D art painting and real props and it was created for a performance of \"Madame Butterfly\" by the Sarasota Opera. This undertaking was the first of its kind.\n\nAmong the many monumental 3-D installations at the festival others included, \na 30' x 60' piece entitled \"Avatar\" by German artist Gregor Wosik, \na 15' x 20' piece depicting mermaids by USA artist Melanie Stimmell, \na 15' x 15' piece entitled \"Four Continents\" by USA artist Julie Kirk-Purcell, \na 15' x 30' circus piece by Spanish artist Eduardo Relero, \na 15' x 20' piece entitled \"Books\" by Brazilian artist Eduardo Kobra, \na 30' x 40' piece entitled \"Augmented Realty\" by USA artists Art for After Hours,\na 12' x 24' piece entitled \"Pirate Ship\" by USA artists Wayne and Cheryl Renshaw, and \na 15' x 30' piece entitled \"Skatepark\" by USA artist Rod Tryon.\n\nCellograff\n\nThe 2011 festival introduced \"Cellograff\" to the United States. It is a form of graffiti executed on cellophane wrapped between poles. More than five of these temporary installations were created by iKanoGrafik.\n\nGoing Vertical\n\nThe 2011 Sarasota Chalk Festival also added \"Going Vertical\" as an additional feature of the festival and invited graffiti artists and muralists from around the world to participate. French artist MTO from Berlin, Kanos, Astros, and Katre from France, ChorBoggie and Max Ehrman from California, Eduardo Kobra from Brazil, A mural depicting a historic scene of the busy downtown in Sarasota at the turn of the twentieth century was created by Eduardo Kobra that covered the entire eastern side of a prominent building in Burns Square. It has become the background for photographs of the main events and primary drawings of each succeeding festival. Anat Ronan, Sunny Miller from Lafayette, Indiana, Dutch artist Remko Van Schaik, and many regional artists including Truman Adams completed works in different areas of the city. The artists were assigned to create murals on the walls of several buildings selected in the city, including both private and public properties, but visually accessible to the public. The pieces were created in cooperation with the artists, the city, and the property owners.\n\nFollowing the festival, on November 30, the architect and the city held a reception atop its dramatic new parking garage on Palm Avenue to celebrate the murals that had been painted on each of its five floors as part of \"Going Vertical\". Each floor has a unique mural celebrating the arts in Sarasota, representing dance, film, music, opera, and theatre. The garage murals were funded through a public art fund that is created with donations required of the developers of new buildings in the city who do not provide public art for their project.\n\nIn January 2012 the dates of that year's annual event were announced on the festival's web site as, October 28 through November 6, and the theme, \"Circus City, USA\", was declared. The theme of the festival was chosen to celebrate the 1920s in Sarasota, when the city became the winter home of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus.\n\nThroughout the year announcements of celebrity artists and performers who would be featured included Sarasota resident and tight rope walker Nik Wallenda, 3-D pavement art innovator Kurt Wenner, Ego Army artist Leon Keer, and Sword-swallower Johnny Fox. Performers from Circus Sarasota, Sailor Circus, Big Cat Habitat, and Fuzion Dance were scheduled to participate. The 2012 festival also would feature international acrobats and performers alongside the artworks and two life-size sculptures of Indian elephants, as well as two performance stages and a music stage.\n\nA publisher of several local newspapers created a free, forty-page guide to the ten-day festival \"(right)\" that provided a map of the 2012 festival, a timeline for its events, articles featuring most of the special events, documentation of donors and volunteers, as well as a history of the festival and the street art it presents. This free publication was made available in the Sarasota Observer, at many local stores and venues throughout the county, at the offices of the festival, and it was handed to attendees as they entered the festival gates as well as at refreshment and souvenir sales booths among the artworks on the street. The Observer is a newspaper that is distributed for free at newsstands, museums, libraries, government offices, stores, and sidewalk literature boxes in neighborhoods throughout the county.\n\nInternational coverage of the 2012 festival began with the start of the three-dimensional artwork and this news report, \"Chalk street art festival heads to Florida\", discusses the Kurt Wenner piece extensively. Numerous videos about the 2012 chalk festival, have been released in the United States and various native countries of the artists, as well as by fans and producers of similar festivals.\n\nEgo Leonard, who appeared on a Sarasota beach in 2011 and became ranked as the \"Number 2\" \"oddball story of the year 2011\" according to \"Time\", was featured at the festival. He missed last year during his protective custody \"incarceration\" by the Sarasota county sheriff.\n\nSnowflake and Surus, two life-sized sculptures of Indian elephants, were created to mark the entrances to the festival. They quickly became a favorite of the crowds. After the close of the festival, they were retained on the private property of the founder of the festival, at her historic building that was built by Owen Burns at the point defining the Burns Square section of town that hosts the festival each year. The elephant pair took on a life of their own, becoming a community favorite for photographs and regular visits. When removed for restoration before being integrated into the 2013 festival, they became a topic of concern, until reassurances that they would return were published.\n\nGoing Vertical also accompanied the festival in 2012 for a second season with Pixel Pancho, Entes y Pesimo, MTO, and many more national and international street artists participating. Many dramatic and colorful murals were created and under the leadership of its manager, Kafi Benz, the project expanded to include a mural in Manatee County. The final mural of the 2012 project, \"Go, Go, Denise, Go!\", was painted in December by MTO and featured an image of the chalk festival director as a boxer, presumably in response to the skirmishes in which she acted to defend the street artists when a few people criticized the cutting-edge-street-art nature of some of the artwork, and about which MTO produced a documentary movie, \"FL: unpremeditated movie\", that was released in March 2013.\n\nThe festival and the murals received accolades in the community and planning for the 2013 season began quickly in January with conferences with city officials about early approvals for essential logistical details for the event scheduled for mid-November.\n\nHonoring veterans for the 2013 Chalk Festival was suggested by its official photographer since 2011 and a veteran of the Vietnam War, David Taylor. Choosing the suggestion enabled the festival to receive a sponsorship by the Patterson Foundation, which donated extensive additions to the Sarasota National Cemetery and kicked off its celebrations leading up to the opening of the planned amphitheater. Partnering with the foundation resulted in the adoption of its theme, \"Legacy of Valor: honoring veterans, inspiring patriotism, and embracing freedom\" and planning on the adaptation to events scheduled for the festival began. The poster for 2013 \"(right)\" carries the festival theme to a universal level, emphasizing the \"heart\" felt by veterans, support personnel, and citizens alike in a legacy of valor.\n\nMore than 500 artists and thousands of people participated in the event embracing the theme as the festival began on November 13 and lasted six days through November 18.\n\nThe festival announced in July that it would expand significantly farther to the north for 2013, doubling its area, and the Sarasota Observer provided a map with a diagram of the new areas of Pineapple Avenue that would host portions of the event. The event extended across Main Street in the heart of downtown, past Five Points Park, to First Street. The southerly boundary of the festival remained in Burns Square where South Pineapple Avenue converges with South Orange Avenue.\n\nSculpture was featured at the festival again, but in a grander scale. A minimalist sculpture garden based on the Sarasota National Cemetery was featured prominently at one section of the festival, taking up an entire block that to emphasize the solemnity of the sacrifice fallen veterans made for their country. The garden consisted of headstones and memorial features. Participation by festival goers was planned to honor veterans known or related to them as well as to all working to defend the country throughout its existence, including Rosie the Riveter! Ceremonies in the garden were held throughout each day, ending with \"Taps\" at dusk.\n\nIn August the festival responded to the extensive concern in the community about the two elephant sculptures being removed from Burns Square by explaining that they would return and be integrated into the 2013 festival.\n\nIn September the festival organization made an announcement that a curated exhibition of studio artworks by major artists participating in the chalk festival and \"Going Vertical\", \"Reimagining the Sarasota Chalk Festival Artists\", was planned. Although recognized as street artists, their studio works also hang in museums around the world. Some of these studio works were featured and available for sale during the chalk festival as the premier exhibit on tenth street of the Ice House. The VIP premier opening event was November 12, 2013 and the closing event of the festival November 17, 2013. Shortly after the close of the exhibit, many of these paintings became featured at the Sarasota Chalk Festival gift shop and gallery, opened at 529 South Pineapple Avenue. The shop is connected to the festival office at 530 South Orange Avenue via a passage through the historic building and it will remain open throughout the year.\n\nDuring the first week of November the Sarasota Observer published a complete guide to the 2013 festival and distributed it within its weekly paper edition. This was the second year the free publication issued a guide to the festival. It featured a map of the festival events and their locations as well as articles on many aspects of the festival. Distribution at the festival and to many outlets in the city made the guide available to visitors.\n\nThe November 22, 2013 Sarasota News Leader published a nine-page spread of images from the festival and the publication also featured one of the drawings, portraying John F. Kennedy, on its cover.\n\nGoing Vertical projects and associated chalk festival events occurred throughout the year. The first mural painted for the 2013 festival season, however, appeared during the end of October on the long, western wall of the Ice House. The mural was painted by JBAK, which is the team of James Bullough and Addison Karl. They are known internationally for combining the vastly different styles into one painting. The final mural of the season, \"Road Trip 2\" by MTO, was painted on the northern wall of The Players Theatre. It was completed on November 27.\n\nThe 2014 festival moved to Venice, Florida after six seasons in Sarasota, Florida, USA. The founder, Denise Kowal, organized artists from around the world to create a Guinness World Record for the Largest Anamorphic (3d) Pavement Art in the world. Kurt Wenner, the innovator of the 3d pavement art form created the design composed of 11 square sectors, each sector was 42 feet on a side and composed of 14 tiles- three feet square each. This makes a total footage of 19,404 square feet. Wenner wrote Kowal, \"As I was composing the work I became very aware of the implications of the size. It is really an almost impossible task. A single extra row of plain (unbroken) tiles painted around the work would put this size over 22,000 square feet.\" The artists led by Julie Kirk-Purcell, one of the first female pioneers of the art form, finished the piece in 11 days with one rain day. Artists even added fossils in the rocks and signed their names to make the 1/4 mile walk around the painting interesting to viewers. The final measurements was measured at 22,747.6 square feet by Strayer Survey & Mapping in accordance with the National Surveying Standards meeting the accuracy standards required for the record.\n\nIn February 2015 Guinness World Records, the global authority on record-breaking achievements, announced that the Sarasota Chalk Festival, a 501c3 nonprofit cultural arts organization, secured the title for the 'Largest Anamorphic Pavement Art' in the world during the November 2014 Chalk Festival in Venice, Florida, U.S.A. Anamorphic (3D) pavement art that involves tricking the brain into seeing something rise above or sink below a flat surface was invented by KURT WENNER in 1982 by combining traditional street painting with his classical training and understanding of illusion.\n\nArtists traveled from all over the world to participate, including past record holders, Remko van Schaik from the Netherlands, Marion Ruthardt, Gregor Wosik and Lydia Hitzfeld from Germany. Other notable pavement artists included Matthew May from the Netherlands, Roberto Carlos Treviño Rodriguez, Carlosalberto Gh, Adry del Rocío and Ruben Arriaga from Mexico, Frederike Fredda Wouters from Germany, Tomoteru ToMo Saito from Japan, Alex Maksiov from Ukraine, JM Navello from France, Vera Bugatti, Ketty Grossi, Luigi Legno, Tony Cuboliquido and FabioFedele ItalianStreetpainting from Italy, Philippenzo Madonnaro, Darya Sharova and Victorio Puzzini from Russia, Sergio Nino from Columbia, Sharyn Chan Namnath, Genna Panzarella, Lori A. Escalera, Lorelle Miller from California, Cathy Gallatin and Mera Oliveria from Oregon, Anat Ronen from Texas, Kitty K Dyble Thompson from Wisconsin, Craig Thomas from Missouri, David Brancato, Jane Durandj, Ilona Fries, Julie Graden, Jamie Sealander, Janet Tombros, Michele Rayner-Altenbernd and Michele Michelle Clinton from Florida. The attempt was made possible because of hundreds of people that included the support of all the artists, volunteers, visitors and major sponsors such as the City of Venice, Fairfield Inn & Suites of Venice, Sharky's On The Pier, Suncoast Air Center, Safway Scaffolding, Sherwin Williams Paint, Pro Paint, Venice Fire Department, LandShark Lager, Venice Gondolier Sun, Clothesline Tees and Kenyon Kowal.\n\n"}
{"id": "3168065", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3168065", "title": "Sexual victimization of Native American women", "text": "Sexual victimization of Native American women\n\nIn the United States, Native American women are more than twice as likely as White women, Asian women, and Black women to experience sexual violence. \nThe FBI investigates the crime and the office of the United States Attorney decides whether to prosecute In order to protect victims on reservations.\n\nRecognizing sovereignty and affording Native tribes the right to prosecute non-Natives who commit crimes against Native Americans on reservations has been called an extremely important first step in a series of legal changes that would affect how these violations are responded to and viewed at the community, state, and federal level.\n\nAmnesty International published \"Maze of Injustice: the failure to protect indigenous women from sexual violence in the USA\", \nin order to represent the voices of survivors of sexual violence. The research was done for the report in 2005 and 2006 in three different locations with different policing and juridical arrangements. Those locations include Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North and South Dakota, state of Oklahoma, and the state of Alaska. Amnesty International interviewed victims of sexual assault, tribal, state, and federal law enforcement officials, prosecutors and tribal judges for the report. While finding officials to interview for the report, the Executive Office of US Attorneys told them individual US attorneys cannot participate in the survey.\n\nThe report opens with the story of a young Alaskan Native woman raped by a non-native man. In July 2006, the woman was raped and rushed to the ER where she was treated as a drunk. They later sent her to a non-native shelter for women where she was also treated as a drunk because of her trauma (Maze of Injustice, 1). Most Native women don't report their assaults because of the fear nothing will be done. Another story that the article reported was the story of a 21-year Native women who was raped by four men in later died in 2003. The case was closed because of questioning of jurisdictions (Maze of Injustice, 6). Each women that shared her story in the report had a common element in their stories. The injustice these women faced were mainly based on stereotypes. Rather their trials took place on a Federal or State level the women were viewed as drunks and some blame was put on them.\n\nWhen pursuing justice women go through a maze between tribal, state and federal law. The women are first asked \"was it in our jurisdiction and was the perpetrator Native American?\" when they first contact the police department. It takes a lot of time just to have your case heard so women give up (Maze of Injustice 8). \"The Amnesty International\" report go on to list reasons why they believe these injustices are occurring. The first reason for injustice described is the lack of training and delay or failure to respond of police officers (Maze of Injustice, 41). If the police officers are not the first to respond the women lose confidence in pursuing a case against the perpetrators. The next reasons for injustice presented are issues within each level of the US's legal system. The lack of justice for Native women's sexual abuse within the tribal level is the lack of funding from the government. Also, the federal government limits the number of prison sentences tribal courts can make. The federal government also prohibits tribal courts to prosecute Non-Native suspects because of the 1978 Oliphant v. Suquamish case. On a federal level the issue of discrimination and limitations on prosecution of sexual assault is a reason for injustice. Things are a little more complicated on a States level. The distance of courts, language barriers, lack of funding for prosecution, and cultural competency are main causes of injustice for Native victims on a State level (Maze of Injustice 63-67).\n\n\"The Amnesty International\" gives their audiences suggestions as to how to stop violence against Indigenous women. Some of their recommendations include: \"Federal and state governments should take effective measures, in consultation and co-operation with Native American and Alaska Native peoples, to combat prejudice and eliminate stereotyping of and discrimination against Indigenous peoples. The federal government should take steps – including by providing sufficient funding – to ensure the full implementation of the 2005 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, particularly Title IX (Tribal Programs). Law enforcement agencies should recognize in policy and practice that all police officers have the authority to take action in response to reports of sexual violence, including rape, within their jurisdiction and to apprehend the alleged perpetrators in order to transfer them to the appropriate authorities for investigation and prosecution. In particular, where sexual violence is committed in Indian Country and in Alaska Native villages, tribal law enforcement officials must be recognized as having the authority to apprehend both Native and non-Native suspects. Federal authorities should ensure that tribal police forces have access to federal funding to enable them to recruit, train, equip and retain sufficient law enforcement officers to provide adequate law enforcement coverage which is responsive to the needs of the Indigenous peoples they serve.\" ( Maze of Injustice 84-87).\n\n\n"}

{"id": "65344", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65344", "title": "Sudden infant death syndrome", "text": "Sudden infant death syndrome\n\nSudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remains unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep. Typically death occurs between the hours of 00:00 and 09:00. There is usually no evidence of struggle and no noise produced.\nThe exact cause of SIDS is unknown. The requirement of a combination of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility, a specific time in development, and an environmental stressor has been proposed. These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accidental suffocation from bed sharing (also known as co-sleeping) or soft objects may also play a role. Another risk factor is being born before 39 weeks of gestation. SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs). Other causes include infections, genetic disorders, and heart problems. While child abuse in the form of intentional suffocation may be misdiagnosed as SIDS, this is believed to make up less than 5% of cases.\nThe most effective method of reducing the risk of SIDS is putting a child less than one year old on their back to sleep. Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a pacifier, and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Breastfeeding and immunization may also be preventive. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is sudden, without witnesses, and often associated with an investigation.\nRates of SIDS vary nearly tenfold in developed countries from one in a thousand to one in ten thousand. Globally it resulted in about 19,200 deaths in 2015 down from 22,000 deaths in 1990. SIDS was the third leading cause of death in children less than one year old in the United States in 2011. It is the most common cause of death between one month and one year of age. About 90% of cases happen before six months of age, with it being most frequent between two months and four months of age. It is more common in boys than girls.\n\nSIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be applied to only those cases in which an infant's death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation, including:\n\nAfter investigation, some of these infant deaths are found to be caused by accidental suffocation, hyperthermia or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are shifting to the term \"sudden unexpected death in infancy\" (SUDI) for professional, scientific, and coronial clarity.\nThe term SUDI is now often used instead of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) because some coroners prefer to use the term 'undetermined' for a death previously considered to be SIDS. This change is causing diagnostic shift in the mortality data. In addition, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently proposed that such deaths be called \"sudden unexpected infant deaths\" (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.\n\nSIDS has a 4-parameter lognormal age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth — the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death.\n\nBy definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year, with the peak incidence occurring when the infant is at 2 to 4 months of age. This is considered a critical period because the infant's ability to rouse from sleep is not yet mature.\n\nThe cause of SIDS is unknown. Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their stomachs, there has been little understanding of the syndrome's biological process or its potential causes. The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by social, economic, and cultural factors, such as maternal education, race or ethnicity, and poverty. SIDS is believed to occur when an infant with an underlying biological vulnerability, who is at a critical development age, is exposed to an external trigger. The following risk factors generally contribute either to the underlying biological vulnerability or represent an external trigger:\n\nSIDS rates are higher for infants of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. SIDS correlates with levels of nicotine and derivatives in the infant. Nicotine and derivatives cause significant alterations in fetal neurodevelopment.\n\nPlacing an infant to sleep while lying on the stomach or the side increases the risk. This increased risk is greatest at two to three months of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one year of age as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.\n\nSharing a bed with parents or siblings increases the risk for SIDS. This risk is greatest in the first three months of life, when the mattress is soft, when one or more persons share the infant's bed, especially when the bed partners are using drugs or alcohol or are smoking. The risk remains, however, even in parents who do not smoke or use drugs. The American Academy of Pediatrics thus recommends \"room-sharing without bed-sharing\", stating that such an arrangement can decrease the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. Furthermore, the Academy recommended against devices marketed to make bed-sharing \"safe\", such as in-bed co-sleepers.\n\nBreastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS. It is not clear if co-sleeping among mothers who breastfeed without any other risk factors increases SIDS risk.\n\nSIDS rates decrease with increasing maternal age, with teenage mothers at greatest risk. Delayed or inadequate prenatal care also increases risk. Low birth weight is a significant risk factor. In the United States from 1995 to 1998, the SIDS death rate for infants weighing 1000–1499 g was 2.89/1000, while for a birth weight of 3500–3999 g, it was only 0.51/1000. Premature birth increases the risk of SIDS death roughly fourfold. From 1995 to 1998, the U.S. SIDS rate for births at 37–39 weeks of gestation was 0.73/1000, while the SIDS rate for births at 28–31 weeks of gestation was 2.39/1000.\n\nAnemia has also been linked to SIDS (note, however, that per item 6 in the list of epidemiologic characteristics below, extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant's total hemoglobin can only be measured during life.). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant's first year.\n\nGenetics plays a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males. There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female, for a male fraction of 0.61. This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, infant race is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often it is chosen by the mother. The X-linkage hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess could be related to a dominant X-linked allele, occurring with a frequency of that is protective of transient cerebral anoxia. An unprotected male would occur with a frequency of and an unprotected female would occur with a frequency of .\n\nAbout 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are believed to be due to channelopathies, which are inherited defects in the ion channels which play an important role in the contraction of the heart.\n\nDrinking of alcohol by parents is linked to SIDS. One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends. Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than twofold risk.\n\nThere is a tentative link with \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and \"Escherichia coli\". Vaccinations do not increase the risk of SIDS; contrarily, they are linked to a 50% lower risk of SIDS.\n\nSIDS has been linked to cold weather with this association believed to be due to over bundling and thus overheating.\n\nA 1998 report found that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in PVC and other cot mattress materials are not a cause of SIDS. The report also states that toxic gas cannot be generated from antimony in mattresses and that babies suffered SIDS on mattresses that did not contain the compound.\n\nA set of risk factors SIS has been identified with: increasing SIDS rate with live birth order; low increased risk of SIDS in subsequent siblings of SIDS; apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) are not a risk factor for subsequent SIDS; SIDS risk is greatest during sleep.\n\nSome conditions that are often undiagnosed and could be confused with or comorbid with SIDS include:\n\nFor example, an infant with MCAD deficiency could have died by \"classical SIDS\" if found swaddled and prone with head covered in an overheated room where parents were smoking. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant may have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for the pathologist to distinguish between them.\n\nA 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in North Carolina that listed SIDS as the cause of death, and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation. The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such as unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.\n\nSeveral instances of infanticide have been uncovered where the diagnosis was originally SIDS. Estimate of the percentage of SIDS deaths that are actually infanticide vary from less than 1% to up to 5% of cases.\n\nSome have underestimated the risk of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family and the Royal Statistical Society issued a media release refuting this expert testimony in one UK case in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.\n\nA number of measures have been found to be effective in preventing SIDS including changing the sleeping position, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors has not been found to be useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their stomachs or side while sleeping.\n\nSleeping on the back has been found to reduce the risk of SIDS. It is thus recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and promoted as a best practice by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign. The incidence of SIDS has fallen in a number of countries in which this recommendation has been widely adopted. Sleeping on the back does not appear to increase the risk of choking even in those with gastroesophageal reflux disease. While infants in this position may sleep more lightly this is not harmful. Sharing the same room as one's parents but in a different bed may decrease the risk by half.\n\nThe use of pacifiers appears to decrease the risk of SIDS although the reason is unclear. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers pacifier use to prevent SIDS to be reasonable. Pacifiers do not appear to affect breastfeeding in the first four months, even though this is a common misconception.\n\nProduct safety experts advise against using pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, bumper pads (crib bumpers), stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib \"naked.\"\n\nBlankets or other clothing should not be placed over a baby's head.\n\nIn colder environments where bedding is required to maintain a baby's body temperature, the use of a \"baby sleep bag\" or \"sleep sack\" is becoming more popular. This is a soft bag with holes for the baby's arms and head. A zipper allows the bag to be closed around the baby. A study published in the \"European Journal of Pediatrics\" in August 1998 has shown the protective effects of a sleep sack as reducing the incidence of turning from back to front during sleep, reinforcing putting a baby to sleep on its back for placement into the sleep sack and preventing bedding from coming up over the face which leads to increased temperature and carbon dioxide rebreathing. They conclude in their study, \"The use of a sleeping-sack should be particularly promoted for infants with a low birth weight.\" The American Academy of Pediatrics also recommends them as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.\n\nA large investigation into diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccination and potential SIDS association by Berlin School of Public Health, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin concluded: \"Increased DTP immunisation coverage is associated with decreased SIDS mortality. Current recommendations on timely DTP immunisation should be emphasised to prevent not only specific infectious diseases but also potentially SIDS.\"\n\nMany other studies have also reached conclusions that vaccinations reduce the risk of SIDS. Studies generally show that SIDS risk is approximately halved by vaccinations.\n\nFamilies who are impacted by SIDS should be offered emotional support and grief counseling. The experience and manifestation of grief at the loss of an infant are impacted by cultural and individual differences.\n\nGlobally SIDS resulted in about 22,000 deaths , down from 30,000 deaths in 1990. Rates vary significantly by population from 0.05 per 1000 in Hong Kong to 6.7 per 1000 in American Indians.\n\nSIDS was responsible for 0.54 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.\n\nSIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004. But, during a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS being listed as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%. According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS \"A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn't decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting\".\n\nIn 2013, there are persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. In 2009, the rates of death range from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asian/Pacific Islander to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for American Indians/Alaska Native. African American infants have a 24% greater risk of having a SIDS related death and experience a 2.5 greater incidence of SIDS than in Caucasian infants. Rates are per 100,000 live births and enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population size.\n\nResearch suggests that factors which contribute more directly to SIDS risk—maternal age, exposure to smoking, safe sleep practices, etc.—vary by racial and ethnic group and therefore risk exposure also varies by these groups. Risk factors associated with prone sleeping patterns of African American families include mother's age, household poverty index, rural/urban status of residence, and infant's age. More than 50% of African American infants were placed in non-recommended sleeping positions according to a study completed in South Carolina. Cultural factors can be protective as well as problematic.\n\nThe rate per 1000 births varies in different ethnic groups in the United States:\n\nMuch of the media portrayal of infants shows them in non-recommended sleeping positions.\n\n\n\n"}

For example, \"put the turkey in the oven and the baby in the bed\" is wrongly heard as \"put the baby in the oven and the turkey in the bed\". Other variants set out that the doer of the deed was drug or alcohol-induced or an insane individual. In the end, the roasted baby is sometimes served as food to be consumed by the parents.\n\nThe person who roasts the baby is usually a babysitter or the baby's sibling.\n\nIn real life, there have been documented occurrences of babies being roasted, though by family members instead of strange babysitters. When Virginian Elizabeth Renee Otte roasted her baby in 1999, the incident was cited as causing the legend to become true. In November 2006, a second case of real-life baby-roasting was reported.\n\nIn February 2012, Ka Yang of California was charged with roasting her seven-week-old baby to death in a microwave. In her defence, she claimed she was having a \"seizure fit\" when it happened. In May 2012, a British citizen was arrested by Thai police after being found in possession of six corpses of roasted infants, some wrapped in gold leaf, reportedly in conformity with a \"black magic ritual\". In Siberia in January 2013, a roasted, dismembered baby was found by its mother, the alleged perpetrator being the infant's intoxicated uncle.\n\nOn November 16, 2015, a one-year old baby, J'Zyra Thompson, died after her three-year-old sibling put her in the oven and cooked her alive. Their mother, Racqual Thompson, left her four kids at home, which included a five-year-old and a two-year-old, when she went to pick up a pizza. When they returned home, Thompson found J'Zyra's body cooked in the oven. Thompson and her boyfriend of ten months, 21-year-old Cornell Malone, were charged with endangering a child and are awaiting trial.\n\nIn March 2016, a 35-year-old mother in Texas showed up naked at her neighbor's door with her partially burned and naked 2-year-old daughter. When police arrived, she confessed that she had put the girl in the oven along with a cat she had recently shot dead, while making sexual advances toward an officer and singing praise to God. According to an affidavit from the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services, she seemed unconcerned with her daughter while in hospital and jail, where she was charged with injury to a child with serious bodily injury and tested positive for alcohol, marijuana and methamphetamine. The girl was put in foster care.\n\nIn the 1979 blaxploitation film \"Avenging Disco Godfather\", a PCP addict claims to have honey-roasted her baby for her family's Easter dinner, ostensibly so the baby's crying wouldn't spoil the occasion.\n\nIn August 2009, a joke advertisement showcasing a \"body part roaster\" \"specially designed to roast infants and other human morsels\" surfaced on the website of retailer Sears.com.\n\nThe song 'Babysitter on Acid' by the all-female punk rock band, Lunachicks is a retelling of the Urban Legend. The teenage babysitter, under the influence of drugs, roasts the baby in the oven and tells the mother over the phone that \"Wanna know how the baby is? / Don't worry, she's almost done\". The song was released on their 1990 album \"Babysitters On Acid\".\n\n"}
{"id": "81837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=81837", "title": "The Crystal Palace", "text": "The Crystal Palace\n\nThe Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass structure originally built in Hyde Park, London, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in its exhibition space to display examples of technology developed in the Industrial Revolution. Designed by Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was long, with an interior height of . It was three times larger than the size of St Paul's Cathedral. The introduction of the sheet glass method into Britain by Chance Brothers in 1832 made possible the production of large sheets of cheap but strong glass, and its use in the Crystal Palace created a structure with the greatest area of glass ever seen in a building and astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights.\n\nIt has been suggested that the name of the building resulted from a piece penned by the playwright Douglas Jerrold, who in July 1850 wrote in the satirical magazine \"Punch\" about the forthcoming Great Exhibition, referring to a \"palace of very crystal\".\n\nAfter the exhibition, it was decided to relocate the Palace to an area of South London known as Penge Common. It was rebuilt at the top of Penge Peak next to Sydenham Hill, an affluent suburb of large villas. It stood there for 82 years from 1854 until its destruction by fire in November 1936. The nearby residential area was renamed Crystal Palace after the landmark including the park that surrounds the site, home of the Crystal Palace National Sports Centre, which had previously been a football stadium that hosted the FA Cup Final between 1895 and 1914. Crystal Palace F.C. were founded at the site in 1905 and played at the Cup Final venue in their early years. The park still contains Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins's Crystal Palace Dinosaurs which date back to 1854.\n\nThe huge, modular, wood, glass and iron structure was originally erected in Hyde Park in London to house the Great Exhibition of 1851, which showcased the products of many countries throughout the world.\n\nThe Commission in charge of mounting the Great Exhibition was established in January 1850, and it was decided at the outset that the entire project would be funded by public subscription. An executive Building Committee was quickly formed to oversee the design and construction of the exhibition building, comprising Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Robert Stephenson, renowned architects Charles Barry and Thomas Leverton Donaldson, the Duke of Buccleuch and the Earl of Ellesmere, and chaired by William Cubitt. By 15 March 1850 they were ready to invite submissions, which had to conform to several key specifications: the building had to be temporary, simple, as cheap as possible, and economical to build within the short time remaining before the Exhibition opening, which had already been scheduled for 1 May 1851.\n\nWithin three weeks, the committee had received some 245 entries, including 38 international submissions from Australia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Hanover, Switzerland, Brunswick, Hamburg and France. Two designs, both in iron and glass, were singled out for praise—one by Richard Turner, co-designer of the Palm House at Kew, and the other by French architect Hector Horeau but despite the great number of submissions, the Committee rejected them all. Turner was furious at the rejection, and reportedly badgered the commissioners for months afterwards, seeking compensation, but at an estimated £300,000, his design (like Horeau's) was too expensive. As a last resort the committee came up with a standby design of its own, for a brick building in the \"rundbogenstil\" by Donaldson, featuring a sheet-iron dome designed by Brunel but it was widely criticized and ridiculed when it was published in the newspapers. Adding to the Committee's woes, the site for the Exhibition was still not confirmed; the preferred site was in Hyde Park, adjacent to Princes Gate near Kensington Rd, but other sites considered included Wormwood Scrubs, Battersea Park, the Isle of Dogs, Victoria Park and Regent's Park. Opponents of the scheme lobbied strenuously against the use of Hyde Park (and they were strongly supported by \"The Times\"). The most outspoken critic was arch-conservative Col. Charles de Laet Waldo Sibthorp; he denounced the Exhibition as \"one of the greatest humbugs, frauds and absurdities ever known\", and his trenchant opposition to both the Exhibition and its building continued even after it had closed.\nAt this point renowned gardener Joseph Paxton became interested in the project, and with the enthusiastic backing of Commission member Henry Cole, he decided to submit his own design. At this time, Paxton was chiefly known for his celebrated career as the head gardener for the 6th Duke of Devonshire at Chatsworth House, and by 1850 he had become a preeminent figure in British horticulture and had also earned great renown as a freelance garden designer; his works included the pioneering public gardens at Birkenhead Park which directly influenced the design of New York's Central Park. At Chatsworth, Paxton had experimented extensively with glasshouse construction, developing many novel techniques for modular construction, using combinations of standard-sized sheets of glass, laminated wood, and prefabricated cast iron. The \"Great Stove\" (or conservatory) at Chatsworth (built in 1836) was the first major application of Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof design, and was at the time the largest glass building in the world, covering around 28,000 square feet (2600 sq.m.).\n\nA decade later, taking advantage of the availability of the new cast plate glass, Paxton further developed his techniques with the Chatsworth Lily House, which featured a flat-roof version of the ridge-and-furrow glazing, and a curtain wall system that allowed the hanging of vertical bays of glass from cantilevered beams. The Lily House was built specifically to house the giant \"Victoria amazonica\" waterlily which had only recently been discovered by European botanists; the first specimen to reach England was originally kept at Kew Gardens, but it did not do well. Paxton's reputation as a gardener was so high by that time that he was invited to take the lily to Chatsworth; it thrived under his care and in 1849 he caused a sensation in the horticultural world when he succeeded in producing the first \"amazonica\" flowers to be grown in England (his daughter Alice was drawn for the newspapers, standing on one of leaves). The lily and its house led directly to Paxton's design for the Crystal Palace and he later cited the huge ribbed floating leaves as a key inspiration.\n\nPaxton left his meeting with Henry Cole on 9 June 1850 fired with enthusiasm. He immediately went to Hyde Park, where he 'walked' the site earmarked for the Exhibition. Two days later, on 11 June, while attending a board meeting of the Midland Railway, Paxton made his original concept drawing, which he doodled onto a sheet of pink blotting paper. This rough sketch (now in the Victoria & Albert Museum) incorporated all the basic features of the finished building, and it is a mark of Paxton's ingenuity and industriousness that detailed plans, calculations and costings were ready to submit in less than two weeks .\n\nThe project was a major gamble for Paxton, but circumstances were in his favour: he enjoyed a stellar reputation as a garden designer and builder, he was confident that his design was perfectly suited to the brief, and the Commission was now under enormous pressure to choose a design and get it built, the Exhibition opening now being less than a year away. In the event, Paxton's design fulfilled and surpassed all the requirements, and it proved to be vastly faster and cheaper to build than any other form of building of a comparable size. Indeed, his submission was budgeted at a remarkably low £85,800; by comparison, this was about 2-1/2 times more than the Great Stove at Chatsworth but it was only 28% of the estimated cost of Turner's design, and it promised a building which, with a footprint of over 770,000 sq.ft. (19 acres, or 7 hectares), would cover roughly twenty-five times the ground area of its progenitor.\n\nImpressed by the low bid for the construction contract submitted by the engineering firm Fox, Henderson and Co, the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building in time for the Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted transept across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled—thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major sticking point for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.\n\nPaxton's modular, hierarchical design reflected his practical brilliance as a designer and problem-solver. It incorporated many breakthroughs, offered practical advantages that no conventional building could match and, above all, embodied the spirit of British innovation and industrial might that the Great Exhibition was intended to celebrate.\n\nThe geometry of the Crystal Palace was a classic example of the concept of form following manufacturer's limitations: the shape and size of the whole building was directly based around the size of the panes of glass made by the supplier, Chance Brothers of Smethwick. These were the largest available at the time, measuring 10 inches wide by 49 inches long. Because the entire building was scaled around those dimensions, it meant that nearly the whole outer surface could be glazed using millions of identical panes, thereby drastically reducing both their production cost and the time needed to install them.\n\nThe original Hyde Park building was essentially a vast, flat-roofed rectangular hall. A huge open gallery ran along the main axis, with wings extending down either side. The main exhibition space was two stories high, with the upper floor stepped in from the boundary. Most of the building had a flat-profile roof, except for the central transept, which was covered by a 72 foot wide barrel-vaulted roof that stood 168\nfeet high at the top of the arch. Both the flat-profile sections and the arched transept roof were constructed using the key element of Paxton's design: his patented ridge-and-furrow roofing system, which had first seen use at Chatsworth. The basic roofing unit, in essence, took the form of a long triangular prism, which made it both extremely light and very strong, and meant it could be built with the minimum amount of materials.\n\nPaxton set the dimensions of this prism by using the length of single pane of glass (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical faces at either end of the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that did not need to be trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.\n\nBy multiplying these modules into a grid, the structure could be extended virtually infinitely. In its original form, the ground level of the Crystal Palace (in plan) measured 1848' x 456', which equates to a grid 77 modules long by 19 modules wide. Because each module was self-supporting, Paxton was able to leave out modules in some areas, creating larger square or rectangular spaces within the building to accommodate larger exhibits. On the lower level these larger spaces were covered by the floor above, and on the upper level by longer spans of roofing, but the dimensions of these larger spaces were always multiples of the basic 24' x 24' grid unit. The modules were also strong enough to be stacked vertically, enabling Paxton to add an upper floor that nearly doubled the amount of available exhibition space. Paxton also used longer trellis girders to create a clear span for the roof of the immense central gallery, which was 72 feet wide and 1800 feet long.\n\nPaxton's roofing system incorporated his elegant solution to the problem of draining the building's vast roof area. Like the Chatsworth Lily House (but unlike its later incarnation at Sydenham) most of the roof of the original Hyde Park structure had a horizontal profile, so heavy rain posed a potentially serious safety hazard. Because normal cast glass is brittle and has low tensile strength, there was a risk that the weight of any excess water build-up on the roof might have caused panes to shatter, showering shards of glass onto the patrons, ruining the valuable exhibits beneath, and weakening the structure. However, Paxton's ridge-and-furrow roof was designed to shed water very efficiently. Rain ran off the angled glass roof panes into U-shaped cast-iron channels which ran the length of each roof section at the bottom of the 'furrow'. These channels were ingeniously multifunctional. During construction, they served as the rails that supported and guided the trolleys on which the glaziers sat as they installed the roofing. Once completed, the channels acted both as the joists that supported the roof sections, and as guttering—a patented design now widely known as a \"Paxton gutter\". These gutters conducted the rainwater to the ends of each furrow, where they emptied into the larger main gutters, which were set at right angles to the smaller gutters, along the top of the main horizontal roof bearers. These main gutters drained at either end into the cast iron pillars, which also had an ingenious dual function: each was cast with a hollow core, allowing it to double as a concealed down-pipe that carried the storm-water down into the drains beneath the building.\n\nOne of the few issues Paxton could not completely solve was leaks—when completed, rain was found to be leaking into the huge building in over a thousand places. The leaks were sealed with putty, but the relatively poor quality of the sealant materials available at the time meant that the problem was never totally overcome.\n\nTo maintain a comfortable temperature inside such a large glass building was another major challenge, because the Great Exhibition took place decades before the introduction of mains electricity and air-conditioning. Glasshouses rely on the fact that they accumulate and retain heat from the sun, but such heat buildup would have been a major problem for the Exhibition, and this would have been exacerbated by the heat produced by the thousands of people who would be in the building at any given time. Paxton solved this with two clever strategies. One was to install external canvas shade-cloths that were stretched across the roof ridges. These served multiple functions: they reduced heat transmission, moderated and softened the light coming into the building, and acted as a primitive evaporative cooling system when water was sprayed onto them. The other part of the solution was Paxton's ingenious ventilation system. Each of the modules that formed the outer walls of the building was fitted with a prefabricated set of louvres that could be opened and closed using a gear mechanism, allowing hot stale air to escape. The flooring consisted of boards 22 cm (9 inches) wide, which were spaced about 1 cm apart; together with the louvres, this formed an effective passive air-conditioning system. Due to the pressure differential, the hot air escaping from the louvres generated a constant airflow that drew cooler air up through the gaps in the floor. The floor too had a dual function: the gaps between the boards acted as a grating that allowed dust and small pieces of refuse to fall or be swept through them onto the ground beneath, where it was collected daily by a team of cleaning boys. Paxton also designed machines to sweep the floors at the end of each day, but in practice, it was found that the trailing skirts of the female visitors did the job perfectly.\n\nThanks to the considerable economies of scale Paxton was able to exploit, the manufacture and assembly of the building parts was exceedingly quick and cheap. Each module was identical, fully prefabricated, self-supporting, and fast and easy to erect. All of the parts could be mass-produced in large numbers, and many parts served multiple functions, further reducing both the number of parts needed and their overall cost. Because of its comparatively low weight, the Crystal Palace required absolutely no heavy masonry for supporting walls or foundations, and the relatively light concrete footings on which it stood could be left in the ground once the building was removed (they remain in place today just beneath the surface of the site). The modules could be erected as quickly as the parts could reach the site—indeed, some sections were standing within eighteen hours of leaving the factory—and since each unit was self-supporting, workers were able to assemble much of the building section-by-section, without having to wait for other parts to be finished.\n\nFox, Henderson took possession of the site in July 1850 and erected wooden hoardings which were constructed using the timber that later became the floorboards of the finished building. More than 5000 navvies worked on the building during its construction, with up to 2000 on site at one time during the peak building phase.\nMore than 1,000 iron columns supported 2,224 trellis girders and 30 miles of guttering, comprising 4,000 tons of iron in all.\n\nFirst, stakes were driven into the ground to roughly mark out the positions for the cast iron columns; these points were then set precisely by theodolite measurements. Then the concrete foundations were poured, and the base plates for the columns were set into them. Once the foundations were in place, the erection of the modules proceeded rapidly. Connector brackets were attached to the top of each column before erection, and these were then hoisted into position. Since the project took place before the development of powered cranes, the raising of the columns was done manually using shears (or shear legs), a simple crane mechanism. These consisted of two strong poles, which were set several meters apart at the base and then lashed together at the top to form a triangle; this was stabilized and kept vertical by guy ropes fixed to the apex, stretched taut and tied to stakes driven into the ground some distance away. Using pulleys and ropes hung from the apex of the shear, the navvies hoisted the columns, girders and other parts into place.\n\nAs soon as two adjacent columns had been erected, a girder was hoisted into place between them and bolted onto the connectors. The columns were erected in opposite pairs, then two more girders were connected to form a self-supporting square—this was the basic frame of each module. The shears would then be moved along and an adjoining bay constructed. When a reasonable number of bays had been completed, the columns for the upper floor were erected (longer shear-legs were used for this, but the operation was essentially the same as for the ground floor). Once the ground floor structure was complete, the final assembly of the upper floor followed rapidly.\n\nFor the glazing, Paxton used larger versions of machines he had originally devised for the Great Stove at Chatsworth, installing on-site production line systems, powered by steam engines, that dressed and finished the building parts. These included a machine that mechanically grooved the wooden window sash bars, and a painting machine that automatically dipped the parts in paint and then passed them through a series of rotating brushes to remove the excess.\nThe last major components to be put into place were the sixteen semi-circular ribs of the vaulted transept, which were also the only major structural parts that were made of wood. These were raised into position as eight pairs, and all were fixed into place within a week. Thanks to the simplicity of Paxton's design and the combined efficiency of the building contractor and their suppliers, the entire structure was assembled with extraordinary speed—the team of 80 glaziers could fix more than 18,000 panes of sheet glass in a week—and the building was complete and ready to receive exhibits in just five months.\n\nWhen completed, The Crystal Palace provided an unrivaled space for exhibits, since it was essentially a self-supporting shell standing on slim iron columns, with no internal structural walls whatsoever. Because it was covered almost entirely in glass, it also needed no artificial lighting during the day, thereby reducing the Exhibition's running costs.\n\nFull-size elm trees growing in the park were enclosed within the central exhibition hall near the tall Crystal Fountain. Sparrows became a nuisance; shooting was out of the question in a glass building. Queen Victoria mentioned this problem to the Duke of Wellington, who offered the solution, \"Sparrowhawks, Ma'am\".\n\nPaxton was acclaimed worldwide for his achievement, and was knighted by Queen Victoria in recognition of his work. The project was engineered by Sir William Cubitt; Paxton's construction partner was the ironwork contractor Sir Charles Fox's Fox and Henderson, whose director Charles Fox was also knighted for his contribution. The 900,000 square feet (84,000 m) of glass was provided by the Chance Brothers glassworks in Smethwick. They were the only glassworks capable of fulfilling such a large order and had to bring in labour from France to meet it in time. The final dimensions were long by wide. The building was high, with on the ground floor alone.\n\nThe Great Exhibition was opened on 1 May 1851 by Queen Victoria. It was the first of the World's Fair exhibitions of culture and industry. There were some 100,000 objects, displayed along more than ten miles, by over 15,000 contributors. Britain occupied half the display space inside with exhibits from the home country and the Empire. France was the largest foreign contributor. The exhibits were grouped into four main categories—Raw Materials, Machinery, Manufacturers and Fine Arts. The exhibits ranged from the Koh-i-Noor diamond, Sevres porcelain and music organs to a massive hydraulic press and a fire-engine. There was also a 27-foot tall Crystal Fountain.\n\nIn the first week, the prices were £1;then reduced to 5 shillings for the next three weeks, a price which still effectively limited entrance to middle-class and aristocratic visitors. The working classes finally came to the exhibition on Monday 26 May, when weekday prices were reduced to one shilling (although the price was two shillings and sixpence on Fridays, and still 5 shillings on Saturdays). There were over six million admissions counted at the toll-gates, although the proportion which were repeat/returning visitors is not known. The event made a surplus of £186,000 (equivalent to £), money which was used to found the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington.\n\nThe Crystal Palace had the first major installation of public toilets, the \"Retiring Rooms\", in which sanitary engineer George Jennings installed his \"Monkey Closet\" flushing lavatory (initially just for men, but later catering for women also). During the exhibition, 827,280 visitors each paid one penny to use them. It is often suggested that the euphemism \"spending a penny\" originated at the Exhibition but the phrase is more likely to date from the 1890s when public lavatories, fitted with penny coin-operated locks, were first established by British local authorities.\n\nThe Great Exhibition closed on 11 October 1851.\n\nThe life of the Great Exhibition was limited to six months, after which something had to be done with the building. Against the wishes of Parliamentary opponents, a consortium of eight businessmen including Samuel Laing and Leo Schuster who were both board members of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR), formed a suitable holding company and proposed that the edifice be erected on a property named Penge Place that had been excised from Penge Common at the top of Sydenham Hill.\nThe construction of the building began on Sydenham Hill in 1852. The new building, while incorporating most of the constructional parts of the Hyde Park building, was so completely different in form as to be properly considered a quite different structure – a 'Beaux-arts' form in glass and metal. The main gallery was redesigned and covered with a new barrel-vaulted roof, the central transept was greatly enlarged and made even higher, and two new transepts were added at either end of the main gallery. It was modified and enlarged so much that it extended beyond the boundary of Penge Place, which was also the boundary between Surrey and Kent. The reconstruction was recorded for posterity by Philip Henry Delamotte, and his photographs were widely disseminated in his published works.\n\nWithin just two years the rebuilt Palace building was complete, and on 10 June 1854, Queen Victoria again performed an opening ceremony, in the presence of 40,000 guests.\n\nSeveral localities claim to be the area to which the building was moved. The street address of the Crystal Palace was Sydenham (SE26) after 1917, but the actual building and parklands were in Penge. When built, most of the buildings were in the County of Surrey, as were the majority of grounds, but in 1899 the county boundary was moved, transferring the entire site to Penge Urban District in Kent. The site is now within the Crystal Palace Ward of the London Borough of Bromley.\nTwo railway stations were opened to serve the permanent exhibition:\n\nThe Low Level Station is still in use as , while the only remains of the High Level Station are the subway under the Parade with its Italian mosaic roofing, a Grade II listed building.\n\nThe South Gate is served by Penge West Railway Station. For some time this station was on an atmospheric railway. This is often confused with a 550-metre pneumatic passenger railway which was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864, which was known as the Crystal Palace pneumatic railway.\n\nDozens of experts such as Matthew Digby Wyatt and Owen Jones were hired to create a series of courts that provided a narrative of the history of fine art. Amongst these were Augustus Pugin's Mediaeval Court from the Great Exhibition, as well as courts illustrating Egyptian, Alhambra, Roman, Renaissance, Pompeian, and Grecian art and many others. During the year of re-opening 18 handbooks were published in the Crystal Palace Library by Bradbury & Evans as guides to the new installations. Many of these were written by the specialists involved in creating and curating the new displays. So the 1854 guide to the Egyptian Court, destroyed in the 1866 fire, was entitled: 'The Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace. Described by Owen Jones, architect, and Joseph Bonomi, sculptor'. That which included a description of the dinosaurs was entitled: 'Geology and Inhabitants of the Ancient World. Described by Richard Owen, FRS. The animals constructed by B.W.Hawkins, FGS'. In the central transept was the 4,000-piece Grand Orchestra built around the 4,500-pipe Great Organ. There was a concert room with over 4,000 seats that hosted successful Handel Festivals for many years. The performance spaces hosted concerts, exhibits, and public entertainment.\nThe Centre Transept of the Crystal Palace also once housed a circus and was the scene of daring feats by acts such as the tightrope walker Charles Blondin. Over the years many world leaders visited the Crystal Palace, and were accorded special festivals, with extended published programs. That for Garibaldi was entitled \"General Garibaldi's Italian Reception and Concert Saturday April 16, 1864\"; and that for the Shah: \"Crystal Palace. Grand Fête in honour of His Majesty The Shah of Persia KG. Saturday July 6th\" (1889). From the beginning general programs were printed, at first for the summer season, and then on a daily basis. So for instance that for the summer of 1864 \"Programme of arrangements for the eleventh season, commencing on the 1st May, 1864\" included the Shakespeare Tercentenary Festival and a course by designer Christopher Dresser. The daily \"Programme for Monday October 6th (1873) included a harvest exhibition of fruit, and the Australasian Collection, formed by H E Pain, of materials from Tasmania, New Caledonia, Solomon Islands, Australia, NZ; and grand military fete was also on offer. Many of these publications were printed by Dickens and Evans, that is Charles Dickens jnr., Dickens' son working with his father-in-law Frederick Evans. Another feature of the early programming were Christmas pantomimes, with published librettos, for instance Harry Lemon's 'Dick Whittington and His Wonderful Cat. Crystal Palace Christmas 1869–70' (London 1869).\n\nIn 1868, the world's first aeronautical exhibition was held in the Crystal Palace. In 1871, the world's first cat show, organised by Harrison Weir, was held there. Other shows, such as dog shows, pigeon shows, honey, flower shows, as well as the first national motor show were also held at the Palace. The match which later has been dubbed the world's first bandy match was held at the Palace in 1875; at the time, the game was called \"hockey on the ice\". The new site was also the location of one of Charles Spurgeon's sermons, without amplification, before a crowd of 23,654 people on 7 October 1857.\n\nA colourful description of a visit to the Crystal Palace appears in John Davidson's poem 'The Crystal Palace' published in 1909.\n\nIn 1909, Robert Baden-Powell first noticed the interest of girls in Scouting while attending a Boy Scout meeting at Crystal Palace. This observation later led to the formation of Girl Guides, then Girl Scouts.\nIn 1911, the Festival of Empire was held at the building to mark the coronation of George V and Queen Mary. Large pavilions were built for and by the colonies, that for Canada for instance replicating the Parliament in Ottawa. A good record of the Festival is provided by the photogravure plates in the sale catalogue published shortly afterwards by Knight, Frank and Rutley and Horne & Co \"The Crystal Palace Sydenham To be sold at auction on Tuesday 28th November\" (London, 1911)\n\nDuring the First World War, it was used as a naval training establishment under the name of HMS \"Victory VI\", informally known as HMS \"Crystal Palace\". More than 125,000 men from the Royal Naval Division, Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and Royal Naval Air Service were trained for war at \"Victory VI\".\n\nTowards the end of the First War World War, the Crystal Palace re-opened as the site of the first Imperial War Museum; in 1920 this major initiative was fully launched with a program as the 'Imperial War Museum and Great Victory Exhibition Crystal Palace' (published by Photocrom). A few years later the Imperial War Museum moved to South Kensington, and then in the 1930s to its present site Geraldine Mary Harmsworth Park, formerly Bedlam.\n\nOn 15–20 October 1934 the Pageant of Labour was held at the Crystal Palace.\n\nThe development of ground and gardens of the park cost considerably more than the rebuilt Crystal Palace. Edward Milner designed the Italian Garden and fountains, the Great Maze, and the English Landscape Garden. Raffaele Monti was hired to design and build much of the external statuary around the fountain basins, and the urns, tazzas and vases. The sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins was commissioned to make 33 lifesized models of the (then) newly discovered dinosaurs and other extinct animals in the park. The Palace and its park became the location of many shows, concerts and exhibitions, as well as sporting events after the construction of various sports grounds on the site. The FA Cup Final was held here between 1895 and 1914. On the new site were also various buildings that housed educational establishments such as the Crystal Palace School of Art, Science, and Literature as well as engineering schools.\nJoseph Paxton was first and foremost a gardener, and his layout of gardens, fountains, terraces and cascades left no doubt as to his ability. One thing he did have a problem with was water supply. Such was his enthusiasm that thousands of gallons of water were needed to feed the myriad fountains and cascades abounding in the Park: the two main jets were high. Water towers were duly constructed, but the weight of water in the raised tanks caused them to collapse. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was consulted and came up with plans for two mighty water towers, one at the north end of the building and one at the south. Each supported a tremendous load of water, which was gathered from three reservoirs, at either end of and in the middle of the park. The grand fountains and cascades were opened, again in the presence of the Queen, who got wet when a gust of wind swept mists of spray over the royal carriage.\n\nWhile the original palace cost £150,000 (equivalent to £ in ), the move to Sydenham cost £1,300,000—(£ in ), burdening the company with a debt it never repaid, partly because admission fees were depressed by the inability to cater for Sunday visitors in its early years: many people worked every day except Sunday, when the Palace was closed. The Lord's Day Observance Society held that people should not be encouraged to work at the Palace on Sunday, and that if people wanted to visit, then their employers should give them time off during the working week. However, the Palace was eventually open on Sundays by 1860, and it was recorded that 40,000 visitors came on a Sunday in May 1861.\n\nBy the 1890s the Palace's popularity and state of repair had deteriorated; the appearance of stalls and booths had made it a more downmarket attraction.\n\nIn the years after the Festival of Empire the building fell into disrepair, as the huge debt and maintenance costs became unsustainable, and in 1911 bankruptcy was declared. In 1914 the Earl of Plymouth bought it to save it from the developers. A public subscription subsequently bought it from the Earl for the nation.\n\nIn the 1920s, a board of trustees was set up under the guidance of manager Sir Henry Buckland. He is said to have been a firm but fair man, who had a great love for the Crystal Palace, and soon set about restoring the deteriorating building. The restoration not only brought visitors back, but also meant that the Palace started to make a small profit once more. Buckland and his staff also worked on improving the fountains and gardens, including the Thursday evening displays of fireworks by Brocks.\n\nOn 30 November 1936 came the final catastrophe – fire. Within hours the Palace was destroyed: the glow was visible across eight counties. That night, Buckland was walking his dog near the palace, with his daughter (Crystal Buckland, named after the palace) when they noticed a red glow within. Inside, he found two of his employees fighting a small office fire, that had started after an explosion in the women's cloakroom. Realising that it was a serious fire, they called the Penge fire brigade. But, even though 89 fire engines and over 400 firemen arrived they were unable to extinguish it. (The fire spread quickly in the high winds that night, because it could consume the dry old timber flooring, and the huge quantity of flammable materials in the building.) Buckland said, \"In a few hours we have seen the end of the Crystal Palace. Yet it will live in the memories not only of Englishmen, but the whole world\". 100,000 people came to Sydenham Hill to watch the blaze, among them Winston Churchill, who said, \"This is the end of an age\".\n\nJust as in 1866, when the north transept burnt down, the building was not adequately insured to cover the cost of rebuilding (at least two million pounds).\n\nThe South Tower and much of the lower level of the Palace had been used for tests by television pioneer John Logie Baird for his mechanical television experiments, and much of his work was destroyed in the fire. Baird himself is reported to have suspected the fire was a deliberate act of sabotage against his work on developing television, but the true cause remains unknown.\n\nThe last singer to perform there before the fire was the Australian ballad contralto Essie Ackland.\n\nComing as it did just as the abdication crisis was reaching its terminal stage, the building's destruction was widely seen as symbolic of the end of King Edward VIII's brief and controversial reign.\n\nAll that was left standing after the 1936 fire were the two water towers. The south tower to the right of the Crystal Palace entrance was taken down shortly after the fire, as the damage sustained had undermined its integrity and it presented a major risk to houses nearby.\n\nThe north tower was demolished with explosives in 1941. No reason was given for its removal, although it was rumoured that it was to remove a landmark for WWII German aircraft, but Luftwaffe bombers actually navigated their way to Central London by tracking the River Thames.\nThe Crystal Palace grounds were also used as a manufacturing base for aircraft radar screens and other hi-tech equipment of the time. This remained a secret until well after the war.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Palace, the High Level Branch station fell into disuse, and was finally shut in 1954.\n\nAfter the war the site was used for a number of purposes. Between 1927 and 1972 the Crystal Palace motor racing circuit was located in the park, supported by the Greater London Council, but the noise was unpopular with nearby residents and racing hours were soon regulated under a high court judgment. The Crystal Palace transmitting station was built on the former Aquarium site in the mid-1950s and still serves as one of London's main television transmission masts.\n\nBetween 1971 and 1980, a series of annual \"Crystal Palace Garden Parties\" took place in the summer months. Many established as well as aspiring pop artists made their appearances at the Crystal Palace Bowl, including The Beach Boys, Pink Floyd, Lou Reed, Melanie, Mahavishnu Orchestra, John Cale, Santana, Bob Marley, The Chieftains, and Golden Earring.\n\nOver the years, numerous proposals for the former site of the Palace have not come to fruition.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "421012", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=421012", "title": "War reparations", "text": "War reparations\n\nWar reparations are payments made after a war by the vanquished to the victors.\n\nThey are intended to cover damage or injury inflicted during a war. Generally, the term \"war reparations\" refers to money or goods changing hands, but not to the annexation of land.\n\nMaking the defeated party pay a war indemnity is a common practice with a long history.\n\nIn Ancient history, the imposition of reparations on a defeated enemy was often the beginning of forcing that enemy to pay a regular tribute.\n\nRome imposed large indemnities on Carthage after the First ( Treaty of Lutatius ) and Second Punic Wars.\n\nSome war reparations induced changes in monetary policy. For example, the French payment following the Franco-Prussian war played a major role in Germany's decision to adopt the gold standard. The 230 million silver taels in reparations imposed on defeated China after the First Sino-Japanese War led Japan to a similar decision.\n\nFollowing the Treaty of Paris (1815), defeated France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities. France was also to pay additional money to cover the cost of providing additional defensive fortifications to be built by neighbouring Coalition countries. In proportion to its GDP, it's the most expensive war reparation ever paid by a country.\n\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War, according to conditions of Treaty of Frankfurt (May 10, 1871), France was obliged to pay a war indemnity of 5 billion gold francs in 5 years. The indemnity was proportioned, according to population, to be the exact equivalent to the indemnity imposed by Napoleon on Prussia in 1807. German troops remained in parts of France until the last installment of the indemnity was paid in September 1873, ahead of schedule.\n\nFollowing the Greco-Turkish War (1897), defeated Greece was forced to pay a large war indemnity to Turkey (£4 million). Greece, which was already in default, was compelled to permit oversight of its public finances by an international financial commission.\n\nRussians agreed to pay reparations to the Central Powers when Russia exited the war in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (which was repudiated by the Bolshevik government eight months later). Bulgaria paid reparations of 2.25 billion gold francs (90 million pounds) to the Entente, according to the Treaty of Neuilly.\n\nGermany agreed to pay reparations of 132 billion gold marks to the Triple Entente in the Treaty of Versailles, which were then cancelled in 1932 with Germany only having paid a part of the sum. This still left Germany with debts it had incurred in order to finance the reparations, and these were revised by the Agreement on German External Debts in 1953. After another pause pending the reunification of Germany, the last installment of these debt repayments was paid on 3 October 2010.\n\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany extracted payments from occupied countries and compelled loans. In addition, countries were obliged to provide resources, and forced labour.\n\nAfter World War II, according to the Potsdam conference held between July 17 and August 2, 1945, Germany was to pay the Allies US$23 billion mainly in machinery and manufacturing plants. Reparations to the Soviet Union stopped in 1953. Large numbers of factories were dismantled or destroyed. Dismantling in the west stopped in 1950.\n\nBeginning before the German surrender and continuing for the next two years, the United States pursued a vigorous program of harvesting all technological and scientific know-how as well as all patents and many leading scientists in Germany (known as Operation Paperclip). Historian John Gimbel, in his book \"Science Technology and Reparations: Exploitation and Plunder in Postwar Germany\", states that the \"intellectual reparations\" taken by the U.S. and the UK amounted to close to $10 billion.\nGerman reparations were partly to be in the form of forced labor. By 1947, approximately 4,000,000 German POWs and civilians were used as forced labor (under various headings, such as \"reparations labor\" or \"enforced labor\") in the Soviet Union, France, the UK, Belgium and in Germany in U.S run \"Military Labor Service Units\".\nAccording to the Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947, Italy agreed to pay reparations of about US$125 million to Yugoslavia, US$105 million to Greece, US$100 million to the Soviet Union, US$25 million to Ethiopia, and US$5 million to Albania.\n\nFinland agreed to pay reparations of US$300 million to the Soviet Union.\nHungary agreed to pay reparations of US$200 million to the Soviet Union, US$100 million to Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia. Romania agreed to pay reparations of US$300 million to the Soviet Union, but the real sum that Romania had to pay was $1.2 billion. Romania paid $5.6 million in 1945 and was coerced to pay through SovRom $2 billion. Bulgaria agreed to pay reparations of $50 million to Greece and $25 million to Yugoslavia.\nAccording to the articles of these treaties, the value of US$ was prescribed as 35 US dollars to one troy ounce of pure gold.\n\nThe Treaty of Shimonoseki, signed on April 17, 1895, obliged China to pay an indemnity of 200 million silver taels (¥3.61 billion) to Japan; and to open the ports of Shashi, Chongqing, Suzhou and Hangzhou to Japanese trade.\n\nAccording to Article 14 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan (1951): \"Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers\". War reparations made pursuant to the San Francisco Peace Treaty with Japan (1951) include: reparations amounting to US$550 million (198 billion yen 1956) were made to the Philippines, and US$39 million (14.04 billion yen 1959) to Viet Nam; payment to the International Committee of the Red Cross to compensate prisoners of war (POW) of 4.5 million pounds sterling (4.54109 billion yen) was made; and Japan relinquished all overseas assets approximately US$23.681 billion (379.499 billion yen).\n\nJapan signed the peace treaty with 49 nations in 1952 and concluded 54 bilateral agreements that included those with Burma (US$20 million 1954, 1963), the Republic of Korea (US$300 million 1965), Indonesia (US$223.08 million 1958), the Philippines (525 million US dollars/52.94 billion yen 1967), Malaysia (25 million Malaysian dollars/2.94 billion Yen 1967), Thailand (5.4 billion Yen 1955), Micronesia (1969), Laos (1958), Cambodia (1959), Mongolia (1977), Spain ($5.5 million 1957), Switzerland, Netherlands ($10 million 1956), Sweden and Denmark. Payments of reparations started in 1955, lasted for 23 years and ended in 1977. For countries that renounced any reparations from Japan, it agreed to pay indemnity and/or grants in accordance with bilateral agreements. In the Joint Communiqué of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China (1972), People's Republic of China renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan. In the Soviet–Japanese Joint Declaration of 1956, the Soviet Union waived its rights to reparations from Japan, and both Japan and the Soviet Union waived all reparations claims arising from war. Additionally, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), under President J. R. Jayewardene, declined war reparations from Japan.\n\nThe government of the United States under the Reagan Administration officially apologized for the Japanese American internment during World War II in 1988 and paid reparations to former internees and their descendants.\n\nAfter the Gulf War, Iraq accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which declared Iraq's financial liability for damage caused in its invasion of Kuwait. The United Nations Compensation Commission (\"UNCC\") was established, and US$350 billion in claims were filed by governments, corporations, and individuals. Funds for these payments were to come from a 30% share of Iraq's oil revenues from the oil for food program. It was not anticipated that US$350 billion would become available for total payment of all reparations claims, so several schedules of prioritization were created over the years. The UNCC says that its prioritization of claims by natural people, ahead of claims by governments and entities or corporations (legal persons), \"marked a significant step in the evolution of international claims practice.\"\n\nPayments under this reparations program continue; as of July 2010, the UNCC stated that it had actually distributed US$18.4 billion to claimants.\n\nThere have been attempts to codify reparations both in the Statutes of the International Criminal Court and the UN Basic Principles on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19996292", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19996292", "title": "Workplace aggression", "text": "Workplace aggression\n\nWorkplace aggression is a specific type of aggression which occurs in the workplace. Workplace aggression can include a wide range of behaviors, ranging from verbal acts (e.g., insulting someone or spreading rumors) to physical attacks (e.g., punching or slapping).\n\nAggression, in general, is any behavior an individual carries out with the intent to harm another person or group of people. The aggressor must believe that their behavior is harmful to their target, and that the target is motivated to avoid this behavior. A defining feature of aggression is the intent or motivation to harm. For a behavior to be considered an aggressive act, the individual committing the behavior must intend harm. In other words, if they inflict harm on another without that specific intent, it is not considered aggression.\n\nAggression can occur in a variety of situations. One important domain to understand aggression is in the workplace. Workplace aggression is considered a specific type of counterproductive work behavior (CWB) and is defined as \"any act of aggression, physical assault, threatening or coercive behavior that causes physical or emotional harm in a work setting.\"\n\nSome researchers specify that workplace aggression only includes efforts to harm coworkers, former coworkers, current employers, or past employers. Others include in workplace aggression any behaviors intended to harm another person that are enacted in a workplace.\n\nTo delineate the range of behaviors that can be considered aggressive workplace behaviors, researchers have developed schemes of classification for workplace aggression. Neuman and Baron (1998) offer these three dimensions that encompass the range of workplace aggression:\n\nIn an attempt to further break down the wide range of aggressive workplace behaviors, Baron and Neuman (1996) also classify workplace aggression based on these three dichotomies:\n\nAggressive acts can take any possible combination of these three dichotomies. For example, failing to deny false rumors about a coworker would be classified as verbal–passive–indirect. Purposely avoiding the presence of a coworker you know is searching for your assistance could be considered physical–passive–direct.\n\nOther researchers offer a classification system based on the aggressor's relationship to the victim.\n\nIn the workplace much of the aggressive behavior enacted on targets are considered covert in nature. According to Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back, covert behaviors are those behaviors that are designed to disguise the aggressive behavior or aggressive intentions from the target. Overt aggression, on the other hand, includes behaviors that do not hide the aggressive intent and are open in their intentions. Typically, covert aggression is verbal, indirect, and passive in nature, while overt aggression reflects the physical, direct, and active side of the dichotomies.\n\nWorkplace aggression often takes the form of covert behaviors. This can be attributed to what Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Lagerspetz call the effect/danger ratio. This term refers to the aggressors' subjective evaluation of the relative effects and danger of committing an aggressive act. For an aggressor, it is ideal to have a larger effect/danger ratio. In other words, aggressors want an act to have a large effect with relatively low risk of danger to themselves.\n\nIndividuals in the workplace are subjected to prolonged exposure to each other. This prolonged exposure means the victims of the aggressors' actions likely have more time to retaliate, thus increasing the danger aspect of the ratio. Also, workplaces are often communal in nature. That is, people often work in groups and are surrounded by others. The presence of others acts as a built in audience that could \"punish\" the aggressor for harming a victim. It is for these reasons that individuals often choose covert forms of aggression.\n\nPredictors of workplace aggression can occur at both the organizational level and the individual level. Organizational factors examined here include organizational justice, supervision and surveillance, changes in the work environment, and specific job characteristics. At the individual level, gender, age, and alcohol consumption are examined here. While this is not a comprehensive listing of predictors, it does cover the majority of workplace aggression predictors addressed in the empirical literature.\n\nPerceived interpersonal justice, the degree to which people feel they are treated with fairness and respect, is negatively related to both psychological and physical aggression against supervisors. Inness, Barling, and Turner found similar results; perceived interpersonal injustice was related to workplace aggression in participants' primary and secondary jobs.\n\nMoreover, perceived procedural justice, the extent to which formal organizational procedures are assumed fair, is related to workplace aggression against supervisors. Greenberg and Barling found that the greater the perceptions of procedural justice, the less workplace aggression was reported.\n\nThe most extreme forms of workplace aggression may result from personnel decisions, such as individual termination and mass layoffs. In 2009 a man killed one and wounded five others at his former place of employment two years after he was let go from the company due to poor performance. A similar event occurred in 2012 when a man shot and killed four employees and then himself after losing his job earlier that day.\n\nDownsizing is a tactic used by organizations where there is a slow-down in business in order to remain profitable or minimize losses. This tactic is most commonly observed during widespread economic hardships, such as the Great Recession of 2008.\n\nPerceived job insecurity, or feelings of impending termination, has been found to be a predictor of workplace aggression.\n\nWorkplace surveillance (employee monitoring) is positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors, such that the greater the number of employee surveillance methods used, the greater the amount of workplace aggression. Furthermore, supervisory control over work performance has also been shown positively related to workplace aggression against supervisors. This type of behavior has been observed both adults and teenagers.\n\nBaron and Neuman found that certain changes in the work environment can lead to increased aggression that they attribute to heightened anxiety and stress. Specifically, pay cuts or freezes, changes in management, increased monitoring systems (e.g., increased computer monitoring), increased diversity, and the increased use of part-time employees all were related to higher levels of workplace aggression.\n\nOther antecedents of workplace aggression found in the literature are specific job characteristics. LeBlanc and Kelloway found that certain job features, such as handling guns or collecting valuable items, were significantly more related to workplace aggression.\n\nHarvey and Keashly found that length of time at work was able to predict workplace aggression such that the longer hours a person worked, the more likely they were to report aggression. The authors attributed this finding to two possible reasons. First, the more hours worked, the greater statistical probability of being victimized. Second, longer hours worked could contribute to fatigue and frustration. This in turn may increase the likelihood of aggressive actions towards coworkers.\n\nIn some studies, gender has been shown a significant predictor of workplace aggression. For example, being male is significantly related to reports of aggression against supervisors. Furthermore, males are more likely to commit aggressive acts in the presence of other men. This can be attributed to societal cultures that dictate \"codes of honor.\" Females, on the other hand, are no more likely to act aggressively in either the presence of females or males.\n\nAge is significantly related to aggression. In their study of age and job performance, Ng and Feldman found that older workers (age 40 or older) engaged in less workplace aggression than younger workers.\n\nThe frequency and amount of alcohol typically consumed by a person predicts aggressive behavior. Those who consume more alcohol more frequently are more likely to aggress against a coworker. The Hebei tractor rampage began as workplace aggression following alcohol consumption.\n\nCyber-aggression or cyber-harassment:\n\nWhat many do not realize that the phenomenon of cyber-bullying often associated with teenage culture has spread to the workplace in a variety of ways. While this trend is seemingly silent and slow growing, its effects are considered equally hurtful as any form of harassment.\n\nOften, cyber-aggression is the result of individuals in a workplace being offended/upset/or feeling threatened by organizational problems. They then resort to virtual communication as a form of retaliation. These actions are referred to as \"flaming\" by Whitty & Carr, or essentially when an individual online writes with hostility towards a particular person or group of people.\n\nInstant messaging has become both a help and a hindrance in organizations. The ease of use with instant messaging, is partially to blame, \"Employees can see who else is available, and if it’s someone they want to talk to, they’re able to connect in real time\". While this has become an extremely useful tool in workplace communication, instant messengers such at AIM or MSN Messenger are not easily regulated from a managerial aspect, which leads to employees being able to have private conversations on a public platform. These conversations can foster aggressive talk and lead to potentially hurtful information being spread among an organization. Some argue that instant messages are beneficial to the work process because it can easily resolve problems without having to distract the person via phone and you don’t have to wait for an email response.\n\nThis is one of the most prevalent tools used in cyber-aggression because of its prevalence in workplace communications. Often upset workers send loaded messages and attach the email to a large group of co-workers that are not involved in the issue to bring attention to it. An article from the Travel Trade Gazette give some advice to avoid being aggressive in emails.\n\nThis is one of the fastest growing ways that workers can lash out against each other. The opportunity is high for individuals to be aggressive in a highly public and open forum. Many choose to speak out at their co-workers or superiors because it is a way for them to vent their feelings while not having to say these things face to face.\n\nLike the array of behaviors considered workplace aggression, the consequences of workplace aggression are also extensive. For example, Ng and Feldman suggest that \"acts of workplace aggression can cause bodily harm to employees, pose physical danger for customers, create public relations crises, and harm the business reputation of the firm as a whole.\" The outcomes of workplace aggression addressed here include the health and well-being of targeted employees and job performance. Gender differences in outcomes are also addressed.\n\nSeverity of the repercussions may be influenced by the position of the aggressor. Hershcovis and Barling found that \"...supervisor aggression has the strongest adverse effects across attitudinal and behavioral outcomes\", followed by co-worker aggression and outsider aggression.\n\nWorkplace aggression can have devastating effects on an organization's employees. For example, it has been found that targets of workplace aggression report lower levels of well-being. Other studies have shown that aggression in the workplace can cause the victims of such behaviors to suffer from health problems and displaced aggression - including perpetuating aggression towards random strangers in the street. Bjorkqvist, Osterman, and Hjelt-Back even found that targets exhibited symptoms similar to those of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as anxiety and depression. . Sorensen et al. found possible associations between harassment at work and well-being measures of lower back pain and sleep deficiency among a sample of hospital workers.\n\nResearch has looked at the negative impacts of workplace aggression on team performance and particularly team effectiveness as was evidenced in a recent study by Aube and Rousseau.\n\nVictims of workplace aggression may suffer from reduced job satisfaction. Lapierre, Spector, and Leck found that those who perceived being targets of workplace aggression reported significantly lower overall job satisfaction. Similarly, those who perceive abuse from their supervisors report lower levels of job satisfaction.\n\nResearch has shown that males and females react to workplace aggression differently. While both males and females have reported lower well-being after experiencing aggression in the workplace, studies indicate that the relationship between experienced workplace aggression and decreased well-being was stronger for men. In one study, results showed that men who experienced work aggression were more likely to report physical, psychosocial, affective, and cognitive problems. This study also showed that the type of aggression, whether it is overt or covert, did not matter for these outcomes. The study attributes these findings to the idea of modern-day masculinity, which stresses achievement and success in the workplace.\n\nFor females, nonsexual aggression has been found to have a stronger impact on job satisfaction than sexual aggression. Also, nonsexual aggression has a stronger relationship with job satisfaction in females than in males.\n\nPrevention programs focus on reducing instances of workplace aggression. Programs that incorporate personnel selection, organizational sanctions, and training are recommended.\n\nBased on a workplace prevention program developed by the United States Postal Service (USPS), Neuman and Baron encourage organizations to use personnel screening and testing to identify potential employees who are likely to behave aggressively before they are even hired. This proactive strategy prevents individuals who are predisposed to aggress from even entering the workplace.\n\nExplicit policies regarding workplace aggression may help organizations to reduce aggression. Employees who perceived that their organization would punish workplace aggressors reported less workplace aggression even when their perceptions of interpersonal justice were high. Neuman and Baron also suggest using organizational policies to curb workplace aggression and to shape strong anti-aggressive organizational norms.\n\nTraining is also an important part of a prevention program. Neuman and Baron suggest that training for both supervisors and subordinates should focus on teaching employees methods for dealing with aggression. Similarly, Rai advises that appropriate training should inform employees that management takes threats seriously, encourage employees to report incidents, and demonstrate management's commitment to deal with reported incidents.\n\nOrganizational support can influence the effects of workplace aggression. Schat and Kelloway isolated two forms of organizational support: instrumental and informational. Instrumental support refers to providing some type of assistance directly to an afflicted individuals, whereas information support refers to providing employees with self-help informational resources.\n\n"}

Released theatrically on 1,000 screens across Turkey and Europe in October 2012, the film was never released commercially in the United States, but premiered on ATV television on 17 March 2015.\n\nThe story of the film is about the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I on the Gallipoli Peninsula in Turkey in 1915. The film covers the resurrection of Turkey following its defeat in the Balkan War, through depictions of Sergeant Mehmet Ali (Ali Ersan Duru) from Biga, Corporal Seyit and many others. To help Russia and threaten Constantinople, the Allies try to force through the Dardanelles Straight with a large fleet. Through a series of historical sketches, the film documents how they were defeated despite many difficulties and hardships.\n\nThe film received generally favorable reception across Turkey. Film critics were appreciative of the battle scenes, but found forgivable flaws with scripting and acting. Reviewer Atilla Dorsay said it was an over the top drama which, while a bit over-done, was not bad for its kind in its depicting events of the greatest importance to the Turkish nation. Reviewer Mehmet Açar felt the resistance soul filled the audience, as when the film aimed to feel the spirit of resistance in Çanakkale, it managed to do so. While dialogue was problematic in drama scenes the battle scenes were successful. Reviewer Kerem Akça felt the film was worth the effort and in places quite impressive, despite significant weaknesses with script and acting. Reviewer Uğur Vardan felt the real issue brought forth in the film was poverty in the film looking at both sides of imperialism. While the production was highly successful in items such as costume design, it was extremely weak in terms of side issues. In speaking about various films releasing in Turkey to commemorate the centenary of the Battle of Gallipoli, \"Variety\" noted that film \"Canakkale 1915\" was \"based on the bestselling historical fiction by Turgut Ozakman\" and that it \"focuses on the battle as a foundation for the Turkish Republic\". \"Hurriyet Daily News\" called the film \"a sure hit in the box office\". \"Daily Sabah\" reported on \"Water Diviner\" and in speaking of three other recent Turkish films dealing with the Gallipoli battle, wrote \"\"Çanakkale 1915\" was the most successful of the three films\", screening for 43 weeks, drawing 918,181 viewers, and having a box office return of a whopping $1.00 [[Turkish lira]= 0.00]. \"[[Today's Zaman]]\" wrote \"director Yeşim Sezgin's newest \"Çanakkale 1915\" might actually outdo [[Sinan Çetin]]'s \"[[Çanakkale Çocukları]]\" in terms of its aggression, opportunism and crooked reductionism.\" The reviewer found it frustrating that some scenes \"are so blatantly full of improbable valor that they border on the comical because the filmmakers have taken themselves too seriously as they leave behind any kind of introspection.\"\n\n[[Category:2012 films]]\n[[Category:2010s historical films]]\n[[Category:Turkish films]]\n[[Category:Turkish historical films]]\n[[Category:Turkish war films]]\n[[Category:Turkish-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about the Gallipoli Campaign]]\n[[Category:Films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Epic films based on actual events]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1915]]\n[[Category:Films set in Turkey]]\n[[Category:World War I films]]\n[[Category:World War I films set in the Middle East]]"}
