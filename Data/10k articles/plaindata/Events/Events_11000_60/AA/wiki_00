The constituency's Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Maurice Macmillan, had died suddenly at the age of 63. He had recently acquired the courtesy title of Viscount Macmillan of Ovendon when his father (who would ultimately outlive him by nearly three years) was created the Earl of Stockton on 24 February 1984.\n\nMaurice Macmillan was a Cabinet minister in Edward Heath's government in the 1970s, as well as the son of former Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, who was still alive when his son died. He had been South West Surrey's MP since the constituency was created for the 1983 general election, having previously been MP for Farnham from 1966. Macmillan had first entered Parliament at the 1955 general election representing the constituency of Halifax, but had lost his seat at the 1964 general election.\n\nSix candidates were nominated. They are listed below in descending order of votes.\n\n1. Mrs Virginia Hilda Brunette Maxwell Bottomley (born 1948), was the Conservative candidate. She was a part-time psychiatric social worker, at the time of the by-election. She is married to Peter Bottomley who has also served as a Conservative MP.\n\nMrs Bottomley had contested the Isle of Wight in the 1983 general election. Subsequent to the by-election she retained the seat, until she retired from the House of Commons and was granted a Life Peerage in 2005. She served as a member of John Major's cabinet from 1992 until 1997.\n\n2. The Liberal Party candidate, representing the SDP-Liberal Alliance, was freelance journalist and broadcaster Gavin Douglas Scott (born 1950). Since the by-election Scott has become known as a screenwriter.\n\n3. The Labour nominee was Mrs Barbara Maureen Roche (born 1954), a barrister. Mrs Roche has subsequently been elected to Parliament and has served as a junior minister.\n\n4. Victor Litvin was an Independent candidate, who upset some people with his unique ballot paper label.\n\n5. Miss Helen Mary Anscomb was an Independent candidate, who frequently contested by-elections in the 1980s.\n\n6. Peter Reid Smith, was another Independent candidate.\n\n\n"}

On 13 March 2010, Imedi brought forward the programme to 7:59pm, the timeslot allocated to \"Chronicle\". \"Chronicle\" which runs at 8:00pm is a major source of information for Imedi TV viewers.\nThe fake news report, which heavily utilised footage from the 2008 war in South Ossetia, began by Imedi accusing the Georgian opposition of the organisation of protests in Tbilisi due to alleged fraud in the Tbilisi city elections which were scheduled for 30 May. During the protests, unknown gunmen opened fire on the protestors, killing some. As a result, the opposition pleaded for the international community to assist in ousting the \"Saakashvili tyranny\". Following the protest in Tbilisi, an ambush in the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali occurred, which killed the President of South Ossetia Eduard Kokoity. Moscow announced that it held proof of the involvement of Georgian security services in the Kokoity assassination, which Russia deemed to be a terrorist attack. Allegedly pro-Russian opposition politicians, led by Nino Burdzhanadze and Zurab Nogaideli travelled to Tskhinval and accused Saakashvili of the killing of Kokoity. After the assassination, Russian Army troops were mobilized and put on high alert. Georgian Army troops were mobilized, and took defensive positions around Tbilisi with heavy artillery. A \"people's government\" with Burdzhanadze at the helm declared the government of Saakashvili \"illegal\". Other Georgian opposition politicians who were held up as collaborators with the Russians included Zurab Dzidziguri, Kakha Kukava, Koba Davitashvili, Levan Gachechiladze and Giorgi Khaindrava. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is shown, with a Georgian voiceover, allegedly saying “Since the Saakashvili regime began open terrorism against South Ossetia, this international criminal must be stopped. I have ordered a military operation, and call on the Georgian people not to resist the troops that bring them freedom.” The broadcast then showed Russian tanks, which were based in the Akhalgori region in South Ossetia, entering the Georgian capital, and several Georgian battalions were reported to have defected and sided with the people's government. Saakashvili is pronounced as having possibly been assassinated, which was allegedly announced by the Movement for Fair Georgia; the political party headed by former Georgian Prime Minister and current opposition politician, Zurab Nogaideli. However, other reports had stated that Saakashvili was alive in a hidden location and still in command. The broadcast stated that the West stood by and issued only \"halfhearted protests\". A speech said to have been given by President Saakashvili is shown, where he stated that Russia wanted to become an Empire, and instructed all eligible Georgians to join the military. Meanwhile, Russian planes are reported to have bombed targets all over Georgia, and Georgian volunteers are reported to be engaged in combat in Mtskheta. The report also included the scenario of the aircraft carrying Polish President Lech Kaczyński to Tbilisi being blown up, leading to the Polish President's death.\n\nDuring the broadcast, public panic was sparked in Georgia, as many Georgians did not see the disclaimer at the beginning of the broadcast, and assumed that they were watching live events. Thousands of telephone calls to emergency services were made, citizens hurried to withdraw cash from automatic teller machines, Georgian mobile phone networks crashed, and many prepared to flee Tbilisi and villages and towns near the border with South Ossetia. Some units of the Georgian Army took up defensive positions after hearing of the alleged invasion. Interfax began reporting the news in Russia of the invasion of Georgia and the assassination of Saakashvili, before David Cracknell, an employee of the Georgian government, sent a two-word text message to foreign journalists with the words \"Not true\".\n\nThree people died while watching the hoax. Gaioz Odishelidze, a 50-year-old man from Aragvispiri in the Dusheti district, suffered a fatal heart attack whilst watching the program. According to his son, Odishelidze cried out \"What the hell's going on?\", before grabbing his chest and collapsing. An ambulance rushed to the scene, but paramedics were unable to revive him. Vano Nasaridze, a 75-year-old resident of Tbilisi (and a refugee from Sukhumi), suffered a stroke whilst watching the broadcast. Nasaridze's family took him to hospital on 14 March, where he underwent surgery, but died several days later. Nasaridze's family announced their intention to sue Imedi, insisting that the program was responsible for his death. A woman whose son was serving in the Georgian Army died of a heart attack while watching the program.\n\nThe opposition in Georgia condemned the programme, which has been compared to the 1938 \"The War of the Worlds\" radio broadcast, and accused Saakashvili of involvement.\n\nNino Burdzhanadze, the leader of Democratic Movement-United Georgia opposition party, stated her belief that Saakashvili ordered the programme aired to increase anti-Russian sentiment and to tarnish the Georgian opposition. Burdzhanadze's party also announced that it will file a lawsuit against Imedi.\n\nFormer Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze condemned the programme and said that it was intimidation by the Georgian government of its own people. Shevardnadze also stated that the programme proved then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev correct in his decision not to hold discussions with Saakashvili. Catholicos Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia condemned the programme, saying it was an insult to Georgia's people and army.\n\nIn a poll run by Kviris Palitra, 63% of the 406 respondents believe that Saakashvili was involved in the preparation of the fake report, whilst 8.7% believe the President was uninvolved, with 28.3% indicating they were unsure.\n\nThe Imedi broadcast was condemned by many Georgian journalists who took part in protests at the Imedi TV building. Giorgi Udzilauri, a journalist with the Akhali Taoba newspaper noted that the programme demonstrated that propaganda has a large influence in Georgia, and went on to say that the programme was a test of public reaction towards the Georgian government's \"next violence and military adventure\", and that it appears the Government still holds such plans. Udzilauri also called Imedi a \"propaganada trumpet\" of the government, and stated his belief that those responsible should be taken to court, as creating panic is a crime against the State. Luba Eliashvili stated their belief that Imedi should be charged, however, new laws in Georgia do not provide significant penalties. Eliashvili also stated that a positive outcome of the report is that people have lost their trust in Imedi and the \"Mischists\" forever. Gia Iakobashvili, the Editor-in-Chief of presa.ge, stated their belief that all journalists should protest against Imedi, and that journalists should not participate in any Imedia programming. Giorgi Mamatsashvili, a journalist with the Asaval-Dasavali newspaper, regarded the programme as a staged show, and after hearing the alleged telephone conversation between Tsamalashvili and Arveladze, stated his belief that the programme had the intent of creating panic and to implement the Government's ideology. Mamatsashvili also said that \"Imedi has become a house of prostitution. This Government’s ideology is to fight against the Patriarch and destroy the Church.\"\n\nThe Council of the Charter of Journalistic Ethics in Georgia had a meeting on 25 March 2010, in which they discussed journalistic ethics in the Georgian media. \"Special Report\" anchor Natia Koberidze was due to attend the meeting but later withdrew. Koberidze stated that she was ready to attend the Council meeting, but due to its public format, decided to withdraw as the meeting could be used as a mean to attack her. Eter Turadze, the Council head, stated at the meeting that it was not being held to punish anyone, although sanctions could be considered if the Council felt that journalistic ethical norms were breached. Turadze also said that the stated aim of the meeting was to call upon journalists to act according to ethical norms. As a result of Koberidze's non-attendance at the meeting, the Council sent her 16 questions via email, which among other things asked her who was responsible for the fake news report being broadcast with visible warnings that it was only a simulation, and whether she had been put under any pressure. Koberidze replied to the questionnaire by saying that she did not violate the Charter, as warnings were given to viewers as the programme began that it was a simulation. She also stated she was not aware who was responsible for the absence of visible warnings during the programme.\n\nGiorgi Arveladze, the General Director of Imedi TV, stated that the purpose of the program was to demonstrate to Georgians the external threats that they were faced with, saying, \"The really unpleasant thing about yesterday's report — and I want everyone to understand this well — is that this report is as close to reality as possible, to what may really happen, and to what Georgia's enemies keep in mind\". Arveladze apologised for the panic which the broadcast caused in Georgia, but defended the report, and dismissed calls for him to resign. Whilst Arveladze refused to be drawn into questions on whether the broadcast breached the code of conduct for broadcasters, the Georgian National Communications Commission and the Young Lawyers' Association of Georgia said that Imedi had violated the code with its broadcast. The Imedi chief was also forced to defend against allegations that top officials in the Georgian government, including Saakashvili, were informed about the programme before it went to air. After a finding by the GNMC that the broadcast violated the broadcaster's code of conduct, the broadcaster was directed to make a public apology.\n\nOn 14 March 2010, speaking to residents in the Bolnisi region, Saakashvili appeared to defend the broadcast, and stated \"(i)t was indeed a very unpleasant program, but the most unpleasant thing is that it is extremely close to what can happen and to what Georgia's enemy has conceived\". The only part of the fake report that Saakashvili specifically objected to was the part which said that some of the Georgian Army had joined forces with the Russians, as it is according to Saakashvili an insult to those who are fighting for Georgia. However, during the Mukhrovani Mutiny Saakashvili called the same soldiers traitors and accused them of working for Russia. Military expert Giorgi Melitauri accused those behind the Mukhrovani Mutiny; those who carry out Saakashvili's propaganda orders; of being behind the writing of the programme. On 15 March 2010, a written statement appeared on the Georgian President's website, in which, aside from accusing Russia of having aggressive plans against Georgia, he called for higher journalistic ethical standards to prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nGeorgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri speaking in Brussels rejected the notion that the government exercised any control over Imedi, citing the station's private ownership; despite this, the station is widely perceived as being under the control of the government in Tbilisi.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, an audio recording alleged to be a telephone conversation between Arveladze and his deputy Eka Tsamalashvili was released by \"Forum.ge\"; because of Arveladze's close ties to Saakashvili this raised suspicions that the Saakashvili had been involved in the broadcast. In the recording, a woman, allegedly Tsamalashvili, says that airing the report as if it were genuine news would be a violation of the Georgian Law on Broadcasting, and stated that a notification should be carried on screen telling viewers of the fake report that it was a simulation. A man, allegedly Arveladze, responds to the suggestion by saying that he had spoken to \"Misha\" — a nickname for Saakashvili — the day previous, and after being asked by Saakashvili whether the programme would be put to air as a regular Chronicle programme, he told him that it would. The man continued to say that he told Saakashvili that viewers would be told at the beginning of the broadcast that the programme was a simulation, but Saakashvili said not to do so, ostensibly because it would affect the effect of the programme. The man goes on to say that the general plot outline had been provided to Ghia Nodia and Zurab Davitashvili, both former members of Saakashvili's government. After being asked about the plot outline, both Nodia and Davitashvili confirmed that they had received it from the television network prior to the broadcast.\n\nArveladze denied the conversation took place and accused the Russian special services of fabricating the tape by stitching together phrases from different conversations to produce the recording. Tsamalashvili called the recording \"absurd and a lie\", and dismissed suggestions that she had received directions from government officials whilst working at Imedi. She also suggested involvement of Russian special services in the alleged fabrication. Independent analyst Irakli Sesiashvili stated that the recording was \"very close\" to authentic, and stated his belief that the voices on the recording matched the alleged speakers manner of speaking. Sesiashvili also stated that it is impossible to \"maintain natural intonation and idiolect in a fabricated tape\".\n\nOn 16 March 2010, an audio recording of an alleged telephone conversation between Saakashvili and the Georgian Minister of Culture Nika Rurua was anonymously posted online, and was partially aired by Rustavi 2 in its 6pm news bulletin. In the recording, a man, allegedly Rurua calling from Paris, asks whether the panic caused by the program had \"calmed down\". In response, another man, allegedly Saakashvili, says that the panic only lasted five minutes, and that Imedi should have placed a caption below the screen to advise viewers it was a simulation. The second man then says that the programme had predicted quite accurately the \"Russian scenario\", and that he had spoken to Arveladze and told this to him. Rurua accused the Russian Federal Security Service of fabricating the recording.\n\nIrakli Sesiashvili suggested that Georgian Interior Minister Vano Merabishvili, or his ministry, which is believed to engage in illegal phone-tapping, was behind the leaking of the telephone recordings to the internet, ostensibly in an attempt to discredit Saakashvili. Irakli Alasania, the leader of Alliance for Georgia, pressed authorities to carry out expert analysis of the recordings, and also said that foreign experts should participate in verifying whether the recordings are authentic. Giorgi Targamadze, the leader of the Christian-Democratic Movement, called for an ad-hoc parliamentary commission to investigate the case, but his proposal was knocked back by lawmakers of the ruling party, who dismissed it as \"not serious\".\n\nAndrei Nesterenko, the spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Imedi program was irresponsible and immoral, and that Russia understood the anger in Georgia as a result of the airing. He also accused the government in Georgia of \"political paranoia\". Nesterenko also stated that Saakashvili's comments on the programme amounted to his approval of its contents. Dmitry Rogozin, the Permanent Representative of Russia to NATO, in an interview with Russia Today said that the programme was a grandiose provocation, and was the continuation of an information war that Saakashvili continued to wage against Russia. Sergey Markov, a member of the Russian State Duma, opined that the programme was aimed at the opposition forces in Georgia, rather than Russia. Markov also stated that hatred towards Russia was part of Saakashvili's political agenda, and that it was a priority that those who cross him by seeking contacts with Russia be discredited, whilst according to BBC News, some also saw the report as a thinly veiled swipe at Georgian opposition figures who met Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin in an attempt to mend Georgia–Russia relations. Nino Burdzhanadze met with Putin in Moscow the week before the report, and was accused of treason by parliamentary allies of Saakashvili. Russian media outlets also announced intent to sue Imedi for copyright infringement, after the Georgian station used footage without permission from the Russian copyright holders.\n\nIn calling the report irresponsible, Éric Fournier, the French ambassador to Georgia, condemned the use of his image in the fake report. Imedi used archive footage of Fournier talking to journalists, and portrayed Fournier as telling viewers of results of meetings with the Georgian Foreign Minister, where they were briefed on Russia's military operations. Archive footage of the British and Czech ambassadors were also used in the same segment. Denis Keefe, the British ambassador in Tbilisi, stated the use of archive footage of himself was a discourtesy to him as Ambassador, and that the program did a disservice to Georgia's reputation as having a responsible and independent media. Keefe also complained that the program suggested that Saakashvili had held discussions with the British Prime Minister Gordon Brown about the \"non-existent events described\", and stated that neither he, nor the British government had any involvement in or previous knowledge of, what he called, Imedi's irresponsible programme. The Ambassador also demanded that Imedi apologise and make it clear that it used his image without his consent or permission. United States Ambassador to Georgia John Bass called the broadcast irresponsible and perturbing, and said it was not helpful in improving the security situation in the region.\n\nThe European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia stated that the airing of the program was irresponsible and had the potential to further destabilise the region, with the possibility of a resumption of military actions between Russian and Georgian troops. The Mission kept in constant contact with the Russian Border Guards and the Government of South Ossetia during the broadcast via the Incident Prevention and Response Mechanism hotline to ensure that alert levels remained at the status quo. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, after a meeting with Georgian Prime Minister Nika Gilauri in Brussels, expressed his concern over the hoax news report and said the European Union is \"hopeful that intensive work will continue to consolidate democratic institutions, create an inclusive political culture, and ensure full media freedom.\" Barroso also called on the Georgian government to refrain from activities which could increase local and regional tensions.\n\nNATO spokesman James Appathurai in a briefing in Brussels on 24 March 2010 called the false news report \"unwise\" and \"useless\". Appathurai also stated that the incident had not been viewed positively within NATO, but would not affect Georgia's aspirations to enter the alliance.\n\nAbkhaz President Sergei Bagapsh called the programme \"tremendous idiocy\" and said that no attention should be paid to the contents of the program.\n\nOn 16 March 2010, \"TIME\" placed the fake report at number one of the \"Top 10 Shocking Hoaxes\", ahead of the Ashley Todd mugging hoax, balloon boy hoax, the KSJJ Ochoco Dam hoax, Sidd Finch hoax, 1938 The War of the Worlds radio hoax, Anna Anderson, Hitler Diaries hoax, Piltdown Man and the Great Stock Exchange Fraud of 1814.\n\nValeria Novodvorskaya alleged that the inclusion of the scenario of the blowing up of Lech Kaczyński's aircraft is evidence of complicity of the Russian State in the death of the Polish President in a plane crash on 10 April 2010 in Smolensk Oblast.\n"}

It was rebroadcast on April 30, 1984, and again on April 29, 1985. At the end of each broadcast of the film, a series of missing children's photographs and descriptions were displayed on the screen for viewers, and a number was given to call if a viewer had information about them. The 1985 photograph series was introduced by President Ronald Reagan in a pre-recorded message, \"...maybe your eyes can help bring them home.\" A sequel, \"Adam: His Song Continues\" followed on September 29, 1986, also starring Travanti and Williams.\n\nThe first part of the film portrays the story of the kidnapping and murder of Adam Walsh on July 27, 1981, along with the effects of this event on the marriage of John and Revé Walsh. The second part of the movie focuses on the Walsh's attempts to pass national child protection laws in the wake of Adam's murder, and the formation of awareness groups surrounding child disappearances. The film was written by Allan Leicht and directed by Michael Tuchner.\n\nFilming of the movie was conducted in and around Houston, Texas. The scenes portrayed at the Hollywood Mall of Hollywood, Florida, were filmed at the now-defunct Westwood Mall in Houston, and at the Sears which was one of its former anchor stores. The Sears store where some scenes were filmed is still standing.\n\nThe three broadcasts of \"Adam\" were followed by pictures and descriptions of missing children as of each of the respective broadcasts. A hotline was also active, to take calls regarding the children. This was ultimately credited with finding 13 of 55 children from the 1983 broadcast, including future rapper Bizzy Bone, and 19 of 51 children shown in the 1984 broadcast. As of two days after the 1985 showing, 3,522 calls had been made to the hotline, and 5 of 54 featured missing children had already been found.\n\n\n1984 Primetime Emmy Award nominations:\n\n"}

As for Arabic dailies published in the country \"Al Raya\" is among the three major newspapers along with \"Al Sharq\" and \"Al Watan\". \n\n\"Al Raya\" was launched by Gulf company for printing and publishing as a weekly newspaper on 10 December 1979. The company which was founded by Ali bin Jaber Al Thani also owns \"Gulf Times\", an English language daily. Based in Doha, \"Al Raya\" is the second Arabic newspaper published in Qatar. On 27 January 1980 \"Al Raya\" was relaunched as a daily newspaper.\n\nIn 1996 a corpus was created which included 187 articles published in \"Al Raya\". On 27 April 2012 the paper launched the mapping mangroves project.\n\nIn the early 1990s \"Al Raya\" had a circulation of 10,000 copies and was distributed in Saudi Arabia and Egypt in addition to its native Qatar. Until 1995 when the other Arabic daily, \"Al Watan\", was launched the paper enjoyed higher levels of circulation, but then lost its one-third of circulation. In 2000 \"Al Raya\" was the second best selling newspaper in Qatar with a circulation of 18,000 copies.

{"id": "862618", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=862618", "title": "Baby shower", "text": "Baby shower\n\nA baby shower is a party of gift-giving or a ceremony that had different names in different cultures. It celebrates the delivery or expected birth of a child or the transformation of a woman into a mother.\nThe term \"shower\" is often assumed to mean that the expectant mother is \"showered\" with gifts. A related custom, called a bridal shower, may have derived its name from the custom in the 19th century for the presents to be put inside a parasol, which when opened would \"shower\" the bride-to-be with gifts. Alternatively the term possibly denotes a \"first showing\" of the new baby to the wider family and circle of friends.\n\nTraditionally, baby showers are given only for the family's first child, and only women are invited, though this has changed in recent years, now allowing showers being split up for different audiences: workplace, mixed-sex, and feminist. Activities at baby showers include gift-giving and playing themed games.\n\nBaby shower games vary, sometimes including standard games such as bingo, and sometimes being pregnancy-themed, such as \"guess the mother's measurements\" or \"guess the baby\". These games help let the close friends attending the shower bond with the mother, and enable the new family to say thanks ahead of time, figuring out who is willing and able to help them with the challenges of bringing up a child.\n\nAccording to etiquette authority Miss Manners, because the party centers on gift-giving, the baby shower is typically arranged and hosted by a close friend rather than a member of the family, since it is considered rude for families to beg for gifts on behalf of their members. However, this custom varies by culture or region and in some it is expected and customary for a close female family member to host the baby shower, often the baby's maternal grandmother.\n\nWhen a baby shower is held after the birth of a baby, an invitation to attend the shower may be combined with a baby announcement. In the US, if a baby shower doesn't happen before the arrival of the baby, a sip-and-see party or other similar event can be organized after the birth.\n\nGuests bring small gifts for the expectant mother. Mothers are usually given pampering treats. Typical gifts related to babies include diapers, blankets, baby bottles, clothes, and toys. It is common to open the gifts during the party; sometimes the host will make a game of opening gifts.\n\nThe baby shower is a family's first opportunity to gather people together to help play a part in their child's life. The new parents may wish to call on people to assist in the upbringing of their child, and help educate the child over time. People around the family, who care for them, want to be involved in the child's life, and a baby shower presents an opportunity for them to give gifts and be of help, showing their love for the family. If it happens before the birth, it allows the new family to thank everyone before the stress of a new baby and lack of sleep begins.\n\nThe term \"baby shower\" is relatively new, but the celebrations and rituals associated with pregnancy and childbirth are both ancient and enduring.\n\n\nBaby showers and other social events to celebrate an impending or recent birth are popular around the world. They are often women-only social gatherings.\n\n Although these might be celebrated together, they are very different: \"seemantham\" is a religious ceremony, while \"valaikappu\" and \"poochoottal\" are purely social events much like Western baby showers. In a \"valaikappu\" or \"poochoottal\", music is played and the expectant mother is decked in traditional attire with lots of flowers and garlands made of jasmine or mogra. A swing is decorated with flowers of her choice, which she uses to sit and swing. At times, symbolic cut-outs of moons and stars are put up. The elderly ladies from the household and community shower blessings on the expectant mother and gifts are given to her.\n\nSome baby showers are directed at the future father. These may be more oriented towards drinking beer, watching sports, fishing, or playing video games. The primary nature of these gifts is diapers and/or diaper-related items. The organization of the diaper party is typically done by the friends of the father-to-be as a way of helping to prepare for the coming child. These parties may be held at local pubs/bars, a friend's house, or the soon-to-be grandfather's house. In the United Kingdom, this is called \"wetting the baby's head\", and is seen more commonly than baby showers. Wetting the baby's head is traditionally when the father celebrates the birth by having a few drinks with a group of friends.\n\nThere has been some controversy over these, with Judith Martin calling them a \"monstrous imposition\", although she was referring to the attitude of demanding gifts and not necessarily the male version of a baby shower.\n\n"}

{"id": "245878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=245878", "title": "Ephedra", "text": "Ephedra\n\nEphedra is a medicinal preparation from the plant \"Ephedra sinica\". Several additional species belonging to the genus \"Ephedra\" have traditionally been used for a variety of medicinal purposes, and are a possible candidate for the Soma plant of Indo-Iranian religion. It has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years. Native Americans and Mormon pioneers drank a tea brewed from other \"Ephedra\" species, called \"Mormon tea\" and \"Indian tea\".\nIn recent years, dietary supplements containing ephedra alkaloids have been found to be unsafe, with reports of serious side effects and ephedra-related deaths. In response to accumulating evidence of adverse effects and deaths related to ephedra, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids in 2004. The ban was challenged in court by ephedra manufacturers, but ultimately upheld in 2006 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Ephedra extracts not containing ephedrine have not been banned by the FDA and are still sold legally today.\n\nA wide variety of alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds have been identified in various species of \"ephedra\". Of the six ephedrine-type ingredients found in \"ephedra\" (at concentrations of 0.02-3.4%), the most common are ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are the sources of its stimulant and thermogenic effects. These compounds stimulate the brain, increase heart rate, constrict blood vessels (increasing blood pressure), and expand bronchial tubes (making breathing easier). Their thermogenic properties cause an increase in metabolism, as evidenced by an increase in body heat.\n\nEphedra is widely used by athletes as a performance-enhancing drug, despite a lack of evidence that it improves athletic performance. Ephedra may also be used as a precursor in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine.\n\nEphedra has been used as a weight-loss aid, sometimes in combination with aspirin and caffeine. Some studies in regulated and supervised environments have shown that ephedra is effective for marginal short-term weight loss (0.9 kg/month more than the placebo), although it was untested whether such weight loss is maintained. However, several reports have documented a number of adverse events attributable to unregulated ephedra supplements.\n\nAdverse effects of ephedra consumption may include severe skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, profuse perspiration, dehydration, itchy scalp and skin, vomiting, and hyperthermia. More serious potential side effects include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nThere are no formal requirements for standardization or quality control of dietary supplements in the United States, and the dosage of effective ingredients in supplements may vary widely from brand to brand or batch to batch. Studies of ephedra supplements have found significant discrepancies between the labeled dose and the actual amount of ephedra in the product. Significant variation in ephedrine alkaloid levels, by as much as 10-fold, was seen even from lot to lot within the same brand.\n\nEscalating concerns regarding the safety of ephedra supplements led the FDA to ban the sale of supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids (specifically ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, norephedrine, and methylephedrine) in the United States in 2004. This ban was challenged by supplement manufacturers and initially overturned, but ultimately upheld.\n\nIn 1997, in response to mounting concern over serious side effects of ephedra, the FDA proposed a ban on products containing 8 mg or more of ephedrine alkaloids and stricter labeling of low-dose ephedra supplements. The FDA also proposed that ephedra labels be required to disclose the health risks of ephedra, such as heart attack, stroke, and death.\n\nIn response, the supplement industry created a public relations group, the Ephedra Education Council, to oppose the changes, and commissioned a scientific review by a private consulting firm, which reported that ephedra was safe. The Ephedra Education Council also attempted to block publication of a study confirming wide discrepancies between the labeled potency of supplements and the actual amount of ephedra in the product.\n\nMetabolife, makers of the best-selling brand of ephedra supplement, had received over 14,000 complaints of adverse events associated with its product. These reports were not initially provided to the FDA. Co-founder of Metabolife, Michael Ellis, was sentenced in 2008 to six months in federal prison for his failure to report adverse effects from his company's products to the FDA. Senators Orrin Hatch (R. Utah) and Tom Harkin (D. Iowa), authors of the Dietary Supplements Health and Education Act, questioned the scientific basis for the FDA's proposed labeling changes and suggested that the number of problems reported were insufficient to warrant regulatory action. At the time, Senator Hatch's son was working for a firm hired to lobby Congress and the FDA on behalf of ephedra manufacturers.\n\nIn addition to the activities of the Ephedra Education Council, Metabolife spent more than $4 million between 1998 and 2000 lobbying against state regulation of ephedra in Texas. \"Business Week\" reported that efforts to regulate ephedra and other potentially harmful supplements had been \"beaten down by deep-pocketed industry lobbying.\"\n\nIn 2000, the FDA withdrew the proposed labeling changes and restrictions.\n\nA review of ephedra-related adverse reactions, published in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" in 2000, found a number of cases of sudden cardiac death or severe disability resulting from ephedra use, many of which occurred in young adults using ephedra in the labeled dosages. Subsequently, in response to pressure from the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Metabolife was compelled by the Department of Justice in 2002 to turn over reports of over 15,000 ephedra-related adverse events, ranging from insomnia to death, which the company had previously withheld from the FDA. Use of ephedra was considered to have possibly contributed to the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive lineman Korey Stringer from heatstroke in 2001.\n\nSteve Bechler, a pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, died of complications from heatstroke following a spring training workout on February 17, 2003. The medical examiner found that ephedra toxicity played a \"significant role\" in Bechler's sudden death. Following Bechler's death, the FDA re-opened its efforts to regulate ephedra use. According to Bruce Silverglade, legal director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, \"All of a sudden [after Bechler's death] Congress dropped objections to an ephedra ban and started demanding that the FDA act.\"\n\nSenator Orrin Hatch (R. Utah), who in 1999 had helped block the FDA's attempts to regulate ephedra, said in March 2003 that \"...it has been obvious to even the most casual observer that problems exist\", and called FDA action to regulate ephedra \"long overdue.\"\n\nIn response to renewed calls for the regulation of ephedra, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a large meta-analysis of ephedra's safety and efficacy by the RAND Corporation. This study found that ephedra promoted modest short-term weight loss, but there was insufficient data to determine whether it was effective for long-term weight loss or performance enhancement. The use of ephedrine alkaloids in this study was associated with significant gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autonomic side effects. Almost simultaneously, a study in \"Annals of Internal Medicine\" found that ephedrine alkaloids were 100 to 700 times more likely to cause a significant adverse reaction than other commonly used supplements such as kava or \"Ginkgo biloba\".\n\nOn December 30, 2003, the FDA issued a press release recommending that consumers stop buying and using products containing ephedrine alkaloids, and indicating its intention to ban the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing supplements. Subsequently, on April 12, 2004, the FDA issued a final rule banning the sale of ephedrine alkaloid-containing dietary supplements. Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, stated that \"...These products pose unacceptable health risks, and any consumers who are still using them should stop immediately.\" Products containing ephedra extract remain legal to this day.\n\nNutraceutical Corporation, a supplement manufacturer based in Park City, Utah, challenged the legality of the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids as exceeding the authority given the agency by the Dietary Health Supplements and Education Act. Nutraceutical Corporation stated that while they did not intend to restart marketing ephedra, they were concerned about the scope of the FDA's regulatory action. Judge Tena Campbell of the Utah Federal District Court ruled that the FDA had not proven that low doses of ephedra alkaloids were unsafe, although she also noted that studies to address the safety of low-dose ephedra would be unethical. Nevertheless, her ruling overturned the ban on the sale of ephedra alkaloids in the state of Utah, and called into question whether the ban could be enforced anywhere in the United States.\n\nThe ruling was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page administrative record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined to hear this petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloid-containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.\n\nEphedrine is listed as a banned substance by both the International Olympic Committee and the World Anti-Doping Agency. The National Football League banned players from using ephedra as a dietary supplement in 2001 after the death of Minnesota Vikings offensive tackle Korey Stringer; ephedra was found in Stringer's locker and lawyers for the team contended that it contributed to his death. The substance is also banned by the National Basketball Association. Nonetheless, ephedra remains widely used by athletes; a 2006 survey of collegiate hockey players found that nearly half had used ephedra believing it enhanced their athletic performance.\n\nIn the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the Argentine footballer Diego Armando Maradona tested positive for ephedrine. The Japanese motorcycle racer Noriyuki Haga tested positive for ephedrine in 2000, being disqualified from two races and banned from two more as a result. NFL punter Todd Sauerbrun of the Denver Broncos was suspended for the first month of the 2006 season after testing positive for ephedrine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "385405", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=385405", "title": "Flyting", "text": "Flyting\n\nFlyting or fliting is a contest consisting of the exchange of insults, often conducted in verse, between two parties.\n\nFlyting is a ritual, poetic exchange of insults practised mainly between the 5th and 16th centuries. The root is the Old English word meaning quarrel. Examples of flyting are found throughout Norse, Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Medieval literature involving both historical and mythological figures. The exchanges would become extremely provocative, often involving accusations of cowardice or sexual perversion.\n\nNorse literature contains stories of the gods flyting. For example, in \"Lokasenna\" the god Loki insults the other gods in the hall of Ægir and the poem \"Hárbarðsljóð\" in which Hárbarðr (generally considered to be Odin in disguise) engages in flyting with Thor.\n\nIn the confrontation of Beowulf and Unferð in the poem \"Beowulf\", flytings were used as either a prelude to battle or as a form of combat in their own right.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, flyting would take place in a feasting hall. The winner would be decided by the reactions of those watching the exchange. The winner would drink a large cup of beer or mead in victory, then invite the loser to drink as well.\n\nThe 13th century poem \"The Owl and the Nightingale\" and Geoffrey Chaucer's \"Parlement of Foules\" contain elements of flyting.\n\nFlyting became public entertainment in Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries, when makars would engage in verbal contests of provocative, often sexual and scatological but highly poetic abuse. Flyting was permitted despite the fact that the penalty for profanities in public was a fine of 20 shillings (over £300 in 2018 prices) for a lord, or a whipping for a servant. James IV and James V encouraged \"court flyting\" between poets for their entertainment and occasionally engaged with them. \"The Flyting of Dumbar and Kennedie\" records a contest between William Dunbar and Walter Kennedy in front of James IV, which includes the earliest recorded use of the word shit as a personal insult. In 1536 the poet Sir David Lyndsay composed a ribald 60-line flyte to James V after the King demanded a response to a flyte.\n\nFlytings appear in several of William Shakespeare's plays. Margaret Galway analysed 13 comic flytings and several other ritual exchanges in the tragedies. Flytings also appear in Nicholas Udall's \"Ralph Roister Doister\" and John Still's \"Gammer Gurton's Needle\" from the same era.\n\nWhile flyting died out in Scottish writing after the Middle Ages, it continued for writers of Celtic background. Robert Burns parodied flyting in his poem, \"To a Louse,\" and James Joyce's poem \"The Holy Office\" is a curse upon society by a bard. Joyce played with the traditional two-character exchange by making one of the characters society as a whole.\n\nIn modern portrayals, the climactic scene in Rick Riordan's novel \"The Ship of the Dead\" consists of a flyting between the protagonist Magnus Chase and the Norse god Loki.\n\nHilary Mackie has detected in the \"Iliad\" a consistent differentiation between representations in Greek of Achaean and Trojan speech, where Achaeans repeatedly engage in public, ritualized abuse: \"Achaeans are proficient at blame, while Trojans perform praise poetry.\"\n\nTaunting songs are present in the Inuit culture, among many others. Flyting can also be found in Arabic poetry in a popular form called \"naqā’iḍ\", as well as the competitive verses of Japanese Haikai.\n\nEchoes of the genre continue into modern poetry. Hugh MacDiarmid's poem \"A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle\", for example, has many passages of flyting in which the poet's opponent is, in effect, the rest of humanity.\n\nFlyting is similar in both form and function to the modern practice of freestyle battles between rappers and the historic practice of the Dozens, a verbal-combat game representing a synthesis of flyting and its Early Modern English descendants with comparable African verbal-combat games such as \"Ikocha Nkocha\".\n\nIn Finnic Kalevala the hero Väinämöinen uses similar practice of \"kilpalaulanta\" (duel singing) to win opposing Joukahainen.\n\nIn a May 2010 episode of the Channel 4 series \"Time Team\", archaeologists Matt Williams and Phil Harding engage in some mock flyting in Old English written by Saxon historian Sam Newton to demonstrate the practice. For example, \"Mattaeus, ic þé onsecge þæt þín scofl is nú unscearp æfter géara ungebótes\" (\"Matthew, I to thee say that thine shovel is now blunt after years of misuse\").\n\n\n"}

{"id": "5043324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5043324", "title": "Iraq War", "text": "Iraq War\n\nThe Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began in 2003 with the invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition that overthrew the government of Saddam Hussein. The conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 3–4 years of conflict. The U.S. became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue. The invasion occurred as part of a declared war against international terrorism and its sponsors under the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush following the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe invasion began on 20 March 2003, with the U.S., joined by the United Kingdom and several coalition allies, launching a \"shock and awe\" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed by a military court three years later. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's demise and the mismanagement of the occupation led to widespread sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against U.S. and coalition forces. Many violent insurgent groups were supported by Iran and al-Qaeda in Iraq. The United States responded with a troop surge in 2007. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President Barack Obama. The U.S. formally withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by December 2011.\n\nThe Bush administration based its rationale for the war principally on the assertion that Iraq, which had been viewed by the U.S. as a rogue state since the 1990-1991 Gulf War, possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and that the Iraqi government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies. Select U.S. officials accused Saddam of harbouring and supporting al-Qaeda, while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq. After the invasion, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs, while claims of Iraqi officials collaborating with al-Qaeda were proven false. The rationale and misrepresentation of U.S. prewar intelligence faced heavy criticism both domestically and internationally, with President Bush declining from his record-high approval ratings following 9/11 to become one of the most unpopular presidents in U.S. history. From 2009-2011, the UK conducted a broad inquiry into its decision to go to war chaired by Sir John Chilcot. The Chilcot Report, published in 2016, concluded military action may have been necessary but was not the last resort at the time and that the consequences of invasion were underestimated.\n\nIn the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held multi-party elections in 2005. Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's Sunni minority and worsening sectarian tensions. In the summer of 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a military offensive in Northern Iraq and declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate, eliciting another military response from the United States and its allies. The Iraq War caused over a hundred thousand civilian deaths and tens of thousands of military deaths (see estimates below). The majority of deaths occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.\n\nStrong international opposition to the Saddam Hussein regime began after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The international community condemned the invasion, and in 1991 a military coalition led by the United States launched the Gulf War to expel Iraq from Kuwait. Following the Gulf War, the US and its allies tried to keep Saddam in check with a policy of containment. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the US and the UK to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shias in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections to ensure Iraq's compliance with United Nations resolutions concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe inspections were carried out by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM). UNSCOM, in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, worked to ensure that Iraq destroyed its chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons and facilities. In the decade following the Gulf War, the United Nations passed 16 Security Council resolutions calling for the complete elimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction. Member states communicated their frustration over the years that Iraq was impeding the work of the special commission and failing to take seriously its disarmament obligations. Iraqi officials harassed the inspectors and obstructed their work, and in August 1998 the Iraqi government suspended cooperation with the inspectors completely, alleging that the inspectors were spying for the US. The spying allegations were later substantiated.\n\nIn October 1998, removing the Iraqi government became official U.S. foreign policy with enactment of the Iraq Liberation Act. The act provided $97 million for Iraqi \"democratic opposition organizations\" to \"establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq.\" This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change. One month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the US and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called Operation Desert Fox. The campaign's express rationale was to hamper Saddam Hussein's government's ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but U.S. intelligence personnel also hoped it would help weaken Saddam's grip on power.\n\nWith the election of George W. Bush as president in 2000, the US moved towards a more aggressive Iraq policy. The Republican Party's campaign platform in the 2000 election called for \"full implementation\" of the Iraq Liberation Act as \"a starting point\" in a plan to \"remove\" Saddam. However, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the 11 September attacks.\n\n After 9/11 , the Bush Administration national security team actively debated an invasion of Iraq. On the day of the attacks, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld asked his aides for: \"best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at same time. Not only Osama bin Laden.\" President Bush spoke with Rumsfeld on 21 November and instructed him to conduct a confidential review of OPLAN 1003, the war plan for invading Iraq. Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks, the commander of U.S. Central Command, on 27 November to go over the plans. A record of the meeting includes the question \"How start?\", listing multiple possible justifications for a U.S.–Iraq War. The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been widely questioned, as there was no cooperation between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.\n\nBush began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq in his 12 September 2002 address to the UN Security Council. Key U.S. allies in NATO, such as the United Kingdom, agreed with the US actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised \"serious consequences\" for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government. The US and UK ambassadors to the UN publicly confirmed this reading of the resolution.\n\nResolution 1441 set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency. Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA \"found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq\"; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses. In March 2003, Blix said progress had been made in inspections, and no evidence of WMD had been found.\n\nIn October 2002, the US Congress passed the \"Iraq Resolution\". The resolution authorized the President to \"use any means necessary\" against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush's plan (see popular opinion in the United States on the invasion of Iraq). The US government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.\nOn 5 February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN to present evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons. However, Powell's presentation included information based on the claims of Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed \"Curveball\", an Iraqi emigrant living in Germany who later admitted that his claims had been false. Powell also presented evidence alleging Iraq had ties to al-Qaeda. As a follow-up to Powell's presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but NATO members like Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy. Facing a losing vote as well as a likely veto from France and Russia, the US, UK, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Australia eventually withdrew their resolution.\nIn March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq with a host of public relations and military moves. In an address to the nation on 17 March 2003, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.\n\nThe UK House of Commons held a debate on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149. The vote was a key moment in the history of the Blair administration, as the number of government MPs who rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, John Denham, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and the then Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook.\n\nIn October 2002, former U.S. President Bill Clinton warned about possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq. Speaking in the UK at a Labour Party conference he said: \"As a preemptive action today, however well-justified, may come back with unwelcome consequences in the future... I don't care how precise your bombs and your weapons are, when you set them off, innocent people will die.\" The majority of Democrats in Congress voted against the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002, although a majority of Democrats in the Senate voted in favor of it. Sen. Jim Webb wrote shortly before the vote, \"Those who are pushing for a unilateral war in Iraq know full well that there is no exit strategy if we invade.\"\n\nIn the same period, Pope John Paul II publicly condemned the military intervention. During a private meeting, he also said directly to George W. Bush: \"Mr. President, you know my opinion about the war in Iraq. Let's talk about something else. Every violence, against one or a million, is a blasphemy addressed to the image and likeness of God.\"\nOn 20 January 2003, French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin declared \"we believe that military intervention would be the worst solution\". Meanwhile, anti-war groups across the world organised public protests. According to French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with demonstrations on 15 February 2003 being the largest. Nelson Mandela voiced his opposition in late January, stating \"All that (Mr. Bush) wants is Iraqi oil,\" and questioning if Bush deliberately undermined the U.N. \"because the secretary-general of the United Nations [was] a black man\".\n\nIn February 2003, the US Army's top general, Eric Shinseki, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it would take \"several hundred thousand soldiers\" to secure Iraq. Two days later, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said the post-war troop commitment would be less than the number of troops required to win the war, and that \"the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U.S. forces is far from the mark.\" Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Shinseki's estimate was \"way off the mark,\" because other countries would take part in an occupying force.\n\nGermany's Foreign Secretary Joschka Fischer, although having been in favour of stationing German troops in Afghanistan, advised Federal Chancellor Schröder not to join the war in Iraq. Fischer famously confronted United States Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at the 39th Munich Security Conference in 2003 on the secretary's purported evidence for Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction: \"Excuse me, I am not convinced!\"\n\nThere were serious legal questions surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the Bush Doctrine of preemptive war in general. On 16 September 2004, Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, said of the invasion, \"I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view, from the Charter point of view, it was illegal.\"\n\nIn November 2008 Lord Bingham, the former British Law Lord, described the war as a serious violation of international law, and accused Britain and the United States of acting like a \"world vigilante\". He also criticized the post-invasion record of Britain as \"an occupying power in Iraq\". Regarding the treatment of Iraqi detainees in Abu Ghraib, Bingham said: \"Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the Bush administration.\" In July 2010, Deputy Prime Minister of the UK Nick Clegg, in an official PMQs session in Parliament, condemned the invasion of Iraq as illegal.\n\nThe first Central Intelligence Agency team entered Iraq on 10 July 2002. This team was composed of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division and was later joined by members of the US military's elite Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC). Together, they prepared for the invasion of conventional forces. These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi military divisions to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and identifying all the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions.\n\nMost importantly, their efforts organized the Kurdish Peshmerga to become the northern front of the invasion. Together this force defeated Ansar al-Islam in Iraqi Kurdistan before the invasion and then defeated the Iraqi army in the north. The battle against Ansar al-Islam, known as Operation Viking Hammer, led to the death of a substantial number of militants and the uncovering of a chemical weapons facility at Sargat.\n\nAt 5:34 a.m. Baghdad time on 20 March 2003 (9:34 pm, 19 March EST) the surprise military invasion of Iraq began. There was no declaration of war. The 2003 invasion of Iraq, led by U.S. Army General Tommy Franks, under the code-name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\", the UK code-name Operation Telic, and the Australian code-name Operation Falconer. Coalition forces also cooperated with Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north. Approximately forty other governments, the \"Coalition of the Willing,\" participated by providing troops, equipment, services, security, and special forces, with 248,000 soldiers from the United States, 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers and 194 Polish soldiers from Special Forces unit GROM sent to Kuwait for the invasion. The invasion force was also supported by Iraqi Kurdish militia troops, estimated to number upwards of 70,000.\nAccording to General Tommy Franks, there were eight objectives of the invasion, \"First, ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate, and eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture, and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can relate to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can relate to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq's oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government.\"\nThe invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the U.S., British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular war at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes.\n\nCoalition troops launched air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula to secure the oil fields there and the important ports, supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy. The United States Marine Corps' 15th  Marine Expeditionary Unit, attached to 3 Commando Brigade and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attacked the port of Umm Qasr, while the British Army's 16 Air Assault Brigade secured the oil fields in southern Iraq.\n\nThe heavy armor of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved more easterly along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and 1 (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland. The U.S. 1st Marine Division fought through Nasiriyah in a battle to seize the major road junction. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around Talil Airfield.\n\nWith the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured in its rear, the 3rd Infantry Division supported by the 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north toward Najaf and Karbala, but a severe sand storm slowed the coalition advance and there was a halt to consolidate and make sure the supply lines were secure. When they started again they secured the Karbala Gap, a key approach to Baghdad, then secured the bridges over the Euphrates River, and U.S. forces poured through the gap on to Baghdad. In the middle of Iraq, the 1st Marine Division fought its way to the eastern side of Baghdad, and prepared for the attack into Baghdad to seize it.\n\nOn 9 April, Baghdad fell, ending Saddam's 24‑year rule. U.S. forces seized the deserted Ba'ath Party ministries and, according to some reports later disputed by the Marines on the ground, stage-managed the tearing down of a huge iron statue of Saddam, photos and video of which became symbolic of the event, although later controversial. Allegedly, though not seen in the photos or heard on the videos, shot with a zoom lens, was the chant of the inflamed crowd for Muqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric. The abrupt fall of Baghdad was accompanied by a widespread outpouring of gratitude toward the invaders, but also massive civil disorder, including the looting of public and government buildings and drastically increased crime.\n\nAccording to the Pentagon, (of total) of ordnance was looted, providing a significant source of ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency. The invasion phase concluded when Tikrit, Saddam's home town, fell with little resistance to the U.S. Marines of Task Force Tripoli.\n\nIn the invasion phase of the war (19 March – 30 April), an estimated 9,200 Iraqi combatants were killed by coalition forces along with an estimated 3,750 non-combatants, i.e. civilians who did not take up arms. Coalition forces reported the death in combat of 139 U.S. military personnel and 33 UK military personnel.\n\nOn 1 May 2003, President Bush visited the aircraft carrier USS \"Abraham Lincoln\" operating a few miles west of San Diego, California. At sunset, he held his nationally televised \"Mission Accomplished\" speech\", delivered before the sailors and airmen on the flight deck: Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq, due to the defeat of Iraq's conventional forces, while still maintaining that much still needed to be done.\n\nNevertheless, Saddam Hussein remained at large, and significant pockets of resistance remained. After Bush's speech, coalition forces noticed a flurry of attacks on its troops began to gradually increase in various regions, such as the \"Sunni Triangle\". The initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and Republican Guard.\n\nInitially, Iraqi resistance (described by the coalition as \"Anti-Iraqi Forces\") largely stemmed from fedayeen and Saddam/Ba'ath Party loyalists, but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The three provinces with the highest number of attacks were Baghdad, Al Anbar, and Salah Ad Din. Those three provinces account for 35% of the population, but by December 2006 they were responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%).\n\nInsurgents used various guerrilla tactics, including mortars, missiles, suicide attacks, snipers, improvised explosive devices (IEDs), car bombs, small arms fire (usually with assault rifles), and RPGs (rocket propelled grenades), as well as sabotage against the petroleum, water, and electrical infrastructures.\n\nCoalition efforts to establish post-invasion Iraq commenced after the fall of Saddam's regime. The coalition nations, together with the United Nations, began to work to establish a stable, compliant democratic state capable of defending itself from non-coalition forces, as well as overcoming internal divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, coalition military forces launched several operations around the Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward late-2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the \"Ramadan Offensive\", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\n\nTo counter this offensive, coalition forces began to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion, by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam's birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma, were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.\n\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA; ), based in the Green Zone, as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 (22 May 2003) and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.\n\nThe CPA was originally headed by Jay Garner, a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted only until 11 May 2003, when President Bush appointed L. Paul Bremer. On 16 May 2003, his first day on the job, Paul Bremer issued Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1 to exclude from the new Iraqi government and administration members of the Baathist party. This policy, known as De-Ba'athification, eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their job, including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to keep their jobs. U.S. army general Sanchez called the decision a \"catastrophic failure\". Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.\n\nIn May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, Walter B. Slocombe advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased. At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Despite advice from US Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the U.S. policy. Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy. Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq. The week after, five U.S. soldiers were killed. Then, on June 18, 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad, who were throwing rocks at coalition forces. The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.\nAnother group created by the multinational force in Iraq post-invasion was the 1,400-member international Iraq Survey Group, who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. In 2004, the ISG's Duelfer Report stated that Iraq did not have a viable WMD program. \n\nIn summer 2003, the multinational forces focused on capturing the remaining leaders of the former government. On 22 July, a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20 killed Saddam's sons (Uday and Qusay) along with one of his grandsons. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\n\nMost significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003, on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn. The operation was conducted by the United States Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121. Intelligence on Saddam's whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards.\n\nWith the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.\n\nShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an Iraqi Interim Government. Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time. The insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad (Sadr City) to Basra in the south.\n\nThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganised during this time, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive. However, violence did increase during the Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004 with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as al-Qaeda in Iraq (an affiliated al-Qaeda group), led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi helping to drive the insurgency.\n\nAs the insurgency grew there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\nThe most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a Blackwater USA convoy led by four U.S. private military contractors who were providing security for food caterers Eurest Support Services. The four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Subsequently, their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people, beaten, set ablaze, and their burned corpses hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates.\nPhotos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States, and prompting an unsuccessful \"pacification\" of the city: the First Battle of Fallujah in April 2004.\n\nThe offensive was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war: the Second Battle of Fallujah, described by the U.S. military as \"the heaviest urban combat (that they had been involved in) since the battle of Hue City in Vietnam.\" During the assault, U.S. forces used white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel, attracting controversy. The 46‑day battle resulted in a victory for the coalition, with 95 U.S. soldiers killed along with approximately 1,350 insurgents. Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting, though civilian casualties were low, as they had mostly fled before the battle.\n\nAnother major event of that year was the revelation of widespread prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib, which received international media attention in April 2004. First reports of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse, as well as graphic pictures showing U.S. military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners, came to public attention from a \"60 Minutes II\" news report (28 April) and a Seymour M. Hersh article in \"The New Yorker\" (posted online on 30 April.) Military correspondent Thomas Ricks claimed that these revelations dealt a blow to the moral justifications for the occupation in the eyes of many people, especially Iraqis, and was a turning point in the war.\n\n2004 also marked the beginning of Military Transition Teams in Iraq, which were teams of U.S. military advisors assigned directly to New Iraqi Army units.\n\nOn 31 January, Iraqis elected the Iraqi Transitional Government in order to draft a permanent constitution. Although some violence and a widespread Sunni boycott marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.\n\nThe Battle of Abu Ghraib on 2 April 2005 was an attack on United States forces at Abu Ghraib prison, which consisted of heavy mortar and rocket fire, under which an estimated 80–120 armed insurgents attacked with grenades, small arms, and two vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIED). The U.S. force's munitions ran so low that orders to fix bayonets were given in preparation for hand-to-hand fighting. It was considered to be the largest coordinated assault on a U.S. base since the Vietnam War.\n\nHopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed in May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.\n\nThe summer of 2005 saw fighting around Baghdad and at Tall Afar in northwestern Iraq as U.S. forces tried to seal off the Syrian border. This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the Euphrates valley between the capital and that border.\n\nA referendum was held on 15 October in which the new Iraqi constitution was ratified. An Iraqi National Assembly was elected in December, with participation from the Sunnis as well as the Kurds and Shia.\n\nInsurgent attacks increased in 2005 with 34,131 recorded incidents, compared to a total 26,496 for the previous year.\n\nThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the al-Askari Mosque bombing in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on 22 February 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.\n\nAlthough no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on 23 February, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack the U.S. military calculated that the average homicide rate in Baghdad tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a \"civil war-like situation\".\n\nOn 12 March, five United States Army soldiers of the 502nd Infantry Regiment raped the 15-year-old Iraqi girl Abeer Qassim Hamza al-Janabi, and then murdered her, her father, her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen and her six-year-old sister Hadeel Qassim Hamza al-Janabi. The soldiers then set fire to the girl's body to conceal evidence of the crime. Four of the soldiers were convicted of rape and murder and the fifth was convicted of lesser crimes for their involvement in the events, which became known as the Mahmudiyah rape and killings.\nOn 6 June 2006, the United States was successful in tracking Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq who was killed in a targeted killing, while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately north of Baqubah. Having been tracked by a British UAV, radio contact was made between the controller and two United States Air Force F-16C jets, which identified the house and at 14:15 GMT, the lead jet dropped two 500‑pound (230 kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided GBU‑12 and GPS-guided GBU‑38 on the building where he was located. Six others—three male and three female individuals—were also reported killed. Among those killed were one of his wives and their child.\n\nThe government of Iraq took office on 20 May 2006, following approval by the members of the Iraqi National Assembly. This followed the general election in December 2005. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government, which had continued in office in a caretaker capacity until the formation of the permanent government.\n\nThe Iraq Study Group Report was released on 6 December 2006. The Iraq Study Group, made up of people from both of the major U.S. parties, was led by co-chairs James Baker, a former Secretary of State (Republican), and Lee H. Hamilton, a former U.S. Representative (Democrat). It concluded that \"the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating\" and \"U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end.\" The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On 18 December, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 attacks per week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005.\n\nCoalition forces formally transferred control of a province to the Iraqi government, the first since the war. Military prosecutors charged eight U.S. Marines with the murders of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in November 2005, 10 of them women and children. Four officers were also charged with dereliction of duty in relation to the event.\n\nSaddam Hussein was hanged on 30 December 2006, after being found guilty of crimes against humanity by an Iraqi court after a year-long trial.\n\nIn a 10 January 2007, televised address to the U.S. public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2 billion for these programs. On 23 January 2007, in the 2007 State of the Union Address, Bush announced \"deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq\".\n\nOn 10 February 2007, David Petraeus was made commander of Multi-National Force – Iraq (MNF-I), the four-star post that oversees all coalition forces in country, replacing General George Casey. In his new position, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq and employed them in the new \"Surge\" strategy outlined by the Bush administration.\n\nOn 10 May 2007, 144 Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal. On 3 June 2007, the Iraqi Parliament voted 85 to 59 to require the Iraqi government to consult with Parliament before requesting additional extensions of the UN Security Council Mandate for Coalition operations in Iraq. Despite this, the mandate was renewed on 18 December 2007, without the approval of the Iraqi parliament.\n\nPressures on U.S. troops were compounded by the continuing withdrawal of coalition forces. In early 2007, British Prime Minister Blair announced that following Operation Sinbad British troops would begin to withdraw from Basra Governorate, handing security over to the Iraqis. In July Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen also announced the withdrawal of 441 Danish troops from Iraq, leaving only a unit of nine soldiers manning four observational helicopters.\n\nIn a speech made to Congress on 10 September 2007, Petraeus \"envisioned the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent [in September].\" On 13 September, Bush backed a limited withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Bush said 5,700 personnel would be home by Christmas 2007, and expected thousands more to return by July 2008. The plan would take troop numbers back to their level before the surge at the beginning of 2007.\n\nBy March 2008, violence in Iraq was reported curtailed by 40–80%, according to a Pentagon report. Independent reports raised questions about those assessments. An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks. \"The New York Times\" counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28‑day period, based on initial daily reports from Iraqi Interior Ministry and hospital officials.\n\nHistorically, the daily counts tallied by \"The New York Times\" have underestimated the total death toll by 50% or more when compared to studies by the United Nations, which rely upon figures from the Iraqi Health Ministry and morgue figures.\n\nThe rate of U.S. combat deaths in Baghdad nearly doubled to 3.14 per day in the first seven weeks of the \"surge\" in security activity, compared to previous period. Across the rest of Iraq it decreased slightly.\n\nOn 14 August 2007, the deadliest single attack of the whole war occurred. Nearly 800 civilians were killed by a series of coordinated suicide bomb attacks on the northern Iraqi settlement of Kahtaniya. More than 100 homes and shops were destroyed in the blasts. U.S. officials blamed al‑Qaeda. The targeted villagers belonged to the non-Muslim Yazidi ethnic minority. The attack may have represented the latest in a feud that erupted earlier that year when members of the Yazidi community stoned to death a teenage girl called Du'a Khalil Aswad accused of dating a Sunni Arab man and converting to Islam. The killing of the girl was recorded on camera-mobiles and the video was uploaded onto the internet.\n\nOn 13 September 2007, Abdul Sattar Abu Risha was killed in a bomb attack in the city of Ramadi. He was an important U.S. ally because he led the \"Anbar Awakening\", an alliance of Sunni Arab tribes that opposed al-Qaeda. The latter organisation claimed responsibility for the attack. A statement posted on the Internet by the shadowy Islamic State of Iraq called Abu Risha \"one of the dogs of Bush\" and described Thursday's killing as a \"heroic operation that took over a month to prepare\".\n\nThere was a reported trend of decreasing U.S. troop deaths after May 2007, and violence against coalition troops had fallen to the \"lowest levels since the first year of the American invasion\". These, and several other positive developments, were attributed to the surge by many analysts.\n\nData from the Pentagon and other U.S. agencies such as the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that daily attacks against civilians in Iraq remained \"about the same\" since February. The GAO also stated that there was no discernible trend in sectarian violence. However, this report ran counter to reports to Congress, which showed a general downward trend in civilian deaths and ethno-sectarian violence since December 2006. By late 2007, as the U.S. troop surge began to wind down, violence in Iraq had begun to decrease from its 2006 highs.\n\nEntire neighborhoods in Baghdad were ethnically cleansed by Shia and Sunni militias and sectarian violence has broken out in every Iraqi city where there is a mixed population.\nInvestigative reporter Bob Woodward cites U.S. government sources according to which the U.S. \"surge\" was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007–08. Instead, according to that view, the reduction of violence was due to newer covert techniques by U.S. military and intelligence officials to find, target and kill insurgents, including working closely with former insurgents.\n\nIn the Shia region near Basra, British forces turned over security for the region to Iraqi Security Forces. Basra is the ninth province of Iraq's 18 provinces to be returned to local security forces' control since the beginning of the occupation.\n\nMore than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time. 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008. It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces. The UN Security Council mandate for U.S.‑led forces in Iraq will terminate \"if requested by the government of Iraq.\" Under Iraqi law, the speaker must present a resolution called for by a majority of lawmakers. 59% of those polled in the U.S. support a timetable for withdrawal.\n\nIn mid-2007, the Coalition began a controversial program to recruit Iraqi Sunnis (often former insurgents) for the formation of \"Guardian\" militias. These Guardian militias are intended to support and secure various Sunni neighborhoods against the Islamists.\n\nIn 2007, tensions increased greatly between Iran and Iraqi Kurdistan due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan (PEJAK.) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since 16 August. These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on 23 August by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants.\n\nCoalition forces also began to target alleged Iranian Quds force operatives in Iraq, either arresting or killing suspected members. The Bush administration and coalition leaders began to publicly state that Iran was supplying weapons, particularly EFP devices, to Iraqi insurgents and militias although to date have failed to provide any proof for these allegations. Further sanctions on Iranian organizations were also announced by the Bush administration in the autumn of 2007. On 21 November 2007, Lieutenant General James Dubik, who is in charge of training Iraqi security forces, praised Iran for its \"contribution to the reduction of violence\" in Iraq by upholding its pledge to stop the flow of weapons, explosives and training of extremists in Iraq.\n\nBorder incursions by PKK militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides. In the fall of 2007, the Turkish military stated their right to cross the Iraqi Kurdistan border in \"hot pursuit\" of PKK militants and began shelling Kurdish areas in Iraq and attacking PKK bases in the Mount Cudi region with aircraft.\nThe Turkish parliament approved a resolution permitting the military to pursue the PKK in Iraqi Kurdistan. In November, Turkish gunships attacked parts of northern Iraq in the first such attack by Turkish aircraft since the border tensions escalated. Another series of attacks in mid-December hit PKK targets in the Qandil, Zap, Avashin and Hakurk regions. The latest series of attacks involved at least 50 aircraft and artillery and Kurdish officials reported one civilian killed and two wounded.\n\nAdditionally, weapons that were given to Iraqi security forces by the U.S. military were being recovered by authorities in Turkey after being used by PKK in that state.\n\nOn 17 September 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the U.S. security firm Blackwater USA over the firm's involvement in the killing of eight civilians, including a woman and an infant, in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade.\n\nThroughout 2008, U.S. officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics. According to the U.S. Defense Department, in December 2008 the \"overall level of violence\" in the country had dropped 80% since before the surge began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to prewar levels. They also pointed out that the casualty figure for U.S. forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007.\n\nAccording to the Brookings Institution, Iraqi civilian fatalities numbered 490 in November 2008 as against 3,500 in January 2007, whereas attacks against the coalition numbered somewhere between 200 and 300 per week in the latter half of 2008, as opposed to a peak of nearly 1,600 in summer 2007. The number of Iraqi security forces killed was under 100 per month in the second half of 2008, from a high of 200 to 300 in summer 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, the proficiency of the Iraqi military increased as it launched a spring offensive against Shia militias, which Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had previously been criticized for allowing to operate. This began with a March operation against the Mehdi Army in Basra, which led to fighting in Shia areas up and down the country, especially in the Sadr City district of Baghdad. By October, the British officer in charge of Basra said that since the operation the town had become \"secure\" and had a murder rate comparable to Manchester in England. The U.S. military also said there had been a decrease of about a quarter in the quantity of Iranian-made explosives found in Iraq in 2008, possibly indicating a change in Iranian policy.\n\nProgress in Sunni areas continued after members of the Awakening movement were transferred from U.S. military to Iraqi control. In May, the Iraqi army – backed by coalition support – launched an offensive in Mosul, the last major Iraqi stronghold of al-Qaeda. Despite detaining thousands of individuals, the offensive failed to lead to major long-term security improvements in Mosul. At the end of the year, the city remained a major flashpoint.\nIn the regional dimension, the ongoing conflict between Turkey and PKK intensified on 21 February, when Turkey launched a ground attack into the Quandeel Mountains of Northern Iraq. In the nine-day-long operation, around 10,000 Turkish troops advanced up to 25 km into Northern Iraq. This was the first substantial ground incursion by Turkish forces since 1995.\n\nShortly after the incursion began, both the Iraqi cabinet and the Kurdistan regional government condemned Turkey's actions and called for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region. Turkish troops withdrew on 29 February. The fate of the Kurds and the future of the ethnically diverse city of Kirkuk remained a contentious issue in Iraqi politics.\n\nU.S. military officials met these trends with cautious optimism as they approached what they described as the \"transition\" embodied in the U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement, which was negotiated throughout 2008. The commander of the coalition, U.S. General Raymond T. Odierno, noted that \"in military terms, transitions are the most dangerous time\" in December 2008.\n\nAt the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed \"Charge of the Knights\", in Basra to secure the area from militias. This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops. The offensive was opposed by the Mahdi Army, one of the militias, which controlled much of the region. Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including Sadr City, Al Kut, Al Hillah and others. During the fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance from militiamen in Basra to the point that the Iraqi military offensive slowed to a crawl, with the high attrition rates finally forcing the Sadrists to the negotiating table.\n\nFollowing talks with Brig. Gen. Qassem Suleimani, commander of the Qods brigades of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, and the intercession of the Iranian government, on 31 March 2008, al‑Sadr ordered his followers to ceasefire. The militiamen kept their weapons.\n\nBy 12 May 2008, Basra \"residents overwhelmingly reported a substantial improvement in their everyday lives\" according to \"The New York Times\". \"Government forces have now taken over Islamic militants' headquarters and halted the death squads and 'vice enforcers' who attacked women, Christians, musicians, alcohol sellers and anyone suspected of collaborating with Westerners\", according to the report; however, when asked how long it would take for lawlessness to resume if the Iraqi army left, one resident replied, \"one day\".\n\nIn late April roadside bombings continued to rise from a low in January—from 114 bombings to more than 250, surpassing the May 2007 high.\n\nSpeaking before the Congress on 8 April 2008, General David Petraeus urged delaying troop withdrawals, saying, \"I've repeatedly noted that we haven't turned any corners, we haven't seen any lights at the end of the tunnel,\" referencing the comments of then President Bush and former Vietnam-era General William Westmoreland. When asked by the Senate if reasonable people could disagree on the way forward, Petraeus said, \"We fight for the right of people to have other opinions.\"\n\nUpon questioning by then Senate committee chair Joe Biden, Ambassador Crocker admitted that Al‑Qaeda in Iraq was less important than the Al Qaeda organization led by Osama bin Laden along the Afghan-Pakistani border. Lawmakers from both parties complained that U.S. taxpayers are carrying Iraq's burden as it earns billions of dollars in oil revenues.\n\nIraq became one of the top purchasers of U.S. military equipment with their army trading its AK‑47 assault rifles for the U.S. M‑16 and M‑4 rifles, among other equipment. In 2008 alone, Iraq accounted for more than of the U.S. weapon sales to foreign countries (not including the potential F-16 fighter planes.).\n\nIraq sought 36 F‑16s, the most sophisticated weapons system Iraq has attempted to purchase. The Pentagon notified Congress that it had approved the sale of 24 American attack helicopters to Iraq, valued at as much as $2.4 billion. Including the helicopters, Iraq announced plans to purchase at least in U.S. tanks and armored vehicles, transport planes and other battlefield equipment and services. Over the summer, the Defense Department announced that the Iraqi government wanted to order more than 400 armored vehicles and other equipment worth up to , and six C-130J transport planes, worth up to . From 2005 to 2008, the United States had completed approximately $20 billion in arms sales agreements with Iraq.\n\nThe U.S.–Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was approved by the Iraqi government on 4 December 2008. It established that U.S. combat forces would withdraw from Iraqi cities by 30 June 2009, and that all U.S. forces would be completely out of Iraq by 31 December 2011. The pact was subject to possible negotiations which could have delayed withdrawal and a referendum scheduled for mid-2009 in Iraq, which might have required all U.S. forces to completely leave by the middle of 2010. The pact required criminal charges for holding prisoners over 24 hours, and required a warrant for searches of homes and buildings that are not related to combat.\n\nU.S. contractors working for U.S. forces were to be subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies may retain their immunity. If U.S. forces commit still undecided \"major premeditated felonies\" while off-duty and off-base, they will be subject to the still undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.‑Iraq committee if the United States certifies the forces were off-duty.\n\nSome Americans have discussed \"loopholes\" and some Iraqis have said they believe parts of the pact remain a \"mystery\". U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates predicted that after 2011 he expected to see \"perhaps several tens of thousands of American troops\" as part of a residual force in Iraq.\n\nSeveral groups of Iraqis protested the passing of the SOFA accord as prolonging and legitimizing the occupation. Tens of thousands of Iraqis burned an effigy of George W. Bush in a central Baghdad square where U.S. troops five years previously organized a tearing down of a statue of Saddam Hussein. Some Iraqis expressed skeptical optimism that the U.S. would completely end its presence by 2011. On 4 December 2008, Iraq's presidential council approved the security pact.\n\nA representative of Grand Ayatollah Ali Husseini al‑Sistani expressed concern with the ratified version of the pact and noted that the government of Iraq has no authority to control the transfer of occupier forces into and out of Iraq, no control of shipments, and that the pact grants the occupiers immunity from prosecution in Iraqi courts. He said that Iraqi rule in the country is not complete while the occupiers are present, but that ultimately the Iraqi people would judge the pact in a referendum. Thousands of Iraqis have gathered weekly after Friday prayers and shouted anti‑U.S. and anti-Israeli slogans protesting the security pact between Baghdad and Washington. A protester said that despite the approval of the Interim Security pact, the Iraqi people would break it in a referendum next year.\n\nOn 1 January 2009, the United States handed control of the Green Zone and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose 1 January be declared national \"Sovereignty Day\". \"This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status\", al‑Maliki said.\n\nThe U.S. military attributed a decline in reported civilian deaths to several factors including the U.S.‑led \"troop surge\", the growth of U.S.-funded Awakening Councils, and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.\n\nOn 31 January, Iraq held provincial elections. Provincial candidates and those close to them faced some political assassinations and attempted assassinations, and there was also some other violence related to the election.\n\nIraqi voter turnout failed to meet the original expectations which were set and was the lowest on record in Iraq, but U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker characterized the turnout as \"large\". Of those who turned out to vote, some groups complained of disenfranchisement and fraud. After the post-election curfew was lifted, some groups made threats about what would happen if they were unhappy with the results.\nOn 27 February, United States President Barack Obama gave a speech at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in the U.S. state of North Carolina announcing that the U.S. combat mission in Iraq would end by 31 August 2010. A \"transitional force\" of up to 50,000 troops tasked with training the Iraqi Security Forces, conducting counterterrorism operations, and providing general support may remain until the end of 2011, the president added. However, the insurgency in 2011 and the rise of ISIS in 2014 caused the war to continue\n\nThe day before Obama's speech, Prime Minister of Iraq Nuri al‑Maliki said at a press conference that the government of Iraq had \"no worries\" over the impending departure of U.S. forces and expressed confidence in the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces and police to maintain order without U.S. military support.\n\nOn 9 April, the 6th anniversary of Baghdad's fall to coalition forces, tens of thousands of Iraqis thronged Baghdad to mark the anniversary and demand the immediate departure of coalition forces. The crowds of Iraqis stretched from the Sadr City slum in northeast Baghdad to the square around away, where protesters burned an effigy featuring the face of U.S. President George W. Bush. There were also Sunni Muslims in the crowd. Police said many Sunnis, including prominent leaders such as a founding sheikh from the Sons of Iraq, took part.\n\nOn 30 April, the United Kingdom formally ended combat operations. Prime Minister Gordon Brown characterized the operation in Iraq as a \"success story\" because of UK troops' efforts. Britain handed control of Basra to the United States Armed Forces.\n\nOn 28 July, Australia withdrew its combat forces as the Australian military presence in Iraq ended, per an agreement with the Iraqi government.\n\nThe withdrawal of U.S. forces began at the end of June, with 38 bases to be handed over to Iraqi forces. On 29 June 2009, U.S. forces withdrew from Baghdad. On 30 November 2009, Iraqi Interior Ministry officials reported that the civilian death toll in Iraq fell to its lowest level in November since the 2003 invasion.\n\nOn 30 June and 11 December 2009, the Iraqi ministry of oil awarded contracts to international oil companies for some of Iraq's many oil fields. The winning oil companies enter joint ventures with the Iraqi ministry of oil, and the terms of the awarded contracts include extraction of oil for a fixed fee of approximately $1.40 per barrel. The fees will only be paid once a production threshold set by the Iraqi ministry of oil is reached.\n\nOn 17 February 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates announced that as of 1 September, the name \"Operation Iraqi Freedom\" would be replaced by \"Operation New Dawn\".\n\nOn 18 April, U.S. and Iraqi forces killed Abu Ayyub al-Masri the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq in a joint American and Iraqi operation near Tikrit, Iraq. The coalition forces believed al-Masri to be wearing a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri, Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi, an assistant to al-Masri, and al-Baghdadi's son. A suicide vest was indeed found on al-Masri's corpse, as the Iraqi Army subsequently stated.\nIraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced the killings of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri at a news conference in Baghdad and showed reporters photographs of their bloody corpses. \"The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles,\" Mr Maliki said. \"During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists, Osama bin Laden and [his deputy] Ayman al-Zawahiri\", Maliki added. U.S. forces commander Gen. Raymond Odierno praised the operation. \"The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al‑Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency\", he said. \"There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists.\"\n\nU.S. Vice President Joe Biden stated that the deaths of the top two al‑Qaeda figures in Iraq are \"potentially devastating\" blows to the terror network there and proof that Iraqi security forces are gaining ground.\n\nOn 20 June, Iraq's Central Bank was bombed in an attack that left 15 people dead and brought much of downtown Baghdad to a standstill. The attack was claimed to have been carried out by the Islamic State of Iraq. This attack was followed by another attack on Iraq's Bank of Trade building that killed 26 and wounded 52 people.\n\nIn late August 2010, insurgents conducted a major attack with at least 12 car bombs simultaneously detonating from Mosul to Basra and killing at least 51. These attacks coincided with the U.S. plans for a withdrawal of combat troops.\n\nFrom the end of August 2010, the United States attempted to dramatically cut its combat role in Iraq, with the withdrawal of all U.S. ground forces designated for active combat operations. The last U.S. combat brigades departed Iraq in the early morning of 19 August. Convoys of U.S. troops had been moving out of Iraq to Kuwait for several days, and NBC News broadcast live from Iraq as the last convoy crossed the border. While all combat brigades left the country, an additional 50,000 personnel (including Advise and Assist Brigades) remained in the country to provide support for the Iraqi military. These troops are required to leave Iraq by 31 December 2011 under an agreement between the U.S. and Iraqi governments.\n\nThe desire to step back from an active counter-insurgency role did not however mean that the Advise and Assist Brigades and other remaining U.S. forces would not be caught up in combat. A standards memo from the Associated Press reiterated \"combat in Iraq is not over, and we should not uncritically repeat suggestions that it is, even if they come from senior officials\".\n\nState Department spokesman P. J. Crowley stated \"... we are not ending our work in Iraq, We have a long-term commitment to Iraq.\" On 31 August, Obama announced the end of Operation Iraqi Freedom from the Oval Office. In his address, he covered the role of the United States' soft power, the effect the war had on the United States economy, and the legacy of the Afghanistan and Iraq wars.\n\nOn the same day in Iraq, at a ceremony at one of Saddam Hussein's former residences at Al Faw Palace in Baghdad, a number of U.S. dignitaries spoke in a ceremony for television cameras, avoiding overtones of the triumphalism present in U.S. announcements made earlier in the war. Vice President Joe Biden expressed concerns regarding the ongoing lack of progress in forming a new Iraqi government, saying of the Iraqi people that \"they expect a government that reflects the results of the votes they cast\". Gen. Ray Odierno stated that the new era \"in no way signals the end of our commitment to the people of Iraq\". Speaking in Ramadi earlier in the day, Gates said that U.S. forces \"have accomplished something really quite extraordinary here, [but] how it all weighs in the balance over time I think remains to be seen\". When asked by reporters if the seven-year war was worth doing, Gates commented that \"It really requires a historian's perspective in terms of what happens here in the long run\". He noted the Iraq War \"will always be clouded by how it began\" regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction, which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, \"This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home\". On the same day Gen. Ray Odierno was replaced by Lloyd Austin as Commander of U.S. forces in Iraq.\nOn 7 September, two U.S. troops were killed and nine wounded in an incident at an Iraqi military base. The incident is under investigation by Iraqi and U.S. forces, but it is believed that an Iraqi soldier opened fire on U.S. forces.\n\nOn 8 September, the U.S. Army announced the arrival in Iraq of the first specifically-designated Advise and Assist Brigade, the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. It was announced that the unit would assume responsibilities in five southern provinces. From 10–13 September, Second Advise and Assist Brigade, 25th Infantry Division fought Iraqi insurgents near Diyala.\n\nAccording to reports from Iraq, hundreds of members of the Sunni Awakening Councils may have switched allegiance back to the Iraqi insurgency or al Qaeda.\n\nIn October, WikiLeaks disclosed 391,832 classified U.S. military documents on the Iraq War. Approximately, 58 people were killed with another 40 wounded in an attack on the Sayidat al‑Nejat church, a Chaldean Catholic church in Baghdad. Responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Islamic State in Iraq organization.\n\nCoordinated attacks in primarily Shia areas struck throughout Baghdad on 2 November, killing approximately 113 and wounding 250 with around 17 bombs.\n\nAs U.S. forces departed the country, the Iraq Defense Ministry solidified plans to purchase advanced military equipment from the United States. Plans in 2010 called for $13 billion of purchases, to include 140 M1 Abrams main battle tanks. In addition to the $13 billion purchase, the Iraqis also requested 18 F-16 Fighting Falcons as part of a $4.2 billion program that also included aircraft training and maintenance, AIM‑9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles, laser-guided bombs and reconnaissance equipment. All Abrams tanks were delivered by the end of 2011, but the first F-16s did not arrive in Iraq until 2015, due to concerns that the Islamic State might overrun Balad Air Base.\n\nThe Iraqi navy also purchased 12 U.S.‑built Swift-class patrol boats, at a cost of $20 million each. Delivery was completed in 2013. The vessels are used to protect the oil terminals at Basra and Khor al-Amiya. Two U.S.‑built offshore support vessels, each costing $70 million, were delivered in 2011.\n\nIn a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN restrictions on Iraq. These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the Oil-for-Food Programme.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr returned to Iraq in the holy city of Najaf to lead the Sadrist movement after being in exile since 2007.\n\nOn 15 January 2011, three U.S. troops were killed in Iraq. One of the troops was killed on a military operation in central Iraq, while the other two troops were deliberately shot by one or two Iraqi soldiers during a training exercise.\n\nOn 6 June, five U.S. troops were killed in an apparent rocket attack on JSS Loyalty. A sixth soldier, who was wounded in the attack, died 10 days later of his wounds.\n\nOn 13 June 2011, two U.S. troops were killed in an IED attack located in Wasit Province.\n\nOn 26 June 2011, a U.S. troop was killed. Sergeant Brent McBride was sentenced to four years, two months for the death.\n\nOn 29 June, three U.S. troops were killed in a rocket attack on a U.S. base located near the border with Iran. It was speculated that the militant group responsible for the attack was the same one which attacked JSS Loyalty just over three weeks before. With the three deaths, June 2011, became the bloodiest month in Iraq for the U.S. military since June 2009, with 15 U.S. soldiers killed, only one of them outside combat.\n\nOn 7 July, two U.S. troops were killed and one seriously injured in a IED attack at Victory Base Complex outside Baghdad. They were members of the 145th Brigade Support Battalion, 116th Cavalry Heavy Brigade Combat Team, an Idaho Army National Guard unit base in Post Falls, Idaho. Spc. Nathan R. Beyers, 24, and Spc. Nicholas W. Newby, 20, were killed in the attack, Staff Sgt. Jazon Rzepa, 30, was seriously injured. \n\nIn September, Iraq signed a contract to buy 18 Lockheed Martin F-16 warplanes, becoming the 26th nation to operate the F-16. Because of windfall profits from oil, the Iraqi government is planning to double this originally planned 18, to 36 F-16s. Iraq is relying on the U.S. military for air support as it rebuilds its forces and battles a stubborn Islamist insurgency.\n\nWith the collapse of the discussions about extending the stay of any U.S. troops beyond 2011, where they would not be granted any immunity from the Iraqi government, on 21 October 2011, President Obama announced at a White House press conference that all remaining U.S. troops and trainers would leave Iraq by the end of the year as previously scheduled, bringing the U.S. mission in Iraq to an end. The last American soldier to die in Iraq before the withdrawal was killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad on 14 November.\n\nIn November 2011, the U.S. Senate voted down a resolution to formally end the war by bringing its authorization by Congress to an end.\n\nOn 15 December, an American military ceremony was held in Baghdad putting a formal end to the U.S. mission in Iraq.\nThe last U.S. troops withdrew from Iraq on 18 December, although the U.S. embassy and consulates continue to maintain a staff of more than 20,000 including U.S. Marine Embassy Guards and between 4,000 and 5,000 private military contractors. The next day, Iraqi officials issued an arrest warrant for the Sunni Vice-President Tariq al-Hashimi. He has been accused of involvement in assassinations and fled to the Kurdish part of Iraq.\n\nThe invasion and occupation led to sectarian violence which caused widespread displacement among Iraqi civilians. The Iraqi Red Crescent organization estimated the total internal displacement was around 2.3 million in 2008, with as many as 2 million Iraqis having left the country. Poverty led many Iraqi women to turn to prostitution to support themselves and their families, attracting sex tourists from regional lands. The invasion led to a constitution which supported democracy as long as laws did not violate traditional Islamic principles, and a parliamentary election was held in 2005. In addition the invasion preserved the autonomy of the Kurdish region, and stability brought new economic prosperity. Because the Kurdish region is historically the most democratic area of Iraq, many Iraqi refugees from other territories fled into the Kurdish land.\n\nIraqi insurgency surged in the aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal as insurgent groups, primarily radical Sunni, fought against the central government. Some 1,000 people were killed across Iraq within the first two months after U.S. withdrawal.\n\nSectarian violence continued in the first half of 2013. At least 56 people died in April when a Sunni protest in Hawija was interrupted by a government-supported helicopter raid and a series of violent incidents occurred in May. On 20 May 2013, at least 95 people died in a wave of car bomb attacks that was preceded by a car bombing on 15 May that led to 33 deaths; also, on 18 May, 76 people were killed in the Sunni areas of Baghdad. Some experts have stated that Iraq could return to the brutal sectarian conflict of 2006.\n\nOn 22 July 2013, at least five hundred convicts, most of whom were senior members of al-Qaida who had received death sentences, broke out of Iraq's Abu Ghraib jail when comrades launched a military-style assault to free them. The attack began when a suicide bomber drove a car packed with explosives into prison gates. James F. Jeffrey, the United States ambassador in Baghdad when the last American troops exited, said the assault and resulting escape \"will provide seasoned leadership and a morale boost to Al Qaeda and its allies in both Iraq and Syria ... it is likely to have an electrifying impact on the Sunni population in Iraq, which has been sitting on the fence.\"\n\nBy mid-2014 the country was in chaos with a new government yet to be formed following national elections, and the insurgency reaching new heights. In early June 2014 the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) took over the cities of Mosul and Tikrit and said it was ready to march on Baghdad, while Iraqi Kurdish forces took control of key military installations in the major oil city of Kirkuk. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki asked his parliament to declare a state of emergency that would give him increased powers, but the lawmakers refused.\n\nIn the summer of 2014, President Obama announced the return of U.S. forces to Iraq, but only in the form of aerial support, in an effort to halt the advance of ISIS forces, render humanitarian aid to stranded refugees and stabilize the political situation. On 14 August 2014, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki succumbed to pressure at home and abroad to step down. This paved the way for Haidar al-Abadi to take over on 19 August 2014. A civil war between ISIS and the central government continued for the next three years, until the government declared victory in December 2017. By 2018, violence in Iraq was at its lowest level in ten years.\n\nArticles in The Lancet and Al Jazeera have suggested that the number of cases of cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, illnesses and premature births may have increased dramatically after the first and second Iraq wars, due to the presences of depleted uranium and chemicals introduced during American attacks.For coalition death totals see the infobox at the top right. See also Casualties of the Iraq War, which has casualty numbers for coalition nations, contractors, non-Iraqi civilians, journalists, media helpers, aid workers, and the wounded. Casualty figures, especially Iraqi ones, are highly disputed. \n\nThere have been several attempts by the media, coalition governments and others to estimate the Iraqi casualties. The table below summarizes some of these estimates and methods.\n\nThe Bush Administration's rationale for the Iraq War has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, with many U.S. citizens finding many parallels with the Vietnam War. For example, a former CIA officer described the Office of Special Plans as a group of ideologues who were dangerous to U.S. national security and a threat to world peace, and stated that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam. The Center for Public Integrity alleges that the Bush administration made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq's alleged threat to the United States.\n\nBoth proponents and opponents of the invasion have also criticized the prosecution of the war effort along a number of other lines. Most significantly, critics have assailed the United States and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission, not adequately planning for post-invasion Iraq, and for permitting and perpetrating human rights abuses. As the war has progressed, critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs. In 2016, the United Kingdom published the Iraq Inquiry, a public inquiry which was broadly critical of the actions of the British government and military in making the case for the war, in tactics and in planning for the aftermath of the war.\nCriticisms include:\n\nAfter President Barack Obama was inaugurated in 2009, some anti-war groups decided to stop protesting even though the war was still going on. Some of them decided to stop because they felt they should give the new President time to establish his administration, and others stopped because they believed that Obama would end the war.\n\nIn March 2013, the total cost of the Iraq War to date was estimated at $1.7 trillion by the Watson Institute of International Studies at Brown University. Some argue that the total cost of the war to the U.S. economy will range from $3 trillion to , including interest rates, by 2053, as described in the Watson Institute's report. The upper ranges of these estimates include long-term veterans costs and economic impacts. For example, Harvard's public finance expert Linda J. Bilmes has estimated that the long-term cost of providing disability compensation and medical care to U.S. troops injured in the Iraq conflict will reach nearly $1 trillion over the next 40 years, and that the war in Iraq diverted resources from the war in Afghanistan, led to rising oil prices, increased the federal debt, and contributed to a global financial crisis.\n\nA CNN report noted that the United States-led interim government, the Coalition Provisional Authority lasting until 2004 in Iraq had lost $8.8 billion in the Development Fund for Iraq. In June 2011, it was reported by CBS News that $6 billion in neatly packaged blocks of $100 bills was air-lifted into Iraq by the George W. Bush administration, which flew it into Baghdad aboard C‑130 military cargo planes. In total, the \"Times\" says $12 billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate flights by May 2004, all of which has disappeared. An inspector general's report mentioned that \"'Severe inefficiencies and poor management' by the Coalition Provisional Authority would leave no guarantee that the money was properly used\", said Stuart W. Bowen, Jr., director of the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction. \"The CPA did not establish or implement sufficient managerial, financial and contractual controls to ensure that funds were used in a transparent manner.\" Bowen told the Times the missing money may represent \"the largest theft of funds in national history.\"\n\nThe child malnutrition rate rose to 28%. Some 60–70% of Iraqi children were reported to be suffering from psychological problems in 2007. Most Iraqis had no access to safe drinking water. A cholera outbreak in northern Iraq was thought to be the result of poor water quality. As many as half of Iraqi doctors left the country between 2003 and 2006. The use of depleted uranium and white phosphorus by the U.S. military has been blamed for birth defects and cancers in the Iraqi city of Fallujah.\n\nBy the end of 2015, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 4.4 million Iraqis had been internally displaced. The population of Iraqi Christians dropped dramatically during the war, from 1.5 million in 2003 to 500,000 in 2015, and perhaps only 275,000 in 2016.\n\nThe Foreign Policy Association reported that \"Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis ... has been the inability for the United States to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the United States has granted around 84,000 Iraqis refugee status, of the more than two million global Iraqi refugees. By contrast, the United States granted asylum to more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees during the Vietnam War.\"\n\nThroughout the entire Iraq war, there have been human rights abuses on all sides of the conflict.\n\n\n\n\nIn a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq. In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54% of Britons supported the military action against Iraq.\n\nAccording to a January 2007 BBC World Service poll of more than 26,000 people in 25 countries, 73% of the global population disapproved of U.S. handling of the Iraq War. A September 2007 poll conducted by the BBC found that two-thirds of the world's population believed the U.S. should withdraw its forces from Iraq.\n\nIn 2006 it was found that majorities in the UK and Canada believed that the war in Iraq was \"unjustified\" and – in the UK – were critical of their government's support of U.S. policies in Iraq.\n\nAccording to polls conducted by the Arab American Institute, four years after the invasion of Iraq, 83% of Egyptians had a negative view of the U.S. role in Iraq; 68% of Saudi Arabians had a negative view; 96% of the Jordanian population had a negative view; 70% of the population of the United Arab Emirates and 76% of the Lebanese population also described their view as negative. The Pew Global Attitudes Project reports that in 2006 majorities in the Netherlands, (Germany), Jordan, France, Lebanon, Russia, China, Canada, Poland, Pakistan, Spain, Indonesia, Turkey, and Morocco believed the world was safer before the Iraq War and the toppling of Saddam, while pluralities in the United States and India believe the world is safer without Saddam Hussein.\n\nDirectly after the invasion, polling suggested that a slight majority supported the U.S. invasion. Polls conducted between 2005 and 2007 showed 31–37% of Iraqis wanted U.S. and other Coalition forces to withdraw once security was restored and that 26–35% wanted immediate withdrawal instead. Despite a majority having previously been opposed to the U.S. presence, 60% of Iraqis opposed American troops leaving directly prior to withdrawal, with 51% saying withdrawal would have a negative effect. In 2006, a poll conducted on the Iraqi public revealed that 52% of the ones polled said Iraq was going in the right direction and 61% claimed it was worth ousting Saddam Hussein. In a March 2007 BBC poll, 82% of Iraqis expressed a lack of confidence in coalition forces based in Iraq.\n\nThough explicitly stating that Iraq had \"nothing\" to do with 9/11, erstwhile President George W. Bush consistently referred to the Iraq war as \"the central front in the War on Terror\", and argued that if the United States pulled out of Iraq, \"terrorists will follow us here\". While other proponents of the war regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict dragged on, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. public, and even U.S. troops questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-U.S. terrorism. In particular, a consensus developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war actually increased terrorism. Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a \"fatal mistake\".\n\nLondon's International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become \"a potent global recruitment pretext\" for Mujahideen and that the invasion \"galvanised\" al-Qaeda and \"perversely inspired insurgent violence\" there. The U.S. National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with \"a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills ... There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.\" The Council's chairman Robert Hutchings said, \"At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.\" And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that \"The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause célèbre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.\"\n\nAccording to studies, most of the suicide bombers in Iraq are foreigners, especially Saudis.\n\nAs an ally of Iraq, Russia was opposed to the invasion of Iraq. The foreign ministers of Russia, France and Germany made a joint declaration that they will \"not allow\" passage of a UN Security Council resolution authorising war against Iraq. Russia gave information to Saddam's government about the Bush administration's plans. The information included troop deployments, equipment, and their locations.\n\nThough the Chinese and Russian governments opposed the Iraq War, both China and Russia have benefited from the Iraq War while suffering none of the losses incurred by the countries that invaded. Two of the biggest Iraqi oil contracts went to China and Russia, while the war itself allowed China to present itself as an alternative source of investment to the United States.\n\nAlthough some military intelligence analysts have concluded there is no concrete evidence, U.S. Major General Rick Lynch has claimed that Iran has provided training, weapons, money, and intelligence to Shiite insurgents in Iraq and that up to 150 Iranian intelligence agents, plus members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard are believed to be active in Iraq at any given time. Lynch thinks that members of the IRGC's Quds Force have trained members of the Qazali terror network in explosives technology and also provided the network with arms, munitions, and military advisors. Many explosive devices, including improvised explosives (IEDs) and explosively-formed projectiles (EFPs), used by insurgents are claimed by Lynch to be Iranian-made or designed.\n\nAccording to two unnamed U.S. officials, the Pentagon is examining the possibility that the Karbala provincial headquarters raid, in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five U.S. soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians. In a speech on , Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki stated that Iran was supporting attacks against Coalition forces in Iraq and some Iraqis suspect that the raid may have been perpetrated by the Quds Force in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials by U.S. forces in the northern Iraqi city of Irbil on .\n\nIn 2011, U.S. ambassador James Franklin Jeffrey stated \"that Iranian proxies accounted for roughly a quarter of US combat casualties in Iraq—around 1,100 deaths and many thousands more injuries.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "262536", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=262536", "title": "Jade Goody", "text": "Jade Goody\n\nJade Cerisa Lorraine Tweed ( Goody; 5 June 1981 – 22 March 2009) was an English reality-television personality. She entered the public spotlight in the third series of the then-Channel 4 programme \"Big Brother\" in 2002, an appearance which led to her own TV programs and the introduction of her products after her eviction from the show.\n\nImmediately criticised by the British press for her perceived lack of decorum and intelligence, Goody was dubbed by multiple outlets as \"the most hated woman in Britain\". The country's celebrity magazines were less derisive, publishing reports of her affable nature and competent school performance from those who knew her. Public opinion of Goody reached its most negative in January 2007, however, when she was accused of racially bullying Indian actress Shilpa Shetty while appearing as a housemate on \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\". Following her eviction, Goody made a number of apologies, but continued to garner negative public reactions.\nIn August 2008, Goody appeared on the Indian version of \"Big Brother\", \"Bigg Boss\", but left the show early and returned to the UK after learning that she had cervical cancer. By February 2009, the cancer had metastasized, and Goody was terminally ill. She married fellow \"Celebrity Big Brother\" contestant Jack Tweed on 22 February 2009, and died one month later, in the early hours of 22 March 2009, at the age of 27.\n\nPublic opinion of Goody had softened by the time of her death. Sky Living broadcast five tribute shows from 2009 to 2012, documenting her life from early childhood through her rise to fame and her final months. The last episode of \"Big Brother\" on Channel 4 featured a 15-minute tribute to Goody, praising her as the ultimate \"Big Brother\" contestant. She was one of several people to appear on the front cover of the final edition of \"News of the World\" on 10 July 2011.\n\nGoody was born in Bermondsey, London, to Jackiey Budden and Andrew Goody. Her father was a drug addict and habitual criminal who spent time in prison, including a four-year term for robbery. He and Budden separated when Goody was two; estranged from his daughter while Budden raised her, he died of a drug overdose in 2006. At the age of 5, Goody made an uncredited appearance as a primary school student in the 1986 television film \"London's Burning\" (filmed in her home town), which spawned the television series of the same name. Before entering the \"Big Brother\" house, Goody, a dental nurse, lived in Upshire, Waltham Abbey, Essex.\n\nWhen Goody appeared on \"Big Brother 3\", she was ridiculed by the British tabloid press for her lack of general knowledge. She thought the English city of Cambridge was in London; when told that it was in East Anglia, she assumed East Anglia was outside Britain and referred to it as \"East Angula\". Goody thought that Rio de Janeiro was a person, not a city; that Portugal was part of Spain; that St George's Cross was the flag of London, not England; that Aberdeen was not in Scotland, and that the United States was not an English-speaking country. She was also criticised by the tabloid press during her time in the \"Big Brother\" house for backstabbing and an evening when she cavorted drunk and naked.\n\nGoody appeared in her own reality TV shows and, regularly, in celebrity, trivia and gossip-oriented women's magazines such as \"Heat\" and \"OK!\". She participated in the 2006 London Marathon but did not finish (collapsing after of the course), and recovered overnight at the Royal London Hospital. Before the marathon, Goody described her preparations to TV chef Gordon Ramsay: \"I've been eating curry, Chinese and drinking.\" She said afterwards, \"I don't really understand miles. I didn't actually know how far it was going to be ... I didn't want to let everyone down.\" Goody raised £565.20 for her chosen charity, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nOn 16 February 2004, Goody entered the \"Back to Reality\" house on Channel 5. The series, similar to \"Big Brother\", featured contestants from other reality shows such as \"Big Brother\" and \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\". She was evicted on Day 20.\n\nIn 2005 Goody created and introduced her own fragrance (Shh...) with distributor Jigsaw ESL, who gave its exclusive rights to Superdrug. Shh... became Superdrug's third-bestselling fragrance, behind Kylie Minogue's and Victoria Beckham's. On 2 May 2006, \"Jade: My Autobiography\" was published.\n\nOn 5 January 2007 Goody, her boyfriend Jack Tweed and her mother entered the house for \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\".\nShe had just placed 25th in a \"Heat\" poll of the world's most influential people, with lifetime earnings of £8 million. Goody was told that she and her family (later joined by Jermaine Jackson, Shilpa Shetty and Ken Russell) would live luxuriously in the main house, with the eight remaining celebrities living in the house next door as their servants. She was not told that she and her new family faced an eviction in which the public chose whom to keep. Goody's mother was the first to be evicted, on 10 January 2007.\n\nA number of complaints were received by British broadcasting regulator Ofcom about the behaviour of Jo O'Meara, Danielle Lloyd and Goody towards housemate Shilpa Shetty. By 20 January Ofcom received more than 44,500 complaints from the public (a record at the time), and Channel 4 received an additional 3,000 complaints.\n\nAmong Goody's remarks were, \"I've seen how she goes in and out of people's arseholes\" and Shetty \"makes [her] skin crawl\". She also called Shetty \"Shilpa Fuckawalla\" and \"Shilpa Poppadom\". Other, unbroadcast incidents of racism were later alleged, including a late-night limerick game between O'Meara, Lloyd, Goody and Tweed in which the word \"Paki\" was implied but not said. Goody allegedly wondered aloud if Lloyd used \"the P-word\", and referred to Shetty as \"Shilpa Pashwa whoever you fucking are\".\n\nThe incident triggered an international outcry, receiving extensive coverage in the Indian media (where Gordon Brown, then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was visiting at the time). Brown condemned the programme for damaging the impression of Britain as a country of tolerance. In a 17 January statement, Channel 4 defended the programme against charges \"of overt racism or racial abuse\".\n\nGoody was evicted from the \"Big Brother\" house on 19 January 2007, receiving 82 percent of the vote when she was up against Shetty. Channel 4 prevented crowds from gathering outside the house, and cancelled her scheduled press conference. In an interview with Davina McCall shortly afterwards, Goody said she was \"disgusted with [her]self\" after seeing a video of the alleged bullying. Her much-publicised return to the Big Brother house was called \"a terrible decision\" by publicist Max Clifford: \"It looks like she has ruined a very lucrative career\". At this time Goody was a supporter of the anti-bullying charity Act Against Bullying, which dropped her. In an interview with the \"Daily Star\", Goody said that her abuse of Shetty ruined her girl-next-door image.\n\nAlthough Shetty did not lodge an official complaint about racist behaviour with \"Big Brother\", her allegations compelled police to investigate the possible classification of her treatment as \"racial hatred\" under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986. In a statement, the Hertfordshire police said that it was\n ... investigating allegations of racist behaviour in the \"Big Brother\" house and will be conducting enquiries, including a review of the tapes. We will continue to liaise with Ofcom and with Endemol, whom we have strongly encouraged to ensure that any form of behaviour that could raise similar concerns, does not occur. We will continue to closely monitor the situation over the next few days. Hertfordshire Constabulary will not tolerate racism in any form and is taking these allegations seriously. The constabulary has experience of investigating and resolving incidents in the \"Big Brother\" house in past seasons.\n\nAccording to a Channel 4 spokeswoman, \"Big Brother\" intervened so the contestants would \"realise that what they have said has been misconstrued in the house\". The idea, she said, was to allow the housemates \"to explain themselves\" to their fellow contestants. This was followed by a series of apologies to Shetty from the housemates, and her belief that Goody was not a racist: \"I don't feel there was any racial discrimination happening from Jade's end ... I think that there are a lot of insecurities from her end but it's definitely not racial\". However, Shetty was unaware of all the alleged insults (often made behind her back). Channel 4 was rebuked by Ofcom, which received more than 54,000 complaints, for its handling of the scandal.\n\nGoody initially denied that her comments were racist: \"She is Indian, thinking of an Indian name and only thing I could think of was Indian food. Wasn't racial at all. It was not to offend any Indian out there.\" On a later trip to India she apologised for her behaviour, admitting that her remarks to Shetty could be seen as racist. In a video on the BBC News website, Goody said:\nI know that things that I don't think are necessarily racist ... could be ... And I am sincerely sorry for the pain and hurt I've caused to Shilpa's family. I am wrong ... I am wrong and I know that my words and my actions were wrong and I'm not trying to justify that in any way – I am wrong, and the people who have complained are not wrong. They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.\n\nBigg Boss\n\nGoody said in April 2008 that she planned to introduce her second fragrance line, Controversial. In mid-2008 she appeared in the Indian version of \"Big Brother\", \"Bigg Boss\", at a rumoured salary of £100,000. Goody entered the house on 17 August, saying in her opening videotape that the incident with Shetty was \"in the past\" and she was \"not proud of it\". Two days into the show she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and immediately withdrew, flying home to England. Scenes of Goody learning her diagnosis were not broadcast in India.\n\nLiving With Jade Goody\nA reality-television documentary, \"Living With Jade Goody\", was shown in September 2008 as part of the \"Living With...\" series on Living TV.\nIn October she opened her second beauty salon, \"Homme Fatel\" (for men), and her second autobiography (\"Jade: Catch A Falling Star\", covering her time on \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\") was published by John Blake Publishing. A documentary film, \"Jade's Cancer Battle\", was aired on 11 December with further shows planned if Goody could participate. At the end of 2008 she played the Wicked Queen in a Christmas pantomime version of \"Snow White\" at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln to critical praise, but withdrew from the production in January 2009 for health reasons.\n\nGoody had two sons. In 2006 she began a relationship with Jack Tweed, who appeared with her on \"Celebrity Big Brother\". In June 2007, she had a miscarriage. After allegations of Tweed's infidelity they broke up, later reconciling. Tweed lived with Goody and her children in Buckhurst Hill, Essex, until his imprisonment for a December 2006 assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a 16-year-old boy. He served four months of an eighteen-month sentence before his release on 27 January 2009 with electronic monitoring and a curfew. Goody and Tweed exchanged rings on 15 February in a private, informal ceremony on the banks of the River Thames, and they married on 22 February at Down Hall country house near Hatfield Heath. Goody wore a £3,500 Manuel Mota dress, a gift from Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed. The couple signed an exclusive £700,000 deal with \"OK!\" magazine for photographs of the ceremony, and Tweed was exempted from his curfew for 22–23 February. He was convicted for common assault on 3 March 2009 for a 5 May 2008 attack on a taxi driver, sentenced to 12 weeks' imprisonment at Harlow Magistrates Court on 14 April and released on 29 May.\n\nGoody had a number of health scares during the 2000s. In 2002 (shortly before her \"Big Brother 3\" appearance) a cervical smear test revealed abnormal cells, a possible indicator of cancer. She was tested for ovarian cancer in 2004 and bowel cancer in 2006, with negative results for each. Goody had hospital tests in early August 2008, after her fourth cancer scare; she had collapsed four times. On 19 August, while she was on the Indian reality show \"Bigg Boss\", Goody was told that test results confirmed cervical cancer. According to her spokesperson, \"It looks like her cancer is at an early stage but we will have to wait until she gets back to Britain and sees a specialist and has more tests.\"\n\nOn 1 September 2008, it was reported that Goody's cancer was \"advanced and life-threatening\" and she would have surgery followed by chemotherapy. Doctors gave her a 65-percent chance of survival. Further tests and a radical hysterectomy \"went well\", according to her publicist, and Goody began chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÉ, Goody said she had begun planning her funeral, was losing her hair and had decided not to explain her illness to her children, aged 4 and 5 at the time.\n\nOn 4 February 2009, Goody's publicist, Max Clifford, confirmed that her cancer had spread to her liver, bowel and groin. A previous 40-percent chance of survival was withdrawn, and she began treatment to prolong her life. On 7 February, Clifford reported that Goody had emergency surgery in London to remove a tumour on her bowel.\n\nOn 14 February, Clifford confirmed media reports that doctors at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London had classified her cancer as terminal; she could die within weeks, and at best was unlikely to survive more than a few months: \"She was informed yesterday that tragically, she's terminally ill. She was obviously devastated.\" Goody then began drawing up a will and planning for the care of her two sons.\n\nOn 5 March in the Royal Marsden Hospital, Goody asked to be baptised; two days later, she and her sons were christened. Clifford confirmed that this was her last public appearance, and she had already said her goodbyes to her family: \"We're hoping and praying that Jade pulls through, but the fact of the matter is that she now only has a short time to live.\" He confirmed that during the next 24 hours her doctors could assess how long Goody had to live, but she had a very short time left in any case. Jack Tweed was allowed to extend his curfew, spending a last night with his wife before she said goodbye to the rest of her family.\n\nWhen the news spread that Goody's cancer was terminal, medical authorities in the UK began reporting a surge in requests from women (particularly younger women) for cervical-cancer screening. This reversed a trend which had seen demand for screening decline over the past decade, with the greatest decline among women aged 25–29.\n\nAs a result of the publicity surrounding Goody's illness, on 13 March 2009 government health ministers agreed to review the National Health Service policy not to screen for cervical cancer until age 25 in England (age 20 in the rest of the UK). That day, she issued a press release that she was \"immensely proud\" to have prompted the review.\n\nGoody died in her sleep in the early hours of 22 March 2009; her reported time of death varies by source. Her mother, husband and family friend Kevin Adams were at her bedside when she passed away Goody's death was widely covered by the British media, and the BBC was criticised for its extensive coverage of her illness. The corporation later admitted on their \"Newswatch\" programme that, upon reflection, their coverage had been excessive. Shilpa Shetty, who had many confrontations with Jade when they were both on Celebrity Big Brother, visited Goody days before her death and made amends.\nGoody received tributes from all strata of society. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said, \"She was a courageous woman both in life and death and the whole country has admired her determination to provide a bright future for her children.\" Her funeral service took place at noon on 4 April at St John's Anglican Church, Buckhurst Hill, Essex, and later that day she was buried near her home in Epping Forest. The funeral cortège consisted of 21 cars, one of which was a Bentley used by the family. Several celebrities, including David and Victoria Beckham and Simon Cowell, sent flowers, and Davina McCall, Jamelia and Antony Costa were among the mourners. Goody's coffin was white; she was buried in her wedding dress with two pictures, one of each of her sons, at her side. Her sons did not attend the funeral; their father had taken them to Australia.\n\nThousands of mourners followed the funeral service on large screens outside the church. It was broadcast live on Sky News, which followed the service from outside since Goody had wanted a private ceremony for friends and family.\n\nSky Living aired five tributes to Goody, documenting her early life, fame and final months, from 2009 to 2012. The final episode of \"Big Brother\" on Channel 4 featured a 15-minute tribute, praising her as the ultimate \"Big Brother\" contestant.\n\nIn April 2009 Digital Spy called Goody the \"ultimate reality TV star\", and plans were announced for \"Jade the Musical\". That month Michael Parkinson wrote that Goody had become media property \"to be manipulated and exploited till the day she died\", representing \"all that is paltry and wretched about Britain\". On 29 December 2009 \"The Independent\" reported that according to a tribute site, Goody was the most-mourned celebrity of 2009 and received more tributes than Michael Jackson. The premiere of \"Big Brother 10\" was dedicated to her memory, and a tribute was shown on the last episode of \"Ultimate Big Brother\".\n\nThe day of Goody's funeral, a spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK said:\n\nIn October 2009 it was reported that the number of women between 25 and 64 having Pap tests in the United Kingdom had grown by 12 percent during the previous year, an increase (after year-to-year declines since 2002) credited to Goody's public battle with cervical cancer. Sky News health correspondent Thomas Moore said:\n\nAccording to Health Secretary Andy Burnham, \"Jade's bravery and openness in her fight against cervical cancer has brought home to young women across the country the importance of regularly going for these checks.\" Gordon Brown said, \"Her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the UK.\"\n\n\n"}

This historical procession is held annually to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic of Lord Buddha, which is housed at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy. A unique symbol of Sri Lanka, the procession consists of many traditional local dances such as fire-dances, whip-dances, Kandyan dances and various other cultural dances, in addition to the elephants who are usually adorned with lavish garments. The festival ends with the traditional \"diya-kepeema\" ritual, a water cutting ceremony which is held at the Mahaweli River at Getambe, Kandy.\n\nThe Esala is believed to be a fusion of two separate but interconnected \"\"Peraheras\" (Processions) – The \"Esala\" and \"Dalada\". The Esala Perahera, which is thought to date back to the 3rd century BC, was a ritual enacted to request the gods for rainfall. The Dalada Perahera is believed to have begun when the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri Lanka from India during the 4th century CE, eight hundred years after the passing away of Lord Buddha.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Tooth Relic was taken in procession to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala & Prince Dantha.\n\nAfter the Kandyan Kingdom fell to the British in 1815, the custody of the Relic was handed over to the \"Maha Sanga\" (the Buddhist Clergy). In the absence of the king, a chief lay custodian called the \"Diyawadana Nilame\" was appointed to handle routine administrative matters concerning the relic and its care.\n\nThe Kandy Esala Perahera begins with the \"Kap Situveema\" or \"Kappa\", in which a sanctified young Jackfruit tree (Artocarpus integrifolia) is cut and planted in the premises of each of the four Devales dedicated to the four guardian gods Natha, Vishnu, Katharagama and the goddess Pattini. Traditionally it was meant to shower blessing on the King and the people.\n\nFor the next five nights, the \"Devale Peraheras\"\" take place within the premises of the four Devales with the priest of each Devale taking the pole every evening, accompanied by music and drumming, flag and canopy bearers, spearman and the \"Ran Ayudha\", the sacred insignia of the Gods.\n\nOn the sixth night, the \"Kumbal Perahera\" begins and continues on for five days. Initially, the Devale Peraheras assemble in front of the Temple of the Tooth, which is Sri Lanka's most important Buddhist Shrine and where the Buddha’s Sacred Tooth Relic has been kept since the 16th Century) with their insignias placed on the \"ransivige\" (a dome-like structure) accompanied by the Basnayake Nilames (the lay custodians of the Devales).\n\nThe relic casket, which is a replica for the Tooth Relic, is placed inside the ransivige affixed to the Maligawa Elephant, the \"Maligawa Perahera\" joins the awaiting Devale Peraheras and leads the procession. Whip-crackers and fireball acrobats clear the path, followed by the Buddhist flag bearers. Then, riding on the first elephant, is the official called \"Peramuna Rala\" (Front Official). He is followed by Kandyan Drummers and Dancers who enthrall the crowd, and are themselves followed by elephants and other groups of musicians, dancers and flag bearers. A group of singers dressed in white heralds the arrival of the Maligawa Tusker carrying the Sacred Tooth Relic. The Diyawadana Nilame (traditionally required to do everything in his power to ensure rain in the correct season) walks in traditional Kandyan-clothed splendor after the tusker.\n\nThe second procession is from the Natha Devale, which faces the Sri Dalada Maligawa and is said to be the oldest building in Kandy, dating back to the 14th Century.\n\nThe third is from the Vishnu Devale (Vishnu being a Hindu god), also known as the Maha Devale. It is situated in front of the main gate of the Natha Devale.\n\nThe fourth procession is from the Katharagama Devale (dedicated to the God of Kataragama deviyo, identified with the warrior god Skanda) which is on Kottugodalle Vidiya (a street in Kandy). This procession includes Kavadi, the peacock dance, in which the pilgrim-dances carry semicircular wooden contraptions studded with peacock feathers on their shoulders.\n\nThe fifth and final procession is from the Pattini Devale (Pattini being a goddess associated with the cure of infectious diseases and called upon in times of drought and famine), which is situated to the West of the Natha Devale. This is the only procession that has women dances.\n\nThe following important times are announced by the firing of cannonballs, which can be heard all across Kandy.\n\nThe \"Randoli Perahera\" begins after five nights of the Kumbal Perahera. Randoli refers to palanquins on which the Queens of the ruling Kings traditionally traveled. \n2018 Kandy Esala Maha Perahera (Randoli Perahera) was held on 25 August 2018, the full moon poya day with the participation of hundreds thousands people.\n\nAfter a further five nights of the Randoli Perahera, the pageant ends with the \"Diya Kepeema\", which is the water cutting ceremony at the Mahaweli River at Getambe, a town a few miles from Kandy. A Day Perahera is held to mark the ceremony.\n\n\nThe rituals connected with the Tooth Relic are conducted by Monks of the Malwatte Chapter and Asgiriya Chapters of the Buddhist clergy in Sri Lanka. It is the duty of the Diyawadana Nilame to organize the Perahera and thus he summons the large number of officials of the Temple of the Tooth and entrusts them with various ceremonial duties connected with the conducting of the Perahera. He first gets the auspicious time from the \"Nekath Mohottala\", the advisor on astrological matters. The task of organising the different types of drummers is handed over to the four officials known as the \"Panikka Mura Baarakaruwo\".\n\nThe Maligawa officials also meet the owners of the elephants due to take part in the Perahera (most elephants are privately owned). The dance troupes are given time to prepare. The Basnayake Nilames (the lay custodians of the Devales) are then told to organise their processions.\n\nOn completion of the Perahera, the Diyawadana Nilame would lead a procession consisting of the Nilames of Sathara Maha Devalas and the Nilames of rural devalas to the President's Pavilion carrying a sannasa (formal letter) known as the Perahera Sandeshaya to the President stating the successful complition of the annual Esala Perahera. The President would meet and receive the sannasa at the entrance to the President's Pavilion.\n\n\n"}

Pei, surrounded by three smaller pyramids, in the main courtyard (Cour Napoléon) of the Louvre Palace (Palais du Louvre) in Paris. The large pyramid serves as the main entrance to the Louvre Museum. Completed in 1989, it has become a landmark of the city of Paris.\n\nCommissioned by the President of France, François Mitterrand, in 1984, it was designed by the architect I. M. Pei. The structure, which was constructed entirely with glass segments and metal poles, \nreaches a height of . Its square base has sides of and a base surface area of . It consists of 603 rhombus-shaped and 70 triangular glass segments.\nThe pyramid structure was engineered by Nicolet Chartrand Knoll Ltd. of Montreal (Pyramid Structure / Design Consultant) and Rice Francis Ritchie of Paris (Pyramid Structure / Construction Phase).\n\nThe pyramid and the underground lobby beneath it were created because of a series of problems with the Louvre's original main entrance, which could no longer handle the enormous number of visitors on an everyday basis. Visitors entering through the pyramid descend into the spacious lobby then ascend into the main Louvre buildings.\n\nFor design historian Mark Pimlott, \"I.M. Pei’s plan distributes people effectively from the central concourse to myriad destinations within its vast subterranean network... the architectonic framework evokes, at gigantic scale, an ancient atrium of a Pompeiian villa; the treatment of the opening above, with its tracery of engineered castings and cables, evokes the atria of corporate office buildings; the busy movement of people from all directions suggests the concourses of rail termini or international airports.\"\n\nSeveral other museums have duplicated this concept, most notably the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. The Dolphin Centre, featuring a similar pyramid, was opened in April 1982, by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The construction work on the pyramid base and underground lobby was carried out by the Vinci construction company.\n\nIn 1839, according to one newspaper account, in ceremonies commemorating the \"glorious revolution\" of 1830, \"The tombs of the Louvre were covered with black hangings and adorned with tricolored flags. In front and in the middle was erected an expiatory monument of a pyramidical shape, and surmounted by a funeral vase.\"\n\nThe construction of the pyramid triggered many years of strong and lively aesthetic and political debate. Criticisms tended to fall into four areas: (1) the modernist style of the edifice being inconsistent with the classic French Renaissance style and history of the Louvre; (2) the pyramid being an unsuitable symbol of death from ancient Egypt; (3) the project being an immodest, pretentious, megalomaniacal folly imposed by then-President François Mitterrand; and (4) Chinese-American architect I.M. Pei being insufficiently French to be entrusted with the task of updating the treasured Parisian landmark.\n\nThose criticizing the aesthetics said it was \"sacrilegious\" to tamper with the Louvre's majestic old French Renaissance architecture, and called the pyramid an anachronistic intrusion of an Egyptian death symbol in the middle of Paris. Meanwhile, political critics referred to the structure as \"Pharaoh Francois' Pyramid\".\nMany still continue to feel the harsh modernism of the edifice is out of place.\n\nDuring the design phase, there was a proposal that the design include a spire on the pyramid to simplify window washing. Pei objected, however, and this proposal was eliminated.\n\nIt has been claimed by some that the glass panes in the Louvre Pyramid number exactly 666, \"the number of the beast\", often associated with Satan. Dominique Stezepfandt's book \"François Mitterrand, Grand Architecte de l'Univers\" declares that \"the pyramid is dedicated to a power described as the Beast in the Book of Revelation (...) The entire structure is based on the number 6.\"\n\nThe story of the 666 panes originated in the 1980s, when the official brochure published during construction did indeed cite this number (even twice, though a few pages earlier the total number of panes was given as 672 instead). The number 666 was also mentioned in various newspapers. The Louvre museum, however, states that the finished pyramid contains 673 glass panes (603 rhombi and 70 triangles). A higher figure was obtained by David A. Shugarts, who reports that the pyramid contains 689 pieces of glass. Shugarts obtained the figure from the Pei's offices.\n\nElementary arithmetic allows for easy counting of the panes: each of the three sides of the pyramid without an entrance has 18 triangular panes and 17 rows of rhombic ones arranged in a triangle, thus giving formula_1 rhombic panes (171 panes total). The side with the entrance has 11 panes fewer (9 rhombic, 2 triangular), so the whole pyramid consists of formula_2 rhombi and formula_3 triangles, 673 panes total.\n\nThe myth resurfaced in 2003, when Dan Brown incorporated it in his best-selling novel \"The Da Vinci Code\", in which the protagonist reflects that \"this pyramid, at President Mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666 panes of glass — a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who claimed 666 was the number of Satan.\" However, David A. Shugarts reports that according to a spokeswoman of the offices of Pei, the French President never specified the number of panes to be used in the pyramid. Noting how the 666 rumor circulated in some French newspapers in the mid-1980s, she commented: \"If you only found those old articles and didn't do any deeper fact checking, and were extremely credulous, you might believe the 666 story.\"\n\n\"La Pyramide Inversée\" (\"The Inverted Pyramid\") is a skylight in the Carrousel du Louvre shopping mall in front of the Louvre Museum. It looks like an upside-down and smaller version of the \"Louvre Pyramid\".\n\nDesigned for a museum that attracted 4.5 million visitors a year, the pyramid proved inadequate by the time the Louvre's attendance had doubled in 2014. Between 2014 and 2017, the layout of the foyer area in the Cour Napoleon beneath the glass pyramid is undergoing a thorough redesign, including better access to the pyramid and the Passage Richelieu. \n\n"}

Recently made world's tallest statue Statue of Unity in India is not visible from space without magnification. Also the Great Wall of China, is not visible from low Earth orbit without magnifying instrument and even then only under perfect conditions, but not from the Moon. \n\nPart of the problem in authoritatively answering questions about visibility from space is that such questions are often very vaguely framed: askers frequently do not precisely define how far above sea level their hypothetical or actual observer in space is located. When just speaking of \"space\", an asker might mean anywhere from the edge of space (Kármán line) at an altitude of to low Earth orbit of 160–2,000 km (99-1200 mi) to Apollo 12's orbit at to the Moon, which orbits about away. \nThe Kármán line is accepted by the World Air Sports Federation, an international standard setting and record-keeping body for aeronautics and astronautics, as the boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and outer space.\nHowever, a practical definition for the purpose of answering questions on what astronauts generally can see from space would reflect altitudes that manned spacecraft typically orbit the Earth at—often several hundreds of kilometres. There are major differences in visibility from just above the Kármán line (100 km/62 miles) and the ISS orbit (394 km/245 miles), for example.\n\nFrom US Space Shuttles, which typically orbited at around 135 miles (237 km), cities were easily distinguishable from surrounding countryside. Using binoculars, astronauts could even see roads, dams, harbors, even large vehicles such as ships and planes. At night, cities are also easily visible from the higher orbit of the ISS.\n\nMetropolitan areas are clear at night, particularly in industrialized countries, due to a multitude of street lights and other light sources in urban areas (see light pollution).\n\nThe greenhouse complex that covers almost 50,000 acres (200 km) in the province of Almería, Andalucía, Spain\nis visible from space.\n\nThe Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation in the world.\n\nThe claim that the Great Wall of China is the only man-made object visible from the moon or outer space has been debunked many times, but remains a common misconception in popular culture. According to astronauts Eugene Cernan and Ed Lu, the Great Wall is visible from the lower part of low Earth orbit, but only under very favorable conditions.\n\nDifferent claims are made for the factoid that the Great Wall is visible from the Moon. William Stukeley mentioned this claim in his letter dated 1754, and Henry Norman made the same claim in 1895. The issue of \"canals\" on Mars was prominent in the late 19th century and may have led to the belief that long, thin objects were visible from space. A viewer would need visual acuity 17,000 times better than normal to see the Great Wall from the Moon.\n\nTrivia questions and urban legends often claim certain constructed objects or effects are so large they are visible from outer space. For example, a giant beaver dam in Canada was described as \"so large it is visible from outer space.\" \"Field and Stream\", a Canadian Magazine, wrote, \"How big? Big enough to be visible ... from outer space.\"\n\n"}

Although local festivals have been part and parcel of frontier life for decades, Marmot Day became an official holiday on April 18, 2009, when the 26th Alaska State Legislature officially passed Senate Bill 58. Marmot Day is celebrated on February 2, replacing Groundhog Day with a holiday honoring Alaska's marmots. From Juneau to Anchorage to Fairbanks, and all the cities in between, Marmot Day has become an Alaskan institution.\n\nSenate Bill 58, sponsored by Sen. Linda Menard, R-Wasilla, was first introduced by the late Dr. Curtis Menard, Linda Menard's husband and former state legislator. Concerned by the gradual decline of Alaska's folk values, and worried that the 49th state would become a suburb of Houston both culturally and economically, Dr. Menard drew a line in the sand with his idea of creating Marmot Day in the 1990s. After getting stuck in a committee while politics was played, the controversial Marmot Day bill died in the legislature. Sen. Linda Menard reintroduced the bill for the 26th Alaska Legislature, and the bill passed by a Marmot's whisker on the second to last day of the legislative session, and Sarah Palin signed it into law. As Senator Menard said, \"By recognizing the marmot, our state [built] a tradition and legacy to be built on for future generations.\n\nMarmot Day is also the name of a community celebration in Owosso, Michigan, occurring on July 25 (or on the following Monday if the 25th falls on a weekend). It is a celebration of all marmots, which include groundhogs, woodchucks, and ground squirrels.\n\nMarmot Day was first celebrated in 2002 as a day celebrating all marmots. A luncheon is traditional as part of the celebration, marmot jokes and ginger snaps are shared, among other festivities typical of party celebrations. In recent years the celebration has been held at the Covenant Eyes global headquarters in Shiawassee County.

It was the selection for the 50th song to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest, and was the 49th edition of Melodifestivalen. Five semi-finals were held in the Swedish cities of Örnsköldsvik, Sandviken, Gothenburg and Malmö, with Örebro hosting the final \"Andra Chansen\" (Second Chance) round.\n\nAfter the five semi-finals 10 songs had qualified to the final of the contest, contested in the Swedish capital of Stockholm, at the Globe Arena. After the voting of 11 juries and a public televote had been revealed, the final winner was Anna Bergendahl with the pop ballad \"This Is My Life\", which received top marks from the public televote, and placing 2nd after the votes of the 11 juries.\n\nThe 2010 Melodifestivalen, as with recent editions of the festival, implemented a number of new rules which changed the dynamics of the contest, including the new \"web wildcard\" competition, held on the SVT website from October to November 2009, selecting the final semi-finalist from submitted entries on the SVT website.\n\nThe current Melodifestivalen rules were first introduced in 2002 – five semi-finals are held every year: the first four semi-finals each with 8 songs, where the top two songs directly qualify to the final of the contest, while the third and fourth-placed songs qualify to the final semi-final, the \"Andra Chansen\" (Second Chance) round. Eight songs compete in the Second Chance round, competing in a knock-out format until two songs are left, which qualify to the final. These songs are chosen by a public televote held on the night of the contest. The final consisted of 10 songs, who are awarded marks by 11 regional juries of Sweden, alongside televoting, with each comprising 50% of the total result.\n\n28 songs are selected from a public call for songs by SVT. These are chosen from a large number of entries, with over 3000 entries being received by SVT in past contests. These songs are reduced by the Swedish Music Publishers Association (\"Svenska musikförläggareföreningen\"; SMFF), who reduce this large number to around 1200 entries. A sixteen-person jury reduce this number once again to the final 28 competing songs. These 28 songs are then joined by compositions by four songwriters invited by SVT, who each submit a song into the competition.\n\nFor the 2010 contest SVT decided to change parts of the format. The duels during the semi-finals introduced in 2008 were abolished. The single \"international jury\" used in 2009, which selected an 11th finalist and voted during the final as a 12th jury, was also abolished. This was replaced by a complete change in the jury voting during the final - instead of 11 regional juries there would be 6 international juries in Russia, Ireland, Norway, Greece, Serbia and France voting on the 10 finalists along with 5 Swedish juries in Luleå, Umeå, Gothenburg, Malmö and Stockholm.\n\n\nSix different cities hosted the six shows of Melodifestivalen, revealed on 27 August 2009. The opening semi-final will be held at the Fjällräven Center in Örnsköldsvik; further semi-finals were held in Sandviken's Göransson Arena, the first time the city has hosted a Melodifestivalen semi-final, the Scandinavium in Gothenburg and the Malmö Arena in Malmö. The Second Chance round was in Örebro's Conventum Arena, while the grand final would be held once again at Globen in Stockholm. There were plans to hold the 2010 final in Gothenburg, however as hockey matches clashed with the date of the final it was necessary to hold the final in Stockholm for the ninth consecutive year.\n\nThe dates for the six shows were announced at the same time, with the first semi-final held on 6 February 2010, with the final of the contest held on 13 March, over six weeks.\n\nThis year's contest was hosted by a trio: comedian Christine Meltzer, three-time Melodifestivalen participant and Eurovision winner in 2015 in Vienna, Måns Zelmerlöw, and actor Dolph Lundgren. The three hosts were revealed at a press conference by SVT on 10 November.\n\nThe Melodifestivalen logo for the Contest, the five spotlights, has been in place since 2002, and remained in use for the 2010 Contest. The first details of the 2010 stage were released on 28 January. For the fourth time, the set was designed by Viktor Brattström, with the intention to provide the feeling of a club environment: \"This year we can present a scene that should evoke the idea of an exclusive club environment. Levels and stairs offers artists the opportunity for action and linking the stage into a place of celebration.\"\n\nThe stage uses different height to allow the artists to use the stage most effectively to create their own number, and extensive use of LED screens to create different moods.\n32 songs competed in Melodifestivalen 2010. 27 of them were selected from a public call for songs, in which public songwriters and artists could send in songs to SVT, until 22 September 2009. Five songs were selected to compete in the contest as wildcards: SVT internally selected four songwriting teams and artists to compete in the contest, to diversify the musical quality of the competition; a final song was selected through a \"web wildcard\" competition, with the Swedish public selecting one song by an unknown act to progress to the semi-finals.\n\nAs since 2004 SVT has specially invited four artists and composers to compete in Melodifestivalen, in order to diversify the musical qualify of the contest. As well as this the 2010 contest introduced a \"web wildcard\" competition, in which songwriters who were not linked to any record companies could publish compositions over two weeks in September and October 2009 on SVT Melodifestivalen website. The winner of the web wildcard was selected by the Swedish public through SMS voting, with the song that received the most votes by 12 November competing in the televised semi-finals.\n\nThe first wildcard competing in Melodifestivalen 2010 was revealed by SVT on 3 November 2009, with Darin selected by SVT to perform in the contest with the song \"Out Of My Life\", written by Tony Nilsson and Henrik Jansson. SVT revealed the winner of the web wildcard contest on 12 November 2009 on SVT's morning news programme \"Gomorron Sverige\". The winning song was \"Come And Get Me Now\", performed by MiSt. On 5 December MiST and Melodifestivalen's producer Christer Björkman approached the band Highlights, a participant in the \"Dansbandskampen\" competition, to join MiSt on stage in Melodifestivalen, which they accepted.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, Salem Al Fakir was announced as the second wildcard participant, and it was announced he would take part with the song \"Keep on Walking\", which he wrote and composed himself. SVT revealed the third wildcard for MF 2010 on 3 December 2009: Peter Jöback was selected by SVT to compete in the competition, where he would sing \"Hollow\", composed by Anders Hansson and Fredrik Kempe.\nSVT's fourth and final wildcard was announced on 7 January 2010. Soul singer Pauline Kamusewu would compete in the second semifinal of Melodifestivalen with the song \"Sucker for Love\", written by herself and Fredrik \"Fredro\" Ödesjö, Andreas Levander and Johan \"Jones\" Wetterberg.\n\nThe first web wildcard contest for Melodifestivalen was held from September to November 2009. This allowed new promising talents a new way to enter Melodifestivalen instead of through the regular public submission process, in which amateur musicians rarely succeeded. Musicians who didn't have or had never had any contract with a music publishing house or never had any of their work published could enter songs onto SVT's Melodifestivalen website from 21 September to 4 October. From 14 October to 12 November 2009, the qualifying songs were voted for by SMS voting in Sweden, with the winning song being decided on 12 November 2009\n\n246 songs were submitted for the web wildcard, with 180 selected to compete in the competition, after disqualifying those that did not meet the rules of the contest. Over the following weeks the bottom songs in the public SMS vote were eliminated from the contest, leaving 10 songs left:\n\n\nOn 4 November the top ten songs were announced by SVT. Each day, until 11 November 2009, one song was eliminated from the competition, with only three songs left. The winner was announced on 12 November at 8:45 am on SVT's morning news programme \"Gomorron Sverige\", with the duo MiSt (Mia Terngård & Stefan Lebert) winning the contest with the song was \"Come and Get Me Now\".\n\nOn 14 October 2009 SVT revealed the first 27 entries which the jury had selected, of a total of 2860 submissions to the contest. However on 15 October 2009, it was announced that \"Never Heard of Him\", composed by Figge Boström and Anna Engh, was disqualified after it appeared briefly on Figge Boström's MySpace page. The song was replaced on 20 October 2009 by \"You're Making Me Hot-Hot-Hot\", written by Tobias Lundgren, Johan Fransson and Tim Larsson.\n\nOn 27 November 2009, the song \"Åt helvete för sent\" was disqualified by the public broadcaster of Sweden, SVT, because the decision on the artist to perform it (Rikard Wolff, Sara Löfgren or Mathias Holmgren) was being obstructed by the team responsible for the song.\nThe entry to replace the disqualified song was the song \"The Saviour\" by Henrik Janson and Tony Nilsson.\n\nThe semi-finals were held this year in Örnsköldsvik, Sandviken, Gothenburg and Malmö. SVT released 13 artists on 30 November 2009 which performed in the first and the second semi-final. On 7 December 2009 a further 14 entries were released, who competed in the third and fourth semi-finals.\n\nSVT announced the running order for the semi-finals on 8 January 2010. Ola Svensson opened the contest in the first semi-final, and wildcard Peter Jöback closed the semi-finals at the fourth semi-final.\n\nNew voting measures in the semi-finals were implemented, with the song receiving the most votes in the first round automatically qualifying to the final, skipping the second round. The remaining top 4 battled again for a place in the final and \"Andra Chansen\" round - the 2nd placed song qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to \"Andra Chansen\".\n\nThe first semi-final was held on 6 February 2010 in Fjällräven Center, Örnsköldsvik. One minute clips of the eight competing songs were released by SVT on 5 February.\n\nThe first semi-final began with a performance by former Melodifestivalen contestants Charlotte Perrelli, Nanne Grönvall and Sonja Aldén of the Bonnie Tyler song \"Holding Out for a Hero\".\n\nThe first performance of the night was by \"Andra Chansen\" participant in Melodifestivalen 2008 Ola Svensson, and his song \"Unstoppable\", an uptempo Europop song. Ola, dressed in casual clothes, was joined by a pianist, and gave a simple performance with effective use of light movement, and later using pyrotechnics.

At the end of the televoting Ola Svensson was selected to progress to the final, while Pain of Salvation and Jessica Andersson qualified to the \"Andra Chansen\" round.\n\nSVT experienced technical problems when broadcasting the first semi-final in high-definition. The first 30 minutes of the show were broadcast in normal resolution, and after this was corrected there was audio interference in HD, which affected the broadcast of \"Road Salt\" over HD. However, SVT chosen to give \"Road Salt\" 10 extra seconds in the first song summary.\n\n2,975,000 watched the first semi-final on SVT, with 446,411 votes cast during the semi-final, giving 1,065,492kr was donated to SVT's charity appeal \"Radiohjälpen\".\n\nThe second semi-final was held on February 13 in Göransson Arena, Sandviken.

Pauline and her backing dancers were all dressed in outfits from the period. Prolific Melodifestivalen competitor Andreas Johnson, taking part in his fourth Melodifestivalen in five years, was next on the Sandviken stage with the song \"We Can Work It Out\". Johnson performed the strong ballad alone on stage in white light and dressed in green.

Martin was a recent graduate of the Wilkes-Barre Business College. On December 17, 1938, she met an unknown man who claimed to be offering her a secretarial job, and was never seen alive again. Her body was discovered in the wilderness away by a hunter four days later. Martin's death resulted in a lengthy manhunt. Numerous suspects were examined, but no one was ever convicted of the crime. As of , it remains an unsolved case and it is unlikely that the perpetrator will ever be discovered.\n\nMargaret Martin was a resident of Kingston, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. She graduated from Kingston High School in 1937. She took classes at the Wilkes-Barre Business College to gain secretarial skills and graduated with honors at the beginning of December 1938. She was 19 years old at the time of her death.\n\nAccording to Betty Hopkins, a former classmate, Martin was \"a shy, studious, friendly girl who had many friends\". Her parents described her as \"a living saint\". She was also a devout Catholic.\n\nMartin's father was John Martin, a local foreman and minor politician. Margaret Martin was the eldest of four children.\n\nOn December 17, 1938, a man contacted Martin, claiming that he was setting up an insurance company and needed a secretary, adding that he had heard of her through the Wilkes-Barre Business College. The two agreed to meet in Kingston Corners, not far from Martin's home.\n\nMartin was first noted to be missing that evening, after she had failed to return home from the alleged job interview. Several witnesses said they had seen her getting into a brown Plymouth or black sedan with a man after a brief conversation. This was the last time she was seen alive. The witnesses were able to give only vague descriptions of the man, described as a \"suave, neat, sandy-haired young man\", and did not identify the car's license plate. The man was between 25 and 30 years of age and slightly overweight. Martin's friends and family called the police and started a search, but her disappearance was difficult to publicize since the local newspapers were on strike.\n\nAccording to a 1999 article in the \"Times Leader\", Martin was tortured and murdered in a sawmill in the mountains about from the creek where her body was found. According to theories by the police, the killer had attempted to dismember her body and destroy it in the mill's firebox, but had been scared off by the mill's owner, James Kedd. Kedd had assumed that the killer was a mere trespasser and had fired a warning shot in the killer's direction. The killer then drove to a point close to the creek and carried Martin's body the final 75 yards to the creek, where he abandoned it.\n\nInitially, it was suspected that Martin's disappearance was linked to a sex slavery ring. However, her body was discovered in the forested wilderness of Northmoreland Township, Wyoming County, on December 21, 1938, about from her home. The discoverer was 19-year-old Anthony Rezykowski, who was trapping muskrats in the area. Rezykowski noticed a large burlap bag partially submerged in of water in a creek. Upon further investigation, he found the bag to contain the mutilated body of a young woman with no clothing. The body was soon identified as Margaret Martin's. At the time of her body's discovery, she had been dead for at least 24 hours. If not for Rezykowski's discovery of her body, it may have gone unnoticed for several years.\n\nMartin's body showed signs of having been beatenperhaps with a rockand strangled. She had bruises on her throat and body, as well as knife wounds on her stomach and thigh. Her autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and stated that she had \"suffered the molestation of a degenerate\".\n\nAfter the discovery of Martin's body, approximately 75 state troopers combed the area in search of clues. However, no tire tracks were seen near the site where her body was found, and the burlap bag proved to be of no use in identifying any suspects. According to \"The Citizens' Voice\", burned cloth matching the clothing Martin was wearing when she was last seen was discovered at an abandoned sawmill near Forkston. However, an article in \"The Kane Republican\" stated that this was not the origin of the cloth. An incident involving a bundle of clothing being thrown from a car near Orwigsburg proved to be unrelated to Martin's killing.\n\nOn December 22, the \"Scranton Tribune\" predicted that Martin's killer would be arrested within 24 hours.\n\nMany hundreds of people attended Martin's funeral at St. Ignatius Church in Kingston on December 24. Plainclothes police officers also attended her funeral in the hopes of noticing anyone suspicious attending.\n\nSeveral theories about the identity of Martin's murderer were suggested by locals. These included a mortician from Wyoming County, a businessman's son who left the area soon after the murder, a local assistant pastor, a teacher at the Wilkes-Barre Business College, and a local teenager who had a crush on Martin. Two men who had attempted to attack a 16-year-old girl from Hanover Township, Luzerne County, were also investigated. Some investigators believed that due to the killer's familiarity with the area's terrain, the killer must have been a local. More recently, it has been suggested that the killer was actually a non-local serial killer.\n\nOn December 28, 1938, Pennsylvania state senator Leo C. Mundy stated that at the next state legislature, he would introduce a bill making sex crimes punishable by execution and requiring registration for all sex offenders. Mundy had resolved to introduce the bill due to Martin's murder. Physicians and welfare and social service workers would also be required to report anyone with tendencies towards such offenses.\n\nBy the beginning of 1939, most clues pertaining to Martin's murder had proven to be useless. The manhunt for the killer was still ongoing in February of that year, but the police had not turned up any more information. In June 1939, further clues were discovered, but the killer was not identified.\n\nAlthough a very large number of suspects were investigated after Martin's death, no perpetrator was ever identified.\n\nIn September 1942, Orban Taylor of New York City confessed to Martin's murder. However, his confession was proven to be false after ten hours of investigation. Taylor was not charged with that crime although he did confess to several other crimes.\n\nIn 1948, a decade after Martin's murder, the case was one of the few major unsolved murders in Pennsylvania. In 1999, Peter Paul Olszewski, Jr., who was at the time the Luzerne County District Attorney, stated that even with modern criminal investigation methods and forensic techniques, it is unlikely that the identity of Martin's killer will be discovered. It is presumed that the killer is now long-deceased.\n\n"}

It is published by the Serb National Council (SNV), the main state-funded body concerned with promotion of human rights and dealing with issues of ethnic identity and participation of Serbs in Croatia. The organization was established in July 1997 in Zagreb, based on the provisions granting the right to self-government for Serbs in Croatia as set in the Erdut Agreement.\n\nThe magazine, billed as an \"independent Serb weekly\" (\"samostalni srpski tjednik\"), describes its editorial policy as being primarily concerned with covering general news and publishing \"critical writing about all the relevant political, social and cultural developments in Croatia\". It also deals with issues related to the Serb community in Croatia and the development of civil society.\n\nThe \"Novosti\" weekly was originally launched by SNV in December 1999 in broadsheet format as a weekly publication primarily concerned with minority politics related to Serbs of Croatia. Since its first issue the magazine adopted a policy of linguistic pluralism and featured articles written in both Croatian and Serbian varieties of Serbo-Croatian, and offered a mix of sections printed in Latin and Cyrillic scripts. However, its circulation was limited to subscribers and was not widely available in newsstands for the first ten years of its existence.\n\nIn late 2009 the magazine underwent an extensive makeover in an effort to transform it into a weekly magazine which would also appeal to the mainstream public, with more space dedicated to commentary pieces and coverage of nationally significant political and cultural events, as well as investigative journalism. To that extent, the magazine hired a number of prominent columnists and intellectuals as commentators, including Viktor Ivančić (formerly of \"Feral Tribune\"), Boris Dežulović, Vladimir Arsenijević, Tomislav Jakić and Igor Mandić, and was for the first time made available for purchase at newsstands.\n\nAs of December 2009 its circulation is 8,000. Its editor-in-chief is Ivica Đikić, formerly of \"Novi list\" daily. Over the time magazine published interviews with Noam Chomsky, Etgar Keret, Zygmunt Bauman, Henry Giroux, Srećko Horvat, Milorad Pupovac, Chris Hedges, Jacques Rancière, Vivek Chibber, Filip David, Georges Wolinski, Mladen Ivanić, Vesna Teršelič, Andrej Nikolaidis, and Mirjana Karanović.\n\nPolitical satire and social commentary are integral part of Novosti editorial policy. This at some points caused strong criticism among some Croatian nationalists with dogmatic views on historical events such as Croatian War of Independence, who saw ridicule of militarism, Croatian military and national symbols as unacceptable excess of limits of freedom of speech. Some of them were calling for cancellation of funding the newspapers from public money, criminal prosecution or censorship. Some mainstream politicians in Croatia, including the president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, warned the editors that they shall take care what they are writing about implicitly calling them to use self-censorship. President stated that she consider journal satire to be inappropriate and similar to cartoons of Muhammad in foreign press such as Charlie Hebdo. On April 4, 2017 Reporters Without Borders condemned \"a campaign of lawsuits and verbal attacks that Croatian nationalist groups have been orchestrating for several months against Novosti, the newspaper of Croatia’s Serbian minority\". Some of the sentences published in Novosti that made part of the Croatian public feel insulted, were following:\n\n\"Asshole Croatia is a national state of assholes and their public service\"\n\n\"\"Scientists brag that they found the reason for existence of an appendix, while for Croatian sovereignty, up to this day, no one knows what it serves for, or does it even exists...\".\"\n\nInitiators of the petition for repeal of the funding refer to the same tender criterium which enabled the funding of Novosti weekly, which states: \"those who promote intolerance towards any national minority or majority, will be banned from contesting on [this] tender in period of 3 years\"\n\n\n"}

The operation was organized on the assumption ZANU-PF would attempt to violently seize the government should it lose the election. ZANU-PF ultimately won the election and Operation Quartz was never executed.\n\nOperation Quartz had two elements. The first involved strikes against armed units of the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA, ZANU-PF's military wing) that had concentrated at 11 assembly points prior to the election, to be carried out by Rhodesian infantry and armour units supported by the Rhodesian Air Force. The second element called for the simultaneous assassinations of Robert Mugabe, Rex Nhongo, and Simon Muzenda by the Rhodesian SAS.\n\nIn addition to the Rhodesian Army and Rhodesian Air Force, it is believed that the South African Armed Forces may have planned a supporting role in Operation Quartz.\n\nSome accounts of Operation Quartz have inaccurately described it as a planned military coup against the extant government of Abel Muzorewa to prevent it from handing over power to Mugabe, alleging Peter Walls called off the operation three hours before H-Hour. The allegations may have originated in dubious information leaked by the British government.\n\nThe ZANU-PF won a majority of votes in the election and Operation Quartz was never executed. Following the ZANU-PF victory, details of Operation Quartz came to light and Walls, who had initially been retained by Mugabe as head of the armed forces, was accused in parliament of treason. On the advice of members of the government, Walls left the country for his own safety.\n"}

The Italian-language libretto was by Paolo Antonio Rolli, after Francesco Briani's \"Isacio tiranno\", set by Antonio Lotti in 1710. Handel wrote the work for the Royal Academy's 1726–27 opera season, and also as homage to the newly crowned George II and the nation where Handel had just received citizenship.\n\n\"Riccardo Primo\" was the third opera Handel composed for the trio of famous star Italian singers, the castrato Senesino and the sopranos Francesca Cuzzoni and Faustina Bordoni.\n\nThe opera received its premiere at the King's Theatre in London on 11 November 1727, and 11 subsequent performances. It was also performed in Hamburg and Braunschweig in February 1729. The Hamburg performance, led by none other than Georg Philipp Telemann, included two new comic characters, Murmilla and Gelasius; recitatives and the added arias for the new characters were translated into German although the original arias remained in Italian. Handel subsequently re-used music from the opera in \"Scipione\" and \"Tolomeo\". The opera fell into neglect after the 1728 closing of the Royal Academy.\n\n\"Riccardo Primo\" was rediscovered and performed by the Handel Opera Society at Sadler's Wells Opera in London on 8 July 1964. Later performances were given at Kourion Amphitheater in Cyprus at 1991, in order to mark the 800th anniversary of the historical events on which the opera is based, at the 1996 Göttingen Festival and at the Händelfestspiele at the Badisches Staatstheater in 2014 and 2015. The work was given its United States premiere, presented as \"Richard the Lionheart\", by Opera Theatre of Saint Louis during the summer 2015 season.\n\nThe story concerns the marriage of Richard I of England to Constanza, a Spanish princess. The character of Costanza is identified with Berengaria of Navarre, who married Richard I at Limassol at 1191.\n[Prior to the action of the opera, Riccardo and Costanza have not yet met.]\n\n\"Cyprus\"\n\nOn her sea journey to be married to Riccardo, Costanza and her party are shipwrecked off the coast of Cyprus. She finds shelter at the court of the local governor, Isacio, pretending that she and her tutor, Berardo, are actually brother and sister, Doride and Narsete, servants of Costanza. Oronte (engaged to Pulcheria) is attracted to 'Doride'. Pulcheria overhears him paying court and is angry. Riccardo arrives, disguised as his kingdom's ambassador, and asks after Costanza. Isacio guesses \"Doride's\" real identity and promises to give up Costanza to Riccardo.\n\nIsacio, knowing that Riccardo has never seen his fiancée, proposes to send his daughter Pulcheria to Riccardo in her stead, leaving the way open for his seduction of Costanza, whom he forces to admit her real identity. Pulcheria agrees, out of duty to her father, but intends to reveal the deception at the right moment. Oronte has discovered Isacio's plot through Berardo and stops it at the moment that Riccardo and Pulcheria meet for the first time, which leads Pulcheria to forgive her fiancé. Riccardo is angry upon learning of Isacio's designs and proposes to overthrow the tyrant in alliance with Oronte. He retains his disguise and plans to offer charity towards Isacio in spite of the ill plotting. Speaking \"on behalf\" of Riccardo, \"the Ambassador\" offers Isacio the choice of either peace or war. Pulcheria pleads for Costanza and Isacio agrees to bestow her on Riccardo. Pulcheria introduces Riccardo, initially as the 'ambassador, but then revealed as his true self, to Costanza, and act 2 closes with a love duet for Costanza and Riccardo.\n\nRiccardo tells Oronte how Isacio has gone back on his word and launched an attack against Riccardo at the moment that he was about to leave with Costanza. Despite the help of Oronte's forces, Costanza is taken back by Isacio. Pulcheria, seeing the captive Costnza's distress, offers herself as a hostage to Riccardo's forces. Isacio offers his prisoner his hand in marriage and his throne. Berardo intervenes to announce the renewed approach of the English army. Isacio is defiant. As Riccardo bursts into the palace, Isacio threatens to kill Costanza. As Riccardo is about to concede, Pulcheria seizes a sword and announces she will kill herself if Costanza is harmed. In the following confusion Oronte enters and his superior forces prompt Isacio to flee. The women are left alone to hope for a just victory for Riccardo and Oronte returns to announce that the English king has been victorious. Riccardo dispenses justice as follows. Isacio must renounce his power, but is allowed to live. Pulcheria, with Oronte as her husband, shall reign in place of her father.\n\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had introduced Italian opera for the first time with his opera \"Rinaldo\". A tremendous success, \"Rinaldo\" created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. In 1719, Handel was appointed music director of an organisation called the Royal Academy of Music (unconnected with the present-day London conservatoire), a company under royal charter to produce Italian operas in London. Handel was not only to compose operas for the company but hire the star singers, supervise the orchestra and musicians, and adapt operas from Italy for London performance.\n\nHandel had composed numerous Italian operas for the Academy, with varying degrees of success; some were enormously popular. The castrato Senesino and the soprano Francesca Cuzzoni had appeared in a succession of Handel operas for the Academy (he was not the only composer who composed operas for the company) most of which had been successful with audiences, and in 1726 the directors of the Academy brought over another internationally renowned singer, Faustina Bordoni, to add to the company's attractions. The two prima donnas had appeared in continental European countries in operas together without incident, but in London they developed rival groups of fans who interrupted the performances with rowdy displays of partisanship for one lady or another. This came to a climax on 6 June 1727 during a performance at the King's Theatre of \"Astianatte\" by Giovanni Bononcini with both singers onstage and royalty in the audience. Fist fights and disorder between rival groups of fans broke out in the audience and the two sopranos exchanged insults and came to blows onstage. The rest of the opera was cut, the performers going straight to the short final chorus. The scandal was gleefully repeated in the newspapers, in satirical skits on other stages, and in mock-heroic verse, bringing the entire form of Italian opera into a certain amount of disrepute in London.\n\nHandel had to supply another opera for the trio of star singers, Senesino, Cuzzoni and Faustina (as she was known) even though these singers received astronomical fees, much more than he received for composing the works. Combined with declining audience numbers caused at least in part by the ridicule brought upon Italian opera by the rival sopranos' public spat, these factors were causing severe financial difficulty for the Royal Academy of Music. As one of Handel's most loyal supporters, Mary Delaney, wrote in 1727:\nI doubt operas will not survive longer than this winter, they are now at their last gasp; the subscription is expired and nobody will renew it. The directors are all squabbling, and they have so many divisions among themselves that I wonder they have not broke up before. Senesino goes away next winter, and I believe Faustina, so you see harmony is almost out of fashion.\n\nThe Royal Academy of Music collapsed at the end of the 1728–29 season, partly due to the huge fees paid to the star singers, and Cuzzoni and Faustina both left London for engagements in continental Europe. Handel started a new opera company with a new prima donna, Anna Strada. One of Handel's librettists, Paolo Rolli, wrote in a letter (the original is in Italian) that Handel said that Strada \"sings better than the two who have left us, because one of them (Faustina) never pleased him at all and he would like to forget the other (Cuzzoni).\"\n\nThe opera was not revived by Handel, although to 18th century musicologist Charles Burney it contained much fine music, including an aria for Faustina, \"Vado per obedirti\", which: \nis the most agreeable song of execution of the times. I have been told that the brilliancy of her voice made its way through the busy accompaniment of this song in a manner which filled the whole theatre. A close in this air appears for the first time, which has since become fashionable, as well as the return to the subject in the Da Capo.\nR.B. Chatwin has discussed Handel's writing of orchestral parts for the chalumeau, a forerunner of the clarinet, as part of the musicological controversy over whether or not Handel wrote music for the clarinet or its precursors. Winton Dean and Richard Drakeford have commented on the weaknesses of the dramatic characterisations in the libretto.\n\nThe opera is scored for recorder, flute, bass flute or two chalumeaux, two oboes, bassoon, three trumpets, two horns, timpani, strings and continuo (cello, lute, harpsichord).\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\n"}
{"id": "13014945", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13014945", "title": "Singapore National Day Rally", "text": "Singapore National Day Rally\n\nThe National Day Rally (Chinese: 国庆群众大会, ) is an annual address that the Prime Minister of Singapore makes to the entire nation, on the first or second Sunday after National Day on 9 August. A yearly event since 1966, the Prime Minister uses the rally to address the nation on its key challenges and announce major policy changes, and is comparable to the State of the Union address delivered by the President of the United States.\n\nThe rally began in 1966 as a \"private meeting\" between the Prime Minister and community leaders. The transcript was released to the media only two weeks later. Only in 1971 did Lee Kuan Yew decide \"at the last minute\" to televise the speech, which has since been annually broadcast live.\n\nThe first rally in 1966 was held on the eve of National Day. Since 1967, the rally has been held at least a week after National Day.\n\nThe rally was delivered at the former National Theatre from 1966 to 1983. With the theatre's closure and demolishment in 1984, the rally was held at the Singapore Conference Hall for two years before being shifted to Kallang Theatre from 1986 to 2000. In 2001, the rally moved to the University Cultural Centre at the National University of Singapore. Since 2013, Lee Hsien Loong has held his rally at the ITE Headquarters and ITE College Central.\n\nThe first National Day Rally was held on 8 August 1966 at the National Theatre. A closed-door meeting, Lee Kuan Yew told community leaders, \"Every year, on this 9th August for many years ahead - how many, I do not know - we will dedicate ourselves anew to consolidate ourselves to survive; and, most important of all, to find an enduring future for what we have built and what our forebears will build up.\"\n\nThe 1971 rally was the first to be televised, at Lee Kuan Yew's \"last minute\" decision. Since then, the rally has become \"a fixture on the political calendar\".\n\nLee delivered his \"cautiously optimistic\" speech \"off the cuff\", remarking, \"You have done well - six superb years, a magnificent performance against all the odds, so much so that everybody says, 'But, of course, everybody knows that Singapore is a very well-endowed place...Oh, just natural course of events.' It wasn't, you know. We made it so...\"\n\nThe 1981 rally marked the first time where Cabinet ministers delivered their speeches.\n\nAt the 1983 rally, Lee Kuan Yew \"trotted out facts and figures to show that the more highly educated a woman was, the less likely she was to reproduce\", before concluding, \"[W]e are really discarding our able parents in the next generation and doubling the less able.\" The resulting controversy eroded electoral support for his People's Action Party for several years.\n\nIn 1988, Lee Kuan Yew delivered \"one of his most quoted lines\": \"And even from my sick bed, even if you are going to lower me into the grave, and I feel that something is going wrong, I'll get up.\"\n\nIn 1991, Goh Chok Tong delivered his maiden speech at the National Day Rally. He \"spoke with a self-deprecating humour that heralded a new, gentler style of governance\", which he underscored by remarking, \"I am not going to follow [Lee Kuan Yew's] act. I am going to walk my own way.\"\n\nAt the 2002 rally, Goh Chok Tong remarked, \"Fair-weather Singaporeans will run away whenever the country runs into stormy weather. I call them 'quitters'. Fortunately, 'quitters' are in the minority. The majority of Singaporeans are 'stayers'...As we say in Hokkien, 'pah see buay zao'.\" His labels generated \"much discussion\".\n\nIn 2004, Lee Hsien Loong made his maiden address at the National Day Rally. However, rather than deliver a \"cautious speech\", he \"surprised many by slaughtering a few sacred cows\". He promoted a new \"teach less, learn more\" education policy, introduced a shortened five-day work week for the Civil Service, and, most controversially, mooted the idea of casinos in Singapore. In 1970, Lee Kuan Yew's response to casinos in Singapore had been \"no, not over my dead body\", though the elder Lee had since changed his mind.\n\nIn 2005, Lee Hsien Loong adopted the current format of delivering his Malay and Chinese remarks at 6:45 pm, with a break at 7:30 pm, before commencing his English address at 8:00pm. Prior to 2005, the rally was a continuous speech from 8:00pm.\n\nIn 2007, opposition and Nominated Members of Parliament were invited to the National Day Rally for the first time.\n\nIn 2008, the English language telecast of the rally, initially scheduled for live broadcast at 8pm on 17 August, was postponed to the next day. The move was to allow Singaporeans to watch Singapore take on China in the women's table tennis finals at the Beijing Olympics. The rally itself proceeded as usual at the University Cultural Centre, but was only broadcast the next day.\n\nIn 2009, Singaporeans used the Twitter hashtag #ndrsg to tweet about the rally.\n\nThe 2010 rally was held on the last Sunday of August to avoid clashing with the Youth Olympic Games earlier that month.\n\nThe 2012 rally marked the second time where Cabinet ministers delivered their speeches at 6.45pm, before the Prime Minister's remarks at 8pm. It was also the first to feature sign-language translation in real time. It was held on the last Sunday of August to facilitate Ramadan festivities.\n\nThe 2013 rally was the first to be held at the ITE Headquarters and ITE College Central after nine years at the National University of Singapore's University Cultural Centre. Lee said the move was \"for a serious purpose - to underscore my longstanding commitment to investing in…every Singaporean\".\n\nIn his 2015 speech, \"set within the context of...an impending general election\", Lee Hsien Loong \"asked for a strong mandate\" without being \"baldly partisan\". Lee also mentioned two ministers, Vivian Balakrishnan and Lim Swee Say, who would respectively be standing in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC and East Coast GRC, the two most contested PAP-held constituencies.\n\nAn hour and 20 minutes into his English remarks at the 2016 rally, Lee Hsien Loong suddenly took ill at 9.20pm. Half an hour later, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean announced that Lee would resume his speech. The Prime Minister's Office also said that Lee had felt \"unsteady because of prolonged standing, heat and dehydration\", adding, \"His heart is fine and he did not have a stroke.\" At 10.40pm, he returned to speak for another 15 minutes. By then, he looked well and thanked the audience for waiting for him, who gave him a standing ovation.\n\nThe 2017 rally was held on 20 August 2017 at ITE College Central. Lee's speech mainly focused on the obstacles which Singapore was currently facing, namely Diabetes, Pre-school and Technology. \n\nThe 2018 rally was held at the ITE College Central on 19 August 2018, with the rally focused on trending issues such as housing, healthcare and cost of living. Lee introduced, among other policies, the Merdeka Generation Package (a spin-off from the Pioneer Generation Package), the Voluntary Early Redevelopment Scheme and a revamped Home Improvement Programme. He also announced that Singapore would be seeking a second inscription on UNESCO's World Heritage List of her hawker culture, and that Senior Minister of State and Mayor Maliki Osman would be leading an improvement project for Geylang Serai.\n\nThe programme used to be aired as a single slot programme from 8 pm onwards. Since 2005, the rally is usually broadcast live from 6.45pm till 10pm (SST), with a break between 7.30pm and 8pm (the break was extended to 8.15 pm from 2017 onwards), across MediaCorp channels. However, most English rallies were over-run and most programmes on MediaCorp had postponed to the following week but some programmes were shown immediately after the English rally. Most programmes on MediaCorp would resume earlier at 9:30pm or later at 11:00pm if the rally over-ran the scheduled time.\nFrom 2001 to 2004, the rally was also broadcast on the now-defunct SPH MediaWorks' channels.\n\nTranscripts of the rally speech are usually available for viewing after the event at MediaCorp news portals, Singapore Press Holdings news portals, the website of the Prime Minister's Office and the online press centre of the Government of Singapore. Highlights of the speeches will usually be reported by Singapore newspapers in the following days.\n\nAn article titled \"Singapore's National Day Rally Speech: A Site of Ideological Negotiation\" analyses the inaugural National Day Rally speeches of three Singapore prime ministers. It locates these speeches in the continuous ideological work that the People's Action Party (PAP) government has to do to maintain consensus and forge new alliances among classes and social forces that are being transformed by globalisation. Increasingly, these speeches have had to deal with the contradictions between nation-building and the tensions between the liberal and reactionary tendencies of the global city.\n\nAccording to Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew school of Public Policy:\n\"The rally speech has also been a part of larger celebrations surrounding the commemoration of Singapore's independence gained on 9th August 1965. These celebrations have come to include a short and formal televised National Day message from the Prime Minister, observance ceremonies held at organizations in the public and private sectors, constituency dinners and ministerial speeches, regularly televised music videos of patriotic songs composed for the celebrations, and - most spectacular of all - a National Day parade that since the mid-1980s has included not only a traditional ceremonial segment , but also high-tech mass performances and re-enactments of the official \"Singapore Story\" that end on a climax of fireworks (Kong and Yeoh, 1997). Clearly the symbolic and formal aspects of the speech are just as important as its contents, taking Singaporeans collectively to an emotional high. This is especially so during general election years, when the prime minister announces the PAP's \"report card\" of achievements in government as well as the distribution of election \"goodies\" to the Singaporean masses - the lower income voters in particular - as a way of reinforcing the image of government as benevolent provider.\"\n\n\"As an annual injection of patriotism, the National Day celebrations help to inoculate Singaporeans against the disenchantment that accompanies advanced industrial societies, whether they are formally classified as capitalist or socialist, democratic or authoritarian. Singaporeans are reminded every year of the PAP's pioneer leaders - Lee Kuan yew and his \"lieutenants\" (Lam and Tan,1999) - who have been written into the official \"Singapore Story\" as the brave and far-sighted founders of contemporary Singapore (Loh,1998). Both volumes of Lee's own memoirs - tellingly titled \"the Singapore Story\" - have become central texts of the Singapore Story, supplemented by glossy publications such as the National Heritage Boards (1998) \"Singapore: Journey Into nationhood\" as well as other educational and information materials\"\n\n\"The PAP knows that its authority will be secure as long as it remains able to make Singaporeans believe that it can continue to deliver material prosperity and security for all, regardless of race. Therefore, the PAP has had to reassert its relevance constantly by insisting on Singapore's fundamentally vulnerable nature and condition, an insistence that has sustained a culture of fear and arrested the risky global environment, the PAP also knows that the transactional basis on which its authority is built has become fragile and therefore needs to be strengthened by moral authority, what Burns (1978) has identified as a transformative mode of leadership, through which it can uplift, inspire and motivate in times of real crisis.\"\n\n"}

The accident killed 77 people and injured 543, 100 of whom were hospitalised. , it was the deadliest air show accident in history.\n\nMore than 10,000 spectators attended the Saturday air show, staged to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the Ukrainian Air Force's 14th Air Corps. The Su-27 aircraft was flown by two experienced pilots; it entered a rolling maneuver at 12:52 p.m. with a downward trajectory at low altitude. It rolled upright once more and was still descending rapidly when the left wing dropped shortly before it hit the ground, at which point the crew initiated ejection. The aircraft flattened out initially, skidding over the ground towards stationary aircraft and striking a glancing blow against the nose of an Ilyushin Il-76 transport aircraft before beginning to explode and cartwheel into the crowd of spectators.\n\nBoth pilots survived with minor injuries, while 77 spectators were killed, including 28 children (though initial reports by the Emergency Situations Ministry put the number of dead at 83, including 23 children). Another 100 were hospitalized for head injuries, burns, and bone fractures. Other injuries were less severe and did not require hospitalization; a total of 543 people were injured during the accident.\n\nFollowing the disaster, the pilots stated that the flight map which they had received differed from the actual layout. On the cockpit voice recorder, one pilot asks, \"And where are our spectators?\" Others have suggested that the pilots were slow to react to automated warnings issued by the flight computer.\n\nUkrainian President Leonid Kuchma publicly blamed the military for the disaster and dismissed head of the air force, General Viktor Strelnykov. Defense minister Volodymyr Shkidchenko sent in his resignation, but Kuchma rejected it.\n\nOn 24 June 2005, a military court sentenced pilot Volodymyr Toponar and co-pilot Yuriy Yegorov to 14 and 8 years in prison, respectively. The court found the two pilots and three other military officials guilty of failing to follow orders, negligence, and violating flight rules. Two of the three officials were sentenced to up to six years in prison, and the last official received up to four years. In addition, Toponar was ordered to pay 7.2 million Ukrainian hryvnia (US$1.42 million; €1.18 million) in compensation to the families, and Yegorov 2.5 million hryvnia. The crew's main flight trainer was acquitted for lack of evidence. After the verdict was announced, Toponar said that he planned to appeal, insisting that the crash was due to technical problems and a faulty flight plan. Yegorov was released in 2008 after President Yushchenko issued a decree reducing his sentence to three and a half years.\n\nThe pilots were assigned the majority of the blame, which included accusations of attempting maneuvers with which they were not experienced. Toponar had requested an additional training flight at the airfield where the display was to be performed; this request was denied.\n\n\n"}

It features seminars, events, speeches by prominent people in the LGBT community, numerous vendors catering to transgender and transsexual people, and more, and is known as the largest, most famous, and pre-eminent such conference in the United States. The organization offers scholarships to some attendees.\n\nThe conference provided the title for and is featured heavily in the 2001 documentary \"Southern Comfort\", about the life and death of Robert Eads, whose goal in 1998 was to live long enough to attend the conference. Eads succeeded, and his speech at the conference is featured in the documentary. In honor of the memory of Eads, the conference offers health exams through the annual \"Robert Eads Health Project\" in collaboration with the Trans Health Initiative at the Feminist Women's Health Center.\n\nThe conference has built a reputation as a safe place for LGBT people with a familial atmosphere, and aims at inclusiveness. It attracts people from all over the United States, offering the opportunity for social and other interaction.\nFrom the conference's founding in 1991 until 2014, the conference was held in Atlanta, Georgia. At the conclusion of the 2014 Southern Comfort Conference, the board of directors announced that SCC 2015-2017 will be held in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\n\nWith support from the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitor Bureau, the 2017 conference was to be held from September 14–17 at The Riverside Hotel in Fort Lauderdale However it was cancelled because of Hurricane Irma. The 2018 conference is to be held from September 6-8.\n\n"}
{"id": "1881899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1881899", "title": "Southern Decadence", "text": "Southern Decadence\n\nSouthern Decadence is an annual six-day event held in New Orleans, Louisiana by the gay and lesbian community during Labor Day Weekend, climaxing with a parade through the French Quarter on the Sunday before Labor Day.\n\nThe event traces its beginnings to August 1972, as a party among a group of 40–50 friends both straight and gay. They billed their event as \"Southern Decadence Party: Come As Your Favorite Southern Decadent.\" People who attended were required to dress as their favorite decadent Southerner. The first small \"parade\" occurred the following year, when the participants first met at Johnny Matassa's Bar in the French Quarter to show off their costumes and then walk back home in the Tremé neighborhood via Esplanade Avenue. This first group impersonated people and characters ranging from Belle Watling (the prostitute character in \"Gone With the Wind\") and Mary Ann Mobley to Tallulah Bankhead and Helen Keller. The event expanded with Frederick Douglas Wright, an African American, appointed as the first Grand Marshal by members of the original group in 1974, who would have complete control over the parade of incredible characters and costumes as they marched through the French Quarter.\n\nDecadence, as it is commonly known by participants, is marked by parades, bead tossing, street parties and dance parties. In these ways it resembles New Orleans Mardi Gras, however, Southern Decadence tends to be more sexual in tone and is generally geared towards more upscale and mature revelers. Decadence crowds in the Quarter typically match or exceed Mardi Gras crowds. Most events take place in or around the French Quarter neighborhood centered at the intersection of Bourbon and St. Ann streets.\n\nCrowds range from 100,000 to 300,000 revelers from across the nation and world. In 2017, there were over 200,000 participants and the positive economic impact on the City of New Orleans was estimated at over $250 million. \n\nDecadence caters primarily to gay men, but is still lesbian friendly. Dykes on Bikes participate in the annual parade in the French Quarter and Dykeadence sponsors several events for lesbians.\n\nThemes were presented on and off from the beginning, but did not become a consistent fixture of the event until \"Plagues, Pests, Parasites\" theme in 1988. They have been featured every year that the Decadence has been held since then. They have ranged from themes as varied as \"Voodoo That You Do\", \"Menage à Trois\", \"Ancient Truths, Lies, and Sacrifice\", and \"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back.\"\n\nThe theme for 2018 is \"House of Bourbon -- Unleash Your Beast.\" The official colors are Royal Blue and Canary Yellow. \n\nIn years past, religious and conservative groups have rallied against the festival. In 2003 there was a formal petition filed to have the event terminated, with video footage handed over to officials depicting dozens of men engaged in \"public sex acts\". There were examples of men exposing themselves to others for beads, similar to the way women have long exposed their breasts for the traditional Mardi Gras balcony bead toss. The complaints led to a vocal response from business owners and hoteliers in New Orleans, in support of the festival. Ultimately the police posted notices clarifying what constitutes public sex. The pastor who spearheaded, videotaped, and filed the petition, Grant Storms was arrested in February 2011 after being caught masturbating in a public park. He was convicted of obscenity on August 22, 2012.\n\nThe city later passed an ordinance that effectively banned the dissemination of any social, political, or religious message on Bourbon Street from sunrise to sunset, punishable by up to six months in jail and a $500 fine. City Councilwoman Kristin Palmer, who sponsored the ordinance, said the city \"has a legitimate interest in protecting residents and visitors in the highly trafficked area of Bourbon Street at night. She said aggressive solicitation can be a crowd-control issue, and people are allowed under the law to speak their messages if they take five steps off Bourbon Street. This is really an issue of trying to protect public safety.\" \n\nNine preachers and activists were subsequently arrested on September 1, 2012, after they allegedly yelled slurs at people attending Southern Decadence on Bourbon Street. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union during the first round of their case, those arrested saw the law temporarily suspended via a restraining order that was granted by a federal judge.\n\nIn the year 2005, that year's edition of Southern Decadence was officially canceled in the wake of safety precautions against Hurricane Katrina. However, a very small group of residents who still remained in the French Quarter celebrated the event anyway. An abbreviated parade took place in the French Quarter with some two dozen participants. Most were French Quarter hold-outs; there were also at least a couple of people who had to wade in through flooded streets from other neighborhoods to get there. As the city was officially being evacuated at the time, a police officer at first attempted to stop the small observation of tradition, but one of the participants was able to produce the parade permit issued pre-Katrina showing it was a scheduled legal event, and the small procession was allowed to continue. National media reporters noted the event. It was the first parade in New Orleans after the hurricane, the most recent previous New Orleans parade having been the Krewe of OAK \"Midsummer Mardi Gras\" parade the night before the city's mandatory evacuation.\n\nWith the theme \"Southern Decadence Rebirth\", the event rebounded in 2006, attracting near-normal crowds.\n\nDue to the approach of Hurricane Gustav in 2008 and a mandatory evacuation notice, some events on Saturday and all official Southern Decadence events after Sunday, August 31 midday were canceled that year. As a result of Sunday's parade being canceled, the 2008 Southern Decadence Grand Marshals, Paloma (Samson Utley) and Tittie Toulouse (Gary Delaune), returned for 2009. However, as was the case with 2005, a small group of French Quarter residents still celebrated the 2008 event anyway with an \"unofficial\" parade taking place once again in the French Quarter. That parade had some two-dozen participants, just like three years earlier.\n\nWith the theme \"Hurricane: This Year, They Blow Back\", the event once again rebounded as a whole in 2009, attracting near-normal crowds.\n\n"}
{"id": "29079", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29079", "title": "Statute of frauds", "text": "Statute of frauds\n\nThe statute of frauds refers to the requirement that certain kinds of contracts be memorialized in writing, signed by the party to be charged, with sufficient content to evidence the contract.\n\nTraditionally, the statute of frauds requires a signed writing in the following circumstances:\n\nIn an action for specific performance of a contract to convey land, the agreement must be in writing to satisfy the statute of frauds. The statute is satisfied if the contract to convey is evidenced by a writing or writings containing the essential terms of a purchase and sale agreement and signed by the party against whom the contract is to be enforced. If there is no written agreement, a court of equity can specifically enforce an oral agreement to convey only if the part performance doctrine is satisfied. In most jurisdictions, part performance is proven when the purchaser pays the purchase price, has possession of the land and makes improvements on the land, all with the permission of the seller. No jurisdiction is satisfied by payment of the purchase price alone.\n\nUnder common law, the statute of frauds also applies to contract modifications. For example, in an oral agreement for the lease of a car for nine months, immediately after taking possession, the lessor then decides that he really likes the car and makes an oral offer to the lessee to extend the term of the lease by an additional six months. Although neither agreement alone comes under the statute of frauds, the oral extension modifies the original contract to make it a fifteen-month lease (nine months plus the additional six), thereby bringing it under the statute as the contract now exceeds twelve months in duration. In theory, the same principle works in reverse as well, such that an agreement to reduce a lease from fifteen months to nine months would not require a writing. However, many jurisdictions have enacted statutes that require a writing for such situations.\n\nThe term \"statute of frauds\" comes from an Act of the Parliament of England (29 Chas. 2 c. 3) passed in 1677 (authored by Lord Nottingham assisted by Sir Matthew Hale, Sir Francis North and Sir Leoline Jenkins. and passed by the Cavalier Parliament), the title of which is An Act for Prevention of Frauds and Perjuries. Many common law jurisdictions have made similar statutory provisions, while a number of civil law jurisdictions have equivalent legislation incorporated into their civil codes. The original English statute itself may still be in effect in a number of Canadian provinces, depending on the constitutional or reception statute of English law, and any subsequent legislative developments.\n\nA defendant in a contract case who wants to use the statute of frauds as a defense must raise it as an affirmative defense in a timely manner. The burden of proving that a written contract exists comes into play only when a statute of frauds defense is raised by the defendant.\n\nAn agreement may be enforced even if it does not comply with the statute of frauds in the following situations:\n\nIn the United States, for contracts for the sale of goods that fall under the Uniform Commercial Code, additional exceptions may apply:\n\nThe Statute of Frauds recites that it was enacted for the \". . . prevention of many fraudulent practices which are commonly endeavored to be upheld by perjury . . .\". The mischief arising from claimants asserting oral agreements was to be avoided by requiring that certain contracts be evidenced by \"some memorandum or note thereof . . . in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith . . .\". Contracts respecting land \"created by livery and seisen only or by parole\" would not be enforced absent such a writing.\n\nIt quickly became apparent to the common law judges that the Statute might itself become an instrument of fraud (or at least injustice) if it was strictly enforced with respect to contracts that were wholly or partly performed.\n\nThe courts developed the concept of \"part performance\" as an exception. If a contract concerning land was partly performed, that could displace the need for a note or memorandum in writing signed by the party to be charged.\n\nIt was one thing to create an exception that displaced the need for a memorandum in writing, but something else to completely nullify the Statute's operation. The thrust of the Statute was that contracts concerning land could not be proved by parol evidence alone. Thus, part performance might be an exception, but it could not, in effect, mean that the underlying contract could be proven by parol evidence. In developing the \"part performance\" exception, a balancing of the competing considerations was required. An important factor in the case law became that the part performance must be \"unequivocally\" related to the alleged contract.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds was passed in 1695 in Ireland. The statute is one of the few pre-Independence laws that survived the Statute Law Revision (Pre-1922) Act 2005 and the Statute Law Revision Act 2007, and remains largely in force today.\n\nSome effects of the law have been softened by equity, for example the requirement that all contracts for sale of land be evidenced in writing can be circumvented by reliance on the doctrine of part performance.\n\nThe Statute of Frauds (1677) was largely repealed in England and Wales by the Law Reform (Enforcement of Contracts) Act 1954 (2 & 3 Eliz 2 c 34). The only provision of it extant is part of Section 4 which means that contracts of guarantee (surety for another's debt) are unenforceable unless evidenced in writing. This requirement is clarified by section 3 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act 1856 (19 & 20 Vict 97) which provides that the consideration for the guarantee need not appear in writing or by necessary inference from a written document.\n\nSection 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828 (9 Geo 4 c 14) (commonly known as Lord Tenterden's Act) was enacted to prevent Section 4 being circumvented by bringing an action against a verbal guarantor for the tort of deceit (the tort in \"Freeman v. Palsey\"). A common summary of the law is \"a verbal guarantee (for a debt) isn't worth the paper it is written on\".\n\nProvisions in section 4 as to formalities for contracts for the sale of land were repealed by Schedule 7 to the Law of Property Act 1925 (15 Geo 5 c 20), however the requirement that contracts for the sale of land be evidenced in writing was maintained by section 40 of that Act, subsequently replaced by section 2 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989 (c 34).\n\nSection 6 of the Mercantile Law Amendment Act Scotland 1856 was derived from those parts of section 4 of the Statute of Frauds (1677) which relate to contracts of guarantee and from section 6 of the Statute of Frauds Amendment Act 1828.\n\nIt was repealed on 1 August 1995 by the Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995, sections 14(2) and Schedule 5 (with ss. 9(3)(5)(7), 13, 14(3)).\n\nEvery state has a statute that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing and signed by the party to be charged. The most common requirements are for contracts that involve the sale or transfer of land, and contracts that cannot be completed within one year. When the statute of frauds applies, a typical statute requires that the writing commemorating the agreement identify the contracting parties, recite the subject matter of the contract so that it is reasonably identifiable, and include the important terms and conditions of agreement.\n\nThe statute of frauds in various states comes in three types:\n\nIn addition to the statute of frauds as conventionally defined, the State of Texas has two rules that govern the litigation process, each of which also has the character of a statute of frauds. One is a rule of general applicability and requires agreements between counsel (or a party, if self-represented) to be in writing to be enforceable. Tex. R. Civ. P. 11.\n\nAgreements under this rule are called \"Rule 11 Agreements\" and may either concern settlement or any procedural aspect, such as an agreement regarding scheduling, continuances of trial settings, or discovery matters. The rule has existed since 1840 and has contained the filing requirement since 1877. The number designation can cause confusion to non-Texas attorneys because the federal rule 11 is the sanctions rule, whose state-court counterpart has the number designation 13 under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure (TRCP).\n\nThe other rule that is in the nature of a statute of frauds governs fee agreements with clients when the attorney is to be compensated based on the outcome of the case. The Texas Government Code requires that \"[a] contingent fee contract for legal services must be in writing and signed by the attorney and client.\" TEX. GOV'T CODE ANN. § 82.065(a). \nThe classic example is a contingent fee contract in a personal injury case that provides for the claimant's lawyer to receive a certain percentage of the settlement amount (or of the amount awarded by judgment) net of litigation costs, with the percentages typically staggered and increasing based on whether a settlement was obtained before lawsuit is filed, after a lawsuit was filed but before trial, or whether a judgment favorable to the client was obtained through trial. The other scenario is a contingency fee contract based on cost savings achieved (for a client who is a defendant sued for a money judgment) or based on other specified litigation objectives. In those cases, the client will not recover any money from his opponent in the lawsuit, and will have to pay his attorney from his or her own funds in accordance with the terms of the agreement, once the matter is concluded favorably. When the client does not pay, some attorneys then sue the client on the contingency fee contract, or in quantum meruit in the alternative. See, e.g., Shamoun & Norman, LLP v. Hill, 483 S.W.3d 767 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2016), reversed on other grounds by Hill v. Shamoun & Norman, LLP, No. 16-0107 (Tex. April 13, 2018). The attorney-vs-client fee-dispute issue generally does not arise in personal injury cases because the settlement funds from the settling party or judgment-debtor are disbursed through the attorney of the party entitled to them, net of costs and the contingency fee component.\n\nIn addition to general statutes of frauds, under Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), every state except Louisiana has adopted an additional statute of frauds that relates to the sale of goods. Pursuant to the UCC, contracts for the sale of goods where the price equals $500 or more fall under the statute of frauds, with the exceptions for professional merchants performing their normal business transactions, and for any custom-made items designed for one specific buyer.\n\nThe application of the statute of frauds to dealings between merchants has been modified by provisions of the UCC. There is a \"catch-all\" provision in the UCC for personal property not covered by any other specific law, stating that a contract for the sale of such property where the purchase price exceeds $500 is not enforceable unless memorialized by a signed writing. The most recent UCC revision increases the triggering point for the UCC Statute of Frauds to $5,000, but states have been slow to amend their versions of the statute to increase the trigger point.\n\nFor purposes of the UCC, a defendant who admits the existence of the contract in his pleadings, under oath in a deposition or affidavit, or at trial, may not use the statute of frauds as a defense. However, a statute of frauds defense may still be available under a state's the general statute.\n\nWith respect to securities transactions, the Uniform Commercial Code has abrogated the statute of frauds. The drafters of the most recent revision commented that \"with the increasing use of electronic means of communication, the statute of frauds is unsuited to the realities of the securities business.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "26349646", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26349646", "title": "Theophobos", "text": "Theophobos\n\nTheophobos () or Theophobus, originally Nasir (), Nasr (), or Nusayr (), was an Iranian commander of the Khurramites who converted to Christianity and entered Byzantine service under Emperor Theophilos (r. 829–843). Raised to high rank and married into the imperial family, Theophobos was given command of his fellow Khurramites and served under Theophilos in his wars against the Abbasid Caliphate in 837–838. After the Byzantines' defeat at the Battle of Anzen, he was proclaimed emperor by his own men, but did not pursue this claim. Instead he peacefully submitted to Theophilos in the next year and was apparently pardoned, until he was executed by the dying emperor in 842 to prevent a challenge to the accession of Michael III.\n\nTheophobos was born to a family originally belonging to the Iranian aristocracy. He was originally a member of the Khurramite sect in western Iran, which was being persecuted by the Abbasid Caliphate. In October/November 833, they were defeated by the armies of Caliph al-Mu'tasim (r. 833–842) under Ishaq ibn Ibrahim. Thus, in 834, Nasr with some fourteen thousand other Khurramites, crossed the Armenian highland and fled to the Byzantine Empire. There, they converted to Christianity, were given widows from military families as wives, and enrolled into the Byzantine army in the so-called \"Persian \"tourma\"\". Nasr, now baptized Theophobos (\"fearful/respectful of God\"), was placed at the head of these troops, raised to the rank of \"patrikios\" and given the hand of either Theophilos's sister or a sister of Empress Theodora in marriage. The addition of the \"Persian\" corps greatly strengthened the Byzantine military: not only were its members implacable enemies of the Arabs, but they may have raised the number of effectives in the Byzantine army by as much as a sixth.\n\nAlready in 837, Theophobos and the new Khurramite corps campaigned with Theophilos in his campaign in the region of the Upper Euphrates around Melitene, where they brutally sacked the city of Zapetra. In September of the same year, some 16,000 more Khurramites fled into the Byzantine Empire, following the final suppression of their movement by the Abbasid army.\n\nTheophobos also participated in the campaign of 838 against al-Mu'tasim's retaliatory invasion. He was present at the catastrophic Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Anzen, where he according to some accounts saved the emperor's life (other accounts credit Manuel the Armenian with the feat). In the aftermath of the battle, however, the \"Persian\" troops assembled at Sinope and declared Theophobos emperor, most likely against his will. The exact reason behind this move or the exact sequence of events are unclear. However, after the defeat at Anzen, the rumour had spread to Constantinople that Theophilos had been killed, and it appears that Theophobos, who was possibly an iconodule (as opposed to the staunchly iconoclast Theophilos) was suggested by some among the Byzantine Empire's elite as the new emperor.\nDespite being proclaimed and crowned—probably according to Sasanian ritual—by his men, Theophobos made no move against Theophilos, and the \"Persian\" troops remained quiescent at Sinope. Instead, he quickly engaged in secret negotiations with the emperor, who in 839 led an army against the rebels. Theophobos agreed to surrender and was restored to his high offices, while his men, numbering some 30,000, were reportedly split up into regiments of 2000 men and divided among the \"themata\". Theophobos was restored to his previous high position in the army, but this was not to last. Islamic sources report that he died in battle in 839 or 840, but the Byzantine sources contain a different, and more likely, account: in 842, Theophilos, already in declining health and about to die, had Theophobos executed by his brother-in-law Petronas in order to secure the succession of his infant son and heir, Michael III (r. 842–867).\n\n"}

The protests took place on 25 April – 2 May 2013 and were organised by the Center for Inquiry (CFI), American Atheists, and the International Humanist and Ethical Union. Demonstrations were held in Dhaka, New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Ottawa and other cities around the world. Secularists sought to express their solidarity with those jailed for speaking their minds about religion. Protesters drew attention to those who were being persecuted for exercising free speech, seeking to convince the international community to exert influence to have the bloggers set free by the Bangladeshi government.\n\nThe events that sparked the rallies began during the shahbag protest when Bangladeshis rallied on the streets to demand capital punishment for Abdul Quader Molla, a war criminal of the Bangladesh liberation war and a leader of Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami. During the protests, Ahmed Rajib Haider, a blogger who was critical of Jamaat-e-Islami, was stabbed to death by Jamaat activists Another controversial author, blogger & online activist named Sunnyur Rahman, popularly known as 'Nastik Nobi' (Atheist Prophet) in the blog community, was also stabbed on 7 March 2013.\n\nMembers of hardline Muslim group, Hifazat-e-Islam, backed by Jamaat, began a violent protest demanding authorities enact harsh anti-blasphemy laws to punish those who insult Islam, calling the bloggers \"anti-Islamic\" and terming all participants of the shahbag movement \"atheists.\"\n\nIn response to these events, the government of Bangladesh set up a panel to monitor blasphemy on social media and blocked a number of blogs and websites. Four bloggers were arrested for posting \"anti-religious\" comments on their blogs. Rasel Pervez, a science teacher, and Mashiur Rahman Biplob were arrested at their homes on 1 April 2013. Subrata Adhikari Shuvo, a masters student at the University of Dhaka was arrested on the same day at his dormitory. Asif Mohiuddin was arrested on 3 April 2013 at his sister's home where he was staying after having been stabbed by Islamist fanatics in January.\n\nThe Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission compelled the Bengali blog \"somewhereinblog.net\" to remove the writings of Asif Mohiuddin. The current blog page reads: \"blog has been withdrawn or cancelled for violating terms and conditions\" (transl.) The move was criticised by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Center for Inquiry, Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and several other bodies. Prominent Bangladeshi blog sites organized the 2013 Bengali blog blackout to protest the government's decision to arrest the bloggers. They were able to garner attention from western media, which eventually led the secularist and humanist bodies to organize the worldwide protests.\n\nParvez and Shuvo were released on bail on 12 May and Biplob on 12 June. Asif secured bail on 27 June after spending three months in jail.\n\nThe protests were organised by Michael De Dora, the director of the CFI's Office of Policy and the organization's representative to the U.N., and coordinated by Avijit Roy, the founder of Mukto-Mona, an independent site for free thinkers and skeptics of Bengali origin. Maryam Namazie, an Iranian-born activist, independently called for 25 April to be an international day to defend Bangladesh's bloggers and activists. Many writers, activists, and prominent intellectuals around the world including Taslima Nasrin, Hemant Mehta, PZ Myers publicly expressed their solidarity and support.\n\n"}
