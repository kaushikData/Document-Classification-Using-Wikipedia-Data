As a result of a lawsuit brought against the school, the school canceled the prom. Parents were encouraged to organize a private prom, but they canceled it. A second private prom was organized and represented to be the official prom. Meanwhile, parents organized a secret prom to which McMillen was not invited and which most of the student body attended. The school district settled the lawsuit by agreeing to a payment to McMillen and adoption of a sexual orientation non-discrimination policy.\n\nIn March 2010, the Itawamba County School District board made international news after it decided to cancel the prom for Itawamba Agricultural High School because 18-year-old lesbian student Constance McMillen had requested permission to take a same-sex date to the event, and to wear a tuxedo. The school board encouraged the creation of a private prom. McMillen called the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which threatened the school with legal action. On March 10, 2010, the ACLU filed a free speech lawsuit on McMillen's behalf, seeking an injunction which would reinstate the prom. The ACLU stated that it was \"shameful and cowardly of the school district to have canceled the prom and to try to blame [the student]\". On April 21, 2010, an amended complaint was filed, seeking compensatory damages. A court hearing was scheduled to take place on Monday, March 22, 2010.\n\nOn a March 12, 2010 appearance on the national CBS Early Show, McMillen said that she had first asked the school principal about bringing a same-sex date to the prom in December 2009, and that he said it was not allowed, due to a concern that pairs of same-sex friends who were not in a relationship would buy less expensive couples tickets instead of individual tickets. McMillen said she told him \"you can't pretend like there's not gay people at our school, and if you tell people they can't bring a same-sex date, that is discrimination to them.\" Although the school board did not explicitly say the prom was cancelled due to McMillen's request, the cancellation came only one week after the ACLU sent a letter to the board pleading her case.\n\nSubsequent to international press coverage of the prom's cancellation, many groups offered to sponsor a non-discriminatory prom and enough money was reportedly raised to host one. However, it was reported that adults posted signs in protest on the high school, including ones stating \"What happened to the Bible Belt?\", and \"Gomorrah\".\n\nOn March 23, 2010, U.S. District Court Judge Glen H. Davidson issued a ruling partly in favor of McMillen and partly favorable to the Itawamba County School District. Judge Davidson ruled that Itawamba County School District did violate McMillen's First Amendment rights by not allowing her to attend the prom with her girlfriend, not allowing her to wear a tuxedo and cancelling the prom. Judge Davidson wrote, \"The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment.\" However, in favor of the Itawamba County School District, Judge Davidson ruled that he would not force the school district to hold the prom since a private prom had already been planned. At the preliminary hearing, school board members testified that all junior and senior students would be allowed to attend the private prom but did not make it clear as to whether or not same-sex couples would be allowed to attend. McMillen received no official information on, or an invitation to, the private prom.\n\nDuring the hearing, the school board testified that they cancelled the prom because the \"media attention generated distracted the school from its educational mission, and that the board cancelled the prom in an attempt to restore order\". Judge Davidson said he was not swayed by that testimony because the high school's own principal had testified to the opposite, saying that \"e-mail and phone calls generated by the controversy had no impact on classroom instruction\".\n\nOn July 20, 2010, the school district settled the case out of court by paying McMillen $35,000, paying her attorneys' fees, and agreeing to create a non-discrimination policy that includes sexual orientation.\n\nOn March 30, 2010, \"The Clarion-Ledger\" newspaper reported that the original private prom scheduled to be held at the Tupelo Furniture Market had been cancelled after McMillen attempted to purchase a ticket. Lori Byrd, who served on the parent organizing committee of the private prom, told the newspaper that there were many parents involved who did not want to be sued for not allowing same-sex dates at the private prom, so they cancelled it. However, the \"Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal\" reported the following day that a new private prom had been organized, to be held at the Fulton Country Club, and that McMillen would be allowed to attend with her girlfriend.\n\nMcMillen and her date attended the prom, but found only five other students in attendance including two students \"with learning difficulties\". A second secret private prom had been arranged by parents, to be held in the community of Evergreen, and the rest of the students chose to attend that prom instead of the Fulton Country Club prom. McMillen said she was aware of the \"Evergreen\" event but when she asked another student if she was invited, the student told her, \"the prom is at the country club.\" McMillen said she took that answer as a \"no\" in regards to her question on whether or not she was invited and details about the secret private prom were kept from her.\n\nStudents who attended the \"Evergreen\" prom posted photos of the event on their Facebook pages, but many of the photos were deleted after they became public. Some students said the event was not a prom but was instead a birthday party, while others said it was just a private party. However, while claiming the event was not a prom publicly, students uploaded photos from the event to their Facebook pages labeled as \"Prom 2010\" and posted status updates which referred to the gathering as \"prom\".\n\nMcMillen subsequently transferred out of the Itawamba high school and into Murrah High School in Jackson, Mississippi, saying she was harassed by other students blaming her for the prom controversy.\n\nThe controversy brought about worldwide media attention as well as attention from celebrities.\n\nDan Savage, a sex and relationship advice columnist and podcaster, exhorted his followers to contact the principal and superintendent of the school to protest the decision.\n\nEllen DeGeneres invited McMillen to be a guest on her television show, \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\". On the show, DeGeneres presented McMillen with a $30,000 scholarship, paid for and donated by Tonic.com.\n\nMcMillen was also invited to be a guest by Wanda Sykes on her television show, \"The Wanda Sykes Show\". On the show, Sykes noted that she was receiving the Stephen F. Kolzack Award at the 2010 GLAAD Media Awards and that award recipients, such as her, could decide whom they wanted to present their award. Sykes said that she would like McMillen to come to Los Angeles, at Sykes's expense, and be the person who presented the award to her.\n\nCelebrity blogger Perez Hilton invited McMillen and guests of her choosing to attend at his expense a birthday bash being held for him, and she accepted. When he posted about it on his web site, he wrote that \"she will be treated like a homecoming queen for the day.\"\n\nAlong with activists Judy Shepard and Lt. Daniel Choi, McMillen was chosen as a Grand Marshal of the 2010 New York City Gay Pride March.\n\nThe television series \"Drop Dead Diva\" based a season 3 episode on the incident (\"Prom\", aired July 24, 2011). Wanda Sykes plays the judge, Amanda Bearse another judge, and McMillen has a cameo role as a bailiff.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "50477914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50477914", "title": "Al-Irfan (magazine)", "text": "Al-Irfan (magazine)\n\nThe Arabic Shiite reform journal al-ʿIrfān (Arabic: العرفان; DMG: al-ʿIrfān; English: \"Knowledge\") was founded in Beirut by Aḥmad ʿĀrif az-Zain (1884-1960) in 1909. From 1910 the publication was transferred to a special printing house in Saida, South Lebanon. Az-Zain, who had worked before for different magazines, among others Ṯamarāt al-funūn (1875-1908), was in charge until 1960. Together with Aḥmad Riḍā (1872-1953) and Sulaimān Ẓāhir (1873-1960) he initiated a new stage of Nahḍa with this encyclopedic educational journal in South Lebanon.\n\nThe subtitle (\"maǧalla ʿilmīya, adabīya, aḫlāqīya, iǧtimāʿīya\") explains clearly that al-ʿIrfān was a journal for science, literature, morals and social issues. Moreover, in the preface of the first edition it was formulated that no political or controverse religious articles should be published. Its stated objectives were to create a suitable educational institution for a broader audience that should guarantee the well-being of the public and serve the progress. As South Lebanon was not included in this process yet, the editor wanted to take this initiative by founding al-ʿIrfān.\n\nFrom 1910/1911 the range of content was extended. Articles on technical progress and new inventions, on Shiite history as well as on women’s topics such as upbringing and emancipation were now included. Numerous illustrations should give the journal a modern look and maybe to address those who could not read. From 1922/1923 on an additional page with jokes and anecdotes was published to address a wider audience. Topics such as rights, freedom and democracy were gradually taken up.\n\nAl-ʿIrfān wanted to be, in contrast to other model-journals like \"al-Muqtataf\" and \"al-Hilal\", a mouthpiece for the religious groups of Arabic Shiites. This was explicitly shown, i. e. in the cover of the 5th year, with the addition šuʿūn aš-šīʿa („concerns of the Shia“). 90% of the subscribers were Shiites from Lebanon, Iraq, Bahrain, Kuwait and other countries. Az-Zain considered himself a reformer, who understands the Islamic world as a cultural and not only as a religious unit.\n\nObjectives and content of the journal changed over time. Instead of spreading progress and enlightenment, other current and political topics became predominant.\n\nAfter the independence of Lebanon in 1943 the thematic focus was more and more on the rights of Shiites in Lebanon. Az-Zain's son Nizar took over the management of the journal after his father’s death in 1960, which now published mainly literature topics. After Nizar's death in 1981 the publication was handed over to his nephew Fuʿād az-Zain.\n"}

The basic aim of AADM is to save life and property in the event of a disaster, be it natural or manmade. Towards this end, AADM imparts disaster management training to every desirous individual, irrespective of nationality, caste, creed, or religion. The main objective of AADM is to build up a volunteer base across the globe, that will be able to handle various disasters and disaster situations effectively. AADM has a trained Disaster Management Volunteer (DMV) force of about 60,000.\n\nAADM was founded in April 2005, under section 25 of The Companies Act, 1956. The academy was formed under the guidance of Dr. Aniruddha D. Joshi (M.D. Medicine, Rheumatologist, who is fondly referred as Aniruddha Bapu).\n\nAADM’s mission is to teach a person to save one's life first, in order to be able to save other people's lives during and in the aftermath of a man made or natural disaster. The trained disaster management volunteers, in turn, will reach out to the masses, across the length and breadth of the country, for imparting training in the basics of disaster management, absolutely free of cost.\n\nThe Textbook of Disaster Management was compiled by AADM in the year 2002. It has proved to be of great help in training the trainer on how to impart effective disaster management training to an average citizen of India. It also serves as a virtual handbook in the event of a disaster.\n\nThere are two types of volunteers:\n\n(i) ‘DMV’ (Disaster Management Volunteer) The members trained in the 7-day basic disaster management course offered by AADM are termed as ‘DMV’s.\n\n(ii)‘Transmitter’ (Trainers for DMVs). Those come forward to teach fellow citizens in basic disaster management are termed as ‘Transmitters’. Currently AADM has a total of 60,000 DMVs and 450 Transmitters.\n\nThe Basic Disaster Management Training Course includes training the common citizen in the finer aspects of first-aid, with the objective of saving lives until Qualified Medical Assistance arrives. Apart from the first-aid techniques, the training course also covers information on all possible kinds of disasters and ways to effectively respond to them. This includes natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, cyclones, famines, drought, etc. and man made disasters such as explosions (bomb blasts), religious violence(communal riots), etc., as also nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, which have come to pose a genuine and serious threat to the very survival of mankind and civilization.\n\n\nAssistance to local civic authorities during 26 July 2005 Heavy rainfall disaster:\n\nOn July 26, 2005, when heavy rains created a disaster like situation in Mumbai and Maharashtra, AADM’s DMVs offered help to the local civic authorities in the rescue operations by making rafts out of used plastic bottles and ferrying the affected to safety.\nOn the same day when a landslide struck Saki Naka, a suburb of Mumbai, the DMVs played a crucial role in saving lives and extricating bodies from the rubble in extremely challenging conditions.\n\nAssistance to local civic authorities during incidents of fire: \nAADM DMVs actively assist Mumbai’s fire brigade and Mumbai police authorities during incidents of fire. For instance, they successfully assisted the authorities when fire broke out at the office of Fairdeal Corporation Ltd., at Jogeshwari, Mumbai, Maharashtra on 26 January 2006\nFire at Hansa Ind. Estate, Mumbai on 6 July 2006\n\nAssistance to local civic authorities during man made disasters:\nWhen serial blasts occurred in the compartments of the suburban trains of Western Railway on 11 July 2006, as also the bomb blast at the Agarwal Hospital, Mulund (W), Mumbai on March 15, 2003, at Bomb Blasts at German Bakery, Pune on February 15, 2010 \n\nCrowd control activities during fairs and festivals at religious places:\nAADM DMVs help in controlling and regulating the crowds queuing up for darshan, or where large crowd movement takes place following are such examples, \nSiddhivinayak Temple, Mumbai,\nMahalakshmi Temple, Mumbai\nMount Mary Church, Bandra, Mumbai, \nMandher Devi Temple in Mandhradevi, Satara, Maharasshtra\nPaithan, Aurangabad, Maharashtra \nImmersion of Lord Ganesh Idols during Ganesh Utsavin different parts of Maharashtra\n\nA disaster management training workshop was conducted for the Nandurbar police force on the invitation of the Superintendent of Police – Nandurbar, Maharashtra.\n\nAADM considers soil fertility and environmental protection as the two key aspects of disaster management (prevention section). AADM achieves these by adopting to vermiculture which is an eco-friendly waste management technology.\n\nIt is the technology of rearing or cultivating earthworms and using them as natural bio reactors in waste management. It is a simple procedure of maintaining and culturing earthworms that feed on the biodegradable waste, defaces and multiply on wastes.\n\nIt can handle all types of bio-degradable waste like food waste, floral and vegetable waste, garden waste, cow dung and paper waste. The non vegetarian food items can also be used. However they take longer time to decompose which could produce poor smell. The dry waste like glass, thermocol, plastic, rubber or likewise which does not decompose cannot be used in the process.\n\nIt also helps to protect the earthworm species which plays an important role in soil fertility and environment protection.\n\nIt can be practiced in cities and villages or farms. In cities, the citizens should show active participation to overcome the alarming state of the environment. It can be carried out near cow sheds, backyards, basements or any suitable place which can be well protected. Unlike cities, villages have a wider scope for adopting Vermiculture with all the necessary resources easily available and in abundance.\n\nSalient features:\n\n• Large quantities of waste can be converted to Vermicompost which would otherwise be burned (garden waste) or piled into dumping grounds or other natural bodies\n\n• The process is practically free from foul odor & generates little heat which can be easily controlled.\n\n• Construction of pits & shade can be made according to the geographic location and climatic conditions of the area. Hence Capital for the project can be tailored to suit the budget bracket.\n\n• Ideally a dedicated manpower of four can handle an entire project.\n\n• Requires 1-1½ hour of field work in the morning & evening in the initial stage. later on when the pits are fully dumped with waste, it requires less time to monitor parameters such as pH & temperature.\n\n• The first output of rich Vermicompost takes 2-2½ months but the second cycle is completed within 45 days. As number of worms increase the quality & quantity of manure increases.\n\nKey process requirements:\n\n• Availability of space - may vary depending on the quantity of waste but 500 sq. ft. is typically sufficient\n\n• Availability of water & electricity nearby\n\nRaw material requirements:\n\n• Easily available bedding material like paddy straw, coconut palms, coconut choirs and sugarcane bagasse.\n\n• Supply of cow dung (either dry decomposed or at least 15 days old) as a primary source of food for earthworms. Wet cow dung if available abundantly can be stored or stacked.\n\nThe individuals can practice this technology at the household level. The salient features are\n\n• It can be done in a small plastic bucket, tray or earthen pots.\n\n• It is economical and the procedure too is very simple.\n\n• One can devote time according to one’s suitability.\n\n• It can be practiced by people of all ages.\n\nThe derived Vermicompost and vermiwash can be used to create small balcony plants, terrace gardens, tree saplings etc.\nKey success factors:\n\n• Bedding - Selection of proper bedding material like paddy straw, sugarcane baggasse or coconut coirs is a key.\n\n• Food source - The bio-degradable waste (kitchen waste, floral waste, agro waste, cow dung and paper)\n\n• Adequate moisture – The bedding used should be able to hold sufficient moisture. The earthworms breathe through their skin and so moisture content is very crucial for their existence.\n\n• Adequate aeration - Worms are oxygen breathers and cannot survive anaerobic conditions. They operate best when ventilation is good and the material they are living is porous and well aerated.\n\n• Protection from extreme temperature - The temperature control is essential for the process and requires near about room temperature of 25 to 28 degrees ideally.\n\nThe other important parameters are pH, salt content and proper shelter.\n\nBenefits\n\n• As the biodegradable garbage is disposed off through the vermiculture process, there is less pollution of natural resources through garbage\n\n• Open lands and play grounds being turned into dumping grounds can be avoided.\n\n• Outbreak of diseases can be minimized.\n\n• Soil fertility deterioration can be reduced by using natural fertilizers instead of chemical fertilizers/ pesticides.\n\n• Destruction of the significant soil Eco-system can be reduced.\n\n• The biggest disaster for the farmers viz. decline in farm productivity can be minimized.\n\n• Pollution through food chain can be minimized which is highly destructive for plants animals and humankind.\n\n• The water holding capacity of Vermicompost is many times more as compared to chemical fertilizers. This increases the water retention capacity of the soil preventing soil erosion.\n\n• The production of plants and crops is of a very god quality in terms of color, size, taste and quality.\n\nAADM formed a core team of 50 volunteers for a full-fledged training in the pilot project. The core team started the project at household level with an initial seed provided by the Academy to get the practical knowledge of the project and develop as a trainer’s team. “Train the trainer” approach was used.\n\nPilot project at VJTI campus (Mumbai):\n\n• The first pilot project was set up at VJTI campus (Mumbai) using their cafeteria and garden waste.\n• The project was implemented and looked after by the Academy’s core team of volunteers.\n\n• A large pit was built using the service of the volunteers.\n\nConsultancy projects:\n\nAADM also offers consultancy to various housing societies, corporate, schools and colleges. Under consultancy, a team of volunteers from the Academy visit the site for survey, and submit a survey report thereafter to cater the requirements for the project execution. The people handling the projects are trained by the Academy’s team by personal visits till the first crop of Vermicompost is harvested Thereafter it is the sole responsibility of the society or institution to continue the project in the long run.\nConsultancy for vermiculture was provided to the various Educational Institutes, Govt. organizations like \n• Naval Dockyard – Colaba \n• Central Railway Matunga workshop\n\n• Pearl Society - Vile Parle \n• NABARD\n\nProject awareness:\n\nUpon request from schools and colleges, introduction and demonstrations have been given to students. \nThe demonstrations have been conducted through power point presentations, display charts and practicals. The students are encouraged to maintain a small scale vermiculture bin which can be rated by the teachers as a part of the school project.\n\nKey awareness projects\n\nAwareness through lecture and demonstrations in 24 wards of MCGM-Education Dept. for school children, parents, staff teachers, gardeners and CDO (Community Development Officers) covering around 200 schools. for such programs were conducted half-yearly during Feb.’05 to Dec.’06.\n\nFuture for vermiculture in India\n\nTill date 87 tons of Vermicompost has been produced from the academy’s own projects in Mumbai and Maharashtra region and has been utilized for tree plantation. That amounts to approx. 340 tons of waste conversion into Vermicompost.\n\n\"Vermiculture is an eco-friendly waste management technology. It is definitely cost effective and can be implemented in urban and rural areas. It is easy to practice and helps us curb air, water and land pollutions. ‘Trees’ are considered as living immovable souls. By supplying them with good fertilizers and water, we are not only nurturing them but also trying to repay the obligation of our Mother Earth in a small and righteous way.\n\nIn 2007, AADM was invited by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to participate in the 'Monsoon Disaster Plan (2007)’ launched by it.\n\nParticipation in Disaster Risk Management Master Plan (DRMMP) Project :\n\nAADM has contributed to this project initiated by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), by gathering and compiling information for the Emergency Operation Plan (EOP), and preparing the process document for Emergency Support Function (ESF) which form part of the DRMMP Project.\n\nParticipation in Tatpar Mumbai Project:\n\nAADM participated in the Tatpar Mumbai Project, organized by MCGM together with Mumbai Police, Fire department, National Disaster Unit and other NGOs.\n\nParticipation in Asia Megacities Forum (AMF) 2009 event:\n\nThis forum was organized between the 22 and 24 April 2009, by MCGM in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), who are also partners of EMI (Earthquakes and Megacities Initiative)\n\n"}

The festival presents about 30 concerts in October every year offering a wide variety of classical and jazz music including opera, orchestral, chamber, solo, and choral concerts. BMF also gives prominence to music education and community engagement offering free children's concerts and students' concerts, as well as master classes which draw about 6,000 music students, teachers, and spectators. It prides itself in presenting both Western and Chinese music alike.\n\nNotable performers that have appeared at the festival include Martha Argerich, Pinchas Zukerman, Jean Yves Thibaudet, Emmanuel Ax, Murray Perahia, Maxim Vengerov, Christoph Eschenbach, Tan Dun, Kathleen Battle, Jose Carreras, Sarah Chang, Augustin Dumay, Valery Gergiev, Mischa Maisky, Krzysztof Penderecki, Issac Stern, Melvyn Tan, Fou Ts'ong, the Kodály Quartet, and the New London Consort.\n\nIn June 2018, the President and Artistic Director of BMF for 20 years, world-renowned Chinese conductor Maestro Long Yu, stepped down passing the Artistic Director role to Shuang Zou. Long Yu is now the chair of the artistic committee.\n\nBeijing Music Festival is a non-profit organization which was founded in 1998 by Long Yu, with the endorsement of the Ministry of Culture of China and the Beijing Municipal Government. The festival has presented numerous historical performances such as the China premiere of Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 8 (2002), the Asian premiere of Alban Berg's opera, \"Lulu\" (2002); Guo Wenjing's operas, \"Ye Yan\" (2003) and \"Wolf Club Village\" (2003); and the China premiere of Ricard Wagner's complete \"Ring Cycle\" (2005). The festival encourages the production of both Western and Chinese contemporary music presenting premieres and commissions by composers such as Krzysztof Penderecki, Philip Glass, Guo Wenjing, Ye Xiaogang, Tan Dun, and Howard Shore.\nBMF was among the first organizations in China to commission new works by Chinese composers as well as foreign composers, which has laid a strong base for international cultural exchange.\n\nHeld from October 8-29, 2017, the theme of BMF's 2017 festival was \"Beijing Music Festival at 20\" to commemorate its 20th anniversary. Highlights of the 41 events and outreach activities included an 11-hour orchestral marathon with nine Chinese symphony orchestras, a joint production with Salzburg Easter Festival of Richard Wagner's opera Die Walküre with Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra under Jaap van Zweden, and the premiere of Qigang Chen's Violin Concerto by violinist Maxim Vengerov at the closing concert. \n\nThe theme of BMF's 19th festival, which was held from October 9–29, 2016 was \"Musical Legacy and Innovation.\" The opening concert by China NCPA Orchestra and Chorus led by Lü Jia was the first collaboration between NCPA and BMF. The festival also presented the Chinese premiere of Benjamin Britten's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" directed by Robert Carsen to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death and launched a five-year planned collaboration between BMF and Festival d'Aix-en-Provence. Other performances included Mozart's \"Don Giovanni\" presented as an immersive theatrical experience with visual effects; \"Blank Out\", a 3D mini opera by Dutch composer Michel van der Aa; and the complete symphonic works of Tchaikovsky. \n\nBMF's 18th festival, held from October 8–24, 2015, included 18 performances by artists from over 30 countries and regions. The theme was \"Revel in Romance\" and focused on monumental works on opposite sides of the Romantic music spectrum - Johannes Brahms and Richard Wagner. Highlights included conductor Jukka-Pekka Saraste leading the WDR Orchestra in the ambitious Brahms 4 Plus 4 Project (four concertos and four symphonies) and Gustav Kuhn leading Tirol Festival Erl in Wagner’s \"Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg\" and \"Tristan und Isolde\".\n\nIn commemoration of its 10th anniversary, BMF commissioned a second version of Krzysztof Penderecki's Symphony No. 8. The new version included an anonymous 15th-century Chinese poem and is 30 minutes longer than the original work. The commissioned version premiered on October 24, 2007 by the China Philharmonic Orchestra under the baton of its composer.\n\nBMF co-commissioned Zhou Long's first opera, \"Madame White Snake\", with Opera Boston, which marked the first collaboration between BMF and an American opera company. Based on the Chinese legend of the White Snake, the work was premiered in Boston by Opera Boston on February 26, 2010 and then in China on October 27, 2010 during the 13th Beijing Music Festival.\n\nThe BMF Arts Foundation commissioned Howard Shore's \"Ruin and Memory\", a concerto for piano and orchestra written for and premiered by Lang Lang with the China Philharmonic conducted by Long Yu on October 11, 2010. The three-movement work was written in celebration of Frederic Chopin's 200th anniversary. Shore commented \"The piece is really my musical reflection of Chopin's time and the life he lived. The title captures a bit of Chopin's life, about where he came from and the world he lived in, and what became of him when that world no longer existed.\" \n\nBMF commissioned the opera, \"Song of Farewell\" by Ye Xiaogang, and gave the world premiere during the closing concerts of the 13th festival, October 30 and 31, 2010. The work fuses Peking Opera and Western Opera with its traditional Chinese staging and Puccini-like score. The work is based on the Chinese film \"Farewell My Concubine\".\n\nBMF partners with the Central Conservatory of Music to hold master classes for music students with such musicians as Isaac Stern, Ken Nagano, Fou Ts'ong, Mo Hualun, Warren Mok, Melvyn Tan, Jian Wang, and the Kodály Quartet. They also hold free children's concerts, pre-performance lectures, and student concerts.\n\nThe artistic committee includes:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "13237371", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13237371", "title": "Cult of the offensive", "text": "Cult of the offensive\n\nThe cult of the offensive refers to a strategic military dilemma, where leaders believe that offensive advantages are so great that a defending force would have no hope of repelling the attack; consequently, all states choose to attack. It is most often used in the context of explaining the causes of World War I and the subsequent heavy losses that occurred year after year, on all sides, during the fighting on the Western Front.\n\nThe term has also been applied to those considering air power doctrine immediately prior to the opening of World War II, where it was believed \"the bomber will always get through\" and the only way to end a bombing campaign was to bomb the enemy into submission. It is also often used to explain Israeli strategy during the 1960s and 1970s, as demonstrated in the Six-Day War in which Israeli forces attacked and routed much larger enemy forces in a lightning attack.\n\nUnder the cult of offensive, military leaders believe that the attacker will be victorious (or at least cause more casualties than they receive) regardless of circumstance and so defense as a concept is almost completely discredited. This results in all strategies focusing on attacking, and the only valid defensive strategy being to counter-attack.\n\nIn international relations, the cult of offensive is related to the security dilemma and offensive realism theories. It stresses that conquest is easy and security difficult to obtain from a defensive posture. Liberal institutionalists argue that it is a commitment problem and that a preemptive war that results from the security dilemma is fairly rare.\n\nThe cult of the offensive was the dominant theory among many military and political leaders before World War I. Those leaders argued in favor of declaring war and launching an offensive, believing they could cripple their opponents, and fearing that if they waited, they in turn would be defeated. The dominance of this line of thought significantly contributed to the escalation of hostilities, and is seen as one of the causes of World War I.\n\nMilitary theorists of the time generally held that seizing the offensive was of crucial importance, hence belligerents were encouraged to strike first in order to gain the advantage. Most planners wanted to begin mobilization as quickly as possible to avoid being caught on the defensive. This was complicated as mobilizations were expensive, and their schedules were so rigid that they could not be canceled without massive disruption of the country and military disorganization. Thus, the window for diplomacy was shortened by this attitude, and once the mobilizations had begun diplomacy had the added difficulty of having to justify cancelling the mobilizations. This phenomenon was also referred to as \"war by timetable\".\n\nThe German Schlieffen Plan is a notable example of the cult of the offensive. Supported by offensively-minded officers such as Alfred von Schlieffen and Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, it was executed in the first month of the war (with some historians maintaining it was nearly victorious, though others claim the Plan never had any chance of success.) A French counter-attack on the outskirts of Paris, the Battle of the Marne and unexpectedly speedy Russian mobilisation and attacks, ended the German offensive and resulted in years of trench warfare. It was not only Germany who followed the cult of the offensive; the French army, among others, was also driven very strongly by this doctrine, where its supporters included Ferdinand Foch, Joseph Joffre and Loyzeaux de Grandmaison. Officers of that period were indoctrinated that \"The French Army, returning unto its traditions, no longer knows any law other than the offensive.\" This is thought to be the military reason behind the French Conscription Law in July 1913, following the passing of a similar bill in Germany six months earlier: the offensive \"guerre à outrance\" swiftly to seize Alsace-Lorraine was felt by military planners to require an additional 200,000 conscripts with respect to the defensive war for which the army was prepared.\n\nWorld War I was dominated by defensive firepower but the onus on the Entente was to conduct an offensive strategy, that caused mass casualties and mutual exhaustion. German armies prepared elaborate defensive positions on the western front with trenches, barbed wire and concrete strong-points backed by artillery, rifles and machine guns which until 1917, were sufficient to inflict mass losses on attacking infantry and restrict the Franco-British armies to minor gains in ground. Tactical development on the Western Front in 1917 began to return mobility to the battlefield and a form of semi-open warfare developed. Much inter-war military thinking was influenced by the cost of offensives fought for strategic reasons, in circumstances of defensive operational and tactical dominance. In World War II, the Western Allies from 1939–1940 avoided an offensive, intending to wait until Franco-British rearmament had matured and the blockade of Germany had undermined its war economy, then in 1941 or 1942, resume the firepower warfare of 1918.\n"}

The film is loosely based on the crimes of California serial killer Richard Ramirez.\nA man knocks on a teenage girl's door, claiming to be in need of directions. When the girl leaves to answer the phone, the man sneaks in and grabs her when she returns. Physically and verbally assaulting the girl, the man drags her into a bedroom by the neck and rapes her. Tracking the killer is obnoxious Channel 5 Action News reporter Roberto Negro, who has been receiving taunting letters from the murderer. The killer and two accomplices (one of them initially reluctant) attack a pregnant housewife, filming themselves pummeling and raping her at gunpoint. When the trio finishes, they shoot the woman and her dog. Roberto reports on the housewife's death, and while the authorities refuse to confirm there is a serial killer on the loose, Roberto is convinced there is.\n\nSpotting a woman having car trouble, the killer and his partners pull up in their van, force her into the vehicle and take her to their hideout. The woman is filmed being abused, raped and stabbed. An envelope containing a knife, a gun and another note is sent to Roberto and the police acquire clues from these items. Another package, this one containing a VHS tape, is dropped off at Roberto's office. The tape is a tribute to the killer, showing two of his fans brutalizing and sexually assaulting a woman. Roberto recognizes one of the copycats as a gas station attendant, whom the police arrests. Elsewhere, two men recognize the serial killer when he walks by them on the street and chase him, being joined by several others. The killer is cornered in an alleyway, and beat and stabbed to death. Roberto finds the man's body and kicks it twice before walking away.\n\nThe crew of the television series \"Frontline\" stormed off in disgust while visiting the set of the film for their documentary \"American Porn\". The incident led to the \"United States v. Extreme Associates\" obscenity trial. Paul Fishbein, president of AVN, referred to \"Forced Entry\" and the rest of the Extreme Associates library as \"horrible, unwatchable, disgusting, aberrant movies\".\n\n\"The Village Voice\" stated the film is \"The most violent porno I've seen. It's both shocking and completely banal\" while Adult FYI wrote \"It's brutal. More than that, it's terribly evil. Convincing. Incredibly well acted and directed\". A score of six out of ten was awarded by Cyberspace Adult Video Reviews, which concluded its review with \"They have every right to make and sell this tape. It is a shame that these very talented people would waste their time on this. Can you imagine the good stuff they could be doing?\" \n\n\"Forced Entry\" was described as \"a disturbing piece of hardcore, made by and for some very disturbed people\" by Recarts Movies Erotica, which said that while the acting was good and it succeeded in creating physical and sexual tension, it suffered from cheesy effects and editing, inconsistent camerawork, and poor production values. Adult Industry News decried \"Forced Entry\" as a borderline snuff film, writing \"promoting violence and/or making (or trying to make) rape look sexy is very disturbing\" and \"movies like this are more than controversial, they are bad for the adult film business\". Academic Eugenie Brinkema has written extensively on the film, its content and its reception in an article called 'Rough Sex'.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26251518", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26251518", "title": "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!", "text": "Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!\n\nFuck for the Heir Puppy Bear! () was political-artistic performance staged by Russian performance group Voina at the Timiryazev State Biological Museum in Moscow in February 2008.\n\nOn February 23, as a prelude to the event, members of Voina showed up at a meeting of the Young Guard of United Russia and displayed a white banner with the slogan \"Fuck for the Heir Puppy Bear\".\n\nOn February 28, almost twenty people assembled in the Moscow Biological Museum. Five couples undressed in the museum hall \"Metabolism and Energy of Organisms\", and engaged in sexual intercourse next to a glass taxidermy display case which contained a stuffed bear. Participants included Vera Kondakova (from Ukraine), Alexandre Karpenko (from Ukraine), as well as other well known Voina members.\n\nThe performance was a protest of the election of Dmitry Medvedev in the 2008 Russian presidential election. It took place in front of a black flag with a slogan reading: \"Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!\". The title \"Puppy Bear\" is a play on words referring to Medvedev, whose last name derives from the Russian word \"medved\", \"bear\".\n\nThe Voina's performance was photographed and videotaped by several spectators invited by the group. It was also described and photographically illustrated online, by Russian lexicographer and blogger Alexei Plutser-Sarno, who himself participated in the action. Photos of the performance were also published by blogger adolfych. Following these blog reports, the action was covered by the media and met with mostly conservative responses in Russian society.\n\nOn March 3, Voina reappeared with the same slogan and marched with the banner \"I fuck the heir Puppy Bear\" at the Dissenters March in St. Petersburg.\n\nThe performance was announced as a ritual for the bear totem. Plucer-Sarno explained the reason for the action was \"We do not have a goal to necessarily be radical instigators. We have a goal to be honest artists and tell what we think. We think that the government fucks the people, and the people like this. This is why the action 'Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear' was born\". He also said in the same interview that \"This is a portrait of pre-election Russia: everybody fucks each other, and the puppy bear looks at that with an unconcealed scorn\".\n\nPlucer-Sarno published in his blog a commentary by artist Maria Perchikhina that described the performance as an \"act of subversive affirmation\". According to this opinion, the stuffed bear symbolizes the Russian political system, termed \"imitation democracy\" by Dmitry Furman, and turns into the figure of the \"chosen chief bear\". The goal of the action then, following the analogy of archaic fertility rituals, is birth assistance for the new political system. The ideas of fertility and reproduction along with the national idea form the core of the new political system. The single transgressive feature in the performance was the publicity of sexual activity. Perchikhina interpreted that transgressive feature as subversive affirmation, in other words, a resistance to the system by outperforming it (similar to \"trying to be a better catholic than the Pope\"). She also quoted an article by Inke Arns and Sylvia Sasse where the principle of subversive affirmation was explained.\n\nPolitical science expert Ilya Prokudin commented that the action was clearly political: \"The action in the Zoological museum had a political character. It was dedicated to the newly baked (we should not call him newly elected, who elected him?) puppy president, Medvedev, and mocked one of the 'national projects' curated by him, namely 'on the increase in birth rate'. For the least apprehensive, even a pregnant woman ('Nadezhda Tolokonnikova') was part of the scene.\n\nOne of the performers in phone interview with internet news agency Lenta.ru said that a student was expelled from the Faculty of Philosophy of MSU for participating in the action. However, the Dean of the Faculty, V.V. Mironov, stated that two or three students had been expelled long before the performance for poor grades. Mironov condemned such performances and claimed that the majority of MSU students share his negative opinion.\n\nAn unnamed organization gathered a collection of signatures under a document that condemned the performance. However, an alternative group collected signatures in favor of the performance.\n\nGenerally negative opinions of \"Fuck for the heir Puppy Bear!\" were published by the media. A number of publications focused on the amoral behavior of the performers. Newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda commented: \"They are not unrecognized geniuses. They are losers and poseurs acting on the principle: 'come, trash the place, go away'. For the PR, they would dance on a grave, and even take off their panties in public. And they do not care that after such actions innocent people suffer - metro employees, museum keepers. These actions of urban psychos stink very badly.\"\n\nMikhail Zhukhov, a lawyer from the attorney's collegium \"Justice\" commented that the performers' actions contained elements of crime described in Article 213, \"Hooliganism\", of Russian Criminal Code: \"The action of the participants severely violated social order. Taking into account the place and the fact that people with photo-cameras and video-cameras were invited, a conclusion can be made about the existence or premeditation. All of this was done by a group of people by a prior arrangement. The participants might face harsh consequences - part 2 of article 213 of Russian Criminal Code makes a provision for a prison sentence for up to seven years. Museum staff should write a report to the Internal Affairs Department\".\n\nA representative of the foundation for effective politics, Pavel Danilin, called the performers pornographers and jerks and claimed that they had put shame on the Faculty and the University.\n\nRussian poet Dmitry Volchek, who participated along with Alexei Plucer-Sarno in the Radio Liberty program devoted to the performance, claimed that the action had not been radical enough. He had also commented that the essence of conceptual art is in targeting the most vulnerable spot in the subconsciousness. In Volchek's opinion, that spot was accidentally hit by the action, making the stroke so painful.\n\nTelevision covered the performance in several programs that described Voina's activities.\n\nVideos of the action and of its media coverage can be found on the Internet.\n\n"}
{"id": "40831146", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40831146", "title": "Fun Home (musical)", "text": "Fun Home (musical)\n\nFun Home is a musical adapted by Lisa Kron and Jeanine Tesori from Alison Bechdel's 2006 graphic memoir of the same name. The story concerns Bechdel's discovery of her own sexuality, her relationship with her gay father, and her attempts to unlock the mysteries surrounding his life. It is the first Broadway musical with a lesbian protagonist. It is told in a series of non-linear vignettes connected by narration provided by the adult Alison character.\n\nThe musical was developed through several readings and performances, including at the Ojai Playwrights Conference in 2009 and at the Sundance Theatre Lab and The Public Theater's Public Lab in 2012. It opened Off-Broadway at the Public Theater in September 2013 to positive reviews. Its run was extended several times, until January 2014. The Public Theater production of \"Fun Home\" was nominated for nine Lucille Lortel Awards (winning three, including Outstanding Musical), two Obie Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards, among others.\n\nThe original Broadway production began previews at the Circle in the Square Theatre in March 2015 and opened in April 2015. It was nominated for twelve Tony Awards, winning five, including Best Musical, and its cast album received a nomination for the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. The production closed on September 10, 2016. A US national tour and foreign productions followed.\n\nWriter/artist Alison Bechdel's book \"Fun Home\", a memoir in comics format, was published in 2006 to critical acclaim. Its subject is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce. Bechdel's coming out as a lesbian is complicated by the revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage males. Four months after Bechdel comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an oncoming truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Bechdel concludes that he committed suicide.\n\nBechdel's book was adapted into a musical with book and lyrics by Lisa Kron and music by Jeanine Tesori. Writing in \"Slate\", June Thomas called it \"the first mainstream musical about a young lesbian\". The adaptation was developed over the course of five years. It was first workshopped at the Ojai Playwrights Conference in August 2009. A staged reading was performed at The Public Theater in 2011. (Of the cast of that staged reading, only Judy Kuhn and Beth Malone continued in their roles to the full Off-Broadway production.) The musical had another workshop as part of the Sundance Institute's Theater Lab in July 2012, featuring Raul Esparza. Following that it ran for three weeks as part of the Public Theater's Public Lab series in October and November 2012. On April 8, 2013, musical selections from the show were performed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, Judy Kuhn, David Hyde Pierce and others at an event for the Sundance Institute. A final Public Theater workshop was held in May 2013.\n\nThe musical's development process entailed extensive changes and rewrites. Beth Malone said that the original workshop script \"doesn't resemble this current play at all\". In early versions, the production was structured around Bechdel's drawings, but the creators later removed most of this element, save for one image of Bruce and young Alison which is used at the musical's conclusion. Revisions continued through the preview period of the Off-Broadway production, requiring the actors to perform new material every night.\n\nAs she works on her memoir in the present day, successful middle-aged cartoonist Alison Bechdel (Alison) recalls two time periods in her life. The first is her childhood, around age 10 (Small Alison), when she struggles against her father Bruce's obsessive demands and begins to identify her inchoate sexuality. The second is her first year in college (Medium Alison), when she begins her first relationship and comes out of the closet as a lesbian. \n\nAlison remembers herself, as a child, demanding that her father Bruce play \"airplane\" with her, while he sorts through a box of junk and valuables he has salvaged from a barn (\"It All Comes Back\"). Bruce tells the family that a visitor from the local historical society is coming to see their ornate Victorian home that he has restored, and his wife Helen prepares the house to Bruce's demanding aesthetic standard (\"Welcome to Our House on Maple Avenue\"). In a phone call with her father and a journal entry, Medium Alison expresses her anxiety about starting college (\"Not Too Bad\"). At the Bechdel Funeral Home, Small Alison and her brothers John and Christian perform an imaginary advertisement for the funeral home (\"Come to the Fun Home\"). Medium Alison hesitates outside the door of the college's Gay Union, and is flummoxed when she meets Joan, a confident young lesbian. Bruce invites into the house Roy, a young man whom he has hired to do yard work. Bruce begins to seduce Roy in the library while Helen is playing the piano upstairs, trying her best to ignore it (\"Helen's Etude\").\n\nMedium Alison writes a letter to her parents about college life but does not mention Joan or her recent realization that she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison to put on a dress, but she would rather wear jeans. Bruce tells her that the other children would laugh at her; she reluctantly obeys him (\"Party Dress\"). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written a letter to her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself until Joan kisses her. That night, she is delirious with joy after having had sex with Joan and finally discovering her sexuality (\"Changing My Major\").\n\nAlison considers the connection between her coming out and her father's death. Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has lived, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way he thinks it should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled widely, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all be placed in a small circle in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania (\"Maps\"). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches \"The Partridge Family\", but Bruce angrily switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out that he is going to see a psychiatrist, but he is ambiguous about the reason. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen attempts to reassure Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, but she too refuses to elaborate. Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television (\"Raincoat of Love\").\n\nAlison remembers a time when Bruce took her and her brothers on a trip to New York City. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings her a lullaby (\"Pony Girl\"). He reassures his daughter that he's just going out for a paper, but Alison realizes he was probably going cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her (\"Ring of Keys\").\n\nMedium Alison calls home to demand a better response from her parents and is astonished when her mother reveals that her father has had sexual relationships with men and boys. Alison explores the tensions her family was under at this time and watches a heated argument between her parents. Medium Alison returns home for vacation with Joan. Helen confesses to Medium Alison her troubled and turbulent life with Bruce (\"Days and Days\"). Medium Alison, Joan and Bruce have an unexpectedly pleasant evening around the piano. Bruce asks Alison if she'd like to go for a drive, and (adult) Alison realizes that Medium Alison is gone; she joins her father in the car, breaking the boundaries of time. On the drive, she and Bruce struggle to express themselves to each other (\"Telephone Wire\").\n\nBruce, manically engaged in a new restoration project, tries and fails to find a way to hold his life together. He steps in front of a truck and is killed (\"Edges of the World\"). Alison, newly reconciled to her past, remembers and draws a moment of perfect balance: playing \"airplane\" with her father, while reminiscing about the past with the other Alisons (\"Flying Away\").\n\n\"Fun Home\" premiered Off-Broadway at The Public Theater in previews on September 30, 2013, and opened officially on October 22, 2013. Originally scheduled to run through November 3, 2013, the run was extended several times, and the musical closed on January 12, 2014. The production was directed by Sam Gold, with sets and costumes by David Zinn, lighting by Ben Stanton, projections by Jim Findlay and Jeff Sugg, and choreography by Danny Mefford. In response to a controversy in which the legislature of South Carolina attempted to financially punish the College of Charleston for choosing the original graphic novel of \"Fun Home\" as a reading selection for incoming freshmen, the off-Broadway cast presented a concert of songs from the musical to a full house in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 2014. Bechdel, Kron, Tesori and musical director Chris Fenwick accompanied the cast.\n\nThe musical began previews at Broadway's Circle in the Square Theatre on March 27, 2015, with an official opening on April 19, 2015. Gold directed the show on Broadway, with the same production team as the Off-Broadway production, including Zinn, Mefford and Stanton. The Off-Broadway cast reprised their roles on Broadway, except for the actors playing Medium Alison, John and Christian Bechdel. In December 2015, eight months after opening on Broadway, the show recouped its capitalization and began to make a profit. Costs for the show were relatively low due to a small cast and orchestra. The production closed on September 10, 2016, after 26 previews and 582 regular performances.\n\nA year-long U.S. national tour of the show began in Cleveland, Ohio, in October 2016. The tour was directed by Sam Gold and starred Kate Shindle as Alison and Robert Petkoff as Bruce. The first international production of \"Fun Home\" premiered in Manila, Philippines, in November 2016, with Cris Villonco as Alison, Lea Salonga as Helen and Eric Kunze as Bruce. The production was directed by Bobby Garcia. The limited run of 18 performances closed on November 27, 2016. A review in ABS-CBN News praised the performances and direction and called the production \"undeniably moving, piercing through our core, and performed by an incredibly talented ensemble.\" The first U.S. regional production was in Burlington, Vermont, where Bechdel wrote the graphic memoir, by Vermont Stage Company; it ran for 29 performances in October 2017. Singapore's Pangdemonium theatre company staged \"Fun Home\" in September and October 2017 at the Drama Centre Theatre, with a cast that included Adrian Pang and Monique Wilson.\n\nA Canadian production played in February and March 2018 at the Arts Club in Vancouver. In June 2018, the musical made its London premiere at the Off West End Young Vic theatre with Gold again directing. It stars Kaisa Hammarlund as Alison, Zubin Varla as Bruce and Jenna Russell as Helen and is scheduled to run until September 2018.\n\nThe character of Alison Bechdel is portrayed by three actors. 43-year-old \"Alison\" is the play's narrator who reviews her family and early life, 19-year-old \"Medium Alison\" who is an Oberlin student discovering her sexuality, and 10-year-old \"Small Alison\" who is a child struggling against her father's expectations.\n\nThe original casts are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nSince the songs in \"Fun Home\" are closely integrated into the script, no list of songs was provided in the program.\n\nThe original cast album, released in 2014, opened at #2 on the \"Billboard\" Top Cast Album Chart, a remarkable feat for an Off-Broadway cast album. After the musical opened on Broadway in 2015, new portions of the show were recorded, and parts were re-recorded, especially to feature Emily Skeggs in the role of Medium Alison. It also includes more dialogue to help the listener follow the story. The song \"Party Dress\" was added for Small Alison in place of \"Al for Short\", as the latter has been removed from the Broadway show. A dialogue scene, \"Clueless in New York\", replaced \"I need more coffee\". Bruce's short \"a capella\" bedtime song, \"Pony Girl\" was added, as was the scene \"A flair for the dramatic...\". The album was released in May 2015.\n\nThe track list of the 2015 release, which reflects the musical numbers in the Broadway production, is as follows:\n\nThe Off-Broadway production opened on October 22, 2013, to positive reviews. Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" spoke of the musical's emotional impact, artistry and universality, calling it a \"beautiful heartbreaker of a musical\". \"\"Fun Home\" isn’t just a coming out story or a coming-of-age story. Its universality comes from its awareness of how we never fully know even those closest to us, and of the undercurrent of grown-up secrets, intuited by children, that exists to some degree in every family. \"Fun Home\" finds a shining clarity that lights up the night.\" Brantley praised both writer Kron and composer Tesori for their work. Of Kron he says: \"her book and resonantly precise lyrics give this show its essential spine\", and of Tesori's score \"her best and most varied score to date... [which] captures [the story's] haunting ambiguity.\" Brantley later listed \"Fun Home\" as one of his top 15 shows of 2013.\n\nJoe Dziemianowicz of the New York \"Daily News\" called the musical \"achingly beautiful\" and said that it \"speaks to one family and all families torn by secrets and lies\". Dziemianowicz listed \"Fun Home\" at the top of his Top 10 in Theater for 2013 list. Charles McNulty of the \"Los Angeles Times,\" though mildly critical of a few of the show's elements still was impressed with \"Fun Home\", saying \"There have been plenty of new American musicals better put together than \"Fun Home\", but I can't think of one in recent years that has touched me as much with its tender, ironic and courageous vulnerability.\" He states that the show's seeming weaknesses are part of the reason it succeeds, saying that it \"gets off to a choppy start, takes unnecessary musical detours and is staged in a rough-hewn style that sometimes seems more accidental than intentional\" but that it \"succeeds not despite these flaws but in large measure because of them. Bechdel's ironically self-aware and inwardly searching sensibility is honored by a musical that isn't afraid to reveal its awkward side.\" Though less positive than Brantley, Dziemianowicz or McNulty, Miriam Krule of \"Slate\" still said \"there are also moments of pure joy, and the musical shines during these\". Krule felt, however, that \"it's not clear that a musical is the best second format for the material\". Adam Hetrick, editor-in-chief of Playbill.com, described \"Fun Home\" as \"the best musical of the year\", calling it \"an emotionally-packed piece of theatre, full of joy, heart, sorrow and uncomfortable reality\". \n\n\"New York Times\" music critic Anthony Tommasini praised Tesori's score as a \"masterpiece\", noting that the \"vibrant pastiche songs\" and \"varied kinds of music... a jazzy number for the young Alison in the middle of a rescue fantasy; Sondheim-influenced songs that unfold over insistent rhythmic figures and shifting, rich harmonies\" come together to create \"an impressively integrated entity\". Tommasini also praised the show's ensemble numbers, calling them \"complex yet texturally transparent, engrossingly dramatic\". Reviewing the cast album for \"Playbill\", Steven Suskin praised Kron's \"marvelous set\" of lyrics, called Tesori \"a master of musical styles... [who] matches Kron's tone with a mix of sensitivity and humor.\" Suskin singled out \"Days and Days\" for especial praise, calling it \"a staggering piece of musical theatre writing\". He also lauded the performances of Judy Kuhn (\"stunning\"), Michael Cerveris (\"one of his finest performances ever\") and the three Alisons, Beth Malone, Alexandra Socha and Sydney Lucas (calling the last \"one of the most assured child actors we've seen\"). Suskin called \"Fun Home\" \"the best musical on the New York stage of 2013 — far outclassing the competition — and ... thus far the best musical of the 2013-14 season.\"\n\nAnticipating the play's move to Broadway, David Levesley of online magazine \"Mic\" heralded \"Fun Home\"s focus on the individual experience of a lesbian, calling it \"the most daring, relentless analysis of homosexual identity on the New York stage right now\". Kalle Oskari Mattila, in \"The Atlantic\", however, argued that although the musical presents the novel's themes clearly, its Broadway marketing campaign \"obfuscates rather than clarifies\" the queer narrative of the original novel.\n\nThe Public Theater production of \"Fun Home\" was nominated for the 2014 Edward M. Kennedy Prize for Drama Inspired by American History, nine Lucille Lortel Awards (winning three, including Outstanding Musical), seven Outer Critics Circle Awards (winning Outstanding New Off-Broadway Musical), three Drama League Awards and eight Drama Desk Awards, and it won the Off Broadway Alliance Award for Best New Musical. Many critics predicted that \"Fun Home\" would win the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. The musical was a finalist for the Pulitzer, but \"The Flick\" by Annie Baker won the award. The Pulitzer committee called the musical \"A poignant musical adaptation of a graphic memoir\". The production won the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Musical and the Obie Award for Musical Theater, and 10-year-old Sydney Lucas won an Obie in the Performance category, becoming the youngest performer ever to win an Obie.\n\nThe original Broadway production was nominated for 12 Tony Awards, winning five, including Best Musical. Jeanine Tesori & Lisa Kron were the first female writing team to win the Tony Award for Best Original Score. Kron won for Best Book, Cerveris won for Best Leading Actor, and Gold won for Best Direction. Both Lucas and Skeggs won Theatre World Awards.\n\n\n"}

The work combines written and spoken text, slide projection and film, sound, sculpture, and the use of an assistant. She originally performed it at Franklin Furnace in New York City and performed other iterations through 1983, including at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. Her second performance for the New York nonprofit space was reviewed by Lucy Lippard for the \"Village Voice\", and included in Lippard's 1984 book, \"Get the Message: A Decade of Art for Social Change.\"\n\nThe piece begins with images of a tormented woman, projected with a recording of voices asking \"Hey, why are you so tormented?\" With Nishio on stage, wearing a house covering her face and head, a dialectic is created between emotions and thinking, then a recording of Nishio's voice outlines an effort to stay in control while participating in daily life:\n\n[W]hile the telephone rings and the dog shuffles by someone knocks at the door. Why don't you just sit down and think, think, think, think.\n\nA diagram of the artist's head is flashed with the word \"think\" repeated and pointing to various parts of the brain. There is a film of Nishio inside the house that she wears. She performs a monologue about the thinking process after which she takes off the house and throws across the stage. A meditation tape is played, and the artist lies down performing the soothing exercises instructed. The final instruction is \n\n[I]nside the brain, imagine a huge switchboard. Walk over to it and pull out all the plugs but one. Your only thought is your whole body, feeling quiet, comfortable, relaxed.\n\nThe piece also makes use of Nishio's shadow, and her assistant comes in throughout the performance to put up then take down cutouts of women. In the earlier Franklin Furnace performance, the house covered Nishio's midsection.\n\nOf the 1983 performance at the Woman's Building, Terry Wolverton described it as: \n\na fast-paced multi-media tour of the activities of the brain, and of the person who tries to live inside the brain, disassociated from flesh, spirit, emotion ... Nishio plugs her audience into the rhythms of the over-taxed, over-stimulated nervous system.\n\nWolverton complains about the size of the L.A. performance space lauding the work itself writing, \"there's scarcely a superfluous movement, image, or word.\" She further writes of Nishio's performance, \"It is rare to witness a performer undergo an internal process while performing, and this willingness to be vulnerable gives the work a great sense of depth and strength.\"\n\nLippard in her book called the work \"bitterly beautiful,\" its meanings \"layered,\" its images \"striking.\" The critic interpreted the performance's themes as racism, real estate, and dislocation, and the use of \"'interior decoration' as a metaphor for cultural differences.\"\n"}

With the exception of the years of the two World Wars, it has taken place annually ever since. It was based on the eisteddfod tradition of Wales.\n\nAfter its inception the festival expanded rapidly to encompass other disciplines and crafts, with dance, art, needlework, photography being early additions, which still thrive. Sections have been discarded when no longer applicable (including laundry and shorthand) but others are adopted and integrated, including youth creative arts, crafts and flower arranging. The advent of television in the 1960s had a depressing effect on entries, but this trend was reversed by the middle of the 1980s. From that time there has been a steady increase in interest.\n\nThere are currently two festivals held annually:\n\nEach attracts nearly 3,000 entries, and, via teachers, relations and supporters, it is estimated that the Jersey Eisteddfod reaches a minimum of 10 percent of the population at any one time. With its continuing growth, it has been necessary to move to larger premises for the Spring Festival, and to operate simultaneously at two venues in the Autumn. There are currently 14 autonomous sections: Arts and crafts as adult, primary school, secondary school and youth creative arts; photography, flower arranging, video, handwriting and needlework; dance, music, English speech and drama, Jèrriais and French. Each section sets its own syllabus, engages one or more adjudicators and supervises the entries and the management of the competitions; and is responsible for communications with the competitors.

{"id": "1681795", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1681795", "title": "Local news", "text": "Local news\n\nIn journalism, local news refers to coverage of events, by the news, in a local context that would not be an interest of another locality, or otherwise be of national or international scope. Local news, in contrast to national or international news, caters to the news of their regional and local communities; they focus on more localized issues and events. Some key features of local newsrooms includes regional politics, business, and human interest stories. Local news readership has been declining in recent years, according to a recent study.\n\nOpt-outs of local television news are frequent before, during, or after national evening news television programming. Often times, television networks can also commission or make provisions for their local stations to produce a longer standalone local news programmes. In some cases, local television markets/viewing areas within a country may even have a dedicated 24-hour local news channel. Local news stations have also started covering less and less local politics in favor of stories that they believe will garner more clicks or attention. A study has also shown that there has also been less investigative journalism within local news stations in recent years.\n\nLocal news largely covers the following:\n\nNational and international news, however, tend to cover a wider range of content, including news concerning specialized institutions of wide-ranging international power or influence, such as:\n\nIn the United States, local news is provided on local commercial broadcasting channels (some of which are television network affiliates). They can either be standalone newscasts that run for at least a half-hour or short segments that air attached to national morning newscasts approximately 25 and 55 minutes past the hour. As not all stations are owned and operated by a television network, the graphics, branding, and studio designs of a station's newscasts often differ from the network they are affiliated with although in recent years, affiliates have made some form of on-air reference to their corresponding networks in the branding of their newscasts. In addition, the local news departments of stations also superimpose their on-screen digital clocks, thermometers, and (occasionally) local news tickers on graphics provided by networks during morning network newscasts. Some cable channels are dedicated to local news coverage. Examples of this include NY1 in New York and NewsChannel 8 in the Washington DC market.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, most local news is provided on a local network station with similar branding and studio design to that of the national network news. Examples of this include the nationally networked BBC News and its regional news services such as BBC North West Tonight (on BBC North West) and BBC Newsline (on BBC Northern Ireland); the nationally networked ITV News and its regional stations including ITV Granada and UTV. The long version of BBC and ITV's local news shows often air during the 18:00 hour on weekday evenings. STV, which simulcasts most of the ITV network's programmes in Scotland, is not owned and operated by ITV but has its own branded newscast that broadcasts Scottish-centred news at the same time as ITV's regional news services.\n\nIn France, most local news is aired on France Televisions' France 3. Additionally BFM TV also has a local news channel for the Ile-de-France region called BFM Paris.\n\nNorway's public broadcaster, NRK1, airs a local news programme called NRK Distriktsnyheter (name of viewing area) every weekday evening at 18:45 Central European Time, just before the main national newscast Dagsrevyen. A replay of all local newscasts across the country is shown on NRK2 the following morning (Tuesday to Saturday).\n\nIn Sweden, SVT's regional news is simply called SVT Nyheter (name of viewing area) which shares the same branding as the network's main newscast, Rapport. Unlike SVT's counterparts in the US and UK, during morning programmes, the local news opt-out airs in the middle of each half-hour. Since June 2007, the morning regional cut-ins no longer feature an in-studio presenters but instead show compiled short reports from various correspondents across the region. When SVT World was still airing, the simulcast of the morning programme featured a different regional opt-out during each half-hour. A 13-minute standalone local newscast airs at 18:30 Central European Time each weekday evening after Sportnytt (SVT's sport news) on SVT1. Additionally, a short local news segment is incorporated into SVT's other evening newscast Aktuellt which airs on SVT2. In that case, this local news segment shares the same branding and graphics as Aktuellt. There are no local SVT newscasts on Saturdays.\n\nA lot of newspapers specialise in covering the cities they are based in. Although paper copies of local newspapers are usually sold and circulated exclusively in the local areas they operate (with entities such as libraries or relatives wanting a copy of the paper where a family member is mentioned being mailed copies of outside of circulation areas), companies may make digital copies of their newspapers available to interested readers directly on their website or through services such as PressReader often with a paid subscription.\n\nIn the United States, although newspapers such as \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" have a 'national' focus on their front pages, they still have dedicated sections for news in the areas they are based in. Weather sections also highlight conditions in the local area and the sport sections feature local teams alongside national sport stories. Their local editions also feature local classified ads.\n\nIn the age of digital media, local news readership has started to fall. This can be attributed to the younger generation's disinterest in traditional news sources and the inability of news stations to fully integrate their business models and practices into the age of digital journalism. While national and international news industries began using Twitter as a way to break news and interact with their audiences, local news mediums have fallen behind, trending towards using Twitter as a secondary source for spreading information rather than a primary tool for audience engagement.\n\nSince Internet sites reach a larger audience, more local news agencies have started their own websites to compete in the digital age. Websites are a great way for local news stations to produce more interactive content, which engages the audiences and increases readership.\n\nAside from the Internet, Twitter specifically has become a great way to engage the younger generation in news, gain more readership, and spread information. National news sources have started using Twitter to quickly notify the public of breaking news and to interact with their readers, but local news have failed to integrate Twitter and other forms of social media into their journalism practices as successfully. While local TV news stations have actually been a bit more effective with using social media, local newspapers have overall fallen behind. By engaging the audience and spreading important information, social media has been considered a solid method for strengthening the core standards of journalism. As a result, social media like Twitter has become a vital tool for news agencies to incorporate into their everyday practices.\n\nAs a result of the transition to digital content, local news agencies have had to change their business models. Although they previously gained revenue from subscriptions, more agencies have started making money from online advertising, but this only accounts for a small portion of revenue. This loss in revenue has been linked to a decline in local journalistic integrity, because with less profit, the need to make money through clickbait articles has become a necessity.\n\n"}

In 2018, the Shamrock Club will be producing its 52nd Annual parade.\n\nThe parade is part of a week-long series of events co-sponsored by the Shamrock Club and its partner, Westown Association. These include Irish events at the Shops of Grand Avenue in downtown Milwaukee, Westown's SHAM-Rock the Avenue at the Miller Time Pub in the Hilton Milwaukee City Center on Friday evening, the Shamrock Club's annual Mass in Honor of Saint Patrick at Saint Patrick's Church in Milwaukee, and the Shamrock Club's Post Parade Party at the Irish Cultural and Heritage Center on Saturday, the largest parade day family event, with four stages, four dance schools, seven bands, and a Children's Area.\n\nThe parade runs from 6th and Wisconsin, with official step off at 3rd and Wisconsin, running to Plankinton Avenue, to Old World Third Street, east on Juneau to Water, and ending on Highland. The route is approximately one and one half miles, and takes about 90 minutes.\n\nThe first parade, on March 17, 1843, was organized partly by Milwaukee officials and members of the Catholic Church in Milwaukee. The Milwaukee officials were trying to garner more influence for the area, as it was smaller than Green Bay. Catholic leaders in Milwaukee were trying to have the American Catholic Church, based in Baltimore, place the Archdiocese in Milwaukee. At the time, the United States Church was becoming dominated by Irish cardinals. The Milwaukee Irish and German religious, (there were many Irish born and Gaelic speaking priests in the Wisconsin territory), worked on the bias towards the Irish by the American bishops.\n\nA Swiss German priest, Father Martin Kundig, pushed the idea of the parade. According to Father Leo Johnson, in his 1942 book, \"Stuffed Saddlebags - The Life Of Father Martin Kundig, Priest - 1805-1879\", \"His was a life filled with character.\"\nThe original parade started at what is today East Wells Street and Van Buren, went north on Van Buren, west on what is today State Street, then south on Jackson Street and back to Wells Street. They circled the church of St. Peter, on Jackson and State, the main downtown church at that time. The Parade Marshal was Milwaukee founder <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Solomon Juneau\n\nBy 1844, Milwaukee became the Archdiocese of Wisconsin, beating out the French strongholds of Green Bay, Wisconsin and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin in the western part of the State. The newly consecrated Bishop, John Henni, purchased land near the original parade staging area for the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist (Milwaukee).\n\nIn 1967, the parade marshaled at the top of the Lincoln Memorial Bridge, at the Milwaukee Art Museum, and marched west along Wisconsin Avenue. The parade terminated at the Milwaukee Public Library, on 10th and Wisconsin. This lasted for one year, as it was discovered, as said Danny O'Donoghue, \"The wind blows from west to east, and we had a hard time with the banners and the flags. We decided to reroute the parade.\" In 1968, the parade route was reversed. The parade was marshaled at the Milwaukee Public Library, then headed east along Wisconsin Avenue, and terminated at the Milwaukee County War Memorial, on Lincoln Memorial Drive and Mason Street. A review stand was positioned at Water and Wisconsin, on the Marine National Bank Plaza front court.\n\nParade organizers were invited to move to Mitchell Street on the South Side of Milwaukee. The street was named for Milwaukee pioneer and Scots immigrant Alexander Mitchell It was a business district, filled with department stores and smaller stores. The Mitchell Street Business Association hoped that the appearance of the parade along Milwaukee second oldest business strip would give it a spark at renewal. The parade was marshaled on First Street and Orchard, near the Allen-Bradley, (now <nowiki>\"</nowiki>Rockwell International) headquarters. It marched down First to Mitchell Street, and up Mitchell to 13th Street. The parade attracted large crowds in what was then a Polish and Mexican neighborhood.\n\nIn 1977, Danny O'Donoghue stepped down as Parade Chair. The parade was then headed up by Jeanne McCue. She was the Shamrock Club's first Wild Irish Rose in 1973. McCue was later honored for her work during the Bosnian War, where she utilized her training as a nurse.\n\nIn 1978, Ms. McCue was succeeded by Catherine \"Cate\" Harris, a longtime Shamrock Club member. She would later help lead volunteers at the International Institute of Wisconsin's Holiday Folk Fair. There was still a strong Irish presence in the area, due to the families who settled at Saint Patrick Parish, located at 723 West Washington, a few blocks north of the staging area for the parade. St. Patrick is the site of the yearly Mass in Honor of St. Patrick on Parade day.\n\nCate Harris was succeeded by Chuck Ward, one of the leading forces in the Nash's Irish Castle Kazoo Band. He was also a member of the Milwaukee-based Irish music band Blarney. He was later one of the main coordinators of the Milwaukee Irish Fest.\n\nIn 1985, parade moved to North Avenue, where it ran from 53 Street in Milwaukee, to 74 Street in Wauwatosa. The parade marshaled on the Steuben Middle School playground on 52 and North. The mayors of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa were a part of the parade each year. Maricolette Walsh, the Wauwatosa mayor, was also a Shamrock Club member. She helped to keep fees lower on the Wauwatosa side of 60th Street.\n\nWhile on North Avenue, the Parade committee sponsored a window decorating contest for business along the parade route. The parade route businesses had leprechauns, floral displays, window paint, and shamrocks looking out at the crowds. At the terminus of the parade route, a post parade party was held at Pius XI Grade School, on 76 and Wright. When the parish decided to use their rink only for roller skating the party was moved to the Wauwatosa Civic Center on 76 and North. Both of the Milwaukee area Irish dance schools, Trinity Academy of Irish Dance and Cashel Dennehy Irish Dancers, performed alternating years.\n\nA number of business owners on North Avenue complained of lost revenue for the parade day, as it was a Saturday, streets were closed from 9 AM until 2 pm, and many of the parade goers would just leave after the event, and not spend any money. An alternative was sought.\n\nThe parade was on Bluemound Road in 2001. It still crossed both the cities of Milwaukee and Wauwatosa. Pub owner and County Cork native Derry Hegarty, a former Shamrock Club president, helped facilitate the move. He was the owner of Derry Hegarty's Irish Pub on 54 and Bluemound, one of the many Irish pubs along Bluemound who were excited to host the event in this section of Milwaukee.\n\nThe parade started at 70 Street and ended at 51 Street. It was marshaled between 75 and 74 Streets. Financial problems arose with the co-sponsor, the Bluemound Business Advancement Association, so the Shamrock Club looked for another venue. According to the account in the February 2002 \"Emerald Reflections\", a four-year contract was rejected by the Bluemound Business Advancement Association, and they wanted to put in place a 3-year, $7000 annual contribution instead of the previously agreed-to $10,000 per year.\n\nThe Westown Business Development organization in downtown Milwaukee had been holding a parade on March 17 each year. The attendance was sparse, and the organization was looking for ways to increase attendance. They made a proposal initially in 2000, and after negotiations broke down with the Shamrock Club and the Bluemound Business group, another proposal was put in place. The two organizations agreed to move the 2002 parade downtown.\n\nThe parade took place in downtown Milwaukee in 2002. The original parade route was from 6th and Wisconsin, east to Water Street, north on Water Street, and west on Juneau Avenue to Old World Third Street to Wells and Plankinton. In 2004, the route was changed to go north on Plankinton Avenue to Old World Third Street, then to Juneau, east to Water Street, and terminating at Highland Boulevard. The change was done at the request of the Marcus Center for the Performing Arts, as the parade was blocking access to the center for Saturday matinees. The parade steps off at the Shops of Grand Avenue on 3rd and Wisconsin.\n\nMike Boyle returned in 2009, assisted by daughters Erin Boyle and Meghan Boyle. In 2012 and 2013, the parade was directed by Mike Boyle and Denis Donohoe. Killian's Irish Red, a MillerCoors brand, was the lead sponsor starting in 2013, and continuing in 2016. In 2014, Josh Walton took over the parade. The parade was again led by Michael Boyle in 2015, and continues under his leadership.\n\n The 2018 Parade will be the 52nd Annual Parade. It will be held on Saturday, March 10, 2018. It steps off at 3rd and Wisconsin at noon. The parade will run from 3rd and Wisconsin to Plankinton, north to Old World Third Street, then to Juneau Avenue, and down to Water Street, and from there to Highland Avenue, just north of the Marcus Center for the Arts. \n\nAs it is both the 175th anniversary of the first St. Patrick Parade in Milwaukee, and the founding of the Milwaukee Archdiocese, Archbishop Jerome Listecki will be both the Grand Marshal and the celebrant at the 33rd Annual Mass in Honor of St. Patrick at St. Patrick's Church.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "50634258", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50634258", "title": "Nockherberg", "text": "Nockherberg\n\nNockherberg is the name of a small terrace on the slope of the eastern bank of the Isar in Munich, situated in the urban district of Au. An annual beer festival rich in tradition takes place there in the Paulaner Brewery - the \"Salvator-Ausschank auf dem Nockherberg\" The name of the raised terrace is often used synonymously for this festival or its opening event, the tapping of the first barrel of a strong, seasonal beer (\"Starkbieranstich\").\n\nThe name of the Nockherberg and two nearby streets can be traced back to the banking family Nockher. The family had settled in Munich in the 18th century and built a summer house on the eastern Isar heights in 1789, the so-called ‘Nockher palace’. It was located on the street known today as 'Am Nockherberg'.\n\nThe Nockherberg terrace is situated in the district of Au-Haidhausen. From the Nockherberg, (approx 535 m above sea level), the terrain descends north-west towards the Isar for approximately 20 metres. Below the hill, the street ‘Am Neudeck’ with the former correctional facility is located. To the north is the Mariahilfplatz and in a south-westerly direction the old Paulaner breweries.\n\nFrom Neudeck, the road ‘Am Nockherberg’, formerly named Ohlmüller Street, snakes up the mountainside and merges into Sankt Bonifatius Street at the top. The new brewery buildings between Reger Street in the east and Hoch Street in the west form the north-eastern part of the Nockherberg, with a rail connection to München Ost station. Hoch Street forks off Nockerberg street near the top and joins it again via the small ‘Zacherlweg’.\n\nAcross the street ‘Am Nockherberg’ from the new brewery area there is an urban park named 'Kronepark', which is situated on the south-western part of the hill and includes a playground. 'Kronepark' was built in 1958 on land owned by the former circus director and his widow Ida Krone, who died in 1957. Several flights of steps lead down to Nockher Street, formerly ‘Bei den Jägerhäusln’, where the road proceeds westwards below the park. A social science research centre, the stands here. Columbus Square is situated at the south-western end of Nocker Street.\n\nThe strong beer festival takes place annually during Lent in the Paulaner main hall at Hoch Street 77. It starts around St Joseph's Day (19 March) and lasts for 17 days, the period being called the strong beer time or Munich's . The festival is associated with the traditional ‘Holy Father Feast’ on April 2, commemorating Francis of Paola, founder of the Paulaner religious order.\n\nWith its , light music and huge crowd of visitors, today's \"Salvator-Ausschank\" resembles the pole marquees at the Munich Oktoberfest. On the Nockherberg, beer is not served in usual beer glasses, but in , tankards made of robust earthenware. The sturdy tankards keep the beer cool longer and also make ‘undemonstrative’ refilling possible.\n\nServing strong beer at Lent can be traced back to a regulation from the religious order of the monastery in Neudeck ob der Au. The Paulaner monks have brewed beer in the monastery for their own consumption at least since 1634. Their nutrition was, on principle, very modest, even more so during Lent, and therefore they were permitted to brew a stronger version of their ‘liquid bread’ during this time of fasting. This strong beer, that has been brewed every year in spring since 1651, was named the ‘Holy Father Beer’ in honour of the founder of the order; later it was given the name \"Salvator\" beer. The monks later sold Salvator beer also to the public – mainly to supply the poor rural population with a nourishing drink during Lent, but also to supplement the monastery's income.\n\nIn the 18th century the Bavarian elector was habitually invited to the annual tapping of the first keg of strong beer on April 2 and he was served the first mug of beer. In a mandate dated 31 March 1751, elector Maximilian III. Joseph explicitly permitted the public serving of beer on the feast day of Francis of Paola. On 26 February 1780, Karl Theodor, elector of Bavaria since 1777, permitted the Paulaner monks to serve beer to the public year-round. The ‘Holy Father Feast’ of 1799, at which the whole court of elector Maximilian IV. Joseph participated, was the city's largest Volksfest up to that date. However, that same year the monastery of Neudeck was disbanded. The brewery located opposite the monastery was expropriated in the course of secularisation and initially sold to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in 1803.\n\nIn 1806, master brewer (1772–1849) took a lease on the Paulaner brewery and eventually purchased it in 1813, whereby the brewery became an ordinary commercial undertaking. 'Zacherlweg' at the Nockherberg is a street named after him. Zacherl continued the tradition of annual strong-beer tapping on 2 April and the festive sale of beer (\"Ausschank\") in the following Octave (eight days). Towards the middle of the 19th century, the first tapping shifted to March and the strong beer time was extended. In 1861, the \"Salvator-Ausschank\" started the Sunday before St. Joseph's Day and lasted for 12 days. Starting in 1858, the brewery arranged for performances by Gstanzl singers and to increase business. During the tapping in 1891, the first \"Salvator speech\" was held. After an interruption from 1939 to 1950 due to World War II, the strong beer festival reappeared in its present form, during which individual politicians were made fun of in clever speeches; the German term for being subjected to this kind of friendly insult is \"derbleckt\".\n\nThe only violent event in the history of the town festival occurred on 23 May 1888, when a trivial quarrel turned into a mass brawl between soldiers and civilians. When an artillerist drew his sabre, a fight broke out in which walking-sticks and beer mugs were also put to good use, causing a relatively large number of injuries. The fight spread throughout the hall and into the garden. Neither the gendarmes nor the jail guard from Neudeck could control the mob, so a 50-man unit of Heavy Cavalry was called, who rode into the hall swinging their sabres. When the conflict broke out there had been only one gendarmerie sergeant on duty at the Nockherberg. In a later investigation this was considered the reason for the inability to control the escalation. It was also claimed that irritation caused by an increase in the price of Salvator beer was the underlying reason for the wrath of the festival guests. The 'scandal year' 1888 remained a topic of conversation in Munich for many years.\n\nThe \"Salvator-Ausschank\" did not originally take place on the Nockherberg but in the old brewery at Neudeck, on the corner of Falken Street and Ohlmüller Street. In 1822, the \"Zacherlgarten\" inn was constructed on the grounds of the Paulaner garden to facilitate year-round drinking of Lent beer; it existed until 2008. From 1846 until 1860, beer was tapped in the so-called \"Neudecker Garden\" on a field nearby. In 1858, banker Georg Nockher sold his summer residence on the Nockherberg to the Paulaner brewery (called \"Zacherlbräu\" at that time), and it was turned into a beer garden. Starting in spring 1861, beer was served only here in the new \"Zacherl-Keller\", renamed the \"Salvator-Keller\" in 1928. The inn \"Zum Nockhergarten\", the former Nockher palace (\"Nockherschlösschen\"), was razed in 1903/1904.\n\nDuring World War II the brewery gallery with its massive arches was used as the command post of Munich's air-raid defence headquarters. Part of the building was also made available to the public as a shelter. The cellar was completely destroyed during a bombing raid on 24 April 1944. The new \"Salvator-Keller\", designed by professor Franz Zell, reopened on 11 March 1950.\n\nOn 28 August 1965, the extreme right-wing NPD held its first federal party conference in the \"Salvator-Keller\". In the night of 27 to 28 November 1999, the cellar, now called \"Paulaner-Keller\", was almost entirely destroyed by arson. Firefighting operations with 89 fire engines lasted for two days. The resulting damage amounted to approximately 15 million euros. In spite of intensive efforts, the offender has so far not been identified amongst 650 suspects. In March 2004, 39-year-old Karl R., known as the \"step-brother\" of Nockherberg publican Peter Pongratz and relative of the Fischer-Vroni family, was remanded in custody as a suspect in the crime. However, he was released after a few months for lack of evidence.\n\nIn the years 2000 to 2002, the \"Salvator-Ausschank\" took place in a specially-built tent on the Mariahilfplatz below the Nockherberg. The \"Paulaner-Keller\" was torn down in 2001 and in 2003 replaced by a newly constructed above-ground Paulaner festive hall, which offers room for up to 2500 customers. The reconstruction cost around 25 million euros. One of the rooms in the vaulted cellar of the new inn \"Paulaner am Nockherberg\" is now once again called the \"Salvatorkeller\". The fountain, famous from television advertising, is located in the beer garden, which has again been accessible since 2003.\n\nThe kick-off event of the annual \"Salvator-Ausschank\" is the tasting of the first strong beer of the \"fifth season\", attended by many regional and federal Bavarian politicians. Due to since 1982, the tapping of the strong beer keg on the Nockherberg and the subsequent program can be viewed by a wide audience. The television broadcast in 2004 had approximately 2.8 million viewers. In 2015, the live-broadcast was followed by 2.8 million viewers Germany-wide, of which 2.05 million were Bavarian viewers.\n\nThe event begins with an actual beer tasting. The first Maß, which was originally presented to the prince-elector, has been handed to the Bavarian minister-president since 1965. The head of the brewery passes him the mug with the traditional words: \"Salve pater patriae! Bibas, princeps optime!\" (lat. \"Be welcome, father of the fatherland! Drink, best prince!\"). However, the present \"father of the nation\" is not expected to carry out the traditional Salvator test, which would not function anyway because the recipe has been modified; originally, Lenten beer was considered to be strong enough only if a bench drenched with the beer would adhere to a person's Lederhosen when he attempted to stand up.\n\nThe highlight of the event is the \"\" of politicians, a political cabaret in front of invited guests, consisting of a speech followed by a Singspiel. In both contributions current Munich issues as well as sharp commentaries on regional and federal politics are presented in cleverly worded ironic statements and more or less heavy sideswipes aimed at politicians of all parties. For a Bavarian politician, not being \"derbleckt\", meaning not being taken for a ride in the festive contributions, can almost be interpreted as a sign of one's irrelevance or lack of a distinctive personality.\n\nIn 1991, the Nockerberg beer festival was cancelled due to the Gulf War, and in 2003 due to the Iraq War. In 2009 the event was scheduled for 12 March but postponed to the end of the \"Salvator-Ausschank\" period on 2 April because of the Winnenden school shooting.\n\n\"\" (Bavarian for 'making fun of someone') can be traced back to the tradition of an innkeeper greeting his guests. In former times he was apt to know all the villagers by name and was quite familiar with the all the local stories and rumours. Regular guests were frequently teased with those stories by humorous and self-confident innkeepers. For events where the guests were to be welcomed in a similar way, rhetorically less talented innkeepers or hosts ordered professional or Gstanzl singers who informed themselves about the guests' peculiarities and sensitivities beforehand. The victims of mockery were expected to take it with good grace, since any offense taken would give rise to even greater public amusement.\n\nThis tradition is still cultivated today. Since the 'victims' are invited guests, overly rude or insulting criticism, which would reflect on the host (or the brewery itself) is prohibited. Consequently, the authors of the festive contributions strive to put forth particularly critical 'attacks' indirectly, with clever wording, or with a wink.\n\nThe first Salvator speaker was humourist Jakob Geist in 1891. In 1922 he was followed by actor Weiß Ferdl, master of ceremonies Adolf Gondrell, Gstanzl singer Roider Jackl and radio host Emil Vierlinger, who organised the radio broadcasting of the \"Derblecken\" on the Nockherberg after World War II. After his serious illness in the 1970s, Michl Lang, Klaus Havenstein, Franz Schönhuber, Ernst Maria Lang, and finally the actor and Paulaner spokesperson Walter Sedlmayr (1982–1990) took over.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2010 the speakers (with the exception of 2007) performed the role of the monk Bruder Barnabas, who holds a Lenten \"sermon\" for the guests. The role can be traced back to the Paulaner monk Friar Barnabas (1750–1795), whose original name was Valentin Stephan Still. He became a master brewer in Munich in 1774 and is said to have invented the basic recipe for the modern Salvator strong beer.\n\nThe first Salvator speaker who performed in the historical role of Brother Barnabas was Max Grießer (1992–1996), followed by Erich Hallhuber (1997–1998). Hallhuber insisted on being permitted to change the text of speechwriter Hannes Burger, while Burger himself insisted on a verbatim performance of his text. Due to this argument Hallhuber cancelled his performance at short notice in 1999. His successor Gerd Fischer (1999–2003) presented his sermons in a tone that benevolently pitied those he \"derbleckt\". With the cabaret artist Bruno Jonas (2004–2006) the Lenten sermons again became more sharp-tongued. In 2007, the Lower Bavarian cabaret artist Django Asül gave the Salvator speech without a cowl. From 2008 to 2010, the former Edmund Stoiber-double Michael Lerchenberg gave the Lenten sermon again in the role of Brother Barnabas.\n\nThe author Hannes Burger wrote the \"commemorative\" \"Derblecken\" speeches for 22 years, from 1982 until 2003. Since 2004 the speakers have written their own texts. In the years 2008 to 2010, cabaret artist Christian Springer was co-author of the Lenten sermons. He resigned as \"Derblecker\", as did speaker Michael Lechrenberg, after some public figures, including Guido Westerwelle, Christine Haderthauer, and Charlotte Knobloch were offended by the content of their sermons.\n\nSince 2011 Luise Kinseher has given the Salvator speech (status: 2016). She is the first female to do so. She performs in the role of Mama Bavaria, whom she personified during the \"Singspiel\" in 2010.\n\nThe commemorative speech is followed by the \"Salvatorspiel\" in which numerous politicians are parodied. Until 1985 the singspiel was stage-managed by Olf Fischer, then, until 1988, by the leading BR entertainment head Helmut Kirchhammer, who also guided the team of authors. Until 2009, under the direction of Eva Demmelhuber, the singing cabaret was gradually expanded into a real stage performance with a new theme and stage setting every year. In the year 2010 Alfons Biedermann took over the direction. For the first time newly composed songs were provided by Matin Lingnau (music) and Heiko Wohlgemuth (texts).\n\nOne of the main authors of the Salvatorspiel was Holger Paetz from 1999 to 2009, who also portrayed FDP politician Guido Westerwelle. Particularly well known actors were also Walter Fitz as Franz Josef Strauß, Michael Lerchenberg as Edmund Stoiber, co-author Ulli Bauer as Munich's mayor Christian Ude, Corinna Duhr as Angela Merkel, as well as Veronika Fitz, Georg Blädel, André Hartmann, Max Grießer, and Klaus Havenstein. After the singspiel the attendant politicians were photographed by the cameras of the journalists and television stations together with the actors who parodied them. The singspiel has been show-managed by Marcus H. Rosenmüller since 2013.\n\nThe traditional Salvator festival inspired numerous artists in Munich. Poems and drawings with the strong beer and the serving of this on the Nockherberg as a motif abounded, many of which can be found in the brewery's guestbook, or were published in Munich magazines, including input from well-known authors such as Karl Valentin and Paul Heyse. The operetta \"Salvator\" (music by Theo Rupprecht, text by Max Ferner, Philipp Wichand and ) premiered in Munich in 1911 featuring Father Barnabas as a central character, and served as the model for the 1952 film \"Monks, Girls and Hungarian Soldiers\".\n\nEduard Ille (1823–1900), painter, illustrator, caricaturist, and author from Munich become a Salvator poet. In many contributions to the humorous magazine Fliegende Blätter he glamourized Salvator beer and its 'founder' Father Barnabas. In the following poem he describes the electoral beer tasting, which took place in March. It can almost be considered a hymn to Lenten beer.\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em; font-style:italic;\">\nWhen in March nigh Passion Sunday / springtime once again was near,\nrode – to honour an old custom – / he himself, our Lord Elector \nup to Neudeck ob der Au, / Paulaner brewery was his goal.\nThere our sovereign Lord was greeted / by Barnabas, the brewery monk,\nwho with delight and full of joy / offered him a mug of beer \nwith a greeting that evermore / a common saying did remain:\n\"Salve, pater patriae! / Bibas, princeps optime!\"\n</poem>\n\nThe high terrain at the Nockherberg, which was formed almost 10,000 years ago, provided not only a safe location and storage place for the population of Au but also a supply of water and energy which they used in creative ways, not only for breweries.\n\nIn the Tertiary, a sea periodically extended from the foot of the Alps to the highlands of the Bavarian Forest. This sea was filled increasingly with weathering material from the Alps. The finest and youngest deposition layer of the Tertiary (upper fresh water molasse of the Miocene), the , now forms a water runoff, known as a soil horizon, which retains groundwater. For this reason springs emerge from the hillsides in the Isartal at several places in Munich, as can be observed at Spring Street, beneath the northern Hoch Street. These springs played an important role in the drinking water supply of the local population at least until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nDuring the ice ages of the Quaternary, glaciers and meltwater covered the Flinz with rough erosion- and weathering material from the Alps, which formed the . Since further erosion occurred, only the last two gravel layers remained in the Giesinger region. The Giesinger gravel area formed terraces, along with the neighbouring Harlachinger gravel area four to ten metres higher. Towards the end of the last ice age, approximately 10,000 years ago, the Isar dug its present valley, known as the Au, out of these terraces. Thus, beside the sloping edge along Nockherberg and Hoch street, further uplands in this area, for example the Drum mountain with the ramp of Candid Street, 'Am Bergsteig' and the Giesinger mountain, emerged as well. Since the steep street gradients of over 12% constructed there proved to be a significant traffic obstruction, several elaborate slope modifications were undertaken between 1890 and 1935. At the Nockherberg, the re-design took place in the years 1904/1905, whereby the former Nocker palace was demolished. Likewise, since 1904, the Nockherberg stairway connects Hoch Street in front of the Paulaner brewery with Ohlmüller Street at the foot of the Nockherberg.\nBetween approximately 1150 and 1301, the lords of Giesing were said to have had a manorhouse at the Nockherberg near today's Ruhe Street. Ownership of the estate at the Nockherberg can be traced from the 15th century up to the time of its sale to the Nockher family on 13 July 1789.\n\nThe edge of the terrace on and nearby 'Berg' formerly provided ideal conditions for many breweries to construct storage cellars and deep-water wells. From the early 19th century onwards, nearly all of the city's 60 breweries had built summer beer cellars on the Isar hillside in the Au, as well as in Haidhausen. The transition from being only a storage and sales operation to a summertime beer-serving inn is generally perceived as the beginning of the Bavarian beer garden tradition. The Paulander brewery transported the water needed for brewing from their own 10-metre-deep wells. The tunnel used still exists and can be viewed in the course of a tour through the brewery.\n\nToday, water for brewing is provided by wells which have a depth of 210–240 m.\n\nThe Auer Mühlbach, a tributary of the Isar, runs between Nockherberg and Neudeuck and has appeared above ground at this location only since 2002. The formerly wild stream has played a significant role in providing energy since the Middle Ages. In 1816 it drove a total of 60 water wheels in the Au. From 1881, this urban stream was used to power the chiller invented by Carl von Linde. This ice machine made it possible for the Paulander brewery to brew beer year-round, and it can still be viewed today.\n\n\n"}

The breakfast marks the traditional beginning to Grand Final day and is one of the biggest social highlights on the Australian sporting calendar. Watching the event is a ritual for many footy fans and the function plays a huge role in the pre match build up for the Grand Final.\n\nThe first Grand Final Breakfast was held in 1967 at the Southern Cross hotel, as a valuable fundraising event. The inaugural guest speaker was the VFL's Administrative director Eric McCutchan. The event rose to prominence in the 1970s when the breakfast began to be televised across Victoria, and was officially endorsed by the VFL as the official pre-match Grand Final function. Since then the event has grown into a significant money raiser for North Melbourne, and the guest list has grown to include Prime Ministers, State Premiers and other celebrities.\n\nAlthough many clubs hold their own Grand Final Breakfasts, the North Melbourne Breakfast was the first breakfast and is currently the only breakfast to be officially endorsed by the AFL. This ensures a guest list that reads as a 'who's who' of Australian business, sport, entertainment and politics. The breakfast includes a Grand Auction, with all proceeds being donated to the Starlight Children's Foundation.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Bob Hawke described the event as\n“one of this nation’s great traditions”.\n\nPaul Keating referred to the function as\n“a tradition in itself”\n\nPrime Minister John Howard described it as\n“a tremendous institution …. and the most eclectic gathering of people you could possibly imagine”. \n\n"}

He has written widely about his ideas and in Finland is a prominent, and highly controversial, thinker. Linkola was a year-round fisherman from 1959 to 1995. He has fished on Keitele, Päijänne and Gulf of Finland, and since 1978 he fishes on Vanajavesi.\n\nLinkola blames humans for the continuous degradation of the environment. He promotes rapid population decline in order to combat the problems commonly attributed to overpopulation.\n\nLinkola grew up in Helsinki, spending his summers in the countryside at the farm of his grandfather Hugo Suolahti. His father Kaarlo Linkola was a botanist and phytogeographer and the Rector of Helsinki University, and his grandfather had worked as the chancellor of that same university. Pentti Linkola chose not to continue his zoological and botanical studies after his first year. \n\nLinkola is considered one of Finland's most famous ornithologists, but gave up his research career to live an austere life as a fisherman.\n\nLinkola believes that democracy is a mistake and only radical change can prevent ecological collapse. He contends that the human populations of the world, regardless if they are developed or underdeveloped, do not deserve to survive at the expense of the biosphere as a whole. In May 1994, Linkola was featured on the front page of \"The Wall Street Journal Europe\". He said he was for a radical reduction in the world population and was quoted as saying about a future world war, \"If there were a button I could press, I would sacrifice myself without hesitating, if it meant millions of people would die.\" \n\nLinkola's writings describe in emotional detail the environmental degradation he has witnessed. He dedicated his 1979 \"Toisinajattelijan päiväkirjasta\" (\"From the Diary of a Dissident\") to Andreas Baader and Ulrike Meinhof, stating that \"they are the signposts, not Jesus of Nazareth or Albert Schweitzer.\"\n\nPaul G. Harris, Chair Professor of Global and Environmental Studies at the Education University of Hong Kong, contends that while most environmentalists in Finland have distanced themselves from Linkola, those concerned about the environment avidly read his writings. Harris asserts that Linkola represents \"a very Finnish and dark version of 'an inconvenient truth'.\"\n\nIn 1995, Linkola founded the Finnish Nature Heritage Foundation (\"Luonnonperintösäätiö\"). It concentrates on preserving the few ancient forests still left in southern Finland and other nature conservation. The forests are donated to the foundation.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was released in September 2005 as the first single from their fifth studio album, \"All the Right Reasons\". The song made multiple US and UK top 10 charts, peaking at #1 in several of them.\n\nThe music video begins with Chad Kroeger, the video's protagonist, walking along a lonely, sparsely populated street, holding up a photograph of himself and Nickelback's producer, Joey Moi (who is referred to in the line \"And what the hell is on Joey's head?\"). As the song progresses to the line \"And this is where I grew up,\" he walks to a rusty mailbox, addressed as number 29025. As he speaks of sneaking out, the camera does not show the house itself but does show a view from the inside looking out at him, possibly suggesting someone else lives there now. He continues walking and comes to an older building marked as \"Hanna High School\" on the front (it's now the Community Services Building: 210 6 Avenue East, Hanna, Alberta, Canada) announcing, \"And this is where I went to school.\" He and his three other band members enter the gym with their gear and put on a seemingly impromptu concert alone. During the chorus, two band members go to an old junkyard and reminisce about a field where the rest of the band and their girlfriends are partying. Another experiences a similar event near an abandoned train yard, seeing his old girlfriend (most likely Kim, who was \"the first girl I kissed\") run near the tracks and kiss his younger self. The Hanna Roundhouse is shown. The camera then switches to flashbacks of various people (\"I miss that town, I miss the faces\") As the video ends, the flashback people get in their cars to go home as the band finishes the song.\n\nThe video was directed by Nigel Dick and was filmed in Hanna, Alberta, Canada, hometown to the majority of the band.\n\nCD single\n\n2008 CD single (UK re-release)\n\nThe single became the band's third top ten hit in the United States, peaking at number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. (Held from the top spot by Kanye West's \"Gold Digger\") \"Photograph\" has sold over 1.4 million digital downloads in the U.S., according to Nielsen SoundScan, though it is certified Gold by the RIAA. \"Photograph\", was the first of three top ten hits from \"All the Right Reasons\" in New Zealand, peaking at number 4.\n\nThe song also topped the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and Pop 100 charts.\nThe single was also a huge success on the Canadian charts, peaking at number-one and staying there for seven weeks.\n\nIn 2008, the single was once again showing on future single release lists in the UK. The single was re-released on 23 June 2008 to capitalise on the success of \"Rockstar\". \"Photograph\" was added to the C-list at BBC Radio 1 on 21 May 2008, climbing to the B-list the following week, and then to the A-List. It was also added to the BBC Radio 2 C-list. \"Photograph\" originally peaked at number 29 upon its first release, three years earlier. The song re-entered the UK Singles Chart at number 52 on 10 June 2008, climbed to number 29 a week later and reached a peak of number 18, two weeks after the physical release, outpeaking the original release of the song.\n\n"}

With these weapons it conducted an armed campaign against the British state in Northern Ireland.\n\nIn the early stages of the Troubles, during the period 1969–1972, the Provisional IRA was poorly armed. They had access to weapons remaining from the IRA's failed Border Campaign between 1956 and 1962, but these weapons were outdated and unsuitable for a modern campaign.\n\nAfter 1969, and the split with the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA gained control of a majority of the stockpiled weaponry still held from previous IRA campaigns. They found that the stockpiles consisted mostly of World War II small arms ranging from Lee–Enfield and M1 Garand and M1 carbine rifles, to MP40 and Thompson submachine guns (SMG), plus Bren light machine guns (LMG) and Webley revolvers. The Garands were used in IRA operations as late as the summer of 1976, when a British army patrol in South Armagh was fired on by one of these rifles loaded with armour-piercing ammunition.\n\nTo continue and escalate their armed campaign, the IRA needed to be better equipped, which meant securing modern small arms. In previous campaigns weapons had been secured before hostilities commenced via raids on British Army and even Irish Army weapons depots. In the 1969–1971 period this was no longer feasible. By 1972, the IRA had large quantities of modern small arms, particularly Armalite rifles, manufactured and purchased in the United States. The AR-18 rifle in particular was found to be very well suited for guerrilla warfare as its small size and folding stock meant that it was easy to conceal. Moreover, it was capable of rapid fire and fired a high velocity round which provided great \"stopping power\".\n\nThe IRA's main gun runner in the United States was George Harrison, an IRA veteran, resident in New York since 1938. Harrison bought guns for the IRA from a Corsican arms dealer named George de Meo, who had connections in organised crime. Joe Cahill acted as the contact between NORAID and Harrison. In 1971, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had already seized 700 modern weapons from the IRA, including 2 tonnes of high explosive and 157,000 rounds of ammunition, most of which were of American manufacture.\n\nHarrison spent an estimated US$1 million in the 1970s purchasing over 2,500 guns for the IRA. According to Brendan Hughes, an IRA member who later became Officer Commanding of the IRA inside Long Kesh prison, the IRA smuggled small arms from the United States by sea on \"\"Queen Elizabeth 2\"\" from New York via Southampton, through Irish members of her crew, until the network was cracked down on by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the 1980s. These \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" shipments included M16, CAR-15, AR-18 and AR-15 Armalite rifles, accompanied by Browning pistols and Smith & Wesson pistols and revolvers and were driven from Southampton to Belfast in small consignments.\n\nIn the late 1970s, another IRA member, Gabriel Megahey, was sent to the United States to acquire more arms and he was able to procure more AR-15 Armalites, plus a number of Heckler & Koch rifles and other weapons. Again, the purchase of these weapons was funded by Irish American republicans. A batch of M60 machine guns was imported in 1977.\n\nHarrison was arrested by the FBI in 1981, but acquitted at his trial. Megahey was arrested by the FBI in 1982 after a successful sting operation, where he was trying to purchase surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) for the IRA, and sentenced to seven years in prison.\n\nIn 1984, the FBI warned the Republic of Ireland that a major IRA arms shipment was underway from the United States, and that the weaponry would be transferred to an Irish fishing trawler in the Atlantic. Subsequently, Irish authorities discovered that arms ship was a vessel named \"Marita Ann\", allegedly after a tip off from Sean O'Callaghan, a Garda Síochána intelligence agent within the IRA. Three Irish Naval Service ships confronted the vessel off the coast of County Kerry, and prevented its escape by firing warning shots. A team of naval personnel and Garda officers boarded the ship, arresting the crew of five and confiscating seven tons of military equipment, as well as medications, training manuals, and communications equipment. The weapons had been donated by the South Boston Winter Hill Irish Mob.\n\nThe other source of IRA arms in the 1970s was the leader of the Libyan Arab Republic, Muammar Gaddafi, who was engaging in a strategy at this time of opposing the United States' hegemony over the Arab world by sponsoring paramilitary activity against it and its allies in Western Europe.\n\nThe first Libyan arms shipment to the IRA took place in 1972–1973, following visits by Joe Cahill to Libya. In early 1973, the Government of the Republic of Ireland received intelligence that the vessel \"Claudia\" was carrying a consignment of weapons, and placed the ship under surveillance on 27 March. On 28 March, three Irish Navy patrol vessels intercepted the \"Claudia\" in Irish territorial waters near Helvick Head, County Waterford, seizing five tonnes of Libyan small arms and ammunition found on board. The weaponry seized included 250 Soviet-made small arms, 240 rifles, anti-tank mines and other explosives. Cahill himself was also found and arrested on board the vessel. It is estimated that three other shipments of weaponry of a similar size and nature succeeded in getting through to the IRA in the same time period. Journalist Ed Moloney reports that the early Libyan arms shipments provided the IRA with its first RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, and that Gaddafi also gave three to five million U.S. dollars at this time to the organisation to finance its activities. However contact with the Libyan government was broken off in 1976.\n\nContact with Libya was opened again in the aftermath of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which was said to have impressed Gadaffi. In the 1980s, the IRA received further larger quantities of weaponry and explosives from the Libyan Government, reportedly enough to equip least two professional infantry battalions. Four shipments of guns, ammunition and explosives were made between 1985 and 1986, providing large quantities of modern weaponry to the IRA, including heavy machine guns, over 1,000 rifles, several hundred handguns, rocket-propelled grenades, flamethrowers, surface-to-air missiles, and Semtex explosive. – an odourless explosive, invisible to X-ray, and many times more powerful than fertiliser. From late 1986 to 2011, virtually every bomb constructed by the Provisional IRA, and splinter groups such as the Real IRA, contained Semtex from a Libyan shipment unloaded at an Irish pier in 1986.\n\nThese shipments were in retaliation for the British Government's support for the US Air Force's (USAF) bombing attacks on Tripoli and Benghazi in 1986, which in turn were in retaliation for the 1986 bombing of the LaBelle discotheque in Berlin. The USAF planes involved in the bombings had taken off from British bases on 14 April 1986, and Libya reportedly suffered 60 casualties in the attack. This second major Libyan contribution to the IRA came in 1986–1987.\n\nThere were four shipments which were not intercepted, in a huge intelligence failure of both Irish and British agencies described as 'calamitous' by journalist Brendan O'Brien. The arm supplies from Libya developed as follows:\n\nIn total, the arms shipments included: \n\n\nIt is also estimated that the Libyan government gave the IRA the equivalent of £2 million along with the 1980s shipments.\n\nHowever, on 1 November 1987, during transit to Ireland, one-third of the total Libyan arms consignment being carried aboard the MV \"Eksund\" was intercepted by the French Navy while the ship was in the Bay of Biscay, along with five crew members, among them Gabriel Cleary. The vessel was found to contain 120 tonnes of weapons, including HMGs, 36 RPGs, 1000 detonators, 20 SAMs, Semtex and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition. Ed Moloney claimed that the \"Eksund\" shipment also contained military mortars and a 106-millimetre cannon, an assertion never confirmed by the Irish authorities. Despite the \"Eksund\" fiasco, the IRA was by then equipped with a quantity and quality of weaponry and explosives never available to them at any other phase of their history. Furthermore, according to Brendan O'Brien there was actually an 'over-supply', especially regarding the 600 AK-47s still in the hands of the IRA by 1992.\n\nThe Garda Síochána (the Police Service of the Republic of Ireland) uncovered numerous arms destined for the IRA in 1988. These included several hundred AK-47s, Russian DSHK HMGs, FN MAG machine guns and Semtex.\n\nBy 1996, \"Jane's Intelligence Review\" reported that \"it is believed that the bulk of the material presently in IRA arsenals was shipped from Libya in the mid-1980s with the aid of a skipper, Adrian Hopkins, hired for the purpose by the IRA.\"\n\nOn 31 October 2009, a cross-party delegation of Northern Irish politicians travelled to the Libyan capital Tripoli for the first face to face meeting with Libyan government ministers to discuss compensation claims for victims of IRA violence.\n\nAs well as these major sources of arms, the IRA also bought weapons on a smaller scale from various arms dealers in continental Europe. In the 1970s, some guns were purchased by Dáithí Ó Conaill in Czechoslovakia and in the 1980s, Belgian FN FNC rifles were obtained, probably smuggled through the Netherlands. \nThere was contact between the IRA and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and specifically the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), starting from the mid-1970s which included the training of IRA volunteers. At one stage, the PLO offered weapons and training to the IRA, but they declined on the grounds that it was impossible to smuggle arms out of the Levant region and Palestine in specific without alerting Israeli intelligence. Tim Pat Coogan wrote that assistance from the PLO largely dried up in the mid-1980s after the PLO had forged stronger links with the government of the Republic of Ireland. AG-3 rifles from Norway were also secretly obtained.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade smuggled in a number of Barrett M82 and Barrett M90 .50 BMG rifles from the United States. These weapons were used by two South Armagh sniper teams to conduct a sniping campaign against British Army patrols operating in the area. The last British soldier killed in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, Stephen Restorick, was shot dead with a Barrett rifle in 1997. Soon after, the leader of one of the Armagh sniper squads, Michael Caraher, was arrested and a Barrett rifle recovered.\n\nDespite their ceasefires of 1994 and 1997 the IRA continued to buy arms. They needed a new source of weapons, since the Libyan pipeline had been closed. In May 1996, the Federal Security Service (FSB), Russia's internal security service, publicly accused Estonia of arms smuggling, and claimed that the IRA had contacted representatives of Estonia's volunteer defence force, Kaitseliit, and some non-government groups to buy weapons. However he did not say when the contacts had taken place. In July 1999, three men, Anthony Smyth, Conor Claxton, and Martin Mullan, along with an accomplice, Siobhan Browne, were arrested by the American FBI and ATF agencies and accused of buying 44 handguns from arms dealers in Florida in the United States and posting 15 of the weapons to Ireland and the United Kingdom. Later estimates put the number of guns sent to Ireland at more than 100 pistols and machine-pistols. All three men were cleared of conspiracy to aid terrorists and to commit murder. They were later sentenced on the less serious smuggling charge. The IRA leadership denied knowledge of the arms buys.\n\n\nFollowing the announcement of their cessation of violence and commitment to exclusively peaceful means, the Provisional IRA decommissioned its arms in July–September 2005. Among the weaponry estimated, (by Jane's Information Group), to have been destroyed as part of this process were:\n\nThe panel overseeing the decommissioning of IRA weaponry and weapons stockpiles, the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD) headed by General de Chastelain oversaw the decommissioning process. The decommissioning process has taken place using estimates of IRA weaponry submitted by the British and Irish Governments. General de Chastelain said he had seen rifles, particularly AK-47s, machine guns, ground-to-air missiles, explosives, explosive material, mortars, flame throwers, hand guns, timer units and ballistic caps, and some weaponry that was \"very old\", including a Bren machine gun.\n\nThe IICD's final report was issued on 26 September 2005 and the panel stated to the press:\n\nWe have observed and verified events to put beyond use very large quantities of arms which we believe include all the arms in the IRA's possession… Our new inventory is consistent with these estimates. We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA's arsenal.\n\nand while they could not report on the quantity or types of weapons destroyed they said:\n\nThe experience of seeing this with our own eyes, on a minute-to-minute basis, provided us with evidence so clear and of its nature so incontrovertible that at the end of the process [IRA weapon decommissioning] it demonstrated to us – and would have demonstrated to anyone who might have been with us – that beyond any shadow of doubt, the arms of the IRA have now been decommissioned.\n\nIrish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern also stated at the time:\n\nThe weapons of the IRA are gone, and are gone in a manner which has been verified and witnessed.\n\nHowever, despite the conclusion of the IICD agreeing with the figures provided by the British security forces, unnamed sources in MI5 and the PSNI have reported to the press that not all IRA arms were destroyed during the process, a claim which so far remains unsubstantiated. These reports have since been scotched by the group overseeing the activities of paramilitaries in Northern Ireland – the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC). In its latest report, dated April 2006, the IMC points out that it has no reason to disbelieve the IRA or information to suspect that the group has not fully decommissioned. Rather, it indicated that any weaponry that had not been handed in had been retained by individuals outside the IRA's control. Excerpt from the IMC's 10th report:\n\nIndeed, our present assessment is that such of the arms as were reported to us as having been retained, would have been withheld under local control despite the instructions of the leadership. We note that, as reported by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning (IICD), the leadership claimed only to have decommissioned all the arms \"under its control\". The relevant points are that the amount of un-surrendered material was not significant in comparison to what was decommissioned and that these reports do not cast doubt on the declared intention of the IRA leadership to eschew terrorism and to follow the political path. We will continue to monitor the position.\n"}

For most others, one's belief that oneself is conscious is offered as an example of self-evidence. However, one's belief that someone else is conscious is not epistemically self-evident.\n\nThe following proposition is often said to be self-evident:\n\nAlso self evident is the statement that two plus two is equal to four.\n\nA logical argument for a self-evident conclusion would demonstrate only an ignorance of the purpose of persuasively arguing for the conclusion based on one or more premises that differ from it (see \"ignoratio elenchi\" and begging the question).\n\nIt is sometimes said that a self-evident proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. It is also sometimes said that an analytic proposition is one whose denial is self-contradictory. But the concepts mean different things.\n\nProvided that one understands and believes a self-evident proposition, self-evident propositions are not in need of proof. Likewise, that their denial is self-contradictory does not have to be proven. It is in this sense that the self-contradictions at work in self-evident and analytic propositions are different.\n\nNot all analytic propositions are self-evident, and it is sometimes claimed that not all self-evident propositions are analytic: e.g. my knowledge that I am conscious.\n\nClaims of \"self-evidence\" also exist outside of epistemology.\n\nIn informal speech, \"self-evident\" often merely means \"obvious\", but the epistemological definition is more strict.\n\nMoral propositions may also be regarded as self-evident. For example, Alexander Hamilton cited the following moral propositions as self-evident in the Federalist No. 37:\n\nA famous claim of the self-evidence of a moral truth is in the United States Declaration of Independence, which states, \"We hold these Truths to be \"self-evident\", that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\"; philosophically, these propositions' self-evidence is debatable.\n\nAnother classic example in epistemology are the claims by the Vedas (Vedanta) to be self-evident.\n\n"}

It was built by John Lancaster for his wife, Ellen Wallis, a well-known Shakespearean actress. The theatre was designed by C. J. Phipps and built by Messrs. Patman and Fotheringham at a cost of £20,000 and opened with a production of \"As You Like It\" on 20 October 1888.\n\nThe theatre had a stage of 28' 6\" square. The capacity was 1,196. It was located on the south side of Shaftesbury Avenue, just east of Gerrard Place.\n\nThe theatre's first big hit was \"The Belle of New York\" produced by the prominent Broadway producer, George W. Lederer, which opened on 12 April 1898 and ran for an extremely successful 697 performances. In 1908–09 H. B. Irving became the lessee and manager of the theatre and presented a successful season of plays. Robert Courtneidge was lessee for most of the early years of the 20th century and produced mostly comic operas and Edwardian musical comedies, including \"Tom Jones\" (1907), the record-setting hit \"The Arcadians\" (1909), \"Oh! Oh! Delphine!\" (1913), \"The Pearl Girl\" and many others. In 1914 Basil Rathbone appeared at the Shaftesbury as the Dauphin in Shakespeare's \"Henry V\".\n\nCourtneidge's successors, from 1917 to 1921 were George Grossmith, Jr. and Edward Laurillard. The produced a number of shows, including \"Arlette\" by Claude M. Ronald and L. Bouvet (1917); \"Baby Bunting\" by Fred Thompson and Worton David (1919); \"The Great Lover\", by Leo Ditrichstein, Frederic Hatton and Fanny Hatton (1920); and \"Out to Win\", by Roland Pertwee and Dion Clayton Calthrop (1921).\n\nIn 1941 the theatre was so severely damaged by aerial bombardment that the lease was vacated, and in 1956 the site was appropriated by the London County Council for use as a fire station. It is at present used as a car park and for advertising purposes.\n\n"}

It was built in 1867 and closed in 1966. The hall could accommodate between 800 and 900 persons, or up to 1,500 persons including the galleries. The architect was John Taylor of Whitehall.\n\nThe hall was known for three decades for its presentation of the German Reed Entertainments alongside other musical works and lectures. After 1895, it was used for vaudeville, drama, magic shows, as the headquarters of the London Academy of Music, and even as a skating rink. In 1933, it became a BBC broadcasting studio but was shut down after extensive damage from bombing in March 1943. The theatre was demolished in 1966, and the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House now stand on the site.\n\nThe hall was built as a concert hall for the New Philharmonic Society and opened on 24 April 1867. The Hall could be used as a theatre, however, and the first production at \"St. George's Theatre\" was \"A Woman's Whim\" by Walter Stephens on 3 December 1867.\n\nSoon afterwards, the theatre was leased by Thomas German Reed, who initially produced and conducted \"The Contrabandista\" (a comic opera by Arthur Sullivan and F. C. Burnand), \"The Beggar's Opera\" and other English operas in small-scale productions. In 1874, Reed's wife, Priscilla German Reed, moved the German Reed Entertainments to St. George's Hall. Like their earlier theatre, the Gallery of Illustration, St. George's had a small stage, and musical works were presented with only piano and harmonium. Thomas retired in 1871, and his son Alfred continued to run the theatre with his mother until her retirement in 1879 and, beginning in 1877, in partnership with Richard Corney Grain, until both their deaths in 1895.\n\nThe pieces premiered there included W. S. Gilbert's farce, \"A Medical Man\" (1872) and his one-act comic opera, \"Eyes and No Eyes\" (1875). John Baldwin Buckstone wrote \"Married Life\", and John Maddison Morton wrote \"Slasher and Crasher\" for the hall, both in 1872. In addition to performances, there were regular lectures in the hall, the Chartist Gerald Massey gave a series of lectures in 1872, on \"Christianity and Spiritualism\". The theist Charles Voysey gave regular Sunday sermons from 1875, after his ejection from the established church. H. G. Wells described a visit to one tedious Sunday lecture in \"Incidental Thoughts on a Bald Head\". When they were not presenting a piece at the hall, it was rented it out to amateurs or other entertainments.\nAt the hall Gilbert Arthur à Beckett presented \"Two Foster Brothers\", composed by Alfred Cellier (1877), and \"Once in a Century\", with music by Vivian Bligh. Henry Pottinger Stephens wrote his first burlesque, \"Back from India\" for the hall in 1879, as well as \"Hobbies\" in 1885, with William Yardley and music by George Gear. \"Cherry Tree Farm\" and \"All at Sea\" played in 1881. The same year, William Poel produced his \"Hamlet\". In the early 1880s, Eric Lewis sometimes substituted at the Hall for Corney Grain. Herbert Gardiner wrote \"A Night in Wales\" (1885) for the hall with music by Corney Grain. Alfred J. Caldicott wrote a number of pieces for the hall, including \"A Treasure Trove\", \"A Moss Rose Rent\" (1883), \"Old Knockles\" (1884), \"In Cupid's Court\" (1885), \"The Friar\" (1886), \"Tally Ho\" (1887), \"Wanted, An Heir and The Boson's Mate\" (1888), \"John Smith\" (1889), \"The Old Bureau\" (1891), and \"An Old Pair\" (1893).\n\nFanny Holland starred in many of the entertainments, along with Mr. and Mrs. German Reed, their son Alfred, Holland's husband Arthur Law, Corney Grain, Arthur Cecil (all of whom also wrote for the hall) Carlotta Carrington and Leonora Braham, who made her professional stage debut in 1870 at the hall in a revival of Gilbert and Clay's \"Ages Ago\", which was revived again there in 1874. Except for a brief stint at the Criterion Theatre in 1874 and at the Savoy Theatre in 1879-80, Holland starred at St. George's until 1895 in entertainments too numerous to name. Many of the entertainments were written by Law, including \"A Night Surprise\" (1877), \"Nobody's Fault\", composed by Hamilton Clarke (1882), and \"A Happy Bungalow\", with music by Charles King Hall. Other pieces from the 1870s starring Holland included \"Number 204\" by F. C. Burnand, with music by Thomas German Reed; and \"Our New Doll’s House\" by W. Wye, with music by Cotsford Dick.\n\nAfter the German Reed Entertainments closed in 1895, the building changed its name to the Matinee Theatre, on 17 April 1897, presenting \"high class vaudeville,\" but it was not very successful. A series of German plays were then produced, but in 1904 the hall closed.\n\nIn 1905, magician John Nevil Maskelyne renovated, expanded and reopened the 'St George's Hall, England's New Home of Mystery,' on 24 January 1905 with \"The Coming Race\" by David Christie Murray and Maskelyne. Maskelyne's entertainments were called \"Maskelyne's Theatre of Mystery.\" The theatre also hosted meetings of The Magic Circle, an association of amateur and professional magicians, and its members David Devant and Maskelyne continued to give magic shows for many years. One was called \"Maskelyne and Devant's Mysteries\", which was presented in August 1910.\n\nThe hall was also used as a \"Bioscope Picture Palace\", although with a reduced capacity of 500. The building also was used as the headquarters of the London Academy of Music. The hall was later converted to use as a skating rink.\n\nSt. George's was finally acquired by Eric Maschwitz for the BBC in 1933 for broadcasts of vaudeville, comedy and revue shows, and opened as a studio on 25 November 1933. The BBC installed the original \"BBC Theatre Organ\" in 1936, a \"Compton Melotone and Electrostatic Organ\", this enabled a wide range of sounds to be produced during performances. Reginald Foort was appointed resident organist. The hall sustained extensive damage from bombing in March 1943, during World War II, and the studios moved to the Aeolian Hall, in New Bond Street.\n\nThe building was demolished in 1966, and together with the site of the adjacent Queens Hall – original home of the Henry Wood promenade concerts – the location was used for the construction of the St Georges Hotel and Henry Wood House.\n\n"}

{"id": "2878844", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2878844", "title": "Ten-Day War", "text": "Ten-Day War\n\nThe Ten-Day War () or the Slovenian Independence War (), was a brief war of independence that followed the Slovenian declaration of independence on 25 June 1991. It was fought between the Slovenian Territorial Defence () and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA). It lasted from 27 June 1991 until 7 July 1991, when the Brioni Accords were signed. It marked the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nFollowing the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito in 1980, underlying political, ethnic, religious, and economic tensions within Yugoslavia surfaced. In 1989 Slobodan Milošević, Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia since 1986, became president of Serbia, the largest and most populous of the six Yugoslav republics. As Milošević moved to consolidate power by centralizing the state, the governments of the other republics sought to loosen the central grip on power by devolving as much constitutional power as possible to each of the republics and autonomous provinces. A series of disagreements among delegates persisted until four of the six republics each made the decision to secede from Yugoslavia. Supported by Germany and the Vatican, Slovenia was among those republics aiming for independence.\n\nThe first action in defence of Slovenian independence, that united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia was, however, carried out by the Slovene police forces, in an action named Action North in 1989. In April 1990, Slovenia held its first democratic multi-party elections, won by the DEMOS coalition.\n\nOn 23 December 1990, Slovenia held a referendum, which passed with 88.5% of overall electorate supporting independence (94.8% of votes cast), with a turnout of 93.3%. The Slovenian government was well aware that the federal government in Belgrade might seek to use military force to quash Slovenia's move towards independence. Immediately after the Slovenian elections, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) announced a new defence doctrine that would apply across the country. The Tito-era doctrine of \"General People's Defence\", in which each republic maintained a Territorial Defence Force (\"Teritorialna obramba\", or TO), was to be replaced by a centrally directed system of defence. The republics would lose their role in defence matters, and their TOs would be disarmed and subordinated to JNA headquarters in Belgrade.\n\nThe Slovenian government resisted these moves and successfully ensured that the majority of Slovenian Territorial Defence (TO) equipment was kept out of the hands of the JNA. It also declared in a constitutional amendment passed on 28 September 1990 that its TO would be under the sole command of the Slovenian government. At the same time, the Slovenian government set up a secret alternative command structure, known as the Manoeuvre Structures of National Protection (\"Manevrska struktura narodne zaščite\", or MSNZ). This was an existing but antiquated institution, unique to Slovenia, which was intended to enable the republic to form an \"ad hoc\" defence structure, akin to a Home Guard. It was of negligible importance prior to 1990, with antiquated weapons and few members. However, the DEMOS-led government realised that the MSNZ could be adapted to provide a parallel organisation to the TO that would be entirely in the hands of the Slovenian government.When the JNA tried to take control of the Slovenian Territorial Defence, the TO's command structure was simply replaced by that of the parallel MSNZ. Between May and October 1990, some 21,000 Slovenian Territorial Defence and police personnel were secretly mobilised into the MSNZ command structure, of which the federal government was wholly unaware. The Slovenian government also undertook detailed planning of a military campaign against the JNA, which resulted in the production of an operational and tactical plan by November 1990 — over seven months before the conflict actually began.\n\nThe Slovenes were aware that they would not be able to deter the JNA forces for an extended period of time. Under Defence Minister Janez Janša, they adopted a strategy based on an asymmetric warfare approach. TO units would carry out a guerrilla campaign, using anti-tank weapons and anti-aircraft missiles to ambush JNA units. Tank columns could be trapped by destroying the lead and rear vehicles in favourable terrain — for instance, on a narrow mountain road where room for manoeuvre was limited – enabling the rest to be tackled more easily. In preparation for this, the Slovenian government covertly bought lightweight missile systems from foreign suppliers, notably the SA-7 Grail (Strela) anti-aircraft missile and the German-designed Armbrust anti-tank system. Hit-and-run and delaying tactics were to be preferred and frontal clashes were to be avoided since in such situations the JNA's superior firepower would have been very difficult to overcome.\n\nSlovenia and Croatia passed the acts about their independence on 25 June 1991. This \"advance\" on the date of independence was a critical element of the Slovenian plan to gain an early advantage in the expected conflict. The Slovenian government fully expected the Yugoslav military to respond with force on the day of the declaration of independence or shortly afterwards. By secretly advancing the date by 24 hours, the Slovenians wrongfooted the Yugoslav government, which had set 26 June as the date for its move.\n\nAlthough the Yugoslav army was adamantly opposed to Slovenian independence, it was divided about what to do. The YPA Chief of Staff, Colonel-General Blagoje Adžić, advocated a large-scale military operation to remove the Slovenian government and bring \"healthy forces\" to power in the republic. His political superior, the Yugoslav Defence Minister General of the Army Veljko Kadijević, insisted on a more cautious approach – essentially a show of force that would convince the Slovenian government to back down on its declaration of independence. After some debate, Kadijević got his way.\n\nIt is unclear how much the civilian members of the Yugoslav government were involved in the decision to resort to force in Slovenia. Ante Marković, the President of the Federal Executive Council (equivalent to Prime Minister) is reported to have said that the federal government had not been informed of the Army's actions.\n\nOn the morning of 26 June, units of the Yugoslav People's Army's 13th Corps left their barracks in Rijeka, Croatia, to move towards Slovenia's borders with Italy. The move immediately led to a strong reaction from local Slovenians, who organized spontaneous barricades and demonstrations against the JNA's actions. There had been no fighting yet, and both sides appeared to have an unofficial policy of not being the first to open fire.\n\nBy this time, the Slovenian government had already put into action its plan to seize control of the republic's border posts and the international airport at Brnik. The personnel manning the border posts were, in most cases, already Slovenians, so the Slovenian take-over mostly simply amounted to changing of uniforms and insignia, without any fighting. This was undertaken, in the words of Janez Janša, to \"establish our sovereignty in the key triangle, border-customs-air control.\" It also had important practical effects. The border crossings were a major source of revenue. In addition, by taking control of the borders, the Slovenians were able to establish defensive positions against an expected JNA attack. This meant that the YPA would have to fire the first shot. It was fired on 27 June at 14:30 in Divača by an officer of YPA.\n\nFurther YPA troop movements took place in the early hours of 27 June. A unit of the YPA's 306th Anti-Aircraft Regiment, based in Karlovac, Croatia, crossed the Slovenian border at Metlika. A few hours later, a column of tanks and armoured personnel carriers of the YPA 1st Armoured Brigade left their barracks at Vrhnika near the Slovenian capital Ljubljana, heading for the airport at Brnik. They arrived a few hours later and took control of the facilities. As the YPA was the federal army, its forces were customarily deployed in various places within the federal republics including Slovenia. To the east, YPA units left Maribor heading for the nearby border crossing at Šentilj and the border town of Dravograd further west. The Yugoslav Air Force aircraft dropped leaflets over various parts of Slovenia bearing the messages \"We invite you to peace and cooperation!\" and \"All resistance will be crushed.\"\n\nIn the early hours of 27 June the Slovenian leadership was told of the movements of the YPA. The military leadership of the Fifth Military District, which included Slovenia, was in telephone contact with Slovenian president Milan Kučan, telling him that the troops' mission was limited to taking over the border crossings and airport. A meeting of the Slovene presidency was hastily convened at which Kučan and the rest of the members decided on armed resistance.\nThe Slovenian government had received warnings that the YPA would use helicopters to ferry special forces troops to strategic locations. It issued a warning to the YPA's 5th Military Command District in Zagreb that if helicopters continued to be used they would be shot down. The warning was disregarded by the YPA leadership, which still believed that the Slovenians would back down rather than fight. This was, however, a disastrous miscalculation. In the afternoon of 27 June, the Slovenian TO (Slovenian Territorial Defence) shot down two YPA helicopters with SA-7 missiles, one of them a Gazelle over Rožna Dolina, Ljubljana, killing the occupants (one of whom, Toni Mrlak, was a Slovenian pilot, as the YPA's forces consisted of nationals from all the republics).\nThe Slovenian Territorial Defence also took up positions around YPA barracks in various locations, effectively besieging them, and launched a series of attacks on YPA forces across Slovenia. At Brnik, a Slovenian TO unit attacked the YPA troops holding the airport, and at Trzin a firefight developed in which four YPA soldiers and one Slovenian TO soldier (Edvard Peperko) were killed and the remainder of the YPA unit was forced to surrender. Attacks were also launched by Slovenian TO units on YPA tank columns at Pesnica, Ormož and Koseze near Ilirska Bistrica. A tank column from the YPA's 32nd Mechanised Brigade, advancing from Varaždin in Croatia, was blocked at Ormož near the Slovenian border and found itself unable to break through a Slovenian barricade.\n\nDespite the confusion and fighting, the YPA nonetheless successfully accomplished much of its military mission. By midnight on 27 June it had captured all of the crossings along the Italian border, all but three crossings on the Austrian border and several of the new crossing points established along Slovenia's border with Croatia. However, many of its units were still stuck in vulnerable positions across Slovenia.\nDuring the night of 27–28 June, Slovenian TO units were ordered to undertake a general offensive against the YPA. The Slovenian defence ministry ordered:\n\nAt all locations where RS (Republic of Slovenia) armed forces (Slovenian Territorial Defence) have the tactical advantage, offensive actions against enemy units and facilities will be carried out. The enemy will be summoned to surrender, the shortest deadline possible for surrender given and action taken using all available weapons. While in action, any necessary arrangements will be made to evacuate and protect the civilians.\nAdditional fighting took place throughout the day. The YPA tank column that had been attacked at Pesnica the previous day was blocked by impromptu barricades of Slovenian trucks at Štrihovec, a few miles short of the border with Austria, where it again came under attack by Slovenian TO personnel and Slovenian police. The SFR Yugoslav Air Force mounted two airstrikes in support of the YPA forces at Strihovec, killing four truck drivers. At Medvedjek in central Slovenia, another YPA tank column came under attack at a truck barricade, where air raids killed six truck drivers. Heavy fighting broke out at Nova Gorica on the border with Italy, where the Slovenian Special Forces destroyed three YPA T-55 tanks and captured an additional three. Four YPA soldiers were killed, among them the commander of the armored column, and nearly 100 more surrendered. Some sources claim that this was the decisive battle of the war.\n\nThe border crossing at Holmec was captured by Slovenian TO forces. Two Slovenian and three YPA soldiers were killed, and 91 YPA soldiers captured. The YPA barracks at Bukovje Mansion in Bukovje near Dravograd were attacked by Slovenian TO units and a YPA weapons depot at Borovnica fell to the Slovenian TO, significantly improving the Slovenians' supply of weapons. The Yugoslav Air Force carried out attacks at a number of locations across the country, most notably at Brnik Airport, where two journalists from Austria and Germany (Nikolas Vogel and Norbert Werner) were killed and four Adria Airways airliners were seriously damaged. The Yugoslav Air Force also attacked the Slovenian TO military headquarters at Kočevska Reka and flew sorties against radio and television transmitters at Krim, Kum, Trdina Peak and Nanos in an attempt to silence the Slovenian government broadcasts.\n\nBy the end of the day, the YPA still held many of its positions but was rapidly losing ground. YPA was beginning to experience problems with desertions — many Slovenian members of the YPA quit their units or simply changed sides - and both the troops on the ground and the leadership in Belgrade appeared to have little idea of what to do next.\n\nThe outbreak of the war galvanised diplomatic efforts by the European Community to find an end to the crisis. Three EC foreign ministers met with Slovenian and Yugoslav government representatives in Zagreb during the night of 28–29 June and agreed on a ceasefire plan, but this was not put into practice. In the morning, the Slovenians achieved several significant military successes. The YPA troops at Ljubljana Airport near Brnik surrendered to Slovenian TO forces, who had surrounded the facility overnight. In the north, several YPA tanks were captured near Strihovec and later reorganised into a TO tank company. YPA special forces attempted a maritime landing at Hrvatini but were ambushed and repulsed by the Slovenians. The YPA-held border crossings at Vrtojba and Šentilj also fell to the Slovenian TO, who seized the federal troops' weapons and tanks, providing a much-needed boost to their arsenal.\n\nThe YPA issued an ultimatum to Slovenia, demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities by 09:00 on 30 June. In response, the Slovenian Assembly adopted a resolution calling for a peaceful solution to the crisis that did not jeopardise Slovenian independence, and rejected the YPA ultimatum.\n\nSkirmishing continued in several places during the day. Slovenian forces seized the strategic Karawanken Tunnel under the Alps on the border with Austria and captured nine YPA tanks near Nova Gorica. The entire YPA garrison at Dravograd – 16 officers and 400 men, plus equipment – surrendered, and the garrisons at Tolmin and Bovec also fell to the Slovenians. The weapons captured from the garrisons were quickly re-issued to the Slovenian forces.\n\nMore skirmishes took place, with Slovenian TO forces taking over a YPA facility at Nova vas, south of Ljubljana. The YPA's ammunition dump at Črni Vrh caught fire and was destroyed in a massive explosion, damaging much of the town. However, the Slovenians successfully captured depots at Pečovnik, Bukovžlak, and Zaloška Gorica, taking possession of some 70 truckloads of ammunition and explosives.\n\nThe YPA 306th Light Air Defence Artillery Regiment's column retreated from its exposed position at Medvedjek and headed into the Krakovo Forest (\"Krakovski gozd\") near the Croatian border. It ran into a blockade near the town of Krško and was surrounded by Slovenian forces, but refused to surrender, probably hoping for help from a relief column.\n\nIn the meantime, the YPA's leadership sought permission to change the tempo of its operations. Defence Minister Veljko Kadijević informed the Yugoslav cabinet that the YPA's first plan – a limited operation to secure Slovenia's border crossings – had failed, and that it was time to put into operation the backup plan of a full-scale invasion and imposition of military rule in Slovenia. However, the collective presidency – headed at the time by Serbia's Borisav Jović – refused to authorise such an operation. The YPA Chief of Staff, General Blagoje Adzić, was furious and publicly denounced \"the federal organs [which] continually hampered us, demanding negotiations while they [the Slovenians] were attacking us with all means.\"\n\nThe heaviest fighting of the war to date took place during 2 July. The Domžale radio transmitter was attacked at 10:37 UTC (11:37 local time) and heavily damaged by two YPA Mig-21 planes. During the rest of the day there were a number of major set-backs for the YPA. The YPA convoy in the Krakovo Forest came under sustained attack from TO units, forcing it to surrender. Units from the YPA's Fourth Armoured Brigade attempted to move up from Jastrebarsko in Croatia but were beaten back near the border town of Bregana. The Slovenian TO mounted successful attacks on border crossings at Šentilj, Gornja Radgona, Fernetiči and Gorjansko, overrunning them and taking a number of YPA troops prisoner. A protracted engagement between YPA and Slovenian TO forces took place during the afternoon and evening at Dravograd, and a number of YPA facilities around the country fell to Slovenian forces.\n\nAt 21:00, the Slovenian Presidency announced a unilateral ceasefire. However, this was rejected by the YPA leadership, which vowed to \"take control\" and crush Slovenian resistance.\n\nA large YPA armoured convoy set off from Belgrade on the morning of 3 July, ostensibly to go to Slovenia. It never arrived; according to the official account, this was due to mechanical breakdowns.\n\nFighting continued in Slovenia, with a YPA relief force heading for the Gornja Radgona border crossing being halted near Radenci. YPA forces at the Kog border crossing were also attacked by TO units. In the evening, the YPA agreed to a ceasefire and a withdrawal to barracks. In a separate incident not far from Radenci, in the village of Hrastje-Mota, a Yugoslav Mi-8 helicopter developed mechanical problems and was forced to land. The helicopter was seized by the Slovene military, but was deemed not suitable for the newly born air force and handed back to Belgrade on 13 August.\n\nWith a ceasefire now in force, the two sides disengaged. Slovenian forces took control of all of the country's border crossings, and YPA units were allowed to withdraw peacefully to barracks and to cross the border to Croatia.\n\nThe Ten-Day War was formally ended with the Brioni Accord, signed on the Croatian Brijuni Islands. Slovenian and Croatian independence were agreed to. The terms were distinctly favourable to Slovenia; it was agreed that Slovenia and Croatia would postpone their independence for three months—which in practical terms had little real impact—and the Slovenian police and armed forces (Slovenian Territorial Defence) were recognised as sovereign on their territory.It was agreed that all Yugoslav military units would leave Slovenia, with the Yugoslav government setting a deadline of the end of October to complete the process. The Slovenian government insisted that the withdrawal should proceed on its terms; the JNA was not allowed to take much of its heavy weaponry and equipment, which was later either deployed locally or sold to other Yugoslav republics. The withdrawal began about ten days later and was completed by 26 October.\n\nDue to the short duration and low intensity of the war, casualties were not high. According to Slovenian estimates, the YPA suffered 44 fatalities and 146 wounded, while the Slovenians had 18 killed and 182 wounded. Twelve foreign nationals were killed in the conflict, principally journalists and Bulgarian truck drivers who had strayed into the line of fire. 4,692 YPA soldiers and 252 federal police officers were captured by the Slovenian side. According to post-war assessments made by the YPA, its material losses amounted to 31 tanks, 22 armoured personnel carriers, 6 helicopters, 6,787 infantry weapons, 87 artillery pieces and 124 air defence weapons damaged, destroyed or confiscated. Property damage was not heavy, due to the scattered and short-term nature of the fighting.\n\nThe border station at Holmec was the location of an alleged war crime perpetrated by Slovenian TO forces, filmed by the Austrian public broadcasting station ORF. Video footage shows a small group of YPA soldiers standing or walking slowly with raised hands, holding up a white sheet in an apparent attempt to surrender. Moments later, gunfire is heard and the soldiers fall or jump to the ground. Neither the origin of the gunfire nor its exact effect are clearly visible on the video segment. Slovene officials maintain that the YPA soldiers jumped for cover and were not hit, and that the matter was thoroughly investigated years ago. However, the incident sparked renewed public debate after the footage was shown on Serbian TV station B92 in 2006, with many claiming that the soldiers were shot and killed by Slovenian TO troops and that Slovenia is trying to cover up the affair.\n\nThe fate of the YPA soldiers identified on the footage is disputed. One report claims that the soldiers are still alive, 15 years after the conflict. Other reports identify three young soldiers as victims (Zoran Ješić, Goran Maletić and Antonio Šimunović) and claim that they were killed in the Holmec incident.\n\nThe actions of Slovenia's forces were largely dictated by the military strategy devised some months before and were tightly integrated with an equally detailed media management plan. An international media centre was established prior to the outbreak of conflict with Jelko Kacin designated to act as information minister and Slovenia's public face to the world. The Slovenian government and media successfully presented the conflict to Western European audiences as a case of a \"David versus Goliath\" struggle between an emerging democracy and an authoritarian communist state, and the columns of Yugoslav tanks brought to mind the events of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 two years earlier. This won considerable international sympathy and favourable media coverage for the cause of independent Slovenia.\n\nThe Slovenians had the advantage of superior morale, compared to their adversaries in the Yugoslav army. Many of the Yugoslav soldiers did not realise they were taking part in a real military operation, rather than an exercise, until they came under attack. The officer corps was dominated by Serbs and Montenegrins and in many cases ideologically committed to Yugoslav unity. The rank and file troops however were conscripts, many of whom had no strong motivation in fighting against Slovenes. Of the soldiers of the 5th Military District, which was in action in Slovenia, in 1990 30% were Albanians, 20% Croats, 15 to 20% Serbs and Montenegrins, 10% Bosniaks, and 8% Slovenes.\n\nThe Slovenians were also well aware that the Serbian government of Slobodan Milošević was not particularly concerned about Slovenia's independence, given the lack of any significant Serbian minority in the country. On 30 June, Defence Minister General Kadijević suggested to the Yugoslav federal presidency a massive attack on Slovenia to break down the unexpectedly heavy resistance. But the Serb representative, Borisav Jović, shocked the military establishment by declaring that Serbia did not support further military action against Slovenia. Serbia was at this point more concerned with the situation in Croatia; even before the war had ended, YPA troops were already repositioning themselves for the imminent war in Croatia.\n\nFor Slovenia, the war marked the decisive defence of its independence in regard to Yugoslavia. It was officially recognised by all European Community member states on 15 January 1992 and joined the United Nations on 22 May.\n\nWith Croatia as a buffer between Slovenia and Serbia, Slovenia was able to maintain its independence and position as the most stable and prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics and joined the European Union on 1 May 2004.\n\nThe war led to a series of major shifts on the Yugoslav side. The YPA eventually lost nearly all of its Slovenian and Croat personnel, becoming an almost entirely Serbian and Montenegrin force. Its poor performance in Slovenia and later in Croatia discredited its leadership — Kadijević resigned as defence minister in January 1992, and Adžić was forced into medical retirement shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Slovenian and Croatian governments were urged by the European Commission to freeze their declaration of independence for a period of three months, hoping to ease tension, to which Slovenia and Croatia agreed. Slovenia used the period to consolidate its institutions, deliver some of the most urgent economic reforms and prepare for international recognition of the country.\n\n\n"}

Cream, who poisoned his victims, was executed after his attempts to frame others for his crimes brought him to the attention of London police.\n\nUnsubstantiated rumours suggested his last words as he was being hanged were a confession that he was Jack the Ripper—even though he was supposed to be in prison at the time of the Ripper murders.\n\nBorn in Glasgow, Cream was raised outside Quebec City, after his family moved there in 1854. He attended McGill University in Montreal and graduated with an MDCM degree in 1876 (his thesis topic was chloroform). He then went for post-graduate training at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London, and in 1878 obtained additional qualifications as a physician and surgeon in Edinburgh. He then returned to Canada to practise in London, Ontario.\n\nIn 1876, Cream married Flora Brooks, whom he had impregnated and almost killed while aborting the baby. Flora died, apparently of consumption, in 1877, a death for which Cream would later be blamed.\n\nIn August 1879, Kate Gardener, a woman with whom he was alleged to have had an affair, was found dead in an alleyway behind Cream's office, pregnant and poisoned by chloroform. Cream claimed that she had been made pregnant by a prominent local businessman, but after being accused of both murder and blackmail, Cream fled to the United States.\n\nCream established a medical practice not far from the red-light district in Chicago, offering illegal abortions to prostitutes. He was investigated in August 1880 after the death of Mary Anne Faulkner, a woman on whom he had allegedly operated, but he escaped prosecution due to lack of evidence.\n\nIn December 1880 another patient, Miss Stack, died after treatment by Cream, and he subsequently attempted to blackmail a pharmacist who had filled the actual prescription.\n\nIn April 1881, a woman named Alice Montgomery died of strychnine poisoning following an abortion in a rooming house barely a block from Cream's office. The case was ruled a murder but never solved. The location, time period, and method make Cream a likely suspect.\n\nOn 14 July 1881, Daniel Stott died of strychnine poisoning at his home in Boone County, Illinois, after Cream supplied him with an alleged remedy for epilepsy. The death was attributed to natural causes, but Cream wrote to the coroner blaming the pharmacist for the death after again attempting blackmail. Cream was arrested, along with Mrs. Julia A. (Abbey) Stott, who had become Cream's mistress and procured poison from Cream to do away with her husband. She turned state's evidence to avoid jail, laying the blame on Cream, which left him to face a murder conviction on his own. He was sentenced to life imprisonment in Joliet Prison.\n\nOne night unknown persons erected a tombstone at Mr. Stott's grave which read, \nDaniel Stott Died June 12, 1881 Aged 61 Years, poisoned by his wife and Dr. Cream.\nCream was released in July 1891. Governor Joseph W. Fifer had commuted his sentence after Cream's brother pleaded for leniency and allegedly bribed the authorities.\n\nUsing money inherited from his father, who had died in 1887, Cream sailed for England, arriving in Liverpool on 1 October 1891. He returned to London and took lodgings at 103 Lambeth Palace Road. At the time, Lambeth was ridden with poverty, petty crime, and prostitution.\n\nOn 13 October 1891, Ellen \"Nellie\" Donworth, a 19-year-old prostitute, accepted a drink from Cream. She was severely ill the next day and died on 16 October from strychnine poisoning. During her inquest Cream wrote to the coroner offering to name the murderer in return for a £300,000 reward. He also wrote to W. F. D. Smith, owner of the W H Smith bookstalls, accusing him of the murder and demanding money for his silence.\n\nOn 20 October, Cream met with a 27-year-old prostitute named Matilda Clover. She became ill and died the next morning; her death was at first attributed to her alcoholism. Cream wrote a note to the prominent physician Dr. William Broadbent accusing him of poisoning Matilda Clover and demanding cash. Broadbent sent his letter to Scotland Yard.\n\nOn 2 April 1892, after a vacation in Canada, Cream was back in London where he attempted to poison Lou Harvey (née Louise Harris) who, being suspicious of him, pretended to swallow the pills he had given her. She secretly disposed of them by throwing them off a bridge into the River Thames.\n\nOn 11 April, Cream met two prostitutes, Alice Marsh, 21, and Emma Shrivell, 18, and talked his way into their flat where he offered them bottles of Guinness. Cream left before the strychnine he had added to the drinks took effect. Both women died in agony.\n\nThrough his accusatory letters, Cream succeeded in drawing significant attention to himself. Not only did the police quickly determine the innocence of those accused, but they realised there was something significant within the accusations made by the anonymous letter-writer: he had referred to the \"murder\" of Matilda Clover. In fact, Clover's death had been registered under natural causes, related to her drinking. The police quickly realised that the false accuser who had written the letter was the serial killer now referred to in the newspapers as the 'Lambeth Poisoner'.\n\nNot long afterward, Cream met a policeman from New York City who was visiting London. The policeman had heard of the Lambeth Poisoner, and Cream gave him a brief tour of where the various victims had lived. The American happened to mention it to a British policeman who found Cream's detailed knowledge of the case suspicious.\n\nThe police at Scotland Yard put Cream under surveillance and soon discovered his habit of visiting prostitutes. They also contacted police in the United States and learned of their suspect's conviction for a murder by poison in 1881.\n\nAt the inquest held by Athelstan Braxton Hicks in July 1892 he read out a letter purporting to be from Jack the Ripper declaring Dr Neill innocent, which produced laughter including from Neill. The jury returned the verdict that Matilda Clover died from strychnine poisoning administered by Thomas Neill.\n\nOn 3 June 1892, Cream was arrested for the murder of Matilda Clover, and on 13 July he was formally charged with the murders of Clover, Donworth, Marsh, and Shrivell, the attempted murder of Harvey, and extortion. From the start he insisted he was only Dr. Thomas Neill, not Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, and the newspapers usually referred to him as Dr. Neill in their coverage of the proceedings.\n\nHis trial lasted from 17 to 21 October that year. After a deliberation lasting only 12 minutes, the jury found him guilty of all counts, and Justice Henry Hawkins sentenced him to death.\n\nLess than a month after his conviction, on 15 November, Cream was hanged on the gallows at Newgate Prison by James Billington. As was customary with all executed criminals, his body was buried the same day in an unmarked grave within the prison walls.\n\nHis name does not appear in later McGill graduate directories.\n\nBillington claimed that Cream's last words on the scaffold were \"I am Jack The...\" Billington promoted this alleged incident as proof that he was responsible for executing the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper.\n\nThese claims remain unsubstantiated, as police officials and others who attended the execution made no mention of any such event. Moreover, records show Cream was in prison at the time of the Ripper murders in 1888, so it would have been impossible for him to be the culprit. However, Donald Bell suggested that Cream could have bribed officials and left the prison before his official release, and Sir Edward Marshall-Hall suspected that his prison term may have been served by a look-alike in his place. Such notions are unlikely and contradict evidence given by the Illinois authorities, newspapers of the time, Cream's solicitors, Cream's family, and Cream himself.\n\nOne of Cream's biographers suggested that Cream, on the scaffold and about to be hanged, was so frightened that he lost control of his bodily functions and stammered \"I am ejaculating\", which could have been mistaken for \"I am Jack\".\n\nEnglish-Canadian writer Chris Scott won an Arthur Ellis Award for Best Crime Novel in 1989 for \"Jack\", a novel based on the premise that Cream actually was Jack the Ripper.\n\nThe motivation for the series of poisonings has never been settled. It has generally been assumed that Cream was a sadist who enjoyed the thought of the agonies of his victims (even if he was not physically present to witness these). However, Cream was also interested in money, as evidenced by his attempts at extortion in almost all of his crimes, so it remains a possibility that he committed the murders under the pretense of ill-planned attempts to profit from them. From the start of the series of crimes Cream wrote blackmail notes to prominent people; and the poisoning of his one known male victim, Daniel Stott, was committed with the hope that Stott's wealthy widow would share the deceased's estate with Cream.\n\nIn addition to the five poisonings Cream was convicted for, he is suspected in the murder of his wife Flora Brooks in 1877, and at least four other women who died in his care while undergoing abortions.\n\nIn the 2015 BBC One television series \"River\", Cream appears frequently to and converses with D.I. John River as a \"manifest\".\n\nIn the first episode (in 2000) of \"Murder Rooms: Mysteries of the Real Sherlock Holmes,\" the young Conan Doyle and Dr Bell pursue a murder case that involves a Thomas Neill, played by the actor Alec Newman. At the end, a postscript further identifies him as Dr. Thomas Neill Cream, who attended medical school alongside the real Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\n"}

{"id": "3656142", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3656142", "title": "Water Festival", "text": "Water Festival\n\nThe Water Festival is the New Year's celebrations that take place in East Asian countries such as China and Taiwan, and Southeast Asian nations such as Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand. It is called the <nowiki>'Water Festival'</nowiki> by Westerners because they notice people splashing or pouring water at one another as part of the cleansing ritual to welcome the New Year. Traditionally people gently sprinkled water on one another as a sign of respect, but as the new year falls during the hottest month in South East Asia, many people end up dousing strangers and passersby in vehicles in boisterous celebration. The act of pouring water is also a show of blessings and good wishes. It is believed that on this Water Festival, everything old must be thrown away, or it will bring the owner bad luck.\nThe annual Water Splashing Festival of the Dai ethnic minority falls during the New Year celebrations of the Dai Calendar. It is the most important festival observed by the Dai ethnic people of Xishuangbanna Prefecture, and, similar to its direct neighbor Laos' Songkran festival, it involves three days of celebrations that include sincere, yet light-hearted religious rituals that invariably end in merrymaking, where everyone ends up getting splashed, sprayed or doused with water.\n\nThe festival lasts for three days. The first two days's activities are concentrated on the banks of the Lancang (Mekong) River. On the first day, a grand celebration marks the beginning of the festival. An out-door market is set up, where locals go for new year shopping. It is also a great place to purchase local souvenirs. Local food and snacks are other highlights traveler may not want to miss. Artists create sand carvings on open space close to the market. A dragon boat race is held on the Lancang River to ring out the old year in the afternoon. At night, the banks of the river are colorfully lit, and locals float river lanterns on the river. Floating river lanterns is an old tradition in China, which is still preserved in many cities today. The practice is thought to drive bad luck away and bring good luck.\n\nThe third day, the climax of the festival, is reserved for water splashing. On that day, the Dai put on their newest and best clothes, then assemble at the local Buddhist temple, where the monks chant Buddhist scriptures. Afterward, a symbolic water splashing ritual is enacted whereby a Buddhist statue, with pomp and ceremony, is first coaxed out of the temple to the courtyard, then is splashed with water. This important ritual is called 'Bathing the Buddha'.\n\nThe completion of the 'Bathing the Buddha' ritual serves as the signal that encourages ordinary mortals to themselves engage in mutual water splashing. Accordingly, people flock to the streets with pots, pans, bottles, or whatever, where they uninhibitedly splash, spray and douse each other with water, with the same gusto with which Westerners engage in a good snowball free-for-all.\n\nThe Water Splashing ceremony, however, is more than just good-natured fun; it also contains a religious element: water is regarded by the Dai as a symbol, firstly, of religious purity, but also of goodwill among people. Therefore, splashing a fellow human being with water during the Water Splashing Festival, whether a close neighbor or a fellow villager, or even a stranger, is an expression of the desire for good luck and prosperity to that person.\n\nIn Yunnan (China), the Water Splashing Festival is celebrated by the Dai ethnic group which is one of the 55 ethnic minorities in China. The whole celebration usually starts on the 13th of April and takes 3–7 days. On the first day of the festival Dai people race dragon boats and light fireworks (made of bamboo) for good luck in the coming years. The second day, Dai people get together to dance, and pour water on others because they believe that pouring water on others can help remove bad luck and bring out happiness. Finally, on the last day of the festival, young generations will get together to exchange gifts and date their mates. The Water Splashing Festival is one of the most influential ethnic festivals in Yunnan area. It attracts thousands of tourists every year from all over China. The huge tourist industry contributes greatly to the development of the area.\n\nThe festival has many different names specific to each country, such as Songkran in Laos and Thailand, Chaul Chnam Khmer or Songkran in Cambodia, and Thingyan in Myanmar. The New Year is celebrated in other South Asian countries, based on the astrological event of the sun beginning its northward journey. Traditional dance, singing and cultural shows are performed together during the festival. Religious activities in the tradition of Theravada Buddhism are also carried out at both pagoda and monastery. Young people visit elders to pay respect during this period.\n\nThe Myanmar New Year \"Thingyan\" is announced by the traditional calendar of Myanmar Team and normally falls around 13 April. Cambodia celebrates the Cambodian New Year from 13 to 15 April (ចូលឆ្នាំខ្មែរ or សង្ក្រាន្ត). The Lao New Year, called Songkran (ສົງກຣານ) in the Lao language, is celebrated every year from 13 to 15 April. The Thai New Year (สงกรานต์ = Songkran in Thai language) is fixed every year from 13 to 15 April.\n\n\"Water Festival\" is often a confusing term for foreigners in Cambodia because the Khmer New Year in April is not normally referred to as \"the Water Festival\", unlike equivalent new year celebrations in neighboring countries. Rather, the \"Water Festival\" in Cambodia usually refers to the festival Bon Om Thook (Khmer:ពិធីបុណ្យអុំទូក) focused on traditional boat racing, which usually takes place in November each year.\n\nThe water festival in Cambodia is in November. It is related to Boat Racing water Festival.\nNew Year which is on April is not called a water festival.\n"}
