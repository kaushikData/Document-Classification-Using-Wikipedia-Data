{"id": "23550312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23550312", "title": "Accounting scandals", "text": "Accounting scandals\n\nAccounting scandals are business scandals which arise from intentional manipulation of financial statements with the disclosure of financial misdeeds by trusted executives of corporations or governments. Such misdeeds typically involve complex methods for misusing or misdirecting funds, overstating revenues, understating expenses, overstating the value of corporate assets or underreporting the existence of liabilities. It involves an employee, account or corporation itself and is misleading to investor and shareholders.\n\nThis type of \"creative accounting\" can amount to fraud, and investigations are typically launched by government oversight agencies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States. Employees who commit accounting fraud at the request of their employers are subject to personal criminal prosecution.\n\nMisappropriation of assets, often called defalcation or employee fraud, occurs when an employee steals company's asset, whether those assets are of monetary or physical nature. Typically, assets stolen are cash or cash equivalents and company data or intellectual property. However, misappropriation of assets also includes taking inventory out of a facility or using company assets for personal purpose without authorization. Company assets include everything from office supplies, inventory to intellectual property.\n\nFraudulent financial reporting, also known as earnings management fraud. In this context, management intentionally manipulates accounting policies or accounting estimates to improve financial statements. Public and private corporations commit fraudulent financial reporting to secure investor interest or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet expectations of shareholders. The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought enforcement actions against corporations for many types of fraudulent financial reporting, including improper revenue recognition, period-end stuffing, fraudulent post-closing entries, improper asset valuations, and misleading non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nThe fraud triangle is a model for explaining the factors that cause someone to commit fraudulent behaviors in accounting. It consists of three components, which together, lead to fraudulent behavior:\nIncentives/ Pressures: A common incentive for companies to manipulate financial statement is a decline in the company's financial prospects. Companies may also manipulate earnings to meet analysts' forecasts or benchmarks such as prior year earnings, to meet debt covenant restrictions, to achieve a bonus target based on earnings, or to artificially inflate stock prices. As for misappropriation of assets, financial pressures are a common incentive for employees. Employees with excessive financial obligations, or those with drug abuse or gambling problems may steal to meet their personal needs.\n\nOpportunities: Although the financial statements of all companies are potentially subject to manipulation, the risk is greater for companies in industries where significant judgments and accounting estimates are involved. Turnover in accounting personnel or other deficiencies in accounting and information processes can create an opportunity for misstatement. As for misappropriation of assets, opportunities are greater in companies with accessible cash or with inventory or other valuable assets, especially if the assets are small or easily removed. A lack of controls over payments to vendors or payroll systems, can allow employees to create fictitious vendors or employees and bill the company for services or time.\n\nAttitudes/ Rationalization: The attitude of top management toward financial reporting is a critical risk factor in assessing the likelihood of fraudulent financial statements. If the CEO or other top managers display a significant disregard for the financial reporting process, such as consistently issuing overly optimistic forecasts, or they are overly concerned about the meeting analysts' earnings forecast, fraudulent financial reporting is more likely. Similarly, for misappropriation of assets, if management cheats customers through overcharging for goods or engaging in high-pressure sales tactics, employees may feel that it is acceptable for them to behave in the same fashion.\n\nA weak internal control is an opportunity for a fraudster. Fraud is not an accounting problem; it is a social phenomenon. If you strip economic crime of its multitudinous variations, there are but three ways a victim can be unlawfully separated from money: by force, stealth or trickery. Lack of transparency in financial transactions is an ideal method to hide a fraud. Poor management information where a company's management system does not produce results that are timely, accurate, sufficiently detailed and relevant. In such case, the warning signal of fraud such as ongoing theft from bank account can be obscured. Lack of an independent audit department within the company is also a sign of weak internal control. Poor accounting practice is also part of a weak internal control. An example of poor accounting practice is failure to make monthly reconciliation of bank account.\n\nA top executive can reduce the price of his/her company's stock easily due to information asymmetry. The executive can accelerate accounting of expected expenses, delay accounting of expected revenue, engage in off balance sheet transactions to make the company's profitability appear temporarily poorer, or simply promote and report severely conservative (e.g. pessimistic) estimates of future earnings. Such seemingly adverse earnings news will be likely to (at least temporarily) reduce share price. (This is again due to information asymmetries since it is more common for top executives to do everything they can to window dress their company's earnings forecasts.\n\nTop managers tend to share price to make a company an easier takeover target. When the company gets bought out (or taken private) – at a dramatically lower price – the takeover artist gains a windfall from the former top executive's actions to surreptitiously reduce share price. This can represent tens of billions of dollars (questionably) transferred from previous shareholders to the takeover artist. The former top executive is then rewarded with a golden handshake for presiding over the firesale that can sometimes be in the hundreds of millions of dollars for one or two years of work.\n\nSimilar issues occur when a publicly held asset or non-profit organization undergoes privatization. Top executives often reap tremendous monetary benefits when a government-owned or non-profit entity is sold to private hands. Just as in the example above, they can facilitate this process by making the entity appear to be in financial crisis – this reduces the sale price (to the profit of the purchaser), and makes non-profits and governments more likely to sell. It can also contribute to a public perception that private entities are more efficiently run, thereby reinforcing the political will to sell off public assets. Again, due to asymmetric information, policy makers and the general public see a government-owned firm that was a financial 'disaster' – miraculously turned around by the private sector (and typically resold) within a few years. Under the Special Plea in Fraud statute, “the government must ‘establish by clear and convincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were false, and that it intended to defraud the government by submitting those claims.’” Mere negligence, inconsistency, or discrepancies are not actionable under the Special Plea in Fraud statute.\n\nNot all accounting scandals are caused by top executives. The proceedings can take so long to come to trial that one executive saw the charges against him dismissed. Often managers and employees are pressured or willingly alter financial statements for the personal benefit of the individuals over the company. Managerial opportunism plays a large role in these scandals. For example, managers who would be compensated more for short-term results would report inaccurate information, since short-term benefits outweigh the long-term ones such as pension obligations.\n\nThe Enron scandal turned in the indictment and criminal conviction of one of the Big Five auditor Arthur Andersen on June 15, 2002. Although the conviction was overturned on May 31, 2005, by the Supreme Court of the United States, the firm ceased performing audits and is currently unwinding its business operations. The Enron scandal was defined as being one of the biggest audit failures. The scandal included utilizing loopholes that were found within the GAAP (General Accepted Accounting Principles). For auditing a big sized company such as Enron, the auditors were criticized for having brief meetings a few times a year that covered large amounts of material. By January 17, 2002, Enron decided to discontinue its business with Arthur Andersen claiming they had failed in accounting advice and related documents. Arthur Andersen was judged guilty of obstruction of justice for getting rid of many emails and documents that were related to auditing Enron. Since the SEC is not allowed to accept audits from convicted felons, the firm was forced to give up its CPA licenses later in 2002, costing over 113,000 employees their jobs. Although later the ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, the once-proud firm's image was tarnished beyond repair, and it has not returned as a viable business even on a limited scale.\n\nOn July 9, 2002 George W. Bush gave a speech about recent accounting scandals that had been uncovered. In spite of its stern tone, the speech did not focus on establishing new policy, but instead focused on actually enforcing current laws, which include holding CEOs and directors personally responsible for accountancy fraud.\n\nIn July 2002, WorldCom filed for bankruptcy protection, in what was considered the largest corporate insolvency ever at the time.\n\nThese scandals reignited the debate over the relative merits of US GAAP, which takes a \"rules-based\" approach to accounting, versus International Accounting Standards and UK GAAP, which takes a \"principles-based\" approach. The Financial Accounting Standards Board announced that it intends to introduce more principles-based standards. More radical means of accounting reform have been proposed, but so far have very little support. The debate itself, however, overlooks the difficulties of classifying any system of knowledge, including accounting, as rules-based or principles-based. This also led to the establishment of Sarbanes-Oxley.\n\nOn a lighter note, the 2002 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics went to the CEOs of those companies involved in the corporate accounting scandals of that year for \"adapting the mathematical concept of imaginary numbers for use in the business world\".\n\nIn 2003, Nortel made a big contribution to this list of scandals by incorrectly reporting a one cent per share earnings directly after their massive layoff period. They used this money to pay the top 43 managers of the company. The SEC and the Ontario securities commission eventually settled civil action with Nortel. However, a separate civil action will be taken up against top Nortel executives including former CEO Frank A. Dunn, Douglas C. Beatty, Michael J. Gollogly and MaryAnne E. Pahapill and Hamilton. These proceedings have been postponed pending criminal proceedings in Canada, which opened in Toronto on January 12, 2012. Crown lawyers at this fraud trial of three former Nortel Networks executives say the men defrauded the shareholders of Nortel of more than $5 million. According to the prosecutor this was accomplished by engineering a financial loss in 2002, and a profit in 2003 thereby triggering Return to Profit bonuses of $70 million for top executives.\n\nIn 2005, after a scandal on insurance and mutual funds the year before, AIG was investigated for accounting fraud. The company already lost over 45 billion US dollars' worth of market capitalisation because of the scandal. Investigations also discovered over a billion US dollars' worth of errors in accounting transactions. The New York Attorney General's investigation led to a $1.6 billion fine for AIG and criminal charges for some of its executives. CEO Maurice R. \"Hank\" Greenberg was forced to step down and is still fighting civil charges being pursued by New York state.\n\nWell before Bernard Madoff's massive Ponzi scheme came to light, observers doubted whether his listed accounting firm—an unknown two-person firm in a rural area north of New York City—was competent to service a multimillion-dollar operation, especially since it had only one active accountant, David G. Friehling. Indeed, Friehling's practice was so small that for years, he operated out of his house; he only moved into an office when Madoff customers wanted to know more about who was auditing his accounts. Ultimately, Friehling admitted to simply rubber-stamping at least 18 years' worth of Madoff's filings with the SEC. He also revealed that he continued to audit Madoff even though he had invested a substantial amount of money with him. Accountants aren't allowed to audit broker-dealers with whom they're investing. He agreed to forfeit $3.18 million in accounting fees and withdrawals from his account with Madoff. His involvement makes the Madoff scheme the largest accounting fraud in world history.\n\n\n"}

This occurred at the Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield during the FA Cup Semi-Final in which 96 spectators were killed and 450 injured in a human crush. The disaster was broadcast live on television and radio. Despite considerable public controversy, South Yorkshire Police had admitted liability in negligence for the deaths, having allowed too many supporters into the stadium.\n\nIn the \"Alcock\" case, 10 relatives of the deceased brought negligence claims in Tort for psychiatric harm or nervous shock. Of the claimants, most had not been present in the stadium at the time of the disaster and none had been in physical risk. Most had sustained psychiatric injuries after learning of the events by television or radio.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case were mostly secondary victims, i.e. they were not \"directly affected\" as opposed to the primary victims who were either injured or were in danger of immediate injury. The Judicial Committee of the House of Lords, consisting of Lord Keith of Kinkel, Lord Ackner, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton, Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle, and Lord Lowry has established a number of \"control mechanisms\" or conditions that had to be fulfilled in order for a duty of care to be found in such cases.\n\n\nThe impact of this on the area of law once described as a '\"patchwork quilt of distinctions which are quite difficult to justify\" is significant because the decision made by the Law Lords was heavily influenced by the greater social concern of allowing a flood of claims with which the judicial system would not be able to cope (the \"floodgates argument\"). The decision has been criticised as being excessively harsh on the claimants, as well as not fully corresponding with medical knowledge regarding psychiatric illness brought about by nervous shock. Although reform has been widely advocated and a legislative proposal to mitigate some of the effects of \"Alcock\" was drafted by the Parliamentary Law Commission in 1998, the decision in \"Alcock\" represents the state of the law in the area of liability for psychiatric harm as it currently stands.\n\n"}

The extended family of al-Baluchi is ethnically Baluchi and originally from Balochistan. The family patriarch and his brother were lay Deobandi preachers. They moved the family to Kuwait in the 1960s.\n\nBaluchi grew up in Kuwait but spent most of teenage years in Iranian Baluchistan, but is a citizen of Pakistan. Trained as a computer technician, he dressed in Western clothes and \"introduced himself as a businessman\", but had been \"groomed ... since boyhood\" by his cousins and uncles \"to join their clandestine war,\" according to journalist Debra Scroggins. According to a U.S. government biography, his \"chief mentor\" was his cousin and 1993 World Trade Center bombing orchestrator Ramzi Yousef, \"who taught him in the early 1990s in Iran about the important of war against the West.\"\n\nHe is fluent in English and worked at Mohammed's honey-processing company in Karachi for a while before being hired in 1998 as a computer technician for \"Modern Electronics Corporation\" in Dubai. According to some evidence given at the Combatant Status Review Tribunal, he was \"very open-minded and western-oriented\", while his ex-wife told investigators he was \"a very strict Muslim\" who opposed his wife's leaving the home.\n\nAccording to a U.S. government biography, Balouchi \"volunteered his services\" to uncle KSM in 1997.\n\nAccording to U.S. officials, the majority of money that came to the Saudi hijackers for the September 11 attacks was transferred through Baluchi and Mustafa al-Hawsawi.\nThe 9/11 Commission reported that he \"helped them with plane tickets, traveler's checks, and hotel reservations\", and \"taught them about everyday aspects of life in the West, such as purchasing clothes and ordering food\". In his defence, Baluchi claims that he often helped people in Dubai with such things to supplement his income, and he had no way of knowing whether any of them were criminals.\n\nOn October 10, 1998, Baluchi used his passport to open a bank account with the Emirates Bank International, using the name \"Ali\" based on his kunya name \"Ibn Abdulaziz Ali\" and listing his employer's address with PO box 16958, Jebel Ali, Dubai.\n\nHe was then introduced to Marwan al-Shehhi by his uncle, and Shehhi allegedly asked him to help transfer money from Shehhi's company in Dubai to his company in the United States, ostensibly to help avoid banking fees if he transferred the money himself.\n\nIn January 2000, an order using Shehhi's credit card had a Boeing 747-400 flight simulator program, a Boeing 767 flight deck video, and some flight attendant literature and flight manuals shipped to Baluchi's work address. Baluchi then shipped them to his uncle to pass onto Shehhi.\n\nOn April 18, Baluchi sent a wire transfer of $5000 to Adel Rafeea, the administrator of the Islamic Center of San Diego, from the Wall Street Exchange Centre in Dubai, using his PO Box, passport and listing his phone number as 0506745651. Rafeaa later claimed that Nawaf al-Hazmi had asked him to accept the money on his behalf.\n\nTracing the calls made to Baluchi's phone number, authorities discovered that he had received 16 calls from June 28–30 from a pre-paid Voicestream cellphone purchased in Manhattan on June 4. The phone was deactivated on July 11, and authorities allege it belonged to Atta, while Baluchi insisted that he only ever spoke with Shehhi, who had hired him. Around this time, Baluchi complained to Mohammed that he couldn't do all this additional work himself, and his uncle told him that Mustafa al-Hawsawi would co-ordinate with him to act as an assistant.\n\nOn June 29, a man named \"Isam Mansur\" wired $5000 to the Western Union at 1440 Broadway in New York, where Shehhi picked it up. This is alleged to have been Baluchi, since two later direct payments into Shehhi's Sun Trust account from the Exchange Center, a $10,000 payment to Shehhi on July 18 from \"Isam Mans\"u\"r\" and a $9500 August 5 payment from \"Isam Mans\"ou\"r\", gave Baluchi's PO Box number.\n\nOn August 8, Baluchi opened a bank account at Dubai Islamic Bank, using his name, passport and phone number. A $20,000 payment from Baluchi's bank account to Shehhi's Sun Trust account on August 29 gave a phone number one digit different than the one given by Isam Mansour on August 5.\n\nA $70,000 payment was made to Shehhi's account by \"Hani (Fawaz Trading)\" on September 17 from the same exchange centre. Hani gave a telephone number one digit removed from the one Baluchi used on the transfer from his bank account on August 29.\n\nIn September, Hani Hanjour went to Dubai, where Baluchi gave him $3000 to open a new bank account, and later deposited $5000 in the account which Hanjour later accessed from ATMs in the United States. When Ahmed al-Ghamdi went to Dubai, Baluchi helped him purchase a cell phone. It is believed nine of the hijackers met with him in Dubai and received various levels of aid.\n\nThe 9/11 Commission Report stated that he \"relied on the unremarkable nature of his transactions, which were essentially invisible amid the billions of dollars flowing daily across the globe.\"\n\nOn August 27, 2001, Baluchi applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a week after his employer announced the closing of their Dubai branch, and the government had sent notices informing the employees their work permits had been rescinded and they had to leave the country. He was declined since he appeared to be an economic immigrant, and instead moved back home to Pakistan a few days before the attacks.\n\nMoving back in with his parents in Karachi, Pakistan, Baluchi saw his uncle several times when he came to visit. According to a short biography written by the United States government's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), after the Taliban was initially driven from power after the 9/11 attack, al-Balouchi assisted KSM in organizing the movement of al-Qaeda operatives and their families to safehouses in Pakistan. \nHe later told investigators he helped his uncle arrange travel visas for people, but didn't know whether any of them were militants or not. In August 2002, the FBI questioned Abdul Samad Din Mohammed, the brother-in-law of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. He reported that Baluchi was often in the company of his uncle, and would pick people up from the airport. His uncle KSM was arrested in Rawalpindi on March 1, 2003. Baluchi spent the next two months with Walid bin 'Attash. According to US reports, following his uncle's arrest Baluchi took charge of some of the new attacks being planned. \n\nBaluchi also married Aafia Siddiqui. She was accused of being an al-Qaeda member and in February 2010 was convicted of assaulting with a deadly weapon and attempting to kill U.S. soldiers and FBI agents who were seeking to interrogate her while she was in custody, claimed to be married to Baluchi. The marriage was confirmed by Pakistani and US intelligence, a defense psychologist, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's family. (Siddiqui's family denies she was married to Baluchi.)\n\nAccording to the FBI, after her arrest, Aafia Siddiqui told them that after she learned she was wanted by the US government she had gone into hiding around late March 2003 with the al-Baluchi clan. Divorced at the time, she stated she married Baluchi out of religious piety, since she \"could not live in the same house with an unmarried male\" (namely Baluchi) she married him. Their marriage was held in Hub Chowki outside of Karachi in the inner courtyard of Balouchi's house, with female al-Baluchi family members present. Siddiqui describes Balouchi as very kind to her, \"a good man who is wrongly accused\". (Siddiqui later repudiated all statements given to the FBI.)\n\nThe marriage lasted only a couple of months. According to one of KSM's uncles—Mohammed Hussein—Baluchi became alienated with Aafia's \"liberal way of life\". Aafia told the FBI that Baluchi divorced her after he was arrested.\n\nSiddiqui was arrested April 29 in Karachi along with al-Attash.\n\nAfter his arrest al-Baluchi was kept in CIA custody at undisclosed locations until September 6, 2006 when he was transferred to Guantanamo Bay Prison in Cuba. In December 2005, Human Rights Watch listed him as a \"ghost detainee\" held in the CIA prison system. During al-Baluchi's secret detention, he was tortured by the CIA using many so-called \"enhanced interrogation techniques\". Officials reported: \"al-Baluchi was tortured and forcibly dunked into a tub filled with ice water. CIA interrogators forcibly kept his head under water while he struggled to breathe and beat him repeatedly with a truncheon-like object hitting him and smashing his head against a wall.\"\n\nBaluchi had a copy of a letter to Osama bin Laden from Saudi scholars in his pocket, a computer disk containing a draft of a letter to bin Laden, two images of the September 11 attacks, and a perfume bottle containing low-concentration cyanide used to bleach and perfume clothes. Baluchi was also accused of discussing the possibility of exporting explosives to the United States through textile companies, but claims to have no knowledge of what conversation is being referenced. The arrests led to the arrests of Jawad al-Bashar and Farzand Shah.\n\nOn November 7, 2003, a detainee was interrogated and said that Mohamed Atta and Ramzi bin al-Shibh spoke briefly in August 2000 about a \"Losh\" who had asked Atta if he could travel to the United States to help with any potential plots, having already asked Mohammed three months earlier. Authorities allege this is a reference to Baluchi.\nAccording to US investigators, Baluchi told them that al-Qaeda had set up a biological weapons lab and he asked Aafia Siddiqui (who has a biology degree from MIT) advice on how long it would take to develop such weapons and whether the man in charge was capable of developing the weapons. Siddiqui replied that she \"was willing to participate in a biological weapons (BW) project if al-Qaida tasked her to do so\".\n\nAnother plot involving Bauchi alleged by US investigators involved Heathrow airport. According to Balochi's file, he told interrogators that he became aware of a plan to attack Heathrow airport in January 2003 and had intended to seek help from a more senior al-Qaida operative, Walid bin Attash, to carry it out.\n\nAn \"analyst note\" in the files notes that the plot called for \"crashing numerous airplanes into Heathrow, with a secondary explosion immediately outside of the airport as a diversion\". It collapsed after KSM was arrested in March 2003.\n\nOn September 6, 2006, Baluchi was transferred from a black site location to Guantanamo Bay detention camp. He was given the Internment Serial Number 10018 and is currently detained at a top-secret site at the Guantanamo base that allegedly houses approximately 15 \"high-value\" prisoners. Its location and the conditions inside are withheld from public knowledge and there are suspected grave human rights concerns regarding its conditions. Al-Baluchi's attorney James G. Connell, III visited him there in August 2013 under an order issued by the military commission.\n\nUS District Court Justice Joyce Hens Green ruled that the Combatant Status Review Tribunals were unconstitutional. Nevertheless, the Department of Defense scheduled Tribunals for the 14 high-value captives who were transferred from covert CIA custody, on September 6, 2006, for early winter of 2007.\n\nThe Summary of Evidence memo for Baluchi's Combatant Status Review Tribunal was drafted on February 8, 2007.\n\nBaluchi cooperated with his tribunal. Although he was not able to call Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Saifullah Paracha or Ramzi bin al-Shibh to testify about his lack of connection to al-Qaeda, he was permitted to have his legal representative field statements they had made. He chose to put forward the statements by Mohammed and bin al-Shibh as evidence, but not the statement by Paracha.\n\nBaluchi requested statements be garnered from \"Modern Electronics Corporation\" personnel, including Samir Sharin, Mohammed Mayer, Asraf Mayer, Ammar al-Tesqui and Sayed Tesqui that would testify he had no connections to militant forces, and that his employee records would show that he left several days before the attacks because his work permit had expired when MEC closed its Dubai branch. The tribunal judge ruled that although Baluchi's leaving Dubai a few days prior to the attacks was among the reasons for his capture, it was not relevant to seek records from his employer. Since the tribunal did not locate the individuals, Baluchi submit two statements he had written himself as what he believed his co-workers would say, and what he believed his Israeli roommates would say.\n\nIn his defence, Baluchi argued that he often acted as a \"businessman\" to supplement his income, and thus his signature, telephone number and similar details were easily obtained in Dubai. He admitted dealing with Marwan al-Shehhi, but said that \"when [he] approached me, he never declared himself as 'hijacker Marwan al Shehhi'. He approached me the same way he approached other individuals and companies in the U.S. — a man wanting to do business\".\n\nIn February 2008, Baluchi was committed to a joint trial, charged with conspiracy, attacking civilians and civilian objects, causing serious bodily injury, murder, destruction of property, hijacking, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism.\n\nAl Baluchi, Walid Bin Attash, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed chose to serve as their own attorney.\nThey requested laptops, and internet access, in order to prepare their defenses. In October 2008 Ralph Kohlmann ruled that the men be provided with the computers, but not the internet access.\nAl Baluchi's request said he was a Microsoft Certified software engineer.\n\nOn December 8, 2008, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed told the judge that he and the other four indictees wished to plead guilty; however, the plea would be delayed until after mental competency hearings for Hawsawi and bin al-Shibh. Mohammed said, \"We want everyone to plead together.\"\n\nOn January 22, 2009, United States President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13492, ordering a halt to the Guantanamo military commission as part of the overall closure of Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp. On April 21, 2009, United States Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell cited \"Ali Abd al-Azeez Ali\" as an example of the kind of captive United States President Barack Obama might free in the United States when he closes the camp in January 2010, because he didn't know what else to do with him.\n\nIn October 2011, in an operation called the \"baseline review,\" the prison seized all legal materials belonging to \"high-value detainees,\" starting with Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. The prison also announced that it would change its previous policy and begin reviewing legal mail for its content. In response, the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) ordered the attorneys under his supervision to stop sending privileged communications to Guantanamo prisoners. Under the Chief Defense Counsel (United States) policy, Al-Baluchi could not receive mail from his attorneys until November 2013.\n\nOn April 4, 2012, the Department of Defense referred Guantanamo military commission charges against al Baluchi and four other men for participation in the conspiracy leading up to the September 11 attacks. On May 5, 2012, Military Judge James Pohl arraigned al Baluchi, and appointed attorneys to represent him.\n\nA fictionalized account of al-Baluchi's interrogation at black sites is depicted in the 2012 film \"Zero Dark Thirty\". The character \"Ammar\" is portrayed by Reda Kateb. Al-Baluchi has complained that the United States has provided more information to the filmmakers Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal about al-Baluchi's treatment in CIA custody than it has to Baluchi's own attorneys.\n\nThe CIA acknowledged that the character \"Ammar\" is based on al-Baluchi. In the film, \"Dan\" the interrogator and other characters repeatedly describe \"Ammar\" as Mr. Mohammad's nephew. \"Dan\" also references the arrest of \"Ammar\" and describes his role as the financial facilitator in the 9/11 attacks. \"The first 25 minutes of the movie are largely taken up with torture: Ammar is strung up, beaten, water boarded and kept awake for 96 hours straight.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "4536219", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4536219", "title": "Auto Assembly", "text": "Auto Assembly\n\nFounded in 2000 (though was in development since 1994 under the name Ia-Con) by Sven Harvey, Auto Assembly was a Transformers convention held in Birmingham, UK and run by the science-fiction fan organisation Infinite Frontiers. The first event was held in October 2000 and was held annually (except in 2002 and 2007 when it took \"gap years\") until the final event in 2015. The event was very originally called \"The Auto-Assembly\", and came to be referred to colloquially as \"AA.\"\n\nSven Harvey stepped down from his role with the event between the 2008 and 2009 conventions due to various issues unrelated to the event but has now returned to the team. Head of Infinite Frontiers Simon Plumbe is now the owner of the convention working with a team of volunteers.\n\nThe convention started life as a small-scale event, intended to be an occasional Transformers equivalent of the meetings held by the Star Trek fan club Alpha Quadrant (which itself grew from the Delta Quadrant '96 convention run by Infinite Frontiers, headed by Simon Plumbe with Sven being on the committee.) The first event was expected to have a relatively small number of fans attending - smaller than the Star Trek meetings - although this figure was exceeded. Sven's original idea was to grow the meetings over time and then launch the Ia-con convention as an annual event based on the meetings, which originally were to be quarterly. \"The Auto-Assembly\" ran on 22 October 2000 and was run by Sven with Simon in a support administrative role. From the first meeting however, the event grew rapidly and by the time the event reached 2003, \"The Auto-Assembly\" name, as was, was so strong a brand that Ia-con would have been a confusing move. Auto Assembly 2003, only the third event, had expanded to a full-scale convention, though at that point it was referred to as a Transformers Collectors Fair. The growth of the event and the friendliness of the fans in attendance actually converted Simon into a Transformers fan in the process.\n\nThe convention attracts fans from all over the UK and Europe and as far afield as America and Australia and currently holds the European attendance record with 1064 fans attending Auto Assembly 2015 from the UK and Europe.\n\nThe convention has a range of activities, including dealers tables, guest talks, autograph sessions, toy and art displays, video screenings, competitions, charity auctions, workshops (added for 2009) and more. Auto Assembly 2009 featured the convention's first live band as part of its programme - former boy band turned rock band, Next of Kin. In association with sponsors every year, the convention also gives all of its attendees a \"goodie bag\" with complimentary gifts which have included a range of varied items, including postcards, comics, magazines, stickers, PlayStation 2 discs, posters, and even snacks.\n\nRegular guests at the convention have included Transformers comic writer Simon Furman, artists Andrew Wildman, Lee Sullivan, Geoff Senior, Simon Williams, and colourist Jason Cardy. Past voice actor guests have included Wally Wingert (Sideburn and Mirage from \"\") and Neil Kaplan (Optimus Prime and Ro-Tor, \"Transformers: Robots In Disguise\"), David Kaye (Megatron from \"Beast Wars\", \"Beast Machines\", \"\", \"\", \"\" and Optimus Prime in \"\"), \"\" actor Dan Gilvezan in 2008 (Bumblebee) and for 2009 Beast Wars actor Ian James Corlett and G1 actor Gregg Berger.\n\nAuto Assembly: Target 2006, the 2006 convention inspired by the Marvel UK comic story of the same name, had the Auto Assembly debut appearances of artists Guido Guidi and Mike Collins, and the first UK appearance by its guest of honour voice actor David Kaye along with its regular comic guests.\n\nIn March 2006, the convention expanded its activities further with the launch of the Auto Assembly Podcast which featured the normally expected chat and news updates, but also included interviews, competitions and - in a departure from other Transformers podcasts - music. The podcast was hosted by Simon Plumbe and Sven Harvey, who at the time ran the event.\n\nAuto Assembly 2008 was notable by having its first display from Hasbro featuring the unveiling of handmade resin versions of \"Transformers: Animated\" Optimus Prime, Megatron and Bulkhead being given away through a prize draw from an online competition. It also saw the world debut of the trailer for the Transformers: Animated game for the Nintendo DS from Activision. The convention also attracted a great deal of media attention and was attended by a television camera crew from Central News who filmed for a news broadcast, a radio broadcaster from BBC Radio WM attended, and a live interview with Sven Harvey for BBC Radio 5 Live took place early in the day.\n\nIn November 2011, the first Auto Assembly Europe convention, the first Auto Assembly convention outside the UK, was held in Uppsala, Sweden, from 12 to 13 November. It was organised as a joint operation between the Auto Assembly organisers and the Nordic TransFans Association.\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Auto Assembly 2015 would be the final Auto Assembly event due to conflicts with the health and personal lives of the team members at the time. Auto Assembly itself is continuing with other activities including the publication of its fanzine The Cybertronian Times.\n\nEach year the convention produces a full colour fanzine, The Cybertronian Times, which features articles, artwork, fiction and reviews covering all eras of Transformers. In previous years, this fanzine has featured contributions from Simon Furman, Lee Sullivan and Simon Williams. Additional convention exclusives have been produced, including postcards from 2003 onwards and pin badges for 2005 and 2006.\n\nTwelve Auto Assembly events have been held to-date, relocating as new venues have been needed to accommodate the growing attendance figures. Attendance figures are listed in brackets after the venue.\n\nThe convention has been joined by a number of guests over the years. To date, the following have attended or are scheduled to attend:\n\nNotes\n\nThe Auto Assembly Forum is run by convention committee head Simon Plumbe, with the help of the moderators. The forum is not as busy as many of the larger Transformers forums, but is still a vibrant fan community. It was founded on 19 August 2003 following Auto Assembly 2003 to act as a support forum for the conventions, but it quickly developed into a thriving community all of its own. The forum was closed in the Summer of 2011 due to dwindling usage and was relaunched in September of the same year on a new server to coincide of the relaunch and redesign of the conventions website.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3581762", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3581762", "title": "Bahram Chobin", "text": "Bahram Chobin\n\nBahrām Chōbīn (Middle Persian: ; ), also known by his epithet Mihrevandak (\"servant of Mihr (Mithra)\", was a famous \"spahbed\" (senior army commander) during late sixth-century Iran. He usurped the Sasanian throne from Khosrow II, ruling for a year as Bahram VI (590-591). However, he was later defeated by Khosrow II and was forced to flee.\n\nBahram Chobin was son of Bahram Gushnasp, of the House of Mihran, one of the seven Parthian clans of the Sasanian Empire. Bahram Chobin had three siblings whom were named: Gordiya, Gorduya and Mardansina.\n\nBahram Chobin originally started his career as \"marzban\" of Rey, but in 572 he commanded a cavalry force which captured a Byzantine fortress and was promoted to army chief (\"spahbed\") of Adurbadagan and Media. After being promoted he fought a long, indecisive campaign against the Byzantines in northern Mesopotamia.\n\nIn late 588, the massive army of the Göktürks invaded the eastern provinces of the Sasanian Empire, reaching as far as Badghis and Herat. Bahram Chobin was elected as the \"spahbed\" of Khorasan and commander-in-chief to lead 12,000 Sasanian forces against the Turks. After reaching Central Asia his army ambushed a large army of Turks and conquered Balkh. He then crossed the Amu Darya and trapped and defeated the Turks near Bukhara, killing the Göktürk Bagha Qaghan with an arrow.\n\nAfter his great victory against the Turks he was sent to Caucasus to repel an invasion of nomads, possibly the Khazars. Bahram was once again victorious. Bahram Chobin was then made commander of the Sasanian forces against the Byzantines once again, and successfully defeated a Byzantine force in Georgia. However, he later suffered a minor defeat by a Byzantine army on the banks of the Aras. Hormizd IV, who was jealous of Bahram Chobin, used this defeat as an excuse to dismiss Bahram Chobin from his office, and had him humiliated.\n\nBahram, infuriated by Hormizd's actions, responded by rebelling, and due to his noble status and great military knowledge, was joined by his soldiers and many others. He then appointed a new governor for Khorasan, and afterwards set for Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire. Meanwhile, Hormizd tried to come to terms with his brothers-in-law Vistahm and Vinduyih, \"who equally hated Hormozd\". Hormizd shortly had Vinduyih imprisoned, while Vistahm managed to flee from the court. After a short period of time, a palace coup under the two brothers occurred in Ctesiphon, which resulted in the blinding of Hormizd and the accession of the latter's son Khosrow II (who was their nephew through his mother's side). The two brothers shortly had Hormizd killed. Nevertheless, Bahram continued his march to Ctesiphon. \n\nKhosrow then took a carrot and stick attitude, and wrote the following to Bahram: \"Khosrow, kings of kings, ruler over the ruling, lord of the peoples, prince of peace, salvation of men, among gods the good and eternally living man, among men the most esteemed god, the highly illustrious, the victor, the one who rises with the sun and who lends the night his eyesight, the one famed through his ancestors, the king who hates, the benefactor who engaged the Sasanians and saved the Iranians their kingship—to Bahram, the general of the Iranians, our friend... We have also taken over the royal throne in a lawful manner and have no upset Iranian customs... We have so firmly decided not to take off the diadem that we even expected to rule over other worlds, if this were possible... If you wish your welfare, think about what is to be done.\"\n\nBahram, however, ignored his warning—a few days later, he reached the Nahrawan Canal near Ctesiphon, where he fought Khosrow's men, who were heavily outnumbered, but managed to hold Bahram's men back in several clashes. However, Khosrow's men eventually began losing their morale, and were in the end defeated by Bahram Chobin's forces. Khosrow, together with his two uncles, his wives, and a retinue of 30 nobles, thereafter fled to Byzantine territory, while Ctesiphon fell to Bahram Chobin.\n\nVinduyih was sent with a large army granted by Byzantine emperor Maurice. They went to Armenia to outflank Bahram, who was defeated in the lowlands and lost Ctesiphon. He retreated to Azerbaijan and then wrote a letter to Mushegh II Mamikonian, an Armenian \"spahbed\" who was helping Khosrow II, the letter said: \"As for you Armenians who demonstrate an unseasonable loyalty, did not the house of Sasan destroy your land and sovereignty? Why otherwise did your fathers rebel and extricate themselves from their service, fighting up until today for your country?\" Bahram Chobin in his letter promised that the Armenians would become partners of the new Iranian empire ruled by a Parthian dynastic family if he accepted his proposal to betray Khosrow II. Musel, however, rejected the offer.\n\nKhosrow II's army then marched towards Azerbaijan and defeated Bahram Chobin at the Battle of Blarathon, forcing him to flee to the eastern parts of Persia. While Bahram Chobin was fleeing to the east he defeated the army of the House of Karen of Hyrcania and later arrived in Fergana where he was received honorably by the khagan of the Göktürks. Khosrow II, however, could not feel secure as long as Bahram Chobin lived, and succeeded in having him assassinated. The remainder of Bahram's troops returned to northern Iran and joined the rebellion of Vistahm which took place in 590/1–596 or 594/5–600.\n\nAfter Bahram's death, his sister Gordiya traveled to Khorasan, where she married Vistahm, who during that time was also rebelling against Khosrow II.\n\nBahram had three sons named Shapur, Mihran Bahram-i Chobin, and Noshrad. Shapur continued to oppose the Sasanians and later joined the rebellion of Vistahm. After the end of the rebellion, Shapur was executed. Mihran is mentioned in 633 as a general in the Sasanian army and fought against the Arabs during the Muslim conquest of Persia.\n\nThere are many fables attributed to Bahram VI, as is the norm for many heroes in Persian literature. The chapters in Volume VIII of Ferdowsi's 11th-century \"Shahnameh\" on the reigns of \"Hormizd, Son of Khosrow I,\" and \"Khosrow Parviz,\" both of which are almost as much about Bahram Chobin as about Hormizd or his son.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Sasanian Empire, the Samanid dynasty formed of descendants of Bahram Chobin, became one of the first independent Iranian dynasties.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33574257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33574257", "title": "Ballinasloe Horse Fair", "text": "Ballinasloe Horse Fair\n\nThe Ballinasloe Horse Fair is a horse fair which is held annually at Ballinasloe, the second largest town in County Galway, in the western part of Ireland. It is believed to be Europe's oldest and largest Horse Fair, dating back to the 18th century. This annual event attracts up to 100,000 visitors from all over the world, with many returning to the town year after year. This festival is one of the most important social and economic events in the life of the town. The town is also renowned for horse and pony riding, show jumping and other equestrian activities which take place throughout the year.\n\nThe fair lasts nine days and starts on the Saturday before the first Tuesday in October, when a parade through the town is held. It continues during the next week and includes a beauty contest (the Queen of the Fair), tug-of-war competitions, dog shows, artistic and cultural events, singing competitions and fairground attractions as well as the titular horse fair. The latter event includes sale-and-purchase, racing and show-jumping and these are concentrated on a 6-acre site on Society Street - the fair green. Events culminate during the second week-end; the Saturday of which is known as \"Country Fair Day\". Traditionally, this was the day in the fair with the highest attendance from local rural residents.\n\nThe fair is known by a variety of names, including the \"Ballinasloe October Fair\", the \"October Fair\" and the \"Great Horse Fair\" and it is the oldest horse fair in Ireland. It is now predominantly known as a horse fair, but previously served the range of agricultural interests associated East Galway and South Roscommon, the hinterland of Ballinasloe. Traditionally, farmers from the eastern portions of Ireland travelled to Ballinasloe to purchase livestock from western counterparts.\n\nBallinasloe historically served as a meeting point, or hosting area, for clansmen from local tribes. Indeed its name derives from \"Béal Átha na Sluaıghe\", the Irish for \"Ford-mouth of the Hostings\". Evidence on the date of the fair's origin is scant but the town's traditional role as a meeting place justifies local traditional belief that this is an ancient event. \nBy the late 18th century, the fair was being reported in \"The Times\" as involving the sale of \"65,758 sheep, and 6,565 bullocks\" while in the early 19th century the paper reported it as \"the largest of its kind in Europe\" (1804) and \"the greatest in the British empire\" (1816). The rumor has it that the Fair became even more famous after Napoleon allegedly bought a horse there and rode it during the Battle of Austerlitz (1805).\nA local land-owing family, the le Poer Trenches, who received the Earldom of Clancarty, shaped much of the 18th and 19th century history of the town. They exercised control over the fair owing to their ownership of the land around the town, coming known as the \"Baron of the Fair\". They sponsored the housing of the Farming Society of Ireland in Ballinasloe and in 1840 the Ballinasloe District Agricultural Society was formed. An Agricultural Hall was opened on \"Farming Society Street\" now renamed \"Society Street\".\n\nIn 1948 a committee was formed that organised a carnival to coincide with the Fair and the Show. Thanks to the efforts of this committee and those of the long-established Show Society, the Ballinasloe October Fair has prospered.\n\nThe Ballinasloe Fair has a long traditional association with the Irish Travelling Community who regularly congregate there. Ballinasloe ranks with the Appleby Horse Fair, in Appleby-in-Westmorland in importance for this community. Horses used to be central to the Travellers itinerant lifestyle and many of the nomads still keep and breed them. However, older Travellers point out that some traditions are dying out.\n\nThe 2011 fair ran during the period of campaigning for the presidential election and the fair became a stop off on the campaign trail.\n"}
{"id": "50689054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50689054", "title": "Biens mal acquis", "text": "Biens mal acquis\n\nBiens mal acquis () is a phrase used in French courts for litigation seeking the repayment of assets stolen from poor countries by corrupt officials. The phrase refers to anti-corruption legal proceedings against former dictators and strongmen outside of their country, the seizure of assets within the country of the legal proceedings, and the return of the assets to their country they were embezzled from. \"Biens mal acquis\" is primarily used in France for its former colonies in the Françafrique, but has since been used for similar cases filed in Spain, Switzerland and Monaco, and also against the Marcos family and the estate of Sani Abacha.\n\nThe phrase \"biens mal acquis\" is derived from the French proverb \"\" meaning \"a thing dishonorably obtained never truly enriches\" in English, and is generally translated to the equivalent English phrase of \"ill-gotten goods\". In a March 2007 report by the Catholic Committee Against Hunger and for Development (CCFD), titled \"Biens mal acquis... profitent trop souvent. La fortune des dictateurs et les complaisances occidentales\" (English: Ill-Gotten Goods... Too Often Do Benefit: Western Complacency and the Wealth of Dictators), enumerates known instances of kleptocracy in African dictatorships, estimating that $100–180 billion in assets have been diverted by national leaders through embezzlement or unnecessary expenditure in recent decades. For example, Mobutu Sese Seko, the President of Zaïre from 1965 until his death in 1997, became notorious for using his position as military dictator to openly embezzle massive sums of state money to fund an extravagant lifestyle. Mobutu had homes in France and Switzerland, and by the time of his death held a personal fortune of $5–6 billion, leaving his country with a public debt of $13 billion.\n\n\"Biens mal acquis\" was originally used in France for anti-corruption legal proceedings filed in its own judicial system against heads of state of the Françafrique accused of misappropriating or stealing state assets for their own benefit. The phrase became associated with corrupt politicians of these poor post-colonial countries, as they and their associates often invested their illegally-acquired fortunes in France. The term was later popularized for all litigation filed against any corrupt politicians of poor countries in any foreign judicial system, normally in Western Europe, where the assets stolen by the defendant are believed to be held. Seized assets from former dictators found to have misappropriated treasury funds while in power have since been returned in restitution to the governments of the countries they were stolen from. Despite being the first G8 country to ratify the United Nations Convention against Corruption, known as the Mérida Convention, France has not undertaken any restitution measures. In other cases, judicial proceedings are still underway, or opposition groups have asked for the money to be returned in some other way to the country's people because a corrupt government is still in power. Sometimes this takes the form of a development project, with negotiated milestones for the release of funds.\n\nThe Belgian Centre national de coopération au développement (CNCD), or National Center for Cooperation in Development, has defined \"biens mal acquis\" as a \"fixed or liquid asset or fund which may be misappropriated and illegally removed from the public heritage, and thereby impoverishing the state\". Ill-gotten goods may result from tortious or criminal activity, which has enabled heads of state to enrich themselves far beyond the level their official incomes can explain. Ill-gotten goods may stem from embezzlement, theft, or the illicit transfer of money from state to personal accounts, from corruption or from kickbacks. Their owners often use opaque methods to hide their capital, assured of impunity, particularly due to tax havens, and also assured of the complacency of developed nations.\n\nThis section is a list of known assets successfully seized through \"biens mal acquis\" rulings and is incomplete:\n\nGabonese president Ali Bongo Ondimba is estimated to have paid €98 million to the family for the Soyecourt, an historic hôtel particulier on the rue de l'Université in the 7th arrondissement in central Paris.\nGabon - Assets seized from the family of Omar Bongo\n\nRepublic of the Congo - Assets seized from the family of Denis Sassou Nguesso\n\nEquatorial Guinea - Assets seized from the family of Teodoro Obiang\nThis sections is a known list of restitutions made by \"biens mal acquis\" rulings and is incomplete:\n\nSwitzerland has made several restitutions:\n\nThe United Kingdom has also returned to Nigeria funds that Sani Abacha had sheltered in Jersey in the Channel Islands.\n\nFollowing the Iraq War in 2003, the United States and its allies seized more than $2 billion from the family of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, the single largest restitution to date, which was slated to be used to rebuild Iraq..\n\nIn May 2009, the Spanish anti-corruption prosecutor requested a money-laundering investigation of the accounts and investments in Spain of the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang, following a complaint filed in December 2008 by the Asociacion pro derechos humanos de España (APDHE). The association was concerned by a transfer of roughly €19 million between 2000 and 2003 from the US bank Riggs Bank to an account in a Spanish bank in the Balearic Islands.\n\nLaws put into effect after the liberation of France in the Second World War targeted illegitimate profits accrued during German occupation, in the black market or through simple theft. The ordinances of October 18, 1944 and January 6, 1945 drew inspiration from the following principle: \"The most elementary fiscal justice requires that all gains made possible by the presence of the enemy be returned to the public treasury. It is unacceptable that while the nation became impoverished some enriched themselves at its expense.\"\n\nCiting this precedent, in March 2007 Survie, the Sherpa Association and the Fédération des Congolais de la Diaspora filed charges of conspiracy and concealment of diversion of funds in the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris against five heads of African states and their families:\n\nThe three NGO organizations suspected these heads or former heads of state of buying up a surprising number of luxury real estate assets in France, and of holding banking assets in French banks and/or foreign banks doing business in France. An investigation opened in June 2007 was characterized as insufficiently detailed and suspended in November 2007. The French newspaper \"Le Monde\" obtained transcripts for the hearing into whether to pursue the investigation and in January 2008 published a list of dozens of real estate properties owned by family members of Sassou Nguesso and Omar Bongo in Paris and in the south of France, some of them worth millions of euros. Maître William Bourdon of Survie, the plaintiffs' legal representation, denounced the decision to close the case as \"astounding\" (\"ahurissant\") The family of Omar Bongo Ondimba, according to the \"Le Monde\" hearing transcripts, owned 33 apartments or houses including a \"hôtel particulier\" in Paris worth more than €18 million. The \"hôtel particulier\" was purchased in June 2007 by a real estate company associated with two children of the Gabonese president, then aged 13 and 16. The family of Sassou Nguesso owned at least 18 apartments or houses in France. In Gabon, an association christened \"Touche pas à mon président\" (Don't touch my president) was formed in July 2008 to protest the NGOs denouncing the real estate assets of Omar Bongo.\n\nOn December 2, 2008, Transparency International France, the Sherpa Association, and a Gabonese citizen named Grégory Ngbwa Mintsa filed new charges against Omar Bongo, Denis Sassou Nguesso and Teodoro Obiang as well as their entourages, of concealing the embezzlement of public funds.\n\nPatrick Maisonneuve, the lawyer for Omar Bongo, announced the same day that a defamation complaint would be filed based on the allegations of embezzlement, intimidation and corruption, but as of May 2009 no such complaint had been filed. On December 5 Congolese government spokesman Alain Akouala Atipault announced that the Congo had filed a complaint in the Tribunal de grande instance of Paris against Transparency International France and Sherpa. \"I have simply decided that my lawyer in Paris will pursue these gentlemen (TI and Sherpa), who are in reality a few bourgeois in Neuilly who may never even have set foot in the Congo\", declared Sassou Nguesso. On December 31, 2008, Grégory Ngbwa Mintsa, a party to the complaint in France, was questioned and imprisoned for \"possession of a document with intent to distribute it for propaganda purposes\" and \"oral or written propaganda with intent to incite revolt against the authorities,\" with, on January 7, three leaders of a Gabonese NGO and a journalist as a result of a complaint filed by Fondation Omar Bongo. On January 8, , lawyer for the Gabonese, was prevented by the border police at Roissy Airport in Paris from boarding a plane for a flight to Libreville, his four-day visa having been cancelled by the Gabonese authorities \"for security reasons\". The conditional release of the four on January 12 was accompanied by a \"mandat de dépôt\".\n\nJanuary 20, 2009 the Congolese journalist Bruno Ossébi, who had expressed the intention of joining the complaint, was the victim of a fire at his home in Brazzaville where he, his girlfriend and her two children died in the fire. Bruno Ossébi suffered second-degree burns but had been recovering when he died suddenly February 2 in Brazzaville. According to Reporters without Borders, who said it was \"probable\" that the fire was a deliberate attack, Ossḗbi had three days earlier published an article on the online news site Mwinga alleging that the national petroleum corporation, managed by the president's son, had approached a French bank about a $100 million loan secured by its oil production, in contravention of Congo's pledges to the International Monetary Fund. He had made contact with the Stolen Goods Recovery Initiative at the World Bank, just two days earlier. The day after Ossébi's death, a fire also broke out at the Orléans home of Benjamin Toungamani, who in the previous December filed a complaint with French police against unknown persons because of death threats against his family. At the request of the prosecution, the decision in this case, scheduled for the end of February, was pushed back until after the visit of French President Nicolas Sarkozy to the Republic of the Congo at the end of March.\n\nMay 5, 2009, the most senior investigating judge in Paris, Françoise Desset, agreed to hear the case, a decision the prosecutor appealed. On October 29, 2009, the Paris court of appeal upheld the Ministry and found that Transparency International lacked standing. Following the association's appeal the French Court of Cassation, the court of final appeal, on November 9, 2010 found that Transparency International could participate in the suit, henceforth allowing a French examining magistrate to investigate.\n\nA February 2011 alert from Tracfin, the money-laundering unit of the French finance ministry, mentioned a purchase by Obiang's son of €18 million worth of fine art in February 2009 alone. On October 6, 2011, Transparency International France and Sherpa Association announced a new complaint in civil court to circumvent the block by the prosecutor's office, which had been refusing an indictment needed for the examining magistrates to deal with new facts discovered in the course of their investigation. On July 12, 2012, the examining magistrates in charge of the investigation issued an international arrest warrant for Teodorin Nguema Obiang following his refusal to appear. For Maud Perdriel-Vaissière, director of Sherpa, this step demonstrated \"the seriousness of the allegations Sherpa has been making from the first [...] and show that nobody should believe themselves above law. From now on, immunity is no longer a synonym of impunity\".\n\nMarch 19, 2014 the juges d'instruction of the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris indicted Teodorin Nguema Obiang for money-laundering.\n\nOn March 30, 2009, Monaco opened an investigation into accounts in the name of Édith Bongo, who died March 14, 2009. Bongo was suspected of having acted as nominee in several banking establishments for both her husband and father, the presidents of Gabon and Republic of the Congo, respectively, in order to mask assets obtained with diverted funds. The investigation was opened following a letter from the Sherpa Association to Prince Albert II and to the prosecutor of Monaco, requesting an investigation and the freezing of Édith Bongo's financial assets in Monaco.\n\nOn April 30, 2009, Switzerland extended the freezing of 8.3 million Swiss francs in an account in Mobutu Sese Seko,'s name, originally instituted on May 17, 1997. On February 12, 2009, the federal office of the Swiss justice system ordered the restitution to Haiti of 7 million Swiss francs (€4.6 million) frozen in Swiss bank accounts since 1986, to finance development projects. Former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier filed an appeal of this decision on March 19, 2009.\n"}

Held annually on the second Saturday in August, The parade route travels through the Bronzeville and Washington Park neighborhoods on the city's south side. Robert S. Abbott, the founder and publisher of the \"Chicago Defender,\" created the fictional character of Bud Billiken, which he featured in a column in his paper. David Kellum, co-founder of the Bud Billiken Club and longtime parade coordinator suggested the parade as a celebration of African-American life. Since its beginning, the parade has featured celebrities, politicians, businessmen, civic organizations and youth. It is considered the second largest parade in the United States, whose focus is on celebrating youth, education and African-American life. The parade is also cited as the \"back-to-school\" celebration, marking the end of summer vacation and resuming of school for Chicago's youth.\n\nBud Billiken is a fictional character created in 1923 by Abbott, who had been considering adding a youth section to the \"Chicago Defender\" newspaper. While dining at a Chinese restaurant he noticed a Billiken. Some of the early Billiken columns were written by Willard Motley, who later became a prominent novelist. During the early 1930s, names of international youth were listed in the \"Bud Billiken\" section of the newspaper every week. Between 1930–34, approximately 10,000 names appeared and were archived in the Carter G. Woodson Regional Library of the Chicago Public Library.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, Abbott featured the Bud Billiken character in his newspaper as a symbol of pride, happiness and hope for black residents. The character gained prominence in a comic strip and the \"Chicago Defender\" newspaper. Although the character was created in 1923, the parade did not begin until 1929, when David Kellum initiated it as a celebration of the \"unity in diversity for the children of Chicago\". It has since grown to become a locally televised event and the second largest parade in the nation.\n\nThe parade, which began on August 11, 1929, now includes politicians, beauty queens, celebrities, musical performers, and dozens of marching, tumbling and dancing groups. It has grown from a locally sponsored event to one with major corporate presence and is seen as a signal of the impending end of summer and beginning of the new school year. As such the parade sponsors raise money for college scholarships for local youth. The parade route has changed over the years. The original route was along Michigan Avenue beginning at 31st Street, then turned east into Washington Park. Complaints for north-south traffic flow caused rerouting the parade route to South Parkway (now named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive), which runs directly into the park. At various times, street repairs have necessitated use of the Michigan route, but the current route is now the King Drive route. Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll of \"Amos 'n' Andy\" were the first guests in the first parade. Robert S. Abbott led the first parade in his Rolls Royce. Dr. Marjorie Stewart Joyner, president of the Chicago Defender Charities, Inc., organized the parade for over 50 years. Numerous high-profile celebrities and dignitaries have attended the parade over the years, including U.S. President Harry S. Truman, Michael Jordan, Joe Louis, Muhammad Ali, Duke Ellington, Adelaide Hall, Oprah Winfrey, Diana Ross, Lena Horne, Ethel Waters, Cab Calloway, Paul Robeson, Chaka Khan and Billie Holiday. Truman rode alongside John H. Sengstacke, who was Abbott's nephew and took over the \"Chicago Defender\" in 1948, and Mayor Richard J. Daley in the 1956 Parade. Recent parades have featured popular musical acts as concert performers at the post-parade picnic. In 2006, approximately 26 million people saw the parade, including 25 million television viewers and 1.2 million attendees. The 2006 parade included 74,000 participants and 160 floats and vehicles. The 2008 parade was dedicated to actor and comedian Bernie Mac (star of \"The Bernie Mac Show\") and a native of Chicago; he died an hour before the start of the parade. In 1993, a request by a black LGBT group to participate in the parade was declined by the organizers. Following legal action and the involvement of Lambda Legal, the Ad Hoc Committee of Proud Black Lesbians and Gays was allowed to participate in the parade the following year.\n\nThe parade has been televised for over 35 years, beginning in 1978 on WGN-TV; which broadcast the parade until 2012. WCIU-TV covered the parade beginning in 2012 after it was canceled from WGN-TV but later canceled it in 2014. WLS-TV has been broadcasting the parade since 1984. The 89th Annual Parade took place on August 11, 2018. BET and Centric premiered the parade on their networks in 2012.\n\nThe Chicago Defender Charities underwent a major restructuring in 2017. Myiti Sengstacke–Rice is Board President of the Chicago Defender Charities and Bud Billiken Parade Chair. Sengstacke–Rice is the great-grandniece of Robert Sengstacke Abbott, granddaughter of John Herman Henry Sengstacke, founder of the Chicago Defender Charities and daughter of the late famed photojournalist, Robert Abbott Sengstacke.\n\nThe parade has categorized contests for participants such as best float, and best marching band. It takes place in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, starting at 35th Street\n\nBud Billiken Parade is themed every year by the parade committee. The tradition began in 1940 when the parade organizers themed the parade \"Americanism\" to demonstrate patriotism in the US within the African-American community. Other themes over the years:\nA notable person or persons are invited each year to serve as Grand Marshal, often featuring politicians, musicians, or entertainers. Chicago native Chance the Rapper served as the Grand Marshal for the 88th annual parade in 2017. Chicago native and singer Chaka Khan served as the Grand Marshal at the 2014 parade. Rapper T.I. served as Grand Marshal for the 83rd annual parade in 2012.\n\nAt the 78th annual parade in 2007, then–U.S. Senator Barack Obama served as the Grand Marshal for the second year in a row. Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley attended, and march participants included U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, Lieutenant Governor of Illinois Pat Quinn and the Rev. Al Sharpton. One float represented the Chicago 2016 Committee and included past Chicago Olympians Bob Pickens, Willie May, Diane Simpson-Bundy and Kenny Johnson as well as the son of Danell Nicholson. The Chicago Bulls' mascot made a guest appearance.\n\nThe parade begins at 10 A.M. After the parade, visitors are welcomed to stay in Washington Park for the \"after-parade-activities\". The \"after-parade-activities\" has various festivities and vendor booths. The post–parade festivities often include a concert. The 2006 parade featured Yung Joc, and the 2007 parade featured Pretty Ricky. However, it seems neither \"after-parade-activities\" included a concert.\n\nThe 2003 parade featured B2K. The concert was free with virtually unlimited space in the park for viewing. However, the crowd became unruly causing the concert to be curtailed. Over 40 attendees were taken to hospitals as a result of injuries in the violence, including two teenagers who were shot.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "170717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=170717", "title": "Burglary", "text": "Burglary\n\nBurglary, also called breaking and entering and sometimes housebreaking, is an unlawful entry into a building or other location for the purposes of committing an offence. Usually that offence is theft, but most jurisdictions include others within the ambit of burglary. To engage in the act of burglary is to \"burgle\" in British English, a term back-formed from the word \"burglar\", or to \"burglarize\" in American English.\n\nAt common law, burglary was defined by Sir Matthew Hale as:\n\n\nThe common-law elements of burglary often vary between jurisdictions. The common-law definition has been expanded in most jurisdictions, such that the building need not be a dwelling or even a building in the conventional sense, physical breaking is not necessary, the entry does not need to occur at night, and the intent may be to commit any felony or theft.\n\nThe etymology originates from Anglo-Saxon or Old English, one of the Germanic languages. According to one textbook, \"The word \"burglar\" comes from the two German words , meaning \"house\", and , meaning \"thief\" (literally \"house thief\"). Another suggested etymology is from the later Latin word , \"to break open\" or \"to commit burglary\", from , meaning \"fortress\" or \"castle\", with the word then passing through French and Middle English, with influence from the Latin , \"thief\". The British verb \"burgle\" is a late back-formation.\n\nIn Canada, breaking and entering is prohibited by section 348 of the Criminal Code and is a hybrid offence. Breaking and entering is defined as trespassing with intent to commit an indictable offence. The crime is commonly referred to in Canada as \"break and enter\", which in turn is often shortened to \"B and E\".\n\nThere is no crime of burglary as such in Finland. In the case of breaking and entering, the Finnish penal code states that A person who unlawfully\n(1) enters domestic premises by force, stealth or deception, or hides or stays in\nsuch premises [...] shall be sentenced for invasion of domestic premises to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months.\n\nHowever, if theft is committed during unlawful entering, then a person is guilty of theft or aggravated theft depending on the circumstances of the felony.\nAggravated theft:\n(1) If in the theft\nand the theft is aggravated also when assessed as a whole, the offender shall be\nsentenced for aggravated theft to imprisonment for at least four months and at most\nfour years.\n\nIn Sweden, burglary does not exist as an offence in itself; instead, there are two available offences. If a person simply breaks into any premise, they are technically guilty of either unlawful intrusion () or breach of domiciliary peace (), depending on the premise in question. Breach of domiciliary peace is applicable only when a person \"unlawfully intrudes or remains where another has his living quarters\". The only punishments available for any of these offences are fines, unless the offences are considered gross. In such cases, the maximum punishment is two years' imprisonment.\n\nHowever, if the person who has forced themself into a house steals anything (\"takes what belongs to another with intent to acquire it\"), they are guilty of (ordinary) theft (). However, the section regarding gross theft (Chapter 6, 4s of the Penal Code, ) states \"in assessing whether the crime is gross, special consideration shall be given to whether the unlawful appropriation took place after intrusion into a dwelling.\" For theft, the punishment is imprisonment of at most two years, while gross theft carries a punishment of between six months and six years.\n\nBurglary is defined by section 9 of the Theft Act 1968, which describes two variants:\n\nThe offence is defined in similar terms to England and Wales by the Theft Act (Northern Ireland) 1969.\n\nUnder Scots law, the crime of burglary does not exist. Instead theft by housebreaking covers theft where the security of the building is overcome. It does not include any other aspect of burglary found in England and Wales. It is a crime usually prosecuted under solemn procedure in a superior court. Another common law crime still used is Hamesuken, which covers forced entry into a building where a serious assault on the occupant takes place. Common law crimes in Scotland are gradually being replaced by statutes.\n\nIn the United States, burglary is prosecuted as a felony or misdemeanor and involves trespassing and theft, entering a building or automobile, or loitering unlawfully with intent to commit any crime, not necessarily a theft--for example, vandalism. Even if nothing is stolen in a burglary, the act is a statutory offense. Buildings can include hangars, sheds, barns, and coops; burglary of boats, aircraft, trucks, and railway cars is possible. Burglary may be an element in crimes involving rape, arson, kidnapping, identity theft, or violation of civil rights; indeed, the \"plumbers\" of the Watergate scandal were technically burglars. As with all legal definitions in the U.S., the foregoing description may not be applicable in every jurisdiction, since there are 50 separate state criminal codes, plus federal and territorial codes in force.\n\nCommission of a burglary with the intention or result of confronting persons on the premises may constitute an aggravated offense known as \"home invasion.\"\n\nIn some states, a burglary committed during the hours of daylight is technically not burglary, but housebreaking. In many jurisdictions in the U.S., burglary is punished more severely than housebreaking. In California, for example, burglary was punished as burglary in the first degree, while housebreaking was punished as burglary in the second degree. California now distinguishes between entry into a residence and into a commercial building, with the burglary of a residence bearing heavier punishment.\n\nIn states that continue to punish burglary more severely than housebreaking twilight, night is traditionally defined as hours between 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise.\n\nSome academics consider burglary an inchoate crime. Others say that because the intrusion itself is harmful, this justifies punishment even when no further crime is committed.\n\nPossession of burglars's tools, in jurisdictions that make this an offense, has also been viewed as an inchoate crime:\nUnder Florida State Statutes, \"burglary\" occurs when a person \"enter[s] a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter.\" Depending on the circumstances of the crime, burglary can be classified as third, second, or first-degree felonies, with maximum sentences of five years, fifteen years, and life, respectively.\n\nA person commits the offense of burglary when, without authority and with the intent to commit a felony or theft therein, he enters or remains within the dwelling house of another or any building, vehicle, railroad car, watercraft, or other such structure designed for use as the dwelling of another or enters or remains within any other building, railroad car, aircraft, or any room or any part thereof. A person convicted of the offense of burglary, for the first such offense, shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years. For the purposes of this Code section, the term \"railroad car\" shall also include trailers on flatcars, containers on flatcars, trailers on railroad property, or containers on railroad property. O.C.G.A. § 16-7-1\n\nBurglary and the intended crime, if carried out, are treated as separate offenses. Burglary is a felony, even when the intended crime is a misdemeanor, and the intent to commit the crime can occur when one \"enters or remains unlawfully\" in the building, expanding the common-law definition. It has three degrees. Third-degree burglary is the broadest, and applies to any building or other premises. Second-degree burglary retains the common-law element of a dwelling, and first-degree burglary requires that the accused be in a dwelling and armed with a weapon or have intent to cause injury. A related offense, criminal trespass, covers unlawful entry to buildings or premises without the intent to commit a crime, and is a misdemeanor or, in the third degree, a violation. Possession of burglar's tools, with the intent to use them to commit burglary or theft, is a misdemeanor.\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses the term \"burglary\" to refer to a night-time breaking and entering of a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony. Burglary is a felony punishable by not more than twenty years; should the burglar enter with a dangerous weapon, they may be imprisoned for life. Unlawful entries of a structure other than a dwelling are labeled \"breaking and entering\" and punishments vary according to structure.\n\nIn Maryland, under title 6, subtitle 2 of the criminal law code, the crime of burglary is divided into four degrees. The first three degrees are felonies, while fourth-degree burglary is a misdemeanor. Breaking and entering into a dwelling with intent to commit theft or a crime of violence is first-degree burglary. Breaking and entering into a \"storehouse\" (a structure other than a dwelling, also including watercraft, aircraft, railroad cars, and vessels) with intent to commit theft, arson, or a crime of violence is second-degree burglary. Third-degree burglary is defined as breaking and entering into a dwelling with intent to commit a crime.\n\nSimple breaking and entering into a dwelling or storehouse without specific intent to commit an additional crime is fourth-degree burglary. This degree also includes two other offenses that do not have breaking and entering as an element: Being in or on the yard, garden, or other property of a storehouse or dwelling with the intent to commit theft, or possession of burglar's tools with the intent to use them in a burglary offense.\n\nIn the criminal code of New Hampshire, \"A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied section thereof, with purpose to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.\"\n\nUnder the New York Penal Law, burglary is always a felony, even in third degree. It is more serious if the perpetrator uses what appears to be a dangerous weapon or enters a dwelling.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, it is a defense to prosecution if the building or structure in question is rendered abandoned.\n\nIn Virginia, there are degrees of burglary, described as \"Common Law Burglary\" and \"Statutory Burglary\".\n\nCommon Law Burglary is defined as: if any person breaks and enters the dwelling of another, in the nighttime, with intent to commit a felony or any larceny (theft < $200) therein, shall be guilty of burglary, punishable as a class 3 felony; provided, however, that if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.\n\nStatutory Burglary is defined as: If any person in the nighttime enters without breaking, or in the daytime breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in a dwelling house or an adjoining, occupied outhouse, or, in the nighttime enters without breaking or at any time breaks and enters or enters and conceals himself in any office, shop, manufactured home, storehouse, warehouse, banking house, church or other house, or any ship, vessel or river craft, or any railroad car, or any automobile, truck, or trailer, if such automobile, truck or trailer is used as a dwelling or place of human habitation, with intent to commit murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of Virginia State code section 18.2-77, 18.2-79, or 18.2-80, shall be deemed guilty of statutory burglary, which offense shall be a class 3 felony. However, if such person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.\n\nAdditionally, if any person commits any of the acts mentioned in the VA state code section 18.2-90 with intent to commit larceny, or any felony other than murder, rape, robbery or arson in violation of VA state code section 18.2-77, 18.2-79, or 18.2-80, or if any person commits any acts mentioned in 18.2-89 or 18.2-90 with intent to commit assault and battery, shall be guilty of statutory burglary, punishable by confinement in a state correctional facility for not less than one or more than twenty years, or, in the discretion of the jury or the court trying the case without a jury, be confined in jail for a period not exceeding twelve months or fined not more than $2,500, either or both. However, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 felony.\n\nFinally, if any person break and enter a dwelling house while said dwelling is occupied, either in the day or nighttime, with intent to commit any misdemeanor except assault and battery or trespass (which falls under the previous paragraph), shall be guilty of a class 6 felony. However, if the person was armed with a deadly weapon at the time of such entry, he shall be guilty of a class 2 felony.\n\nIn Wisconsin, burglary is committed by one who forcibly enters a building without consent and with intent to steal or to commit another felony. Burglary may also be committed by entry to a locked truck, car or trailer or a ship. The crime of burglary is treated as being more serious if the burglar is armed with a dangerous weapon when the burglary is committed or arms himself/herself during the commission of the burglary.\n\nProtection of a household against burglars can include defences from anti-burglar paint through safety and security window film to burglar-proof doors and windows and burglar alarms. A little over half of burglars would bypass a house if they thought it had alarm protection. Dogs of any size can warn residents through loud barking, with larger dogs posing a threat of severe injury to an intruder. The victim may also rightfully use self-defence in many jurisdictions.\n\nIn case of a burglar entering the house, secret stores can help protect against theft. Ordinary places such as boxes, tables, and cabinets are prime targets of the burglar. It's recommended to leave fake money and jewelry in these places, which can help to preserve real valuables.\n\nAfter a crime has been committed, tactics such as cocooning have been shown to dramatically reduce the incidence of repeat offences. Cocooning involves notifying neighbours in the street that a break and enter has occurred, thereby encouraging a form of natural surveillance. Studies show this may decrease the rate of property crime by up to 50% in the local area.\n\nThe UNODC notes \"that when using the figures, any cross-national comparisons should be conducted with caution because of the differences that exist between the legal definitions of offences in countries, or the different methods of offence counting and recording\". Also not every crime is reported and the rate of reported crimes may vary by countries.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2217772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2217772", "title": "Crush syndrome", "text": "Crush syndrome\n\nCrush syndrome (also traumatic rhabdomyolysis or Bywaters' syndrome) is a medical condition characterized by major shock and renal failure after a crushing injury to skeletal muscle. Crush \"injury\" is compression of extremities or other parts of the body that causes muscle swelling and/or neurological disturbances in the affected areas of the body, while crush \"syndrome\" is localized crush injury with systemic manifestations. Cases occur commonly in catastrophes such as earthquakes, to victims that have been trapped under fallen or moving masonry.\n\nVictims of crushing damage present some of the greatest challenges in field medicine, and may be among the few situations where a physician is needed in the field. The most drastic response to crushing under massive objects may be field amputation. Even if it is possible to extricate the patient without amputation, appropriate physiological preparation is mandatory: where permissive hypotension is the standard for prehospital care, fluid loading is the requirement in crush syndrome.\n\nSeigo Minami, a Japanese physician, first reported the crush syndrome in 1923. He studied the pathology of three soldiers who died in World War I from insufficiency of the kidney. The renal changes were due to methemoglobin infarction, resulting from the destruction of muscles, which is also seen in persons who are buried alive. The progressive acute renal failure is because of acute tubular necrosis.\n\nThe syndrome was later described by British physician Eric Bywaters in patients during the 1941 London Blitz. It is a reperfusion injury that appears after the release of the crushing pressure. The mechanism is believed to be the release into the bloodstream of muscle breakdown products—notably myoglobin, potassium and phosphorus—that are the products of rhabdomyolysis (the breakdown of skeletal muscle damaged by ischemic conditions).\n\nThe specific action on the kidneys is not understood completely, but may be due partly to nephrotoxic metabolites of myoglobin.\n\nThe most devastating systemic effects can occur when the crushing pressure is suddenly released, without proper preparation of the patient, causing reperfusion syndrome. In addition to tissue directly suffering the crush mechanism, down stream tissue is subject to ischemia-reperfusion injury of the appendicular musculoskeletal system. Without proper preparation, the patient, with pain control, may be cheerful before extrication, but die shortly thereafter. This sudden decompensation is called the \"smiling death.\"\n\nThese systemic effects are caused by a traumatic rhabdomyolysis. As muscle cells die, they absorb sodium, water and calcium; the rhabdomyolysis releases potassium, myoglobin, phosphate, thromboplastin, creatine and creatine kinase.\n\nCompartment syndrome can be secondary to crush syndrome. Monitor for the classic 5 Ps: pain, pallor, parasthesias, pain with passive movement, and pulselessness.\n\nDue to the risk of crush syndrome, current recommendation to lay first-aiders (in the UK) is to not release victims of crush injury who have been trapped for more than 15 minutes. Treatment consists of not releasing the tourniquet and fluid overloading the patient with added Dextran 4000 iu and slow release of pressure. If pressure is released during first aid then fluid is restricted and an input-output chart for the patient is maintained, and proteins are decreased in the diet.\n\nThe Australian Resuscitation Council recommended in March 2001 that first-aiders in Australia, where safe to do so, release the crushing pressure as soon as possible, avoid using a tourniquet and continually monitor the vital signs of the patient. St John Ambulance Australia First Responders are trained in the same manner.\nAs mentioned, permissive hypotension is unwise. Especially if the crushing weight is on the patient more than 4 hours, but often if it persists more than one hour, careful fluid overload is wise, as well as the administration of intravenous sodium bicarbonate. The San Francisco emergency services protocol calls for a basic adult dose of a 2 L bolus of normal saline followed by 500 ml/h, limited for \"pediatric patients and patients with history of cardiac or renal dysfunction.\" \n\nIf the patient cannot be fluid loaded, this may be an indication for a tourniquet to be applied.\n\nThe clinician must protect the patient against hypotension, renal failure, acidosis, hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. Admission to an intensive care unit, preferably one experienced in trauma medicine, may be appropriate; even well-seeming patients need observation.

{"id": "26412387", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26412387", "title": "Fordicidia", "text": "Fordicidia\n\nIn ancient Roman religion, the Fordicidia was a festival of fertility, held on the Ides of April (April 13), that pertained to farming and animal husbandry. It involved the sacrifice of a pregnant cow to Tellus, the ancient Roman goddess of the Earth, in proximity to the festival of Ceres (Cerealia) on April 19.\n\nOn the Roman religious calendar, the month of April \"(Aprilis)\" was in general preoccupied with deities who were female or ambiguous in gender, opening with the Feast of Venus on the Kalends. Several other festivals pertaining to farm life were held in April: the Parilia, a feast of shepherds, on April 21; the Robigalia on April 25, to protect crops from blight; and the Vinalia, one of the two wine festivals on the calendar, at the end of the month. Of these, the Fordicidia and Robigalia are likely to have been of greatest antiquity. William Warde Fowler, whose early 20th-century work on Roman festivals remains a standard reference, asserted that the Fordicidia was \"beyond doubt one of the oldest sacrificial rites in Roman religion.\"\n\nThe late Republican scholar Varro explains the name of the festival as follows:\n\nThe forms \"horda\" and \"Hordicalia\" are also found. Like many other aspects of Roman law and religion, the institution of the Fordicidia was attributed to Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome. The rustic god Faunus instructed Numa in a dream that a sacrifice to Tellus would mitigate the harsh agricultural conditions Rome was grappling with, but the oracular message required interpretation: \"By the death of cattle, King, Tellus must be placated: two cows, that is. Let a single heifer yield two lives \"(animae)\" for the rites.\" Numa solved the riddle by instituting the sacrifice of a pregnant cow.\n\nAs with other rituals in which public cult was mirrored by private, or \"vice versa\", one sacrifice was conducted on behalf of the state, in this case at the Capitol, and one in each of the thirty \"curiae\", the most ancient divisions of the city made by Romulus from the original three tribes. This was the first of two festivals involving the \"curiae\", the other being the Fornacalia on February 17, which differed in that there was no ritual of state corresponding to the local ceremonies and its moveable date was fixed annually by the \"curio maximus\".\nIn the state sacrifice for the Fordicidia, the unborn calf was wrenched from its mother's womb by the attendants of the \"Virgo Vestalis Maxima\", or Vestal Maxima, and burnt. Its ashes were preserved by the Vestals and used as one of the ingredients in the ritual substance \"suffimen\", along with the dried blood of the October Horse from the previous year, and the stalks from which beans had been harvested. The \"suffimen\" was sprinkled on the bonfires of the Parilia, the festival devoted to purifying shepherds and their sheep, and later celebrated also as the \"birthday\" of the city. The sacrifice at the Fordicidia and preparation of the \"suffimen\" constituted the first public ceremony of the year in which the Vestals played an active role.\n\nThe purpose of the sacrifice, as suggested by the Augustan poet Ovid in his elegiac calendar and by the 6th-century antiquarian John Lydus in his book \"On the Months\", was to assure the fertility of the planted grain already growing in the womb of Mother Earth in the guise of Tellus, to whom the sacrifice was offered. As with certain other rituals over which the Vestals presided, the unborn calf is a liminal or mediating being: not yet born, but living; not a full-fledged victim, but sacrificed. The role of the Vestals emphasizes their importance in linking through the ritual reuse of elements the Earth's fertility, the health and safety of the flocks, and the security of the city, including and especially its military security against invasion.\n\nThe Fordicidia, along with about half the festivals of Republican Rome, does not appear on the calendar of 354, when the empire was becoming Christianized.\n\nIn the spirit of the Cambridge Ritualists and comparative mythologists, Fowler pointed to a Chinese spring festival witnessed in 1804 by the British ambassador to China, John Barrow. At the temple of Earth, a large porcelain cow was carried in procession then shattered to reveal several small cow-images inside. These were distributed among the people as tokens of a good growing season. Fowler speculated that the Chinese rite was in origin an animal sacrifice similar to that of the Fordicidia.\n"}
{"id": "85643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=85643", "title": "Fulton Opera House", "text": "Fulton Opera House\n\nThe Fulton Opera House, also known as the Fulton Theatre or simply The Fulton, is a League of Regional Theatres class B regional theater located in historic downtown Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It is reportedly the oldest working theatre in the United States. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964.\n\nFulton Hall is named after Robert Fulton (1765-1815), Lancaster County's steam engine pioneer, and it is his likeness that is portrayed in the statue on the front facade. This statue is a replica of the original wooden statue, which has since been restored and now resides on display inside the interior lobby. The building itself was built on the foundation of Lancaster's pre-Revolutionary jail. In 1763, a vigilante gang known as the Paxton Boys massacred the Conestoga Indians being held there for their protection. This was a monumental event throughout the colonies and became the subject matter for the first plays ever written on American soil - \"A Dialogue Between Andrew Trueman and Thomas Zealot About the Killing the Indians at Cannestogoe and Lancaster\" and \"The Paxton Boys, a Farce\". The exterior wall of the jail courtyard is now the back wall of the theatre.\nChristopher Hager, a Lancaster merchant and civic leader, commissioned the renowned Philadelphia architect Samuel Sloan (who later designed the Lancaster County Courthouse) to create a building that would serve as a community center for meetings, lectures, concerts, and theatrical performances. The building was erected in 1852.\n\nThe Fulton Theatre was later modified by noted theatrical architect Edwin Forrest Durang, is one of only three theatres recognized as National Historic Landmarks (the others are the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia and the Goldenrod Showboat in St. Louis, Missouri). \nThe 1959 production of \"Our Town\", starring Jeanne Clemson, marked that first time that a live theater production had been performed at the Fulton Opera House in thirty years.\n\nA founding member of the League of Historic American Theatres (LHAT), the Fulton is operated by the Fulton Theatre Company, a non-profit organization.\n\nAs the Fulton is run on a non-profit basis, it depends on a variety of grants, corporate sponsorship, and private donations to accomplish its mission. The Fulton is an Equity House, operating under agreement with the Actor's Equity Association and the Union for Professional Actors and Stage Managers (which essentially means that its actors and production team are paid per collective bargaining agreements, as opposed to non-equity actors who are not paid per collective bargaining agreements or volunteers) and employs members of the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society and the United Scenic Artists. The Fulton is also a member of ASSITEJ, the International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People.\n\nThe Fulton Theatre is home to six mainstage productions per year including previous productions of Disney's \"Newsies\", \"In The Heights\", Agatha Christie's \"The Mousetrap, some of which are world premier originals (critically acclaimed \"Lightning Rod\", 2005); four family series productions, including the Fulton's own 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,\" \"Aladdin\", J\"ack and the Beanstalk, the Musical\", and other theatre for young audiences productions; and four studio series productions, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama \"Disgraced\", along with other riveting productions like \"Venus in Fur\", \"Veronica's Room\" and \"Other Desert Cities\". Although most casting takes place in New York City, regional auditions are also held. While many of The Fulton's regulars are Lancaster County natives who are delighted at the chance to return home to perform, nearly all quickly fall in love with the \"Grand Old Lady\" and her charm.\n\nIn addition to providing a place of employment for professional actors, the Fulton Theatre Company is a complete production facility which employs full-time carpenters, electricians, scenic artists, painters, composers, lighting and sound technicians. Most set pieces and costumes are created in-house or at an adjacent workshop, and makeup, hair, and wigs are created by a full-time designer. The Fulton also maintains a costume shop which provides access to professional quality costumes and props to schools, community theatre companies, and other organizations throughout the region. Its marketing department maintains a website that allows users to browse theatre history, check audition times, and purchase tickets. All posters and print materials, including production programs, are cataloged and archived by the Lancaster Historical Society.\n\nMany famous actors have appeared at the Fulton. In December 1930 Basil Rathbone appeared as Christian St. Obin in \"A Kiss of Importance\". Peter Weir's film, \"Witness,\" starring Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis, much of which represents the lifestyle of the Amish, premiered here in February, 1985.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "263187", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263187", "title": "Gypsy (musical)", "text": "Gypsy (musical)\n\nGypsy is a 1959 musical with music by Jule Styne, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents. \"Gypsy\" is loosely based on the of Gypsy Rose Lee, the famous striptease artist, and focuses on her mother, Rose, whose name has become synonymous with \"the ultimate show business mother.\" It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress June Havoc. \n\nThe musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including \"Everything's Coming up Roses\", \"Together (Wherever We Go)\", \"Small World\", \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\", \"Let Me Entertain You\", \"All I Need Is the Girl\", and \"Rose's Turn\". It is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-20th century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the \"book musical\".\n\n\"Gypsy\" has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them Ben Brantley (\"what may be the greatest of all American musicals...\") and Frank Rich. Rich wrote that \"\"Gypsy\" is nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to \"King Lear\".\" Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that \"\"Gypsy\" is one of the best of musicals...\" and described Rose as \"one of the few truly complex characters in the American musical.\"\n\nA musical based on the memoirs of Gypsy Rose Lee was a project of producer David Merrick and actress Ethel Merman. Merrick had read a chapter of Lee's memoirs in \"Harper's Magazine\" and approached Lee to obtain the rights. Jerome Robbins was interested, and wanted Leland Hayward as co-producer; Merman also wanted Hayward to produce her next show. Merrick and Hayward approached Arthur Laurents to write the book. As he relates, Laurents initially was not interested until he saw that the story was one of parents living their children's lives. Composers Irving Berlin and Cole Porter declined the project. Finally, Robbins asked Stephen Sondheim, who agreed to do it. Sondheim had worked with Robbins and Laurents on the musical \"West Side Story\". However, Merman did not want an unknown composer, and wanted Jule Styne to write the music. Although Sondheim initially refused to write only the lyrics, he was persuaded by Oscar Hammerstein to accept the job.\n\nRose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother, is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. The kiddie act has one song, \"May We Entertain You\", that they sing over and over again, with June always as the centerpiece and Louise often as one of the \"boys\" (\"Baby June and Her Newsboys\"). Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks, such as attempting to borrow money from her father (\"Some People\"). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles (\"Small World\"). The girls grow up, and June, now billed as Dainty June, and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit (\"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\"). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and asks her birthday present, a lamb, just how old she is this year (\"Little Lamb\"). After Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal, he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her (\"You'll Never Get Away From Me\").\n\nNow billed as \"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\", the act finally performs on the Orpheum Circuit (\"Dainty June and Her Farmboys\"). June is soon offered a place at a Performing Arts school after an audition. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business (\"If Momma Was Married\"). A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides in Louise that he has been working on his own act (\"All I Need Is the Girl\"), and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together. Shortly after, June is missing, and in a note, she explains that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, and they will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but then optimistically vows that she will make \"Louise\" a star, proclaiming that \"Everything's Coming up Roses\".\n\nLouise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell \"Madame Rose's Toreadorables\" to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together (\"Together, Wherever We Go\"). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a \"gimmick,\" something that \"makes your strip special\" (\"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\"). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Disgusted at Rose's blind ambition for her daughter, Herbie walks out on Rose forever (\"Small World (Reprise)\"). Although reluctant, Louise wants to please her mother and she goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, \"May We Entertain You?\". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her \"gimmick\" (\"Let Me Entertain You (Gypsy Strip Tease)\").\n\nIn the months that follow Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to \"Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!\" The song becomes brasher and brassier, and more and more articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. After a bitter argument between Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated \"Gypsy Rose Lee,\" Rose realizes Herbie and June are both gone, and now Louise is lost to her as well. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, asks \"Why did I do it? What did it get me?\" (\"Rose's Turn\"). All of Rose's unrequited dreams of her own stardom and her personal demons surface. She fantasizes about her own lit-up runway and cheering audience, but finally admits \"I did it for me.\" After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively step toward reconciliation in the end.\n\n\nDuring the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called \"Nice She Ain't\" (cut because it was given to Jack Klugman one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time), and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\". The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\" was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959. Other cut songs include \"Mother's Day\", a song for Baby June's act, \"Smile, Girls\", which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile in order to make the act look good, \"Who Needs Him?\", which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and \"Three Wishes for Christmas\", a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at Minsky's Burlesque.\n\nIn analyzing the character of Rose, Clive Barnes described her as \"bossy, demanding, horrific\". Rich described Rose as \"a monster\". Critic Walter Kerr commented that though Rose is a monster, she must be liked and understood. Patti LuPone describes Rose: \"She has tunnel vision, she's driven, and she loves her kids... And she is a survivor. I do not see her as a monster at all—she may do monstrous things, but that does not make a monster.\" Sondheim has said of the character: \"The fact that she's monstrous to her daughters and the world is secondary... She's a very American character, a gallant figure and a life force.\" Sondheim also noted, \"Yet the end of \"Gypsy\" is not entirely bleak. Louise comes out a star and forgives her mother. There is hope for her. Rose does confront who she is in 'Rose's Turn.' There is a catharsis. It's not Rodgers and Hammerstein, but you feel maybe the mother and daughter will come to an understanding and maybe triumph over Rose's craziness and Louise's bitterness.\"\n\nBrantley noted that Rose is a \"mythic character\". She is \"[t]raditionally presented as an armored tank on autopilot, which finally crashes only minutes before the final curtain\".\n\nBernadette Peters' take on the character was different: \"Rose was a woman who was traumatized by her own mother leaving her at an early age. I think that longing for acceptance is what fuels all her ambition. In the end, when she confronts herself in 'Rose's Turn', she realizes she has failed her daughter just as her own mother failed her...and that destroys Rose. There is a vulnerability to Rose that makes her human, not just some loud and cartoonish parody of a stage mother.\"\n\nThe original Broadway production opened on May 21, 1959 at The Broadway Theatre, transferred to the Imperial Theatre, and closed on March 25, 1961 after 702 performances and two previews. The show was produced by David Merrick and directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins. Ethel Merman starred as Rose, with Jack Klugman as Herbie and Sandra Church as Louise. Scenic and Lighting design were by Jo Mielziner and costumes were by Raoul Pène Du Bois. The orchestrations, including an overture, were supplied by Sid Ramin and Robert Ginzler.\n\nCritic Frank Rich has referred to Robbins' work as one of the most influential stagings of a musical in American theatrical history. The original production received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, Best Actress in a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical, Best Scenic Design, Best Costume Design and Best Direction of a Musical, but failed to win any.\n\nWhen the show closed in March 1961, two national touring companies toured the US. The first company starred Merman and opened in March 1961 at the Rochester, New York Auditorium, and closed in December 1961 at the American, St. Louis, Missouri. The second national company starred Mitzi Green as Rose, followed by Mary McCarty. A young Bernadette Peters appeared in the ensemble and understudied Dainty June, a role she would play the following year in summer stock, opposite Betty Hutton's Rose. It opened in September 1961 at the Shubert Theatre, Detroit and closed in January 1962 at the Hanna, Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nIn 1973, it was announced that Elaine Stritch would be starring in the first West End production of the show. However, when ticket sales proved to be unsuccessful, producers hired the more familiar Angela Lansbury (according to Craig Zadan, \"The ...producers were not able to raise the required capital on Stritch's name, and the promise of a new production...became ominously distant\"). The West End production opened at the Piccadilly Theatre on May 29, 1973. It was produced by Barry M. Brown and Fritz Holt, in association with Edgar Lansbury (Angela's brother) and directed by the show's author, Arthur Laurents, with choreography reproduced by Robert Tucker. The supporting cast featured Zan Charisse, Barrie Ingham, Debbie Bowen and Bonnie Langford. Lansbury left the London production in December 1973 to tour the show in the USA and was succeeded by Dolores Gray. The production closed on March 2, 1974, after 300 performances.\n\nPrior to opening on Broadway, the Lansbury West End production had a 24-week tour of North America, starting in Toronto, and then travelling to many cities, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, DC and Boston. The production opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 23, 1974 for a planned limited engagement, and closed on January 4, 1975 after 120 performances and four previews. The cast remained mainly the same on Broadway, except that Rex Robbins played Herbie, Maureen Moore (later Bernadette Peters' understudy as Rose in the 2003 revival) played the adult June, and Mary Louise Wilson was Tessie Tura. Angela Lansbury won the 1975 Tony Award.\n\nA second revival had pre-Broadway engagements starting at the Jackie Gleason Theater of the Performing Arts, Miami Beach, Florida, in May 1989, and Tampa in May, then The Muny, St. Louis, in June 1989, moving to the Los Angeles Music Center and Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, California in July 1989, and at the Kennedy Center in August and September 1989, with several other venues prior to Broadway.\n\nThe production opened on Broadway on November 16, 1989, at the St. James Theatre, and then moved to the Marquis Theatre on April 18, 1991 and closed on July 28, 1991 after 476 performances and 23 previews. Laurents returned as director, with Tyne Daly as Rose, Jonathan Hadary as Herbie and Crista Moore as Louise. Linda Lavin (on July 30, 1990) and Jamie Ross replaced Daly and Hadary respectively, with Daly returning to the production at the Marquis Theatre from April 18, 1991 until closing.\n\nThis production won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and Daly won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.\n\nJule Styne, in a 1989 interview in connection with the California tryout, said: \"About six months ago, Bette Midler wanted to buy it (\"Gypsy\") for a movie. We wouldn't sell it. Because they'd only destroy it.\" \"USA Today\" reported that \"Both Liza Minnelli and Bernadette Peters say they would love to play it, but they weren't even approached for this production.\"\n\nA new Broadway revival began previews on March 31, 2003 and opened on May 1, 2003 at the Shubert Theatre. The director was Sam Mendes, with choreography by Jerry Mitchell and costumes and sets by Anthony Ward. Bernadette Peters played the role of Rose. \"The New York Times\" described Peters as \"a surefire box office draw who nonetheless may surprise some \"Gypsy\" aficionados...How will the ladylike Ms. Peters fit into the role of Rose, a part indelibly marked by its brassy, belting originator, Ethel Merman?...'One of the main reasons I wanted to do the piece was to cast someone as Rose that was closer to Rose as she really existed,' Mr. Mendes said. 'She was a tiny woman. And she was a charmer. And so is Bernadette.'\" Laurents had talked to Mendes (\"Roughly five years ago\" according to \"The New York Times\" in 2003) about directing the revival, and Mendes said \"he was surprised by the idea of casting Ms. Peters as Rose\". Laurents notes of his suggestions on this production are in his 2009 book \"Mainly on Directing 'Gypsy', 'West Side Story' and Other Musicals\". In a 2004 interview Laurents said that Peters' portrayal of Rose was \"brilliant, original, totally unlike any of the others\" while criticizing Mendes for the \"physical production\" which Laurents said \"was misconceived and hurt the show more than people realized.\" \"Gypsy\" had begun previews with a virtually bare stage, but by opening night this had been changed to a minimalist set. The cast featured John Dossett as Herbie, Tammy Blanchard as Louise, Kate Reinders as June and David Burtka as Tulsa. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical and Best Actress in a Musical.\n\nIn his review, Ben Brantley in \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"the surprise coup of many a Broadway season...Working against type and expectation under the direction of Sam Mendes, Ms. Peters has created the most complex and compelling portrait of her long career...There have been many illustrious successors to Merman as Rose...Only Ms. Peters, however, can be said to have broken the Merman mold completely.\"\n\n\"Gypsy\" twice set new box office records for the Shubert Theatre. Its gross of $853,476 for the week of June 9–14, 2003 was the highest ever gross for a non-holiday week and the subsequent June 15–21, 2003 box office gross of $874,397 represented the highest gross for a show in Shubert history. However, \"The New York Times\" announced that \"Gypsy\" would close on February 28, 2004, stating: \"\"Gypsy\" sold well for most of 2003. But by early January [2004], with tourists gone and local theatergoers staying inside during a brutal stretch of weather, the production's sales grew increasingly weak. More important, the show's advance sale, the main indicator of a production's staying power, began to shrink rapidly. It stood at less than $2 million yesterday.\" After an increase in the gross, the show's closing was postponed indefinitely, but \"Gypsy\" finally closed on May 30, 2004 after 451 performances and 33 previews. The production is believed to have recouped a little more than half of its $8 million investment.\n\nPatti LuPone first portrayed Rose in \"Gypsy\" at the Chicago Ravinia Festival in August 2006, directed by Lonny Price and accompanied by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It began as a concert production but evolved into a full-fledged production featuring Jerome Robbins' original choreography recreated by Bonnie Walker and even a live lamb. Excitement was generated around LuPone playing the role of Rose and producers were eager to see Price's production, with the hope of moving it to New York. Jack Viertel, the artistic director of New York City Center Encores! saw the production and was so impressed that he contacted Arthur Laurents, requesting that he direct a new fully staged production of the show for a new summer \"Encores!\" program. From July 9 to 29, 2007, the show was presented at New York City Center with LuPone once again. Directed by Arthur Laurents, the production also featured Laura Benanti as Louise, Boyd Gaines as Herbie and Leigh Ann Larkin as June. Nancy Opel, Marilyn Caskey, and Alison Fraser played the strippers Mazeppa, Electra, and Tessie Tura (Lenora Nemetz assumed the role of Mazeppa / Miss Cratchitt for the Broadway transfer.)\n\nLuPone recounted in her memoirs that, when Laurents began directing this production, he based his direction initially on the 1989 revival, \"because, I think that in Arthur's mind, the Tyne Daly \"Gypsy\" had been the last successful production.\" However, the cast \"questioned Arthur relentlessly about...the scenes\", and he \"tossed the old prompt book out and freed\" the actors to explore.\n\nThe \"Encores!\" production was a success, and despite Ben Brantley's somewhat negative review of LuPone's performance in \"The New York Times\", the show transferred to Broadway, where it opened at the St. James Theatre on March 27, 2008. Brantley gave the production a rave review, praising LuPone, Laurents and the rest of the cast, and describing the characterizations in the production:\n\"You see, everyone's starved for attention in \"Gypsy\". That craving, after all, is the motor that keeps showbiz puttering along. And Mr. Laurents makes sure that we sense that hunger in everyone... I was so caught up in the emotional wrestling matches between the characters (and within themselves), that I didn't really think about the songs as songs... There is no separation at all between song and character, which is what happens in those uncommon moments when musicals reach upward to achieve their ideal reasons to be.\"\n\nThis production won numerous awards including the Tony Awards and Drama Desk Awards for LuPone, Gaines and Benanti. The show was originally scheduled to close in March 2009 on LuPone's final performance, but closed on January 11, 2009 due to decreases in ticket sales. Like the 2003 production, this revival also closed at a loss. The production played for 332 performances and 27 previews. On the eve before the final curtain call, LuPone made news when she literally stopped the show in the middle of the song \"Rose's Turn\", to scold a patron for taking illegal photographs during the performance.\n\nPatti LuPone had performed in \"Gypsy\" prior to Broadway. She has stated that when she was thirteen years old, she starred as Louise in a high-school production of the show. LuPone had voiced interest in heading the 2003 Broadway revival but author Arthur Laurents had reportedly banned her from any future work with his involvement, as she had previously walked out on a production of \"Jolson Sings Again\", written by Laurents, in 1995. LuPone and Laurents subsequently reconciled.\n\nFollowing a run at the Chichester Festival Theatre, which won the Critics' Choice Theatre Award for Best Musical in 2014, a West End revival of \"Gypsy\" opened at the Savoy Theatre on April 15, 2015, in a limited run through November 28. Directed by Jonathan Kent with choreography by Stephen Mear and set and costume design by Anthony Ward, the production starred Imelda Staunton as Rose, Peter Davison as Herbie, Lara Pulver as Louise, Gemma Sutton as June, Dan Burton as Tulsa, Anita Louise Combe as Tessie Tura, Louise Gold as Mazzeppa and Julie Legrand as Electra. The London production was nominated for eight Laurence Olivier Awards at the 2016 ceremony, winning four, including Best Actress in a Musical (Staunton) and Best Musical Revival, the most awards won by a single production in that year. It also won Best Musical Production and Best Performance in a Musical (for Staunton) at the UK Theatre Awards in 2015. Staunton also won Best Musical Performance at the Evening Standard Awards in 2015. The production was also filmed and broadcast on BBC Four over the 2015 Christmas/New Year period and was first broadcast on PBS in the United States in 2016.\n\nOther notable productions of \"Gypsy\" include:\n\nThe production opened at the Teatro Astral in Buenos Aires, directed by Víctor García Peralta. Mabel Manzotti starred. The cast included Sandra Guida (as Gypsy), along with Eleonora Wexler and Ambar La Fox.\n\nThe production opened at the Teatro Silvia Pinal in Mexico City, produced and directed by Silvia Pinal (legendary Luis Buñuel's \"Viridiana\" muse). Pinal and her daughter, the rock singer Alejandra Guzmán starred. Guzmán was replaced by Irán Castillo.\n\nBetty Buckley, Deborah Gibson and Lenny Wolpe starred at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey. Laura Bell Bundy played June. It was rumored to be Broadway bound, but this did not materialize.\n\nThe production opened at the Theatre Vanemuine in Tartu, directed by Mare Tommingas. The cast included Silvi Vrait as Mama Rose and the production would enjoy a successful run of performances from 2001 through 2003. \n\nThis production ran in rep at the Shaw Festival, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario starring Nora McLellan as Rose and Julie Martell as Louise. Martell understudied Tammy Blanchard in the 2003 Broadway revival. Also, Kate Hennig, who has appeared on Broadway as Ms. Wilkinson in \"Billy Elliot\", played Ms. Cratchitt as well as understudying and playing Rose at certain scheduled performances.\n\n\"Gypsy\" was presented by Phoenix Entertainment with Kathy Halenda starring as Rose and Missy Dowse as Louise. The production was directed by Sam Viverto and assisted by Aja Kane. Principal casting also included Ruby Lewis as June, Rachel Abrams as Mazeppa, Claire Norden as Baby June, Loriann Freda as Tessie Tura, Nick Hamel as Herbie, and Maria Egler as Electra. The tour ended in May 2008.\n\nThe first Brazilian production opened at Teatro Villa-Lobos, Rio de Janeiro, starring Totia Meirelles as Rose, Renata Ricci as June, and Eduardo Falcão as Herbie. Later the production was transferred to Teatro Alfa, São Paulo.\n\nThe very first production of the musical \"Gypsy\" in Joseph Kajetan Tyl's Theatre in Pilsen was short-lived, no more than 18 performances.\n\nFrom September 9 to 18, Lyric Stage in Irving, Texas produced the musical. The production featured a 39 piece orchestra and full original orchestrations that had not been heard since 1961 when the original production closed. It also featured an acoustic guitar part, which had been removed prior to the Boston tryout due to pit size. The production, directed by Len Pluger and Music Directed by Jay Dias, starred Sue Mathys as Rose, Ashton Smalling as Dainty June (she has previously been Baby June at Ravinia in 2006) and Caitlin Carter as Tessie Tura, with local performers Mary McElree as Louise and Sonny Franks as Herbie.\n\nTovah Feldshuh starred as Rose at the Bristol (PA) Riverside Theatre (BRT) production of \"Gypsy\" which opened on December 8, 2011 following two nights of previews.

Uggams' appearance marks the first African-American woman to portray Rose in an Equity Production.\n\nIn October 2014, Imelda Staunton starred as Rose in a production directed by Jonathan Kent. Lara Pulver performed as Louise, Kevin Whately as Herbie, Louise Gold as Mazeppa, Anita Louise Combe as Tessie Tura and Julie Legrand as Electra. The musical ran to 8 November.\n\n2017 The Cape Playhouse\n\nIn July and August of 2017, The Cape Playhouse presented a celebrated revival of \"Gypsy\" that featured Julia Murney as Rose. The production, directed by Michael Rader, choreographed by Jason Sparks and with music direction by Garrett Taylor, broke box office records and featured Caroline Bowman as Louise, James Lloyd Reynolds as Herbie, Tess Soltau as June, Garett Hawe as Tulsa, Jennifer Cody as Tessie and Ms. Cratchit and Wally Dunn as Pop/Goldstone/Webber. \n\nRosalind Russell, Karl Malden, and Natalie Wood starred in the 1962 Warner Bros. film adaptation of the musical. Russell won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her portrayal of Rose.\n\n\"Gypsy\" was also adapted as 1993 television movie with Bette Midler playing Rose. Cynthia Gibb portrayed Louise and Jennifer Beck portrayed Dainty June. Bette Midler won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV; Michael Rafter won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music Direction. This production was a rare example of a film or TV project in which some of the songs are sung live, and not lip synced to a prerecorded track.\n\nThe 2015 London revival of \"Gypsy\" starring Imelda Staunton was recorded live at the Savoy Theatre during its run and broadcast on BBC Four on 27 December 2015. This recording was released on DVD in November 2016.\n\nIn January 2011, the \"New York Post\" reported that Barbra Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct and star in a new film version of \"Gypsy.\" In an interview with the \"New York Post\", Arthur Laurents said, \"We've talked about it a lot, and she knows what she's doing. She has my approval.\" He said that he would not write the screenplay. In a clarifying statement and report, \"The New York Times\" wrote that Streisand would star, but would not produce or direct. Streisand's spokesperson confirmed that \"there have been conversations\".\n\nHowever, Frank Rizzo of \"courant.com\" reported on March 12, 2011 that the film with Streisand \"is not going to happen, according to playwright-director Arthur Laurents, one of the rights holders to the work.\" But that was contradicted by an August 2011 report by \"USA TODAY\" that the plans for a film adaptation of \"Gypsy\" were still intact. \"Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of \"Gypsy\" starring Streisand as Rose. 'We just have to find our team and a writer,' said Streisand. 'It's too bad, because I was looking forward to working with Arthur,' who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. 'I had seen him a few months before that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.\n\nIn March 2012, reports stated that Universal Pictures was pressing on with the new film. Streisand was still attached to produce and play Rose, with Joel Silver co-producing and Julian Fellowes scripting. \"Playbill\" reported in October 2015 that \"Universal, which had been working with Streisand on the project, formally put \"Gypsy\" in turnaround, meaning it has decided not to develop the film any further. Streisand reportedly has been working with producer Joel Silver on the project, and they are now free to shop their \"Gypsy\" around to other studios.\" In April 2016, it was reported that Streisand was in advanced negotiations to star in and produce the film, which will be directed by Barry Levinson and distributed by STX Entertainment. In July 2016, it was reported that Richard LaGravenese had finished writing the script for the film and that production for the film is aiming to begin in early 2017. However, on August 3, 2016, it was reported that STX Entertainment \"was withdrawing as distributor and co-financier of the film.\"\n\nPrincipal casts and directors of the Broadway and West End stage productions of \"Gypsy\" (Original Broadway Cast and Revivals) (this list shows original cast only, not replacements):\nThere are recordings of each of the Broadway and London productions, as well as the film and television productions. The original 1959 and revival 2003 cast albums each won the Grammy Award, Best Original Cast Show Album.\n\nThe original Broadway cast album was Ethel Merman's first recording in the then-new stereophonic sound technology. Motion pictures recorded in stereo had been steadily made since 1953, and stereo was first used on magnetic tape in 1954, but it was not until 1958, a year before \"Gypsy\" opened, that it became possible to use this technology on records.\n\nThe 1974 Broadway recording was not an actual recording of the Broadway revival, but a remix of the London Cast recording of 1973 with a new recording of \"Some People\".\n\nThe 1989 Broadway cast recording was released in 1990.\n\nThe 2008 Broadway cast recording was released August 28, 2008.\n\nThe 2015 West End cast recording was recorded at Angel Recording Studios in London on 9 March 2015 and was released on 27 April 2015.\n\nThe 2001 Royal Variety Performance featured Cilla Black, Paul O'Grady (in his Lily Savage persona), and Barbara Windsor singing \"You Gotta Get a Gimmick\".\n\n"}
{"id": "488721", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=488721", "title": "Henley Royal Regatta", "text": "Henley Royal Regatta\n\nHenley Royal Regatta (or Henley Regatta, its original name pre-dating Royal patronage) is a rowing event held annually on the River Thames by the town of Henley-on-Thames, England. It was established on 26 March 1839. It differs from the three other regattas rowed over approximately the same course, Henley Women's Regatta, Henley Masters Regatta and Henley Town and Visitors' Regatta, each of which is an entirely separate event.\n\nThe regatta lasts for five days (Wednesday to Sunday) ending on the first weekend in July. Races are head-to-head knock out competitions, raced over a course of 1 mile, 550 yards (2,112 m). The regatta regularly attracts international crews to race. The most prestigious event at the regatta is the Grand Challenge Cup for Men's Eights, which has been awarded since the regatta was first staged.\n\nAs the regatta pre-dates any national or international rowing organisation, it has its own rules and organisation, although it is recognised by both British Rowing (the governing body of rowing in England and Wales) and FISA (the International Federation of Rowing Associations). The regatta is organised by a self-electing body of Stewards, who are largely former rowers themselves. Pierre de Coubertin modelled elements of the organisation of the International Olympic Committee on the Henley Stewards.\n\nThe regatta is regarded as part of the English social season. As with other events in the season, certain enclosures at the regatta have strict dress codes. The Stewards’ Enclosure has a strict dress code of lounge suits for men; women are to wear dresses or skirts with hemlines below the knee and hats are encouraged.\n\nEntries for the regatta close at 6:00 pm sixteen days before the Regatta. In order to encourage a high quality of racing, create a manageable race timetable and to ensure that most crews race only once a day, each event has a limited number of places. Qualifying races are held on the Friday before the regatta. The regatta's Committee of Management decides at its absolute discretion which crews are obliged to qualify; the Committee will examine the form and calibre of the entrants and may choose to pre-qualify some of them.\n\nThe qualifying races take the form of a timed processional race up the regatta course, with the fastest crews qualifying. Times are released for non-qualifying crews only. This does not stop an enthusiastic band of unofficial timers with synchronised watches working out how fast their first round opposition might be.\n\nIf it is apparent that there are a number of outstanding crews in an event, they may be 'selected' by the Stewards, to prevent them from meeting too early in the competition. The regatta insists that selection is not the same as seeding, the main difference being that there is no 'rank order' as is usually the case in, for example, a tennis tournament.\n\nThe draw is a public event that takes place in the Henley town hall, normally at 3 pm on the Saturday before the regatta. For each event the names of all selected crews are placed on pieces of paper which are then drawn at random from the Grand Challenge Cup. These crews are then placed on pre-determined positions on the draw chart, as far apart as possible. The remaining qualifying crews are then drawn from the cup, filling in from the top of the draw chart downwards, until all places have been filled.\n\nEach event in the regatta takes the form of a knockout competition, with each race consisting of two crews racing side by side up the Henley course. The course is marked out by two lines of booms (wooden bars which float on the water, secured between vertical poles), which are placed along the river to form a straight course 2,112 metres long. The course is wide enough to allow two crews to race down with a few metres between them. As such it is not uncommon for inexperienced steersmen or coxswains to crash into the booms, possibly costing their crew the race.\n\nThe race begins at the downstream end of Temple Island, where the crews attach to a pair of pontoons. The race umpire will then call out the names of the two crews and start them when they are both straight and ready. Each crew is assigned to row on either the 'Bucks' (Buckinghamshire) or 'Berks' (Berkshire) side of the race course. The coxswains or steersmen are expected to keep their crew on the allocated side of the course at all times during the race, else they risk disqualification. The only exception is when a crew leads by a sizeable margin and is not deemed by the umpire to be impeding the trailing crew.\n\nThere are several progress markers along the course. Intermediate times are recorded at two of them – \"the Barrier\" and \"Fawley\", in addition to the time to the finish. The regatta has official commentary, which is announced at these points along the course. The commentary is renowned for being unemotional and factual, with the commentator only allowed to announce the rate of striking, which crew is leading, the distance between the crews, and the progress marker which the crews are passing.\n\nHenley Royal Regatta has always been raced over a distance of ‘about one mile and 550 yards’ from Temple Island upstream towards Henley Bridge. However, four distinct courses have been used over the regatta’s history, with smaller changes also being made incrementally. Changes to the course have all been aimed at improving the prospects for fair and safe racing.\n\nThis ran from a point just upstream of Temple Island. At the first regatta in 1839, the finish line was Henley Bridge itself, but it was presumably quickly realised that this had inherent problems. From 1840 onward the finish was moved downstream slightly; eventually a point opposite the lawn of the Red Lion Hotel became the standard finish line. A grandstand was erected for the Stewards and their guests outside the Red Lion. Other spectators could watch from the adjacent roadway (in front of the Little White Hart Hotel) while those with carriages surveyed the scene from a vantage point on Henley Bridge. There were three racing stations (Berkshire, Centre and Buckinghamshire). When only two crews raced, the Centre Station was not used.\n\nThe Old Course had a large lefthand bend in the last quarter-mile. This benefited the crew on the Berkshire side of the course not only because they raced a shorter distance but also because they avoided the worst of the river’s current. Between 1866 and 1885, 57.7% all races were won by the crew on the Berkshire station, with the Buckinghamshire and Centre crews sharing 42.3%. The course was not boomed or piled, although between 1871 and 1873, poles were roped across the bay on the Berkshire side upstream of Poplar Point, in an attempt to minimise the advantage given to the crew on the Berkshire station.\n\nIn 1884, a sub-committee of the regatta’s Committee of Management discussed options for reducing the unfairness of the course. Their recommendation was to move the finish line downstream to Poplar Point (thus avoiding the bend) and the start to the bottom of Temple Island. This was not popular with spectators as it made previous viewing points obsolete. The sub-committee also recommending reducing the racing lanes from three to two and extending racing from two days to three. The Committee gained support from the Captains of competing Clubs and the changes were introduced for the 1886 Regatta.\n\nThe New Course started just downstream of Temple Island, on the Buckinghamshire side and finished opposite the upstream end of Phyllis Court, very close to the current finish line. There were two slight bends (at Remenham and just after Fawley) and a staggered start to compensate for them. The course was also piled for the first time, although not boomed. Unfortunately, it became apparent that in trying to eliminate the unfairness of the Old Course, a new problem had been introduced. Downstream of Fawley, bushes grew alongside the Buckinghamshire bank and provided shelter from the prevailing wind. The course now ran close to this bank and crew on the Buckinghamshire station gained the advantage of shelter whenever a ‘Bushes Wind’ was blowing. From 1886 to 1905, Bucks took 59% of wins against 41% on Berks.\n\nTo attempt to reduce the effect of the Bushes Wind, the course was narrowed and pushed further to the centre of the river. The width was 135 feet in 1887, in 120 feet in 1888 and then progressively until by 1914 it was down to 100 feet at the start tapering to 80 feet at the finish. In 1899, floating booms secured between the pilings which mark the course were also introduced along part of its length in an attempt to keep spectators from obstructing races.\n\nIn around 1920, the Stewards carried out a survey canvassing the idea of a moving the start of the course to the Berkshire side of Temple Island. At the time this channel was a winding, shallow backwater and it would clearly not be possible to lay a course of the full Henley distance without significant alteration to the bank, the island and the riverbed.\n\nFor the 1923 regatta, the Stewards therefore decided to try a shorter experimental straight course which started at the top of the island. This produced 53.2% wins on Bucks and 46.8% on Berks, deemed enough of an improvement on the New Course to justify a permanent change. The consent of the landowners of the Berkshire bank and Temple island (Lord Hambleden and W.D. Mackenzie respectively) was obtained to widen and deepen the Berkshire channel; of material were excavated. The Straight Course was now ready for use.\n\nThe Straight Course runs from the upstream end of Temple Island to a point opposite the upstream end of the Phyllis Court. It is wide. The Straight Course has generally addressed the problems of unfairness: for example, between 1975 and 1984, 50.52% of races were won on Bucks and 49.31% on Berks (with the remainder dead heats). However, when a strong stream is flowing, the Berks station enjoys considerable shelter from the stream, particularly in the last ¼ mile. Conversely, when there is a strong south-westerly wind it is better to be on the Bucks station because it is more sheltered from the wind. The course is now piled and boomed along its entire length, except for crossing points. The booms can present a hazard for the inexperienced coxswain or steersman.\n\nWhen the start and finish positions of the Old Course had become established, the distance between them was found to be 1 mile 570 yds (2131 metres). However, boats were aligned by their sterns at the start and judged by their bows at the finish. This meant that the course was slightly longer for shorter boats (such as single sculls) than for longer boats (such as eights). The length of an eight was assumed to be twenty yards and as such the course came to be described as ‘about 1 mile and 550 yards (2112 metres)’, which was the distance covered by an eight.\n\nIn 1967 the start of the Straight Course was relocated exactly 1 mile 550 yd from the finish. In the same year, moving pontoons were introduced at the start which allowed all boats, from singles to eights, to be aligned with their bows precisely on the start line. Since then all crews have raced a course of exactly one mile and 550 yards (2112 metres).\n\nDuring the whole regatta, during racing hours there are numerous safety boats provided by the Colwick Park Lifeguards to keep competitors safe. The regatta organisers arrange for a first aid provider to be present, who have an on site hospital-style area.\n\nAt a public meeting in Henley town hall on 26 March 1839, Captain Edmund Gardiner proposed \"that from the lively interest which had been manifested at the various boat races which have taken place on the Henley reach during the last few years, and the great influx of visitors on such occasions, this meeting is of the opinion that the establishing of an annual regatta, under judicious and respectable management, would not only be productive of the most beneficial results to the town of Henley, but from its peculiar attractions would also be a source of amusement and gratification to the neighbourhood, and the public in general.\"\n\nThe regatta was first staged in 1839 and proved so successful that it was expanded the next year from one day to two. As the regatta's popularity has grown it has further expanded: to three days in 1886, four days in 1906 and five days in 1986. The regatta has been known as \"Henley Royal Regatta\" since 1851, when Prince Albert became the first royal patron. Since his death, every reigning monarch has agreed to be the patron.\n\nAt the regatta’s inception it was intended for amateur oarsmen rather than those who rowed professionally. In 1879 Henley produced its first formal definition of an amateur:\n\nIn 1884, amateur status for overseas oarsmen was put on the same basis as for home oarsmen, thus ending the concession on racing for money prizes. By 1886 a phrase had also been added debarring any person \"engaged in any menial activity\".\n\nThese rules would become the cause of growing controversy as international entries to Henley increased; most foreign countries having a different definition of amateur. The adoption of Henley's definition of amateur by the Amateur Rowing Association of Great Britain would also cause a 66-year schism in British rowing, when in 1890 a rival National Amateur Rowing Association was set up, with a much more inclusive definition of amateurism.\n\nOne well-known incident was the exclusion of future Olympic champion John B. Kelly Sr., who had served an apprenticeship as a bricklayer, from the 1920 regatta. According to the minutes of the regatta's Committee of Management, Kelly was excluded both because he was not eligible under the manual labour rules and because he was a member of Vesper Boat Club, which was banned in 1906 because members of its 1905 Henley crew had raised money to pay for their trip through public donations – making them professionals in the eyes of the Henley Stewards.\n\nKelly's exclusion was widely reported in newspapers in both the UK and USA, with many seeing it as an attempt to prevent an American from winning the Diamonds. Kelly's son John B. Kelly Jr. would dramatically win the 1947 Diamond Sculls, and his daughter would become the famous Academy Award-winning actress turned Princess of Monaco Grace Kelly, keeping the incident in the public eye for years afterwards.\n\nIn 1936, there was a further controversy when the Australian national eight, preparing for the Berlin Olympics, was excluded from the Grand Challenge Cup because the crew was composed of policemen, deemed to be 'manual workers'. The resulting embarrassment persuaded the Amateur Rowing Association and the Stewards of Henley Royal Regatta of the need for change. On 9 June 1937, the offending references to manual labourers, mechanics, artisans and menial duties were deleted from the ARA rules; Henley's rules were changed the following day, coming into effect from the 1938 regatta.\n\nIn September 1997, FISA removed all references to amateurism in its rules and in December 1998 Henley followed suit. The regatta is therefore now entirely open.\n\nThe first ‘overseas’ entry to the regatta was in 1870 when Trinity College, Dublin entered the Grand, Ladies’, Visitors’ and Wyfold. As Dublin was at that time within the United Kingdom, this was not a foreign entry. TCD won the Visitors’ and reached the final of the Ladies’.\n\nThe first international competitors came in 1878 when G.W. Lee of New Jersey and G. Lee of Boston entered the Diamonds, Shoe-wae-cae-mette BC of Monroe, Michigan, a crew of French Canadian watermen, entered the Stewards’ and Columbia College entered the Stewards’ and Visitors’.\n\nLee of Boston made little progress but Lee of New Jersey lost his heat in a very close race against Tom Edwards-Moss, the eventual winner. Shoe-wae-cae-mette, rowing with then-unusual swivel rowlocks, reached the final of the Stewards’ but lost to London Rowing Club.\n\nColumbia won the Visitors' Challenge Cup, becoming the first foreign winners of a Henley trophy.\n\nUnfortunately, there were accusations that both G.W. Lee and the Shoe-wae-cae-mette crew were not amateurs. This led in 1879 to a new, tighter, definition of amateurism (see above) and a requirement that any entries from outside the United Kingdom must be made on or before 1 March and must be ‘accompanied by a declaration made before Notary Public with regard to the profession of each member of the crew’, and this must be certified by the British Consul, the mayor, or the chief authority of the locality.\n\nUnder these new rules, Shoe-wae-cae-mette were refused entry in 1879 as were Hillsdale Boat Club of Michigan in 1882.\n\nThe Germania Ruder Club of Frankfurt became the first entry from continental Europe in 1880, losing in a heat of the Grand to London Rowing Club.\n\nForeign entries grew over the next twenty years, to the consternation of some who felt that the regatta should be restricted to domestic entries only. There were also a number of disputes over amateurism and the two issues were often bound up together, as in this letter to The Times from Edmond Warre, headmaster of Eton College in 1901:\n\nW.H. Grenfell MP proposed a motion for a special meeting of the Stewards that:\n\nHe proposed amendments to the rules restricting entries to the United Kingdom, and for the Goblets and Diamonds to British subjects domiciled in the UK. Warre seconded his proposals. The Amateur Rowing Association canvassed its member clubs on the proposal and the results were decisive: all clubs opposed the proposals save for Oxford University Boat Club which supported them with the caveat ‘Committee decide against foreign entries provided they can row other than Henley’.\n\nAt a special general meeting of the Stewards late in 1901, a motion moved by Colonel Makins ‘that in the opinion of this meeting it is inexpedient that any alteration in the rules of the regatta be made at present’ was carried by 19 votes to 5.\n\nIn 1906, Royal Club Nautique de Gand of Belgium became the first foreign crew to win the Grand Challenge Cup. A different Ghent Club, Sport Nautique de Gand took the Grand in 1907.\n\nIn advance of 1908, with the Olympic Regatta to be held on the Henley course in mid-July, the Stewards announced a temporary rule change excluding overseas entries from the 1908 regatta (which would take place two weeks before the Olympics). This led to criticism of the Stewards in the British and American press, particularly since it would not permit the Belgians to defend the Grand. The Stewards pointed out in a letter to The Times that the decision had been taken before the 1907 regatta and after consultation with the Belgians. A letter from Oscar Gregoire, President of the Belgian Rowing Federation was quoted:\n\nOverseas entries and wins at the regatta have continued to multiply. Since the 1960s, the open events in particular have almost exclusively become the province of national squad crews. Up to 2007, the Grand Challenge Cup had been won by overseas crews 46 times: 12 times by crews from Germany, 11 from the USA, 9 from the USSR, 4 from Canada, 3 each from Belgium and Australia, 2 from the Netherlands, and 1 each from Switzerland, France, Bulgaria and Croatia.\n\nCrews from the USA have also become frequent winners of the Ladies' Challenge Plate, Temple Challenge Cup and Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup. In 1927, the Kent School Boat Club of Kent School in Connecticut was the first American secondary school to race at the Henley Royal Regatta.\n\nFor most of its history, Henley Royal Regatta has only been open to male competitors but this has changed more recently. Women coxswains of male crews were permitted from 1975 and as such the first female competitor in the regatta was Christine Paul, cox of Furnivall Sculling Club in the Thames Challenge Cup in that year.\n\nThere was much discussion about the introduction of events for women. The Stewards felt that they faced a dilemma: on the one hand it was argued that women's rowing would never flourish while there were no women's events at Britain's premier regatta; on the other it was clear that open women’s events would be dominated by foreign competitors, while events closed to foreign competitors would not serve the desired purpose. Another difficulty was the length of the course. The standard distance for international women's races was at that time 1000 m. It was clear that races over the full Henley course (2112 m) would not be appealing to women's crews preparing for international championships.\n\nPeter Coni, who was elected as Chairman of the regatta’s Committee of Management in 1978, was supportive of the idea of introducing women's events. However, he had had little time to take any action when there was an attempt to force the issue. Kingston Rowing Club sent in an entry for the Double Sculls Challenge Cup in the names of A.Hohl and P.Bird. The crew was in fact Great Britain internationals Astrid Ayling and Pauline Hart, who had made the entry under their maiden names. The regatta realised the subterfuge and Coni made a statement to the press in which he said that it was 'sad that a long-established club should think it reasonable behaviour to make a deliberately false declaration'. He added that the stewards had no fear of the Sex Discrimination Act.\n\nIn 1979, the Committee announced that there would be exhibition events for women in 1981, with entries by invitation only:\n\nThe entries were limited to four in each event (Coxed Fours and Double Sculls); two from abroad and two from the UK. The standard was good, but it was reckoned that the course from the Barrier start (over 600 m longer than the international standard 1000 m) contributed to there being no close verdicts.\n\nIn 1982, a Single Sculls Event was added and the start was moved to Fawley so that the course was closer to 1000 m. As the intermediate start installations were required for the shorter distance, the races had to take place during intervals in the normal racing programme (the lunch or tea breaks) which meant that only the dedicated stayed to watch. This was a pity, since the final of the Women's Invitation Single was a highlight of the regatta, with Beryl Mitchell of Thames Tradesmen’s Rowing Club (World Silver medallist in 1981) beating Stephanie Foster of Waiariki Rowing Club, New Zealand (World Bronze medallist in 1982) by one length. Astrid Ayling was also able to race legitimately, winning the Invitation Double Sculls event with Rosie Clugston. The time taken to install the start equipment at Fawley combined with the relative lack of crowd interest meant that the Stewards took the decision not to repeat the experiment in 1983.\n\nThe change of the international distance to 2000 m and the addition of a fifth day to the regatta in 1986 allowed the Committee of Management to revisit the decision. In 1993 the regatta introduced an open Women’s Single Sculls event and from 1993–6 this counted as a round of the FISA World Cup. The first winner was Maria Brandin of Sweden and she subsequently won a further four times. Fittingly, the prizegiver in 1993 was Peter Coni. In 1996, the Stewards purchased a silver cup as a challenge trophy and named it the Princess Royal Challenge Cup; it was presented for the first time in 1997.\n\nAn invitation event for women's eights was added in 1998. In 2000, this was replaced by an open women's eights event under the same rules as the Grand Challenge Cup. In 2002, the Remenham Challenge Cup was donated by Remenham Club as the trophy for this event. At the 2001 Regatta, an open event for Women's Quadruple Sculls was introduced. In 2003, this event became known as the Princess Grace Challenge Cup in memory of Princess Grace of Monaco. Her father, John B. Kelly Sr., had been controversially excluded from the Diamond Sculls in 1920 because of the regattas rules on amateurism; her brother, John B. Kelly Jr. had won the Diamonds Sculls in 1947 and in 1949. Princess Grace was the Regatta prizegiver in 1981.\n\nAt the Stewards' meeting in December 2016, it was agreed to equalise the number of events for Men and Women in the Open category, leading to the creation of three new events: the Women's Fours, the Women's Pairs and the Women's Double Sculls. These were raced for the first time at the 2017 Regatta.\n\nHenley hosted the rowing events of the London Olympic Games in mid-July 1908, two weeks after the Royal Regatta. The course was extended downstream and upstream, making it and . Events for single sculls, coxless pairs, coxless fours and eights were offered but only the eights produced an international final.\n\nA meeting arranged by Leander Club in January 1919 concluded that it was too soon to revive the regatta but asked the Stewards to arrange a “Peace Regatta” and a four-day regatta was duly staged. Competition was not for the usual Henley trophies but for different cups and some events were restricted to ‘armed services’ crews.\n\nA two-day ‘Royal Henley Regatta’ (as opposed to Henley Royal Regatta) was staged between VE Day and VJ Day. Crews rowed three-abreast over a shortened course beginning at the Remenham Barrier. As in 1919, different trophies to the usual regatta prizes were on offer.\n\nThe canoeing and rowing events for the 1948 London Olympic Games were contested in early August, a month after the Royal Regatta. The course was widened to accommodate three lanes and shortened to start at the top of Temple Island: the distance was approximately 1980 metres – 20 metres short of the standard international distance. Twenty seven nations competed and events for single sculls, double sculls, coxless pairs, coxed pairs, coxless fours, coxed fours and eights were offered.\n\nThe Olympic races in 2012 were held at Dorney Lake.\n\nThe racing can be viewed from a number of locations along both banks of the Thames. Areas open to the general public are generally on the Berkshire (towpath) side of the river. Viewing opportunities on the other side of the river (Buckinghamshire) side are limited to the Phyllis Court club, private residences and areas for corporate entertainment. A channel of the river remains open throughout the regatta, hence racing can also be viewed from boats although mooring is tightly restricted.\n\nThe enclosure situated on the Berkshire side, adjacent to the last part of the course and the finish line. It comprises two covered grandstands, a restaurant marquee, several bars, a bandstand and so on – all set in immaculately prepared lawns. It is only open to the Stewards of the Regatta, members of the Stewards' Enclosure and their guests. Overseas competitors are also given the opportunity to purchase tickets.\n\nThe Stewards' Enclosure as understood today, an enclosure open to members (elected by the Committee of Management of the Regatta) and their guests, came into being in 1919 with a membership of 300. This grew to 704 in 1939 and 1,500 in 1956. In 1980 the Stewards set a ceiling of 5,000. The waiting list for membership of the Stewards Enclosure is now several years long, although preference is given to people who have previously competed at the regatta. The waiting list has grown rapidly since the 1970s, when membership could be applied for and granted on the same day.\n\nThe social position of the event means that some in the Stewards' Enclosure (and elsewhere along the course) may have no interest in the actual rowing.\n\nThe Stewards' Enclosure is also known for a strict enforcement of its dress code. Men are required to wear a \"lounge suit, blazer and flannels, or evening dress, and a tie\". Women are required to wear a dress or skirt that covers their knees, and are \"encouraged to wear a hat\" (although women wearing hats is often frowned upon in higher rowing circles). Anyone not suitably dressed can be refused entry, no matter their prestige in rowing or elsewhere. Mobile phone use is also prohibited.\n\nThe regatta prizegiving takes place in the Stewards' Enclosure after the conclusion of racing on Sunday.\n\nThe Regatta Enclosure is situated immediately downstream of the Stewards Enclosure and further away from the finish. This enclosure is open to all on payment of the admission fee. Competitors gain free access to this area. There is no dresscode.\n\nRemenham Club is situated a little over halfway along the course on the Berkshire side of the river. It is a social club run by and for members of seven rowing clubs on the Thames (the \"Founding Clubs\"): Kingston Rowing Club, London Rowing Club, Molesey Boat Club, Staines Boat Club, Thames Rowing Club, Twickenham Rowing Club and Vesta Rowing Club. Remenham Club is open only to its members and guests. It has a similar dresscode to the Stewards Enclosure, though the rules on women's outfits are less restrictive.\n\nThe clubhouse and frontage of the Upper Thames Rowing Club is on the Berkshire side of the river, immediately downstream of Remenham Club. It has historically had an informal atmosphere and no dresscode. It is only open to its members and their guests. In 2011, UTRC initiated the Upper Thames Enclosure to include a fairly relaxed dress code. UTRC lease the land downstream of their clubhouse to retailers, food vendors and bars.\n\nRemenham Farm spans the riverside on the Berkshire side of the Thames from opposite the Fawley box to a point just upstream of the Barrier (approximately the 1100 m – 700m points on the regatta course). It is owned by The Copas Partnership.\n\nDuring the Regatta it runs hospitality enclosures at The Temple Island Enclosure and The Courtyard Enclosure, and bars including the \"Barn Bar\". Remenham Farm is open to the public and entrance fees apply for certain enclosures, boat moorings are also available.\n\nThe clubhouse and grounds of Leander Club is situated on the Berkshire side of the river beyond the finish line of the regatta course, between the boat tents and Henley Bridge. Leander Club has a large marquee constructed for the regatta week and holds a large function on the Saturday night of the Regatta. It is open only to its members and their guests and has a formal dresscode.\n\nThe Phyllis Court Club is situated on the Buckinghamshire side of the river, opposite the finish line. It is open only to its members and their guests. Although it has an excellent view of the finish line, it is not generally frequented by rowers, being principally a lawn sports club.\n\nThe following events will be offered at the 2018 regatta:\n\n\n\n\n"}

While it was only Beuys’s first solo exhibition in a private gallery, it is sometimes referred to as his best known action.\n\nAt the beginning of the performance Beuys locked the gallery doors from the inside, leaving the gallery-goers outside. They could observe the scene within only through the windows. With his head entirely coated in honey and gold leaf, he began to explain pictures to a dead hare. Whispering to the dead animal on his arm in an apparent dialog, he processed through the exhibit from artwork to artwork. Occasionally he would stop and return to the center of the gallery, where he stepped over a dead fir tree that lay on the floor. After three hours the public was let into the room. Beuys sat upon a stool in the entrance area with the hare on his arm and his back to the onlookers.\n\nThe performance was the high point of Beuys' development of a broadened definition of art, which had already begun in his drawings of the 1950s. He celebrated the ritual of \"explaining art\" with an action that was, for his viewers, effectively silent. \n\nThe relationship between thought, speech, and form in this performance was also characteristic of Beuys. In his last speech \"Speaking about Germany\" (German: \"Sprechen über Deutschland\", 1985) he emphasized that he was essentially a man of words. In another instance he is quoted as saying: \"When I speak, I try to guide that power's impulse so that it flows into a more fully descriptive language, which is the spiritual perception of growth.\" The integration of speech and conversation into his visual works plays a meaningful role in \"How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare\".\n\nThe hare is an animal with broad, centuries-old symbolic meaning in many religions. In Greek mythology it was associated with the love goddess Aphrodite, to the Romans and Germanic tribes it was a symbol of fertility, and in Christianity it came to be connected with the Resurrection. This interpretation is also supported by the \"mask\" that Beuys wore during his performance: gold as a symbol for the power of the sun, wisdom, and purity, and honey as a Germanic symbol for rebirth. \n\nBeuys explained:\nThe performance is considered a key work, and was re-created by Marina Abramović in 2005 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York as part of her series \"Seven Easy Pieces\". \n\nSuch materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey was the product of bees who, for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemy, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for the masculine principles of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described \"by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century,\" though Beuys did not agree with that. \n\nThe English translations of quotes from Beuys used in this article are not in any way official. Any misrepresentation of the artist's meaning is unintentional. For the purpose of transparency the original German is presented below.\n\n"}
{"id": "1688154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1688154", "title": "Incorruptibility", "text": "Incorruptibility\n\nIncorruptibility is a Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox belief that divine intervention allows some human bodies (specifically saints and beati) to avoid the normal process of decomposition after death as a sign of their holiness. Bodies that undergo little or no decomposition, or delayed decomposition, are sometimes referred to as \"incorrupt\" or \"incorruptible\".\n\nIncorruptibility is thought to occur even in the presence of factors which normally hasten decomposition, as in the cases of saints Catherine of Genoa, Julie Billiart and Francis Xavier.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism, if a body is judged as incorruptible after death, this is generally seen as a sign that the individual is a saint. Canon law allows inspection of the body so that relics can be taken and sent to Rome. The relics must be sealed with wax and the body must be replaced after inspection. These ritual inspections are performed very rarely and can only be performed by a bishop respecting canon law. A pontifical commission can authorize inspection of the relics and demand a written report. After solemn inspection of the relics, it can be decided that the body is presented in an open reliquary and displayed for veneration. Catholic law allows saints to be buried under the altar, so Mass can be celebrated above the corpse.\n\nThe relics of Saint Bernadette were inspected multiple times, and reports by the church tribunal confirmed that the body was preserved. The opening of the reliquary was attended by multiple canons, the mayor and the bishop in 1919, and repeated in 1925.\n\nNot every saint, however, is expected to have an incorruptible corpse. Although incorruptibility is recognized as supernatural, it is no longer counted as a miracle in the recognition of a saint.\n\nEmbalmed bodies were not recognized as incorruptibles. For example, although the body of Pope John XXIII remained in a remarkably intact state after its exhumation, Church officials remarked that the body had been embalmed and additionally there was a lack of oxygen in his sealed triple coffin.\n\nIncorruptibility is seen as distinct from the good preservation of a body, or from mummification. Incorruptible bodies are often said to have the odour of sanctity, exuding a sweet or floral, pleasant aroma.\n\nTo the Eastern Orthodox Church, a distinction is made between natural mummification and what is believed to be supernatural incorruptibility. While incorruptibility is not generally deemed to be a prerequisite for sainthood, there are a great number of eastern Orthodox saints whose bodies have been found to be incorrupt and are in much veneration among the faithful. These include:\n\nThe saints and other Christian holy men and women whose bodies are said to be or to have been incorrupt have been catalogued in \"The Incorruptibles: A Study of the Incorruption of the Bodies of Various Catholic Saints and Beati\", a 1977 book by Joan Carroll Cruz.\n\nDuring marble excavations on the Appian Way in Spring 1485, workers found three marble coffins. In one, twelve feet underground, was the corpse of a young woman, said to have looked as if it had been buried that day, despite being about 1500 years old. The corpse attracted 20,000 plus crowds of spectators in the first few days, many of whom believed it to be of Tullia, daughter of Cicero, whose epitaph was on one of the tombs.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Previous year's \"Infierno en el Ring\" events have been held on Fridays, replacing CMLL's regularly scheduled Super Viernes show, but in 2010 the event was held on Sunday night instead. The 2010 Infierno en el Ring is the third show under that name and the 13th time CMLL have promoted an \"Infierno en el Ring\" cage match.\n\nThe main event of the show will be the eponymous \"Infierno en el Ring\" match that CMLL traditionally has traditionally held approximately once a year and which has headlined its own specific show since 2008. The \"Infierno en el Ring\" match is a multi-man Steel Cage match contested under \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match, rules which means that the loser of the match would be forced to unmask per. Lucha Libre traditions. At the 2010 event 12 wrestlers will put their mask on the line in the match: Ángel de Oro, Ángel de Plata, Ángel Azteca Jr., Diamante, Fabián el Gitano, Sensei, Hooligan, Monster, Puma King, Tiger Kid, Doctor X and Histeria. The match saw Ángel de Oro pin Fabián el Gitano to unmask him. The show also featured three Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match and a tag team match to open the show.\n\nThe Mexican wrestling company \"Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre\" (Spanish for \"World Wrestling Council\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker \"Infierno en el Ring\" (\"Inferno in the Ring\"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man steel cage match, the eponymous \"Infierno en el Ring\" match. CMLL has use the \"Infierno en el Ring\" match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as \"Infierno en el Ring\", with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All \"Infierno en el Ring\" shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \"home\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the \"Infierno en el Ring\" \" shows replace their regularly scheduled \"Super Viernes\" show. The 2010 \"Infierno en el Ring\" show was the third show to use the name.\n\nThe event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe foundation of the 12-man steel cage match storyline began around April, 2010 with a developing rivalry between the \"tecnico\" (good guy) Fabián el Gitano and the \"rudo\" (bad guy) Doctor X on CMLL's secondary shows in Guadalajara, Jalisco. After a month of mask challenges between the two the feud was finally featured in CMLL's main venue, Arena Mexico in late May, indicating that a potential \"Lucha de Apuestas\", mask vs. mask match, could be happening soon. Throughout May and June several other mid-card wrestlers became involved in storylines that saw \"Apuesta\" challenges made. The team of Ángel de Oro, Ángel de Plata and Sensei challenged the team of Puma King, Tiger Kid and Arkangel de la Muerte to an \"Apuesta\" match after Arkangel cheated to win a trios match. When the \"Infierno en el Ring\" match was finally announced Arkangel de la Muerte was not among the participants, instead his \"Los Guerreros Tuareg\" teammate Hooligan was in addition to Ángel Azteca Jr., Diamante and \"Los Invasores\" members Monster and Histeria. Histeria's inclusion in the match was a bit of a surprise as he was also scheduled to participate in a 10 man \"Lucha de Apuesta\" match on June 12, only 6 days before \"Infierno en el Ring\", with the booking either revealing that Histeria was keeping his mask, or announced as a misdirection to make Histeria's mask loss on June 12 more of a surprise.\n\nThe announced undercard featured three Six-man \"Lucha Libre rules\" tag team match, the most common match form in CMLL. These matches feature a combination of ongoing storylines, emerging storylines or seemingly random teams. In the semi-main event Místico teams up with Shocker and Brazo de Plata to take on Jushin Thunder Liger, Atlantis and Héctor Garza. The two main focal points in the match is Místico's rivalry with New Japan Pro Wrestling's Jushin Thunder Liger who's on tour with CMLL, potentially building to a title match between the two over the CMLL World Welterweight Championship which Liger holds. The other storyline featured in the semi-main event is the feud between Brazo de Plata and Héctor Garza. Plata and Garza used to team together, with Garza even helping Brazo de Plata losing some of his considerable weight. In May, 2010 Héctor Garza turned \"rudo\" on his friends, attacking them during a match and ever since he has been at odds with Brazo de Plata.\n\nIn the third match of the night Mexican National Welterweight Champion Valiente teamed up with the reigning CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Stuka Jr. and Fuego. They will take on the team of Misterioso II, who was looking for a title match with Valiente and Virus and Euforia who represented the group \"Los Cancerberos del Infierno\", which has been trying to take the Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship away from the current champions.\n\nThe show opened with the man who was unmasked the last time CMLL held an \"Infierno en el Ring\" match, Tigre Blanco teaming up with the rookie Metatron to take on the team of Inquisidor and El Cholo, who had been paired up for the show. The \"tecnico\" team of Tigre and Metatron won the first fall when Metatron pinned Inquisidor and Tigre Blanco pinned Cholo. In the second fall the \"rudo\" team tied up the score 1-1 when Cholo pinned Metatron and Inquisidor pinned Tigre Blanco. The third fall was the longest of the match and saw Tigre Blanco win the match for his team.\n\nThe second match of the night saw two substitutes take place compared to the original card. Luna Mágica was originally scheduled to team with Lady Apache and Marcela, but was replaced with Dalys la Caribeña, the wife of Negro Casas who made her wrestling debut in 2010. On the \"Rudo\" side Mima Shimoda was supposed to team up with \"Las Zorras\" (\"The Foxes\"; Princesa Blanca and Princesa Sujei), but instead they teamed up with La Seductora without any explanations of why the replacements were made. \"Las Zorras\" took the first fall after Princesa Sujei pinned Lady Apache following a \"Torbellino\" splash and Princesa Blanca pinned Dalys. In the second fall the \"tecnicas\" regained momentum when Marcela executed what was described as a \"brutal Michinoku Driver\" on La Seductora and pinned her. In the final fall Dalys la Caribeña uses the Casas trademark \"La Casita\" cradle to gain the three count and the victory for her team. Following the match Lady Apache and Marcela hugged, showing no signs of animosity despite being booked for a singles match against each other on the following Super Viernes.\n\nMisterioso II and \"Los Cancerberos\" both improved their chances of gaining a championship match down the line as they defeated Mexican National Welterweight Champion Valiente and CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Champions Stuka Jr. and Fuego two falls to one. Misterioso pinned Fuego and Virus pinned Stuka Jr. In the second fall the champions Valiente took out Virus with a \"Topé suicida\" while Stuka Jr. pinned Misteriosos after a \"Plancha\" style splash. Despite a moment of miscommunication where Misterioso kicked Euforia the team still managed to win the match when Misterioso pinned Fuego. Following the match the \"rudos\" shook hands, clearing up any misunderstandings between them.\n\nThe fourth match saw two replacements made just like the second match of the night had. On the \"tecnico\" side Máximo replaced his father Brazo de Plata, teaming with Místico and Shocker while Héctor Garza was replaced by Último Guerrero teaming up with fellow \"Los Guerreros del Atlantidad\" member Atlantis and Jushin Thunder Liger. Liger almost won the first fall for his team when he applied a submission move on Máximo, but before Máximo could submit Místico and Shocker surprised \"Los Guerreros\" by rolling them up for the pinfall victory. Liger's team gained a measure of revenge when Liger pinned Shocker after a Ligerbomb. The third and deciding fall came when Místico used his trademark \"La Mística\" submission hold, giving the \"tecnicos\" the 2-1 victory.\n\nThe CMLL crew took less than 15 minutes to set up the steel cage for the main event, which was fast for the type of cage that CMLL uses. After the cage was assembled the participants for the \"Infierno en el Ring\" match came to the ring, \"tecnicos\" first (Ángel de Oro, Ángel de Plata, Ángel Azteca Jr., Diamante, Fabián el Gitano and Sensei) followed by the \"rudos\" (Doctor X, Hooligan, Puma King, Tiger Kid, Monster and Histeria). Before the match it was announced that there would be a three-minute time limit where wrestlers were not allowed to escape the cage. Once the bell rings all 12 wrestlers began fighting, some pairing up against the wrestlers they had been feuding with for a while, Dr. X and Fabián el Gitano, \"Los Ángeles\" and Puma King and Tiger Kid. The theme of the match was \"every man for himself\", demonstrated by Hooligan as he was the first man to escape after the time limit expired, distracting his teammate Doctor X in order to escape the cage. Ángel de Oro and Ángel de Plata both climbed the cage at the same time, only to have Ángel de Plata pull his brother off the cage so he could escape himself. While the other wrestlers were preoccupied Monster saw an opening and climbed out of the cage, the third man to escape the match. Moments later Sensei becomes the fourth man to escape the cage, keeping his mask safe. The brother team of Puma King and Tiger Kid are the next to try to escape the cage, but like with the Ángel brothers Tiger Kid prevented his brother from escaping so that he could get out of the cage himself. Out next was Ángel Azteca Jr. who climbed over the cage to ensure he would not have to fight for his mask that night. Puma King and Ángel de Oro seemed to work together to escape the cage, only for Puma King to double cross Ángel de Oro so that Puma King could escape the cage. With Diamante's escape there are only four wrestlers left in the ring. Histeria quickly abandons fellow \"rudo\" Doctor X to escape the cage, saving his match for the second time in a week. In the cage Ángel de Oro accidentally hit Fabián el Gitano when he was trying to hit Doctor X. This gave the Doctor an opening to escape the cage, choosing to leave the cage instead of trying to punish his rival Fabián el Gitano further.\n\nSince Ángel de Oro and Fabián el Gitano were the last two men left in the cage they were forced to wrestle against each other under \"Lucha de Apuesta\" rules inside the cage. After a short match between the two Ángel de Oro pinned Fabián, earning his first mask victory of his career. Following the match Fabián el Gitano unmasked, then announced that he real name was Emilio Fabian Fernandez de Leon born in Mexico City, 38 years old and had 16 years of wrestling experience. Following Ángel de Oro's victory his brother Ángel de Plata came to the ring to congratulate his brother without any signs of resentment for the actions taken during the match.\n"}

He is well-known around the world as the creator of a music method: \"Kodály method\". Foreign musicians from all over the world come to see his birthplace, \"Kecskemét\" to get some inspiration, learn his method for a better pedagogy and listen to Hungarian choirs and concerts. These are the main points for musicians to visit \"Kecskemét, Bács-Kiskun county\".\n\n1970 was the year when the name and the event was born. \"Zoltán Kodály\"\"’s widow\" and the primary and secondary Kodály school’s director, \"Márta\" \"Nemesszeghyné Szentkirályi\" had an idea about an international summer course. For their initiation the city advertised this course for learning the Hungarian music teaching in schools and the method’s basics. A lot of people interested in this course, so after two years the International Kodály Seminar was held again, second time. The first was in 1970 and the second, two years later, in 1972.\n\nSince 1975, \"the Kodály Institute of the Liszt Ferenc Academy\" was active, they started organising the third Kodály Seminar. /The Seminar is organized every second year. An International Music Festival is also held at the same time./ While the first two courses’ main goal was for foreign professional musicians and was about the school teaching in music schools, since 1975 there was a big change, because they wanted to make the courses interesting for the Hungarian pedagogues too.\n\nTheir programmes, variations of opportunities was also motivating for the Hungarian audience. The aim of the Kodály Seminars was that: refreshing the possibilities, abilities to help the music teachers, conductors in their daily work. Kodály Seminar became year by year a voluntary self-education course; how to be a “good musician” and the human and professional music symbol.\n\nNowadays the aim of these courses is the comprehensive demonstration of the Hungarian music education in practical and pedagogical works, Kodály’s and Bartók’s lifework. The programme consists of daily conducting lessons, solfege lessons, methodology classes, choral singing and concerts.\n\nIn 1987 with the Seminar the International Kodály Symposium was held; a new summer programme started. Workshops were in different topics: folk music, music analysis.\n\nThe 20th International Kodály Seminar was held in 1999 which was the Jubilee of the tradition since 1970.\n\nThere have been approximately 2200 participants from 42 different countries during the Seminars.\n\nIn this year (17-28 July 2017) will be the 29th International Kodaly Seminar with a lot of programmes and concerts.\n\n"}

Approximately 700 people attend the lunch, held in the Château de Meursault.\n\nThe event was formally organized in the mid-1920s by the Count Lafon. Traditionally, the winemakers would compete to bring the best bottle of wine to impress their favorite clients. In the modern era, Dominique Lafon, grandson of Count Lafon, participates in and helps organize the event.\n\nSince 2000, Daniel Johnnes has been hosting La Paulée de New York and La Paulée de San Francisco, which have been officially recognized by the organizers of the original La Paulée de Meursault.

This practise is performed by all schools of Buddhism: Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana. It is known as \"Tsethar\" in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nWhile this practise of life release may naturally need to be spontaneous to successfully save an endangered life, life release can also be planned. Planning often involves purchasing an animal directly from a slaughterhouse or a fishermen; this can often take place on auspicious days in the Buddhist calendar in order for the merit of the act to be multiplied thousands of times. Animals are blessed before being safely returned to their natural environment as prayers are made and often dedicated to someone who is ill or has died, with the belief that person will benefit too from this dedication.\n\nIn Tibet an animal is often marked by a ribbon to indicate that the life of the animal has been liberated, with the general understanding that it will be allowed to die of natural causes. The practise in Tibetan Buddhism has been championed in recent times by Chatral Rinpoche, Dilgo Khyentse Yangsi Rinpoche and Ogyen Trinley Dorje. Although this is seen to be the traditional way of carrying out this practise, Ogyen Trinley Dorje has commented that the meaning is broad and that people can use their intelligence to expand the practise in other ways; indicating that planting one tree may be more beneficial that carrying out Tsethar for many beings.\n\nIt is increasingly recognized that animal release has the potential for negative environmental impacts, including as a pathway for the introduction of invasive species into non-native environments. This may lead to biodiversity loss over time. For example, competition from American Red-eared slider turtles released in China's lakes has been reported to cause death of native turtles.\n\nFurther, some animals are captured for the explicit purpose of being released, or are released into environments where they are unable to survive.\n\n"}

The tour visited five continents and Beyoncé was lauded by music journalism for her simultaneous dancing and singing abilities. Following the release of her 2008 third studio album \"I Am... Sasha Fierce\", Beyoncé embarked on her next world concert venture, the I Am... World Tour. She collaborated with Thierry Mugler exclusively for the tour's costumes. The I Am... World Tour also marked the first time Beyoncé had performed in South American countries. Beyoncé saw her largest tour to date with 2013-2014's The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. Grossing US $229,727,960, the 132 date venture was criticised for the name of the tour, as Beyoncé appeared to be letting herself be known as simply Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter's wife, despite being proclaimed as a \"modern-day feminist\". The tour itself however was lauded by music critics, who again praised Beyoncé's performance abilities and the more advanced production seen compared to her previous tours.\nIn 2016 Beyoncé saw her most successful tour to date, The Formation Tour grossing more than U$260.000.000 in just 49 shows.\n\nBeside her solo live performances, Beyoncé has also embarked on two collaborative tours. In 2004, she embarked on The Verizon Ladies First Tour in which she co-headlined with Alicia Keys and Missy Elliott. Beyoncé and Keys were widely regarded as the stars of the North American show, although generally, music critics praised the entire ensemble. In 2014, Beyoncé took part in her second collaborative tour; the On the Run Tour, in which she was co-headlining with her aforementioned husband, Jay-Z. The all-stadium tour that took place predominantly in North America as well as two performances in Paris, France, came after both Beyoncé and Jay-Z had finished their own solo tours. The tour was commended for its extensive theme and cinematic storyline, as well as both performers onstage abilities. It grossed US $109.7 million, ranking as the fifth highest grossing tour of 2014.\n\nOutside of extensive world tours, Beyoncé has also performed a variety of concert residencies and smaller, promotional tours. 2009's I Am... Yours was carried out amongst the time the I Am... World Tour was ongoing. Other residencies include 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, carried out in August 2011 to promote Beyoncé's fourth studio album \"4\", and 2012's , regarded as her postbirth comeback performance, after giving birth in January 2012. In 2013, Beyoncé headlined the Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, performing a medley of her solo and Destiny's Child recordings (with the latter reuniting on stage for a surprise performance). Generating 110.8 million viewers, the performance is currently the fifth most watched halftime show of all time in the United States, behind Katy Perry, Bruno Mars, Madonna, Coldplay and Lady Gaga. She was featured as a special guest during Coldplay's performance at the show in 2016 along with Bruno Mars.\n"}

{"id": "21475328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21475328", "title": "Lost Decade (Japan)", "text": "Lost Decade (Japan)\n\nThe is a period of economic stagnation in Japan following the Japanese asset price bubble's collapse in late 1991 and early 1992. The term originally referred to the years from 1991 to 2000, but recently the decade from 2001 to 2010 is often included so that the whole period is referred to as the Lost Score or the Lost 20 Years (失われた二十年, \"Ushinawareta Nijūnen\"). Broadly impacting the entire Japanese economy, over the period of 1995 to 2007, GDP fell from $5.33 trillion to $4.36 trillion in nominal terms, real wages fell around 5%, while the country experienced a stagnant price level. While there is some debate on the extent and measurement of Japan's setbacks, the economic effect of the Lost Decade is well established and Japanese policymakers continue to grapple with its consequences. \n\nJapan's strong economic growth in the second half of the 20th century ended abruptly at the start of the 1990s. The Plaza Accord doubling of the exchange rate value of the dollar versus the yen between 1985 to 1987 fueled a speculative asset price bubble of a massive scale. The bubble was caused by the excessive loan growth quotas dictated on the banks by Japan's central bank, the Bank of Japan, through a policy mechanism known as the \"window guidance\". As economist Paul Krugman explained, \"Japan's banks lent more, with less regard for quality of the borrower, than anyone else's. In doing so they helped inflate the bubble economy to grotesque proportions.\"\n\nTrying to deflate speculation and keep inflation in check, the Bank of Japan sharply raised inter-bank lending rates in late 1989. This sharp policy caused the bursting of the bubble and the Japanese stock market crashed. Equity and asset prices fell, leaving overly leveraged Japanese banks and insurance companies with books full of bad debt. The financial institutions were bailed out through capital infusions from the government, loans and cheap credit from the central bank, and the ability to postpone the recognition of losses, ultimately turning them into zombie banks. Yalman Onaran of Bloomberg News writing in \"Salon\" stated that the zombie banks were one of the reasons for the following long stagnation. Additionally Michael Schuman of \"Time\" magazine noted that these banks kept injecting new funds into unprofitable \"zombie firms\" to keep them afloat, arguing that they were too big to fail. However, most of these companies were too debt-ridden to do much more than survive on bail-out funds. Schuman believed that Japan's economy did not begin to recover until this practice had ended.\n\nEventually, many of these failing firms became unsustainable, and a wave of consolidation took place, resulting in four national banks in Japan. Many Japanese firms were burdened with heavy debts, and it became very difficult to obtain credit. Many borrowers turned to sarakin (loan sharks) for loans. As of 2012, the official interest rate was 0.1%; the interest rate has remained below 1% since 1994.\n\nDespite mild economic recovery in the 2000s, conspicuous consumption of the 1980s has not returned to the same pre-crash levels. Difficult times in the 1990s made people frown on ostentatious displays of wealth, while Japanese firms such as Toyota and Sony which had dominated their respective industries in the 1980s had to fend off strong competition from rival firms based in other East Asian countries, particularly South Korea. Many Japanese companies replaced a large part of their workforce with temporary workers, who had little job security and fewer benefits. As of 2009, these non-traditional employees made up more than a third of the labor force. For the wider Japanese workforce, wages have stagnated. From their peak in 1997, real wages have since fallen around 13%—an unprecedented number among developed nations.\n\nThe wider economy of Japan is still recovering from the impact of the 1991 crash and subsequent lost decades. It took 12 years for Japan's GDP to recover to the same levels as 1995. And as a greater sign of economic malaise, Japan also fell behind in output per capita. In 1991, real output per capita in Japan was 14% higher than that of Australia, but in 2011 real output had dropped to 14% below Australia's levels. In the span of 20 years, Japan's economy was overtaken not only in gross output, but labor efficiency, whereas previously it was a global leader in both.\n\nIn response to chronic deflation and low growth, Japan has attempted economic stimulus and thereby run a fiscal deficit since 1991. These economic stimuli have had at best nebulous effects on the Japanese economy and have contributed to the huge debt burden on the Japanese government. Expressed as a percentage of GDP, at 240% Japan has the highest level of debt of any nation on earth. While Japan's is a special case where the majority of public debt is held in the domestic market and by the Bank of Japan, the sheer size of the debt demands large service payments and is a worrying sign of the country's financial health.\n\nEconomist Paul Krugman has argued that Japan's lost decade is an example of a liquidity trap (a situation in which monetary policy is unable to lower nominal interest rates because these are close to zero). He explained how truly massive the asset bubble was in Japan by 1990, with a tripling of land and stock market prices during the prosperous 1980s. Japan's high personal savings rates, driven in part by the demographics of an aging population, enabled Japanese firms to rely heavily on traditional bank loans from supporting banking networks, as opposed to issuing stock or bonds via the capital markets to acquire funds. The cozy relationship of corporations to banks and the implicit guarantee of a taxpayer bailout of bank deposits created a significant moral hazard problem, leading to an atmosphere of crony capitalism and reduced lending standards. In so doing they helped inflate the bubble economy to grotesque proportions.\" The Bank of Japan began increasing interest rates in 1990 due in part to concerns over the bubble and in 1991 land and stock prices began a steep decline, within a few years reaching 60% below their peak.\n\nEconomist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to become insolvent, meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero interest rates and expansion of the money supply to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type Great Depression, in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities. In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.\n\nEconomist Scott Sumner has argued that Japan's monetary policy was too tight during the Lost Decade and thus prolonged the pain felt by the Japanese economy.\n\nEconomists Fumio Hayashi and Edward Prescott argue that the anemic performance of the Japanese economy since the early 1990s is mainly due to the low growth rate of aggregate productivity. Their hypothesis stands in direct contrast to popular explanations that are based in terms of an extended credit crunch that emerged in the aftermath of a bursting asset “bubble.” They are led to explore the implications of their hypothesis on the basis of evidence that suggests that despite the ongoing difficulties in the Japanese banking sector, desired capital expenditure was for the most part fully financed. They suggest that Japan’s sluggish investment activity is likely to be better understood in terms of low levels of desired capital expenditure and not in terms of credit constraints that prohibit firms from financing projects with positive net present value (NPV). Monetary or fiscal policies might increase consumption in the short run, but unless productivity growth increases, there is a legitimate fear that such a policy may simply transform Japan from a low-growth/low-inflation economy to a low-growth/high-inflation economy.\n\nIn her analysis of Japan's gradual path to economic success and then quick reversal, Jennifer Amyx noted that Japanese experts were not unaware of the possible causes of Japan's economic decline. Rather, to return Japan's economy back to the path to economic prosperity, policymakers would have had to adopt policies that would first cause short-term harm to the Japanese people and government. Under this analysis, says Ian Lustick, Japan was stuck on a \"local maximum,\" which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level, set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s. Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility, Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions and even though experts may have known which changes needed to be made, they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies which would have been harmful in the short-term. Lustick's analysis is rooted in the application of evolutionary theory and natural selection to understanding institutional rigidity in the social sciences.\n\nAfter the Great Recession of 2007–2009, many Western governments and commentators have referenced the Lost Decade as a distinct economic possibility for stagnating developed nations. On February 9, 2009, in warning of the dire consequences facing the United States economy after its housing bubble, U.S. President Barack Obama cited the \"lost decade\" as a prospect the American economy faced. And in 2010, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard warned that the United States was in danger of becoming \"enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years.\"\n\nMore than 25 years after the initial market crash, Japan is still feeling the effects of Lost Decade. However, several Japanese policymakers have attempted reforms to address the malaise in the Japanese economy. After Shinzo Abe was elected as Japanese prime minister in December 2012, Abe introduced a reform program known as Abenomics which sought to address many of the issues raised by Japan's Lost Decade. His \"three arrows\" of reform intend to address Japan's chronically low inflation, decreasing worker productivity relative to other developed nations, and demographic issues raised by an aging population. Investor response to the announced reform was strong, and the Nikkei 225 rallied to 20,000 in May 2015 from a low of around 9,000 in 2008. The Bank of Japan has set a 2% target for consumer-price inflation, although success has been hampered by a sales tax increase enacted to balance the government budget.\n\n\n"}

It will land near the lunar south pole at the Boguslavsky crater. It was renamed from Luna-Glob lander to Luna 25 to emphasize the continuity of the Soviet Luna programme from the 1970s, though it is still part of what was at one point conceptualized as the Luna-Glob lunar exploration program. The launch is scheduled for May 2021.\nNascent plans for what is now Luna 25 began in the late 1990s, with the evaluation of two spacecraft designs having taken place by 1998. Attempts to revive and complete the project continued throughout the 2000s and were punctuated by an aborted attempt at international cooperation via a merger with JAXA's now-cancelled Lunar-A orbiter, and pressure from another attempted cooperative lunar mission with ISRO (which continued without Russia's involvement).\n\nDelays in the 2010s came first from the significant rework and delay brought on by the failure of Phobos-Grunt in 2011. This is the point at which the modern Luna 25 design was developed. Later, work on the lander was slowed by resource pressures being placed upon spacecraft developer NPO Lavochkin, such as the weather satellite Elektro-L No.2 and the Spektr-RG observatory as well the landing platform Russia is contributing to ExoMars 2020.\n\nBy 2017, the propulsion system for the spacecraft was in assembly.\n\nInitial mission plans called for a lander and orbiter, with the latter also deploying impact penetrators. In its current form, Luna 25 is a lander only, with a primary mission of proving out the landing technology. The mission will carry of scientific instruments, including a robotic arm for soil samples and possible drilling hardware.\n\nThe launch is currently planned for May 2021 on a Soyuz-2.1b rocket with Fregat-M upper stage, from Baikonur or Vostochny.\n\n\n"}

It was formerly known as Miss Teen World. The name was changed after the legal issue between Miss World Organization and Miss Teen World organization.\n\nContestants of the pageant include teen girls, with one contestant from each country. The winner is a representative for teen girls around the world.\n\nThe Miss Teen World Pageant was independently produced by Gaspar Cruz and the Miss Teen World Organization now called Miss Teen Continents.\n\nMiss World Limited, the owner of a number of trade mark registrations for the mark MISS WORLD, won a judicial battle against a Teen pageant based in the USA. Among Miss World’s registrations is a United States trade mark for MISS WORLD (no. 877221), which was first registered on 5 April 1968. Therefore, there could never be a “Miss Teen World”, if not organized by the Miss World Organization.\n\nMiss World Limited has extensively used and developed its brand over the past 60 years, which has become a famous and well-respected trademark. Over the years, many new pageants and so-called organizations have tried to take advantage of it (just like it happens with Miss Universe as well), so Miss World Limited has always strongly protected its brand and defended its long-standing exclusive rights to the MISS WORLD name and trade mark.\nAfter a two-year Federal Court lawsuit and trial in the United States, Miss World won it and the pageant formerly known as “Miss Teen World” produced by Gaspar Cruz has no right to use such name any longer.\n\nThe Court found in favor of the Miss World organisation on all its claims of federal trade mark infringement, dilution and unfair competition. Crucially, United States District Judge Vanessa D. Gilmore also found that as a result of Miss World’s continuous usage and promotion, “the MISS WORLD mark has become well-known and famous in the United States and internationally”.\n\nThe Court also went on to find that Mr Cruz’s use of the word “world” as part of his competitions as a trade marked name or as a title for his pageant winners caused actual confusion amongst the public and led to actual contempt of the Court’s earlier injunction.\n\nThe United States litigation highlighted Mr Cruz’s unauthorised international licensing of “Miss Teen World” where third parties are using the “Miss Teen World” name to run branded competitions in their own countries. The Court order enjoined Mr Cruz and all those acting in concert with or behalf of him from a number of activities including using the “Miss Teen World” name or any name which is similar to the MISS WORLD mark or likely to dilute its distinctive quality.\nMiss World Limited takes the protection of its intellectual property and famous brand very seriously and will take any required action against an infringer of its MISS WORLD mark.\nSuch judicial decision should set an example and stop others from stealing intellectual property from Miss Universe, Miss World, or any other pageant.\n\n"}

{"id": "2978208", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2978208", "title": "Rock am Ring and Rock im Park", "text": "Rock am Ring and Rock im Park\n\nThe ' (German for \"Rock at the Ring\") and ' (\"Rock in the Park\") festivals are two simultaneous rock music festivals held annually. While \"Rock am Ring\" takes place at the Nürburgring race track, \"Rock im Park\" takes place at the Zeppelinfeld in Nuremberg.\n\nBoth festivals are usually regarded as one event with a mostly identical lineup for both festivals. All artists perform one day at Nürburgring and another day in Nuremberg during the three-day event. There have been minor exceptions in the past years where an artist would be announced for one of the festivals only. Combined, Rock im Park and Rock am Ring are the largest music festivals held in Germany and one of the largest in the world with a combined attendance of over 150,000 people in 2007, selling out both events in advance for the first time.\n\nRock am Ring was originally planned as a one-time festival on the Nürburgring celebrating the inauguration of a newer, shorter version of the race track in 1985, but due to its commercial success (with 75,000 audience members), it was decided to make the concert an annual event. However, after a dip in attendance for the 1988 event, the festival was put on hiatus for two years. In 1991, the festival returned with a new concept: as well as featuring well-known artists, event organizers present lesser known up-and-coming bands to the public. In 1993, Rock im Park took place for the first time in Vienna. For the 1994 event, Rock im Park moved to the disused Munich-Riem airport, and the following year to Munich's Olympiastadion, where it found a home for the 1995 and 1996 event. 1997 Rock im Park moved to Nuremberg's Frankenstadion where it was held until the venue was unavailable in 2004 because the stadium was being renovated for the 2006 Football World Cup. Since 2004 the venue moved again to the current Zeppellinfeld, where Rock im Park was since held with the exception of the 2006 festival, which was moved to the Luitpoldhain.\n\nThe 2007 festival was used in a science experiment to test the effects of large bodies of people simultaneously jumping. The experiment data was used to calculate the result if the entire Chinese population were to jump in unison. The experiment concluded no significant results would come from the theoretical event.\n\nAfter 29 editions of Rock am Ring, the new owner of the Nürburgring decided that the contract would not be extended.

Her case became notable in Afghanistan and internationally when she was rescued in late 2011. \"The Guardian\" said that the case of Gul \"horrified Afghanistan and prompted a bout of national soul-searching\". Three of her in-laws were found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 10 years in prison, but later freed after an appeals court voided their convictions. American Attorney Kimberley Motley represented Gul in Supreme Court upon hearing of the in-laws release. Gul became the first victim of a crime that was represented by an Attorney for a criminal proceeding. In a landmark decision the Supreme Court, and after the case was decided twice by the Appellate Court, Gul's in-laws, brother and husband who were never originally tried were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. The court also agreed that Gul could sue all parties for civil compensation. Gul is recovering in a women's shelter and says that she had ambitions to become a politician and stop other women suffering as she did.\n\nGul grew up in Badakhshan, a mountainous province in Northern Afghanistan. Following the death of her father she was moved around relatives and eventually lived with her stepbrother when she was aged about 9. Gul would tend cows and sheep and work in an orchard of walnut and apricot trees, and also made dung bricks for fuel. Her presence in her stepbrother's house was apparently resented by his wife, who pressured him to give Gul up for marriage even though she had not reached the legal marriage age of 16. Her stepbrother's wife had been contacted by a 30-year-old man, Ghulam Sakhi, who illegally paid at least $5,000 for her. Gul was illiterate at the time of her marriage.\n\nSakhi took Gul to his parents' home in the northern province of Baghlan. Officials from the Afghan Ministry of Women’s Affairs claimed that Sakhi's family intended to force Gul into prostitution. Sakhi’s first wife had left him after he and his mother had beaten her for not bearing him children. Gul resisted consummating her marriage for weeks.\n\nGul ran away to a neighbour's house, they alerted the police and Sakhi's family. Sakhi was forced by his neighbours and the police to sign a letter promising not to mistreat Gul in the future, and she was taken back by Sakhi. A neighbour later heard screams coming from the house, and the following morning Gul was described as having \"...lost a lot of weight, her hands were covered with bruises and wounds, one of her hands was broken, but her mother-in-law was forcing her to do the laundry”. Sakhi's family later put her in the cellar. In the cellar, her hands and feet were tied with rope, she slept on the floor without a mattress, and was fed bread and water. She was beaten regularly, with most of the beatings coming from the elderly father of her husband. Her nails and clumps of her hair had been pulled out, and chunks of her flesh had been cut out with pliers. She was lying in hay and animal dung at the time of her discovery.\n\nHis father was accused of hitting Gul with \"sticks, biting her chest, inserting hot irons in her ears and vagina, and pulling out two fingernails\". Gul’s uncle and stepbrother attempted unsuccessfully to visit her, and her stepbrother, Mohammed was warned by Sakhi's family over the legality of the marriage.\n\nIn December 2011, six months after the marriage, Gul was discovered by her uncle and stepbrother and two police officers after they called at the house and heard a voice from the cellar. Police arrested three members of Sakhi's family; Gul's mother-in-law, Siyamoi, her daughter Mahkhurd and Amanullah, the father-in-law. Amanullah was found hiding in a burqa and a blanket.\n\nPolice were told by the family that Sakhi was in Helmand, in the Afghan National Army. This was untrue, and the confusion caused by the false claim allowed him time to escape with his brother, Darmak. They remain at large. A special police unit was established to look for Sakhi.\n\nThe President of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai, called for swift justice for Gul. In May 2012, the judge of a district court in Kabul declared Gul's three in-laws guilty, with the judgement broadcast on national television. In court the in-laws justified their behaviour as a result of their paying good money for a girl who was not pretty, who misbehaved and who would neither work as they demanded nor bear them children.\n\nThe in-laws' lawyers were provided by the legal group Da Qanoon Ghushtonky (Demanders of Law), a group financed by international aid. The lawyers argue that due process in Gul's case was negatively affected by the political outcry over her treatment. The lawyers for the in-laws said they denied beating or drugging Gul and confining her in the cellar, and claimed that Gul's wounds were self-inflicted. They also said they had no plans to send her into prostitution, a claim not addressed in the court.\n\nThree people, Gul's mother-in-law, father-in-law, and sister-in-law were subsequently convicted for her attempted murder, and sentenced to 10 years in prison in July 2012. Their convictions were later upheld on appeal.\n\nIn July 2013 Gul's in-laws were released early and their convictions quashed due to a lack of evidence. Gul and her lawyer were not informed of the release of her in-laws and only found out of their release when they enquired after the date for their appeal. Gul's lawyer, Motley said the release was \"...based on the idea that there was no evidence, but the people who would have given evidence didn't know that the hearing was taking place\". The Afghan Supreme Court sent Gul's case back to an appeals court, the supreme court said that the violence suffered by Gul appeared to warrant convictions for assault, not attempted murder. Their decision was shared by the appeals court who voided the convictions and ordered that the three in-laws be freed. In a landmark decision the Supreme Court heard the case after the Appellate Court heard the case twice and ruled that Gul's in-laws, brother and husband who were never originally tried were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison. The court also agreed that Gul could sue all parties for civil compensation.\n\nThe government prosecutor was not present, and the only person in court was the defence lawyer for the accused, even though both are required to be informed under Afghan law. The defendants were released from prison two days later, a process that usually takes up to a month. The process would have involved government prosecutors twice declining to appeal the release of Gul's in-laws, with the involvement of at least three judges and a prosecutor.\n\nAn internet cafe for women was opened in the Afghan capital Kabul on international Women's Day in 2012, and named for Gul. Gul lives in a shelter near Kabul run by Women for Afghan Women. The organisation was founded in 2001 and has seven shelters across Afghanistan.\n\n"}
{"id": "2560048", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2560048", "title": "Sandugo Festival", "text": "Sandugo Festival\n\nThe Sandugo Festival is an annual historical celebration that takes place every year in Tagbilaran City on the island of Bohol in the Philippines. This festival commemorates the Treaty of Friendship between Datu Sikatuna, a chieftain in Bohol, and Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi. This 16th-century peace treaty occurred on March 16, 1565 through a blood compact or \"sandugo\".\n\nThe Sandugo Festival is held every July. The Tagbilaran City Charter Day on July 1 kicks-off the month-long festival with a holy mass, diana, motorcade and program sponsored by the City Government of Tagbilaran. Among the major activities during the month is the Miss Bohol Sandugo Beauty Pageant, and the Sandugo Street Dancing Competition which is usually held on the 3rd or 4th Sunday of July, and organized by the Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc. (BSFI).\n\nIn 2010, the Street Dancing Competition will be held on July 25. The competition is usually participated in by schools, the city and municipal governments, boholano organizations abroad, and even contingents from other provinces. The competition starts at noon at the City Pier, passes through the city's major streets, and culminates at the Pres. Carlos P. Garcia Sports Complex where a Sandugo Re-enactment is held. The final judging of the competition will be held at the Complex where the participants will again perform for the audience. The winners receive thousands of pesos in prizes.\n\nAside from the activities organized by the city and provincial governments and by the BSFI, are other activities sponsored by various private sectors like nightly shows and trade/food fair at the City Pier, product showcase, concerts, medical and surgical missions, and others.\n\nDue to the inadequate support coming from both government and private sectors coupled with the dwindling public interest in the yearly celebration of the Sandugo Festival, the Bohol Sandugo Foundation, Inc. (BSFI) was organized in 1991. Since then, the BSFI has ably spearheaded the celebration of the Sandugo and has made significant efforts in reviving a nationwide interest in the event which has now become a magnetic byword in the tourism industry.\n\nEvery two years, the \"Tigum Bol-anon Sa Tibuok Kalibutan\" (English: A Gathering of Boholanos Around the World) or TBTK is held in unison with the Sandugo Festival. This gathering is organized by the Confederation of Boholanos in the US and Canada or CONBUSAC, which aims to gather Boholanos from all over for a celebration of unity. Among the activities conducted by the TBTK is the Search for Mrs. Bohol International and Miss Bohol International, CONBUSAC Convention, Awarding of Outstanding Boholanos, medical and surgical missions (in cooperation with the BSFI), and others.\n\nThe 2010 theme is \"Sandugo at 22: Onward for Unity and Progress\".

{"id": "400058", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=400058", "title": "Sarah T. Hughes", "text": "Sarah T. Hughes\n\nSarah Tilghman Hughes (August 2, 1896 – April 23, 1985) was an American lawyer and federal judge who served on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. She is best known as the judge who swore in Lyndon B. Johnson as President of the United States on Air Force One after the Kennedy assassination on November 22, 1963. , she is the only woman in United States history to have sworn in a President, a task usually administered by the Chief Justice of the United States. The photo depicting Hughes administering the oath of office to Johnson is widely viewed as the most famous photo ever taken aboard Air Force One.\n\nBorn Sarah Augusta Tilghman in Baltimore, Maryland, she was the daughter of James Cooke and Elizabeth (Haughton) Tilghman. She went to high school at Western Female High School (now Western High School) in Baltimore, where she was elected president of the freshman class. Standing only five feet one-half inch at maturity, she was described by a classmate as \"small but terrible\". Her determined personality extended to the athletic field where she participated in intramural track and field, gymnastics, and basketball. Another instance of Hughes's strong personal discipline was seen in her habit of going to bed by 8 pm and getting up at 4 am, a habit she continued through much of her life. After graduating from Western High School, she attended Goucher College, an all women's college in central Baltimore very close to her home. She participated in athletics at Goucher College, and 'learned to lose without bitterness, to get up and try again, to never feel resentment,' a trait that would serve her well through many years of political victories and defeats. She graduated with an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1917.\n\nAfter graduation from college, Hughes taught science at Salem Academy in Winston-Salem, North Carolina for several years. She then returned to school to the study of law. In 1919 she moved to Washington, D.C. and attended The George Washington University Law School. She attended classes at night and during the day worked as a police officer. As a police officer, Hughes did not carry a gun or wear a police uniform because she worked to prevent crimes among women and girls, patrolling areas where female runaways and prostitutes were normally found. Her job was an expression of the progressive idea of rehabilitation instead of punishment. Hughes later credited this job with instilling in her a sense of commitment and responsibility to women and children. At that time she lived in a tent home near the Potomac River and commuted to the campus by canoe each evening. She graduated with a Bachelor of Laws in 1922.\n\nShe moved to Dallas, Texas in 1922 with her husband, George Ernest Hughes, whom she had met in law school. Her husband quickly found employment after law school, but Sarah faced significant obstacles as a woman during a time in which law firms generally did not regard women as qualified. Eventually, the small firm of Priest, Herndon, and Ledbetter gave her a rent-free space and even referred some cases to her in exchange for her services as a receptionist. As her practice grew and became more successful, she became increasingly active in local women's organizations. She joined the Zonta Club, the Business and Professional Women's Club, the Dallas Women's Political League, the League of Women Voters, YWCA, Dallas College Club, and the American Association of University Women. Hughes served as Chair of the AAUW Committee on the Economic and Legal Status of Women, advocating equal pay jury service for women, and improved status and recognition for women in the Armed Services. She practiced law for eight years in Dallas before becoming involved in politics, first being elected in 1930 to three terms in the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1935, Hughes accepted an appointment as a state judge from Governor James Allred for the Fourteenth District Court in Dallas, becoming the state's first female district judge. In 1936 she was elected to the same post. She was re-elected six more times and remained in that post until 1960.\n\nHughes received a recess appointment from President John F. Kennedy on October 5, 1961, to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, to a new seat authorized by 75 Stat. 80. She was nominated to the same position by President Kennedy on January 15, 1962. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 16, 1962, and received her commission on March 17, 1962. She was the only female judge appointed by President Kennedy, the first female federal judge in Texas and the third female to serve in the federal judiciary. She assumed senior status on August 4, 1975. Her service terminated on April 23, 1985, due to her death.\n\nThe appointment almost did not happen, according to historian Robert Caro, because the Kennedy administration thought Hughes was \"too old\" and they were seeking younger jurists for the lifetime tenure afforded under Article III for federal judgeships. Hughes had been a \"longtime Johnson ally,\" and as Vice President, Johnson had asked Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General of the United States and brother of President John F. Kennedy, \"to nominate Mrs. Hughes\" for the Federal bench, but the United States Justice Department turned him down. Johnson then offered the job to another attorney. However, Hughes was also an ally of the Speaker of the House, Sam Rayburn, who held up a bill important to RFK until Hughes' appointment was announced. Johnson was outraged at the chain of events because it appeared to be an intentional attempt to insult him, and made him look like the \"biggest liar and fool in the history of the State of Texas\". President Kennedy's White House appointments secretary called it a \"terrible mistake\", citing negligence on the part of Kennedy's staff. The story of how Hughes received her appointment made the rounds of Washington, D.C. insiders, including the political gossip columnists Evans and Novak, which hurt Johnson's reputation for political effectiveness. Historian Steven Gillon agrees with Caro's story, although it was not cross-cited.\n\nHughes was concerned over the ineligibility of women in Texas to serve on juries even though they had the right to vote. She and Helen Edmunds Moore coauthored a proposed amendment that would allow women on juries in Texas, but the bill failed and went nowhere. Despite defeat, Hughes became closely identified with this cause and few people were recognized as working harder for this right. Due in to part to Hughes's work, Texas women secured the right to serve on juries in 1954.\n\nTwo years into her tenure as a federal district judge, on November 22, 1963, Hughes was called upon to administer the oath of office to Lyndon B. Johnson after the assassination of President Kennedy. According to an interview with Barefoot Sanders, who was United States Attorney for the Northern District of Texas at the time:\n\nHughes believed that President Johnson chose her to administer the oath of office due to their friendship, and because Johnson was not pleased with other federal judges in Dallas. Because of this, Hughes was the most suitable choice. Sanders and Hughes no doubt believed those rationales, but Johnson had other reasons to choose her, according to Caro: \"He knew who he wanted - and she was in Dallas.\" Citing another historian, Max Holland, Caro noted that the circumstances surrounding Hughes's appointment meant that she \"'personified Johnson's utter powerlessness'\" when he was vice president. The new President ordered his staff, \"'Get Sarah Hughes ... Find her.'\" Hughes was found and driven to Love Field, while Air Force One—and thus the inauguration of the new President—was held up just for her. Caro asserts that Johnson, in his insecurities, chose Hughes to show to the world that he was now powerful. Two other historians (Holland and Gillen) agree with Caro's assessment that Johnson was still upset that he'd not been consulted on Hughes's appointment in the first place, so it was a way to placate his weak ego. On the other hand, Johnson needed to make sure that \"the swearing in take place at the earliest possible moment ... to demonstrate, quickly, continuity and stability to the nation and the world...\" Johnson used the \"few minutes to spare\" while waiting for Hughes to arrive to plead to Kennedy's staffers to stay awhile for the transition. Finally, she arrived, along with the media and Jackie Kennedy; only then the swearing in could take place. Hughes noted that Jackie's \"eyes 'were cast down'\" when Johnson nodded to the judge to start the oath of office.\n\nThroughout her lifetime, Sarah Hughes was known for her speedy and impartial administration. In 1950, she assisted in establishing Dallas's first juvenile detention center.\n\nHughes was involved in multiple court decisions, including \"Roe v. Wade\", \"Shultz v. Brookhaven General Hospital\", and \"Taylor v. Sterrett\". Hughes was a member of the three-judge panel that first heard the case of \"Roe v. Wade\"; the panel's decision was subsequently affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States. In \"Taylor v. Sterrett\", she argued to upgrade prisoner treatment in the Dallas County jail. Hughes noted that \"the Dallas County Jail was very much in need of change. It was in deplorable condition, and [she] think[s], that under [her] jurisdiction, it became one of the best jails in the whole United States.\"\n\nHughes retired from the active federal bench in 1975, though she continued to work as a judge with senior status until 1982. A close friend of Lyndon Johnson and his family, Hughes participated in his inauguration in 1965, took part in the book signing of Lady Bird Johnson's White House memoirs, and participated in the dedication of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. The dress Hughes wore during the swearing in on Air Force One was donated to a wax museum in Grand Prairie, Texas, but it was destroyed in a fire in 1988. In 1982, Hughes suffered a debilitating stroke which confined her to a nursing home in Dallas. She died three years later on April 25, 1985.\n\nThe Sarah T. Hughes Field Politics Center at Hughes' alma mater, Goucher College, founded in the 1950s with a grant from the Maurice and Laura Falk Foundation, is named in her honor. The special collections reading room of the University of North Texas Libraries is also named in her honor.\n\n"}

The two-hour work, sung in English, is in two parts and features a bass, a tenor, a bass-baritone, two sopranos, seven musicians (including a theremin player) and a large male choir. Also audible are clattering typewriters, pigeons (in later life Tesla was deeply affected by the death of a specific white pigeon), Morse code and fragments of Antonín Dvořák's New World Symphony. It also included two Tesla coil as props at its premiere. A warning was issued in the program to audience members who might be wearing \"pace-makers, hearing aides, or any form of electric, magnetic, mechanical or metallic implant or prosthetic device\".\n\nThe full opera was produced in 2003 by IHOS Music Theatre and Opera. It was originally commissioned by the West Australian Opera and developed over three years through two staged \"works in development\". Creator and original Artistic Director of Tasmania's 10 Days on the Island Festival, Robyn Archer, commissioned the full opera to open the festival in 2003. The work, sponsored by the John Holland Group, was staged in a massive shed on Hobart's docks, where the Tesla coils put on a \"spectacular display of electron sparks\". \n\nReviewing the production for the Melbourne \"Age\", David Lander described it as \"gorgeous image-based performance art with a fascinating, brittle score in which dilemmas are ignored in favour of sensuality\". \"Tesla\" was featured on ABC Classic FM's \"New Music Australia\" program and has been cited as far afield as Croatia, where it was noted in a tourist board tribute to the scientist and Croatian Post's web page detailing a stamp to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the inventor's birth.\n\n\n"}

He pleaded guilty to impaired driving and tried to collect from the insurance policy to pay for the damages of his accident.\n\nJustice Charles Dubin, for the court, held that Clendenning could collect from the insurance. Dubin observed that:\nIn modern commercial practice, many standard form printed documents are signed without being read or understood. In many cases the parties seeking to rely upon the terms of the contract know or ought to know that the signature of a party to the contract does not represent the true intention of the signer, and that the party signing is unaware of the stringent and onerous provisions which the standard form contains. Under such circumstances, I am of the opinion that the party seeking to rely on such terms should not be able to do so in the absence of first having taken reasonable measures to draw such terms to the attention of the other party, and, in the absence of such reasonable measures, it is not necessary for the party denying knowledge of such terms to prove either fraud, misrepresentation or non est factum.\nNormally, a customer would have time to consider the whole agreement. But in this particular situation, renters are typically in a rush and do not normally have a chance to read the terms of the agreement. The judge observed that the rental system is designed to be speedy and, therefore, lengthy and onerous terms cannot assumed to be assented to.\n\n"}

Their relationship was kept low-profile, although some Danish media reported the two were dating. On 24 September 2003, it was announced that Frederik's mother, Queen Margrethe II, intended to give her consent to the marriage at the State Council meeting scheduled for 8 October 2003.\n\nFrederik and Mary became officially engaged on 8 October 2003. Frederik presented Mary with an engagement ring featuring an emerald cut diamond and two emerald cut ruby baguettes. Prior to the wedding, Mary, who had previously been a dual citizen of Australia and the United Kingdom, was granted Danish citizenship. She also converted from Presbyterianism to the Lutheran Church of Denmark. The media portrayed Frederik's and Mary's relationship as a modern \"fairytale\" romance between a prince and a commoner.\n\nThe wedding ceremony of Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark, and Mary Donaldson was held on 14 May 2004 in the Copenhagen Cathedral in Copenhagen, Denmark, followed by the wedding festivities at the Fredensborg Palace. Mary's sisters Jane Stephens and Patricia Bailey, and her friend Amber Petty served as bridesmaids, while Frederik's brother Prince Joachim of Denmark was the best man. Mary's nieces Erin and Kate Stephens and Madisson Woods were flower girls, and Frederik's nephew Prince Nikolai of Denmark and first cousin once removed Count Richard von Pfeil und Klein-Ellguth were pageboys.\n\nMary wore a wedding dress created by Danish fashion designer Uffe Frank with a veil first used by Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden, and then by her daughter Ingrid, Queen of Denmark. The veil, made from Irish lace, was later worn by Ingrid's daughters Margrethe, Benedikte and Anne-Marie. Mary's wedding tiara was a gift from Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik.\n\nUpon her marriage, Mary embraced the title of her husband and became the Her Royal Highness Crown Princess of Denmark. Should Frederik eventually ascend to the Danish throne, as expected, Mary would automatically become the Queen consort of Denmark. She was also honoured with the Order of the Elephant, and her father John Donaldson with the grand cross of the Order of the Dannebrog. In accordance with the statutes of the Danish Royal Orders, both of them were granted a personal coat of arms.\n\nOn 29 April 2008, Frederik and Mary were also created the Count and the Countess of Monpezat, which is a title that Frederik inherited from his father Henrik, Prince Consort of Denmark.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
