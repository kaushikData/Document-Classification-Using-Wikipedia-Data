{"id": "272376", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=272376", "title": "Abyssinia Crisis", "text": "Abyssinia Crisis\n\nThe Abyssinia Crisis was a crisis in 1935 originating in what was called the Walwal incident in the then-ongoing conflict between the Kingdom of Italy and the Empire of Ethiopia (then commonly known as \"Abyssinia\" in Europe). The League of Nations ruled against Italy and voted for economic sanctions, but they were not fully applied. Italy ignored the sanctions, quit the League, made special deals with Britain and France and ultimately established control of Ethiopia. The crisis discredited the League and moved Fascist Italy closer to an alliance with Nazi Germany.\n\nBoth Ethiopia and Italy pursued a policy of provocation against each other and Italy prepared for invasion in Ethiopia, described as follows by the League of Nations:\n\nAt places where there is not a single Italian national, a consul establishes himself in an area known as consular territory with a guard of about ninety men, for whom he claims jurisdictional immunity. This is an obvious abuse of consular privileges. The abuse is all the greater that the consul's duties, apart from the supplying of information of a military character, take the form of assembling stocks of arms, which constitute a threat to the peace of the country, whether from the internal or the international point of view.\n\nThe Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between Italian Somaliland and Ethiopia was twenty-one leagues from and parallel to the Benadir coast (approximately ). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the Walwal oasis (also Welwel, Italian: Ual-Ual) in the Ogaden, well beyond the twenty-one league limit. The fort was in a boundary zone between the nations, which was not well defined; today it is about inside Ethiopia.\n\nOn 29 September 1934, Italy and Abyssinia released a joint statement renouncing any aggression against each other.\n\nOn 22 November 1934, a force of 1,000 Ethiopian militia with three \"fitaurari\" (Ethiopian military-political commanders) arrived near Walwal and formally asked the Dubats garrison stationed there (comprising about 60 soldiers) to withdraw from the area. The Somali NCO leading the garrison refused to withdraw and alerted Captain Cimmaruta, commander of the garrison of Uarder, away, to what had happened.\n\nThe next day, in the course of surveying the border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission arrived at Walwal. The commission was confronted by a newly arrived Italian force. The British members of the boundary commission protested, but withdrew to avoid an international incident. The Ethiopian members of the boundary commission, however, stayed at Walwal.\n\nBetween 5 and 7 December, for reasons which have never been clearly determined, there was a skirmish between the garrison of Somalis, who were in Italian service, and a force of armed Ethiopians. According to the Italians, the Ethiopians attacked the Somalis with rifle and machine-gun fire. According to the Ethiopians, the Italians attacked them, supported by two tanks and three aircraft. In the end, approximately 107 Ethiopians and 50 Italians and Somalis were killed.\n\nNeither side did anything to avoid confrontation; the Ethiopians repeatedly menaced the Italian garrison with the threat of an armed attack, while the Italians sent two planes over the Ethiopian camp. One of them fired a short machine gun burst, which no one on the ground noticed, after the pilot saw Captain Cimmaruta in the midst of the Ethiopians and thought he had been taken prisoner by them.\n\nOn 6 December 1934, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia protested Italian aggression at Walwal. On 8 December, Italy demanded an apology for Ethiopian aggression and, on 11 December, followed up this demand with another for financial and strategic compensation.\n\nOn 3 January 1935, Ethiopia appealed to the League of Nations for arbitration of the dispute arising from the Walwal incident. But the league's response was inconclusive. A subsequent analysis by an arbitration committee of the League of Nations absolved both parties of any culpability for what had happened.\n\nShortly after Ethiopia's initial appeal, Minister of Foreign Affairs Pierre Laval of France and Foreign Secretary Samuel Hoare of the United Kingdom met with Italian dictator Benito Mussolini in Rome.\n\nOn 7 January 1935, a meeting between Laval and Mussolini resulted in the \"Franco–Italian Agreement\". This treaty gave Italy parts of French Somaliland (now Djibouti), redefined the official status of Italians in French-held Tunisia, and essentially gave the Italians a free hand in dealing with Ethiopia. In exchange, France hoped for Italian support against Germany.\n\nOn 25 January, five Italian askaris were killed by Ethiopian forces near Walwal.\n\nOn 10 February 1935, Mussolini mobilized two divisions. On 23 February, Mussolini began to send large numbers of troops to Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, which were the Italian colonies that bordered Ethiopia to the northeast and southeast, respectively. There was little international protest in response to this build-up.\n\nOn 8 March, Ethiopia again requested arbitration and noted Italian military build-up. Three days later Italy and Ethiopia agreed on a neutral zone in the Ogaden. On 17 March, in response to continued Italian build-up, Ethiopia again appealed to the league for help. On 22 March, the Italians yielded to pressure from the League of Nations to submit to arbitration on the dispute arising from the Walwal incident, but continued to mobilize its troops in the region. On 11 May, Ethiopia again protested the ongoing Italian mobilization.\n\nBetween 20 and 21 May, the League of Nations held a special session to discuss the crisis in Ethiopia. On 25 May, a league council resolved that it would meet if no fifth arbitrator had been selected by 25 June, or if a settlement was not reached by 25 August. On 19 June, Ethiopia requested neutral observers.\n\nFrom 23 to 24 June, the United Kingdom tried to quell the crisis, sending Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Anthony Eden to try to broker a peace agreement. The attempt was unsuccessful, and it became clear that Mussolini was intent on conquest. On 25 July, the United Kingdom imposed an embargo on arms sales to both Italy and Ethiopia. Many historians believe that the embargo was a response to Italy's decree that it would view arms sales to Ethiopia as an act of unfriendliness toward Italy while other observers believe that the United Kingdom was protecting her economic interests in East Africa. The United Kingdom also cleared its warships from the Mediterranean, allowing Italy further unhindered access to eastern Africa.\n\nOn 25 June, Italian and Ethiopian officials met in the Hague to discuss arbitration. By 9 July, these discussions had fallen apart.\n\nOn 26 July, the league confirmed that no fifth member of the arbitration panel had been selected. On 3 August, the League limited arbitration talks to matters other than the sovereignty of Walwal.\n\nOn 12 August, Ethiopia pleaded for the arms embargo to be lifted. On 16 August, France and the United Kingdom offered Italy large concessions in Ethiopia to try to avert war, but Italy rejected the offers. On 22 August, Britain reaffirmed its commitment to the arms embargo.\n\nOn 4 September, the league met again and exonerated both Italy and Ethiopia of any culpability in the Walwal incident, on the ground that each nation had believed Walwal was within its own territorial borders. On 10 September, Pierre Laval, Anthony Eden, and even Sir Samuel Hoare agreed on limitations to sanctions against Italy.\n\nOn 25 September, Ethiopia again asked for neutral observers.\n\nOn 27 September, the British Parliament supported the initiative of Konni Zilliacus and unanimously authorized the imposition of sanctions against Italy should it continue its policy towards Ethiopia.\n\nOn 28 September, Ethiopia began to mobilize its large but poorly equipped army.\n\nOn November 7, the Irish Free State passed the \"League of Nations Bill\", placing sanctions on Italy.\n\nOn 3 October 1935, shortly after the league exonerated both parties in the Walwal incident, Italian armed forces from Eritrea invaded Ethiopia without a declaration of war, prompting Ethiopia to declare war on Italy, thus beginning the Second Italo–Abyssinian War.\n\nOn 7 October in what would come to be known as the Riddell Incident, the League of Nations declared Italy to be the aggressor, and started the slow process of imposing sanctions on Italy. The sanctions were limited, however. They did not prohibit the provision of several vital materials, such as oil, and were not carried out by all members of the League.\n\nThe United States, generally indifferent to the League of Nations' weak sanctions, increased its exports to Italy, and the United Kingdom and France did not take any serious action against Italy, such as blocking Italian access to the Suez Canal. Even Italy's use of chemical weapons and other actions that violated international norms did little to change the League's passive approach to the situation.\n\nIn late December 1935, Hoare of the United Kingdom and Laval of France proposed the secret Hoare-Laval Plan, which would have ended the war but allowed Italy to control large areas of Ethiopia. Mussolini agreed to the plan, but it caused an outcry in the United Kingdom and France when the plan was leaked to the media. Hoare and Laval were accused of betraying the Abyssinians, and both resigned. Their plan was dropped, but the perception spread that the United Kingdom and France were not serious about the principles of the league. The war continued, and Mussolini turned to German dictator Adolf Hitler for alliance.\n\nIn March 1936, Hitler marched troops into the Rhineland, which had been prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles. The French were now desperate to get Italian support against German aggression directly on their border, so would not take any further action with sanctions. France was prepared to give Abyssinia to Mussolini, so his troops were able to continue their war relatively unchallenged by the rest of Europe.\n\nHaile Selassie was forced into exile on 2 May. All the sanctions that had been put in place by the League were dropped after the Italian capture of the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on the 5th of May 1936. Ethiopia was then merged with the other Italian colonies to become Italian East Africa (\"Africa Orientale Italiana\", or AOI).\n\nEthiopia never officially surrendered, and pleaded for help from foreign nations, such as Haile Selassie's . As a result, there were six nations which did not recognize Italy's occupation in 1937: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States. Italian control of Ethiopia was never total, due to continued guerrilla activity, which the British would later use to their advantage during World War II. However, by 1940 Italy was in complete control of three-quarters of the country.\n\nThe end of the AOI came quickly during World War II. In early 1941, as part of the East African Campaign, Allied forces launched offensive actions against the isolated Italian colony. On 5 May 1941, five years after the Italians had captured his capital, Emperor Haile Selassie entered Addis Ababa.\n\nThere were also major impacts on the League of Nations:\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "55276720", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=55276720", "title": "Blacksmith token", "text": "Blacksmith token\n\nBlacksmith tokens are a form of evasion currency that was in circulation primarily in Lower Canada and Upper Canada along with neighboring areas, such as the northern parts of New York and New England in the mid-1820 to 1830s. They were not, strictly speaking counterfeits, but instead skirted around the laws of the time by being similar to officially circulating coinage, but bearing different legends, or bearing no legends or dates at all, so it could be claimed that they were truly imitating circulating coinage fully. The tokens were designed to resemble worn examples of English or Irish copper coinage, most often with a crude profile of either George II or George III in profile on the obverse and an image of Britannia or an Irish harp on the reverse. They were typically underweight when compared to officially sanctioned halfpenny coinage, but were accepted along with many other unofficially issued tokens due to a lack of sufficient small denomination coinage in circulation at the time.\n\nMost examples were issued in copper, with a few examples struck in brass. Due to the deliberately poor nature of the images carved into the dies for these tokens, it is rare for a Blacksmith token to be graded higher than \"Very Fine\", with most examples falling into a \"Good\" or \"Very Good\" grade. While first mentioned by noted Canadian numismatists Eugene Courteau and R.W. McLachlan, there were first fully described as a separate type of evasion currency by American numismatist Howland Wood with the publication of his pamphlet \"The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers\" in 1910. These coins, along with many other underweight copper tokens, were eventually driven out of circulation by the late 1830s as Canadian banks began to issue officially sanctioned copper tokens of the proper weight for their value.\n\nIt is not known how many of these coins were made, as the creators faced possible prosecution if they were discovered. Evidence from hoards suggest that some of the blacksmith tokens were relatively common, and examples of various Blacksmith coppers have been found during archaeological excavations along with other coinage contemporary to the 1830s in the Saint John River Valley in Nova Scotia, on the grounds of Fort York in Toronto, and Place Royale in Quebec City.\n\nThe more common Blacksmith tokens can be had for about C$20-$30, while the rarer varieties for which only a handful or unique examples are known can command prices in the thousands of dollars.\n\nThe name is derived from reference by R.W. McLachlan in an 1885 article about Canadian Numismatics, where he describes a specific coin of this series and says:\n\n\"Previous to 1837, when the lack of specie caused copper change to be accepted in bulk, there lived in Montreal a blacksmith of dissipated habits. He prepared a die for himself, and when he wished to have a \"good time\" he struck two or three dollars in these coppers, and thereby supplied himself with sufficient change with which to gratify his wishes.\"\n\nWhile this description was intended to describe only a specific coin in the series, \"blacksmith token\" or \"blacksmith copper\" was the name that stuck, and was soon applied to all of these types of coins. While the rarer blacksmith tokens may well have been struck by a single person by hand, the large numbers of some of the more common tokens in this series suggests that some of them came from more professional minting operations. McLachlan stated that the numerous types of blacksmith tokens available and their quantity meant that they were either struck at several different establishments in quantity, or a large number came from one establishment which operated for several years. More recent research points to the blacksmith tokens being created at various locations in Lower Canada, and possibly in Upper Canada and the United States.\n\nIndividual coins in the Blacksmith token series were described by the Canadian numismatist R.W. McLachlan in articles dating back to the mid-1880s, and several examples were also included in Pierre-Napoléon Breton's extensive catalog of Canadian colonial tokens. Numismatist Eugene Courteau was the first to notice design similarities between several of these coins, and documented them in an article published in \"The Numismatist\" in 1908.\nHowland Wood published the first comprehensive study of the series in an article published \"The Numismatist\" in 1910, titled \"The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers\" (published later that same year as a pamphlet of the same name). He noted one characteristic that was common to the series, that they were created specifically to look like worn British half-pence coins. Another common feature to most of the Blacksmith coppers was that their designs were the opposite to that of the original coin being imitated. If the coin was imitating the bust of George III on its obverse, it would face left in the Blacksmith version whereas in the officially issued coinage it would face right. Wood believed that the reason for this was the inexperience of the die cutter, who created the die facing the same way as the original coin being imitated. The reverse of many of these coins featured an image of Britannia who faced the opposite way from the original, though Wood notes that when the reverse featured a harp, it faced the same way as it did on the Irish regal coinage it was imitating. Most of these regal imitations were created using copper, though he notes a few that were done in brass. Though Wood had no conclusive proof, he thought the regal imitation Blacksmith tokens were created in the first quarter of the 19th century, noting a particular specimen that had been struck over a George IV half-penny of 1825, so clearly not struck before that date, and was likely struck sometime soon after that date. This has been further corroborated in more recent times with the discovery of a Blacksmith token that had been struck over an Upper Canadian token dating to 1820.\n\nIn addition to the Blacksmith tokens that imitated English and Irish regal coinage of George II and George III, Wood also pointed out a second series of Blacksmith tokens which he considered to be \"curiosities and puzzles\", consisting of mules that mixed up dies from various store card tokens with other crudely made dies. One of these mules includes dies made for a store card token that was released within the United States in 1835, meaning that the Blacksmith version could not have been issued prior to this date. Given that the banks of Upper and Lower Canada started issuing their own officially sanctioned tokens of the correct weight for their value in 1838, Wood believed this series of tokens must have been created between those dates. Wood also pointed out the relative scarcity of these Blacksmith tokens when compared to those imitating regal coinage, believing that they were issued in limited numbers.\n\nWood counted 46 distinct varieties of Blacksmith tokens. Subsequent research has shown that two of Wood's Blacksmith tokens are in fact worn imitation coppers of British origin, and a third token listed by Wood a copper variant made of brass is in fact made of copper. A study by Oppenheim cataloging the auction of a prominent Blacksmith token collection added several more Blacksmith tokens and variants that were unknown to Wood; the Charlton catalog of Canadian Colonial Tokens lists 56 Blacksmith tokens and varieties. Blacksmith tokens are recognized as falling into specific categories based on the design they were imitating: those containing a regal profile, imitations of the Tiffin plus \"Bust and Harp\" tokens, those with blank reverse, imitations of the \"Ships Colonies and Commerce Tokens\", the \"BITIT\" Series, those based on worn Daniel and Benjamin True token dies, and other miscellaneous types.\n\nResearch continues in this area, the most recent contribution being by John Lorenzo who has done extensive X-ray fluorescence studies of various Blacksmith tokens in order to determine their metal composition. Some of his discoveries including finding that the die axes described for some varieties in existing coin catalogs should be considered approximate, identifying additional sub-varieties to Wood 29 and Wood 38, and suggests that there are at least four major \"families\" of Blacksmiths whose production are linked based on the dies that were used.\n\nThe \"BITIT\" blacksmith tokens (Wood 33) is considered to be the most common of the Blacksmiths series, and one of the most controversial in numismatic literature. The obverse contains the profile of George III with what Wood described as a \"large pug nose\", while the reverse has a seated Britannia holding a shamrock. Unlike most Blacksmith tokens, this coin features a legend on both sides, with the tops of the letters obscured by excessive die polishing, possibly done on purpose.\n\nThere has been considerable interpretation as to the reading of the legend of the token, as the missing top portion of its letters supports different readings. McLachlan interpreted the inscription on the obverse as saying \"GLORIUVS III VIS\", though some numismatists contemporary to McLachlan suggested that the \"VIS\" should instead be read as \"VTS\", which is claimed to be an abbreviated, Latin version for \"Vermont\". McLachlan refuted this claim, saying that he had \"little doubt that this piece was struck and issued in Canada as an imitation of a George III copper\". This argument has been picked up again in more recent numismatic studies, with one article affirming that an example graded as Fine reveals the \"I\" should be read as \"T\", supporting the \"VTS\" reading. An off-center strike of this Blacksmith token in the collection of the Bank of Canada Museum where the top portion of the supposed \"T\" ought to be more visible, but is not, contradicts this reading.\n\nWood thought that the obverse legend read \"GLORIOVS III VIS\". A more recent article claims that several high-grade examples of the coin reveal a weak serif and cross-bar on the \"L\", and that the first \"O\" is thinner than the second, suggesting that the initial word of the legend should be read as \"GEORIUVS\" instead. The legend on the obverse has been interpreted as reading as the nonsensical \"BITIT\", though one study claims that the \"I\" and \"T\" are instead an \"R\" and \"I\", making the word read \"BRITI\" instead, a short form for \"BRITISH\".\n\nIn his comprehensive listing of Blacksmith tokens, Wood included this in his \"Miscellaneous and Doubtful\" series, suggesting that it might be an imitation regal coin created in England, but sharing the common Blacksmith token characteristic of the regal bust facing the opposite way. While McLachlan clearly thought that this coin was issued in Canada and was relatively plentiful, it is notable that it was not included in Breton's \"Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada\", possibly because he thought it was a British import. While American numismatist John H. Hickcox believed the coin to have come from Vermont, the majority consensus of other mid-19th century U.S. Colonial numismatists omit the coin in their listings While the provenance of this coin is still debated, examples of this coin appearing in the hoard McLachlan described and archaeological finds in locations in Upper Canada, Lower Canada and New Brunswick establish that it circulated in Canada.\n\n"}

{"id": "2473207", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2473207", "title": "Cruising (driving)", "text": "Cruising (driving)\n\nCruising is a social activity that primarily consists of driving a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a driver's license. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or \"strip\") is often the focus of cruising. \"Cruise nights\" are evenings during which cars drive slowly. Another common form is a \"Booze Cruise\": this is where a group of people go out 'cruising' and drinking. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.\n\nOne of the oldest cruising strips is located on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among lowriders during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s. Van Nuys Boulevard in the central San Fernando Valley has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film \"Van Nuys Blvd.\" depicted the cruising culture on the strip. Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in Modesto, California. The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the film \"American Graffiti\". The film was set (but not actually filmed) in director George Lucas's home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual \"Graffiti Summer\" celebration in the film's honor.\n\nCruising in Detroit was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac. Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from \"Car and Driver\", \"Motor Trend\", and \"CBS World News Roundup\". The cruising culture on Woodward Avenue faded in the 1970s when new car safety standards and higher gas prices altered American automotive design. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people and 40,000 muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles.\n\nCruising in the southwestern Minneapolis suburb of Hopkins, Minnesota, was so popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s that people from all over the state of Minnesota traveled there to show off their cars. It became such a phenomenon that a local TV station went there and did a piece for a locally produced news program, \"Twin Cities Today\".\n\nThe Dragging the Gut Festival is held each year on the fourth weekend of August (August 23–24, 2013) in the historic downtown of McMinnville, Oregon. The festival gives participants the chance to relive the classic 1950s car cruising on the main street that took place for decades in downtown McMinnville. The Dragging the Gut Festival was born out of a Facebook group called \"I Dragged the Gut in Downtown McMinnville\" which grew rapidly and led to the creation of the festival.\n\nWaukegan, Illinois, has an annual summer cruising festival called \"Scoopin' Genesee\".\n\nIn the 2000s, some cities (such as Milwaukee, Wisconsin) began to consider cruising a traffic offense.\n\nCruises such as the one on International Drive in Orlando, Florida, from the early 1990s, were broken-up by city ordinance signs that stated what hours drivers could and could not turn around throughout the strip, which kept cruisers from turning around in u-turn areas during specific times at night or cruisers would be ticketed. Cruisers had to go to a light in order to turn around. Many cruisers saw this as a hassle and stopped going. Local businesses enforced the signs, but paid the price in the long run, because cruisers would purchase goods, food and entertainment from many of the shops, attractions and restaurants set up along the drive. Some of the businesses in and around the area have closed down since the ban, due to poor sales afterwards.\n\nThere are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises. The events that take place are similar; cars meet in car parks, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise – often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, burnouts, and doughnuts.\n\nA meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.\n\nA one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites. The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police. until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.\n\nOne-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance. This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.\n\nSome large cruises operate a \"convoy-only\" policy.\n\nCruises are generally held in retail parks due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as McDonald's or Burger King.\n\nAlthough cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are breach of the peace, caused by loud exhausts and sound systems disturbing local residents and dangerous driving (such as street racing, burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars. More recently, police have been using ASBO laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.\n\nAs a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as Weston Wheels, although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls. This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.\n\nMany city councils have successfully placed court injunctions to prevent boy racers parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.\n\nCruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines Max Power, Fast Car and Redline. In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene – preferring to concentrate on \"dream\" cars such as Nissan Skylines. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25029023", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25029023", "title": "Dirty War (Mexico)", "text": "Dirty War (Mexico)\n\nThe Mexican Dirty War () refers to the Mexican theater of the Cold War, an internal conflict between the Mexican PRI-ruled government, backed by the US, and left-wing student and guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s under the presidencies of Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, Luis Echeverría and José López Portillo. During the war, government forces carried out disappearances, estimated at 1,200, systematic torture, and \"probable extrajudicial executions\".\n\nThe judicial investigation into State crimes against political movements was opened only until Vicente Fox's term (2000-2006), which created the Special Prosecutor's Office for Social and Political Movements of the Past (FEMOSPP). However, despite the fact that it has advanced in the knowledge of the historical facts, the FEMOSPP has not been able to finalize concrete legal ramifications against the main instigators of the dirty war.\n\nThe war was characterized by a backlash against the active student movement of the late 1960s which terminated in the Tlatelolco massacre at a 1968 student rally in Mexico City, in which 30 to 300 (official report, non-governmental sources claim thousands) students were killed, and by the Corpus Christi massacre, a massacre of student demonstrators in Mexico City on June 10, 1971.\n\nThere were several barely connected groups fighting against the government during this period. Among the most important, the September 23 Communist League was at the forefront of the conflict, active in several cities throughout Mexico, drawing heavily from Christian Socialist and Marxist student organizations. They carried out confrontations with Mexican security forces, several kidnappings, and attempted to kidnap Margarita López Portillo, the sister of the president. In Guerrero, the Party of the Poor, ostensibly fighting against landholder impunity and oppressive police practices in rural areas, was led by the ex-teacher Lucio Cabañas; they carried out ambushes of the army and security forces and the abduction of Guerrero's governor-elect.\n\nThe legalization of left-wing political parties in 1978 along with the amnesty of imprisoned and at large guerrillas caused a number of combatants to end militant struggle against the government. However, certain groups continued fighting, and the National Human Rights Commission states the hostilities continued into 1982.\n\nIn June 2002, a report prepared for Vicente Fox, the first president not from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 70 years, detailed the government's actions from 1964 to 1982. The report states, according to BBC News, that the Mexican army \"kidnapped, tortured, and killed hundreds of rebel suspects\" in the period and accused the Mexican state of genocide. The Mexican Special Prosecutor claimed the report was overly biased against the military, and failed to detail crimes committed by rebels, which included kidnappings, bank robberies, and assassinations. However, there is a general consensus that the government's actions was blameworthy. Instead of ensuring the security of innocent civilians, it victimized them and killed them alike.\n\nThe year 1960 marked the beginning of a decade of terror in the region of Guerrero as the state slowly began to deal with the citizens and peasants there ever-more violently. The state enacted the acts of suppression on Guerrero to keep the numerous different political reform movements stifled, as the local people over time grew agitated with the way the government was wielding their power and meddling with their rights. As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the PRI continued to increase their terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under their control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the PRI. The rising of guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s provided the state an excuse to focus their resources on suppressing the armed activities of the guerrillas. The army would become infamous for their tactics in repressing the rebels in the rural areas of Mexico, where such practices such as the death flights were initiated. This period of state violence in the state of Guerrero helped to bring about numerous guerrilla organizations. One of the groups was the Party of the Poor (PDLP), which was influenced by Marxism and people like Che Guevara. That group tended to be focused more on the rural regions like Guerrero, where they would be more likely to find support among the peasants there. PDLP actions become more violent towards the rich after events such as the 1967 Atoyac massacre, where leaders like Lucio Cabanas tried to use the peasants anger to bring about true revolution. As the 1960s and 1970s would go on, the PDLP would gain attention around the nation for acts like their kidnapping of Ruben Figueroa who was a prominent member of the PRI. While this act inspired those downtrodden by the government, this also marked the decline of the organization as the government began to focus more on taking out this guerrilla group. Eventually the army found and killed Cabanas on December 2, 1974 in an attempt to cause his movement to fall apart. Another school teacher turned revolutionary, Genaro Vazquez, founded the National Revolutionary Civic Association (ACNR) as a response to the governments actions in Guerrero. These two leaders and their movements emerged as the armed phase of this social struggle against a corrupt government, which would continue long after the deaths of the leaders.\n\nTorture was one of the many tools used by the PRI-run state in its drive to keep the numerous guerrilla groups and political dissidents repressed. While torture is illegal in many countries during this time, the numerous authoritarian regimes that sprung up from the Cold War used it to great effect. The Mexican state used torture to get information from captured rebels and guerrillas about attacks and plans. This torturing would be down at any number of clandestine detention centers, where guerrillas would be sent to before arriving at a legal prison so as the state's activities would be kept secret from outside sources. Typically both male and female guerrilla prisoners would be tortured at these areas, it was more common for women to be sexually assaulted by their guards. This, combined with other forms of physical and psychological gender-based transgressions leads some to believe that the state employed this form of gender policing to try and deter women from breaking the regimes social and political norms. The detaining and torturing of political prisoners became more systematic after the student uprisings in 1968, for the government decided that heavy-handed responses were necessary to deal with the unrest. This stage of violent and public repression of differing ideals was similar to the regimes of the Southern Cone governments, such as Argentina.\n\nWhile Mexico's Dirty War has been over for several years, not much is known of the extent of the number of victims the war claimed, due to its elusive nature throughout its length. Part of the reason for this problem is that since there was no large-scale truth commission to bring justice to the perpetrators and closure for the victim's families, Mexico never had its \"Pinochet moment\" in regards to the war. Another problem was the lack of response in the wake of the 2006 report by Carillo Prieto, which documented some of the atrocities inflicted by the PRI regime. Despite this evidence of numerous crimes that violated human rights, ex-president Echeverria and several other PRI officials had their cases dismissed and became free men. The failure by the government to address these problems of the past has been a cause of tension at times in Mexico, as citizens become untrusting of a state that does not address the old regime and its reign of terror.\n\n"}

{"id": "2602504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2602504", "title": "Eight Miles High", "text": "Eight Miles High\n\n\"Eight Miles High\" is a song by the American rock band the Byrds, written by Gene Clark, Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (\"see\" 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \"Eight Miles High\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \"Why\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \"Eight Miles High\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era.\n\nThe song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the \"Gavin Report\" regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. The band strenuously denied these allegations at the time, but in later years both Clark and Crosby admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their own drug use. The failure of \"Eight Miles High\" to reach the \"Billboard\" Top 10 is usually attributed to the broadcasting ban, but some commentators have suggested that the song's complexity and uncommercial nature were greater factors.\n\n\"Eight Miles High\" reached number 14 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart and number 24 in the UK Singles Chart. The song was also included on the band's third album, \"Fifth Dimension\", which was released on July 18, 1966. \"Eight Miles High\" became the Byrds' third and final U.S. Top 20 hit, and was also their last release before the departure of Gene Clark, the band's principal songwriter at the time.\n\nThe song's lyrics are, for the most part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their accompanying English tour, as hinted at by the opening couplet: \"Eight miles high and when you touch down, you'll find that it's stranger than known.\" Although commercial airliners fly at an altitude of six to seven miles, it was felt that \"eight miles high\" sounded more poetic than six and also recalled the title of the Beatles' song \"Eight Days a Week\".\n\nAccording to Clark, the lyrics were primarily his creation, with a minor contribution being Crosby's line, \"Rain grey town, known for its sound\"—a reference to London as home to the British Invasion, which was then dominating the U.S. music charts. Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: \"Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground\", which is a reference to the hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group the Birds serving the band with a copyright infringement writ, due to the similarities in name. In addition, \"Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms\" describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line \"Sidewalk scenes and black limousines\" refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars.\n\nAlthough the basic idea for the song had been discussed during the band's flight to England, it didn't actually begin to take shape until the Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S. To alleviate the boredom of traveling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along cassette recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums \"Impressions\" and \"Africa/Brass\", which were on constant rotation on the tour bus. The influence of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of \"Eight Miles High\" and its B-side \"Why\".\n\nClark began writing the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he scribbled down some rough ideas for later development, following a discussion with guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that it was he who conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, \"Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark\", author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.\n\nThe master recording of \"Eight Miles High\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. John Einarson has commented that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \"India\" from the \"Impressions\" album, can be clearly heard in \"Eight Miles High\"—most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies.\n\n\"Eight Miles High\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the \"Fifth Dimension\" album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \"feel like a plane landing.\"\n\nAn earlier version of \"Eight Miles High\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio. McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\" This original version of \"Eight Miles High\" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album \"Never Before\" and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of \"Fifth Dimension\".\n\n\"Eight Miles High\" was released on March 14, 1966 in the U.S. and May 29, 1966 in the UK, reaching number 14 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and number 24 on the UK Singles Chart. Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from \"Bill Gavin's Record Report\", a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. This resulted in \"Eight Miles High\" being banned in a number of states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the \"Billboard\" Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating \"Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it.\" Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that \"it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do.\"\n\nResearch analyst Mark Teehan, writing for Popular Musicology Online, has challenged the widely held view among critics, music historians and the Byrds themselves that the U.S. radio ban hurt sales of \"Eight Miles High\". Having examined the local music surveys and the \"Billboard\" regional retail sales charts, as they relate to the national charting of \"Eight Miles High\", Teehan has uncovered evidence suggesting that the progressive and uncommercial nature of the song was a much bigger factor in its failure to reach the \"Billboard\" Top 10. The author's research revealed that \"Eight Miles High\" failed to reach the Top Five in any of his sample of 23 regional markets, and most telling, among the thirty radio stations included within this sample, it reached the Top 10 on only seven of them (23%). \n\nTeehan points out that although the \"Gavin Report\" recommended that radio stations withdraw the single from airplay, many stations did not comply with this request. In addition, Teehan notes that the radio ban was not suggested by the \"Gavin Report\" until April 29, 1966, almost seven weeks after the single had initially been released—ample time for it to have made its mark on the charts. Teehan has uncovered evidence showing that \"Eight Miles High\" was already decelerating on the national charts before the end of April 1966. He concludes that the groundbreaking song lacked strong commercial appeal by virtue of its complexity, unique sound, and excessive length (commercial radio stations were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long during the mid-1960s), and that it suffered from uncoordinated and inefficient promotion by Columbia Records.\n\nThe song's use of Indian and free-form jazz influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock. Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, Domenic Priore, and Dwight Rounds, have described \"Eight Miles High\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song. In his book \"Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood\", Priore cites \"Eight Miles High\" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining \"prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar.\"\n\nThe song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre raga rock, when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for \"The Village Voice\", used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music. However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term \"raga rock\" in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the \"Eight Miles High\" single release. In a 1968 interview for the Pop Chronicles radio documentary, McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock, while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating \"they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit.\" Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with the Yardbirds, the Beatles, Donovan and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.\n\nContemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with \"Billboard\" magazine describing the song as a \"Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing.\" \"Record World\" magazine also praised the song, commenting \"It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights.\" In the UK, \"Music Echo\" described the song as \"wild and oriental but still beaty\". The publication also suggested that with the release of \"Eight Miles High\" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating \"[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single.\" In recent years, Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, has described \"Eight Miles High\" as \"one of the greatest singles of the '60s.\"\n\nIn 1999, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, an honor reserved for \"recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old.\" In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" magazine ranked \"Eight Miles High\" at number 151 on their list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" and in March 2005, \"Q\" magazine placed the song at number 50 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Guitar Tracks\".\n\nDuring the same month that \"Eight Miles High\" was released as a single, the Byrds' main songwriter, Gene Clark, left the band. His fear of flying was stated as the official reason for his departure, but other factors, including his tendency toward anxiety and paranoia, as well as his increasing isolation within the group, were also at work. Following the release of \"Eight Miles High\" and Clark's departure, the Byrds never again managed to place a single in the \"Billboard\" Top 20.\n\nThe Byrds performed \"Eight Miles High\" on a number of television programs during the 1960s and 1970s, including \"Popside\", \"Drop In\", \"Midweek\", and \"Beat-Club\". The song would go on to become a staple of the band's live concert repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973. A sixteen-minute live version of \"Eight Miles High\" was included on the Byrds' \"(Untitled)\" album in 1970, and another live version was released as part of the 2008 album, \"Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971\". The song was performed live by a reformed lineup of the Byrds featuring Roger McGuinn, David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989.\n\nThe song would remain a favorite of Clark's during his post-Byrds solo career and would often be performed live at his concert appearances until his death, in 1991. McGuinn also continues to perform an intricate acoustic guitar rendition of the song in his live concerts. Crosby has revisited \"Eight Miles High\" infrequently during his post-Byrds career, but it was performed during Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young's reunion tour of 2000, with Neil Young handling McGuinn's guitar solo, while the other three members sang the song's three-part harmonies. Additionally, the Byrds' bass player, Chris Hillman, recorded an acoustic version of \"Eight Miles High\" as part of his 2005 album, \"The Other Side\". \n\nIn addition to its appearance on the \"Fifth Dimension\" album, \"Eight Miles High\" also appears on several Byrds' compilations, including \"The Byrds' Greatest Hits\", \"History of The Byrds\", \"\", \"The Byrds\", \"The Very Best of The Byrds\", \"The Essential Byrds\" and \"There Is a Season\".\n\n\"Eight Miles High\" has been covered by many different bands and artists including the Ventures, Leathercoated Minds, East of Eden, Lighthouse, Leo Kottke, Roxy Music, Ride, Stewart/Gaskin, Robyn Hitchcock, Rockfour, Les Fradkin, The Kennedys, the Postmarks and Steve Hunter. In addition, Hüsker Dü released the song as a single prior to the release of their \"Zen Arcade\" LP in 1984. The song was also covered in 1969 by Golden Earring, who put a nineteen-minute version on their \"Eight Miles High\" album.

{"id": "1135808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1135808", "title": "Galileo Galilei (opera)", "text": "Galileo Galilei (opera)\n\nGalileo Galilei is an opera based on excerpts from the life of Galileo Galilei which premiered in 2002 at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, as well as subsequent presentations at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's New Wave Music Festival and London's Barbican Theatre. Music by Philip Glass, libretto and original direction by Mary Zimmerman and Arnold Weinstein. The piece is presented in one act consisting of ten scenes without break.\n\n\"Galileo Galilei\" is Glass' 18th opera, and draws from letters of Galileo and his family, and various other documents, to retrospectively journey through Galileo's life. Opening with him as an old, blind man after the trial and Inquisition for his heresy, it explores his religiosity as well as his break with the church, and expands into the greater, oscillating relationship of science to both religion and art. It reaches its end with Galileo — as a young boy — watching an opera composed by his father, Vincenzo Galilei, who was a member of the Florentine Camerata, an association of artists who are credited with creating the art form that came to be known as opera. Ironically, his father's opera is about the motions of the celestial bodies.\n\nThe opera has been revived with new productions in 2012 by Madison Opera and Portland Opera. The Portland Opera production was recorded by Orange Mountain Music.\n\nAll genius meets with extreme resistance before it is accepted as truth. In the case of Galileo, it was the mere hypothesis that the earth revolved around the sun. The notion was considered heretical and blasphemous by scholars and clergy alike. Much was done to destroy Galileo's reputation. And since they could not do so through scientific proof, they did so through slander and threats of torture. It was not until recently that the Catholic Church finally admitted that they were wrong in persecuting Galileo. It took hundreds of years for them to admit the mistake. Galileo died believing that all of the advancements he had made in science were for naught. His books were banned, and his name was disgraced. All of this, for suggesting a theory that turned out to be true.\n\nIn addition to depicting Galileo's trials before the Inquisition, the opera also allows us a glance into Galileo's more personal side. Namely, in showing us his relationship to his daughter Maria Celeste, who was a nun. Maria Celeste shared her father's love of learning and science, but also understood that he was a man of great faith. She recognized that science was the very subject that served to deepen his faith, and she encouraged him on this path. The two met rarely. They were separated not only by distance, but by Galileo's often ailing health. Sadly, they were ultimately separated by her death at the age of 33, a source of incredible sadness for Galileo. However, their connection in this opera serves to give his story a more personal rendering. The story itself is told backwards through time. It begins with an aged Galileo, blinded from having looked at the sun too often and ends with him as a child. This is related to his invention of the telescope, which works by reversing images with lenses. Much of the staging in this production is representative of Galileo's theories and follows the patterns of the discoveries, planets, and constellations that his inventions made known to the world.\n\n\"Opening Song\"\n\nIn the final days of his life, the now blind Galileo Galilei remembers the things in his life that he can no longer see.\n\n\"Recantation\"\n\nThe officials of the Catholic Church rebuke the scientist for not relenting on his theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The Pope hands down his sentence, and then reminds Galileo of a time when they walked in the garden as friends.\n\n\"Pears\"\n\nMarie Celeste, the daughter of Galileo, sends her intense devotion love and support through letters that are accompanied by elements of her garden at the convent.\n\n\"Trial\"\n\nGalileo is summoned before two Cardinals of the Catholic Church to answer questions regarding his book \"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World\".\n\n\"Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World\"\n\nAs Galileo pens his book, the fictitious characters come alive to discuss the theories presented. \"Here, the Older Galileo becomes the Younger Galileo.\"\n\n\"Incline Plane\"\n\nThe theories and experiments are put to the test in Galileo's laboratory.\n\n\"A Walk in the Garden\"\n\nGalileo and his great friend Cardinal Barberini discuss Galileo's newest book in the Garden. After the Cardinal's feeble attempt at poetry, Galileo expresses his fear of his enemies. Barberini warns Galileo not to continue with his theories regarding the planets.\n\n\"Lamps\"\n\nWhile at mass with his daughter, Galileo observes the swinging of a lamp suspended from the ceiling moving in pendulum fashion and explains his theory to Marie.\n\n\"Presentation of the Telescope\"\n\nGalileo presents his invention to the Duchess and her Ladies in Waiting. The Duchess and Galileo reminisce about a time in their youth when they watched an opera together composed by Galileo's father, Vincenzo.\n\n\"Opera within the Opera\"\n\nThe Duchess and Galileo, now children, are in the audience as his father's opera is performed. The magical story of the planetary figures becomes the vehicle through which Galileo is reunited with his deceased daughter.\n\n"}

The case made Canadian and international headlines.\n\n\"Hall v Durham Catholic School Board\" began when Oshawa, Ontario's Monsignor John Pereyma Catholic Secondary School asked students attending the prom to submit the names of the guests they intended to bring. Hall, who is gay, submitted the name of his 21-year-old boyfriend, Jean-Paul Dumond, and was denied on the grounds that homosexuality is incompatible with Roman Catholic teaching.\n\nSupported by his family and a wide variety of community organizations, Hall thus took the school board to court in a two-day hearing that began on May 6, 2002. Hall's lawyer, David Corbett, argued that the denial of his request violated the Ontario Education Act, which requires school boards in the province not to discriminate. The school board, on the other hand, argued that court interference in its decision would amount to denying its religious freedom.\n\nCorbett argued that an organization that accepts public funding (Catholic school boards in Ontario are fully funded in the same manner as public schools) has to be accountable to the same laws (including anti-discrimination laws) as other public institutions. The school board's lawyer countered that Section 93 of the Canadian constitution protects the Catholic board's rights to conduct its affairs in accordance with Catholic teaching.\n\nIn addition, Corbett noted that while extramarital sex is also contrary to Catholic teaching, the school board had previously allowed pregnant, unmarried students to attend the prom.\n\nOn May 10, Justice Robert McKinnon granted an interlocutory injunction ordering that Hall be allowed to attend the prom with Dumond. The justice also ordered that the school not cancel the prom. He did not decide on the larger issues raised by the case, leaving those to be heard at a later trial. Hall attended the prom with Dumond that evening.\n\nDirector Larry Peloso created a one-hour documentary on the case entitled \"\". An unrelated television movie, \"\", aired on CTV in 2004 with Aaron Ashmore starring as Hall.\n\nHall also appeared in the \"Queer as Folk\" season 2 finale as a party guest during the Rage party at Babylon.\n\nThe case was adapted into a theatrical musical entitled \"Prom Queen,\" with songs by Colleen Dauncey and Akiva Romer-Segal.\n\nAuthor Robert Joseph Greene referenced the court case in his book \"This High School Has Closets\", where Marc Hall is seen as a hero to the main character.\n\n\n"}

The evacuation was completed by June 8.\n\nThe evacuation was prompted by the \"Wehrmacht\"s assault on Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and France in the spring of 1940, which reduced the relative importance of Germany's iron ore provision and of Scandinavia. Several nights after the final military evacuation, the civilians of the town were rescued by British Sub-Lieutenant Patrick Dalzel-Job. Against orders, he organised local fishing boats to remove the population just before a German reprisal bombing. Much of the town was destroyed but only four people were killed. The Royal Navy wanted to discipline Dalzel-Job but was unable to, after King Haakon VII awarded him the Knights Cross of the Order of Saint Olav (First Class). Later in the war, he served with Ian Fleming. Many sources cite Dalzel-Job as the inspiration for the James Bond character.\n\nA consequence of the evacuation of Allied troops from Norway was that Sweden's and Finland's position vis-à-vis Nazi-Germany was weakened. An agreement was reached in June leading to extensive transfers of (unarmed) Wehrmacht troops on Swedish railways – probably Sweden's chief digression from her policy of neutrality between the parties of the war – and in August Finland concluded a secret agreement according to which Finland could acquire weapons through Germany and Germany could transfer (armed) troops by truck through northernmost Finland. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, still united by the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, had excluded other international powers from influence in Northern Europe.\n\n"}

Built in 1878 seating 2,800, it later became a sex cinema. It is now a pub.\n\nThe building is located near Cardiff Central railway station, near the corner of St Mary Street and Wood Street, with entrances and façades on both streets.\n\nThe theatre was built in 1878 to a Venetian Gothic design by the architects W. D. Bleasley and T. Waring, during a period of rapid expansion of Cardiff, then a prosperous coal-exporting port. The building was a prompt replacement of Cardiff's old Theatre Royal in Queen Street (built 1827, which had burnt down in December) doubling the audience capacity to almost 2000, and was opened on 7 October 1878. The main stage was 56 feet wide and 46 feet deep, framed by a 30 feet high proscenium arch topped with the royal coat of arms. Interior decoration was in gold and white and the building was illuminated after dark using 800 gas lamps.\n\nThe theatre was later rebuilt in the Greek Revival style to a design by Willmott & Smith. An additional entrance on St Mary Street was added with two large fluted Doric columns flanking a neoclassical statue of a young woman holding a cup. The interior of the theatre was remodelled in 1920 in the same Greek style. The proscenium arch is flanked by massive Ionic columns carrying a large triangular pediment with an elaborate Grecian bas-relief frieze above.\n\nIn 1988 the interior was divided into multiple spaces for a variety of uses, including an amusement arcade and a pub. This largely obscured the original interior. The interior was again altered in 1999, converting the entire space into a pub and partly restoring the 1920 interior.\n\nThe building was designated a Grade II listed building in 1960.\n\n\nIn 1970 the Welsh Theatre Company was planning to move to the theatre, but this was abandoned.\n\nThe opening production in 1878 was \"Pygmalion and Galatea\" by W. S. Gilbert.\n\nThe Welsh National Opera company's opening performance was at the theatre in 1946, when Cavalleria Rusticana was performed. The Welsh tenor Robert Tear, then a schoolboy, started his career in this performance.\n\nSeveral stars appeared in person at the theatre, including:\n\nBinkie Beaumont (1908–1973) was appointed assistant manager of the theatre at the age of 16.

The majority of rapes have been carried out by the Sudanese government forces and the Janjaweed (\"evil men on horseback\") paramilitary groups. The actions of the Janjaweed have been described as genocidal rape, with not just women, but children also being raped, as well as babies being bludgeoned to death and the sexual mutilation of victims being commonplace.\n\nThe genocide, which is being carried out against the Fur, Masalit and the Zaghawa ethnic peoples has led to the International Criminal Court (ICC) indicting several people for crimes against humanity, rape, forced transfer and torture. According to Eric Reeves more than one million children have been \"killed, raped, wounded, displaced, traumatized, or endured the loss of parents and families\".\n\nDue to the ongoing violence it has not been possible for researchers to conduct population based studies, and there are no estimates as yet of the number of victims. It is believed that the rapes are widespread, and the victims are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. One NGO documented 9,300 rapes, however observers in country have stated the number of those raped are closer to double the 9,300 documented. There have been reports of girls under the age of ten to women over seventy being raped, and that the majority of victims had suffered from being gang raped. Children aged five have been raped, and one third of rape victims are children. As of 2009, reports and testimonials concluded that the campaign of rape was systematic and had been ongoing for five years. In a statement to the UN former secretary general Kofi Annan said “In Darfur, we see whole populations displaced, and their homes destroyed, while rape is used as a deliberate strategy.”\n\nThe United States Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that in a remote area of Darfur local leaders had stated that over four hundred women and girls had been raped, and that some of these women had been raped in full view of their husbands. USAID also reported that they had gotten reports of women being branded by the Janjaweed following rapes.\n\nWriting in \"Foreign Affairs\", American political scientist Scott Straus stated that a U.S. official had reported that 574 villages had been razed and another 157 damaged between the middle of 2003 and September 2004, with most of these villages having no armed rebel presence when the attacks occurred. Depositions by survivors consistently indicate that the militias target men for execution, and that the elderly, women and children are not spared. For women rape is the primary threat. Between the middle of October 2004 and February 2005 it was estimated that up to six million Darfurians were displaced and a further 200,000 had sought asylum in Chad.\n\nIn 2004, the U.S. State Department released a report on the atrocities which ran to eight pages. The report stated that there was \"a consistent and widespread pattern of atrocities in the Darfur region of western Sudan\" and that there was a clear \"pattern of abuse against members of Darfur's non-Arab communities, including murder, rape, beatings, ethnic humiliation, and destruction of property and basic necessities.\" The report also suggested the number of rapes were more than likely underestimated, as acknowledging that a female member of the family had been raped leads to social stigma. In the \"New York Times\", an unnamed observer of the situation was quoted as saying: \"In this society if you rape one woman, you have raped the entire tribe.\"\n\nOn 7 March 2005, Médecins Sans Frontières issued a report which stated that they had treated five hundred rape victims, both women and girls, and that this was but a fraction of those who have been assaulted sexually.\n\nIn 2007 the NGO, Global Grassroots in association with Gretchen Steidle Wallace produced the documentary, The Devil Came on Horseback. Based on the book of the same title which was written by Brian Steidle after his experiences in Darfur it was nominated for an emmy award. In 2009 the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum hosted a documentary film on the sexual violence in Darfur. Nicholas Kristof has traveled to Darfur five times over a period of two years. His accounts of the ongoing violence has played a major role in raising awareness of the situation in Darfur, and has helped to mobilize grassroots campaigns against the violence. In February 2005, he published photographs he had received from the African Union peacekeeping troops, One was of a male child killed by the Janjaweed, his mother laying dead alongside of him. Another was the body of an adult male who had an injured leg, and had been unable to escape. The final was a skeleton of a male or female, hands bound, the clothing had been pulled down around the knees, so the person could have been assaulted sexually before being murdered. In 2014 Kristof wrote “Noura is one of thousands of women and girls to be gang-raped in Darfur, as part of what appears to be a deliberate Sudanese government policy to break the spirit of several African tribes through mass rape.”\n\nLuis Moreno-Ocampo, prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC), having filed charges for crimes against humanity, is also pursuing in his application the charge of genocidal rape as such actions can be tried before the ICC as stand-alone crimes.\n\nOn 27 April 2007 the chamber issued an arrest warrant for Ahmed Haroun on charges of crimes against humanity. Moreno-Ocampo, prosecutor for the ICC accused Haroun, who was Minister of State at the time of the crimes, of arming and recruiting for the Janjaweed, with the sole purpose being the suppression of rebel attacks. Moreno-Ocampo has asserted that Haroun was \"present as arms were distributed to fighters, had full knowledge of atrocities including rape and murder happening on the ground, and incited militias to slaughter civilians in speeches.\"\n\nOn 4 June 2007, the ICC issued a warrant for the arrest of Ali Mohamed Ali, AKA: Ali Koship, Ali Kushayb, Ali Kosheib, Ali Kouchib, Ali Kosheb, Ali Koshib) on over forty charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Allegations against him include, but are not limited to mass murder, forced displacements and rape.\n\nOn 4 March 2009 Sudanese president Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir was indicted by the ICC on five counts of crimes against humanity (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, rape) and two counts of war crimes (direct attacks on civilians and pillaging). He is the first sitting head of state to have been indicted for crimes against humanity. A second warrant was issued for his arrest on 12 July 2010, as the Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC believed there were reasonable grounds that al-Bashir was culpable on three counts of genocide which had been carried out on the Fur, Masalit and the Zaghawa ethnic peoples.\n\n"}

Local tourists would drive along his road in hopes of meeting The Green Man or Charlie No-Face. They passed on tales about him to their children and grandchildren, and people raised on these tales are sometimes surprised to discover that he was a real person who was liked by his family and neighbors.\n\nRobinson was nine years old when he was injured by an electrical line as he climbed a pole and reached for a bird's nest on the Morado Bridge, outside of Beaver Falls. The bridge carried a trolley and had electrical lines of both 1,200 V and 22,000 V, which had killed another boy less than a year earlier. Robinson survived, defying doctors' expectations, but he was severely disfigured: he lost his eyes, nose, and right arm.\n\nRobinson lived in Koppel and spent his days at home with relatives, making doormats, wallets, and belts to sell. Because of his appearance, he rarely ventured out during the day. However, at night, he went for long walks on a quiet stretch of State Route 351, feeling his way along with a walking stick. Groups of locals regularly gathered to search for him walking along the road. Robinson usually hid from his curious neighbors, but would sometimes exchange a short conversation or a photograph for beer or cigarettes. Some were friendly, others cruel, but none of his encounters deterred Robinson from his nightly walks. He was struck by cars more than once. He stopped his walks during the last years of his life, and retired to the Beaver County Geriatric Center, where he died in 1985 at the age of 74.\n\nRobinson became a local myth in the Pennsylvania area, and his real story was obscured by urban legend. In the stories, he is the \"Green Man\", and as a boy, he wanted to see into a bird's nest so he climbed an electric pole and managed to shock himself. He fell to the ground and lost his eyes, nose, mouth, one ear, and one arm. The story states that when he grew older, he hid in an abandoned house. The famed nickname of \"Green Man\" came from his skin, which was purported to be green because of the electrical shock he suffered in the stories. Through several generations, Robinson's story has been passed on so many times that his name and his real history have been overshadowed by the ghost story that grew out of them.\n\nA film, titled \"Route 351\" was planned to be produced by filmmaker Tisha York in 2008, to be completed in 2009. Shooting was delayed by the Great Recession and is on hold . York holds the film rights to the story.\n"}

At the time of his death he was curator of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, creating many critically acclaimed exhibitions and contributing widely towards publications on the subject. After his death, an award in his name was set up to recognise creative, high quality and innovative costume exhibitions.\n\nRichard Harrison Martin was born December 4, 1946, at Bryn Mawr, PA. He studied at Swarthmore College, graduating in 1967, and gained two master's degrees, both from Columbia University. As a lecturer, he held academic positions at the School of Visual Arts, New York University, Columbia, the Juilliard School and Parsons School of Design.\n\nRichard Martin taught art history from 1973 at New York University, the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT), and the School of Visual Arts. In 1980 he became involved with fashion exhibitions at FIT where he worked with Harold Koda and Laura Sinderbrand, the director of FIT's Design Laboratory (now the Museum at FIT). He served as the editor in chief of Arts Magazine before his 1991 appointment as executive director of the Shirley Goodman Resource Center, which was responsible for FIT's exhibitions and collections.\n\nThe exhibitions Martin and Koda put up at FIT, including \"The East Village\", \"Fashion and Surrealism\", \"Undercover Story\", and \"Three Women: Madeleine Vionnet, Claire McCardell, Rei Kawakubo\" attracted a great deal of attention. In 1987 they were given a special award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America. Martin would later win another award from the Council in 1996 \"for furthering fashion in art and culture.\" Koda, who worked closely with Martin on exhibitions until they parted company in 1997, later said:\n\nMartin wrote over 100 scholarly papers on a wide range of subjects, such as \"Art History and the Assimilation of Images by Contemporary Artists\", and \"Redress of the Nerds: The Assertion of Nerd Style in Men's Clothing and Imagery in the 1980s.\" He also wrote a number of books on fashion and art, including \"Fashion and Surrealism\" and \"Charles James,\" and co-authored others. Martin was critical of the tendency within the art world to designate fashion into a corner of its own, and not acknowledging designers as artists, rather than merely being commercially driven. He states: I think that’s an abiding problem for artists, that because fashion is so often thought to be less serious than art, artists are afraid that they will vitiate their own work and their own importance as artists by participating in any way in fashion. Artists will often shy away from fashion and yet when it comes to incorporating fashion into their own work—such as David Salle using sort of 1950s fashion sketches in his work—that’s perfectly acceptable.\n\nHe was also editor of \"Dress\", the Costume Society of America's scholarly journal.\n\nRichard Martin died at home in New York, aged 52, of melanoma on November 8, 1999. He was survived by his partner, Dr. Richard Slusarczyk; and by a brother, Robert.\n\nThe Richard Martin Award for Excellence in the Exhibition of Costume was created by the Costume Society of America and launched in 2002. Martin was a valued member of the Society who, in addition to editing \"Dress\", had served on the Board of Directors for six years and stood as President of the Mid-Atlantic region of the Society.

{"id": "29462", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29462", "title": "Sabotage", "text": "Sabotage\n\nSabotage is a deliberate action aimed at weakening a polity, effort or organization through subversion, obstruction, disruption or destruction. One who engages in sabotage is a \"saboteur\". Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions.\n\nAny unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage. Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage.\n\nA popular but false account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that less wealthy workers in France, who wore not leather but wooden shoes, used to throw these \"sabots\" into the machines to disrupt production. This account is not supported by the etymology. Rather, the French source word literally means to \"walk noisily,\" as was done by sabot-wearing labourers, who interrupted production by means of labor disputes, not damage.\n\nOne of its first appearances in French literature is in the \"Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou manières de parler usitées parmi le peuple\" of D'Hautel, edited in 1808.\n\nThe verb \"saboter\" is also found in 1873–1874 in the \"Dictionnaire de la langue française\" of Émile Littré. But it is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of \"deliberately and maliciously destroying property\" or \"working slower\". In 1897, Émile Pouget, a famous syndicalist and anarchist wrote \"action de saboter un travail\" (action of sabotaging a work) in \"Le Père Peinard\" and in 1911 he also wrote a book entitled \"Le Sabotage\".\n\nAt the inception of the Industrial Revolution, skilled workers such as the Luddites (1811–1812) used sabotage as a means of negotiation in labor disputes.\n\nLabor unions such as the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) have advocated sabotage as a means of self-defense and direct action against unfair working conditions.\n\nThe IWW was shaped in part by the industrial unionism philosophy of Big Bill Haywood, and in 1910 Haywood was exposed to sabotage while touring Europe:\n\nThe experience that had the most lasting impact on Haywood was witnessing a general strike on the French railroads. Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic — the French called it \"sabotage\" — won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.\nFor the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: any withdrawal of efficiency, including the slowdown, the strike, working to rule, or creative bungling of job assignments.\n\nOne of the most severe examples was at the construction site of the Robert-Bourassa Generating Station in 1974, in Québec, Canada, when workers used bulldozers to topple electric generators, damaged fuel tanks, and set buildings on fire. The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, Bechtel Corporation.\n\nCertain groups turn to destruction of property to stop environmental destruction or to make visible arguments against forms of modern technology they consider detrimental to the environment. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term eco-terrorist when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the monkey wrench thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by Edward Abbey in the novel \"The Monkey Wrench Gang\" and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.\n\nFrom 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or Earth Liberation Front engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado. ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.\n\nIn war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign agent or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or logistic routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of Black Tom and the Kingsland Explosion. Like spies, saboteurs who conduct a military operation in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms behind enemy lines are subject to prosecution and criminal penalties instead of detention as prisoners of war. It is common for a government in power during war or supporters of the war policy to use the term loosely against opponents of the war. Similarly, German nationalists spoke of a stab in the back having cost them the loss of World War I.\n\nA modern form of sabotage is the distribution of software intended to damage specific industrial systems. For example, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is alleged to have sabotaged a Siberian pipeline during the Cold War, using information from the Farewell Dossier. A more recent case may be the Stuxnet computer worm, which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the Iranian nuclear program by the United States, Israel or, according to the latest news, even Russia.\n\nSabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin. During World War II, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated 19,649 cases of sabotage and concluded the enemy had not caused any of them.\n\nSabotage in warfare, according to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) manual, varies from highly technical \"coup de main\" acts that require detailed planning and specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts that ordinary citizen-saboteurs can perform. Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and reprisal. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the \"human element\". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The \"human element\" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.\n\nThere are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title \"General Interference with Organizations and Production\":\n\n\nFrom the section entitled, \"General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion\" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: \"Act stupid.\"\n\nThe United States Office of Strategic Services, later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: \"... slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time.\" To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, \"Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police.\" The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; \"the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation.\"\n\nOn 30 July 1916, the Black Tom explosion occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in Jersey City, New Jersey that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the Allies in their fight.\n\nOn 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, set fire to his workbench at an ammunition assembly plant near Lyndhurst, New Jersey, causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages. Wozniak's involvement was not discovered until 1927.\n\nOn 12 February 1917, Bedouins allied with the British destroyed a Turkish railroad near the port of Wajh, derailing a Turkish locomotive. The Bedouins traveled by camel and used explosives to demolish a portion of track.\n\nIn Ireland, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) used sabotage against the British following the Easter 1916 uprising. The IRA compromised communication lines and lines of transportation and fuel supplies. The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool. The following year, the IRA set fire to numerous British targets again, including the Dublin Customs House, this time sabotaging most of Liverpool's firetrucks in the firehouses before lighting the matches.\n\nSabotage training for the Allies consisted of teaching would-be saboteurs key components of working machinery to destroy.\n\"Saboteurs learned hundreds of small tricks to cause the Germans big trouble. The cables in a telephone junction box ... could be jumbled to make the wrong connections when numbers were dialed. A few ounces of plastique, properly placed, could bring down a bridge, cave in a mine shaft, or collapse the roof of a railroad tunnel.\"\n\nThe Polish Home Army Armia Krajowa, who commanded the majority of resistance organizations in Poland (even the National Forces, except the Military Organization Lizard Union; The Home Army also included the Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence) and coordinating and aiding the Jewish Military Union as well as more reluctantly helping the Jewish Combat Organization, was responsible for the greatest number of acts of sabotage in German—occupied Europe. The Home Army's sabotage operations Operation Garland and Operation Ribbon are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars \"wagony,\" and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the rail roads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports. As for Stalin's proxies, their actions lead to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The Gwardia Ludowa destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans.\n\nThe French Resistance ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the BBC radio or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three times the number of locomotives damaged by Allied air power. See also Normandy Landings for more information about sabotage on D-Day.\n\nDuring World War II, the Allies committed sabotage against the Peugeot truck factory. After repeated failures in Allied bombing attempts to hit the factory, a team of French Resistance fighters and Special Operations Executive (SOE) agents distracted the German guards with a game of soccer while part of their team entered the plant and destroyed machinery.\n\nIn December 1944, the Germans ran a false flag sabotage infiltration, Operation Greif, which was commanded by Waffen-SS commando Otto Skorzeny during the Battle of the Bulge. German commandos, wearing US Army uniforms, carrying US Army weapons, and using US Army vehicles, penetrated US lines to spread panic and confusion among US troops and to blow up bridges, ammunition dumps, and fuel stores and to disrupt the lines of communication. Many of the commandos were captured by the Americans. Because they were wearing US uniforms, a number of the Germans were executed as spies, either summarily or after military commissions.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1960, the Malayan Communists committed numerous effective acts of sabotage against the Malaysian Government, first targeting railway bridges, then hitting larger targets such as military camps. Most of their efforts were centered around crippling Malaysia's economy and involved sabotage against trains, rubber trees, water pipes, and electric lines. The Communist's sabotage efforts were so successful that they caused backlash amongst the Malaysian population, who gradually withdrew support for the Communist movement as their livelihoods became threatened.\n\nIn Mandatory Palestine from 1945 to 1948, Jewish groups opposed British control. Though that control was to end according to the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The Haganah focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The Stern Gang and the Irgun used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell-shocked Arab railway workers to strike. The 6th Airborne Division was called in to provide security as a means of ending the strike.\n\nThe Viet Cong used swimmer saboteurs often and effectively during the Vietnam War. Between 1969 and 1970, swimmer saboteurs sunk, destroyed, or damaged 77 assets of the U.S. and its allies. Viet Cong swimmers were poorly equipped but well-trained and resourceful. The swimmers provided a low-cost/low-risk option with high payoff; possible loss to the country for failure compared to the possible gains from a successful mission led to the obvious conclusion the swimmer saboteurs were a good idea.\n\nOn 1 January 1984, the Cuscatlan bridge over Lempa river in El Salvador, critical to flow of commercial and military traffic, was destroyed by guerrilla forces using explosives after using mortar fire to \"scatter\" the bridge's guards, causing an estimated $3.7 million in required repairs, and considerably impacting on El Salvadoran business and security.\n\nIn 1982 in Honduras, a group of nine Salvadorans and Nicaraguans destroyed a main electrical power station, leaving the capital city Tegucigalpa without power for three days.\n\nSome criminals have engaged in acts of sabotage for reasons of extortion. For example, Klaus-Peter Sabotta sabotaged German railway lines in the late 1990s in an attempt to extort DM10 million from the German railway operator Deutsche Bahn. He is now serving a sentence of life imprisonment. In 1989, ex-Scotland Yard detective Rodney Whitchelo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for spiking Heinz baby food products in supermarkets, in an extortion attempt on the food manufacturer.\n\nThe term political sabotage is sometimes used to define the acts of one political camp to disrupt, harass or damage the reputation of a political opponent, usually during an electoral campaign, such as during Watergate. Smear campaigns are a commonly used tactic. The term could also describe the actions and expenditures of private entities, corporations and organizations against democratically approved or enacted laws, policies and programs.\n\nAfter the Cold War ended, the Mitrokhin Archives were declassified, which included detailed KGB plans of active measures to subvert politics in opposing nations.\n\nSabotage is a crucial tool of the successful coup d'etat, which requires control of communications before, during, and after the coup is staged. Simple sabotage against physical communications platforms using semi-skilled technicians, or even those trained only for this task, could effectively silence the target government of the coup, leaving the information battle space open to the dominance of the coup's leaders. To underscore the effectiveness of sabotage, \"A single cooperative technician will be able temporarily to put out of action a radio station which would otherwise require a full-scale assault.\"\n\nRailroads, where strategically important to the regime the coup is against, are prime targets for sabotage—if a section of the track is damaged entire portions of the transportation network can be stopped until it is fixed.\n\nA sabotage radio was a small two-way radio designed for use by resistance movements in World War II, and after the war often used by expeditions and similar parties.\n\nArquilla and Rondfeldt, in their work entitled \"Networks and Netwars\", differentiate their definition of \"netwar\" from a list of \"trendy synonyms,\" including \"cybotage,\" a portmanteau from the words \"sabotage\" and \"cyber\". They dub the practitioners of cybotage \"cyboteurs\" and note while all cybotage is not netwar, some netwar is cybotage.\n\nCounter-sabotage, defined by \"Webster's Dictionary\", is \"counterintelligence designed to detect and counteract sabotage\". The United States Department of Defense definition, found in the \"Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms\", is \"action designed to detect and counteract sabotage. See also counterintelligence\".\n\nDuring World War II, British subject Eddie Chapman, trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British. The German Abwehr entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company's main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber, but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission's completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-mâché furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.\n\nIn Japanese, the verb saboru (サボる) means to skip school or loaf on the job.\n\n\n"}

He was a dedicated and talented designer who shared his passion and knowledge of design through teaching at Capilano University as well as working in the commercial field running his own creative agency Salazar Graphics in partnership with his brother Santiago Salazar, A.K.A. Lisa Salazar. Unfortunately the industry lost Enrique to cancer in June 1985 and the Salazar Awards were created by GDC and founding sponsor Met Printers to continue on his passion and commitment to design and communications education.\n\n\"The Salazar brothers were born in Colombia and in 1960 their family moved to the United States, making their home in San Jose, California. Enrique attended West Valley College and hoped to eventually become an architect. In 1968, during the height of the war in Vietnam, he accepted a job offer as a draftsman at a new startup high-tech company in Vancouver, Canada. In the mean time, Santiago graduated from high school and enrolled at San Jose State University to study graphic design. Enrique eventually shifted his focus to graphic design as well and without any formal training, began to produce marketing materials for the company he worked for. One day he saw an ad for an in-house graphic designer at Finning Tractor, the largest Caterpillar dealer in North America, where he honed his skills and learned about print production.\"\n\n\"After Santiago's graduation in 1972, Enrique convinced him to move to Vancouver so they could start their own studio. Reluctant at first, Santiago eventually caved in to Enrique's persuasion, arriving in Vancouver in 1973. Salazar Graphics was founded the following year, with an office at the west end of Vancouver's Gastown district, which at the time had become the epicenter for graphic designers. In 1980, the Salazar brothers were introduced to the retiring head of the Graphic Design and Illustration program at Capilano University and were invited to develop a course, which they titled \"Studio Production,\" and the two brothers taught the course as a tag-team, alternating each week. For the fall semester in 1984, due to family business obligations, Santiago had to leave the teaching to Enrique. It was at the end of the semester Enrique's health began to deteriorate and resigned as instructor. Santiago returned to teaching the following year.\"\n\nSince 1956 the GDC has been dedicated to improving graphic design standards and practice, in the workplace and in schools, and the importance of nurturing design professionals and attracting young talent to the industry cannot be over-emphasized. This is the primary reason for events such as Salazar Awards. The Salazar Student Design Awards encourage and support students in taking their design education to a level that will better prepare them for professional practice.\n\nA judging committee of top design professionals review submissions and select winners and honourable mentions based on strategy and rationales provided, as well as the level of visual execution. Winning students and honourable mentions are be promoted to the design, advertising and business communities through an awards evening and exhibit of their work.\n\nSpeakers at recent Salazar awards ceremonies have included Coudal Partners founder Jim Coudal [2006], Rethink Creative Director Ian Grais [2007], legendary designer Stefan Sagmeister [2008] and Michael Osborne of MOD & Joey's Corner [2009].\n\nPrevious notable winners have included Jim Skipp (1988), Kiky Kambylis (1989), Sean Carter (1990), Nancy Wu (1991), Oliver Oike (2000) and Don Williams (2002).\n\n2006 winners included Andrew Clequin, Christopher Swift, Henry Huynh, Sherry Jang, Robyn Sommerville, Olga Gryb, Kathryn Wright, Bart Sciana, Yoonju Chung and Sanaz Afshar.\n\n2007 winners included Carlos Guimaraes, Jeff Greenberg & Eric Wada, Jeff Kwok, Stefan Belavy, Ryan Uhrich & Marcos Ceravolo, Ross Milne, Chelsea McKenzie, Megan Brooks, Kim Ridgewell, Penelope Tse, Ashley Hostasek, Ryan Mah, Abi Huynh & Ross Milne, Terry Chau, Eric Arnold, Megan Seely, Ross Milne, Megan Brooks, Marty Chow and Eric Arnold\n\n2013 winners include Daniel Gleiberman & Elena Syrovatkina from Emily Carr University for Motion & Video; Joan Gurney, Capilano University for Interactive; Alex Harvey-Wickens, Capilano University for Print; and Camille Segur, Capilano University for Brand Identity.\n\n"}

The premise of the site was that the website's anonymous webmasters would eat Toby, a pet rabbit, unless they received $50,000 in donations to care for it. The website also spawned a book, fully titled: Save Toby: Only YOU have the power to save Toby!\n\nThe website was created near the beginning of 2005.

However, it did, and he was unable to afford to care for him. The website then claimed that, unless he received $50,000 in US dollars to pay for its care, he would eat the rabbit. The money could be either donated directly, or through purchasing \"Save Toby\" merchandise. The website includes several pictures of Toby, as well as many recipes that can be used to prepare and cook rabbit. The webmasters have remained anonymous, claiming they have received death threats. They go by the names \"James\" and \"Brian\"; however, \"James\" admits his name is a pseudonym.\n\nThe original deadline for receiving the money was June 30, 2005. When the deadline passed, they extended it to November 6, 2006, claiming that problems with Paypal made it impossible for people to donate money and that it was the only fair thing to do for Toby. It was later changed to Thanksgiving Day, 2006, because of the release of the book. In December 2006, the site announced that humor/games website bored.com had purchased the website, and therefore Toby had been saved. It is claimed that over $24,000 was collected by the website.\n\nThe book was released in September 2005. The book made a new threat: if 100,000 copies of the book were not sold, Toby would be eaten at Thanksgiving dinner. The number of copies of the book sold is unknown. The book includes pictures of Toby, and various recipes for cooking rabbit. It also has instructions on how to run a similar site.\n\nThe website received media attention throughout the United States and in other countries. Toby was also featured on NBC Nightly News.\n\nThe website made many animal rights activists upset, claiming that the owners were engaging in animal cruelty. They attempted to have the site removed; however, the company that hosted the site, Go Daddy, claimed that there was nothing illegal about the site and that \"it was perfectly legal to eat a rabbit\". PayPal accounts used for donations were often frozen due to complaints about the site.\n\nThere have also been questions about whether or not the site was legitimate. The owners, when asked, claimed that the site was completely serious and they would eat the rabbit. However, the nature of the website suggests it is a hoax or joke, a retelling of older jokes that threaten harm to an animal unless you buy a product (for example, National Lampoon once ran a cover with a gun aimed at a puppy, stating \"If You Don't buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog\"). The site itself never makes it clear that it is a joke; however, \"funny\" and \"humor\" are included in the site's search keywords.\n\nThere were other similar websites in existence around the same time that threatened to eat a rabbit unless a monetary demand was met. One, \"Save Bernd!\", copied Save Toby. It demanded a 1,000,000 euro ransom. The site claims that \"Bernd is gone\", but not that he was eaten. Small letters at the bottom of the page make it clear that \"It's a joke\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56656382", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56656382", "title": "Siege of Eastern Ghouta", "text": "Siege of Eastern Ghouta\n\nThe Siege of Eastern Ghouta was a siege that was laid by Syrian Government forces in April 2013, to the area in eastern Ghouta held by anti-government forces since November 2012, during the Syrian Civil War. The cities and villages under siege were Douma, Mesraba, Arbin, Hamouria, Saqba, Modira, Eftreis, Jisrin, as well as suburbs of Damascus Beit Sawa, Harasta, Zamalka, Ein Tarma and Kafr Batna. By 2016, around 400,000 people were trapped in an area just over 100 square kilometres in size, thus with a population density around 4,000 hab./km². \n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 2401, adopted on 28 February 2018, called for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria for 30 days, including Eastern Ghouta, but the Syrian Army continued the offensive. In March 2018, the Syrian Army split the enclave into three parts, reaching an agreement with the rebels to withdraw to the north, to Idlib. This action displaced 105,000 people from the area. Douma was the only city left by the end of that month that was not under Syrian government control. \n\nOn 8 April 2018, an agreement had been reached to evacuate remaining fighters and civilians from the last rebel-controlled pocket of Douma after an alleged chemical weapons attack that reportedly killed 70 people. The Syrian Government denied responsibility, together with its ally involved in the war, Russia. More than 50,000 people, including fighters from the Jaish al-Islam and their families, have been evacuated out of the city as part of the deal, to northern Syria. Around 200 hostages loyal to the Syrian Government have reportedly been released by the rebels. Russian military police were deployed to Douma to enforce the agreement. \n\nThousands of people were killed during this 5-year siege period. Numerous war crimes allegations were made during the siege, among others from the United Nations Human Rights Council, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation.\n\nPrior to the Syrian Civil War, the total population of Eastern Ghouta, a collection of farms and cities near Damascus, was around 1.5 million people. During the civil unrest that began in Syria in March 2011, some of the eastern Ghouta residents took part in the protests against the Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad and joined the Syrian rebels and expelled Syrian government forces by November 2012. In February 2013, Syrian rebels captured parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the Jobar district of the capital city. Backed by Iran and Hezbollah, the Syrian Arab Army counterattacked and in April 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta, which is just 15 km or a half hour's drive outside the capital Damascus. Cut off from the rest of the country, the population of Eastern Ghouta resorted to incineration of plastics to generate electricity. In early 2015, when the Syrian government cut off water supplies to Duma, the population adapted yet again and dug over 600 underground wells, using manual pumps to supply water.\n\nIn mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was Jaysh al-Islam, based in Douma (with an estimated 10-15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018). The second largest was Faylaq al-Rahman, an official affiliate of the Free Syrian Army (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the Jobar and Ain Terma districts. Ahrar al-Sham (based in Harasta) and Tahrir al-Sham (HTS - controlling smaller districts such as Arbin, al-Ashari and Bait Naim, with an estimated strength in the area of 500 in February 2018) had a far smaller presence.\n\nIn August 2013, the area was subjected to a chemical attack that killed hundreds of people, after which an agreement was made to ban chemical weapons in Syria. From 14 to 30 November 2017, the Russian-Syrian forces conducted more than 400 airstrikes in the area, hitting markets, schools and houses, and during some of those airstrikes allegedly using banned cluster munition.\n\nDespite efforts at turning Ghouta into a de-escalation zone, reports of bombs allegedly containing weaponised chlorine were registered again in early 2018. By January 2018, the area had only a single doctor per 3,600 people. Inter-rebel fighting in 2016 and once again in 2017 deteriorated the situation even further, showing a lack of unity among the rebel groups.\nAfter a series of offensive operations launched by Syrian rebels against positions of the Syrian Arab Army in Harasta, a northeastern suburb of Damascus, and other locations in Ghouta, the Syrian Arab Army launched an operation to capture the rebel-held part of Ghouta in February 2018. The escalation of hostilities led to a United Nations Security Council meeting held on 24 February 2018, voting unanimously in favor of a 30-day cease-fire in Syria, and demanded immediate lifting of the siege of eastern Ghouta. In March 2018 the government offensive continued, being supported by the Russia both diplomatically and militarily. On 11 March, the Syrian government took control over several areas and split the enclave into three pockets. These pockets include Duma and its northeastern outskirts, eastern Harasta, and Zamalka and surrounding area.\n\nIn mid-late March after a series of negotiations, a deal was finally reached between the Syrian government and rebels that controlled parts of Eastern Ghouta. The deal involved a transfer of remaining rebel fighters from the areas of eastern Harasta, Zamalka and surrounding areas to the province of Idlib. 105,000 people were displaced by this evacuation from the area. By the end of March, Douma was the last pocket controlled by the rebels, the Jaish al-Islam fighters.\n\nFor at least 10 days, there were minimal attacks on the rebel pocket of Douma as talks with the Jaish al-Islam continued. It was reported later that the Jaish al-Islam shelled residential areas in Damascus, causing casualties and material damage. By 6 April, talks had \"faltered\" between the two sides and the SAA renewed their offensive in response to the attack. The Jaish al-Islam denied responsibility. The rebel group had also reportedly refused to release detainees loyal to the Syrian government it was holding in Douma. The shelling on 8 April 2018, which left several civilians dead, drew allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma, though the UN could not verify the claim initially.\n\nIn February 2018, the Syrian Network for Human Rights, a UK-based non-governmental organization, founded in June 2011, published a report alleging that 12,783 civilians were killed in and around Eastern Ghouta from March 2011 to February 2018, including 1,463 children and 1,127 women.\n\nAccording to local hospital sources, which were cited in the French newspaper \"Le Monde\", approximately 18,000 people were killed in the enclave by October 2017.\n\nMédecins Sans Frontières claimed that 70 percent of the enclave's population lived underground by November 2017 to escape bombardments. It also registered that, on average, 71 people were being killed daily since the 18 February 2018 offensive. It registered 1,005 people killed and 4,829 wounded in two weeks alone, between 18 February and 3 March 2018.\n\nNumerous war crimes allegations were made during the battle, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), starvation as a method of warfare and denial of medical evacuation. The siege by the Syrian government left the enclave under a humanitarian crisis, leading to famine and a lack of food. According to a 2014 United Nations report, the denial of food as a military strategy began during July and August 2013: Eastern Ghouta's crops and farms were shelled and burned. The report also alleged that Syrian forces \"blocked access roads and systematically confiscated food, fuel and medicine at checkpoints\". Some inhabitants had to rely on tree leaves as an alternative for vegetables to survive. The rebels established a web of underground tunnels to smuggle supplies, but they were destroyed by the government forces.\n\nUNICEF Representatives said that at least 12% of children under 5 were acutely malnourished in the enclave in early 2018. On 27 October 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, warned that \"the deliberate starvation of civilians as a method of warfare constitutes a clear violation of international humanitarian law\" and called for access of humanitarian workers to deliver aid to the people of Eastern Ghouta. The Syrian government restricted humanitarian aid to the enclave. On 30 October 2017, supplies were allowed to only 40,000 residents in the two cities of Kafr Batna and Saqba. One U.N. aid convoy arrived to Eastern Ghouta in February 2018, only after it had no access for 78 days.\n\nThe Syrian government also used chemical weapons against the armed groups in Eastern Ghouta in July 2017, specifically in Ein Tarma (1 July), Zamalka (2 July) and Jobar (6 July), and on Harasta on 18 November 2017. The agents included chlorine gas and organophosphorous pesticide. The Syrian government also used internationally banned incendiary weapons. In one such incident reported on 16 March 2018, at 11:48am, these weapons were dropped on Kafr Batna, killing at least 61 and wounding over 200 people.\n\nIn December 2017, satellite imagery analysis by UN experts concluded that 3,853 buildings were destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged in the western parts of the enclave. The suburb of Jobar was 93 % destroyed, Ein Tarma 73 % and Zamalka 59 %. Hospitals in Eastern Ghouta were reported to have been shelled: Syrian army forces destroyed a field hospital in Al-Zemaniyah during a ground operation in July 2013, while shells landed near Al-Fatih hospital, where victims of the chemical attack were treated, forcing it to discharge its patients. Between 4 and 21 February 2018, the Syrian-Russian bombardments killed 346 people in Eastern Ghouta. Local counts reported 700 deaths in the three months up to mid-February 2018, many of them civilians. On 7 December 2017, the United Nations Senior Advisor Jan Egeland called east Ghouta the \"epicenter of suffering\".\n\nAfter the end of the siege, tens of thousands of people have been unlawfully interned by the Syrian Government forces in rural Damascus, including Ghouta. Amnesty International has called the \"unlawful siege and unlawful killing of civilians, including the use of internationally banned cluster munitions\" by the Syrian government and Russia a war crime and a crime against humanity.\n\nThe United Nations also found the four largest rebel factions that were active in eastern Ghouta, namely Jaysh al-Islam, the Al-Rahman Legion, Ahrar al-Sham, and Tahrir al-Sham, guilty of crimes against humanity. They were known to arrest and torture members of religious minority groups, and regularly fired mortars and rockets from eastern Ghouta at government-held areas. These attacks aimed at spreading terror, and killed many civilians.\n\n2013: After the alleged chemical weapons attack in the Ghouta area of Damascus, the UN sent an inspection team to begin an investigation. The final report concluded that evidence suggests that \"surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka\". The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it \"one-sided\" and \"distorted\".\n\n2018: After the start of the renewed SAA offensive called \"Rif Dimashq offensive\" during mid-February, the UN proposed a 30-day ceasefire aimed at allowing aid deliveries to enter besieged areas, as well as medical evacuations. This ceasefire was \"ignored\" as the SAA continued its advances into the rebel-controlled areas. It was reported that in the following month, some 25 food trucks were allowed in. Some argued that this was simply not enough for the people living in war-torn areas.\n\nThe governments of the United States, United Kingdom and France accused the Syrian government of a chemical attack against the population of Douma on April 2018. As a consequence, the three states conducted a series of airstrikes targeting sites associated with Syria's chemical weapons capabilities in Damascus and Homs on 14 April 2018. The next day, Russia tried to pass a resolution condemning these US-UK-French airstrikes, but it was not adopted by the U.N. Security Council.\n\n"}

After graduating from a local high school, he was commissioned as Midshipman in the Pakistan Navy in 1948 in Surface warfare branch and was initially trained at the Pakistan Military Academy. He was later trained in the United Kingdom as a communication specialist and as the surface warfare officer and promoted as Sub-Lieutenant after returning to Pakistan. His further military training came from the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, England and did qualified on courses on military communications.\n\nIn 1965, Lieutenant TK Khan participated in second war with India and served on PNS Shah Jahan as its executive officer while taking part on naval shelling in Dwarka, India.\n\nIn 1969, he was promoted as Lieutenant-Commander and Commander after posting in East Pakistan as commanding officer of . Cdr TK Khan also helped the Pakistan Army with the communication gears and firing at the East Pakistan Rifles headquarters to crush Bengali resistance in Chittagong area.\n\nCdr Khan participated on various military riverine missions while commanding a gunboat, \"Jahangir\", and was taken war prisoner after the accessioning the surrender with India in 1971. He was repatriated to Pakistan and continue resuming his military service when he was promoted as Captain in the Navy.\n\nFrom 1975–1978, Captain Khan was posted in the Foreign ministry to be served as naval attaché to the Pakistan High Commission in London, United Kingdom. Upon returning to Pakistan, he was promoted to one-star rank, Commodore and posted in Karachi for a command assignment in 1978.\n\nCdre Khan commanded the 18th Destroyer Squadron as its officer commanding until 1980 after promoting as Rear-Admiral.\n\nRear-Admiral Khan was appointed Commander Karachi (COMKAR) until 1983 when he succeeded Admiral K.R. Niazi as Chief of Naval Staff. On 22 March 1983, President Zia-ul-Haq announced to appoint Rear-Admiral Khan as the Chief of Naval Staff but this promotion came with controversy. Rear-Admiral TK Khan, a junior admiral, supersedes the most senior Vice-Admiral Iqbal Quadir and two senior Rear-Admirals for the command of the Navy in 1983. Rear-Admiral TK Khan was known to be close to President Zia and had experience in military administration in civil affairs from the East Pakistan, that may have been a factor for his appointment to the four-star appointment. After his appointment was announced, Rear-Admiral Tariq Kamal Khan was appointed as four-star rank admiral in the Navy.\n\nIn 1983, he helped negotiated the acquisition of Mirage V aircraft from France for the Pakistan Air Force when he traveled to Paris, France.\n\nAs naval chief, Admiral TK Khan began initiating a program to acquire and procure modern warships to replace and scrap the aging warships in service with the Navy. Admiral Tariq Kamal worked closely towards strengthening bilateral relations between China and Pakistan, briefly meeting with Chinese President Li Xiannian for that purpose in 1984.\n\nAdmiral Tariq Kamal Khan remained naval chief until naval chief he sought retirement from his active service and handed over the command to his VCNS, Vice-Admiral Iftikhar Ahmed Sirohey.\n\nAfter his retirement from Navy, Admiral Khan joined the Foreign Service when he was nominated to be appointed as High Commissioner of Pakistan to Australia by President Zia and served from 1986 until 1992 when he retired from the foreign service. During his tenure as High Commissioner, he helped secure the deal of second-hand and Royal Australian Air Force's retired Dassault Mirage III to be inducted in the service with Pakistan Air Force in 1990.\n\nIn 1992, Admiral Tariq Kamal retired from the Foreign Service and currently lives on military pension.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2350918", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2350918", "title": "Thermal runaway", "text": "Thermal runaway\n\nThermal runaway occurs in situations where an increase in temperature changes the conditions in a way that causes a further increase in temperature, often leading to a destructive result. It is a kind of uncontrolled positive feedback.\n\nIn other words, \"thermal runaway\" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In chemistry (and chemical engineering), it is associated with strongly exothermic reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In electrical engineering, thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in civil engineering, notably when the heat released by large amounts of curing concrete is not controlled. In astrophysics, runaway nuclear fusion reactions in stars can lead to nova and several types of supernova explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the \"helium flash\".\n\nThere are also concerns regarding global warming that a global average increase of 3–4 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial baseline could lead to a further unchecked increase in surface temperatures. For example, releases of methane, a greenhouse gas more potent than CO, from wetlands, melting permafrost and continental margin seabed clathrate deposits could be subject to positive feedback.\n\nThermal runaway is also called thermal explosion in chemical engineering, or runaway reaction in organic chemistry. It is a process by which an exothermic reaction goes out of control: the reaction rate increases due to an increase in temperature, causing a further increase in temperature and hence a further rapid increase in the reaction rate. This has contributed to industrial chemical accidents, most notably the 1947 Texas City disaster from overheated ammonium nitrate in a ship's hold, and the 1976 explosion of zoalene, in a drier, at King's Lynn. Frank-Kamenetskii theory provides a simplified analytical model for thermal explosion. Chain branching is an additional positive feedback mechanism which may also cause temperature to skyrocket because of rapidly increasing reaction rate.\n\nChemical reactions are either endothermic or exothermic, as expressed by their change in enthalpy. Many reactions are highly exothermic, so many industrial-scale and oil refinery processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway. These include hydrocracking, hydrogenation, alkylation (S2), oxidation, metalation and nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For example, oxidation of cyclohexane into cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone and ortho-xylene into phthalic anhydride have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed.\n\nThermal runaway may result from unwanted exothermic side reaction(s) that begin at higher temperatures, following an initial accidental overheating of the reaction mixture. This scenario was behind the Seveso disaster, where thermal runaway heated a reaction to temperatures such that in addition to the intended 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, poisonous 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was also produced, and was vented into the environment after the reactor's rupture disk burst.\n\nThermal runaway is most often caused by failure of the reactor vessel's cooling system. Failure of the mixer can result in localized heating, which initiates thermal runaway. Similarly, in flow reactors, localized insufficient mixing causes hotspots to form, wherein thermal runaway conditions occur, which causes violent blowouts of reactor contents and catalysts. Incorrect equipment component installation is also a common cause. Many chemical production facilities are designed with high-volume emergency venting, a measure to limit the extent of injury and property damage when such accidents occur.\n\nAt large scale, it is unsafe to \"charge all reagents and mix\", as is done in laboratory scale. This is because the amount of reaction scales with the cube of the size of the vessel (V ∝ r³), but the heat transfer area scales with the square of the size (A ∝ r²), so that the heat production-to-area ratio scales with the size (V/A ∝ r). Consequently, reactions that easily cool fast enough in the laboratory can dangerously self-heat at ton scale. In 2007, this kind of erroneous procedure caused an explosion of a -reactor used to metalate methylcyclopentadiene with metallic sodium, causing the loss of four lives and parts of the reactor being flung away. Thus, industrial scale reactions prone to thermal runaway are preferably controlled by the addition of one reagent at a rate corresponding to the available cooling capacity.\n\nSome laboratory reactions must be run under extreme cooling, because they are very prone to hazardous thermal runaway. For example, in Swern oxidation, the formation of sulfonium chloride must be performed in a cooled system (–30 °C), because at room temperature the reaction undergoes explosive thermal runaway.\n\nThe UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum publishes analysis of previously-unreported chemical accidents to assist the education of the scientific and engineering community, with the aim of preventing similar occurrences elsewhere. Almost 150 such reports are available to view as of January 2009.\n\nMicrowaves are used for heating of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the dielectric constant of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas—potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called \"thermal runaway materials\". This phenomenon occurs in some ceramics.\n\nSome electronic components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power dissipation may raise the temperature further by Joule heating. A vicious circle or positive feedback effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or PTC current limiters.\n\nTo handle larger currents, circuit designers may connect multiple lower-capacity devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, or MOVs) in parallel. This technique can work well, but is susceptible to a phenomenon called current hogging, in which the current is not shared equally across all devices. Typically, one device may have a slightly lower resistance, and thus draws more current, heating it more than its sibling devices, causing its resistance to drop further. The electrical load ends up funneling into a single device, which then rapidly fails. Thus, an array of devices may end up no more robust than its weakest component.\n\nThe current-hogging effect can be reduced by carefully matching the characteristics of each paralleled device, or by using other design techniques to balance the electrical load. However, maintaining load balance under extreme conditions may not be straightforward. Devices with an intrinsic positive temperature coefficient (PTC) of electrical resistance are less prone to current hogging, but thermal runaway can still occur because of poor heat sinking or other problems.\n\nMany electronic circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This is most often seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when air cooling vents are blocked.\n\nSilicon shows a peculiar profile, in that its electrical resistance increases with temperature up to about 160 °C, then starts \"decreasing\", and drops further when the melting point is reached. This can lead to thermal runaway phenomena within internal regions of the semiconductor junction; the resistance decreases in the regions which become heated above this threshold, allowing more current to flow through the overheated regions, in turn causing yet more heating in comparison with the surrounding regions, which leads to further temperature increase and resistance decrease. This leads to the phenomenon of current crowding and formation of current filaments (similar to current hogging, but within a single device), and is one of the underlying causes of many semiconductor junction failures.\n\nLeakage current increases significantly in bipolar transistors (especially germanium-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending on the design of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the power dissipation, causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a push–pull stage of a class AB amplifier. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are biased to have minimal crossover distortion at room temperature, and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices.\n\nOne rule of thumb to avoid thermal runaway is to keep the operating point of a BJT so that V ≤ 1/2V\n\nAnother practice is to mount a thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the output transistors heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor. This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor to turn on at a slightly lower voltage, reducing the crossover bias voltage, and so reducing the heat dissipated by the output transistors.\n\nIf multiple BJT transistors are connected in parallel (which is typical in high current applications), a current hogging problem can occur. Special measures must be taken to control this characteristic vulnerability of BJTs.\n\nIn power transistors (which effectively consist of many small transistors in parallel), current hogging can occur between different parts of the transistor itself, with one part of the transistor becoming more hot than the others. This is called second breakdown, and can result in destruction of the transistor even when the average junction temperature seems to be at a safe level.\n\nPower MOSFETs typically increase their on-resistance with temperature. Under some circumstances, power dissipated in this resistance causes more heating of the junction, which further increases the junction temperature, in a positive feedback loop. As a consequence, power MOSFETs have stable and unstable regions of operation. However, the increase of on-resistance with temperature helps balance current across multiple MOSFETs connected in parallel, so current hogging does not occur. If a MOSFET transistor produces more heat than the heatsink can dissipate, then thermal runaway can still destroy the transistors. This problem can be alleviated to a degree by lowering the thermal resistance between the transistor die and the heatsink. See also Thermal Design Power.\n\nMetal oxide varistors typically develop lower resistance as they heat up. If connected directly across an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against electrical transients), a MOV which has developed a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire. To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.\n\nTantalum capacitors are under some conditions prone to self-destruction by thermal runaway. The capacitor typically consists of a sintered tantalum sponge acting as the anode, a manganese dioxide cathode, and a dielectric layer of tantalum pentoxide created on the tantalum sponge surface by anodizing. It may happen that the tantalum oxide layer has weak spots that undergo dielectric breakdown during a voltage spike. The tantalum sponge then comes into direct contact with the manganese dioxide, and increased leakage current causes localized heating; usually, this drives an endothermic chemical reaction that produces manganese(III) oxide and regenerates (self-heals) the tantalum oxide dielectric layer.\n\nHowever, if the energy dissipated at the failure point is high enough, a self-sustaining exothermic reaction can start, similar to the thermite reaction, with metallic tantalum as fuel and manganese dioxide as oxidizer. This undesirable reaction will destroy the capacitor, producing smoke and possibly flame.\n\nTherefore, tantalum capacitors can be freely deployed in small-signal circuits, but application in high-power circuits must be carefully designed to avoid thermal runaway failures.\n\nThe leakage current of logic switching transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this may lead to thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up a small portion of overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an Athlon 64, the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius. For a device with a TDP of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a thermal resistivity of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances.) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.\n\nWhen handled improperly, or if manufactured defectively, some rechargeable batteries can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Sealed cells will sometimes explode violently if safety vents are overwhelmed or nonfunctional. Especially prone to thermal runaway are lithium-ion batteries, most markedly in the form of the lithium polymer battery. Reports of exploding cellphones occasionally appear in newspapers. In 2006, batteries from Apple, HP, Toshiba, Lenovo, Dell and other notebook manufacturers were recalled because of fire and explosions. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation has established regulations regarding the carrying of certain types of batteries on airplanes because of their instability in certain situations. This action was partially inspired by a cargo bay fire on a UPS airplane.\nOne of the possible solutions is in using safer and less reactive anode (lithium titanates) and cathode (lithium iron phosphate) materials — thereby avoiding the cobalt electrodes in many lithium rechargeable cells — together with non-flammable electrolytes based on ionic liquids.\n\nRunaway thermonuclear reactions can occur in stars when nuclear fusion is ignited in conditions under which the pressure exerted by overlying layers of the star greatly exceeds thermal pressure, a situation that makes possible rapid increases in temperature. Such a scenario may arise in stars containing degenerate matter, in which electron degeneracy pressure rather than normal thermal pressure does most of the work of supporting the star against gravity, and in stars undergoing implosion. In all cases, the imbalance arises prior to fusion ignition; otherwise, the fusion reactions would be naturally regulated to counteract temperature changes and stabilize the star. When thermal pressure is in equilibrium with overlying pressure, a star will respond to the increase in temperature and thermal pressure due to initiation of a new exothermic reaction by expanding and cooling. A runaway reaction is only possible when this response is inhibited.\n\nWhen stars in the 0.8–2.0 solar mass range exhaust the hydrogen in their cores and become red giants, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches a critical mass of about 0.45 solar masses, helium fusion is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the helium flash, briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon. While the release is sufficient to convert the core back into normal plasma after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star, nor immediately change its luminosity. The star then contracts, leaving the red giant phase and continuing its evolution into a stable helium-burning phase.\n\nA nova results from runaway hydrogen fusion (via the CNO cycle) in the outer layer of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf has a companion star from which it can accrete gas, the material will accumulate in a surface layer made degenerate by the dwarf's intense gravity. Under the right conditions, a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen is eventually heated to a temperature of 20 million K, igniting runaway fusion. The surface layer is blasted off the white dwarf, increasing luminosity by a factor on the order of 50,000. The white dwarf and companion remain intact, however, so the process can repeat. A much rarer type of nova may occur when the outer layer that ignites is composed of helium.\n\nAnalogous to the process leading to novae, degenerate matter can also accumulate on the surface of a neutron star that is accreting gas from a close companion. If a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen accumulates, ignition of runaway hydrogen fusion can then lead to an X-ray burst. As with novae, such bursts tend to repeat and may also be triggered by helium or even carbon fusion. It has been proposed that in the case of \"superbursts\", runaway breakup of accumulated heavy nuclei into iron group nuclei via photodissociation rather than nuclear fusion could contribute the majority of the energy of the burst.\n\nA type Ia supernova results from runaway carbon fusion in the core of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf, which is composed almost entirely of degenerate matter, can gain mass from a companion, the increasing temperature and density of material in its core will ignite carbon fusion if the star's mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit. This leads to an explosion that completely disrupts the star. Luminosity increases by a factor of greater than 5 billion. One way to gain the additional mass would be by accreting gas from a giant star (or even main sequence) companion. A second and apparently more common mechanism to generate the same type of explosion is the merger of two white dwarfs.\n\nA pair-instability supernova is believed to result from runaway oxygen fusion in the core of a massive, 130–250 solar mass, low to moderate metallicity star. According to theory, in such a star, a large but relatively low density core of nonfusing oxygen builds up, with its weight supported by the pressure of gamma rays produced by the extreme temperature. As the core heats further, the gamma rays eventually begin to pass the energy threshold needed for collision-induced decay into electron-positron pairs, a process called pair production. This causes a drop in the pressure within the core, leading it to contract and heat further, causing more pair production, a further pressure drop, and so on. The core starts to undergo gravitational collapse. At some point this ignites runaway oxygen fusion, releasing enough energy to obliterate the star. These explosions are rare, perhaps about one per 100,000 supernovae.\n\nNot all supernovae are triggered by runaway nuclear fusion. Type Ib, Ic and type II supernovae also undergo core collapse, but because they have exhausted their supply of atomic nuclei capable of undergoing exothermic fusion reactions, they collapse all the way into neutron stars, or in the higher-mass cases, stellar black holes, powering explosions by the release of gravitational potential energy (largely via release of neutrinos). It is the absence of runaway fusion reactions that allows such supernovae to leave behind compact stellar remnants.\n\n"}

{"id": "263385", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263385", "title": "True Cross", "text": "True Cross\n\nThe True Cross is the name for physical remnants which, by a Christian Church tradition, are said to be from the cross upon which Jesus was crucified.\n\nAccording to post-Nicene historians such as Socrates of Constantinople, the Empress Helena, mother of Emperor Constantine, the first Christian Emperor of Rome, travelled to the Holy Land in 326–328, founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor. Historians Gelasius of Caesarea and Rufinus claimed that she discovered the hiding place of three crosses that were believed to have been used at the crucifixion of Jesus and of two thieves, St. Dismas and Gestas, executed with him; to one cross was affixed the titulus bearing Jesus' name, but Helena was not sure until a miracle revealed that that cross was the True Cross.\n\nMany churches possess fragmentary remains that are by tradition alleged to be those of the True Cross. Their authenticity is not accepted by all Christians, mainly Protestants; however the bulk of Roman Catholic and Orthodox believers recognize them as genuine pieces of the cross of Christ. The acceptance and belief of that part of the tradition that pertains to the early Christian Church is generally restricted to the Catholic Church, Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodox Church, and the Church of the East. The medieval legends that developed concerning the provenance of the True Cross differ between Catholic and Orthodox tradition.\n\nIn the Latin-speaking traditions of Western Europe, the story of the pre-Christian origins of the True Cross was well established by the 13th century when, in 1260, it was recorded by Jacopo de Voragine, Bishop of Genoa, in the \"Golden Legend\".\n\n\"The Golden Legend\" contains several versions of the origin of the True Cross. In \"The Life of Adam\", Voragine writes that the True Cross came from three trees which grew from three seeds from the \"Tree of Mercy\" which Seth collected and planted in the mouth of Adam's corpse.\n\nIn another account contained in \"Of the invention of the Holy Cross, and first of this word invention\", Voragine writes that the True Cross came from a tree that grew from part of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, or \"the tree that Adam ate of\", that Seth planted on Adam's grave where it \"endured there unto the time of Solomon\".\n\nAfter many centuries, the tree was cut down and the wood used to build a bridge over which the Queen of Sheba passed, on her journey to meet King Solomon. So struck was she by the portent contained in the timber of the bridge that she fell on her knees and revered it. On her visit to Solomon, she told him that a piece of wood from the bridge would bring about the replacement of God's covenant with the Jewish people by a new order. Solomon, fearing the eventual destruction of his people, had the timber buried.\n\nAfter fourteen generations, the wood taken from the bridge was fashioned into the Cross used to crucify Christ.\n\nVoragine then goes on to describe its finding by Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine.\n\nIn the late Middle Ages and Early Renaissance, there was a wide general acceptance of the origin of the True Cross and its history preceding the crucifixion of Jesus, as recorded by Voragine. This general acceptance is confirmed by the numerous artworks that depict this subject, culminating in one of the most famous fresco cycles of the Renaissance, the \"Legend of the True Cross\" by Piero della Francesca, painted on the walls of the chancel of the Church of San Francesco in Arezzo between 1452 and 1466, in which he reproduces faithfully the traditional episodes of the story as recorded in \"The Golden Legend\".\n\n\"The Golden Legend\" and many of its sources developed after the East-West Schism of 1054, and thus is unknown in the Greek- or Syriac-speaking worlds. The above pre-crucifixion history, therefore, is not to be found in Eastern Christianity.\n\nAccording to the sacred tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church the True Cross was made from three different types of wood: cedar, pine and cypress. This is an allusion to : \"The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box [cypress] together to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious.\" The link between this verse and the Crucifixion lies in the words, \"the place of my feet\", which is interpreted as referring to the \"suppedāneum\" (foot rest) on which Jesus' feet were nailed (see Orthodox cross). (Compare with the Jewish concept of the Ark of the Covenant, or indeed the Jerusalem Temple, as being the resting place for God's foot-stool, and the prescribed Three Pilgrimage Festivals, in Hebrew \"aliya la-regel\", lit. \"ascending to the foot\").\n\nThere is a tradition that the three trees from which the True Cross was constructed grew together in one spot. A traditional Orthodox icon depicts Lot, the nephew of Abraham, watering the trees. According to tradition, these trees were used to construct the Temple in Jerusalem (\"to beautify the place of my sanctuary\"). Later, during Herod's reconstruction of the Temple, the wood from these trees was removed from the Temple and discarded, eventually being used to construct the cross on which Jesus was crucified (\"and I will make the place of my feet glorious\").\n\nAccording to the 1955 Roman Catholic Marian Missal, Helena went to Jerusalem to search for the True Cross and found it September 14, 320. In the eighth century, the feast of the Finding was transferred to May 3, and September 14th became the celebration of the \"Exaltation of the Cross\", the commemoration of a victory over the Persians by Heraclius, as a result of which the relic was returned to Jerusalem.\n\nEusebius of Caesarea, in his \"Life of Constantine\", describes how the site of the Holy Sepulchre, once a site of veneration for the Christian church in Jerusalem, had been covered with earth and a temple of Venus had been built on top. Although Eusebius does not say as much, this would probably have been done as part of Hadrian's reconstruction of Jerusalem as Aelia Capitolina in 135, following the destruction during the Jewish Revolt of 70 and Bar Kokhba's revolt of 132–135. Following his conversion to Christianity, Emperor Constantine ordered in about 325–326 that the site be uncovered and instructed Saint Macarius, Bishop of Jerusalem, to build a church on the site. In his \"Life of Constantine\", Eusebius does not mention the finding of the True Cross.\n\nSocrates Scholasticus (born c. 380), in his \"Ecclesiastical History,\" gives a full description of the discovery that was repeated later by Sozomen and by Theodoret. In it he describes how Saint Helena, Constantine's aged mother, had the pagan temple destroyed and the Sepulchre uncovered, whereupon three crosses, the titulus, and the nails from Jesus's crucifixion were uncovered as well. In Socrates's version of the story, Macarius had the three crosses placed in turn on a deathly ill woman. This woman recovered at the touch of the third cross, which was taken as a sign that this was the cross of Christ, the new Christian symbol. Socrates also reports that, having also found the Holy Nails (the nails with which Christ had been fastened to the cross), Helena sent these to Constantinople, where they were incorporated into the emperor's helmet and the bridle of his horse.\n\nSozomen (died c. 450), in his \"Ecclesiastical History\", gives essentially the same version as Socrates. He also adds that it was said (by whom he does not say) that the location of the Sepulchre was \"disclosed by a Hebrew who dwelt in the East, and who derived his information from some documents which had come to him by paternal inheritance\" (although Sozomen himself disputes this account) and that a dead person was also revived by the touch of the Cross. Later popular versions of this story state that the Jew who assisted Helena was named Jude or Judas, but later converted to Christianity and took the name Kyriakos.\n\nTheodoret (died c. 457) in his \"Ecclesiastical History\" Chapter xvii gives what had become the standard version of the finding of the True Cross:\nWith the Cross were also found the Holy Nails, which Helena took with her back to Constantinople. According to Theodoret, \"She had part of the cross of our Saviour conveyed to the palace. The rest was enclosed in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity.\"\n\nAnother popular ancient version from the Syriac tradition replaced Helena with a fictitious first-century empress named Protonike.\n\nThe silver reliquary that was left at the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre in care of the bishop of Jerusalem was exhibited periodically to the faithful. In the 380s a nun named Egeria who was travelling on pilgrimage described the veneration of the True Cross at Jerusalem in a long letter, the \"Itinerario Egeriae\" that she sent back to her community of women:\n\nThen a chair is placed for the bishop in Golgotha behind the [liturgical] Cross, which is now standing; the bishop duly takes his seat in the chair, and a table covered with a linen cloth is placed before him; the deacons stand round the table, and a silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross. The casket is opened and [the wood] is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the title are placed upon the table. Now, when it has been put upon the table, the bishop, as he sits, holds the extremities of the sacred wood firmly in his hands, while the deacons who stand around guard it. It is guarded thus because the custom is that the people, both faithful and catechumens, come one by one and, bowing down at the table, kiss the sacred wood and pass through. And because, I know not when, some one is said to have bitten off and stolen a portion of the sacred wood, it is thus guarded by the deacons who stand around, lest any one approaching should venture to do so again. And as all the people pass by one by one, all bowing themselves, they touch the Cross and the title, first with their foreheads and then with their eyes; then they kiss the Cross and pass through, but none lays his hand upon it to touch it. When they have kissed the Cross and have passed through, a deacon stands holding the ring of Solomon and the horn from which the kings were anointed; they kiss the horn also and gaze at the ring...\n\nBefore long, but perhaps not until after the visit of Egeria, it was possible also to venerate the crown of thorns, the pillar at which Christ was scourged, and the lance that pierced his side.\n\nIn 614 the Sassanid Emperor Khosrau II (\"Chosroes\") removed the part of the cross held in Jerusalem as a trophy, after he captured the city. Thirteen years later, in 628, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius defeated Khosrau and regained the relic from Shahrbaraz. He placed the cross in Constantinople at first, and took it back to Jerusalem on 21 March 630. Some scholars disagree with this narrative, Professor Constantin Zuckerman going as far as to suggest that the True Cross was actually lost by the Persians, and that the wood contained in the allegedly still sealed reliquary brought to Jerusalem by Heraclius in 629 was a fake. In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrbaraz.\n\nAround 1009, the year in which Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, Christians in Jerusalem hid part of the cross and it remained hidden until the city was taken by the European soldiers of the First Crusade. Arnulf Malecorne, the first Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, had the Greek Orthodox priests who were in possession of the Cross tortured in order to reveal its position. The relic that Arnulf discovered was a small fragment of wood embedded in a golden cross, and it became the most sacred relic of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, with none of the controversy that had followed their discovery of the Holy Lance in Antioch. It was housed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre under the protection of the Latin Patriarch, who marched with it ahead of the army before every battle.\n\nAfter King Baldwin I of Jerusalem presented King Sigurd I of Norway with a splinter of the True Cross following the Norwegian Crusade in 1110, the Cross was captured by Saladin during the Battle of Hattin in 1187, and while some Christian rulers, like Richard the Lionheart, Byzantine emperor Isaac II Angelos and Tamar, Queen of Georgia, sought to ransom it from Saladin, the cross was not returned and subsequently disappeared from historical records. The True Cross was last seen in the city of Damascus.\n\nCurrently the Greek Orthodox present a small True Cross relic shown in the so-called Greek Treasury at the foot of Golgotha, within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The Syriac Orthodox Church also has a small relic of the True Cross in St Mark Monastery, Jerusalem.\n\nAn inscription of 359, found at Tixter, in the neighbourhood of Sétif in Mauretania, was said to mention, in an enumeration of relics, a fragment of the True Cross, according to an entry in \"Roman Miscellanies\", X, 441.\n\nFragments of the Cross were broken up, and the pieces were widely distributed; in 348, in one of his \"Catecheses\", Cyril of Jerusalem remarked that the \"whole earth is full of the relics of the Cross of Christ,\" and in another, \"The holy wood of the Cross bears witness, seen among us to this day, and from this place now almost filling the whole world, by means of those who in faith take portions from it.\" Egeria's account testifies to how highly these relics of the crucifixion were prized. Saint John Chrysostom relates that fragments of the True Cross were kept in golden reliquaries, \"which men reverently wear upon their persons.\" Even two Latin inscriptions around 350 from today's Algeria testify to the keeping and admiration of small particles of the cross. Around the year 455, Juvenal Patriarch of Jerusalem sent to Pope Leo I a fragment of the \"precious wood\", according to the \"Letters\" of Pope Leo. A portion of the cross was taken to Rome in the seventh century by Pope Sergius I, who was of Byzantine origin. \"In the small part is power of the whole cross\", so an inscription in the Felix Basilica of Nola, built by bishop Paulinus at the beginning of 5th century. The cross particle was inserted in the altar.\n\nThe Old English poem \"Dream of the Rood\" mentions the finding of the cross and the beginning of the tradition of the veneration of its relics. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" also talks of King Alfred receiving a fragment of the cross from Pope Marinus (see: Annal Alfred the Great, year 883). Although it is possible, the poem need not be referring to this specific relic or have this incident as the reason for its composition. However, there is a later source that speaks of a bequest made to the 'Holy Cross' at Shaftesbury Abbey in Dorset; Shaftesbury abbey was founded by King Alfred, supported with a large portion of state funds and given to the charge of his own daughter when he was alive - it is conceivable that if Alfred really received this relic, that he may have given it to the care of the nuns at Shaftesbury\n\nMost of the very small relics of the True Cross in Europe came from Constantinople. The city was captured and sacked by the Fourth Crusade in 1204: \"After the conquest of the city Constantinople inestimable wealth was found, incomparably precious jewels and also a part of the cross of the Lord, which Helena transferred from Jerusalem and was decorated with gold and precious jewels. There it attained highest admiration. It was carved up by the present bishops and was divided with other very precious relics among the knights; later, after their return to the homeland, it was donated to churches and monasteries.\" \nA knight Robert de Clari wrote: \"Within this chapel were found many precious relics; for therein were found two pieces of the True Cross, as thick as a man's leg and a fathom in length.\"\n\nBy the end of the Middle Ages so many churches claimed to possess a piece of the True Cross, that John Calvin is famously said to have remarked that there was enough wood in them to fill a ship:\n\nConflicting with this is the finding of Charles Rohault de Fleury, who, in his \"Mémoire sur les instruments de la Passion\" of 1870 made a study of the relics in reference to the criticisms of Calvin and Erasmus. He drew up a catalogue of all known relics of the True Cross showing that, in spite of what various authors have claimed, the fragments of the Cross brought together again would not reach one-third that of a cross which has been supposed to have been in height, with transverse branch of wide, proportions not at all abnormal. He calculated: supposing the Cross to have been of pine-wood (based on his microscopic analysis of the fragments) and giving it a weight of about seventy-five kilogrammes, we find the original volume of the cross to be . The total known volume of known relics of the True Cross, according to his catalogue, amounts to approximately (more specifically 3,942,000 cubic millimetres), leaving a volume of lost, destroyed, or otherwise unaccounted for.\n\nFour cross particles – of ten particles with surviving documentary provenances by Byzantine emperors – from European churches, i.e. Santa Croce in Rome, Notre Dame, Paris, Pisa Cathedral and Florence Cathedral, were microscopically examined. \"The pieces came all together from olive.\" It is possible that many alleged pieces of the True Cross are forgeries, created by travelling merchants in the Middle Ages, during which period a thriving trade in manufactured relics existed.\n\nGerasimos Smyrnakis notes that the largest surviving portion, of 870,760 cubic millimetres, is preserved in the Monastery of Koutloumousiou on Mount Athos, and also mentions the preserved relics in Rome (consisting of 537,587 cubic millimetres), in Brussels (516,090 cubic millimetres), in Venice (445,582 cubic millimetres), in Ghent (436,450 cubic millimetres) and in Paris (237,731 cubic millimetres). (For comparison, the collective volume of the largest of these sets of fragments would be equivalent to a cube of a little less than 4 inches per side, while the smallest of these would have an equivalent cubic dimension of about 2.5 inches per side. The volume figures given by Smyrnakis for these objects—six significant figures and to the cubic millimeter—are undoubtedly the result of multiplying slightly approximate numbers and should not be seen as implying scientific accuracy of the highest order in a book written over a century ago.)\nSanto Toribio de Liébana in Spain is also said to hold the largest of these pieces and is one of the most visited Roman Catholic pilgrimage sites. Other portions of the True Cross are in the Monasterio de Tarlac at San Jose, Tarlac, Philippines and at the National Shrine of Padre Pio of Pietrelcina in San Pedro, Santo Tomas, Batangas, Philippines as well as the Redemptorist Center in Pattaya, Thailand.\n\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church also claims to have the right wing of the true cross buried in the monastery of Gishen Mariam. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has an annual religious holiday, called Meskel or Demera, commemorating the discovery of the True Cross by Queen Helena. Meskel occurs on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or September 28 in leap years). \"Meskel\" (or \"Meskal\" or \"Mesqel\", there are various ways to transliterate from Ge'ez to Latin script) is Ge'ez for \"cross\".\n\nThe festival is known as Feast of the exaltation of the holy cross in other Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant churches. The churches that follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate the feast on September 14.\n\nSaint John Chrysostom wrote homilies on the three crosses:\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and a number of Protestant denominations, celebrate the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross on September 14, the anniversary of the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In later centuries, these celebrations also included commemoration of the rescue of the True Cross from the Persians in 628. In the Galician usage, beginning about the seventh century, the Feast of the Cross was celebrated on May 3. According to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\", when the Galician and Roman practices were combined, the September date, for which the Vatican adopted the official name \"Triumph of the Cross\" in 1963, was used to commemorate the rescue from the Persians and the May date was kept as the \"Invention of the True Cross\" to commemorate the finding. The September date is often referred to in the West as Holy Cross Day; the May date (See also Roodmas.) was dropped from the liturgical calendar of the Roman Catholic Church in 1970 as part of the liturgical reforms mandated by the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965). The Orthodox still commemorate both events on September 14, one of the Twelve Great Feasts of the liturgical year, and the Procession of the Venerable Wood of the Cross on 1 August, the day on which the relics of the True Cross would be carried through the streets of Constantinople to bless the city.\n\nIn addition to celebrations on fixed days, there are certain days of the variable cycle when the Cross is celebrated. The Roman Catholic Church has a formal Adoration of the Cross (the term is inaccurate, but sanctioned by long use) during the services for Good Friday, while Eastern Orthodox churches everywhere, a replica of the cross is brought out in procession during Matins of Great and Holy Friday for the people to venerate. The Orthodox also celebrate an additional Veneration of the Cross on the third Sunday of Great Lent.\n\n\n\n"}

The web sites were operated by cyber criminal organizations to traffic counterfeit credit cards, and false identification information and documents. These websites not only shared information on how to commit fraud, but also provided a forum through which to purchase fraud-related information and tools. \"The network created by the founders of CarderPlanet, including Vladislav Horohorin, remains one of the most sophisticated organizations of online financial criminals in the world,\" said Michael Merritt, Assistant Director for Investigations. \"This network has been repeatedly linked to nearly every major intrusion of financial information reported to the international law enforcement community.

This breach was called the \"Largest known data breach conspiracy ever prosecuted\" by the U.S. Justice Department. As of April 2017, none of Horohorin's co-conspirators had been sentenced.\n\nHorohorin was identified as \"BadB\" in November 2009 in a sealed indictment from the United States attorney's office. He was arrested on August 7, 2010, in Nice, France, while attempting to board an airplane to Warsaw, Poland. However, due to the complexity of the international legal battle that followed his arrest, he was not extradited to the United States until June 6, 2012. During the proceedings in France, Horohorin was incarcerated in the Maison D'Arret D'Aix-Luynes near Aix-en-Provence, France. Horohorin was arraigned on June 7, 2012, and was detained pending trial. \n\nThe Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs handled Horohorin's extradition from France.\n\nThe case was prosecuted by attorneys Ethan Arenson (who later also prosecuted another notorious cyber criminal, Roman Seleznev), Carol Sipperly, and Corbin Weiss of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). The District of Columbia case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service. Assistance was provided by the French Police Nationale Aux Frontiers and the Netherlands Police Agency's National Crime Squad High Tech Crime Unit. The FBI Atlanta Field Office provided information helpful to the investigation.\n\nThe Northern District of Georgia case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick Oldham and Lawrence R. Sommerfeld of the Northern District of Georgia, and trial attorney Sipperly of CCIPS. The Atlanta case was investigated by the FBI.\n\nHorohorin was represented by Arkady L. Bukh during proceedings in the U.S. On October 25, 2012, Horohorin pleaded guilty to two counts of access device fraud as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\n\nOn April 5, 2013, Horohorin was sentenced to serve 88 months in prison for his role in the theft of more than $9 million from RBS Worldpay, (an Atlanta-based credit card processor), and trafficking in millions of stolen credit and debit cards.\n\nIn February 2017, Horohorin was released and was deported from the United States.\n\nThe U.S. assigned two U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to escort Horohorin, while being deported, to Israel, using U.S. airline companies only. Such measures caused Horohorin to be held for what he considered extra time in ICE custody; according to his lawyer, Arkady L. Bukh, \"Horohorin opposed ICE detention fiercely, refusing to stay any extra minute in US and demanding to be deported, claiming that his sentence is finished and offering to pay his own plane tickets\".\n\nHorohorin works as private consultant and security auditor for cybersec.org\n"}

He apprenticed with his father, an English surgeon named Thomas Boylston. He also studied under the Boston physician Dr. Cutler, never attending a formal medical school (the first medical school in North America was not founded until 1765).\n\nBoylston is known for holding several \"firsts\" for an American-born physician: He performed the first surgical operation by an American physician, the first removal of gall bladder stones in 1710, and was the first to remove a breast tumor in 1718.\n\nHe was a great uncle of both president John Adams, and philanthropist Ward Nicholas Boylston.\n\nDuring a smallpox outbreak in 1721 in Boston, he inoculated about 248 people by applying pus from a smallpox sore to a small wound on the subjects, a method said to have been previously used in Africa. Initially, he used the method on two slaves and his own son, who was 13 at the time. This was the first introduction of inoculations to the United States. An African slave named Onesimus taught the idea to Cotton Mather, the influential New England Puritan minister.\n\nHis method was initially met by hostility and outright violence from other physicians, and many threats were made on his life, with some even threatening to hang him on the nearest tree. He was forced to hide in a private place of his house for 14 days, a secret known only by his wife. During this hostility, his family was also in a dangerous situation. His wife and children were sitting in their home and a lighted hand-grenade was thrown into the room, but the fuse fell off before an explosion could take place. Even after the violence had subsided, he visited his patients only at midnight and while disguised. After his initial inoculations of his son and two slaves, he was arrested for a short period of time for it (he was later released with the promise not to inoculate without government permission). In 1724, with a letter of introduction to Dr. James Jurin by Cotton Mather\n, Boylston traveled to London, where he published his results as \"Historical Account of the Small-Pox Inoculated in New England\", and became a fellow of the Royal Society two years later. Afterward, he returned to Boston.\n\n\n\n"}
