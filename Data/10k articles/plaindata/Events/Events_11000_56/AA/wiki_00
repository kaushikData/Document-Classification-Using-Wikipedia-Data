The first severe reports from North Carolina – golf-ball sized hail reports from Macon County, North Carolina also occurred at this time. Severe storms began entering Western South Carolina by mid-afternoon as a high risk was issued for Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, and tornado watches had been issued for most of South Carolina, North Carolina and a portion of Virginia.\n\nUltimately this outbreak was responsible for 57 deaths, 1249 injuries, and confirmed tornado damage in 2 counties in Georgia, 8 counties in South Carolina, and 17 counties in North Carolina, according to data from the National Weather Service and the National Climatic Data Center records and statistical data.\n\nThis was an unusual East Coast outbreak both in its sustained intensity and in some of its meteorological specifics. It was noted by Grazulis and other researchers that this outbreak developed near the center of a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting tornado family, the series of tornadoes in totality is among the longest on record.\n\nThis outbreak was also part of a larger storm system that was responsible for producing severe weather across a much wider area of the eastern U.S. On the previous day, weaker tornadoes had been reported in scattered locations from Louisiana to Alabama, and a thunderstorm-caused flash flood was suspected to be the cause of a train derailment in north Florida. The northern part of the same system first spawned additional severe (non-tornadic) thunderstorms, which caused 4 additional deaths in Maryland and Pennsylvania, before then dropping snow, sleet and ice across a wide area of the northeast. The thunderstorms which produced the tornado outbreak were also responsible (according to the same data) for numerous reports of large hail and wind damage in Appalachian southwest North Carolina, and numerous larger cities (Atlanta, Baltimore, Greenville, South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, Charlotte, North Carolina, Dover, Delaware, Fayetteville, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Raleigh, North Carolina, Suffolk, Virginia, Norfolk, Virginia) at the periphery of the outbreak, with wind damage from thunderstorms reported as far north as Delaware.\n\n\n\n"}

It is a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company of the United States.\n\nIn 1847, Scottish immigrant William Arnott opened a bakery in Morpeth. Later in 1865 he moved to a bakery on Hunter Street, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, providing biscuits and pies to townspeople and ships docking at the local port. Until 1975 the company was under family control with the descendants of William Arnott, including Halse Rogers Arnott and Geoffrey H. Arnott, acting as Chairman. Nephew Aaron Arnott chose not to be involved in the family business and lives in Los Angeles, California in the United States of America.\n\nArnott's, in common with the majority of Australian biscuit manufacturers, operated primarily in its home state, New South Wales, but has manufacturing plants in Virginia, Queensland (manufactures only plain, cream and savory biscuits) and Shepparton, Victoria. In the 1960s, a series of amalgamations and acquisitions in the Australian market resulted in the creation of the Australian Biscuit Company Pty Ltd. This included Arnotts and other companies such as Arnott-Motteram and Menz in South Australia, Brockhoff Biscuit Co. and Guest's Biscuits in Victoria, and Mills and Ware Ltd in Western Australia. The Australian Biscuit Company was later renamed Arnott's Biscuits Pty Ltd. Regional varieties were maintained after these mergers, such as Menz Yo-Yo, Brockhoff Salada and Guest's Teddy Bears.\n\nIn 1997, Arnott's Biscuits was subject to an extortion bid by Queenslander Joy Ellen Thomas, aged 72 years, who allegedly threatened to poison packets of Arnott's Monte Carlo biscuits in South Australia and Victoria. The company conducted a massive recall and publicity campaign, publishing the extortionist's threats and demands in full-page newspaper ads. However, Ms. Thomas was not charged with any offence as the prosecution dropped the case against her because of conflicting evidence. The recall cost the company A$22 million, but Arnott's was praised for its openness and honesty in dealing with the crisis.\n\nIn 1997, the Campbell Soup Company of North America, a shareholder of Arnott's since the 1980s, acquired Arnott's in full. Thus, in 1997, Arnott's Biscuits Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company. This caused a significant amount of controversy in Australia, based on the desire for such an Australian icon to remain in Australian hands, and a fear that Campbell's would Americanise the products.\n\nManufacturing of Arnott's biscuits, however, remained in Australia, and as part of a long-term expansion plan, Arnott's closed its Melbourne factory in September 2002. At the same time, it expanded its facilities in Sydney, Adelaide and Brisbane.\n\nIn 2002, Arnott's acquired Snack Foods Limited. In April 2008, Campbell Arnott's sold Arnott's Snackfoods to The Real McCoy Snackfood Co. and the company is now known as Snack Brands Australia.\n\nArnott's are well known in Australia and internationally for producing several quintessentially Australian biscuits. Some of their major products include:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14544216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14544216", "title": "Court of Augmentations", "text": "Court of Augmentations\n\nThe Court of Augmentations, also called Augmentation Court or simply The Augmentation, was established during the reign of King Henry VIII of England along with three lesser courts (those of General Surveyors, First Fruit and Tenths, and Wards and Liveries) following the dissolution of the monasteries. Its primary function was to gain better control over the land and finances formerly held by the Roman Catholic Church in the kingdom. It was incorporated into the Exchequer in 1554 as the augmentation office.\n\nThe Court of Augmentations was one of a number of financial courts established during Henry's reign. It was founded in 1536 to administer monastic properties and revenues confiscated by the crown at the dissolution of the monasteries. The court had its own chancellor, treasurer, lawyers, receivers and auditors.\n\nIn 1547, the Court of Augmentations was amalgamated with the Court of General Surveyors, which had been established in 1542 to administer crown lands. In 1554, the roles of the Courts of Augmentations, General Surveyors, and First Fruits and Tenths were taken over by the Exchequer.\n\nIn 1536, religious establishments with annual incomes of less than £200 per annum were dissolved. The attention of Henry and his chief minister Thomas Cromwell turned to the friaries in 1537, and thereafter to the rest of the religious houses. By 1540, they had all gone, the last to fall being Waltham Abbey in Essex. Their lands, properties and incomes went to the Crown.\n\nSome of the monastic buildings remained in religious use – Henry allowed some monasteries to be refounded as secular cathedrals served by dean and chapter instead of priors and monks, and in rare cases the church buildings, or parts of them, were bought by locals to act as the parish church. Generally, however, the properties and lands were simply sold off to wealthy lay people, with the Court of Augmentations set up to deal with the spoils.\n\nOn the annexation of the Court of Augmentations to the Exchequer in 1554, the twelve receiverships of land revenues of the counties of England and Wales in the employment of the former were incorporated in the latter. \n\nUntil the Restoration in 1660, appointments were made by the Crown by letters patent under the great seal. Unless otherwise indicated these were for life. While in some cases this practice was followed into the eighteenth century, appointments were increasingly made by other means, for example by letters patent under the seal of the Exchequer, by the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.\n\nParticulars for the sale of a property that came to the Crown at the dissolution of the monasteries were produced by the auditors (who were appraisers) of the Court of Augmentations of the King's Revenue, created in 1536. The particulars would be produced in response to a warrant from the commissioners for the sale of Crown lands. A prospective purchaser of Crown land would return with the auditor's signed particular and have it rated (or reviewed and approved, sometimes with modifications) by the commissioners. The details of the rated particular would form the basis for the warrant authorizing the purchase. Particulars were usually prepared for the actual purchaser of the land. They described the nature of the land, its value, the purchase price and any restrictions on the sale.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "46489586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46489586", "title": "Death of Freddie Gray", "text": "Death of Freddie Gray\n\nOn April 12, 2015, Freddie Carlos Gray, Jr., a 25-year-old African American man, was arrested by the Baltimore Police Department for possessing what the police alleged was an illegal knife under Baltimore law. While being transported in a police van, Gray fell into a coma and was taken to a trauma center. Gray died on April 19, 2015; his death was ascribed to injuries to his spinal cord. On April 21, 2015, pending an investigation of the incident, six Baltimore police officers were suspended with pay.\n\nThe circumstances of the injuries were initially unclear; eyewitness accounts suggested that the officers involved used unnecessary force against Gray during the arrest—a claim denied by all officers involved. Commissioner Anthony W. Batts reported that, contrary to department policy, the officers did not secure him inside the van while driving to the police station; this policy had been put into effect six days prior to Gray's arrest, following review of other transport-related injuries sustained during police custody in the city, and elsewhere in the country during the preceding years. The medical investigation found that Gray had sustained the injuries while in transport. The medical examiner's office concluded that Gray's death could not be ruled an accident, and was instead a homicide, because officers failed to follow safety procedures \"through acts of omission.\" On May 1, 2015, the Baltimore City State's Attorney, Marilyn Mosby, announced her office had filed charges against six police officers after the medical examiner's report ruled Gray's death a homicide.\n\nThe prosecutors stated that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six police officers who were believed to be involved in his death. The officer driving the van was charged with second-degree \"depraved-heart\" murder for his indifference to the considerable risk that Gray might be killed, and others were charged with crimes ranging from manslaughter to illegal arrest. On May 21, a grand jury indicted the officers on most of the original charges filed by Mosby with the exception of the charges of illegal imprisonment and false arrest, and added charges of reckless endangerment to all the officers involved.\n\nGray's hospitalization and subsequent death resulted in an ongoing series of protests. On April 25, 2015, a major protest in downtown Baltimore turned violent, resulting in 34 arrests and injuries to 15 police officers. After Gray's funeral on April 27, civil disorder intensified with looting and burning of local businesses and a CVS drug store, culminating with a state of emergency declaration by Governor Larry Hogan, Maryland National Guard deployment to Baltimore, and the establishment of a curfew. On May 3, the National Guard started withdrawing from Baltimore, and the night curfew on the city was lifted.\n\nIn September 2015, it was decided that there would be separate trials for the accused. The trial against Officer William Porter ended in mistrial. Officers Nero, Goodson, and Rice were found not guilty at trial. The remaining charges against the officers were dropped on July 27, 2016.\n\nOn September 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it would not bring federal charges against the six Baltimore police officers involved in the arrest and in-custody death of Freddie Gray. However, it was announced on October 5, 2017 that non-criminal, internal disciplinary trials for the officers will be prosecuted by a three person-panel chaired by someone from another Maryland police agency, likely Prince George's County, and that outside lawyer and former chair of the Baltimore City School Board Neil Duke will serve on the panel as well.\n\nFreddie Carlos Gray, Jr. (August 16, 1989 – April 19, 2015) was the 25-year-old son of Gloria Darden. He had a twin sister, Fredericka Gray, as well as another sister, Carolina. At the time of his death, Gray lived in the home owned by his sisters in the Gilmor Homes neighborhood. He stood and weighed . Gray had a criminal record, on drug charges and minor crimes and had spent time in jail.\n\n\nPolice encountered Freddie Gray on the morning of April 12, 2015, in the street near Baltimore's Gilmor Homes housing project, an area known to have high levels of home foreclosures, poverty, drug deals and violent crime. Approximately three weeks prior to the incident, Mosby had requested \"enhanced\" drug enforcement efforts at the corner of North and Mount. According to the charging documents submitted by the Baltimore police, at 8:39 a.m Lieutenant Brian W. Rice, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Garrett E. Miller were patrolling on bicycles and made eye contact with Gray, who proceeded to flee on foot \"unprovoked upon noticing police presence\". After a brief chase, Gray was apprehended and taken into custody \"without the use of force or incident\", according to Officer Garret Miller, who wrote he \"noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his [Gray's] front right pocket\". In the formal statement of charges, Officer Miller stated that Gray \"did unlawfully carry, possess, and sell a knife commonly known as a switch blade knife, with an automatic spring or other device for opening and/or closing the blade within the limits of Baltimore City. The knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted one hand operated knife.\" According to the state's attorney for Baltimore City, the spring-assisted knife Gray was carrying was legal under Maryland law, while a police task force said the knife was a violation of the Baltimore code under which Gray was charged.\n\nVideo recordings by two bystanders capturing Gray's arrest showed Gray, screaming, being dragged to a police van by officers, and then stepping up into the van. A bystander with connections to Gray stated that the officers were previously \"folding\" Gray: one officer bent Gray's legs backwards, and another held Gray down by pressing a knee into his neck. Witnesses commented Gray \"couldn't walk\", \"can't use his legs\", and \"his leg look broke and you all dragging him like that\". Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts noted from the video that, \"Gray stood on one leg and climbed into the van on his own.\" \"The Baltimore Sun\" reported that another witness saw Gray being beaten with police batons.\n\nAccording to the police timeline, Gray was placed in a transport van within 11 minutes of his arrest, and within 30 minutes, paramedics were summoned to take Gray to a hospital. The van made four confirmed stops while Gray was detained. At 8:46 a.m., Gray was unloaded in order to be placed in leg irons because police said he was acting irate. Gray's shackling was recorded on a cellphone, which exhibited a motionless Gray surrounded by several officers as he was restrained. A later stop, recorded by a private security camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59 a.m., a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray's condition. At 9:24 a.m., the transport van arrived at its final stop, the West District police station. After paramedics treated Gray for 21 minutes, he was taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center at 9:45 a.m. in a coma.\n\nThe media has suggested the possibility of a rough ride—an unsanctioned practice where a handcuffed prisoner is placed without a seatbelt in an erratically driven vehicle—as a contributing factor in Gray's injury. During Officer Goodson's trial, a prosecution witness testified that he \"could not say\" if there had been a rough ride, and the judge ruled that the prosecution had not presented evidence to back that assumption.\n\nThe department's seatbelt policy had been revised six days prior to Gray's arrest, in an attempt to protect detained individuals from serious injuries during transport. The policy was not followed in Gray's case. According to attorney Michael Davey, who represents at least one of the officers under investigation, the new rules were criticized by some. He explained that in certain situations, like when a prisoner is combative, \"It is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small, and this one was very small.\"\n\nIn the following week, according to the Gray family attorney, Gray suffered from total cardiopulmonary arrest at least once but was resuscitated without ever regaining consciousness. He remained in a coma, and underwent extensive surgery in an effort to save his life. According to his family, he lapsed into a coma with three fractured vertebrae, injuries to his voice box, and his spine 80% severed at his neck. Police confirmed that the spinal injury led to Gray's death. Gray died on April 19, 2015, a week after his arrest.\n\nThe Baltimore Police Department suspended six officers with pay pending an investigation of Gray's death. The six officers involved in the arrest were identified as Lieutenant Brian Rice, Sergeant Alicia White, Officer William Porter, Officer Garrett Miller, Officer Edward Nero, and Officer Caesar Goodson. On April 24, 2015, Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" Batts also acknowledged police did not follow procedure when they failed to buckle Gray in the van while he was being transported to the police station. The U.S. Department of Justice also opened an investigation into the case.\n\nOn April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, one of the witnesses who filmed Gray's arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following what Moore described as \"harassment and intimidation\" by police. Moore stated he had cooperated with police, and gave over his video of Gray's arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police, who asked the public to identify him because he was \"wanted for questioning.\" Moore said the police obviously knew who he was when they posted his photo. Moore was released from custody the next day, but two other individuals who were arrested along with Moore remained in custody. The same day as Moore's arrest, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of slamming into the inside of the transport van, \"apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van\".\n\nOn May 19, 2015, prosecutors asked a judge to place a gag order on attorneys, police, and witnesses of the arrest, arguing that statements by the attorneys of some of the officers charged could prejudice the public. On June 8, 2015, it was announced that a judge had denied the state's attorney's request for a gag order on procedural grounds.\n\nOn May 1, 2015, after receiving a medical examiner's report ruling Gray's death a homicide, state prosecutors said that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Mosby said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that \"No crime had been committed\" (by Freddie Gray). Mosby said that Gray \"suffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon\". Mosby said officers had \"failed to establish probable cause for Mr. Gray's arrest, as no crime had been committed\", and charged officers with false imprisonment, because Gray was carrying a pocket knife of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest. All six officers were taken into custody and processed at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.\n\nThree of the officers faced manslaughter charges and one faced an additional count of second degree depraved-heart murder. The murder charge carries a possible penalty of 30 years in prison; the manslaughter and assault offenses carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. All six officers were released from jail after posting bail the same day they were booked. Two officers were released on $250,000 bail and the four others' bail was $350,000.\nOn September 2, 2015, it was decided to hold separate trials for the accused.\n\nIn December 2015, a Baltimore judge declared a mistrial in the trial of Officer Porter after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.\n\nIn May 2016, a Baltimore judge declared Officer Nero not guilty by means of a bench trial.\n\nOn June 23, 2016, Officer Caesar Goodson was acquitted of all charges by Circuit Judge Barry Williams.\n\nIn June 2016, law professor John Banzhaf of George Washington University filed a complaint with the bar against Marilyn Mosby for prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nIn January 2017, a federal judge allowed a lawsuit by five of the six police officers unsuccessfully charged by Mosby. Mosby was being sued for malicious prosecution, defamation, and invasion of privacy.\n\nMayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said there was no place in the Baltimore Police department for those police officers who \"choose to engage in violence, brutality, [and] racism\". Gene Ryan, president of the police union chapter said that despite the tragic situation, \"none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.\"\n\nPresident Barack Obama said it was vital that the truth be found and supported protests if they were peaceful.\n\nIn a May 4, 2015, interview on \"Fox News\", Alan Dershowitz said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances. Former Baltimore Prosecutor Page Croyder penned an op-ed in \"The Baltimore Sun\" where she described Mosby's charges as reflecting \"either incompetence or an unethical recklessness\". Croyder opined that Mosby circumvented normal procedures \"to step into the national limelight\", and that she \"pandered to the public\", creating an expectation of a conviction.\n\nA motion for Mosby to recuse herself from the case was filed on behalf of the charged officers, on the alleged basis of personal gain by Mosby and her husband, personal relationships with potential witnesses, and the financial interest of Gray's attorney, who the motion claims is a close friend of Mosby. CNN's legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin pointed out that he does not see any serious conflict of interest to disqualify Mosby from the case, and that the officers may not have a case with that motion. The lawyers representing the officers filed a motion insisting that the city must pay thousands of dollars in damages for arresting and detaining them—or else they could sue Mosby and the Mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. In a 11-page rebuttal, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow wrote that Gray was detained \"well before the arresting officers knew he possessed a knife\" and that the motion was absurdly \"bounc[ing] from one ridiculous allegation to another, like a pinball on a machine far past 'TILT. Mosby was ordered to respond to the motion filed by the defense attorneys by June 26, 2015.\n\nPorter met up with the van after Goodson called dispatchers to ask for an officer to come check on Gray. He was requested twice by Gray for a medic, but did not call for one. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; misconduct in office. Porter posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Porter on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. On December 16, 2015, a mistrial was declared on all charges, after the jury was hung and could not come to a decision. Porter's second trial was scheduled for June 13, 2016. Analysts stated that the Porter's retrial could have caused problems for the other trials, under the presumption that he could not be compelled to testify while there are pending charges against him. After several appeals and reversals, the Maryland Court of Appeals ruled that Porter would be required to testify in the cases against the other officers. Officer Porter's retrial date was originally scheduled for September 6, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against him were dropped.\n\nThe driver of the van. He was charged with second-degree depraved heart murder; involuntary manslaughter; second-degree assault; manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence); manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence); and misconduct in office. He posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted Goodson on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. Officer Goodson was found not guilty on all charges by Circuit Judge Barry Williams on June 23, 2016.\n\nThe officers who caught Gray after he fled, and, after apprehending him, handcuffed Gray with his arms behind his back. Miller was charged with two counts of second degree assault; two counts of misconduct in office; and false imprisonment. Nero was charged with two counts of second degree assault; misconduct in office and false imprisonment. Each posted a 250,000 bail. The false imprisonment charges were dropped by the grand jury, but an indictment of reckless endangerment was added. Judge Williams found Officer Nero not guilty of all charges on May 23, 2016. Officer Miller's trial date was set for July 27, 2016. At his pretrial hearing on July 27, 2016, however, all charges against Miller and officers Porter and White were dropped.\n\nThe officer who initially made eye contact with Gray while on a bicycle patrol. He was charged with involuntary manslaughter; two counts of second degree assault; manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence); two counts of misconduct in office; and false imprisonment. He posted a 350,000 bail. The false imprisonment charges were dropped by the grand jury, which added an indictment of reckless endangerment. Judge Williams dropped one of the assault charges after the prosecution rested, ruling there was not enough evidence to prove second-degree assault. Lt. Rice's trial began July 7, 2016. Rice was found not guilty on all counts by Judge Barry Williams on July 18, 2016.\n\nWhite is accused of not calling for medical assistance when she encountered Gray, \"despite the fact she was advised that he needed a medic\". She was charged with involuntary manslaughter; second degree assault; and misconduct. She posted a 350,000 bail. The grand jury indicted White on all charges and added an indictment of reckless endangerment. Sgt. White's trial date was originally set for October 13, 2016. On July 27, 2016, all charges against her were dropped.\n\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch announced on , 2015, that the Department of Justice would conduct a review of the current practices of Baltimore Police Department on account of the \"serious erosion of public trust\" in relation to the circumstances of Gray's death. The review took effect immediately, and focused on allegations that Baltimore police officers use excessive force, including deadly force, conduct unlawful searches, seizures or arrests, and engage in discriminatory policing.\n\n, Federal authorities were conducting three probes into Baltimore police, the \"pattern of practice\" investigation initiated by Lynch, a collaborative review that began in the fall of 2014, and a civil rights probe into the death of Gray.\n\nOn September 12, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it will not bring federal charges against the six Baltimore police officers involved in the arrest and in-custody death of Freddie Gray.\n\nPublic reaction to the death has drawn further parallels to the response to the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown, as part of a larger string of controversial uses of force by police officers in the United States against African Americans. , 22 demonstrations had been held nationwide in direct response to Gray's death or in solidarity with Baltimore. Additionally, the Black Lives Matter movement has protested Gray's death.\n\nOn April 18, 2015, hundreds of people participated in a protest outside the Baltimore Police Department. Three days later, on April 21, 2015, according to Reuters, \"[h]undreds of demonstrators gathered in Baltimore\", protesting Gray's death. The next day, Gene Ryan, the president of the local lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, expressed sympathy for the Gray family, but criticized the \"rhetoric of protests\" and suggested that \"the images seen on television look and sound much like a lynch mob\". William Murphy, attorney for the Gray family, demanded an \"immediate apology and a retraction\". Ryan defended his statement two days later, while admitting that the wording was poor. Charles M. Blow of \"The New York Times\", reminded of a column he wrote several years ago, said that comparing protests to lynch mobs was too extreme because it inflames racial tensions by belittling the significance of the history of lynching in the United States.\n\nOn April 25, 2015, protests were organized in downtown Baltimore, and the protests turned violent as protesters threw rocks and set fires. Many protesters were angered students after being removed from their primary mode of transportation (city buses) and told to disperse from the city. Tension between the riot police and students grew as time passed, eventually leading to bottles and bricks thrown in protest of the large police presence of a so far peaceful protest of Gray's death At least 34 people were arrested, and 15 officers were injured. On April 27, rioting and looting began after the funeral of Gray, with two patrol cars destroyed and 15 officers reported injured. Protesters looted and burned down a CVS Pharmacy location in downtown Baltimore. In reaction to the unrest, the Maryland State Police sent 82 troopers to protect the city. A Baltimore Orioles baseball game against the Chicago White Sox scheduled for the evening was postponed due to the unrest. The next game commenced as scheduled but, as a precautionary measure, the match was played behind closed doors. The next series against the Tampa Bay Rays was moved to St. Petersburg. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency, and activated the Maryland National Guard. Hogan also activated 500 state troopers for duty in Baltimore and requested an additional 5,000 police officers from other locales.\n\nAt a press conference, Baltimore's mayor announced there would be a citywide curfew from 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. School trips were canceled until mid-May, and Baltimore's city schools were closed on April 28. In addition, both the University of Maryland campus in downtown Baltimore and the Mondawmin Mall were closed early.\n\nProtests outside Baltimore also took place in other U.S. cities. In New York City, 143 people at Union Square were arrested on April 29, 2015 for blocking traffic and refusing to relocate. On the same day, outside the White House in Washington, D.C., nearly 500 protesters converged without an incident. In Denver, eleven people were arrested as protesters were involved in physical altercations with officers. Other protests in response to Gray's death took place in cities including Chicago, Minneapolis, Miami, Philadelphia, Portland, and Seattle.\n\nOn May 3, 2015, the National Guard began withdrawing from Baltimore, and the night curfew on the city was lifted. The demobilizing process lasted three days, during which time the state of emergency remained in effect.\n\nIn May 2015, there were 43 homicides in Baltimore, making it the deadliest month in 40 years behind August 1972 (45 homicides) and December 1971 (44 homicides). The number of homicides fell to 29 in June 2015 but in July 2015, 45 murders were recorded, tying with the record in 1972. Lt. Gene Ryan, president of Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police, said this was partly due to an increase of confidence among criminals in Baltimore. Then-police commissioner, Anthony Batts, blamed drugs looted from pharmacies during the riots for the spike in crime.\n\nThe 2015 homicide total as of July 31 was 189 compared to 119 by the end of July 2014. On August 3, in an attempt to solve the cases, Baltimore announced the Baltimore Federal Homicide Task Force. It is a partnership of the Baltimore police and five federal crime-fighting agencies. The agencies will each embed two agents with the Baltimore police to help investigate. On July 8, 2015, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake fired Anthony Batts, saying that his response to the death of Gray had become a distraction, while the police failed to prevent the spike in homicides.\n\nBaltimore ended the year with 344 homicides, the second-highest total behind 1993, when 353 murders occurred. It was also the first time since 1999 that the city recorded at least 300 homicides within a calendar year.\n\nOn September 8, 2015, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that the city had reached a $6.4 million settlement with Gray's family. Rawlings-Blake said the settlement \"should not be interpreted as a judgment on the guilt or innocence of the officers facing trial\", but had been negotiated to avoid \"costly and protracted litigation that would only make it more difficult for our city to heal\". The city offered a settlement before they were sued.\n\nOn July 27, 2016, prosecutors dropped the remaining charges against the three remaining officers.\n\nThe death of Gray has been the subject of several songs. Prince recorded a song called \"Baltimore\" for his 2015 album \"Hit n Run Phase Two\". The music video featured scenes from protests in response to Gray's death. In May 2015, Salomon Faye released \"Black Power\", a music video on YouTube that shows rallies in the aftermath of Gray's death. Dru Hill dedicated their 2016 song \"Change\" to Gray. In 2016, Kevin Morby released \"Beautiful Strangers\", which addressed issues plaguing the world: gun violence, the death of Freddie Gray, and attacks in Orlando and Paris. In 2017, jazz pianist Lafayette Gilchrist released a song called \"Blues For Freddie Gray\" on his \"New Urban World Blues\" record. Later the same year, singer-songwriter Eliot Bronson penned \"Rough Ride\", a song about Gray.\n\nIn 2017, HBO produced \"Baltimore Rising\", a documentary about Gray's death and the subsequent protests. Directed by Sonja Sohn, it charts the impact of the incident on the people of Baltimore. In May 2018, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks released a song entitled \"Bike Lane\" on their \"Sparkle Hard\" album. The song references the Freddie Gray case.\n\n\n"}

In 1996, work to remodel and expansion of the theatre (under architect Luís Faro Viana), a project financed partially by the Ministry of Culture for 390,000 contos. Between 1996 and 1999, there were further projects to bring the theatre up to code, that included lighting, roofing, consolidation of walls, installation of fire safety equipment and construction of handicap accessways. At the same time, the stage was expanded, along with the mezzanine and booth seating.\n\nThe Teatro Diogo Bernardes became the home of the Ponte de Lima Festival of Opera and Classical Music.\n\nThe theatre is flanked and integrated into the centre of the town in an area of paved stonework and granite structure, behind the Church of Santo António dos Capuchos, near the Lima River and along the \"Avenida dos Plátanos\". The principal facade is preceded by a platform of granite slabs accessible by three stairs, and flanked by two iron gates between granite pilasters.\n\nThe longitudinal plan is composed of two rectangular wings, with one higher than the other, with a \"L\"-shaped section addorsed in the northeast and northwest, covered in differentiated tiles and metal sheeting. The facades are decorated and painted white, encircled by salient cornice. On the southeast facade it is crowned by a cornice with geometric motifs in relief and decorated by statute of Melpômene over acrotary, with the inscription: \"1893 / THEATRO DIOGO BERNARDES\". This facade includes three sections, structured by overlapping pilasters, with the central three sections with archway over pilasters with cornice. It forms a flag and window over pilasters, decorated with curvilinear frontispiece with tympanium. The lateral sections with similar door frame and window, also over pilasters is decorated in cornice and ovular oculus. Over the doorways to the entrance is a window and iron grating, with metallic mantle in geometric decoration. The lateral facades, which continues the same motifs, are marked by an elevated tower structure, and includes rounded doorways with windows. The principal facade, which is partially covered, in the northeast by annex, includes two storeys with windows and decorated with plaques of granite along the foundations. Below this is an iron gateway, with access to the patio of the warehouse. The rear facade with small gabled window is reinforced by a counterweight system that consisted of large metal beams and concrete.\n\nThe interior of the structure includes two large atriums, decorated and painted white, with mosaic ceramic pavements forming an encased motif with entranceway presenting two allusive tile panels, recovered from the original construction. The atriums had two large rounded doors with windows that connect them to the spaces, backstage, ticket office, seating, and cafeteria on the first floor, in addition to dressing rooms. Following a wood staircase to the second floor provides accesses to balcony and mezzanine, accessed by corridors of plastered white walls. The main auditorium, with a horseshoe plan, is surrounded by three floors of balconies, in a bow shape with carved motifs and wooden curved guardrails. It is covered by a domed stucco roof, with a central carton, circular, ornamented, laced with phytomorphic themes.\n\n"}
{"id": "22102295", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22102295", "title": "Disaster draft", "text": "Disaster draft\n\nA disaster draft or contingency draft is a disaster recovery plan developed by professional sports leagues to rebuild a team's roster if many players are disabled or killed.\n\nSince the advent of modern mass transportation, there have been accidents that killed all or nearly all members of various sports teams. The 1949 Torino Football Club had only one survivor following a plane crash. Two teams in the Canadian Football League lost players, returning from an all-star game, in the 1956 crash of Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810.\n\nOther air incidents since then have involved the 1958 Manchester United football team, 1960 Cal Poly football team, (no fatalities), 1961 United States figure skating team, 1970 Wichita State University football team, 1970 Marshall University football team, 1977 University of Evansville basketball team, 1980 United States boxing team, 1993 Zambia national football team, 2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team, and the 2016 Associação Chapecoense de Futebol team (Brasil).\n\nAs a result of these accidents, some professional sports leagues have developed disaster recovery plans should such an incident befall one or more of their teams.\n\nAn affected team is expected to replace players using the minor leagues and by signing free agents. Each league, however, has established procedures to decide whether an accident is of sufficient scale to activate contingency plans to help rebuild an affected team's roster, typically involving a special draft.\n\nMajor League Baseball's disaster plan is covered in Rule 29 of its official rules.\nThe plan is triggered by an event causing the death, dismemberment, or permanent disability of at least five players from a team's active, disabled, or suspended roster during a season (including the playoffs), or at least six players during the off-season. Major League Baseball's commissioner will decide if the disabled club can continue play, in consultation with the MLB Players' Association and the club.\n\nIf the commissioner decides that the disabled club will continue to play, the commissioner may hold a Restocking Draft to allow the disabled club to select as many players as it lost, with the restriction that no more than one player can be selected from each team. Each of the non-disabled teams makes five players available for the draft taken from its active list (or if during the off-season, from its reserve list), composed of one pitcher, one catcher, one outfielder, one infielder, and one more player of any position, subject to adjustments by the commissioner based on the players lost by the disabled club. If a team has fewer than three eligible catchers, it does not have to provide a catcher to the draft. The non-disabled teams also are required to make available as many players with 60 or more days of Major League service time as of 31 August of the season preceding such draft as the number of such players lost by the disabled team. Any player with no-trade rights with regards to the disabled team may not be made available unless the player waives the right.\n\nIf the commissioner decides that the disabled club cannot continue play, the commissioner will cancel the disabled club's season.\n\nThe commissioner and Players' Association can also agree upon other appropriate relief for a disabled club.\n\nMajor League Baseball's first expansion drafts of the early 1960s were based largely on the procedures first set out for the disaster draft.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) contingency plan activates if five or more players on a team \"die or are dismembered\". A special \"disaster draft\" would be held in which other NBA teams could only protect five players, so that quality sixth men would be available. No more than one player would be drafted from a team.\n\nThe National Football League (NFL)'s contingency plan provides for both a \"near-disaster\" and a \"disaster\". A \"near-disaster\" is defined as fewer than 15 players on a team being disabled, and a \"disaster\" is 15 or more.\n\nNo special draft would be held for a \"near-disaster\"; the team would instead get preferential rights on any waivers until the end of the season. If a quarterback is among the fewer than 15 lost, the team would be able to draft up to two quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each team would be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.\n\nFor a \"disaster\", the commissioner would determine whether to cancel the team's schedule for the season. If the team's season is canceled, the team would have the first pick in the next regular draft; a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players. If not canceled, the \"near-disaster\" procedures would be used.\n\nThe National Hockey League (NHL) contingency plan activates if five or more players on a team \"are killed or disabled\". The team would select players from other NHL teams, paying with funds from a special insurance fund. Once its roster has one goaltender and 14 other players, a special draft involving the teams unaffected by the earlier selection could be held, with each team able to protect one goaltender and 10 other players.\n\nWithin its roster regulations, Major League Soccer has what it refers to as an \"extreme hardship\" provision, which can be used if \"a team has less than 15 available players\". However, this is a mechanism intended to be used on a \"game-by-game basis\", and any contingency plans that may exist for a disaster draft scenario are not public.\n\nThe Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) contingency plan was implemented after the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash that killed the team's entire traveling roster. In the policy, each team makes three players eligible for the disaster draft, with the team that suffered the disaster being able to call up five players from its farm teams. There is no mention of a goaltender minimum for the draft, unlike the NFL disaster draft on quarterbacks or NHL disaster draft on goaltenders, or a mention of a team being able to surrender only one player, unlike other leagues, in the draft. The afflicted team will have a spot in the draft lottery, thus guaranteeing that the team will pick at least as high as 4th overall in the next KHL Junior Draft and it will also be able to protect any player it wants for the next five entry drafts.\n"}

{"id": "7541956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7541956", "title": "FIA Sportscar Championship", "text": "FIA Sportscar Championship\n\nThe FIA Sportscar Championship was a sports car racing series created by John Mangoletsi and was eventually taken control of by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It was a series similar to the FIA GT Championship, concentrating on two classes of open-cockpit sports prototypes in endurance races mostly around Europe. The series was folded after the 2003 season.\n\nFollowing the demise of the World Sportscar Championship in 1992, Europe was left without a major sportscar series. In the United States however, attempts were underway to recreate the glory of the World Sportscar Championship with the IMSA GTP series returning to cheaper, open-cockpit sportscars to replace their highly technological and expensive closed-cockpit sportscars that were similar to those used in the World Sportscar Championship at its end. Following on this successful formula, in 1997 John Mangoletsi developed the International Sports Racing Series, a European-based series for open-cockpit sportscars. It would be supported by major teams like Rafanelli, Riley & Scott, Kremer Racing, Joest Racing and Konrad Motorsport and by manufacturers such as Ferrari, which was having success with its new 333 SP sports racer.\n\nThe International Sports Racing Series was open to Sportscars complying with either FIA SR1 or FIA SR2 regulations. The SR1 class was for cars with engines limited to a maximum capacity of 6000cc if naturally aspirated or 4000cc if supercharged. The SR2 class was for cars with production based engines limited to a maximum of six cylinders and a maximum capacity of 3000cc. The SR1 cars were similar to those contesting the LMP Class in the 24 Hours of Le Mans while the SR2 cars were similar to cars in the CN class as used in hillclimb events. In 1999, the series was officially recognized by the FIA and renamed the Sports Racing World Cup. Ferrari's success with the 333SP was proven with a large number of entrants making it the chassis of choice in SR1, while Riley & Scott, Lola, and other manufacturers attempted to overcome the dominant marque, Ferrari.\n\nIn 2001, the series was officially taken over by the FIA and renamed as the FIA Sportscar Championship and it continued to expand into new markets, including a partnership with Grand American in the United States. This partnership involved share races and, eventually, common regulations. With the creation of the American Le Mans Series in 1999 and the European Le Mans Series in 2001, the FIA Sportscar Championship found it increasingly difficult to attract top teams and manufacturers. Grand American changed to adapt to this shift in sportscar design with their dropping of the SRP1 class and the phasing out of the SRP2 class (eliminated in 2004) in 2003. By that time the FIA Sportscar Championship was suffered from a declining number of entries, leading to its demise at the end of the 2003 season. The FIA chose instead to back the new Le Mans Endurance Series that debuted in 2004, ensuring the continuation of Sportscar racing in Europe.\n\n\n"}

Although lacking the liturgical importance of the pilgrim festivals related to the harvest of cereals at the beginning of the agricultural season or to the harvest of grapes and the ingathering of fruits at the end of the period, the shearing of the sheep was, nonetheless, a memorable convivium that brought together people of different localities to enjoy banquets \"fit for royalty\".

The festival is held to promote the cultural traditions, and developments, of the Celtic nations (países celtes in Asturias), especially music and dance, as well as painting, photography, theatre, sculpture, traditional craftsmanship, sport and gastronomy. It is organized by the \"Cultural Association Esbardu\", located in Avilés.\n\nThe idea of a festival in Avilés arose after the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in 1993 when members of Esbardu took part in that festival. They started working on a similar (although smaller) idea in Avilés. In the summer of 1997 the project received a small budget from the Asturian regional government and another one from Avilés Town Hall. The festival was held again in the following year.\n\nIn 2006, 1,175 people took part in the festival with 150 acts and performances over eleven days. There were 800 musicians, dancers and actors in the parade. In 2008 it was officially named by the Regional Authorities of the Principality of Asturies, as the \"Fiesta de Interés Turístico Regional\"(Celebration of Regional Tourist Interest).\nIn 2010 choirs from Wales participated in the festival, namely The Port Talbot Cymric Male Choir and Cor Meibion Y Fflint (Flint Male Voice Choir). The 'Cymric' as it is known, was the first Welsh male voice choir to perform at the 'Festival Interceltique de Lorient' and performed again in 1978. The choir was again invited to Lorient in 1992. Flint have appeared at Lorient five times as well as Interceltic Festivals in Nantes and Paris. They were winners of the Male Voice Choir competition in the 2007 \"Côr Cymru\", and finalists again in 2009.\n\nThe festival takes place in the Comarca de Avilés, in Asturias, between Cabo Peñas and the mouth of the Nalón river. Avilés, Castrillón, Corvera and Illas are the members of the \"Comarca\".\n\nFrom 18 to 27 July 2008, the festival was held in Avilés and Comarca.\n\"Las Noches Célticas\" (The Celtic Nights):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants in the 11th festival included \n\n\n"}

The Festival also serves as the annual conference of the member choirs of AICSA, the Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association\n\nThe festival is hosted by the AICSA choirs in a particular city on a rotational basis, the roster being maintained by AICSA's governing body, the Australian Intervarsity Choral Council (AIVCC). Most IVCFs have involved between 100 and 300 festival participants (choristers), who perform one to three concerts over the course of about two weeks, often accompanied by a major symphonic orchestra.\n\nAn example is the festival in 2008. IVCF was hosted by the Sydney University Musical Society in association with other university choirs including Macquarie University Singers, and the Music Society of the University of Technology (Sydney), and performed a concert of English works including Thomas Tallis' 40-part motet \"Spem in Alium\" and Ralph Vaughan Williams' \"Serenade to Music\", and one of Australian works including a commission from Anne Boyd (see Promotion of Australian Composition below).\n\n\nThe first Australian InterVarsity Choral Festival took place in 1950 when the Sydney University Musical Society (SUMS) hosted the Melbourne University Choral Society (MUCS) for a week-long rehearsal camp culminating in a combined concert. Other university choirs joined over the years, with all State and Territory capitals (except Darwin in the Northern Territory) having at least one member choir by 1973. The IVCF has since become the largest regularly occurring choral festival in Australia.\n\nFrom 1975 on, when the 26th IVCF performed Verdi's \"Requiem\" in the then recently opened Sydney Opera House, IVCFs have striven to perform large-scale works to high standards with professional orchestras where appropriate and available. The 37th IVCF (Brisbane, 1986) was the first to work with its state's peak professional orchestra, the then Queensland Symphony Orchestra, the major work on the program being Herbert Howells' \"Hymnus Paradisi\". Two years later (1988), to celebrate Australia's bicentennial, the 39th IVCF collaborated with the Sydney Philharmonia and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Charles Dutoit to perform Mahler's Symphony number 8 (\"Symphony of a Thousand\"), again in the Sydney Opera House.\n\nMore recently, the 55th IVCF (Perth, 2004) took part in the Perth International Arts Festival to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of Antonín Dvořák by performing his Stabat Mater with the Prague Chamber Orchestra under Australian conductor Graham Abbott.\n\nIVCFs have a long if intermittent tradition of performance of works by Australian composers. At least sixteen performances since 1962 have included works commissioned by the festival, including \"Blue Gum Forest\", composed by Matthew Orlovich for the 60th IVCF in 2009, \"Missa Pacifica\" by Anne Boyd, commissioned for the Sydney IVCF in 2008, and David Cassat's \"Flesh to Stone\" for semichorus and divisi main chorus, commissioned by the 56th IVCF (Melbourne) in 2005.\n\nMany other InterVarsity Choral Festivals have included premiere performances of works, including Paul Stanhope's \"Pirramimma\" for three choirs and string ensemble, performed in 2007 in Brisbane through a collaboration between the 58th IVCF and the Bonyi International Youth Festival.\n\nThe organization behind the IVCF is the Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association (AICSA), which is a non-profit that represents each of the affiliated local choirs, with a purpose of encouraging choral music within tertiary academic settings. While officially formed in 1973, organizational cooperation to create the IVCF has existed since 1950. Since being officially formed, AICSA has acquired an increased role. Today, besides assisting in the organisation of the festival, it sponsors a database catalogue of music held by individual choirs, archives at the National Library of Australia, and internet resources via aicsa.org.au. The newsletter \"Erato\" was published 3-5 times a year from 1971 to 2012.\n\nAs of September 2012, member societies were:\n\n\n"}

The duo are film faculty members at the University. In addition to students and film buffs from all over India, the festival is attended by the who's who of this scenic hill station: theatre artistes, cinematographers, filmmakers, and state and union ministers.\n\n\nKamaun University in the year 2016 initiated a few unconventional courses; filmmaking was one among them. The film faculty comprised Rajesh Shah, a Mumbai-based cinematographer who had returned to his home in the hills to dedicate his time to teaching, along with his wife, National Film Award-winning documentary filmmaker Shalini Shah. Before the end of the year, the duo along with their first batch of 14 students decided to host a tiny student film festival. It was organised by CEFM–The Hermitage, Kumaun University, in association with HIMACEEF.\n\nThe inaugural edition was a success and the second edition, was immensely scaled up: it ran for 10 days in all, included a 5-day FTII film appreciation camp, was international and competitive, and featured a Film Critics Circle of India citation.\n\nExpanding further, the next edition is planned to be in association with major Indian short & docu film festivals, and film societies; and to include Audience Choice Awards, a hands-on film workshop, and a Docu & Short Fiction Film Market. Speaking on the occasion, Ministers pledged to urge the government to fund future editions of the festival.\n\nAt the first edition, in April 2017, in addition to the film screenings, open forum sessions and informal masterclasses were conducted by film industry members, including cinematographer Kamaljeet Negi; actor Lalit Mohan Tiwari; Rajeev Katiyar, director of Films Division; film critic/essayist Dalton L, representing the Film Critics Circle of India; and Bhupendra Kainthola, director of FTII-Pune.\n\nAt the second edition, in April 2018, FTII conducted an intense 5-day film appreciation camp that was attended by 91 participants—ranging in age from 15-year-old school students to a 72-year-old retired professor—hailing from 10 states, namely, Uttarakhand (Nainital, Dehradun, Haldwani, Khatima, Almora, Kathgodam, Ramnagar and Rudrapur), Uttar Pradesh (Lucknow, Bareilly, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Bijnore, Mathura and Bahedi), Rajasthan (Jaipur, Alwar and Bhilwara), Punjab (Hoshiarpur), Kerala (Kannur), West Bengal (Kolkata), Gujarat (Ahmedabad), Maharashtra (Nagpur), Delhi, and Haryana (Faridabad). The Finance Minister—Govt of Uttarakhand, Shri Prakash Pant, presided over the Valedictory function. Also present were Prof. Sandeep Shahare, National Coordinator, SKIFT (Skilling India in Film and Television) FTII; Course Directors Subhamoy Sengupta and Bela Negi; and FTII director Bhupendra Kaintola, who officially announced that the Institute plans to commence short-term film courses at Kumaun University.\n\n\n"}

His murder was widely publicised throughout South Korea. In the early 1990s it was claimed that Lee had never existed and that his death was the creation of South Korean propaganda.\n\nLee Seung-bok was the second of four children of Lee Seok-woo and Joo Dae-ha and was raised on their farm in a remote location on the north of Gyebang mountain.\n\nOn the night of 30 October 1968, 120 members of Unit 124 of the Korean People's Army landed at 8 separate locations between Ulchin – Samcheok in Gangwon province and moved inland on a 30-day mission to create guerilla bases in the Taebaek Mountains. On the morning of 31 October they entered several villages and began indoctrinating the villagers, several of whom slipped away to alert the authorities. Republic of Korea Army forces soon arrived in the area and began hunting down the infiltrators.\n\nOn the night of 9 December several North Korean commandos burst into the Lee household demanding food and shelter. The North Koreans asked Lee Seung-bok if he preferred North Korea or South Korea, when he replied South Korea the North Koreans began to beat him. Lee then said \"I hate Communists,\" this enraged the North Koreans who proceeded to kill Lee, his mother Joo Dae-ha (33), younger brother Lee Seung-su (7) and younger sister Lee Seung-Ja (4). Lee's father Lee Seok-woo and older brother Lee Hak-gwan managed to escape from the house and raised the alarm. The North Koreans proceeded to mutilate Lee Seung-bok's face by giving him a half Glasgow smile. The North Koreans fled the Lee house and were never identified, but they may have been among the 113 members of Unit 124 killed by South Korean forces.\n\nThe murders of Lee Seung-bok and his family were widely publicised in South Korea by the Park Chung-hee regime to mobilise anti-Communist/North Korean sentiment. Numerous statues of Lee were erected across South Korea including in the Children's Grand Park and War Memorial of Korea in Seoul and his story was taught in schools until the late 1980s.\n\nIn the early 1990s rumours began to circulate that Lee never existed and the story of his murder had been created by propaganda units of the South Korean military governments. In July 1999 prosecutors charged Kim Ju-eon the former general secretary of the People's Coalition for Media Reform with defamation after he included the December 11, 1968 \"The Chosun Ilbo\" report, entitled, \"I Don't Like the Communist Party. A Young Mouth of Resistance Torn,\" in an \"Exhibition of Misreporting\" and called the reports of the incident a lie. In September 2002, Kim was found guilty and was sentenced to 6-months in prison. In October 2004, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim to six months prison and two years probation for \"spreading false facts\" and concluded that the incident had taken place and that the media reports at the time were accurate.\n\nThe Lee Seung-bok Memorial Center was established in 1982 south of Lee's home in Nodong-ri, Gangwon, South Korea . The memorial center contains a memorial hall showing photos and paintings of Lee's life, death and burial. The Lee family house was moved to the park from Gyebang Mountain. An outdoor static park contains a Northrop F-5, a Cessna O-1, an M4 Sherman and various artillery pieces. The graves of Lee and his family are located within the park area.\n"}

After joining the territorial army in 1939 he was posted to a searchlight unit on Canvey Island.\n\nIn 1940 he transferred to the Royal Air force, trained as a pilot in Texas and was commissioned as an officer. He then served in No. 106 Squadron RAF and completed 18 bombing missions before being forced to crash land in France when returning from a raid on Stuttgart and four of his crew were killed. He was then imprisoned in Stalag Luft III where he became a member of an escape tunnelling team. There were three tunnels being dug named Tom, Dick and Harry and Broderick worked for two months in claustrophobic conditions on Dick, but Harry was completed first and after drawing lots he was 52 in the queue to go through that tunnel on the night of 24 March 1944.

{"id": "1374670", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1374670", "title": "Mainstream media", "text": "Mainstream media\n\nMainstream media (MSM) is a term and abbreviation used to refer collectively to the various large mass news media that influence a large number of people, and both reflect and shape prevailing currents of thought. The term is used to contrast with alternative media which may contain content with more dissenting thought at variance with the prevailing views of mainstream sources.\nThe term is often used for large news conglomerates, including newspapers and broadcast media, that underwent successive mergers in many countries. The concentration of media ownership has raised concerns of a homogenization of viewpoints presented to news consumers. Consequently, the term \"mainstream media\" has been widely used in conversation and the blogosphere, sometimes in oppositional, pejorative, or dismissive senses, in discussion of the mass media and media bias.\n\nAccording to philosopher Noam Chomsky, media organizations with an elite audience such as CBS News and \"The New York Times\" are successful corporations with the assets necessary to set the tone for other smaller news organizations which lack comparable resources by creating conversations that cascade down to smaller news organizations using the Associated Press and other means of aggregation. An elite mainstream sets the agenda and smaller organizations parrot it.\n\nThe advent of the Internet allowed the expression of a more diverse or alternative viewpoint which may contrast to mainstream media, to the point where the term mainstream media is seen in pejorative terms.\n\n\"Lamestream media\" is a common pejorative alternative. Sarah Palin referred to \"lamestream media,\" notably around 2009 during her participation in the Tea Party Express, in the context of what she perceived as media misrepresentation of the Tea Party movement.\n\nAnother term, originating on anonymous message boards, for the Mainstream Media is the acronym \"MSM\". The term is widely used by many on 4chan and Reddit, often as shorthand for the phrase \"Mainstream Media\".\n\nIn the United States, movie production is known to have been dominated by major studios since the early 20th Century; before that, there was a period in which Edison's Trust monopolized the industry. In the early twenty-first century the music and television industries was subject to media consolidation, with Sony Music Entertainment's parent company merging their music division with Bertelsmann AG's BMG to form Sony BMG and Tribune's The WB and CBS Corp.'s UPN merging to form The CW. In the case of Sony BMG there existed a \"Big Five\", later \"Big Four\", of major record companies, while The CW's creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the \"Big Four\" of American network (terrestrial) television (although the CW was actually partially owned by one of the Big Four in CBS). In television, the vast majority of broadcast and basic cable networks, over a hundred in all, are controlled by eight corporations: News Corporation (the Fox family of channels), The Walt Disney Company (which includes the ABC, ESPN and Disney brands), National Amusements (which includes CBS Corporation and Viacom), Comcast (which includes the NBC brands), Time Warner, Discovery Communications, E. W. Scripps Company, Cablevision, or some combination thereof.\n\nThere may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. Clear Channel Communications, especially since the Telecommunications Act of 1996, acquired many radio stations across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of spectrum by the FCC in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many markets local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.\n\nIn the United States, data on ownership and market share of media companies is not held in the public domain.\n\nOver time the rate of media mergers has increased, while the number of media outlets has also increased. This has resulted in a higher concentration of ownership, with fewer companies owning more media outlets. In 1983, 90% of US media was controlled by fifty companies; today, 90% is controlled by just six companies.\n\nAlthough Viacom and CBS Corporation have been separate companies since 2006, they are both partially owned subsidiaries of the private National Amusements company, headed by Sumner Redstone. As such, Paramount Home Entertainment handles DVD/Blu-ray distribution for most of the CBS Corporation library.\n\nA 2012 Gallup poll found that Americans' distrust in the mainstream media was higher than it had ever been, with 60% saying they had little or no trust in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. Distrust had increased since the previous few years, when Americans were already more negative about the media than they had been before 2004.\n\nThroughout 2016, Google and Facebook had been targeted to disperse a substantial amount of fake news, with the aim, it was claimed, of confusing Americans about various topics. Following the victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and during the campaign, Americans who supported Hillary Clinton were especially enraged about the noticeable amount of fake news about the election on the two websites. It was said that Facebook has been targeted in order to sway the American people with a particular agenda during the electoral cycle, although the chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg stated that \"Facebook did not have a role in the recent presidential campaign\". It was also reported that the insurmountable number of \"fake news\" posts about the election had increased the number of Americans distrusting the media.\n\nIn England, during 1922, after the closure of many radio stations, the British Broadcasting Company started its first daily radio transmission and started to grow an audience. Later that year John Reith, a Scottish engineer, would be appointed the first General Manager for the BBC. Later on January 1, 1927 the BBC was fully established by Royal Charter and renamed the British Broadcasting Corporation with Reith as the first Director-General. During November of 1936 the BBC began to expand into television broadcasting and was the first broadcaster to start the trend of a regularly scheduled TV service. \n\nToday the BBC is one of two chartered public broadcasting companies in the United Kingdom. The second is ITV, Independent Television, which was established in 1955 as the first public commercial television company after the Television act of 1954 in an effort to break up the monopoly of the monopoly the BBC had on television broadcasting, gaining fifteen regional broadcasting licenses in less than twenty years.<ref name=\"ABout ITV/History\"></ref> Today the BBC and ITV are the two free to air digital services offered to everyone in the United Kingdom and each others biggest competitors. The BBC has nine national television channels, BBC three, the first channel to switch from television to online, an interactive channel, ten national and forty local radio stations, BBC Online, and BBC Worldwide. ITV currently holds thirteen of the fifteen regional broadcasting licenses in the United Kingdom that carries their multiple channels including ITV, ITVhub, ITV2, ITVBe, ITV 3, ITV4, CITV, ITV Encore, \nBritbox, a video-on-demand service in collaboration with the BBC to bring British television content to the United States and Canada, and Cirkus, their own video-on-demand service. <ref name=\"About ITV/ What we do\"></ref>\n"}
{"id": "177860", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177860", "title": "Man of La Mancha", "text": "Man of La Mancha\n\nMan of La Mancha is a 1965 musical with a book by Dale Wasserman, lyrics by Joe Darion, and music by Mitch Leigh. It is adapted from Wasserman's non-musical 1959 teleplay \"I, Don Quixote\", which was in turn inspired by Miguel de Cervantes and his 17th-century novel \"Don Quixote\". It tells the story of the \"mad\" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition. The work is not and does not pretend to be a faithful rendition of either Cervantes' life or \"Don Quixote\"; for example, the historical Cervantes had no contact with the Spanish Inquisition, and Don Quixote's horse Rocinante is never stolen. Wasserman complained repeatedly about people taking the work as a musical version of \"Don Quixote\".\n\nThe original 1965 Broadway production ran for 2,328 performances and won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical. The musical has been revived four times on Broadway, becoming one of the most enduring works of musical theatre.\n\nThe principal song, \"The Impossible Dream\", became a standard. The musical has played in many other countries around the world, with productions in Dutch, French (translation by Jacques Brel), German, Hebrew, Irish, Japanese, Korean, Icelandic, Bengali, Gujarati, Uzbek, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili, Finnish, Ukrainian and nine distinctly different dialects of the Spanish language.\n\n\"Man of La Mancha\" was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut in 1965 and had its New York premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in 1965.\n\n\"Man of La Mancha\" started as a non-musical teleplay written by Dale Wasserman for CBS's \"DuPont Show of the Month\" program. This original telecast starred Lee J. Cobb, Colleen Dewhurst (who replaced Viveca Lindfors), and Eli Wallach and was not performed on a thrust stage but on a television sound stage. The DuPont Corporation disliked the title \"Man of La Mancha\", thinking that its viewing audience would not know what La Mancha actually meant, so a new title, \"I, Don Quixote\", was chosen. The play was broadcast live on November 9, 1959, with an estimated audience of 20 million. The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, Billy Rose Collection, has a rare tape of this broadcast. Wasserman has left us \"A Diary of \"I, Don Quixote\"\" telling the teleplay's history; he himself was unaware that there was any surviving recording.\n\nYears after this television broadcast and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non-musical Broadway play, director Albert Marre called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical. Mitch Leigh was selected as composer, with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall. Unusually for the time, this show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass, instead making heavier use of brass, woodwinds, percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort.\n\nThe original lyricist of the musical was poet W. H. Auden, but his lyrics were discarded, some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting, attacking the bourgeois audience at times. Auden's lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion.\n\nThe musical first played at the Goodspeed Opera House in Connecticut in 1965. Rex Harrison was to be the original star of this production, but although Harrison had starred in a musical role in the stage and film versions of \"My Fair Lady\", the musical demands of the role of Don Quixote were too heavy for him. \n\nAfter 21 previews, the musical opened Off-Broadway at the experimental thrust-stage ANTA Washington Square Theatre in Greenwich Village on November 22, 1965. The show moved to Broadway to the Martin Beck Theatre on March 20, 1968, then to the Eden Theatre on March 3, 1971, and finally to the Mark Hellinger Theatre on May 26, 1971 for its last month, a total original Broadway run of 2,328 performances. Musical staging and direction were by Albert Marre, choreography was by Jack Cole, and Howard Bay was the scenic and lighting designer, with costumes by Bay and Patton Campbell.\n\nRichard Kiley won a Tony Award for his performance as Cervantes/Quixote in the original production, and it made Kiley a bona fide Broadway star. Kiley was replaced in the original Broadway run by first Jose Ferrer on Broadway and in the 1966 National Tour, and then by operatic baritone David Atkinson. Atkinson also performed Cervantes/Quixote in the 1968 National Tour and for all of the matinee performances in the 1972 Broadway revival, which also starred Kiley.\n\nThe original cast also included Irving Jacobson (Sancho), Ray Middleton (Innkeeper), Robert Rounseville (The Padre), and Joan Diener (Aldonza). John Cullum, Hal Holbrook, and Lloyd Bridges also played Cervantes and Don Quixote during the run of the production. Keith Andes also played the role.\n\nThe musical was performed on a single set that suggested a dungeon. All changes in location were created by alterations in the lighting, by the use of props supposedly lying around the floor of the dungeon, and by reliance on the audience's imagination. More recent productions, however, have added more scenery.\n\nThe original West End London production was at the Piccadilly Theatre, opening on April 24, 1968 and running for 253 performances. Keith Michell starred, with Joan Diener reprising her original role and Bernard Spear as Sancho.\n\nThe play has been revived on Broadway four times:\n\nIn the film \"Man of La Mancha\" (1972), the title role went to Peter O'Toole (singing voice dubbed by Simon Gilbert), James Coco was Sancho, and Sophia Loren was Aldonza.\n\nHal Linden played Quixote in the show's 1988 U.S. National tour, and Robert Goulet played Quixote in the 1997–98 U.S. National tour.\n\nA studio-made recording of the score was released in 1996, conducted by Paul Gemignani and starring Plácido Domingo as Quixote, Mandy Patinkin as Sancho, Julia Migenes as Aldonza, Jerry Hadley as the Priest and Samuel Ramey as the Innkeeper.\n\nIn 2014, \"Man of La Mancha\" featured as part of the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe Shakespeare Theatre Company produced \"Man of La Mancha\" as part of their 2014-2015 season. The production starred Anthony Warlow as Quixote and Amber Iman as Aldonza/Dulcinea.\n\nIn the late sixteenth century, failed author-soldier-actor and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes has been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition, along with his manservant. They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as \"the Governor\" suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as \"the Duke,\" charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The \"Governor\" agrees.\n\nCervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a knight-errant. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his \"squire\", Sancho Panza. (\"Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)\")\n\nDon Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote's mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quijote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.\n\nCervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn's serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically (\"It's All The Same\"), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.\n\nDon Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty (\"Dulcinea\"). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote's kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote's tender ballad into a mocking serenade.\n\nMeanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote's niece, has gone with Quixote's housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote's madness may bring them, than with his actual welfare (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him\").\n\nCervantes chooses \"the Duke\" to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fiancé, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]\").\n\nBack at the inn, Sancho delivers a missive from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than \"I Really Like Him\". Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote's behavior and her inability to laugh at him (\"What Do You Want of Me?\") In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song (\"Little Bird, Little Bird\"). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.\n\nThe priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun's heat (\"The Barber's Song\"). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the \"Golden Helmet of Mambrino\", which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote's view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile (\"To Each His Dulcinea\").\n\nQuixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn's courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on (\"The Impossible Dream\"). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight (\"The Combat\"). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination – and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho – he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so (\"Knight of the Woeful Countenance\").\n\nQuixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one's enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off (\"The Abduction\"). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood (\"The Impossible Dream\" – first reprise).\n\nAt this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried. The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.\n\nThe Don Quixote play resumes (\"Man of La Mancha\" – first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies (\"Moorish Dance\") who take advantage of Quixote's naiveté and steal everything they own, including Quixote's horse Rocinante and Sancho's donkey Dapple. Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea (\"Aldonza\").\n\nSuddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote's mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the \"Knight of the Mirrors\". He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote (\"Knight of the Mirrors\"), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet – he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.\n\nCervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.\n\nQuixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up (\"A Little Gossip\"), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of \"Dulcinea\" and tries to help him remember the words of \"The Impossible Dream.\" Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again (\"Man of La Mancha\" – second reprise). But it is too late – in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings \"The Psalm\" (Psalm 130 in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend's death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, \"My name is Dulcinea.\"\n\nThe Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, \"Don Quixote\". As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing \"The Impossible Dream\" in chorus.\n\n\n\n\nA Hebrew-language production was produced by Giora Godik in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1967.\n\nA Japanese-language production entitled \"The Impossible Dream\" was produced in Tokyo, Japan, where Matsumoto Kōshirō IX (as Ichikawa Somegorō VI) took the lead role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe musical has been and continues to be produced in many other languages around the world, and in 2012 and 2013 played in Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic, Romania, China, Poland, Dominican Republic, Chile, Russia, and in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Cast albums are available in many languages including German from the 1968 Vienna performance (\"Der Mann von La Mancha\") and the 1969 Hamburg cast (\"Der Mann von La Mancha\"), the 1969 Dutch cast (\"De Man van La Mancha\"), the 1970 Norwegian cast (\"Mannen frå La Mancha\"), the 1997 Polish cast (\"Człowiek Z La Manchy\"), the 1997 Czech cast (\"Muž Z la Manchy\"), the 2001 Hungarian cast (\"La Mancha Lovagja\"), and many others.\n\n\n"}

Kennedy. She married Oswald during his temporary defection to the Soviet Union and emigrated to the United States with him. She was not implicated in the assassination and remarried two years after Oswald's murder.\n\nPorter was born Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova in city of Molotovsk (now Severodvinsk), in Arkhangelsk Oblast of Russian SFSR. She lived there with her mother and stepfather until 1957, when she moved to Minsk to live with her uncle Ilya Prusakov, a colonel in the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs, and to study pharmacy.\n\nMarina met Lee Harvey Oswald (a former U.S. Marine who had defected to the Soviet Union) at a dance on March 17, 1961. They married six weeks later and had a daughter, June Lee, born the following year. In June 1962, the family emigrated to the United States and settled in Dallas, Texas. At a party in February 1963, George de Mohrenschildt introduced the couple to Ruth Paine, a Quaker and Russian language student.\n\nIn January 1963, Oswald ordered a Smith & Wesson .38 revolver and then, in March, a Mannlicher–Carcano rifle. Later that month, as Marina told the Warren Commission, she took photographs of Oswald dressed in black and holding his weapons along with an issue of \"The Militant\" newspaper, which named ex-general Edwin Walker as a \"fascist.\" These photos became known as the \"backyard photos\" of Lee Oswald, which some conspiracy theorists dismissed as fake. The series of photographs were later found in the garage of the Paine household, with the exception of one, which had been given to George de Mohrenschildt. The photograph given to de Mohrenschildt was signed by Lee Oswald, and has a quote attributed to Marina in Russian, the translation of which reads \"Hunter of Fascists, Ha-Ha-Ha!!!\"\n\nIn April 1963, Marina and her daughter moved in with Ruth Paine (who had recently separated from her husband, Michael). Lee Oswald rented a separate room in Dallas and briefly moved to New Orleans during the summer of 1963. He returned to Dallas in early October, eventually renting a room in a boarding house in the Oak Cliff district of Dallas. Paine learned from a neighbor that employment was available at the Texas School Book Depository, and Oswald was hired and began working there on October 16, 1963, as an order filler. On October 20, Marina gave birth to a second daughter, Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald. Her husband continued to live in Oak Cliff on weekdays, but stayed with her at the Paine household in Irving on weekends, an arrangement that continued until Oswald assassinated Kennedy.\n\nMarina learned of the assassination of President Kennedy from the media coverage of the event, and later, of the arrest of her husband. That afternoon, Dallas Police Department detectives arrived at the Paine household, and when asked if Lee owned a rifle, she gestured to the garage, where Oswald stored his rifle rolled up in a blanket; no rifle was found. She was subsequently questioned both at the Paine household and later at Dallas Police Department headquarters, in reference to her husband's involvement in the assassination of the President and the shooting of Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit.\n\nShe was widowed two days after the assassination when her husband was mortally wounded by Jack Ruby as Oswald was being transferred from the City Jail to the County Jail. She was widowed at only 22; Jack Ruby died when she was 25.\n\nAfter the assassination of Kennedy and the arrest of her husband, Marina was under Secret Service protection until she completed her testimony before the Warren Commission. She made a total of four appearances before the commission. Questions about her reliability as a witness were expressed within the commission, particularly in regard to her claims about an assassination attempt on General Edwin Walker, and her allegation that Lee Oswald had intended to assassinate Richard Nixon. In her testimony, she stated her belief that her husband was guilty, an opinion she reiterated in testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978.\n\nShe remained at first in Dallas, Texas. Per William Manchester in \"The Death of a President\":\n\nTwo years after Oswald's death, she married Kenneth Jess Porter, with whom she had a son. Porter was a twice-divorced drag racer who was in jail 11 weeks after the marriage. Marina accused him of domestic violence, but a justice of the peace \"reunited them.\" In the mid-1970s, she moved to Rockwall, Texas. In 1989, she became a naturalized United States citizen. She has appeared in numerous documentaries on the Kennedy assassination. She now contends that Lee Oswald was innocent of the assassination.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25397639", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25397639", "title": "Ndocciata", "text": "Ndocciata\n\nNdocciata is an ancient Christmas festival celebrated in Molise, southern Italy, specifically in the city of Agnone. On the evening of December 24 the “Ndocciata” of Agnone is a parade of a great number of “‘ndocce” (torches), structures with a typical fanwise shape, made of silver fir pinewood pallets. They may be only one torch or, more often, with multiple torches up to twenty fires. Four metres high, “‘ndocce” are transported by different carriers dressed in traditional costumes. The big bell of St. Anthony’s Church is rung, and groups from the cities’ districts (Capammonde and Capabballe, Colle Sente, Guastra, Onofrio, San Quirico) consisting of hundreds of carriers of all ages, light their ndocce (torches) to set off along the main streets which thus becomes what locals call a “river of fire.” There is a choral participation and bagpipers along the roads of the village, and groups compete in order to have the biggest and the most beautiful “‘ndocce”. The procession ends with a bonfire called “Bonfire of Brotherhood” at Plebiscite Square where a Nativity scene is displayed.\n\nThe roots of the festival precede the Christian and Roman eras to the time of the Samnite tribes. The Samnites were using ndocce as a source of light during the strategic tribal shifts that occurred at night. The tradition has since been passed down to farmers (noted after the 9th century) that sought to illuminate the path from the various districts that took them to reach the many churches in town on Christmas night and witness the Nativity. Different traditions have been reflected in Ndocciata over the years, for example, if the wind blew from the north during the bonfire it was expected to be a good year. During medieval times, a roaring fire from the torches helped overcome witches. Another Ndocciata tradition recalls that boys on this occasion tried to make a good impression in the eyes of the town girls they were competing for, and they tried to create the most beautiful and compact (in order to make it last longer) ndocce. At the end of the parade the ndoccia was brought under the window of the girl on which he pinned his hope. If she looked out meant that she appreciated the gesture, adversely a bucket of water extinguished the torch and the ardour of youth. The public square bonfire lighting is now meant for people meet to say goodbye to anything negative, and is symbolically burned in the fire. At the end of the parade, a Nativity is displayed symbolizing not only Christmas but renewal for a new year.\n\nThe ndocce are large torches made of silver fir pine and white bundles of dried broom held together by twine. The torches are three to four metres high and sometimes are joined by horizontal poles to form groups that can reach up to twenty torches arranged in the shape of a fan. The carriers wear black complemented with a hood or hat, which is derived from the ancient garments of the Oscan Samnite tribe as a tacit form of humility.\n"}
{"id": "313538", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=313538", "title": "Nepotism", "text": "Nepotism\n\nNepotism is based on favour granted to relatives in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by Catholic popes and bishops. Trading parliamentary employment for favors is a modern-day example of nepotism. Criticism of nepotism, however, can be found in ancient Indian texts such as the Kural literature.\n\nThe term comes from the Italian word \"nepotismo\", which is based on the Latin word \"nepos\" meaning 'nephew'. Since the Middle Ages and until the late 17th century, some Catholic popes and bishops, who had taken vows of chastity, and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.\n\nSeveral popes elevated nephews and other relatives to the cardinalate. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal \"dynasty\". For instance, Pope Callixtus III, head of the Borgia family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming Pope Alexander VI. Alexander then elevated Alessandro Farnese, his mistress's brother, to cardinal; Farnese would later go on to become Pope Paul III.\n\nPaul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when Pope Innocent XII issued the bull \"Romanum decet Pontificem\", in 1692. The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.\n\nAccording to the ancient Indian philosopher Valluvar, nepotism is both evil and unwise.\n\nNepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The British English expression \"Bob's your uncle\" is thought to have originated when Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, promoted his nephew, Arthur Balfour, to the esteemed post of Chief Secretary for Ireland, which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.\n\nNepotism can also occur within organizations when a person is employed due to familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.\n\nNepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people. Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees, and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from \"Forbes\" magazine stated \"there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name.\" Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.\n\nOutside of national politics, accusations of nepotism are made in instances of \"prima facie\" favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:\n\nNepotism refers to partiality to family whereas cronyism refers to partiality to a partner or friend. Favoritism, the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance.\n"}

The event attracts people of different ages and most visitors come from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, UK or Germany\n\nThere are 3 main stages on the festival, the first of which is \"Mimer\" with a staggering reverb of more than 7 seconds; concrete and steel structures are the raw surroundings. \"KraftWerk\" is the old power plant, where the clubbing and dancing atmosphere is intense. Camp-303 is the official underground stage. On top of that, the \"ReallyOpenStage\" gives visitors a chance to play either on bought or borrowed machines. Art installations are present in Mimer and around the festival area.\n\nNorbergfestival is held inside and around an abandoned mining area. The main concert building, \"Mimerlaven\", was once a pithead frame for the extraction of iron ore. The structure was erected in 1957. Hematite and magnetite from the pits around Norberg were brought into Mimer, crushed and then further processed. The mining business was discontinued in the 1980s.\n\nEvery year, around 90 artists perform at Norbergfestival. Music styles include Avantgarde, EAM, Drone, Electronica, 8-bit, Acid, Breakcore, Detroit Techno and Dubstep. Notable artists like Pole, Pamelia Kurstin, Luke Vibert, Kid606, Fennesz, B12, Vladislav Delay, Milanese, Pan Sonic, Monolake, Bong-Ra, Skream, Biosphere, DJ Food, Psilodump, Andreas Tilliander, Paul Woolford, Skudge and many more have performed at the festival.\n\nOriginally, the festival was run by the Danish-Swedish Norbergfestival association. Since 2012 the festival is being run by the Swedish Norbergfestival association. In 2015 the organisation changed its name to \"Anrikningsverket\".\n\n\n"}

A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a miracle or falsely attributing a sacred text to a biblical figure due to the belief that the \"end justifies the means\", in this case the end of increasing faith by whatever means available.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" reports the phrase was first used in English in 1678.

{"id": "1740832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1740832", "title": "Public nuisance", "text": "Public nuisance\n\nIn English criminal law, public nuisance is a class of common law offence in which the injury, loss, or damage is suffered by the public, in general, rather than an individual, in particular.\n\nIn \"Kent v Johnson\" the Supreme Court of the ACT held that Public nuisance is \"an unlawful act or omission ... which endangers the lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the public or by which the public are obstructed in the exercise or enjoyment of any right common to all\". And also, Public Nuisance is a criminal offense at some common law and by statute under some states. To establish a prima facie case of public nuisance, a private individual will have to prove: (1) title to sue, (2) that the interference is with a public right and (3) that the defendant's interference is substantial and unreasonable.\n\nIn the case \"Walsh v Ervin\", as the general principle is usually stated, an individual cannot sue alone for relief in respect of a nuisance to a public highway unless he has sustained some particular damage, in the sense of some substantial injury, direct and not merely consequential, beyond that suffered by the public generally.\nIn the case \"Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd\", a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large\nThe interference must be substantial and unreasonable in order to establish public nuisance. In modern world, daily inconveniences and annoyances are part of unreasonable and substantial interference. \nHowever, there are some examples that shows even if it could cause interference to the public, there is no public nuisance. For example, in \"Maitland v Raisbeck\", \"it would seem that every driver of a vehicle on the road would be turned into an insurer in respect of latent defects in this machines\", even if a danger was created because of moral use of vehicle. In the case \"Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd\", Roper Chief Judge in Equity stated that:\n\nit appears that in cases of this kind if the defendant has available to him reasonable means of removing or avoiding the obstruction, he is responsible for the nuisance if he does not adopt those means. The test is not whether an obstruction has been caused, but whether the obstruction could reasonably have been avoided. I think, however, that this is not the sole test of whether a person is responsible for the nuisance caused by the assembly of a crowd of people, and that a more absolute liability rests upon the person whose business involves the gathering together of a crowd, or who, apart from any consideration of the bona fide conduct of his business, deliberately continues to gather the crowd. (citations omitted).\n\nThe nuisance action began in twelfth century England as a criminal writ, belonging only to the Crown. It was used in cases that involved encroachments upon the King’s land or the blocking of public roads or waterways. The King sought to punish these criminal infringements, commonly known as “purprestures,” through criminal proceedings. Over time, activities prosecuted as public nuisances included everything from embezzling public funds to having a tiger pen next to a highway, from assisting a homicidal maniac to escape to placing a mutilated corpse on a doorstep, and from selling rotten meat to “subdividing houses to the point where they become ‘overpestered’ with the poor.” As these examples demonstrate, early authority to commence public nuisance actions was derived from the sovereign’s “police power.\"\n\nSpencer (1989 at 59) describes the offence as, \"...a rag-bag of odds and ends which we should nowadays call 'public welfare offences'\". But the common feature of the crime is that members of the public suffer a common injury through interference with rights which they enjoy as citizens. The modern definition is found in paras 31-40 Archbold (2005):\n\nIn \"Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd\" the issue was whether quarrying activities—which showered the neighbourhood with stones and splinters, and caused dust and vibrations—were a private nuisance affecting some of the residents (which would have been civil), but not a public nuisance affecting all Her Majesty's liege subjects living in the area. In his judgment Romer LJ concluded at p 184:\n\nDenning LJ. agreed at p 191\n\nIn \"R v Madden\" (1975) 1 WLR 1379 the defendant telephoned a bomb hoax to a steel works whose business was disrupted for about an hour. James LJ. accepted that hoax telephone calls falsely asserting the presence of explosives could amount to an offence of public nuisance but the few employees whose day was disrupted were not a sufficiently wide class of the public. But in \"R v Norbury\" (1978) Crim. LR 435 the defendant made 605 obscene telephone calls to 494 different women over a period of four years. This repetitive behaviour over a long period, intended to cause offence and alarm, was held the kind of behaviour which the public has an interest in condemning. This is not without its problems because each telephone call lacks the element of common injury. As a comparison, the cases of \"R v Ruffell\" (1991) 13 Cr. App. R. (S) 204 and \"R v Shorrock\" (1994) QB 279 involved the prosecution of the organisers of \"acid house\" parties at night in fields adjacent to residential accommodation with liability confirmed because they knew, or ought to have known, that there was a real risk of creating the sort of nuisance that in fact occurred. At each party there was major traffic disruption and the noise of music, with clean-up operations required the following day. While \"R v Ong\" (2001) 1 Cr. App. R. (S) 404 involved a betting scam in which the floodlights at a Premier Division football match between Charlton Athletic and Liverpool were to be sabotaged which was inherently dangerous to the thousands within the ground.\n\nIn \"R v Soul\" (1980) 70 Cr. App. R. 295 a group who agreed to secure the unlawful release of a restricted Broadmoor patient was convicted of conspiracy to effect a public nuisance. The court seems to have assumed that the public would have been exposed to danger had the plan been put into effect. That the Crown had failed to prove any actual danger or common injury was not considered (see the critical commentary at (1980) Crim. LR 234 suggesting that the courts were improperly reintroducing \"public mischief\" into the law despite the ruling by the House of Lords in \"R v Withers\" (1975) AC 842). Similarly, in \"R v Millward\" (1986) 8 Cr. App R(S) 209 the defendant made hundreds of telephone calls (636 in a single day) to a young woman police officer with whom he had become infatuated, at the police station where she worked. As to the requirement of common injury, Glidewell LJ, said:\n\nIn \"R v Johnson (Anthony)\" (1997) 1 WLR 367, the Court of Appeal confronted the problem head-on. The defendant had made hundreds of obscene telephone calls to at least thirteen women. The defence argued each telephone call was a single isolated act to an individual. Tucker J, rejected the argument at pp370–371:\n\nThis was followed in a number of cases such as \"R v Holliday and Leboutillier\" (2004) EWCA Crim 1847 in which two animal liberation activists made a large number of telephone calls to employees and shareholders of certain companies whose activities the appellants opposed. The calls were designed to jam the company telephone switchboards, and some of them were threatening and intimidating.\n\nIn \"R v Goldstein and Rimmington\" (2005) UKHL 63 two separate appeal cases were considered together. The Lords began their judgment with a detailed review of the law and its history. Two arguments were raised by the defence. The first was that most of the factual situations that might otherwise have been criminal public nuisances, had now been covered by statutes. Thus, for example, s1 Protection from Harassment Act 1997 would now be used in cases involving multiple telephone calls, and s63 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 confers powers on the police to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave \"at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality\". These statutes had, in effect, made the common law offence redundant and it should no longer be considered an offence in English law. The Lords agreed that, as a matter of practice, all alleged offences falling within the remit of statutes would now be charged under those statutes. It also accepted that this left only a very small scope for the application of the common law offence. But, just as the courts had no power to create new offences (\"R v Withers\"), and could not widen existing offences so as to retrospectively criminalise conduct (\"R v Misra and Srivastava\" (2004) EWCA Crim 2375), it equally had no power to abolish existing offences. However, cases such as \"R v Norbury\" and \"R v Johnson (Anthony)\" would now be charged under the relevant statutes.\n\nThe second argument raised by the defence was that the law lacked the certainty to be valid under Article 7 European Convention on Human Rights.\nOf all the common law offences considered at Strasbourg, only the criterion of \"contra bonos mores\" had been held to lack the appropriate quality of certainty (see \"Hashman and Harrup v United Kingdom\" (1999) 30 EHRR 241). The Lords therefore held that, as defined in Archbold, the offence did have sufficient certainty so that any legal practitioner asked to advise on whether proposed conduct was likely to be criminal, would be able to give an accurate answer.\n\nAs a cultural reference, Goldstein sent an envelope to a friend of his containing a small quantity of salt. Some of this salt escaped from the envelope at a postal sorting office, which was closed as a precaution so that tests could be carried out to determine whether the material spilt was dangerous. The Lords accepted that a significant number of people were disadvantaged by the closure of the sorting office and the loss of delivery on that day, but held that the appellant did not have the appropriate \"mens rea\" because he did not know or reasonably should have known (because the means of knowledge were available to him) that the salt would escape in the sorting office or in the course of postal delivery.\n\nIn the Marx Brothers film \"Duck Soup\", Groucho Marx plays the president of the mythical land of Freedonia. One day while in his office, he hears a noisy peanut vendor (Chico Marx) out in the street. \"Do you want to be a public nuisance?\" Groucho asks. \"Sure,\" Chico replies, \"how much does the job pay?\"\n\n"}
{"id": "26309", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26309", "title": "Regency dance", "text": "Regency dance\n\nRegency dance is the term for historical dances of the period ranging roughly from 1790 to 1825. Some feel that the popular use of the term \"Regency dance\" is not technically correct, as the actual English Regency (the future George IV ruling on behalf of mad King George III) lasted only from 1811 until 1820. However, the term \"Regency\" has been used to refer to a much broader period than the historical Regency for a very long time, particularly in areas such as the history of art and architecture, literature, and clothing. This is because there are consistencies of style over this period which make having a single term useful.\n\nMost popular exposure to this era of dance comes in the works of Jane Austen. Balls occur in her novels and are discussed in her letters, but specifics are few. Films based on her works tend to incorporate modern revival English Country Dance; however, they rarely incorporate dances actually of the period and do them without the appropriate footwork and social style which make them accurate to the period. Dances of this era were lively and bouncy, not the smooth and stately style seen in films. Steps ranging from simple skipping to elaborate ballet-style movements were used.\n\nIn the early part of this period, up to the early 1810s, the ballroom was dominated by the country dance, the cotillion, and the scotch reel. \n\nIn the longways Country Dance, a line of couples perform figures with each other, progressing up and down the line. Regency country dances were often proceeded by a brief March by the couples, then begun by the top lady in the set and her partner, who would dance down the set to the bottom. Each couple in turn as they reached the top would likewise dance down until the entire set had returned to its original positions. This could be a lengthy process, easily taking an hour in a long set. An important social element was the calling of the dance by the leading lady (a position of honor), who would determine the figures, steps, and music to be danced. The rest of the set would listen to the calling dancing master or pick up the dance by observing the leading couple. Austen mentions in her letters instances in which she and her partner called the dance.\n\nThe cotillion was a French import, performed in a square using more elaborate footwork. It consisted of a \"chorus\" figure unique to each dance which was danced alternately with a standard series of up to ten \"changes\", which were simple figures such as a right hand moulinet (star) common to cotillions in general.\n\nThe scotch reel of the era consisted of alternate heying (interlacing) and setting (fancy steps danced in place) by a line of three or four dancers. More complex reels appear in manuals as well but it's unclear if they ever actually caught on. A sixsome reel is mentioned in a description of Scottish customs in the early 1820s and eightsome reels (danced in squares like cotillions) occur in some dance manuscripts of the era.\n\nIn the 1810s, the era of the Regency proper, English dance began an important transition with the introduction of the quadrille and the waltz.\n\nThe Waltz was first imported to England around 1810, but it was not considered socially acceptable until continental visitors at the post-Napoleonic-Wars celebrations danced it in London—and even then it remained the subject of anti-waltz diatribes, caricatures, and jokes. Even the decadent Lord Byron was scandalized by the prospect of people \"embracing\" on the dance floor. The Regency version is relatively slow, and done up on the balls of the feet with the arms in a variety of graceful positions. The Sauteuse is a leaping waltz commonly done in 2/4 rather than 3/4 time, similar in pattern (leap-glide-close) to the Redowa and Waltz Galop of the later nineteenth century.\n\nFirst imported from France by Lady Jersey in 1815, the Quadrille was a shorter version of the earlier cotillions. Figures from individual cotillions were assembled into sets of five or six figures, and the changes were left out, producing much shorter dances. By the late 1810s, it was not uncommon to dance a series of quadrilles during the evening, generally consisting of the same first three figures combined with a variety of different fourth and fifth figures. Jane Austen's niece Fanny danced quadrilles and in their correspondence Jane mentions that she finds them much inferior to the cotillions of her own youth.\n\nBy the late 1810s, under siege from the Quadrille, dancing masters began to invent \"new\" forms of country dance, often with figures borrowed from the Quadrille, and giving them exotic names such as the Danse Ecossoise and Danse Espagnuole which suggested entire new dances but actually covered very minor variations in the classic form. A few of these dances became sufficiently popular that they survived through the entire 19th century. One example of this is the \"Spanish dance\" popular in vintage dance circles, which is a solitary survivor of its entire genre of Regency-era dances.\n\n\"La Boulangere\", the only dance mentioned by name in Jane Austen's writings, is a simple circle dance for a group of couples. Sir Roger de Coverly, mentioned by Charles Dickens, is the ancestor of America's Virginia Reel.\n\nNumerous instruction manuals survive from the Regency era. Several by Thomas Wilson are in the US Library of Congress online collection. The Scotch Reel is described by Francis Peacock, whose manual is also available in the LC collection.\n\nThe first major revival of English Country Dance, one of the major types of Regency dance, was by Englishman Cecil Sharp in the early 20th century. Various other revivals have followed, most using at least some of Sharp's research. Today, there are many groups around the world which perform a variety of English period dances, including many of the types of dance which were popular during the English Regency.\n\nRegency dance has gained popularity at science fiction conventions, in part due to the efforts of John Hertz. Reconstructed dances from the era are taught to newcomers and experienced dancers alike. Some authors—notably, Larry Niven—have added their personal enthusiasm to the trend. Needless to say, Regency dance provides new opportunities for SF fen—typically avid costumers—to develop and wear new regalia.\n\nIn Silicon Valley, the Bay Area English Regency Society sponsors local dance classes and formal balls in churches, community centers, and other venues.\nSome enthusiasts go to extremes: Cisco Systems founders Sandra Lerner and Len Bosack created a foundation that bought a Regency-era country house once owned by Jane Austen's brother. In Australia, Earthly Delights Historic Dance Academy and John Gardiner-Garden run a Regency Dance School in conjunction with Jane Austen Festival Australia every April.\n\n"}

It is observed for ten days from the 25th day of the Angami calendar month of \"Kezei\" (usually corresponding to 25 February in the Gregorian calendar) under the auspices of the Angami Public Organisation in association with many other organizations and the state government. It is a \"purification festival\" held to wash off all past sins. The objective of the festival is to renew and \"make holy\" by cleansing the \"body and the soul\" of the village as a whole, and to bring forth unity among all communities of Nagaland. It also marks initiation of young people to adulthood and is considered an \"identity marker of the Angami\". The Christian converts among the tribals have gradually rejected these rituals.\n\nSekrenyi is a compound word formed by 'sekre' meaning \"sanctification\" and 'thenyi' meaning \"festival.\" The festival calendar is linked to the agricultural cycle, which varies from village to village. Thus, the celebration is held between the months of December–March, and the duration also varies from ten to fifteen days.\n\nThe festival is generally held starting from 25 February as per the Gregorian calendar. It is celebrated by both the Kruna Angami and Christian Angami. The duration is reduced to five days for the Christian villagers who had earlier converted to Christianity but belonged to the same tribe; they participate in the festivities but they do not follow any of the rituals connected with it.\n\nA number of rituals and ceremonies are involved with the festival. On the first day, which is known as \"Kezie\", people sprinkle themselves with a few drops of rice water drawn from a pot named \"Zumho\". The water drops are first gathered into leaves, and the chief lady of the house reverently fixes the leaves at the three main corner pillars of the house. This is followed by the men assembling at the well to bathe.\n\nOn the second day, young men of the village assemble in the village to perform ablutions. They adorn themselves with two new shawls, and then ritualistically sprinkle the holy water on their chests, knees and right arms as a mark of washing away all their sins and ill luck. When they come back from the well, a sacrificial offer of a cock is performed.\n\nThe fourth day of the festival marks the New Year of the Angamis. It begins with revelry by singing and feasting which lasts for three days. The young people, both men and unmarried girls with shaven heads gather and sing traditional songs the entire day; the songs relate to past days of valour and bravery. For the revelry \nof music and dance, the men and women of the community wear traditional dress; while men carry head hunting spades, women carry baskets.\n\nThe seventh day is devoted to hunting by the young men of the tribe. On the eighth day, the ritual involves pulling down of a gate (meaning replacing an old gate that demarcates the property). This is followed in the next two days by the people of villages formally exchanging visits and offering greetings. During the period of the ten day festivities, field operations are suspended; in local terminology this act is called \"Penyû\". Following the completion of the festival period, when men of the villages have cleansed themselves and sought blessings, cultivation, house building and marriages may restart for the year.\n"}

The main event of the show was billed as \"the Million Dollar Challenge\" as the storyline was that the winner of the match would not only win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but also win a $1,000,000 purse, part of the illusion that professional wrestling was a legitimate sporting competition. The main event saw champion \"The Nature Boy\" Ric Flair defend the championship against long time rival \"The American Dream\" Dusty Rhodes, with boxer Joe Frazier acting as the special guest referee for the match. The show also saw the championship matches for the NWA United States Championship, NWA World Television Championship, NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship, NWA Brass Knuckles Championship and NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn 2014, the WWE Network included the previous Starrcades (1983–1986), which had been transmitted via closed-circuit television, alongside the rest of the Starrcades in the pay-per-view section.\n\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, it was tradition for the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) member Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) to hold major professional wrestling events at Thanksgiving and Christmas, often at the Greensboro Coliseum in Greensboro, North Carolina in the center of JCP's Virginia, North and South Carolina territory. In 1983, JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition, bringing in wrestlers from other NWA affiliates and broadcasting the show its territory on closed-circuit television. Starrcade soon became the flagship event of the year for JCP (later World Championship Wrestling, WCW), their Super Bowl event featuring their most important storyline feuds and championship matches. The 1984 event was the second show to use the Starrcade name.\n\nThe Starrcade show featured a number of professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n"}

Privately constructed, it was inaugurated as the Teatro Nuovo to replace the smaller 800-seat \"Cesareo Regio Teatro di San Pietro\" on 21 April 1801 with a performance of Johann Simon Mayr's \"Ginevra di Scozia\". Initially, the Nuovo had 1,400 seats. In 1821, it became known as the Teatro Grande.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and finally closed its doors in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. Gian Antonio Selva, the architect of the La Fenice in Venice, was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium. However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of Milan's La Scala opera house. The \"Nuovo\" became a mixture of La Fenice on the inside and La Scala on the exterior.\n\nSeveral name changes have occurred during the theatre's lifetime, the first in 1821 when it became the \"Teatro Grande\" and it was under this name that the theatre was the site of two Verdi opera premieres: \"Il corsaro\" in 1848 (featuring the soprano Giuseppina Strepponi, who Verdi married in 1859, in the leading role) and \"Stiffelio\", a production which Verdi supervised - not without controversy - in 1850. However, before these premieres, Verdi's operas had begun to dominate the Teatro Grande's stage, followed, as the century progressed, by all the major works of the opera repertoire, including those by Puccini and Wagner.\n\nA further name change followed in 1861 due to a change from private to public ownership. Thus it became the \"Teatro Comunale\" and existed as such throughout the latter years of the 19th century. By 1881, seating capacity had been increased to 2,000 through the use of existing standing room spaces; but, by that December, the theatre was declared to be unsafe and it was closed for renovations, during which electricity replaced gas lighting for the reopening in 1889 with 1,000 seats.\n\nWithin hours of his death in January 1901, the theatre was once again renamed, this time to honour the memory of Giuseppe Verdi. It was extensively restored between 1992 and 1997 and re-opened with about 1,300 seats and with a \"Viva Verdi\" concert which included excerpts from many of the composer's operas. (Like the restoration of La Scala between 2001 and 2004, a temporary alternative venue was quickly created in Trieste and the \"Sala Tripcovich\" continues to offer space for chamber opera and operettas.)\n\nA major feature of the Teatro Verdi's programming in the past 40 years, which stems from the original Austrian occupation of the city in the 19th century and the fact that Trieste did not become part of Italy until 1918, is the \"International Festival of Operetta\" which takes place every summer.\n\nThe theatre has seen the world premieres of the following operas:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27670737", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27670737", "title": "The Flower Girl", "text": "The Flower Girl\n\nThe Flower Girl () is a North Korean revolutionary genre theatrical performance, which was written by the country's sole President Kim Il-sung according to official North Korean sources. The performance is considered one of the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\", a group of classical, revolution-themed opera repertoires well received within North Korea. It was also made into a novel. A film adaption of the opera starring Hong Yong-hee was made in 1972.\n\nThe story is set during the 1930s, and is based on the anti-Japanese guerrilla movement during the period of Japanese occupation in Korea. A poor, rural girl, around whom the plot is centred, picks flowers on the mountain every day to sell at the market, to care for her ill mother. Additionally, she has a blind sister, and her father is deceased. Her mother is in debt to the landlord, and is bankrupt and unable to purchase food. The landlord's subordinates frequently harass the girl and call for her to work for them, to which her mother refuses. The girl then finds her blind sister attempting to earn money by singing on the street, to her anger.\n\nEventually, she collects enough money to purchase medicine for her ill mother, but by the time she returns, her mother has already died. The landlord's wife becomes very sick, and suspects that the flower girl's blind sister is possessed by the spirit of her deceased mother, and so arranges for her to be frozen to death in the snow. When the flower girl returns home and asks where her sister has gone, the landlord's subordinates chain her up. At this moment, her brother, who has joined the Revolutionary Army, returns home to visit family when he realises that the flower girl has been locked up, and so organises a group of villagers to overthrow the landlord.\n\n\"The Flower Girl\" is based on a play written by Kim Il-sung in the 1930s while he was imprisoned by the Japanese, in Jilin. The first section of his 1992 memoir \"With the Century\", entitled \"Anti-Japanese Revolution\", notes that:\nThere was a time during our country's independence movement where we held on to our vision to build an \"ideal village\" concept... At the time, we adopted the Korean students in Jilin to teach village people to sing a large variety of revolutionary songs, such as the \"Red Flag Song\" and \"Revolution Song\". In Wujiazi we formed a performance group based at Samsong school led by Kye Yong-chun. It was during this time that I was completing the script for \"The Flower Girl\", which I had started whilst I was in Jilin City. Upon finishing the script, production of the opera began, and we staged the opera in the Samsong school hall on the 13th anniversary of the October Revolution. For many years after liberation, the opera hadn't been performed since, until it was improved and adapted for film, and re-written as a novel, under the guidance of the Organising Secretary (Kim Jong-il) and released in the early 1970s.\nAlthough it is commonly stated that Kim Il-sung was the sole author of the production, many critics in China cast doubts over the reliability of the claim, and suggest that other North Korean writers may have also had some form of interaction in the opera's production.\n\nThe first official premiere of the opera production was held on November 30, 1972 in Pyongyang, where it was hailed as a great success.\n\nAccording to official North Korean reports, in April 1968, Kim Jong-il suggested that another revolutionary opera, \"Sea of Blood\", be adapted for a film. Since then, other works have also been adapted into movies \"under his guidance\", including \"The Flower Girl\". The opera was intended to promote the communist ideology, by incorporating themes such as the class struggle against the bourgeois; such themes were similarly maintained in the film.\n\nIn April 1972, the film adaptation was officially launched. The film was directed by Choe Ik-kyu and the script was written by Pak Hak; \"Paekdu-san Group\" was responsible for the production of the film.\n\nAccording to Paul Fischer, the author of \"A Kim Jong-Il Production\", \"it is almost impossible to exaggerate\" the importance of \"The Flower Girl\" to North Korea's cultural history. The film was immensely popular both domestically and abroad, particularly in China. It was the first North Korean film to win an international film award, at the 18th Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 1972, and remained the only one until the 1980s.\n\nThe opera and its film adaptation were both well received in the People's Republic of China when they were introduced there since September 9, 1972, predominantly during the closing period of the Cultural Revolution and the beginning of the era of Deng Xiaoping's rule, where the production was known by the name of \"The Flower-selling Girl\" (). A number of theatrical tours were made in China, which were performed in 1973, 1998, 2002 and 2008. In 2009, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao was received by Hong Yong-hee during his visit to North Korea. In China, the film adaptation of the opera was dubbed by the Changchun Film Studio, based on translations by , who was earlier responsible in 1958 in the translation of the North Korean film adaptation of \"Chunhyangjeon\". The entire translation process for \"The Flower Girl\" took only seven days. Although the dialogue was dubbed in Mandarin Chinese, song lyrics remained in Korean. As the film was played in Chinese cinemas during the period of the Cultural Revolution, the movie became immensely popular due to its proletarian revolution-based content, to the point where theaters even adopted a 24-hour screening cycle because of high ticket sales.\n\nAs of 2008, the opera has been performed over 1,400 times in North Korea and more than 40 other countries, mostly Eastern Bloc states; other countries include France, Italy, Germany, Algeria and Japan. The title of the opera and film was known as \"Blomsterflickan\" in Sweden, \"Das Blumenmädchen\" in the German Democratic Republic, \"Kvetinárka\" in Czechoslovakia, and \"Kwiaciarka\" in Poland.\n\nIn South Korea, the film was deemed as communist propaganda and a symbol of the enemy, and screening was banned; police were often mobilised when university students were found playing the film on campus, and the students were often accused of being sympathetic with the North. In 1998, the Supreme Court of South Korea ruled that \"The Flower Girl\" and six other North Korean films were \"not favouring anti-ROK sentiments\" in regards to national security laws.\n\nThe film forged Hong Yong-hee into a film icon. She is depicted on the North Korean one won banknote, in her role as the flower girl. The film made Choe Ik-kyu, the director, a confidant of Kim Jong-il.\n\n\n\n"}

It began operations in April 2000 and closed in 2005. The website was founded by Bruce Forman and Eric Eisner, son of Michael Eisner. The site was known for its raunchy, politically incorrect content, and its target demographic (described by Eisner as \"people who watch \"South Park\", listen to Howard Stern and read \"Maxim\") were males aged 16 to 25.\n\nEric Eisner and Bruce Forman met at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, where they both earned their MBA degrees in June of 1999. They got the idea for a site targeting young men during their final months at UCLA. Eisner and Forman were 26 and 28 respectively when they put up the initial seed money for Romp.com in 2000 and followed that by drawing in $15 million from private investors. The site attracted nearly 200,000 users during its first six weeks. The company had 35 employees at one point, though it downsized to 14 in the fall of 2000. By March of 2001, Romp.com had 600,000 registered users. Romp.com started a subscription service called \"The Romp Mafia\" in March 2001, attracting 11,000 subscribers in its first three weeks.\n\nRomp.com was primarily known for its flash animation video series. The site also featured message boards (called \"spew boards\"), chat rooms, and softcore images of women. Some of Romp.com's web series included:\n\nRomp.com quickly began to expand from the web to a full-fledged entertainment company. In the fall of 2000, Romp.com signed a development deal with Mandalay Sports Entertainment to produce reality game shows. Two projects developed by the company included \"Peephole\", which involved people on the street being offered money to do outrageous things while contestants bet on how far the people on the street will go to get the money, and \"The Hunt\", which followed contestants on a cross-country scavenger hunt, but neither made it to the air.\n\nRomp.com signed a deal with H&S Media to create a mini-magazine of repurposed content to accompany H&S's \"Maxim\"-esque men's magazine \"The Edge\". Romp.com was in final talks with H&S to create a standalone Romp magazine, but that never came to fruition when H&S went bankrupt in fall of 2001.\n\nAfter downsizing four employees and cutting the site's staff to 11, Forman announced plans for Romp.com to shift its focus from original web programming to traditional media in May 2001, concluding \"it is mission impossible to make money off the Internet with original programming.\"\n\nRomp.com's production company offshoot, Romp Studios, independently produced \"Jake's Booty Call\", a feature-length version of the site's popular series \"Booty Call\", in 2003. The film, which was co-written and co-directed by Eric Eisner and \"Booty Call\" co-creator/star Julian Max Metter, was acquired by National Lampoon for distribution.\n\n"}

In the 1953 Hollywood film version, \"Tom, Dick or Harry\" was performed by Ann Miller (as Bianca), Tommy Rall (as Lucentio), Bobby Van (as Gremio) and Bob Fosse (as Hortensio).\n\nIn this song, during a musical performance of Shakespeare's \"Taming of the Shrew\" (the subplot of \"Kate\"), three suitors (Gremio, Lucentio and Hortensio) compete to win Bianca's affections (Gremio claiming wealth; Hortensio offering social standing; and Lucentio with a promise of love). Whereas other songs from \"Kiss Me, Kate\" (such as \"So in Love\" and \"Too Darn Hot\") were released as singles and achieved commercial success outside the show (\"So in Love\" reached the top ten on the Hit Parade in 1949 and has since been covered by scores of recording artists), \"Tom, Dick or Harry\" was written expressly to advance the \"Shrew\" subplot and is, therefore, a showtune in the truest sense of the word. This is why many studio (non-cast) recordings of \"Kiss Me, Kate\" do not include the song. Perhaps the best-known example of this is Frank Sinatra's \"Kiss Me, Kate\" studio album which is part of his four album (four show) project that also includes \"Finian's Rainbow\" (1947), \"South Pacific\" (1949) and \"Guys and Dolls\" (1950) and which he produced in 1963 to promote his fledgling label, Reprise Records; hence the project title, the star-studded \"Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre\".\n\nIn 1990, theatre historian Miles Krueger conducted an interview with Patricia Morison (who originated the title role in \"Kate\") to discuss the original production as well as the six songs dropped from the show prior to the Broadway opening. When asked about one of the deleted songs, \"If Ever Married I'm\", Morison responded by stating: \"That was for Bianca. It was replaced by 'Tom, Dick or Harry' which tells the same story\".\n\nOn May 18, 2000, \"Tom, Dick or Harry\" was performed on NBC-TV's \"Today\" show by 1999 Broadway revival cast members Amy Spanger (as Bianca), Michael Berresse (as Lucentio), Kevin Neal McCready (as Gremio) and Darren Lee (as Hortensio) as a result of the show's having garnered the greatest number of Tony nominations (with twelve nominations) for that year.\nHost Matt Lauer introduced the four performers outside on Manhattan's Rockefeller Plaza, interviewing Spanger and Berresse, while co-host Katie Couric remained in the studio. The Broadway revival of \"Kate\" went on to become the top winning show at the 54th Tony Awards (the only show to garner five or more Tonys).\n"}

An outsider may wonder what everyone is doing running all day long within and outside (usually nearby) the town of Rethymno, on foot, by bike or by car.

Apparently, it is not uncommon for those caught up in the hate to physically assault or throw things at the telescreen, as Julia does during the scene.\n\nThe film becomes more surreal as it progresses, with Goldstein's face morphing into a sheep as enemy soldiers advance on the viewers, before one such soldier charges at the screen, submachine gun blazing. He morphs, finally, into the face of Big Brother at the end of the two minutes. At the end, the mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted viewers chant \"B-B!...B-B!\" over and over again, ritualistically.\n\nWithin the book, the purpose of the Two Minutes Hate is to satisfy the citizens' subdued feelings of angst and hatred from leading such a wretched, controlled existence. By re-directing these subconscious feelings away from the Oceanian government and toward external enemies (which may not even exist), the Party minimises subversive thought and behaviour.\n\nIn the first Two Minutes Hate of the book, the audience is introduced to Inner Party member and key character O'Brien. Within the novel, hate week is an extrapolation of the two-minute period into an annual week-long festival.\n\nOrwell did not invent the idea behind the term \"two minutes hate\"; it was already in use in the First World War. At that time, British writers satirised the German campaign of hatred against the English, and imagined a Prussian family sitting around the kitchen table having its \"morning hate\".\n\nIn addition, short daily artillery bombardments made by either side during the First World War, and aimed at disrupting enemy routines, were known as \"hates\":\n\nThe attacks on the liberal opposition by state-owned Russian television channels such as Russia-1 have been characterised as reminiscent of the \"two minutes hate\". Russian television portrayed Ukrainian troops as monsters during the War in Donbass. One of the most notorious examples was a 2014 hoax report on Channel One Russia that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a three-year-old.\n\nAmerican propaganda by the Committee on Public Information during World War I has also been compared to the propaganda in the \"two minutes hate\" program.\n\n"}
{"id": "44546139", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=44546139", "title": "Zero Robotics", "text": "Zero Robotics\n\nZero Robotics is an international high school programming competition where students control robotic SPHERES (Synchronised Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites) aboard the International Space Station. Each year teams of students work to produce code capable to performing in a game which can be deployed on the SPHERES. This game generally contains elements such as docking with objects, moving objects and destroying targets within a bounded area while monitoring fuel usage.\n\nInitial stages of the competition occur online (with virtual SPHERES) with free team registration in the United States, Australia and for ESA member countries and limited registration for international teams. Teams are traditionally monitored by adult mentors and code submitted through the MIT website. Finalists compete in a live championship aboard the ISS. An astronaut conducts the final competition while communicating to teams through a live feed.\n\nThe Zero Robotics competition was created by NASA Astronaut Gregory Chamitoff when he was working with the SPHERES and realised that the coding interface would be suitable for high school students. Drawing inspiration from FIRST Robotics, Zero Robotics became a competition that emphasised building science, technology, engineering, and maths skills with a component of cooperation between schools and nations. It's inaugural competition was held in 2009, expansion to the entire US in 2010 and internationally in 2013. It currently includes schools from the US, Russia, ESA affiliated states and Australia.\n\nThe Zero Robotics competition is divided into two types of tournaments.\n\n\nAdditionally some countries, notably Australia and Italy, choose to hold preliminary competitions to fit better into the school year and/or filter the schools going onto the International Competition.\n\nParticipants compete together to win a technically challenging game, motivated by a problem of current interest to DARPA, NASA and MIT. Depending on the challenge, students must program their satellites to complete certain objectives (to avoid obstacles, collect virtual objects, destroy targets, etc.) while preserving the primary resources (fuel, energy charges, etc.) and complete the challenge within certain limits of time and space for writing code. The student's software must be able to control factors such as the speed of the satellite, the rotation, the direction of travel, and many others, to be able to find the perfect algorithm to achieve the purpose and meet the challenges in the shortest possible time than their opponents.\n\nThe difficulty lies in the fact that the programs are autonomous in the sense that submitted code will last for the duration of the competition (and across multiple matches) and you can not control or modify their execution. Additionally there is a limit on the programmable memory of the SPHERES, limiting the available coding practices.\nParticipants in Zero Robotics are encouraged to learn and/or improve their knowledge related to basic physics, since optimal algorithms require precise control over forces influencing the speed of the SPHERES. However, students report that \"good results [can be obtained] by working exclusively through imposition of the satellite coordinates\".\n\nParticipants in the challenge Zero Robotics learn to program in a language-like C / C++, or MATLAB, or (in the middle school competition) Scratch. Within these languages there are different APIs to enforce the main parameters of the movements of the satellite. A specialised IDE is offered online on the official website of the competition where students are able submit and save their code.\n\n 2017 LifeSphere ISS Finals\n\nAlliance: LakeElevenVADARS\n\n2013 CosmoSPHERES ISS Finals\n\nAlliance: y0b0tics!
