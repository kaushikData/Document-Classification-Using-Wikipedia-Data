{"id": "19046394", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19046394", "title": "Anya (Anastasia)", "text": "Anya (Anastasia)\n\nAnastasia is the fictional character from the 1997 Fox Animation Studios film of the same name, and a fictional version of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. She is voiced by Meg Ryan, while Liz Callaway provides her singing voice. She is the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia (\"Anya\"), the youngest daughter and one of two surviving members of the Imperial family.\n\n\"The New York Times\" describes her thus: \"\"Anastasia\" stops just short of making its title character a blonde. (She, like many of the other characters has auburn hair.) Otherwise, she has the slender curving body and peachy complexion of a small-town Miss America contestant dreaming of conquest in Atlantic City. Meg Ryan's voice gives her the slightly combative tone of a snippy, know-it-all cheerleader. In a beauty contest, she would definitely be docked points for lack of charm.\"\n\nAnya first appears in the film \"Anastasia\" as a girl at an orphanage who has vague recollections about life before she arrived. She goes on a quest to find out about her past. In St. Petersberg she meets con-men Dimitri and Vladimir who try to dress her up to turn her into the Princess Anastasia, because her grandmother Maria Feodorovna (Empress Marie) is offering a reward to anyone who reunites her with her granddaughter (who became lost after the palace was stormed and the royal family was killed). However, Dimitri and Vladimir are unaware that Anya actually is Anastasia. Unfortunately, the evil Rasputin knows the truth about Anya and tries to kill her. However, he ultimately fails. Anya is reunited with her grandmother near the end of the film, and is offered the chance to be a princess. Anya eventually elopes with Dimitri and leaves a note for her grandmother promising to return after their honeymoon.\n\nAnya has a slender frame and slightly tanned skin, along with long flowing auburn hair and blue eyes. Unlike most animated heroines, she wears many outfits throughout the movie. She starts off the movie clad in a ragged yellow tunic and black tights under a green overcoat. Once she is en route to Paris, however, she wears a short-sleeved blue dress given to her by Dimitri. After showcasing a series of flapper-inspired outfits, Anya wears a strapless navy blue evening gown with her hair up. At the end, when Anya is now known to be the Princess Anastasia, she wears an elaborate gold court dress, complete with a glittering diamond kokoshnik.\n\nReelViews wrote that Anya is \"easily the strongest, most independent animated female to grace the screen, surpassing even Belle for spunk. Meg Ryan is perfect for this role.\" SFGate said \"it's worth noting Ryan's stunning job -- she sounds pert, feisty, fun. Everything audiences liked about Ryan in, say, \"Sleepless in Seattle,\" they'll like about her here.\" CNN says the character is \"perkily voiced by Meg Ryan,\" though adds \"much of the drawing for Anya and Dimitri is flat.\" Philly.com says the character is \"strongly voiced in a jarringly contemporary American accent by Meg Ryan.\"\n\nScreenIt argues \"The plot also has a few inexplicable, but key elements. It's never fully or convincingly explained why Anya can't remember her childhood (she was eight-years-old, after all, when the revolution took place), beyond what we assume was an amnesia inducing fall at a train station. Likewise, it seems odd that Rasputin would assume that Anastasia died during the revolution when his last glimpse of her was as he slid underwater to his death.\" Entertainment Weekly argues \"The story's somber emotional hook — Anastasia's thwarted desire for home — is asserted rather than dramatized. (This may have something to do with the fact that she's cast out of the palace before we've had a chance to enjoy her being there.)\"\n\n"}
{"id": "19930324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19930324", "title": "BabelCon", "text": "BabelCon\n\nBabelCon was a science fiction and multigenre convention, held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Established in 2006, the convention took place at the Cook Hotel and Lod & Carole Cook Alumni Center on the campus of Louisiana State University. Formerly a project of the non-profit Science & Engineering Education Foundation (SEEF), it was last managed by Babelcon LLC. After a split between the organizers in late 2010, the upcoming convention was postponed then ultimately cancelled.\n\nThis convention was typically a three-day event comprising panels, seminars, demonstrations, and workshops. Guests sometimes include science fiction and fantasy authors, artists, and celebrities from genre television series and movies. BabelCon was named for the site of a diplomatic conference in the classic \"\" episode \"Journey to Babel\".\n\nBabelCon was launched in 2006, as a project of a local science fiction and gaming group, Star One Delta (SOD). The organizers were inspired to create BabelCon after Crescent City Con in New Orleans ended a 20-year run in 2005 and, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, efforts to launch a new convention in New Orleans were stalled. In 2008, BabelCon was legally separated from Star One Delta, and a new non-profit organization, the Science & Engineering Education Foundation (SEEF), was created to run the convention.\n\nBabelCon was held on Saturday, August 5, 2006, at the West Baton Rouge Conference Center in Port Allen, Louisiana. Notable guests at the one-day event included \"Lost In Space\" actor Bob May.\n\nBabelCon 2 was held on Saturday, August 4, 2007 at the West Baton Rouge Conference Center in Port Allen, Louisiana. Activities included gaming, a fantasy art show, science panels, and celebrity guests. Notable guests at the one-day event included \"Star Trek\" actors Lee Meriwether and Robert O'Reilly as well as several local authors and fan groups.\n\nBabelCon 3 was held on July 19–20, 2008, at the Holiday Inn Select in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The two-day event featured guest stars Richard Hatch, Suzie Plakson, J. G. Hertzler, and Bob May, paranormal investigators Kalila Katherina Smith and Brad Duplechein, plus several local authors and educators. Attendance was estimated to be about 1000 fans.\n\nBabelCon 4 was held on July 17–19, 2009, at the Cook Hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Guest stars at the three-day event included Rekha Sharma, Tiffany Grant, Patrick Burns, as well as several local authors and educators. Convention staff said attendance was \"down slightly from past years\".\n\nBabelCon 4.5 was held on March 19–21, 2010, at the Cook Hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Originally listed as \"BabelCon 2010 - the Year We Make Contact\" it was changed to a \"mini-con\" and given the designation of \"4.5\". The convention aimed at \"a cozy con atmosphere\" relying on panels rather than celebrity guests for entertainment. Scaled back due to economic pressures from the late-2000s recession, the event featured Sal Lizard, the president of Starfleet International, as its headline guest. As in previous conventions local authors also gave talks and spoke with guests.\n\nThe next BabelCon event was originally scheduled to be held March 25–27, 2011, but was postponed. After a split in convention management in late 2010, many of the original BabelCon staff and organizers planned their own event after the BabelCon name was registered with the Louisiana Secretary of State by another individual. This event, the Louisiana Science Fiction and Costuming Festival, was first held March 25–27, 2011.\n\nIn April 2012, new management acquired the assets of Babelcon LLC to settle existing debts and allow the event to move forward. Due to funding issues and another change in management, Babelcon was tentatively rescheduled for mid-October 2012. The convention was eventually cancelled and the organization dispersed.\n"}
{"id": "4179046", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4179046", "title": "Battle of the Maule", "text": "Battle of the Maule\n\nThe Battle of the Maule was fought between the Mapuche people of Chile and the Inca Empire of Peru in what is now the Maule River, Chile. The three-day battle, which is generally believed to have occurred in the reign of Tupac Inca Yupanqui (1471-93 CE), marked the end of the Incas' southward expansion.\n\nIn a six-year campaign with an army that eventually rose to 50,000 men, the Inca general Sinchiruca had subdued the regions of northern Chile, Copiapó, Coquimbo, Aconcagua and the Maipo Valley around what is now Santiago. After securing the Maipo Valley Sinchiruca sent 20,000 men down to the valley of the Maule River. The territory of the Picunche people inhabiting this last region south of Maipo Valley extended further to the south to the Itata River and these people the south of the Maipo Valley had refused to submit to the rule of the Inca and called on their allies south of the Maule; the Antalli, Pincu, and Cauqui to join in opposing these invaders. This defiance gave them their distinctive name of Purumaucas from Quechua \"purum awqa\" meaning \"savage enemy\". The Spanish later enhanced the name into Promaucaes.\n\nThe Incas crossed the Maule River, and keeping their old custom, they sent messengers to require these Purumaucas to submit to the rule of the Inca or resort to arms. The Purumaucas had determined to die before losing their freedom, and responded that the victors would be masters of the defeated and that the Incas would quickly see how the Purumaucas obeyed. Three or four days after this answer, the Purumaucas and their allies arrived and camped in front of the Incas' camp with 18,000 - 20,000 warriors. The Incas tried diplomacy, offering peace and friendship, claiming they were not going to take their land and property but to give them a way to live as men. The Purumaucas responded saying that they came not to waste time in vain words and reasoning, but to fight until they won or died. The Incas promised battle the next day.\n\nThe following day both armies left their camps and fought all day without either gaining an advantage, and both suffering many wounded and dead. At night they both retired to their positions. On the second and third day they fought with the same results. At the end of the third day of battle both factions saw that they had lost more than half their number in dead, and the living were almost all wounded. On the fourth day, neither side left their own camp, which had been fortified, as they hoped to defend them if their opponents attacked. The fifth and sixth days were passed in the same manner but by the seventh the Purumaucas and their allies retired and returned home claiming victory.\n\n"}
{"id": "617383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617383", "title": "Burial at sea", "text": "Burial at sea\n\nBurial at sea is the disposal of human remains in the ocean, normally from a ship or boat. It is regularly performed by navies, and is done by private citizens in many countries.\n\nBurial-at-sea services are conducted at many different locations and with many different customs, either by ship or by aircraft. Usually, either the captain (or ) of the ship or aircraft or a religious representative (of the decedent's religion or the state religion) performs the ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony may include burial in a casket, burial sewn in sailcloth, burial in an urn, or scattering of the cremated remains from a ship. Burial at sea by aircraft is usually done only with cremated remains. Other types of burial at sea include the mixing of the ashes with concrete and dropping the concrete block to form an artificial reef such as the Atlantis Reef.\n\nBelow is a list of religions that allow burial at sea, with some details of the burial.\n\nThere are very few traditional Buddhist burials at sea. Traditionally, the deceased are cremated and the ashes are placed in a grave or columbarium. Particularly in East Asian or Mahayana Buddhism, a physical gravesite is considered important for the conduct of memorial and ancestor rites. The Buddhist Churches of America, the North American branch of Japanese Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, has created a service for Buddhist burials at sea, primarily for military service members. In Thailand ashes are generally placed in a wreath with lit candles and floated off to sea from a vessel followed by a procession of mourning wreaths, with lit candles also.\n\nOfficially, the Roman Catholic Church prefers normal casket burials over cremations, but does allow for cremation subject to the condition that the ashes are entombed or buried. Catholics believe it is not proper to scatter or pour the cremated remains over the sea, water, or on the land. According to the Roman Catholic Church this action does not give due respect to the remains of the deceased, nor does it allow for the closure and healing of family and friends. Likewise they see that the custom of housing the remains with family or friends and not placing the deceased in the ground does not offer loved ones a specific and sacred place to visit the individual. Visiting the deceased in a holy place provides believers with a space to offer prayers, commune with those who have gone before them in faith, and reminds them to await the resurrection of their own bodies. Burial at sea in a casket or in an urn is approved for cases where the deceased expired in the sea. The committal prayer number 406§4 is used in this case.\n\nThe Anglican Communion has detailed procedures for burial at sea. The ship has to be stopped, and the body has to be sewn in canvas, suitably weighted. Anglican (and other) chaplains of the Royal Navy bury cremated remains of ex-Naval personnel at sea. Scattering of cremated remains is discouraged, not least for practical reason\n\nThe Book of Common Prayer (1928) of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States (ECUSA), a member of the Anglican Communion provides a specific prayer of committal for burials at sea:\n\nAt the Burial of the Dead at Sea.\nThe same Office may be used; but instead of the Sentence of Committal, the Minister shall say:\nMany Lutheran naval veterans and seamen prefer to be buried at sea. In those cases either the casket or urn is set to sea, or ashes scattered. The procedure is similar as that with the Anglican church. Some parishes have specific consecrated sea areas where ashes can be sprinkled.\n\nTraditionally, the deceased are cremated, the bones and ashes are collected, and the ashes/remains are immersed in the Ganges River if possible or in any other river if not.\n\nThe sacred texts of Islam prefer burial on land, \"so deep that its smell does not come out and the beasts of prey do not dig it out\". However, if a person dies at sea and it is not possible to bring the body back to land before decay, or if burial at land becomes impossible, burial at sea is allowed. A weight is tied to the feet of the body, and the body is lowered into the water. This would preferably occur in an area where the remains are not immediately eaten by scavengers.\n\nIn the Sunni Fiqh book \"Umdat al-Salik wa Uddat al-Nasik\", the condition for sea burial is:\n\nAccording to Jewish law, a dead person must be quickly buried and burial requires covering in earth. This law is derived from Devarim (Deuteronomy) 21:23 \"Bury, you will bury him the same day; for the (unburied body) is a curse to God\" the double command to bury causing a positive commandment to entomb in the earth and a negative commandment forbidding leaving an unburied body. The legal text Shulchan Aruch brings a case example explaining that even if a person is known to have drowned in a closed body of water such as a small pond where there can be certainty that the victim had not somehow survived, the family does not begin ritual mourning and remains in extended state of most intense mourning aninut until either the body is found or after an exhaustive search despairs of recovering and burying the body. This shows that the body is considered unburied when underwater; as shiva mourning normally only begins after burial. B'resheit(Genesis) 3:19 states \"With the sweat of your face you shall eat bread, until you return to the ground, from (dust) you were taken and you are dust, and to dust you will return.\" From this we see that the only proper treatment of a dead body is to physically cover it with earth once land is available for the crew to bury the body, rather than to leave the body at sea or some other fate such as cremation.\n\nIf for some reason the body of someone deceased aboard a ship causes an immediate life threat to those aboard the vessel the commandment to protect innocent life or pikuach nefesh overrides nearly all commandments including the command to bury the dead, as any appropriate actions to ensure safety of surviving crew are required to be taken which may include jettisoning a body at sea without burial. However, attempts would later be made to recover and bury when possible without life hazard.\n\nAn example of the desire to bury a body in the ground even after it has been long dead at sea, is that of the Israeli submarine \"Dakar\" which was lost with no survivors in 1968 but was only discovered in 1999 lying broken at a depth of 3,000 meters. Search and recovery of any potentially existing remains at this very difficult to access depth has not shown results despite requests from family and the Chief Rabbi of the IDF.\n\nBurial at sea within Australian territorial waters, exclusive economic zone and continental shelf is covered by the \"Environmental Protection (Sea Dumping Act) 1981\" administered by the federal Department of the Environment. A permit is required for burial of bodies at sea. Permits are usually only granted in cases of a strong connection to the sea, such as long-serving navy personnel. The body must not be embalmed or placed in a casket, it may only be sewn into a weighted shroud. The burial must be in water deeper than and not interfere with shipping, fishing or undersea communications. Australian Defence Force vessels engaged in armed conflicts or emergency situations are exempt from these requirements.\n\nNo permit is required to scatter ashes at sea.\n\nBurial at sea was a method hypothetically suggested by the then Medical Officer of Health for Liverpool, Dr Duncan Dolton, in which unburied bodies could be buried at sea during any extended strike by gravediggers union the GMWU during the 1978–79 Winter of Discontent. The suggestion caused great alarm amongst the public and helped prompt a resolution to the strike. British colonial burials at sea of the 18th and 19th century involved wrapping the deceased in sailcloth weighted with cannonballs.\n\nIn England, cremated remains may be scattered freely at sea but a burial must be made in a coffin meeting regulatory requirements and in one of three locations: off The Needles, Isle of Wight; between Hastings and Newhaven; and off Tynemouth, North Tyneside. Permission may be sought for another burial site. Some funeral directors will arrange the event, and the Britannia Shipping Company specialises in it. Charity organisation the Maritime Volunteer Service also helps carry out burials at sea.\n\nIn Scotland, there are two designated sites for burial at sea. These are 210 miles due west of Oban and 15 miles west of John O'Groats.\n\nA funeral director is not required for the burial of cremated remains at sea. However, full body burials require specific preparation to ensure the body or coffin sinks quickly, and in many states a licensed funeral director is required. The Environmental Protection Agency regulations for full body burials at sea in the United States require that the site of interment be from land and at a depth of at least . California prohibits whole body burial within its state-asserted three-mile limit. Off the eastern coast of the United States, the closest sufficient depths are off Long Island (), Ocracoke (), and Miami (). This may require travel in excess of for a suitable site.\n\nDeparting from the New England area requires a voyage of c. 45 miles to sea to reach the required 600 ft ocean depth. Sufficient depth is within 10 miles or less at many harbors along the U.S. west coast, including San Diego, Santa Barbara, Monterey, Fort Bragg, Eureka, and Crescent City, all in California. The United States Navy inters intact remains from Norfolk and San Diego only. The United States Navy requires a metal casket for intact remains, but full body burial in a suitably weighted shroud is also seen as legal.\n\nThe United States is similar to many countries which permit the spreading of cremation ashes within their Exclusive Economic zone: when spreading ashes from a ship which is registered in a different country, the regulations and reporting procedures for the ship's flag state need to be complied with once the vessel is in international waters, that is, outside 12 nautical miles. Ships follow the London convention principles, as opposed to MARPOL regulations, as the ash is intentionally taken on board for discharge at sea, as opposed to ash generated on passage from the ship's incinerators. It should be further considered that on 1 January 2013, MARPOL Annex V came into force, which prevents discharge of a ship's incinerator ash.\n\nThe United States Navy has performed many burials at sea in its history, with wartime burials as recently as World War II, and peacetime burials still common. Enemy deaths received the same ceremony as Americans or allies. Most other armed forces also perform burials at sea, such as the British Royal Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nIf the deceased died on land or has been returned to shore after death, the remains may be brought aboard either in a coffin or in an urn after cremation. The ceremony is performed while the ship is deployed, and consequently civilians are not allowed to be present. In the US, people eligible for a free Navy burial at sea are:\n\nIn preparation, the officer of the deck calls \"All hands bury the dead\", and the ship is stopped (if possible). The ship's flags are lowered to half mast. The ship's crew, including a firing party, casket bearers and a bugler, are assembled on the deck. The crew stands at parade rest at the beginning of the ceremony. The coffin is covered with a flag, and is carried feet first on deck by the casket bearers. The casket is placed on a stand, with the feet overboard. In case of cremated remains, the urn is brought on deck and placed on a stand.\n\nThe ceremony is divided into a military portion and a religious portion. The religious part is specific to the religion of the deceased, and may be performed by a Navy chaplain, or by the commanding officer if no chaplain of the appropriate faith is available. A scripture is read and prayers are said.\n\nAfter the religious ceremony, the firing party is ordered \"Firing party, present arms\". The casket bearers tilt the platform with the casket, so that the casket slides off the platform into the ocean. The flag which was draped over the casket is retained on board. For cremated remains, there is the option to bury the remains using the urn in a similar fashion to the procedure used for caskets. Alternatively, the urn can be opened, and the remains scattered in the wind. In this case, the wind direction has to be taken under consideration before burial to ensure a smooth procedure.\n\nThe firing party fires a three volley salute, the bugler plays Taps, and flowers may also be dropped into the ocean. After the flag is folded, the ceremony ends. The relatives are informed of the time and location of the burial, and given photos and video recordings if available.\n\nIn wartime, attempts are made for burial at sea to follow the same procedure as for peacetime burial at sea, although a ship on a combat mission may not have all the necessary resources available. Nowadays, it is usually possible to airlift the remains back to shore, and prepare a burial ceremony on land. However, as recently as the Falklands War, deceased were buried at sea without returning to land. Due to the limited facilities of military ships, this procedure usually does not include a casket, but the body is sewn into a sailcloth with weights, usually rocks or cannonballs. Cremation is usually not possible on a ship. During the Pacific campaign there was at least one instance where a member of an aircrew was buried at sea in his damaged aircraft, which was ceremonially pushed overboard from an aircraft carrier.\n\nIf no remains of the deceased are available a memorial service may be held, and flowers may be dropped in the water, often over or near the location of the death.\n\nA few notable burials at sea:\n\n"}

Soviet leader Joseph Stalin did not attend the conference because his meeting with Chiang could have caused friction between the Soviet Union and Japan. (The Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact of 1941 was a five-year agreement of neutrality between the two nations; in 1943 the Soviet Union was not at war with Japan, whereas China, the U.K. and the U.S. were.)\n\nThe Cairo meeting was held at a residence of the American Ambassador to Egypt, Alexander Kirk, near the Pyramids.\n\nTwo days later Stalin met with Roosevelt and Churchill in Tehran, Iran for the Tehran Conference.\n\nThe Americans not wanting the French to return to Indochina, had offered Chiang Kai-Shek entire control of French Indochina, but Chiang Kai-Shek publicly declined.\n\nThe Cairo Declaration was issued on 27 November 1943 and released in a \"Cairo Communiqué\" through radio on 1 December 1943, stating the Allies' intentions to continue deploying military force until Japan's unconditional surrender.

All but two of those aboard were Royal Navy personnel; the exceptions were two civilian botanists engaged to supervise the breadfruit plants \"Bounty\" was tasked to take from Tahiti to the West Indies. Of the 44 aboard at the time of the mutiny, 19 (including Bligh) were set adrift in the ship's launch, while 25, a mixture of mutineers and detainees, remained on board under Fletcher Christian. Bligh led his loyalists to safety in the open boat, and ultimately back to England. The mutineers divided—most settled on Tahiti, where they were captured by in 1791 and returned to England for trial, while Christian and eight others evaded discovery on Pitcairn Island.\n\nThe Admiralty rated \"Bounty\" as a cutter, the smallest category of warship—this meant that she was commanded not by a captain but by a lieutenant, with no other commissioned officers aboard, and without the usual detachment of Royal Marines that ships' commanders could use to enforce their authority. Directly beneath Bligh in the chain of command were his warrant officers, appointed by the Navy Board and headed by the sailing master John Fryer. The other warrant officers were the boatswain, the surgeon, the carpenter, and the gunner. Two master's mates and two midshipmen were rated as petty officers; to these were added several honorary midshipmen—so-called \"young gentlemen\" who aspired to naval careers. They signed on the ship's roster as able seamen, but were quartered with the midshipmen and treated on equal terms with them.\n\nMost on \"Bounty\" were chosen by Bligh, or were recommended to him. However, a draft list of the crew before the voyage includes several who did not sail, including two pressed men who are thought to have deserted. Of the eventual crew William Peckover, the gunner, and Joseph Coleman, the armourer, had been with Bligh when he was Captain James Cook's sailing master on during the explorer's third voyage (1776–80). Several others had sailed under Bligh more recently, including Christian, who had twice voyaged with Bligh to the West Indies on the merchantman \"Britannia\". The two had formed a master-pupil relationship through which Christian had become a highly skilled navigator; Bligh gave him one of the master's mate's berths on \"Bounty\", and in March 1788 promoted him to the rank of Acting Lieutenant, effectively making Christian second-in-command. Another of the young gentlemen recommended to Bligh was 15-year-old Peter Heywood, a Manxman and a distant relation of Christian's. His recommendation came from Bligh's father-in-law, who was a Heywood family friend.\n\nThe two botanists, or \"gardeners\", were chosen by Sir Joseph Banks, the president of the Royal Society and the expedition's chief promoter. The chief botanist, David Nelson, was another veteran of Cook's third voyage and had learned some of the Tahitians' language. Nelson's assistant, William Brown, was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French. Banks also helped to secure the midshipmen's berths for two of his protégés, Thomas Hayward and John Hallett. Overall, \"Bounty\"'s crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30. At the time of departure Bligh was 33 years old and Fryer a year older. Among the older crew members were the gunner, William Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, formerly sailmaker on the \"Britannia\". The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, who were both 15 when they left England.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n"}

It is caused when there is narrowing of the coronary arteries and a coronary vasodilator is used – \"stealing\" blood away from those parts of the heart. This happens as a result of the narrowed coronary arteries being always maximally dilated to compensate for the decreased upstream blood supply. Thus, dilating the resistance vessels in the coronary circulation causes blood to be shunted away from the coronary vessels supplying the ischemic zones, creating more ischemia.\n\nIt is associated with dipyridamole. Hence, dipyridamole is a pharmacological success diagnostically, but a therapeutic failure because of the coronary steal phenomenon.\n\nCoronary steal is also the mechanism in most drug-based cardiac stress tests; When a patient is incapable of doing physical activity they are given a vasodilator that produces a \"cardiac steal syndrome\" as a diagnostic procedure. The test result is positive if the patient's symptoms reappear or if ECG alterations are seen.\n\nIt is also associated with the administration of Isoflurane, which is an inhaled anesthetic. Hydralazine can potentially cause this condition as well, as it is a direct arteriolar vasodilator.\n\nIt has been associated with nitroprusside.\n\nCoronary arteriovenous fistula between coronary artery and another cardiac chamber, like, the coronary sinus, right atrium, or right ventricle may cause steal syndrome under conditions like myocardial infarction and possible angina or ventricular arrhythmias, if the shunt is large in magnitude.\n\nIt can also be associated with new patterns of blood vessel growth.\nIt is sometimes treated by surgery.\n\n"}

The Act was modified, amended or extended by later legislation, for example the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883.\n\nCorrupt practices are now defined by the Representation of the People Act 1983 and include:\n\nThe result of an election can be challenged on the grounds that corrupt practices have taken place by the presentation of an election petition to the courts within the period of 21 days after the date of the election. If the election court which hears the petition determines that a corrupt practice has taken place, it issues a report finding the relevant individuals guilty. A candidate may be reported as personally guilty if they were directly involved with the corrupt practice, or if it was committed with their knowledge or consent. A candidate may also be reported as \"guilty by his agents\" where his election agent or those working on his campaign commit corrupt practices.\n\nThe punishments for corrupt practices fall into two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of a person as guilty of a corrupt practice renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revoked). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concerned), and anyone found guilty is subject to both criminal punishment and the non-criminal sanctions.\n\nThe successful election of a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a corrupt practice is void, and anyone found personally guilty of a corrupt practice is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) for a period of five years. In addition, if the offender is a solicitor, barrister, advocate or member of another regulated profession (such as a medical doctor) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with it as if it were professional misconduct, and thus could result in suspension or being struck off their professional register. If an election court finds that someone with a licence for the sale of alcohol allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.\n\nConviction of a corrupt practice in the criminal courts can result in imprisonment for up to two years (depending on the offence) or an unlimited fine.\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases of corrupt practices in recent years was that of the local government elections in the Bordesley Green and Aston wards of Birmingham in June 2004. The election court, presided over by Richard Mawrey QC, found that there had been extensive abuse of the postal vote system, resulting in the outcome of the election being changed. He accordingly reported that extensive corrupt practices had been committed, found six individuals personally guilty (although one was subsequently cleared by the Court of Appeal), and voided the elections.\n\nFollowing the 1997 General Election, Fiona Jones, who had been elected as Member of Parliament for Newark, and her election agent were initially tried and convicted of making false declaration regarding election expenses. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal.\n\n"}

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first published use of the term in English was in 1892.\nAn actual dance card is typically a booklet with a decorative cover, listing dance titles, composers, and the person with whom the woman intended to dance. Typically, it would have a cover indicating the sponsoring organization of the ball and a decorative cord by which it could be attached to a lady's wrist or ball gown. From the 19th century until World War I, dance cards for the elite of Austria-Hungary were often very elaborate, with some even incorporating precious metals and jewels. \n\nIn modern times the expression \"dance card\" is often used metaphorically, as when someone says \"pencil me into your dance card,\" meaning \"find some time to spend with me\". Conversely, someone's \"dance card is full\" implies that even though they may be interested, they have no time for another person.\n\nU.S. Air Force aircrews in general, and those involved in flight tests in particular, use the term to describe the first card in a \"deck\" of flight or test maneuver cards. The \"dance card\" contains administrative data about the mission, aircraft, and aircrew as well as a list of the maneuvers to be flown. The card serves as a table of contents for the mission and a quick reference for the aircrew's use during the flight.\n\n"}

The date is set according to the lunar Nepal Era calendar: it falls on the first day of the dark fortnight of the month of [Gunla].\n\nThe Festival of Cows is one of the most popular festivals of Nepal. It is celebrated to diminish the sadness from the death of family members. During the festival, cows are marched in the streets. People also distribute food to others. \n\n\nKathmandu is considered to be the main source of this festival as the king who started this festival was from this city. After the show presented to the queen was a success, it became an annual program to present the queen with this festival. As time passed on and as the kings and the queens passed on the festival has been passed on from generation to generation. In main Kathmandu, people celebrate it with much happiness and many programs than those on Patan. The procession goes around the city to different parts of the suburbs and the inner urban areas to present the devotion to their loved ones. The people involved in this profession get small packets with fruits, sweets, oats and other food items to help them on their tour around the city, by many people watching the festival and by their loved ones.\n\nPatan has a similar kind of following for this festival like that with Kathmandu but has less involvement of people than that on Kathmandu. People in Lalitpur have another festival similar to Gaijatra called \"Matayaa\" which is followed by Hindu with much more devotion and much more involvement by the people. The involvements of people in this \"Matayaa\" can be in thousands. Thus for people in Lalitpur, the procession of Gaijatra is less entertained.\n\nGaijatra is celebrated widely in Kirtipur, particularly in Kirtipur's ancient historical towns Kipu dey:, Panga:, Naga:, Bhajanga: and Yarwocha: (Itagol) and other towns. The people in Kirtipur celebrating have many reasons to celebrate this festival and have a unique way of celebrating this festival. Among the people of Kirtipur it is said that the gates of heaven for the dead are opened in this day, and the procession of Gaijatra will help their beloved to reach the gates of heaven if they march around the city for them. They march around the city of Kirtipur with not dressing up like cows but rather dressed up in different forms of gods and goddesses. People celebrate this festival not only for their dead relatives but also for peace and harmony among the family members and the city itself.\n\nDuring this month the farmers of the city finish up their work in the fields and return home to celebrate the ending of the hard and tedious work in the fields. They gather the family members and have a feast of their success. This culture is replicated in this festival in Kirtipur. Men dress up like women and travel around the city. They go from house to house calling up the owners of the house and asking them to come down and join in the feast with them. This helps to create harmony among the neighbors and the city members.\nKirtipur performs many dances with different imitating artists that provide much of an awe and a happiness among the people. Kirtipur is enriched with many beliefs and many stories relating Gaijatra than any other cities of the valley and has a more diverse celebration of this festival.\n\nBhaktapur is said to have the most enjoyable and exciting Gai Jatra, as it has its own peculiarities in the ways the festival is celebrated as compared to Lalitpur and Kathmandu. A chariot (known as Taha-Macha) made of bamboo wrapped in cloth, with a photo of the dead person hung at the center, is navigated through a predefined street by the family along with localities. So a long parade of chariots is seen.\n\nThe Taha-Macha symbolize dead people and is decorated with their possessions and photograph. The chariot has a framework of bamboo which is wrapped with cotton cloth usually Hakupatasi (a black traditional sari type female cloth) for women and simple sari type cloth for men. The Taha-Machas are brought out from different toles of Bhaktapur, but peculiarly, the Taha-Machas of Lakolachhen are guided by one large one that has the bamboo framework but is covered in straws. This is known as Bhailya Dya: (Bhairab) and is succeeded by Ajima (Bhadrakali) made at Khala (Ajima Dyo:Chhen)\n\nMany local musicians, and a cultural dance calledGhinta Ghisi follow in the wake of a chariot. Men are also seen wearing women's dress: Hakupatasi. People dress up funnily. There is face painting and masks are common. Children even dress up as Gods and join the parade.\n\nThe Ghinta Ghisi dance is celebrated for almost a week, starting from the day of Gaijatra to Krishna Janmashtami. The dance is done in a long queen with two persons in a row hitting each other's sticks. Many cultural shows are performed, and the festival is even participated in by many nearby villages.\nAll peoples are faint to this day.\n\n"}

Facing the rear of the B-29, his vantage point made him the first man to witness the cataclysmic growth of the mushroom cloud over Hiroshima.\n\nCaron was also the only photographer aboard, and took photographs as the mushroom cloud ascended. Of the four 509th Composite Group aircraft assigned to the Hiroshima bombing, Caron's camera and two others captured the explosion on film. Immediately before the mission, the 509th's photography officer, Lieutenant Jerome Ossip, asked then Staff Sergeant Caron to carry a handheld Fairchild K-20 camera. After the mission, Ossip developed photos from all the aircraft, but found that the fixed cameras failed to record anything. Film from another handheld was mishandled in developing, making Caron's the only official still photographs of the explosion. 2nd Lt. Russell Gackenback, Navigator aboard then unnamed \"Necessary Evil\", took two still photographs of the cloud about one minute after detonation using his personal AFGA 620 camera. A handheld 16 mm film camera on \"The Great Artiste\" captured the only known motion film of the explosion. Caron's photographs of the explosion were printed on millions of leaflets that were dropped over Japan the next day.\n\nCaron graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School (Brooklyn, New York) in 1938.\n\nIn May 1995, he published the book \"Fire of a Thousand Suns, The George R. \"Bob\" Caron Story, Tail Gunner of the Enola Gay\" about his \"eye-witness account of the momentous event when the world was catapulted into the Atomic Age, the introduction of atomic capability, the technical development of the B-29, and the events that put him into the tail gun turret of the Enola Gay.\"\n\n"}

In the aftermath, strange structures are known colloquially as the Wall Eyes (壁の目 Kabe no Me) appear all over the town of Morioh (杜王町 Moriō-chō), with the ground beneath them having the strange property of swapping traits of whatever two objects are buried there. When a local college student named Yasuho Hirose finds a mysterious youth buried under one of the Wall Eyes, they set off on an adventure together to try to recover his identity. \n\nThe mystery deepens when the corpse of a man called Yoshikage Kira is found buried next to where he was discovered, whose body is missing several parts. Yashuo leaves the youth under the care of her suitor's father, Norisuke Higashikata IV, who takes him in and gives him the name Josuke while she attempts to figure things out from police reports. They also discover that the Higashikata family is related by marriage to the late Yoshikage Kira. Yasuho finds Yoshikage's mother, Holy Joestar-Kira, who stays in a Morioh hospital due to memory loss caused by an incurable disease. Meanwhile, Kyo Nijimura, Holy's daughter who works as a maid for the Higashikata household, reveals to Josuke that he is a composite of Yoshikage's missing body parts with that of another person, having undergone an equivament exchange from being buried under the Wall Eyes. \n\nWhen Josuke later confronts Norisuke about the patriarch's intentions in taking him in, he learns that the Higashikata bloodline is cursed and they need Yoshikage's memories for a cure to prevent them from slowly turning to stone. The core component of this cure is the Rokakaka fruit, which cures people of various ailments when eaten, removes another aspect of themselves in exchange. Jobin Higashikata, the eldest of the family, has been using the family fruit parlour to smuggle these fruits into the country in cooperation with mysterious stone-based beings called Rock Humans. As they research the origin of the fruit further, they meet with several Rock Humans who try to hinder their investigation, while Josuke also discovers the truth of his own existence by meeting Karera Sakunami and later Damo Tamaki, both of whom have ties to his past.\n\nIn a series of flashbacks, Josuke is revealed to be a man called Josefumi Kujo, fused with the parts of Yoshikage Kira that were not present when his corpse was found. Josefumi first met Yoshikage in 1997 when his mother Holy saved the boy's life after he was left to drown. Twelve years later, Yoshikage requests Josefumi's help in stealing a Rokakaka branch from the Rock Humans, and grafting it onto another tree so they can use the fruit to cure Holy of her mysterious disease. The Rock Humans finally enact revenge for this in 2011, with Yoshikage fatally wounded as Josefumi attempts to save his life. But as Josefumi feeds Kira their last Rokakaka Fruit, they are buried alive during the Tōhoku earthquake under the ground on which Wall Eyes emerged: the same area of land where Yasuho later found Josuke.\n\nJosuke resolves to use the Rokakaka fruit to cure Holy's illness, while the Higashikata family wants to harvest it for their own goals. As Josuke starts searching for the grafted branches Josefumi and Yoshikage left behind, he meets Rai Mamezuku, a plant appraiser, while also encountering more Rock Humans who wish to stop him, working on behalf of Jobin. Josuke intentions clash with Jobin's when the Rock Humans' superior Poor Tom gets involved, culminating in the entire Higashikata orchard being set on fire. In the confusion of the fight, Poor Tom is killed by assassins disguised as ambulance drivers, and Rai and Josuke mistakenly believe them to have taken the Rokakaka branch. In reality, Jobin used his son's Stand to mislead them. \n\nBy chance, Yasuho and Jobin's wife Mitsuba happen to be in the hospital where the ambulance went for unrelated illnesses. Yasuho notices Mitsuba in a wheelchair, with her feet turned to stone. She spots the doctor's name on an office sign and uses her Stand to research him, revealing that he is one of the two assailants that killed Poor Tom. Yasuho decides to interrogate Mitsuba about her doctor, Wu Tomoki. However, Mitsuba acts entirely ignorant, revealing that nothing's wrong with her; she doesn't even remember the wheelchair she was on. They suddenly spot two unknown shards on one the empty stools, only for Yasuho to notice that the wheelchair, dismembered and crushed, is hidden in a drawer. As she tries to call Josuke, the two shards appear rubbing against each other on her phone, emit a sound that stuns her as the shards enter her ear. Mitsuba, seemingly under Wu's control, drags her into the office and takes away her phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first volume, Araki described the story of \"JoJolion\" as being the solving of a .

From these, the \"curse\" is lifted, this being the goal of the story.\n\nOn the inside cover of volume 2, Araki explained that the \"...lion\" in the title comes from both the Christian concept of blessing and the gospels (\"evangelion\" in Greek), the Ancient Greek myth of Pygmalion, and lions.\n\nThe first volume of \"JoJolion\" was the second best-selling manga for its debut week of December 19–25, 2011 with 237,374 copies sold.

The name may be derived from the word \"korost\" 'brushwood, bushes, shrubbery'; the form \"Iskorosten\"' sometimes found in early sources is probably based on the common repetition of prepositions in Old East Slavic: \"iz grada iz\"...

The Pope died without Tomarkin being allowed to treat him but reporters subsequently picked up the story and enabled the progress of Tomarkin's medical career with publicising his \"Antimicrobum tomarkin\" medicine, whose active ingredient he named \"Aminoortobenzoilsulfoisoamiloidrocupronucleinforminsodico\". The Antimicrobum was to reduce pneumonia mortality from about one third to 2%. Tomarkin was allowed to treat a cousin of Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, and the cousin recovered. As a result the king named Tomarkin the personal physician of the family. A clinical test at the Santo Spirito hospital in Rome was also successful, later attributed to the better care for test patient and the relatively early stage of pneumonia that the patients were in.\n\nIn May 1924 Tomarkin emigrated to the United States, and three years later founded Tomarkin-Foundation Chemistry Research. At this research centre he developed \"Catalysan\" and \"Disulphamin\", claiming that these medicines bring about mood changes and treat sickness in that way. The Tomarkin Foundation soon spread to Europe. Its dependency in Locarno started to organise conferences between 1930 and 1938. These conferences were set beautifully and had rich side programs and thus attracted prominent people such as surgeon Ferdinand Sauerbruch. In 1931 Albert Einstein assumed the honorary presidency of the conference. Einstein only stayed in that position for one year, after a former landlady of Tomarkin contacted him to help retrieve debts.\n\nAt the onset of World War II Tomarkin again emigrated to the US, due to his Jewish ancestry. With the development of industrially manufactured antibiotics in 1939 his medical invention became obsolete. He ventured into other areas, trying to invent waterproof paint and synthetic diamonds but was unsuccessful with both. Tomarkin died in 1967.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "345728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=345728", "title": "Mary Todd Lincoln", "text": "Mary Todd Lincoln\n\nMary Ann Todd Lincoln (December 13, 1818 – July 16, 1882) was the wife of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, and as such the First Lady of the United States from 1861 to 1865. She dropped the name Ann after her younger sister, Ann Todd (Clark), was born, and did not use the name Todd after marrying.\n\nMary was a member of a large, wealthy Kentucky family, and was well educated. After finishing school during her teens, she moved to Springfield, Illinois, where she lived with her married sister Elizabeth Edwards. Before she married Abraham Lincoln, Mary was courted by his long-time political opponent Stephen A. Douglas. She and Lincoln had four sons together, only one of whom outlived her. Their home of about 17 years still stands at Eighth and Jackson Streets in Springfield, Illinois.\n\nShe supported her husband throughout his presidency. She witnessed his fatal shooting when they were together in the President's Box at Ford's Theatre on Tenth Street in Washington.\n\nMary was briefly involuntarily institutionalized for psychiatric disease ten years after her husband's murder, but later retired to the home of her sister. She also complained of many physical symptoms during her adult life.\n\nMary was born in Lexington, Kentucky as the fourth of seven children of Robert Smith Todd, a banker, and Elizabeth \"Eliza\" (Parker) Todd. Her family were slaveholders, and Mary was raised in comfort and refinement. When Mary was six, her mother died in childbirth. Two years later, her father married Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Humphreys and they had nine children together. Mary had a difficult relationship with her stepmother.\nFrom 1832, Mary and her family lived in what is now known as the Mary Todd Lincoln House, an elegant 14-room residence at 578 West Main Street in Lexington, Kentucky.\n\nMary's paternal great-grandfather, David Levi Todd, was born in County Longford, Ireland, and immigrated through Pennsylvania to Kentucky. Another great-grandfather, Andrew Porter, was the son of an Irish immigrant to New Hampshire and later Pennsylvania. Her great-great maternal grandfather Samuel McDowell was born in Scotland, and emigrated to Pennsylvania. Other Todd ancestors came from England.\n\nAt an early age Mary was sent to Madame Mantelle's finishing school, where the curriculum concentrated on French and literature. She learned to speak French fluently and studied dance, drama, music, and social graces. By age 20, she was regarded as witty and gregarious, with a grasp of politics. Like her family, she was a Whig.\n\nMary began living with her sister Elizabeth Porter Edwards in Springfield, Illinois in October 1839. Elizabeth, married to Ninian W. Edwards, son of a former governor, served as Mary's guardian. Mary was popular among the gentry of Springfield, and though she was courted by the rising young lawyer and Democratic Party politician Stephen A. Douglas and others, she chose Abraham Lincoln, a fellow Whig.\n\nMary Todd married Abraham Lincoln on November 4, 1842, at her sister Elizabeth's home in Springfield, Illinois. She was 23 years old and he was 33 years of age.\n\nTheir four sons, all born in Springfield, were:\n\nRobert and Tad survived to adulthood and the death of their father, and only Robert outlived his mother.\n\nLincoln and Douglas eventually became political rivals in the great Lincoln-Douglas debates for a seat representing Illinois in the United States Senate in 1858. Although Douglas successfully secured the seat when elected by the Illinois legislature, Lincoln became famous for his position on slavery, which generated national support for him.\n\nWhile Lincoln pursued his increasingly successful career as a Springfield lawyer, Mary supervised their growing household. Their house, where they resided from 1844 until 1861, still stands in Springfield, and has been designated the Lincoln Home National Historic Site. During Lincoln's years as an Illinois circuit lawyer, Mary was often left alone for months at a time to raise their children and run the household. Mary supported her husband socially and politically, not least when Lincoln was elected president in 1860.\n\nDuring her White House years, Mary Lincoln faced many personal difficulties generated by political divisions within the nation. Her family was from a border state where slavery was permitted. Several of her half-brothers served in the Confederate Army and were killed in action, and one brother served the Confederacy as a surgeon.\n\nMary staunchly supported her husband in his quest to save the Union and was strictly loyal to his policies. Considered a \"westerner\" although she had grown up in the more refined Upper South city of Lexington, Mary worked hard to serve as her husband's First Lady in Washington, D.C., a political center dominated by eastern culture. Lincoln was regarded as the first \"western\" president, and critics described Mary's manners as coarse and pretentious. She had difficulty negotiating White House social responsibilities and rivalries, spoils-seeking solicitors, and baiting newspapers in a climate of high national intrigue in Civil War Washington. She refurbished the White House, which included extensive redecorating of all the public and private rooms as well as the purchase of new china, which led to extensive overspending. The president was very angry over the cost, even though Congress eventually passed two additional appropriations to cover these expenses.\n\nMary suffered from severe headaches, described as migraines, throughout her adult life, as well as protracted depression. Her headaches seemed to become more frequent after she suffered a head injury in a carriage accident during her White House years. A history of mood swings, fierce temper, public outbursts throughout Lincoln's presidency, as well as excessive spending, has led some historians and psychologists to argue that Mary suffered from bipolar disorder. A physician has also posited that Mary's manic and depressive episodes, as well as many of her physical symptoms, could be explained as manifestations of pernicious anemia.\n\nDuring her White House years, she often visited hospitals around Washington to give flowers and fruit to wounded soldiers. She took the time to write letters for them to send to their loved ones. From time to time, she accompanied Lincoln on military visits to the field. Responsible for hosting many social functions, she has often been blamed by historians for spending too much money on the White House.\n\nAs the Civil War ended, Mrs. Lincoln expected to continue as the First Lady of a nation at peace. President Lincoln awoke the morning of April 14, 1865 in a pleasant mood. Robert E. Lee had surrendered several days before to Ulysses Grant, and now the President was awaiting word from North Carolina on the surrender of Joseph E. Johnston. The morning papers carried the announcement that the President and his wife would be attending the theater that evening. At one point, Mary developed a headache and was inclined to stay home, but Lincoln told her he must attend because newspapers had announced that he would. She sat with her husband watching the comic play \"Our American Cousin\" at Ford's Theatre. During the third act, the President and Mrs. Lincoln drew closer together, holding hands while enjoying the play. Mary whispered to her husband, who was holding her hand, \"What will Miss Harris think of my hanging on to you so?\" The president smiled and replied, \"She won't think anything about it\". That was the last conversation the Lincolns ever had. Minutes later, President Lincoln was shot by John Wilkes Booth. She was holding Abraham's hand when Booth's bullet struck the back of his head. Mrs. Lincoln accompanied her mortally wounded husband across the street to the Petersen House, where he was taken to a back bedroom and laid crosswise on the bed there, where Lincoln's Cabinet was summoned. Their son Robert sat with Lincoln throughout the night and to the following morning – Saturday, April 15, 1865. At one point, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton ordered Mary from the room as she was so unhinged with grief.\n\nPresident Lincoln remained in a coma for approximately nine hours before dying at 7:22 the next morning. Shortly before 7a.m. Mary was allowed to return to Lincoln's side, and, as Dixon reported, \"she again seated herself by the President, kissing him and calling him every endearing name.\" Lincoln died on the morning after the assassination.\n\nAfterward, she received messages of condolence from all over the world, many of which she attempted to answer personally. To Queen Victoria she wrote:\n\nI have received the letter which Your Majesty has had the kindness to write. I am deeply grateful for this expression of tender sympathy, coming as they do, from a heart which from its own sorrow, can appreciate the \"intense grief\" I now endure.Victoria had suffered the loss of her husband, Prince Albert, four years earlier.\n\nAs a widow, Mrs. Lincoln returned to Illinois and lived in Chicago with her sons. In 1868, her former modiste (dressmaker) and confidante, Elizabeth Keckley (1818–1907), published \"Behind the Scenes, or, Thirty Years a Slave, and Four Years in the White House\". She had been born into slavery, purchased her freedom and that of her son, and became a successful businesswoman in Washington, D.C. Although this book provides valuable insight into the character and life of Mary Todd Lincoln, at the time the former First Lady (and much of the public and press) regarded it as a breach of friendship and confidentiality. Keckley was widely criticized for her book, especially as her editor had published letters from Mary Lincoln to her. It has now been gratefully accepted by many historians and biographers and been used to flesh out the President and First Lady's personalities behind the scenes in the Executive Mansion and been used as the basis for several motion pictures and TV mini-series during the late 20th and early 21st Centuries.\n\nIn an act approved by a low margin on July 14, 1870, the United States Congress granted Mrs. Lincoln a life pension of $3,000 a year ($ in dollars). Mary had lobbied hard for such a pension, writing numerous letters to Congress and urging patrons such as Simon Cameron to petition on her behalf. She insisted that she deserved a pension just as much as the widows of soldiers, as she portrayed her husband as a fallen commander. At the time it was unprecedented for widows of presidents, and Mary Lincoln had alienated many congressmen, making it difficult for her to gain approval.\n\nThe death of her son Thomas (Tad) in July 1871, following the death of two of her other sons and her husband, brought on an overpowering grief and depression. Her surviving son, Robert Lincoln, a rising young Chicago lawyer, was alarmed at his mother's increasingly erratic behavior. In March 1875, during a visit to Jacksonville, Florida, Mary became unshakably convinced that Robert was deathly ill; hurrying to Chicago, she found him healthy. During her visit with him, she told him that someone had tried to poison her on the train and that a \"wandering Jew\" had taken her pocketbook but returned it later. She also spent large amounts of money there on items she never used, such as draperies and elaborate dresses (she wore only black after her husband's assassination). She walked around the city with $56,000 in government bonds sewn into her petticoats (underskirts). Despite this large amount of money and the $3,000-a-year stipend from Congress, Mrs. Lincoln had an irrational fear of poverty. In 1872, she went to spiritualist photographer, William H. Mumler, who produced a photograph of her that appears to faintly show the ghost of President Lincoln behind her (photo in Allen County Public Library, Fort Wayne, Indiana).\n\nDue to her erratic behavior, Robert initiated proceedings to have her institutionalized. On May 20, 1875, following a trial, a jury committed her to a private asylum in Batavia, Illinois. After the court proceedings, she was so despondent that she attempted suicide. She went to several pharmacies and ordered enough laudanum to kill herself, but an alert pharmacist frustrated her attempts and finally gave her a placebo.\n\nThree months after being committed to Bellevue Place, she devised her escape: She smuggled letters to her lawyer, James B. Bradwell, and his wife Myra Bradwell, who was not only her friend but also a feminist lawyer. She also wrote to the editor of the \"Chicago Times\". Soon, the public embarrassments that Robert had hoped to avoid were looming, and his character and motives were in question, as he controlled his mother's finances. The director of Bellevue at Mary's trial had assured the jury she would benefit from treatment at his facility. In the face of potentially damaging publicity, he declared her well enough to go to Springfield to live with her sister Elizabeth as she desired.\n\nMary Lincoln was released into the custody of her sister in Springfield. In 1876 she was declared competent to manage her own affairs. The earlier committal proceedings had resulted in Mary being profoundly estranged from her son Robert, and they did not see each other again until shortly before her death.\n\nMrs. Lincoln spent the next four years traveling throughout Europe and took up residence in Pau, France. Her final years were marked by declining health. She suffered from severe cataracts that reduced her eyesight; this condition may have contributed to her increasing susceptibility to falls. In 1879, she suffered spinal cord injuries in a fall from a stepladder. She traveled to New York in 1881 and lobbied for an increased pension after the assassination of President Garfield raised the issue of provisions for his family. She faced a difficult battle, due to negative press over her spending habits and rumors about her handling of her personal finances, including $56,000 in government bonds left to her by her husband. Congress eventually granted the increase, along with an additional monetary gift. Shortly afterwards, she returned to Springfield and her health deteriorated until she died a few months later.\n\nDuring the early 1880s, Mary Lincoln was confined to the Springfield, Illinois residence of her sister Elizabeth Edwards. On July 15, 1882, exactly eleven years after her youngest son died, she became unconscious and died the next morning of a stroke.\n\nBiographies have been written about Mary Lincoln as well as her husband. Barbara Hambly's \"The Emancipator's Wife\" (2005) is considered a well-researched historical novel that provides context for her use of over-the-counter drugs containing alcohol and opium, which were frequently given to women of her era. Janis Cooke Newman's historical novel \"Mary: Mrs. A. Lincoln\" (2007), in which Mary tells her own story after incarceration in the asylum in an effort to maintain and prove her sanity, is considered by Mary's recent biographer, Jean H. Baker, to be 'close to life' in its depiction of Mary Lincoln's life. The grief experienced through her widowhood is a theme of Andrew Holleran's 2006 novel, \"Grief\".\n\nMary Lincoln has been portrayed by several actresses in film, including Ruth Gordon in \"Abe Lincoln in Illinois\" (1940); Julie Harris in \"The Last of Mrs. Lincoln\", a 1976 television adaptation of the stage play; Mary Tyler Moore in the 1988 television mini-series \"Lincoln\"; Sally Field in Steven Spielberg's 2012 film \"Lincoln\"; Penelope Ann Miller in \"Saving Lincoln\" (2012); and Mary Elizabeth Winstead in \"\" (2012), set during the Civil War. Mezzo-soprano Elaine Bonazzi portrayed Mary in Thomas Pasatieri's Emmy Award winning opera \"The Trial of Mary Lincoln\" in 1972.\n\nIn 1955, Vivi Janiss played the historical Mary Todd Lincoln in \"How Chance Made Lincoln President\" in the anthology television series, \"TV Reader's Digest\". Richard Gaines was cast as Abraham Lincoln, and Ken Hardison played their son, Robert Todd Lincoln.\n\nIn 2005, Sufjan Stevens referenced Mary Todd Lincoln in the instrumental track \"A Short Reprise for Mary Todd, Who Went Insane, but for Very Good Reasons\" from his album Illinois, which is themed around the state where she resided the majority of her life.\n\nHer sister Elizabeth Todd married Ninian Edwards Jr., the son of the Illinois Governor Ninian Edwards. Their daughter Julia Edwards married Edward L. Baker, editor of the \"Illinois State Journal\" and son of Congressman David Jewett Baker. Their daughter, Mary Todd Lincoln's grandniece Mary Edwards Brown, served as custodian of the Lincoln Homestead, as did her own daughter. Mary's half-sister Emilie Todd married Benjamin Hardin Helm, CSA general and son of the Kentucky Governor John L. Helm. Another half-sister Elodie Todd married CSA Brig. General Nathaniel H. R. Dawson, later the third U.S. Commissioner of Education. One of Mary Todd's cousins was Kentucky Congressman/US General John Blair Smith Todd.\n\n\n\n"}

It is committed by someone who knows a treason is being or is about to be committed but does not report it to a proper authority.\n\nUnder Australian law a person is guilty of misprision of treason if he:\n\nThe penalty is life imprisonment.\n\nUnder section 50(1)(b) of the Canadian \"Criminal Code\", a person is guilty of an offence (although it is not described as misprision) if: \"knowing that a person is about to commit high treason or treason [he] does not, with all reasonable dispatch, inform a justice of the peace or other peace officer thereof or make other reasonable efforts to prevent that person from committing high treason or treason.\"\n\nThe maximum penalty is 14 years.\n\nUnder section 3 of the Treason Act 1939 a person is guilty of misprision of treason if \"knowing that any act the commission of which would be treason is intended or proposed to be, or is being, or has been committed, [he] does not forthwith disclose the same, together with all particulars thereof known to him, to a Justice of the District Court, or an officer of the Gárda Síochána, or some other person lawfully engaged on duties relating to the preservation of peace and order.\"\n\nSection 76(b) of the Crimes Act 1961 provides that any person who \"knowing that a person is about to commit treason, fails without reasonable excuse to inform a constable as soon as possible or to use other reasonable efforts to prevent its commission\" is guilty of an offence.\n\nA person guilty of this offence is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding seven years.\n\nRussia has no specific offence of misprision. However Article 275 of the Criminal Code of Russia encourages people to come forward with information by providing them with a statutory defence to treason and other offences:\n\nMisprision of treason is an offence under the common law of England and Wales and the common law of Northern Ireland. By statute, the offence of misprision of treason under the common law of England has been made an offence which is cognisable under the law of Scotland. This offence was formerly known as misprision of high treason in order to distinguish it from misprision of petty treason, before that offence was abolished along with its parent offence in 1828.\n\nThe crime is committed where a person knows that treason is being planned or committed and does not report it as soon as he can to a justice of the peace or other authority. The offender does not need to consent to the treason; mere knowledge is enough. Concealment of treason was itself a treason at common law until the Treason Act 1554 deemed it merely misprision of treason, which was a felony.\n\nIn R v. Tonge (1662) 6 State Tr 225, it was said that:\n\nSimilarly, in R v. Walcott (1683) 9 State Tr 519 at 553, Pemberton, LCJ. said:\n\nIt is punishable by imprisonment for life.\n\nThe procedure on trials for misprision of treason is the same as that on trials for murder. It is classified as an indictable-only offence.\n\nA person may not be indicted for misprision of treason committed within the United Kingdom unless the indictment is signed within three years of the commission of that offence.\n\nMisprision of treason is a reserved matter on which the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate.\n\nIn the United States, misprision of treason is a federal offense, committed where someone who has knowledge of the commission of any treason against the United States, conceals such knowledge and does not inform the President, a federal judge, a State Governor, or a State judge (\"\"). It is punishable by a fine and up to seven years in federal prison. It is also a crime punishable under the criminal laws of many states.\n\n\n"}

The group typically targets organizations in East Asia. These organizations include, but are not limited to, media outlets, high-tech companies, and governments. Numbered Panda is believed to have been operating since 2009. However, the group is also credited with a 2012 data breach at the New York Times. One of the group’s typical techniques is to send PDF files loaded with malware via spear phishing campaigns. The decoy documents are typically written in traditional Chinese, which is widely used in Taiwan, and the targets are largely associated with Taiwanese interests. Numbered Panda appears to be actively seeking out cybersecurity research relating to the malware they use. After an Arbor Networks report on the group, FireEye noticed a change in the group’s techniques to avoid future detection.\n\nTrend Micro first reported on Numbered Panda in a 2012 white paper. Researchers discovered that the group launched spear phishing campaigns, using the Ixeshe malware, primarily against East Asian nations since approximately 2009. CrowdStrike further discussed the group in the 2013 blog post \"Whois Numbered Panda\". This post followed the 2012 attack on the New York Times and its subsequent 2013 reporting on the attack. In June 2014, Arbor Networks released a report detailing Numbered Panda's use of Etumbot to target Taiwan and Japan. In September 2014, FireEye released a report highlighting the group's evolution. FireEye linked the release of Arbor Networks report to Numbered Panda's change in tactics.\n\nTrend Micro reported on a campaign against East Asian governments, electronics manufacturers, and a telecommunications company. Numbered Panda engaged in spear phishing email campaigns with malicious attachments. Often, the malicious email attachments would be PDF files that exploited CVE-2009-4324, CVE-2009-09274, CVE-2011-06095, or CVE-2011-0611 vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, and Flash Player. The attackers also used an exploit that affected Microsoft Excel - CVE-2009-3129. The Ixeshe malware used in this campaign allowed Numbered Panda to list all services, processes, and drives; terminate processes and services; download and upload files; start processes and services; get victims’ user names; get a machine’s name and domain name; download and execute arbitrary files; cause a system to pause or sleep for a specified number of minutes; spawn a remote shell; and list all current files and directories. After installation, Ixeshe would start communicating with command-and-control servers; oftentimes three servers were hard-coded for redundancy. Numbered Panda often used compromised servers to create these command-and-control servers to increase control of a victim’s network infrastructure. Using this technique, the group is believed to have amassed sixty servers by 2012. A majority of the command-and-control servers used from this campaign were located in Taiwan and the United States. Base64 was used for communication between the compromised computer and the server. Trend Micro found that, once decoded, the communication was a standardized structure that detailed the computer's name, local IP address, proxy server IP and port, and the malware ID. Researchers at CrowdStrike found that blogs and WordPress sites were frequently used in the command-and-control infrastructure to make the network traffic look more legitimate.\n\nAn Arbor Security report found that Numbered Panda began a campaign against Japan and Taiwan using the Etumbot malware in 2011. Similar to the previously observed campaign, the attackers would use decoy files, such as PDF, Excel spreadsheets, or Word documents, as email attachments to gain access to victims' computers. Most of the documents observed were written in Traditional Chinese and usually pertained to Taiwanese government interests; several of the files related to upcoming conferences in Taiwan. Once the malicious file was downloaded and extracted by the victim, Etumbot uses a right-to-left override exploit to trick the victim to download the malware installer. According to Arbor Security, the \"technique is a simple way for malware writers to disguise names of malicious files. A hidden Unicode character in the filename will reverse the order of the characters that follow it, so that a .scr binary file appears to be a .xls document, for example.\" Once the malware is installed, it sends a request to a command-and-control server with a RC4 key to encrypt subsequent communication. As was with the Ixeshe malware, Numbered Panda used Base64 encoded characters to communicate from compromised computers to the command-and-control servers. Etumbot is able to determine if the target computer is using a proxy and will bypass the proxy settings to directly establish a connection. After communication is established, the malware will send an encrypted message from the infected computer to the server with the NetBIOS name of the victim's system, user name, IP address, and if the system is using a proxy.\n\nAfter the May 2014 Arbor Security report detailed Etumbot, FireEye discovered that Numbered Panda changed parts of the malware. FireEye noticed that the protocols and strings previously used were changed in June 2014. The researchers at FireEye believe this change was to help the malware evade further detection. FireEye named this new version of Etumbot HighTide. Numbered Panda continued to target Taiwan with spear phishing email campaigns with malicious attachments. Attached Microsoft Word documents exploited the CVE-2012-0158 vulnerability to help propagate HighTide. FireEye found that compromised Taiwanese government employee email accounts were used in some of the spear phishing. HighTide differs from Etumbot in that its HTTP GET request changed the User Agent, the format and structure of the HTTP Uniform Resource Identifier, the executable file location, and the image base address.\n\nNumbered Panda is believed to be responsible for the computer network breach at the New York Times in late 2012. The attack occurred after the New York Times published a story about how the relatives of Wen Jiabao, the sixth Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, \"accumulated a fortune worth several billion dollars through business dealings.\" The computers used to launch the attack are believed to be the same university computers used by the Chinese military to attack United States military contractors. Numbered Panda used updated versions of the malware packages Aumlib and Ixeshe. The updated Aumlib allowed Numbered Panda to encode the body of a POST request to gather a victim's BIOS, external IP, and operating system. A new version of Ixeshe altered the pervious version's network traffic pattern in an effort to evade existing network traffic signatures designed to detect Ixeshe related infections.\n"}
{"id": "2641313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2641313", "title": "Orleans Levee Board", "text": "Orleans Levee Board\n\nFrom 1890 through 2006, the Orleans Levee Board was the body of commissioners that oversaw the Orleans Levee District (OLD) which supervised the levee and floodwall system in Orleans Parish, Louisiana. The role of the OLD has changed over time. Prior to Hurricane Betsy in 1965, the OLD developed land and sold it to raise money to build and improve levees. After 1965, Congress directed the Army Corps of Engineers to be responsible for design and construction of the hurricane flood protection system enveloping New Orleans.\n\nOwing to the 1965 legislation, the OLB's duties regarding hurricane surge protection were now limited to collecting the 30% cost share for project design and construction, and to maintaining and operating completed flood protection structures. Until the end of 2006, the OLB was a major governmental entity which functioned independently of municipal government in and around Orleans Parish. (Orleans Parish is coextensive with the city of New Orleans; their boundaries are one and the same).\n\nIn the wake of the catastrophic levee failures in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina, two new regional flood protection authorities were created to replace the multiple parochial levee boards, including Orleans Parish's Levee Board. Most of the Orleans Levee District now falls under the jurisdiction of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - East, charged with the oversight of all flood-protection infrastructure for Greater New Orleans on the East Bank of the Mississippi River. The Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority - West possesses the same metro-wide jurisdiction for the West Bank of the Mississippi, and it includes that portion of the Orleans Levee District on the West Bank (i.e., Algiers).\n\nAfter Hurricana Katrina, it was widely believed that perhaps a different form of levee board governance might be more appropriate for a major marine terminal like New Orleans. Nevertheless, the issue of whether the members of the OLB Engineering Committee acted incompetently or negligently has not been conclusively demonstrated or proven.\n\nThe pre-Katrina Orleans Levee District (OLD), governed by the Orleans Levee Board (OLB), owned considerable assets, mainly real estate, a peculiarity that stems from its history. The Orleans Levee District was created by the Louisiana legislature in 1890 for the purpose of protecting the low-lying city of New Orleans from floods. At that time, communities along the Mississippi River were largely in charge of creating their own levees to protect themselves, as no unified levee system existed. Most neighboring parishes had (and some still have) similar parochial levee boards. In the early twentieth century, the OLD reclaimed a portion of Lake Pontchartrain, a 24-mile wide lake north of New Orleans. The OLD developed the land and sold it to raise money to build and improve levees. Starting in the 1920s, the Board undertook a massive flood-protection initiative involving the construction of a stepped seawall several hundred feet north of a portion of the existing south shore of Lake Pontchartrain. The intervening area was filled to several feet above sea level and was to serve as a \"super levee\" protecting the city from the Lake's storm surge.\n\nThe Lake Vista, Lake Oaks, Lake Terrace, East and West Lakeshore subdivisions and other property between Robert E. Lee Blvd and Lake Pontchartrain are all examples of the OLB's developed properties.\n\nIn 1924, the state legislature authorized the OLB to acquire 33,000 acres (130 km²) of land on the east bank of the Mississippi River about south of New Orleans in order to build the Bohemia Spillway between the River and the Gulf of Mexico. (\"1924 La. Acts 99\"). Approximately half of this land was public property transferred from the state; the other half was either expropriated,\nor purchased under threat of expropriation, from private owners according to a legal finding. (\"1928 La. Acts 246; 1942 La. Acts 311\").\n\nIn the aftermath of the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the U.S. Congress gave the United States Army Corps of Engineers supervision and control over the design and construction of flood-control infrastructure throughout the Mississippi River Valley.\n\nIn 1934, New Orleans Lakefront Airport opened on land dredged from Lake Pontchartrain by the Levee Board, part of a larger \"lakefill\" land-reclamation project initiated to construct a super levee for the protection of the northern perimeter of the city. The airport was originally named \"Shushan Airport\" after Orleans Levee Board president Abraham Lazar Shushan; it was renamed \"New Orleans Airport\" after Shushan's indictment for corruption in the Louisiana Scandals of the late 1930s.\n\nGovernor Jimmie Davis, in his second term from 1960 to 1964, named the New Orleans attorney Gerald J. Gallinghouse as the president of the levee board. In that capacity, Gallinghouse delivered more than 300 speeches warning of the need to be prepared for weather disasters, another of which was on its way, Hurricane Betsy.\nAfter extensive flooding during Hurricane Betsy in 1965, Congress ordered the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers henceforth to design and build flood protection in the \"Lake Pontchartrain and Vicinity Hurricane Protection Project\". The OLB became the local sponsor, and its duties regarding flood protection were now limited to collecting 30% cost-share for project design and construction and maintaining the completed structures. Despite Congress's mandate that the Corps now had the authority to design/build flood protection, the OLB still retained extensive assets which had to be managed.\n\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, in a context of shock, chaos and confusion, the Orleans Levee Board found itself at the center of the greatest crisis ever to face the city of New Orleans. Multiple levee and floodwall breaches in the Industrial Canal, the 17th Street Canal, and the London Avenue Canal resulted in the flooding of 80% of the city. The flood is believed to have directly caused over 1,400 deaths; destroyed or severely damaged homes, businesses, and property in the majority of the city.\n\nInvestigations after the disaster revealed that the design of the levee and floodwall system, designed and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, had profoundly inadequate design and construction specifications.\n\nWhat is evident from the project record is that the Army Corps recommended raising the canal floodwalls for the 17th Street Canal, but recommended gated structures at the mouths of the Orleans and London Avenue Canals because the latter plan was less expensive. The OLB convinced Congress to pass legislation that required the Corps to raise the floodwalls for all three canals. Furthermore, the Corps, in a separate attempt to limit project costs, initiated a sheet pile load test (E-99 Study), but misinterpreted the results and wrongly concluded that sheet piles needed to be driven to depths of only 17 feet (1 foot ¼ 0.3048 meters) instead of between 31 and 46 feet. That decision saved approximately $100 million, but significantly reduced overall engineering reliability.\n\nAfter the levee failures, the immediate assumption was that the OLD commissioners were not engaged in flood protection. This was reinforced by corps spokespersons who repeatedly told a story of local levee board officials who \"forced\" the corps to build the system that failed. As revealed in an August 2015 article in the official journal of the World Water Council, the story is untrue, and responsibility for the levee failures belongs to the corps. Nonetheless, in the context of haste confusion, there were calls for the elimination of the Orleans Levee Board and other local boards.\n\nDuring a special session of the Louisiana Legislature, a bill submitted by Sen. Walter Boasso (D-Arabi) was passed into law, which consolidated the levee boards of various parishes within Greater New Orleans. The new legislation was intended to (1) remove distractions, (2) replace parochial flood control with regional flood control, and (3) require commissioners to have professional expertise including hydrology, construction engineering and civil engineering.\n\nThe law created two new regional levee boards, Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-East and Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority-West, separated by the Mississippi River. The Orleans Levee Board ceased to exist on January 1, 2007. The new regional flood-protection authorities assumed control of the Board's flood-protection infrastructure. Lakefront Airport, the marinas (except for the city-owned Municipal Yacht Harbor), Lakeshore Drive, and the lakefront park system (except for West End Park, administered by New Orleans' Parks and Parkways Department) are now operated and maintained by the Louisiana State Division of Administration Non-Flood Protection Asset Management Authority.\n\nInvestigative studies completed after the legislation's passage revealed no causal link between the pre-Katrina levee boards and the flooding. Nonetheless, the new levee boards are very useful. To the extent legally possible and within budget, the East and West Levee Authorities are checking the corps' general plans. They are well focused, have relevant expertise and may catch egregious planning and/or design errors.\"\n\nThe levee breach event was a pivotal moment in American history. The nation took a different path due to the flooding event. The myriad changes to national policy as a result of this lynchpin moment include, but are not limited to, the following: Nationwide assessment of levees, First-ever National Levee Safety Act, National Flood Risk Management Program, Reform of the Army Corps of Engineers and Changes in Levee Building by the Corps.\n\nSince fifty-five percent of American people lives in counties protected by levees, this means the majority of the national population are safer.\n\n\n"}

Thomson Reuters described rebels as \"ramping up attacks on Damascus\" in late November and \"BBC News\" described the 29 November government counterattack as \"an unprecedented offensive against rebel-held districts in the east of the city\".\n\nIn September 2012 during the Syrian civil war, rebels carried out bomb attacks against military institutions in Damascus, killing 40 to 60 people, including high-ranking government officials, while the Syrian Army killed 40 cilivians near Damascus and 16 in Damascus itself. In October, rebels attacked governmental sites in Damascus, captured an air force base and shot down a military helicopter in the eastern Damascus suburbs. Clashes continued throughout October, with deaths of rebels, government forces and civilians. Rebels captured two Syrian Army checkpoints in the Damascus suburb of Harasta and on 25 and 26 October, the Syrian Army attacked Harasta with tank shells and rockets.\n\nOn 31 October, the Free Syrian Army announced that they had helped to form a brigade made up of anti-Assad Palestinians, (Storm Brigade), which was armed to take control of Yarmouk camp from the pro-Assad Palestinian group, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The PFLP-GC leader Ahmed Jibril and his men have been accused of harassing the camp's residents and attacking FSA fighters. Many Palestinian men from the camp also joined other FSA units and fought with them in the Damascus districts of Tadamon and Al-Hajar Al-Aswad.\n\nIn the week following the 30 October rebel assassination of high-ranking Syrian Air Force General Abdullah Mahmoud al-Khalidi, rebel fighters engaged in more assassinations of high-profile government figures. On 6 November, rebel gunmen killed Mohammed Osama Laham, the brother of the Syrian Parliament Speaker, as he drove to work.\n\nOn 7 November, rebels launched a large operation in Central Damascus. Firing mortars into the predominantly Alawite Mezzah 86 district near the Presidential Palace, rebel forces hit the Prime Minister's offices and Mezzah's military airport, killing 3 civilians and injuring 12 others. A spokesperson for the Revolutionary Council in Damascus, Susan Ahmed, described the operation as \"a countdown\", and also stated \"It seems something serious is going on there now and things are going out of control. The regime cannot control Damascus anymore\". On the same day, a Syrian judge was assassinated in a residential area of Damascus when explosives planted under his car were remotely detonated.\n\nOn 12 November, fierce clashes occurred between rebel and government forces in the East Damascus suburb of Ghuta, resulting in the death of 10 soldiers and 1 rebel.\n\nOn 17 November, a military helicopter was shot down in the suburbs of Damascus.\n\nThomson Reuters described rebels as \"ramping up attacks on Damascus\" in late November. On 19 November, rebels seized the headquarters of an army battalion near the district of Hajar al-Aswad and the southern gate of Damascus, making it the nearest military base to Central Damascus to fall under rebel control. On 25 November, rebels seized control of the Marj al-Sultan military airbase in Eastern Ghouta after a battle in which two Syrian Army helicopters were shot down.\n\nOn 28 November, rebel forces started attacking the Damascus International Airport in a strategic attempt to seize important targets; taking control of the airport would weaken the government's air offensive. On 29 November, rebels stated that they had blocked access to the airport. The Ministry of Information said that access to the airport was safe and clear of rebel activity. Emirates and EgyptAir suspended their flights to Damascus. \"BBC News\" described the 29 November government fighting as \"an unprecedented offensive against rebel-held districts in the east of the city\". The main Internet gateways to/from Syria were cut off at around 12:00 to 13:00 (local time).\n\nOn 1 December, clashes occurred in Arbin (east of Damascus) and government forces shelled Zabadani, leaving many people wounded, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). Government forces tried to secure the airport highway by fighting in Mliha, as part of a strategy to \"secure a wider perimeter around Damascus\" to prevent rebels from entering Damascus. Agence France-Presse suggested that the military's aim was to make negotiations with the rebels easier.\n\nIntense fighting between rebels and government forces and bombardment by government forces continued to 2 December in and around the highway to the airport. EgyptAir announced on 2 December that it would reopen flights to the airport on 3 December. On 2 December, the Syrian army bombarded rebel-held suburbs around Damascus with fighter aircraft and rockets, killing at least ten rebels and wounding dozens in an offensive to stop rebels closing in on Damascus. The Syrian army entered part of Daraya where rebels had launched mortars into the city. The Army had entered one side of the town, but rebels were still in control of the rest of the area and were fighting back.\n\nOn 3 December, the Syrian Army continued firing artillery and using fighter jets against the rebel-held areas near Damascus in order to protect the capital.\n\nOn 4 December, Syrian state television claimed that 29 students and a teacher were killed by a \"terrorist\" mortar attack in the suburbs of Damascus.\n\nOn 5 December, fighting took place near Aqraba military airport (near Damascus International Airport), with the Free Syrian Army claiming to \"secure control\" of the military airport itself, according to \"Al Arabiya\" and \"NOW Lebanon\". According to \"NOW Lebanon\", rebels also took over the Eastern Ghouta airbase for a second time since the first takeover on 25 November.\n\nOn 7 December, the rebels claimed that they were still blockading most access to the Damascus International Airport. Damascus Military Council spokesperson Nabil al-Amir stated that the rebels had \"waited two weeks for the airport to be emptied of most civilians and airlines\" and that as of 7 December, the airport was \"a military zone\" and that \"civilians who approach it now do so at their own risk.\" Flights by foreign airlines to the airport remained suspended. A governmental spokesperson stated that the Syrian Army was \"driving rebels back from positions in the suburbs and outskirts of Damascus\". On 8 December, the airport road was blocked at one point.\n\nBy 9 December, the military counteroffensive was seen as successful in relieving the rebel pressure on the capital. Patrick Cockburn writing in \"The Independent\" stated that the Syrian Army had strengthened its control of Damascus by shifting forces from the Syrian countryside to Damascus. A diplomat contacted by Cockburn stated, \"In private, FSA commanders admitted that their attacks in Damascus had not gone as planned and they suffered losses, but this does not mean that they will not try again.\" Witnesses reported seeing bodies of dead rebels and soldiers lying beside the airport road. A rebel fighter interviewed by \"The New York Times\" said that the attack on the airport was a diversion to allow fighters, who were attempting to seize control of the road from Damascus to the northeast, to escape after suffering heavy casualties, due to poor planning. According to him, the resulting Syrian Army counter-offensive resulted in an \"unbelievable\" level of violence.\n\nOn December 15, a rebel spokesperson for the Ababil Horan and Eastern Ghouta Brigades claimed that the FSA attacked a meeting in Damascus that led to the killing of \"a number of the heads of operations\" in Damascus and its suburbs, and that they now have knowledge of movements and meetings of other senior heads of operations in Damascus.\n\nOn 16 December, Syrian Army jets bombed the Palestinian refugee Yarmouk Camp, for the first time since the uprising began in March 2011. Activists reported at least two rockets fired and dozens killed as a mosque sheltering refugees from embattled areas of the capital was hit.\n\nOn 17 December, rebels claimed that many PFLP-GC fighters who were fighting in the camp defected to the rebels, while their leader, Ahmad Jibril, and the remaining fighters joined government troops outside the camp. Later that day, rebel forces gained full control of the Yarmouk camp and another Palestinian camp with assistance from anti-Assad Palestinian factions, pushing PFLP-GC fighters out. Government forces had surrounded the camp, however, as many refugees fled.\n\nOn 19 December, fresh fighting on the outskirts of Yarmouk killed a civilian and 4 PFLP-GC members.\n\nOn 24 December, rebel fighters ambushed and killed a Military Intelligence Chief in the predominantly Christian and Druze district of Jaramana, southeast of Damascus.\n\nOn 31 December, government forces intensified shelling of the rebel stronghold of Daraya. The military amassed a large convoy on the outskirts of the town in preparation to storm the suburb. Rebel fighters said that an armoured column was trying to advance into Daraya, but was being held back by resistance from the Free Syrian Army.\n\nOn 2 January, up to 70 people were killed in the Damascus suburb of Mleiha after Syrian Army airstrikes hit a petrol station.\n\nOn 4 January, Syrian ground and air forces bombarded rebel strongholds on the outskirts of Damascus, as part of the government's continuing offensive. Rebel forces were fighting the government in areas on three sides of the capital. However, the opposition's advance bogged down due to continuing airstrikes. A group of international journalists covering the army's operations outside the capital was caught in the crossfire, and a RT correspondent was wounded.\n\nOn 12 January, a government official and the director of SOHR both confirmed government troops had entered most of Daraya and that there was still heavy fighting in the town.\n\nOn 19 January, it was reported that the rebels were still in control of Daraya in spite of fierce clashes and heavy shelling by government forces. Rebels also claimed that a MiG pilot in Daraya had defected and used his fighter jet to bombard three Army positions in the area, killing 15 soldiers of the 4th Syrian Army Brigade; this was not independently confirmed.\n\nOn 24 January, the government was shelling Daraya from positions on the Qasioun mountain range west of Damascus.\n\nOn 26 January, Asharq al-Awsat reported that rebel forces fighting in Damascus suburbs had fired at the presidential palace in northwest Damascus and toward an army airport, although this wasn't confirmed by other sources.\n\nOn 27 January, it was reported that the Free Syrian Army had taken control of a Syrian Army communications base near Damascus International Airport. Rebels also clashed with the Syrian Army at a railway station in the southwestern Damascus district of Qadam.\n\nOn January 30, the Israeli Air Force bombed a convoy in the Jimraya district northwest of Damascus which was alleged to be carrying anti-aircraft weapons bound for Hezbollah, according to American officials and regional security sources. The Syrian government claimed that a research facility was struck, not a convoy, and that two people were killed. Three days later, American officials said that the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which was damaged in the strike, was the Syrian government's primary research laboratory for chemical and biological weapons.\n\nOn 6 February, rebel forces launched an offensive, named \"Battle of Armageddon\", on the edge of Central Damascus, with rebels entering the Jobar District of Damascus after overrunning a Syrian Army road block. Parts of the Damascus ring road, which acts as a barrier between Central Damascus and Ghouta, were also seized by rebel fighters. Rebels also launced attacks on Adra, north east of Damascus.\n\nOn 10 February, a rebel claimed that opposition forces had captured another military checkpoint in the Jobar district. However, SOHR stated that while fighting for the highway continued, government troops regained control of the area after bombing rebel positions the day before.\n\nOn 20 February, a SCUD missile fired by government forces hit the Douma command center of the Liwa al-Islam Brigade, which had been spearheading the attack against the roundabout and the Jobar district. Sheikh Zahran Alloush, the commander and founder of the brigade, had been wounded in the strike. The area was devastated and other rebel fighters were also killed or wounded.\n\nOn 27 February, SOHR claimed that rebels had fired several mortar shells which exploded in the military judiciary and literature department of the University of Damascus.\n\nHolding Damascus was considered crucial for the government, which kept its highest concentration of troops and its most loyal and best-trained units in and around the city. According to \"The New York Times\", rebels were unlikely to be able to overrun Damascus quickly, but the fighting in Rif Dimashq, especially at the airport, had a profound psychological effect on government supporters, making them feel trapped, and forcing the Syrian Army to shift resources from other areas to defend Damascus.\n\nDamascus residents described an atmosphere of tension and fear. Government checkpoints were also so numerous that it was difficult to travel anywhere without passing through one. Emile Hokayem of the International Institute for Strategic Studies described the fighting as \"part of the strategy of encirclement of the city. The rebels are making a very strong point: that they can go after anything that is seen as critical infrastructure.\" He expected that the government would be able to reopen the airport and the airport road, but that \"the cost of doing so [would] increase over time.\"\n\nDaraya bore the brunt of the Army's offensive due to its proximity to the Presidential complex, which the rebels' rockets missed.\n\nIn early January 2013, reports emerged that the military had prior knowledge of the rebel offensive. Based on the information, the Army withdrew on purpose from less strategically significant positions in favor of massing troops to defend Damascus and thus luring rebel forces farther from their supply bases. Due to the Army's retreat and false information leaked to the media on the state of the military, the rebels attacked even before their official start date for the offensive. Once the rebels advanced beyond their supply chains and started attacking the outskirts of the capital, the military used concentrated artillery and air attacks to hit them and inflict the greatest amount of casualties. One of the rebel groups reportedly suffering heavily was the Al-Nusra Front.\n"}

{"id": "5060914", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5060914", "title": "Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest", "text": "Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest\n\nThe official rules of the Eurovision Song Contest are long, technical, and ever-changing. Many of the rules cover technical aspects of the television broadcast itself. However, a few of the more important rules affecting the conduct and outcome of the Contest follow.\n\nEach country in the Eurovision Song Contest is entitled to enter just one song. The contest final is limited to 26 songs, apart from in 2015 when 27 countries took part following what was initially meant to be a one-off invite to Australia. Since 2016, Australia have competed in the semi-finals. They consist of the following:\n\n\nAt the first Contest, each country was allowed to submit two songs each with a maximum duration of three minutes. Nowadays, it is still required that each song not exceed three minutes in length, although many artists record the song in a longer version, simply performing a shorter version at the Contest. The number of participating countries has grown throughout the Contest's history, and since 1993 the rules have been changed several times to both limit the number of finalists and to allow for participation by former Soviet and Yugoslav republics, Warsaw Pact nations and others.\n\nThe entering song is also not allowed to be a cover version, and is not allowed to sample another artist's work. All songs must be completely original in terms of songwriting and instrumentation, and may not have been released publicly before 1 September of the year preceding. If released publicly, it may only be released in the entrant country's market until after the contest.\n\nArtists shall perform live on stage, accompanied by a recorded backing-track which contains no vocals of any kind or any vocal imitations aiming at replacing or assisting the live/original voice of the Contestant(s). The Host Broadcaster shall verify respect for this rule.\n\nNo entirely instrumental composition has ever been allowed in Eurovision contests. Norway won the Eurovision Song Contest in 1995 with a song focused on its instrumentals, but was eligible for participation because some lyrics (22 words in total) were added. Latvia performed their act a cappella in 2006, as did Belgium in 2011. Norway's entry in the 2010 Contest, and Austria's 2011 in the contest started a cappella but then the instruments started as well. This rule also played a vital role in Moldova's entry in 2010, as SunStroke Project's Epic Sax Guy became a worldwide internet phenomenon. The group's saxophonist, Sergey Stepanov, had to synchronize his movements with a pre-recorded track that was played during the live performance. Live music has been banned in Eurovision performances since 1998. This rule remains to this day.\n\nCurrent rules state that countries are allowed to have up to six performers on stage. Performers must be aged 16 or older, on the day of the semi-final in the year of the Contest. This rule was introduced in 1990, as two contestants the year before had been 11 and 12 years old. The introduction of this rule means that Sandra Kim, who was 13 when she won for Belgium in 1986, will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. No restriction on the nationality of the performers exists, which has resulted in countries being represented by artists who are not nationals of that country. One of the most well-known winning artists was Canadian Céline Dion who represented Switzerland in 1988. It should also be noted that the performer only needs to be 16 when the event takes place and not when they are selected, as proven when Lindsay Dracass was selected to represent the United Kingdom in 2001 and again when Triinu Kivilaan was selected to represent Switzerland in 2005, despite both of these performers only being 15 at their respective times of selection. In Dracass' case, she had to be issued a special visa to enable her to travel to Copenhagen.\n\nFrom the first Contest in 1956 until 1965, and again from 1973 until 1976 there was no restriction on language. From 1966 until 1972, and again from 1978 until 1998, songs were required to be performed in a national language. The national language rule was actually instituted shortly before the 1977 Contest, but some countries had already selected non-national language entries, and they were allowed to enter without any changes.\n\nAs of the 1999 Contest, the restriction was again lifted, and songs may be performed in any language. As a result, many of the songs are performed partially or completely in English. In 2003, Belgium made full use of the so-termed \"free language rule\", and entered a song, \"Sanomi\", in an artificial language created especially for the song. This proved successful as the country finished second, only two points behind Turkey. The same tactic was used in 2006 by the Dutch entry Treble which is partially sung in an artificial language and once again by Belgium with their 2008 entry \"O Julissi\".\n\nOn some occasions, dialects of a language or a very rare language have been used in a song entry:\n\nMany European countries were founded on ideas of linguistic unity and because of the sometimes unwelcome dominance of the English language in modern pop music, the language of a country's Eurovision entry can be a contentious issue. Some entries are performed in English to reach broader audiences, though this is sometimes looked upon as unpatriotic. In recent years up to 2007 the number of non-English language entrants has decreased, with mostly Israel, Ex-Yugoslavia(Mainly Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina) and, French language countries, Italy, Spain and Portugal performing in their native language. In terms of recent Contest performance, most non-English songs have been far less successful than those in English. Until 2007, the last wholly non-English language winner was Israel's Dana International, who performed Diva in Hebrew in 1998. The 2004 winner, Wild Dances performed by Ruslana, was partially sung in Ukrainian. After 2007 when Marija Šerifović won, singing in Serbian, the number of non-English contestants increased again in 2008 - almost half of the performers contested in their native language. The next non-English language winner, Amar Pelos Dois, performed in 2017 by Salvador Sobral, was sung entirely in Portuguese.\n\nIn some cases, the lyrics are written and recorded in two different versions (usually English and a national language) or a single multi-language version. Examples include:\n\n\n"}

The theatre presents approximately 400 performances each season, from September to June. The main theatre building is located next to the Mirabell Gardens and seats an audience of 707. The staff consists of 340 people originating from 35 different countries.\n\nThe theatre is a listed building and part of the \"Altstadt\", a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nIn 1775, Prince Archbishop Colloredo built the 'Prince Archbishop Court Theatre' on the site of the former ballroom of 1625. The official opening of the building was celebrated with Christian Heinrich Schmid’s \"Die Gunst des Fürsten\" which, beholden to enlightenment, was soon followed by Schiller’s dramas. Emmanuel Schikaneder was engaged as director of the Court Theatre for several years. During this time, he became acquainted with the Mozart family, whom he regularly invited to his box. Mozart's music was performed there for the first time in 1776. With the staging of \"Die Entführung aus dem Serail\" in 1784, regular performances of Mozart’s repertoire began.\nThe present building was constructed between 1892 and 1893, designed by the architect duo Fellner & Helmer. The building was opened on October 1, 1893 with the overture from Mozart’s \"La clemenza di Tito\". In this year, Max Reinhardt had been engaged as an actor in the company, and later co-founded the Salzburg Festival. Because of the Second World War, the theatre was closed in 1944. In 1945, American forces used the theatre as a radio studio. After the war, the theatre was opened to the public again.\n\nWith the introduction of the Studio Theatre in the former Mirabell Casino building in October 1971, the theatre acquired a new stage. Since 2010, there has been a close cooperation between the Salzburger State Theatre and the Salzburger Marionette Theatre. Besides joint productions, the theatre company also performs new productions in the Marionette Theatre’s space, now known as \"Bühne 24\".\n\nAdditionally, Salzburg’s Festival Theatres serve as performance locations for State Theatre productions throughout the year while the State Theatre building is used for Salzburg Festival productions during the festival season in the summer months. Another close partnership affiliates the State Theatre with the Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg which takes on the role of resident orchestra for the Theatre's musical productions.\n\nLutz Hochstraate, \"Intendant\" of the theatre from 1986 to 2004, introduced the programme for young audiences. From 2004 to 2009, Peter Dolder was \"Intendant\", and had a particular focus on the works of Thomas Bernhard. The current \"Intendant\" of the theatre is Carl Philip von Maldeghem, since 2009. The current director of opera is Katrin König, and the theatre's music director is Adrian Kelly.\n\n\n"}

The Prize is awarded to mathematicians normally resident in the United Kingdom on 1 January of the relevant year. Selection criteria include work in, influence on or service to mathematics, or recognition of lecturing gifts in the field of mathematics. Previous recipients of top LMS prizes or medals are ineligible for nomination.\n\nThe London Mathematical Society dates back to 1864. Augustus De Morgan's wife, writing after his death described how the London Mathematical Society was founded:- It was in the year 1864 that Mr Arthur Cowper Ranyard and George [George De Morgan, De_Morgan>Augustus De Morgan's son] were discussing mathematical problems during a walk in the streets, when it struck them that it would be very nice to have a society to which discoveries in mathematics could be brought, and where things could be discussed like the Astronomical Society. It was agreed between the young men that this should be proposed and that George should ask his father to take the chair at the first meeting. \n\nAt a preliminary meeting to discuss setting up the Society on 7 November 1864, the name 'London Mathematical Society' was chosen. This was not the first name which had been proposed which was 'London University Mathematics Society'. De Morgan first proposed that the name be 'University College Mathematics Society' but then, feeling that aiming at a wider membership would be sensible, he proposed 'London Mathematical Society'. In fact this November 1864 meeting was meant to be the first proper meeting of the Society but De Morgan was ill and could not attend. The chair at this preliminary meeting was taken by T A Hirst, the name of the Society was agreed, and the date for the first meeting proper was set for 16 January 1865. At the 16 January 1865 meeting, held in University College, Bloomsbury, north of central London, the chair was taken by Augustus De Morgan who gave the first address setting out what the aims and practices of the Society should be. \n\nThis meeting was attended by 27 mathematicians who were joined as members by a further 43 during the first year of the Society. Cayley, Clifford, De Morgan, Hirst, Maxwell, Salmon, Smith, Spottiswoode and Sylvester had all joined by the end of 1865. The first six Presidents of the Society are among the nine mathematicians we have just listed. It is worth noting that, except for De Morgan, who refused a Fellowship of the Royal Society, all presidents of the London Mathematical Society have been Fellows of the Royal Society of London.The Society rapidly expanded and moved away from its initial base in University College. Within two years of the founding of the Society it had moved into Burlington House, Piccadilly, occupying a room in the premises of the Royal Astronomical Society. There was, of course, already a connection with the Royal Astronomical Society since that Society had earlier absorbed the Spitalfields Mathematical Society. The Society rapidly gained international status, and two years after it was founded, in 1867, it instituted a category of honorary foreign member. The first such member was Chasles.From its foundation the Society decided that it would publish a journal, the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society. \n\nBetween the first meeting in January 1865 up to November 1866, 37 papers had been presented. However the membership had rapidly increased and the cost of distributing the Proceeding to the members would have been too expensive if all the papers had been published. To keep down costs only eleven of the 37 papers were published. Financial pressures continued on the young Society, largely caused by the high volume of papers it was receiving. Only a donation of £1000 by Rayleigh in 1874 allowed the Society to become financially secure. \n\nThe quantity and quality of papers published in the Proceeding was impressive, over 900 papers appearing by 1900.The London Mathematical Society established prestigious prizes early in its existence. Once the finances allowed, the Society began the award of its De Morgan Medal. It was awarded once every three years, the first award being made to Cayley in 1884. The next recipients were Sylvester (1887), Rayleigh (1890), Klein (1893), Roberts (1896), and Burnside (1899).\n\n\n"}

She herself was a survivor of a gang rape in Park Street, Kolkata. Referred to in the media only as the Park Street Rape victim, she publicly revealed her identity as a survivor of gang rape in 2013 to protest the spate of ongoing rapes and murders of women, and to encourage other survivors to speak out.\n\nUnder Indian law, the identity of a victim of rape cannot be revealed without the individual's permission. Until Jordan waived her right to anonymity in June 2013, her case had been dubbed the 'Park Street rape' by the Indian media, after the Kolkata street on which the attack took place in February 2012. When Jordan originally reported the crime, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, called her a liar and accused her of trying to embarrass the government, a position that provoked national outrage.\n\nWhen Jordan revealed her identity as a survivor of rape, she said, \"Why should I hide my identity when it was not even my fault? Why should I be ashamed of something that I did not give rise to? I was subjected to brutality, I was subjected to torture, and I was subjected to rape, and I am fighting and I will fight.\" At the time of her death, three of the five men accused of raping Jordan inside a moving car had been arrested and were on trial, although they denied the charges.

The murder was investigated in 1997 by CID Agents J. Choi, D. Zeliff, T. Barnes and B. Crow. Two troubled U.S. teenagers—Arthur Patterson (the son of a former U.S. Army officer and Korean mother) and Edward Lee—became suspects and were convicted. Patterson was released a year later in a special amnesty and Lee was freed a year after that due to lack of evidence. The case never resulted in further convictions. \nIt stars Jang Keun-suk as Arthur Patterson and Jung Jin-young as his lawyer. Song Joong-ki played the victim. The film had 531,068 admissions in South Korea nationwide.\n\n\nWith renewed public attention after the movie release, public prosecutors in South Korea reopened the case after discovering DNA evidence purported to show Patterson as the murderer. Edward Lee had previously testified to Patterson being the murderer during the first trial. Patterson was re-arrested by U.S. authorities in May 2011 and went before a court hearing in California concerning extradition to Korea for a new trial. Arthur Patterson's extradition to South Korea was approved and culminated with his arrival at Incheon International Airport, Sep. 2015. \n\nMurder Trial and Conviction\n\nDuring the four-month trial, Patterson repeatedly claimed that he was innocent and accused Lee of having killed Cho. Lee testified as a witness saying that he clearly saw Patterson turn to Cho to stab him. In January 2016, the prosecution sought a 20-year prison term for Patterson, which under Korean law is the maximum sentence able to be handed down to suspects aged 18 or less at the time of their crime. On January 28, 2016, Patterson was found guilty of the stabbing of the victim, Cho Jung-Pil, and was sentenced to 20 years behind bars. Patterson and his lawyers have said they plan to appeal the verdict.\n\nAppeals\n\nOn Monday, February 1, 2016, local officials in Seoul, South Korea, informed the public that Arthur Patterson lodged an appeal with a higher court. Patterson is still adamantly denying the charges and continues to blame Lee for the stabbing death of Cho Joong-Pil. The appeal will deal with issues such as evidence accepted by the court and its legitimacy, and possible mistakes in the application of law.\n\n"}

Produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, it is a performance of a new adaptation of the 1975 Broadway musical \"The Wiz\", a soul/R&B reinterpretation of L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\". The broadcast is performed live from Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York. This adaptation of the musical combines aspects of both the Broadway play and its 1978 film adaptation.\n\n\nPit voices were provided by Broadway Inspirational Voices.\n\nSource: Broadway World\n\n\nAll numbers composed by Charlie Smalls save for the following: \"Tornado\" is composed by Timothy Graphenreed and Harold Wheeler. \"Emerald City Ballet (Psst)\" is composed by Graphenreed and George Faison. \"We Got It\" is written by Ne-Yo, Elijah Kelley, Harvey Mason Jr, and Stephen Oremus. \"Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day\" is written by Luther Vandross.\n\nThe production, a co-production between Universal Television and Cirque du Soleil Theatrical – who provided special acrobatic performers for the \"Tornado\", \"You Can't Win\", and \"Funky Monkeys\" sequences – was a follow-up to NBC's live musical events, \"The Sound of Music Live!\" and \"Peter Pan Live!\". Like the previous specials, \"The Wiz Live!\" was televised from Grumman Studios in Bethpage, New York. The role of Dorothy was cast via an open audition; on August 5, 2015, it was announced on \"Today\" that Shanice Williams of New Jersey would fill the role in \"The Wiz Live!\". Williams had co-starred in local productions of \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" and \"West Side Story\" among others, and in 2014, was nominated for a Paper Mill Playhouse Rising Star Award for best leading actress.\n\nThe special was directed by Kenny Leon and adapted for television by Harvey Fierstein from the original musical's book by William F. Brown. Fatima Robinson was the program's choreographer, with Harvey Mason, Jr. and Stephen Oremus serving as the musical directors. Songs from the original Broadway production were featured, with two exceptions: \"You Can't Win\", a song cut from the musical and first used in its 1978 feature film adaptation as sung by Michael Jackson, was used in place of the Scarecrow's key number \"I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday\", and \"We Got It\", a new song composed by Harvey Mason Jr., Stephen Oremus with stars Ne-Yo and Elijah Kelley, was performed as Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion began their journey to find and kill the Wicked Witch of the West.\n\n\"The Wiz Live!\" was the first live TV program in US history to contain audio description for blind or visually impaired viewers.\n\nThe cost of a 30-second commercial during \"The Wiz\" ranged between $330,000 to $350,000, marking a drop from the $345,000 to $400,000 cost of ad time during \"Peter Pan Live!\". The decrease in ad cost was attributed to the modest viewership of \"Peter Pan\" in comparison to \"The Sound of Music Live!\", which an analyst felt was a result of the reduced novelty of the production in comparison to \"The Sound of Music\". Reddi-wip served as a main sponsor of the presentation; Walmart, which served as a major sponsor of NBC's previous live musicals, declined to participate. NBC produced themed commercials to air throughout the special as part of the brand's \"Share the Joy\" campaign; one, which was timed to air after the corresponding scene in the musical, featured \"A Brand New Day\" being performed by students of the Excel Academy in Hyattsville, Maryland—a school which ConAgra Foods had donated money to in support of musical arts.\n\n\"The Wiz Live!\" received positive reviews from critics, who praised the acting and singing abilities of the cast and for being an improvement over the two previous live NBC musicals. On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a 91% rating, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 8.8/10. The site's consensus states: \"\"The Wiz Live!\" is several notches above NBC's other musical broadcasts thanks to bold performances and large-scale production pieces.\" Metacritic reports a weighted average of 73 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n\"The Wiz Live!\" was seen by 11.5 million viewers, with a 3.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic. Although higher than \"Peter Pan Live!\", it trailed a \"Thursday Night Football\" game on CBS between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, which was seen by around 17 million. Average household viewership was notably higher in markets with a large African-American population, such as Atlanta, Baltimore, Norfolk, Richmond, and Washington, D.C. Nielsen also reported that the special produced the most social network interactions of any live television event in the past four years; there were three times as many Twitter postings related to \"The Wiz Live!\" than there were related to \"Peter Pan Live!\". NBC rebroadcast the special on December 19, 2015. The rebroadcast was seen by 1.6 million viewers.\n\n\nNBC released a DVD of the special on December 22, 2015, through Universal Studios Home Entertainment.

The tournament focuses primarily on younger wrestlers or wrestlers who work in the lower ranks of the promotion, generally the first or second match of the show, as a way to highlight or promote a wrestler up to a higher level of competition. A total of 27 individuals have competed in the two \"Sangre Nueva\" tournaments held as of 2014 with nine competitors participating in both tournaments held so far: Bobby Zavala, Camaleón, El Cholo, Disturbio, Hombre Bala Jr., Robin, Soberano Jr., Stigma and Super Halcón Jr.. Soberano Jr. is both the youngest competitor over-all (18 years and 206 days old) and the youngest tournament winner as well (19 days and 198 days old), while Cholo is the oldest (40 years and 56 days) at the time of his second tournament participation. Soberano Jr. was the lightest competitor and champion at while Bronco, at , was the heaviest of any tournament competitor so far.\n\nThe first ever Torneo Sangre Nueva took place in March 2012. Some of the competitors did not fit the \"New Blood\" tournaments, but in the case of wrestlers like Cancerbero and Raziel, the ring persona he portrayed had only been used for around 2 years, making the character a rookie, but not the man under the mask. CMLL has a history of not openly promoting the fact that some of their workers have worked under different identities previously. The tournament played out from March 6, 2012, until March 20, 2012, on CMLL's Tuesday shows in Arena Mexico. The first two shows had 8 wrestlers compete for a shot at the finals. Each night the eight wrestlers competed in a \"Seeding\" battle royal to determine the four on four \"Torneo cibernetico\" elimination match. On the first night El Cholo, Soberano Jr., Cancerbero, and Dragon Lee comprised one team while Bobby Zavala, Titán, Stigma and Camaleón on the other. Dragon Lee won the match, lastly eliminating Titán to win the match. The second block, on March 13, 2012 saw Disturbio, Hombre Bala Jr., Raziel, and Tritón team up to face Robin, Bronco, Hijo del Signo, and Super Halcón Jr. Raziel took the victory, eliminating Tritón to end the nearly 25 minute long match to move on to the finals. A week later, on March 20, 2012 Dragon Lee and Raziel faced off in the only three fall match of the night. Dragon Lee defeated Raziel to win the \"Torneo Sangre Nueva\".\n\nOn June 20, 2012, CMLL held a press conference, during which \"lucha libre\" priest Fray Tormenta announced that since Dragon Lee had impressed him with his in ring performance, Fray Tormenta wanted Dragon Lee to take over the role of Místico, his storyline protégé. Lee immediately accepted Tormenta's offer and received his new mask to officially become the second incarnation of Místico, taking over the highly successful role following the character's original performer, who had signed with WWE in January 2011. Titán entered CMLL's \"En Busca de un Ídolo\" (\"In search of an Idol\") a few months after narrowly missing out on the \"Sangre Nueva\" tournament finals. The tournament used a point system that allowed fans to vote online, allowing Titán to advance to the second round despite only winning one of his four first round matches. The fan support propelled Titán to the finale where he defeated Euforia to win the tournament. Titán would later defeat \"En Busca de un Ídolo\" rival Pólvora to win the Mexican National Welterweight Championship Cholo, Bobby Zavala, Soberano Jr., Camaleón, Stigma, Robin, Disturbio and Super Halcón Jr. would all compete in the subsequent \"Torneo Sangre Nueva\" in 2013.\n\nOn February 21, 2013, CMLL announced that they were holding another Torneo Sangre Nueva tournament in 2013, possibly making it an annual event. Like the first tournament the 2013 \"Sangre Nueva\" would feature two qualifying \"torneo cibernetico\" elimination matches with the winner of each facing off in a one-on-one match. In 2013 the \"cibernetico\" match included 10 competitors instead of the eight competitors in the previous year's tournament. The first match took place on February 26, 2013, in Arena Mexico and saw Soberano Jr. (son of CMLL wrestler Euforia) outlast Camaleón, Stigma, Höruz, Hombre Bala Jr., Akuma, Espanto Jr., Herodes Jr., Cholo and Bobby Zavala to qualify for the finals. During the match Höruz suffered a knee injury as a result of a dive out of the ring, the injury was believed to keep him out of the ring for three months. Block B competed on March 5, 2013, for the other finalist spot, with a field that included Genesis, Oro Jr., Robin, Sensei, Super Halcón Jr., Disturbio, Guerrero Negro Jr., Inquisidor, Taurus and Zayco. As with the 2012 \"Torneo Sangre Nueva\", not everyone competing in the tournament fit the \"new blood\" description; Sensei had worked for CMLL under that ring persona since 2005 and been a professional wrestler even longer. Inquisidor made his professional wrestling in 1995, but only adopted the Inquisidor name and mask in 2008, with CMLL officially not acknowledging his past history before becoming Inquisidor. The second Cibernetico was won by Taurus, son of Último Guerrero when he was the last wrestler in the ring, eliminating Guerrero Negro Jr. to earn his spot in the finals for the following week. The following week, Sobereano Jr. defeated Taurus, two falls to one to win the 2013 \"Sangre Nueva\" tournament.\n"}

Earlier that year, the French government had not sent a high-level representative to the funeral service for Governor General Georges Vanier. This attracted notice in Canada, as Vanier and his wife, Pauline, had been personal friends of de Gaulle since 1940, when the latter was in exile in London, England. In April, de Gaulle did not attend the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge. So worried was the Pearson government about potential interference of France in domestic affairs that Secretary of State for External Affairs, Paul Martin, was dispatched to visit de Gaulle in Paris to mend the two countries' relationship. The \"Montreal Gazette\" speculated, 45 years after the incident, that de Gaulle was still annoyed over a perceived slight from World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King's slow recognition of the new French government in late summer 1944.\n\nIn the spring of 1966, as part of the Expo 67 diplomatic protocols, de Gaulle and all world leaders whose countries had an exhibit at the fair were invited to visit Canada during the spring and summer of 1967. A few months later, de Gaulle was also sent a separate invitation to visit Quebec by Quebec premier Daniel Johnson. Although a visiting head of state, the president did not arrive in the Canadian capital, Ottawa, as would be conventional protocol. Instead, he took the time to sail on the French navy's Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser \"Colbert\", so that he could arrive in Quebec City, the capital city of the province of Quebec. There, de Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, Roland Michener, was booed by the same crowd when \"God Save the Queen\" was played at his arrival. In his speech, de Gaulle spoke of his country’s \"evolving\" ties with Quebec, hinting at his support for Quebec sovereignty.\n\nOn July 15, before boarding the \"Colbert\", de Gaulle told Xavier Deniau: \"They will hear me over there, it will make waves!\" He also confided to his son-in-law General Alain de Boissieu that: \"I am going to strike a strong blow. Things are going to get hot. But it is necessary. It is the last chance to rectify the cowardice of France.\" De Gaulle was referring to what he viewed as France's abandonment of 70,000 French colonists to the British after France was defeated in the North American theatre of the Seven Years' War in 1763.\n\nOn July 24, de Gaulle arrived in Montreal and was driven up the \"Chemin du Roy\" to Montreal City Hall, where Mayor Jean Drapeau and Premier Johnson waited. De Gaulle was not scheduled to speak that evening, but the crowd chanted for him; he told Drapeau: \"I have to speak to those people who are calling for me\". According to a number of personal interviews with high-ranking French officials, as well as documents he uncovered, scholar Dale C. Thomson wrote that de Gaulle's statement was planned, and that he used it when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nDe Gaulle stepped out onto the balcony to give a short address to the assembled masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the liberation from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words (\"Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!\"), but he then added, (\"Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!\"), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, . De Gaulle particularly emphasized the use of the word , as he leaned into the microphones and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.\n\nThis statement, coming from the French head of state, was considered a serious breach of diplomatic protocol. It emboldened the Quebec sovereignty movement, and produced tensions between the leadership of the two countries. The crowd's reaction to De Gaulle's phrase was emotional, and has been described as frenzied, but it sparked controversy with English Canadians, as many were outraged at the implied threat to Canada's territorial integrity. Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson rebuked de Gaulle with an official statement, delivered to the French Embassy on July 25, and read on national television that evening. He said \"The people of Canada are free. Every province in Canada is free. Canadians do not need to be liberated. Indeed, many thousands of Canadians gave their lives in two world wars in the liberation of France and other European countries.\"\n\nA media and diplomatic uproar ensued thereafter, which resulted in de Gaulle cutting short his visit to Canada. The day after the speech, de Gaulle visited Expo 67 and hosted a banquet at the French pavilion. On July 26, instead of continuing his visit on to Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pearson, he decided to return to France on a French military jet.\n\nThe newly appointed Canadian minister of justice, Pierre Trudeau publicly wondered what the French reaction would have been if a Canadian Prime Minister shouted, \"Brittany to the Bretons\". From then on, de Gaulle remained unimpressed by Trudeau, saying (\"We have not one concession, nor even any courtesy, to extend to Mr. Trudeau, who is the enemy of the 'French fact' in Canada.\") De Gaulle was also heavily criticized by a large part of the French media for his breach of international protocol, in particular by \"Le Monde\".\n\nMeanwhile, to members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the speech was viewed as a watershed moment. Occurring soon after the Quiet Revolution, and taking into account the low economic and political state of French Canadians at the time, the support of a foreign head of state seemed to add credibility to the movement in the eyes of many, including future Quebec premier René Lévesque.\n\nOn the flight home from Montreal, de Gaulle told René de Saint-Légier de la Saussaye—his diplomatic counsellor—that the event was \"a historical phenomenon that was perhaps foreseeable but it took a form that only the situation itself could determine. Of course, like many others I could have got away with a few polite remarks or diplomatic acrobatics, but when one is General De Gaulle, one does not have recourse to such expedients. What I did, I had to do it.\"\n\nIn 1969, de Gaulle visited Brittany, during which, in Quimper, he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called Charles de Gaulle) in the Breton language, expressing devotion to Breton culture. The speech, well received by the crowd, followed a series of crackdowns on Breton nationalism. He was accused of double standards for, on the one hand demanding a \"free\" Quebec because of its linguistic differences from English-speaking Canada, while on the other oppressing the movement in Brittany. During this Quimper speech, he replied to this criticism that Brittany was free and had been freed by Bretons and other French forces during the Liberation, reminding that the Resistance was more intense in Brittany than in any other part of France, and that many Bretons had joined the Free French Forces.\n\n\n"}
