{"id": "6633966", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6633966", "title": "'Obby 'Oss festival", "text": "'Obby 'Oss festival\n\nThe 'Obby 'Oss festival is a folk custom that takes place each May Day in Padstow, a coastal town in the southwest English county of Cornwall. It involves two separate processions making their way around the town, each containing an eponymous hobby horse known as the 'Obby 'Oss.\n\nThe festival starts at midnight on May Eve when townspeople gather outside the Golden Lion Inn to sing the \"Night Song.\" By morning, the town has been dressed with greenery and flowers placed around the maypole. The excitement begins with the appearance of one of the 'Obby 'Osses. Male dancers cavort through the town dressed as one of two 'Obby 'Osses, the \"Old\" and the \"Blue Ribbon\" 'Obby 'Osses; as the name suggests, they are stylised kinds of horses. Prodded on by acolytes known as \"Teasers,\" each wears a mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. Throughout the day, the two parades, led by the \"MC\" in his top hat and decorated stick, followed by a band of accordions and drums, then the 'Oss and the Teaser, with a host of people, the \"Mayers\" - all singing the \"Morning Song.\" – pass along the streets of the town. Finally, late in the evening, the two 'osses meet, at the maypole, before returning to their respective stables where the crowd sings of the 'Obby 'Oss death, until its resurrection the following May Eve.\n\nDuring the twentieth century the existence of the festival was described by a number of folklorists who brought greater attention to it. This helped to turn the event as a popular tourist attraction and establish it as one of the most famous folk customs in Britain.\n\nThe festival takes place on May Day every year. It entails two separate processions that make their way around Padstow on circuits that take twelve hours to traverse. Each procession represents a different half of the town's community.\nOnly those whose families have lived in Padstow for at least two generations are permitted to take part in the processions.\nEach procession contains by an 'Obby 'Oss, a hobby horse consisting of an oval frame covered in black oilskin, which has a small horse's head in the front with a snapping jaw. This is led by an individual known as the Teaser, who is dressed in white and carries a painted club. The procession also contains a retinue of white-clad individuals, some playing accordions and drums.\n\nThis retinue sings a local version of a Mayers' song. At times this tune becomes a dirge, at which the 'Obby 'Oss sinks to the ground and lies flat. When the chorus becomes triumphant again the 'Oss rises and continues along the procession.\n\nThe origins of the celebrations in Padstow are unknown. There is extensive documentary evidence of British community May Day celebrations in the 16th century and earlier, although the earliest mention of the \"Obby 'Oss\" at Padstow dates from 1803. An earlier hobby horse is mentioned in the Cornish language drama \"Beunans Meriasek\", a life of the Camborne saint, where it is associated with a troupe, or \"companions.\"\nThere is no evidence to suggest that the 'Obby 'Oss festival is older than the eighteenth century.\n\nIt has been speculated that such festivals have pre-Christian origins, such as in the Celtic festival of Beltane in the Celtic nations, and the Germanic celebrations during the Þrimilci-mōnaþ (literally \"Three-Milking Month\" or \"Month of Three Milkings\") in England.\n\nThe custom attracted little attention outside of the town until 1907, when the folklorist Francis Etherington drew attention to it. In 1913 the folklorist Thurstan Peter wrote about it; influenced by the ideas of the anthropologist James Frazer, Peter argued that the 'Obby 'Oss custom might have once been a pre-Christian religious ritual designed to secure fertility. The idea that the custom had pre-Christian roots helped to convert it into a tourist attraction. This idea of the custom as an pre-Christian one percolated into the Padstow community, for when the historian Ronald Hutton visited the town in 1985 he found locals describing it to him as an ancient pagan fertility rite.\n\nBy the 1990s, the 'Obby 'Oss festival was a major attraction that drew large numbers of visitors to Padstow. By that point, Hutton referred to it as \"one of the most famous and most dramatic folk customs of modern Britain\", adding that it constituted \"a tremendous reaffirmation of communal pride and solidarity in this small and normally quiet settlement\".\n\nThe celebration itself starts at midnight on 1 May with unaccompanied singing around the town starting at the Golden Lion Inn. By the morning, the town is dressed with greenery, flowers and flags, with the focus being the maypole.\nThe climax arrives when two groups of dancers progress through the town, one of each team wearing a stylised recreation of a 'horse.' The two 'osses are known as the \"Old\" and the \"Blue Ribbon\" 'osses. During the day a number of \"Junior\" or \"colt\" 'osses appear, operated by children. Accompanied by drums and accordions and led by acolytes known as \"Teasers\", each 'oss is adorned by a gruesome mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. The Blue ribbon 'oss is apparently of more recent origin. In the late 19th century it was supported by members of the Temperance movement who were trying to discourage the consumption of alcohol associated with the \"old\" 'oss followers. After the first world war the imperative of temperance was lost, and the 'oss became known as the \"Peace 'Oss\". Each 'oss has a \"stable\" (in the case of the \"Old 'Oss\", the Golden Lion Inn and the \"Blue Ribbon 'Oss\", the Institute, from which they emerge at the start of the day's proceedings and retire at the end. Sometimes in the late afternoon, the 'osses may meet at the maypole and dance together.\n\n'Obby 'Oss traditions also exist in nearby Barnstaple and Combe Martin.\n\nMinehead in Somerset also has two large hobby horses, the Sailors' Horse and the Town Horse. Although more pointed or boat-shaped than the Padstow 'Osses, they are similar in that the dancer within the costume wears a tall, conical hat with a grotesque mask over their face; the horse framework is suspended from the dancer's shoulders and a long skirt hangs down to partly hide their body; the animal's heads are small and wooden with snapping jaws. They also capture bystanders.\n\nThere is documentary evidence of an 'Oss at Penzance in the late 19th century, made with a caped stick and skull which has formed the basis of the Penglaz 'Obby 'Oss which appears during the Golowan festival and the Montol Festival; the 'oss is strikingly similar to the Mari Lwyd in Wales associated with the pre Christian deity Rhiannon, known as Epona the horse goddess in continental Celtic cultures, passing into festive folklore as 'the Old Grey Mare' in neighbouring parts of Britain e.g. Dartmoor (Widecombe Fair (song)), Dorset (The Grey Mare and her Colts).\n\nSimilar Corpus Christi (May–June) folk tradition exists in Galicia in Spain and Portugal where St George fights a dragon in the manner of the Cornish Mummers Plays. Tinsel cloaked street entertainers dress as the Welsh Mari Llywd but the snapping animal skull might be a goat or fox rather than horse and depicts the Coco or the Peluda.\nThe Tarasque procession from southern France has direct pre-Roman Celtic antecedents and a terrifying ancient Celtic sculpture at the Musée lapidaire d'Avignon depicts the monster hoarding severed human heads .\n\nThere are some similarities between this festival and the Lajkonik hobby-horse festival in Kraków, Poland. In particular the idea that young women may be captured or struck with a stick to bring them \"luck\" or fertility suggests a pagan, or at least medieval origin. Lajkonik is 700 years old.\n\nRather more recent is the Banbury Hobby-Horse festival, which started in 2000, and features ritual animals from all parts of the British Isles.\n\n\"Padstow's Obby Oss and May Day Festivities\" (1999), Donald R Rawe\n\nJason Semmens, “Guising, Ritual and Revival: The Hobby Horse in Cornwall.” \"Old Cornwall\" 13, No. 6 (2005) pp. 39–46.\n\nJ Herman Gilligan (1990a) 'Padstow: Economic and Social Change in a Cornish Town' in Harris C C (ed),\n\nJ Herman Gilligan (1987) 'Visitors, Tourists and Outsiders in a Cornish Town', in Bouquet M and Winter M (eds),\nWho From Their Labours Rest?: Conflict and Practice in Rural Tourism, Aldershot: Avebury\n\n"}

Twenty-two people died and twenty-eight were injured. The accident remains the third-deadliest aircraft accident in the United States involving victims on the ground, after the USAF KC-135 Wichita crash in 1965, and the Green Ramp disaster in 1994, which killed 23 and 24 people on the ground, respectively.\n\nThe jet failed to gain sufficient altitude upon takeoff, with eyewitnesses suggesting the nose was over-rotated. The F-86 Sabre has a dangerous and often fatal handling characteristic upon takeoff if the nose is raised prematurely from the runway. This handling characteristic of the F-86 was acknowledged from the early 1950s.\n\nThe aircraft over-ran the runway, struck an earthen berm, and ripped through a chain link fence. Two external underwing fuel tanks ruptured and ignited upon impact with the fence, creating a massive fireball. The plane continued across Freeport Boulevard, crashing into a moving car, and struck at a local Farrell's Ice Cream Parlor at approximately 4:25 pm. The parlor was occupied in part by the Sacramento 49ers \"Little League\" football team.\n\nTwenty-two people died, including twelve children. An eight-year-old survivor of the accident lost nine family members: both parents, two brothers, a sister, two grandparents and two cousins. A family of four also died in the accident. Two people were killed in the car struck on Freeport Boulevard. Immediately after the crash an elderly couple trying to cross the street to the crash site were struck by a vehicle, killing the wife. The crash could have claimed many more lives if the external fuel tanks had not ruptured prior to impact, or if the jet had not been slowed by hitting the moving car and other vehicles parked in front of the restaurant. The pilot suffered a broken leg and broken arm.\n\nThe Canadair Sabre was a single-engine jet fighter built for the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1959. The Sabre was withdrawn from service in 1961 and placed in long-term storage. It was sold as surplus in the United States in 1971 and was bought by Spectrum Air, Inc., of Novato, California in the same year.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the accident was a result of pilot error due to lack of experience on the jet. Bingham had logged less than four hours flying time in the Sabre. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) modified the rules governing the flight of ex-military jets over densely populated areas, and mandated clearance for such flights. Pilot requirements were also tightened: they would require a checkout by the manufacturer or military, and take-offs and landings would have to be observed by an FAA inspector to confirm proficiency.\n\nThe Firefighters Burn Institute was instituted a year after the crash, funded from donations given to local firefighters.\n\nIn 2002, a memorial was built at the site of the accident and dedicated in March 2003. It consists of: a rose garden with two benches, a fountain, a concrete marker and two metal plaques with the names of those who died.\n\nIn 2012, a service to commemorate the 40th anniversary was held to remember the victims of the accident.\n\n"}

Seventy-eight people, including twenty-seven men, fifteen women, and fifteen children, were killed, while seven more were injured. Most of the victims were residents of the Mumbai slums, where building and sanitation conditions are very poor. Government officials promised that the immediate family of each deceased victim would receive Rs 25,000 from the government, while the immediate family of each injured would receive Rs 10,000. Over one hundred and fifty firefighter personnel participated in search and rescue efforts, though officials reported little hope of finding any more survivors two days after the initial landslide occurred. The landslide was caused by land erosion, following heavy rains and subsequent flooding that coincided with a high tide in the Bay of Bengal. According to meteorologists, more than three hundred and fifty millimeters of rain fell on the suburbs of Mumbai in the twenty-four-hour period before the landslide. In the years since the 2000 Mumbai landslide, Mumbai has been determined by the Municipal Corporation Building to contain 327 areas that are in danger of landslides, including 49 in the city and 278 in the suburbs. Since this revelation, thousands of huts have been relocated or reinforced to protect the inhabitants from landslides.\n"}

The series ran on PTV from May till July 1998. The last shooting was completed at PMA Kakul on 4 December 1997. The drama was produced by PTV Lahore centre and Shoman Productions.\n\nThe events in the drama involve romance and comedy, while reflecting the Pakistan Army's operational involvement in the Bosnian War and Siachen conflict.\n\nAs the name indicates, the drama is based on the life and times of three characters — Faraz, Kashif, and Gulsher also known as Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie respectively — and their friendship. These passionate young men wish to start their careers in the Pakistan army. In the initial episodes, ample footage is used to detail the background of every individual and the circumstances under which they enroll for the armed forces. Faraz is Mr Perfect, the guy who does everything right while Gulsher is a polite, simple-minded, shy person. Kashif is originally the funny man responsible for providing most of the comic relief through his antics, pranks and mischief. Eventually the series morphs into a coming-of-age story where the lead characters realize that there is more to life than their present happy-go-lucky lifestyle as they experience reality in all its fragility and extremities — jealousy, heartbreaks, trauma and death. Another important character is Shahnaaz, a confident, educated and well-mannered young lady, who plays an important role in the lives of these friends. Her involvement with them in the role of friend, wife and confidante adds reality to the series that is poignant and touching on a personal level. The main theme of the drama is that every person should lead a purposeful existence and that, if one has the will and the passion, he/she can achieve anything.\n\n"}

{"id": "3332", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3332", "title": "Ballroom dance", "text": "Ballroom dance\n\nBallroom dance is a set of partner dances, which are enjoyed both socially and competitively around the world. Because of its performance and entertainment aspects, ballroom dance is also widely enjoyed on stage, film, and television.\n\n\"Ballroom dance\" may refer, at its widest definition, to almost any type of partner dancing as recreation. However, with the emergence of dancesport in modern times, the term has become narrower in scope and traditionally refers to the five International Standard and five International Latin style dances (see dance categories below). The two styles, while differing in technique, rhythm and costumes, exemplify core elements of ballroom dancing such as control and cohesiveness. Developed in England, the two styles are now regulated by the World Dance Council (WDC) and the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF). In the United States, two additional variations are popular: \"American Smooth\" and \"American Rhythm\", which combine elements of the Standard and Latin styles with influences from other dance traditions.\n\nThere are also a number of historical dances, and local or national dances, which may be danced in ballrooms or salons. Sequence dancing, in pairs or other formations, is still a popular style of ballroom dance.\n\nThe term 'ballroom dancing' is derived from the word \"ball\" which in turn originates from the Latin word \"ballare\" which means 'to dance' (a ball-room being a large room specially designed for such dances). In times past, ballroom dancing was social dancing for the privileged, leaving folk dancing for the lower classes. These boundaries have since become blurred. The definition of ballroom dance also depends on the era: balls have featured popular dances of the day such as the Minuet, Quadrille, Polonaise, Polka, Mazurka, and others, which are now considered to be historical dances.\n\nThe first authoritative knowledge of the earliest ballroom dances was recorded toward the end of the 16th century, when Jehan Tabourot, under the pen name \"Thoinot-Arbeau\", published in 1588 his \"Orchésographie\", a study of late 16th-century French renaissance social dance. Among the dances described were the solemn basse danse, the livelier branle, pavane, and the galliarde which Shakespeare called the \"cinq pace\" as it was made of five steps.\n\nIn 1650 the Minuet, originally a peasant dance of Poitou, was introduced into Paris and set to music by Jean-Baptiste Lully and danced by the King Louis XIV in public. The Minuet dominated the ballroom from that time until the close of the 18th century.\n\nToward the latter half of the 16th century, Louis XIV founded his 'Académie Royale de Musique et de Danse', where specific rules for the execution of every dance and the \"five positions\" of the feet were formulated for the first time by members of the Académie. Eventually, the first definite cleavage between ballet and ballroom came when professional dancers appeared in the ballets, and the ballets left the Court and went to the stage. Ballet technique such as the turned out positions of the feet, however, lingered for over two centuries and past the end of the Victoria era.\n\nThe waltz with its modern hold took root in England in about 1812; in 1819 Carl Maria von Weber wrote \"Invitation to the Dance\", which marked the adoption of the waltz form into the sphere of absolute music. The dance was initially met with tremendous opposition due to the semblance of impropriety associated with the closed hold, though the stance gradually softened. In the 1840s several new dances made their appearance in the ballroom, including the polka, mazurka, and the Schottische. In the meantime a strong tendency emerged to drop all 'decorative' steps such as \"entrechats\" and \"ronds de jambes\" that had found a place in the Quadrilles and other dances.\n\nModern ballroom dance has its roots early in the 20th century, when several different things happened more or less at the same time. The first was a movement away from the sequence dances towards dances where the couples moved independently. This had been pre-figured by the waltz, which had already made this transition. The second was a wave of popular music, such as jazz. Since dance is to a large extent tied to music, this led to a burst of newly invented dances. There were many dance crazes in the period 1910–1930.\n\nThe third event was a concerted effort to transform some of the dance crazes into dances which could be taught to a wider dance public in the U.S. and Europe. Here Vernon and Irene Castle were important, and so was a generation of English dancers in the 1920s, including Josephine Bradley and Victor Silvester. These professionals analysed, codified, published, and taught a number of standard dances. It was essential, if popular dance was to flourish, for dancers to have some basic movements they could confidently perform with any partner they might meet. Here the huge Arthur Murray organisation in America, and the dance societies in England, such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, were highly influential. Finally, much of this happened during and after a period of World War, and the effect of such a conflict in dissolving older social customs was considerable.\n\nLater, in the 1930s, the on-screen dance pairing of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers influenced all forms of dance in the U.S. and elsewhere. Although both actors had separate careers, their filmed dance sequences together, which included portrayals of the Castles, have reached iconic status. Much of Astaire and Rogers' work portrayed social dancing, although the performances were highly choreographed (often by Astaire or Hermes Pan) and meticulously staged and rehearsed.\n\nCompetitions, sometimes referred to as dancesport, range from world championships, regulated by the World Dance Council (WDC), to less advanced dancers at various proficiency levels. Most competitions are divided into professional and amateur, though in the USA pro-am competitions typically accompany professional competitions. The International Olympic Committee now recognizes competitive ballroom dance. It has recognized another body, the World DanceSport Federation (WDSF), as the sole representative body for dancesport in the Olympic Games. However, it seems doubtful that dance will be included in the Olympic Games, especially in light of efforts to reduce the number of participating sports.\n\nBallroom dance competitions are regulated by each country in its own way. There are about 30 countries which compete regularly in international competitions. There are another 20 or so countries which have membership of the WDC and/or the WDSF, but whose dancers rarely appear in international competitions. In Britain there is the British Dance Council, which grants national and regional championship titles, such as the British Ballroom Championships, the British Sequence Championships and the United Kingdom Championships. In the United States, the member branches of the WDC (National Dance Council of America) and the WDSF (USA Dance) both grant national and regional championship titles.\n\nBallroom dancing competitions in the former USSR also included the Soviet Ballroom dances, or \"Soviet Programme\". Australian New Vogue is danced both competitively and socially. In competition there are 15 recognised New Vogue dances, which are performed by the competitors in sequence. These dance forms are not recognised internationally, neither are the US variations such as American Smooth, and Rhythm. Such variations in dance and competition methods are attempts to meets perceived needs in the local market-place.\n\nInternationally, the Blackpool Dance Festival, hosted annually at Blackpool, England, is considered the most prestigious event a dancesport competitor can attend.\n\nFormation dance is another style of competitive dance recognised by the IDSF. In this style, multiple dancers (usually in couples and typically up to 16 dancers at one time) compete on the same team, moving in and out of various formations while dancing.\n\nIn competitive ballroom, dancers are judged by diverse criteria such as poise, the hold or frame, posture, musicality and expression, timing, body alignment and shape, floor craft, foot and leg action, and presentation. Judging in a performance-oriented sport is inevitably subjective in nature, and controversy and complaints by competitors over judging placements are not uncommon. The scorekeepers—called scrutineers—will tally the total number recalls accumulated by each couple through each round until the finals, when the Skating system is used to place each couple by ordinals, typically 1–6, though the number of couples in the final may vary. Sometimes, up to 8 couples may be present on the floor during the finals.\n\nCompetitors dance at different levels based on their ability and experience. The levels are split into two categories, syllabus and open. The syllabus levels are newcomer/pre-bronze, bronze, silver, and gold—with gold the highest syllabus level and newcomer the lowest. In these levels, moves are restricted to those written in syllabus, and illegal moves can lead to disqualification. Each level, bronze, silver, and gold, has different moves on their syllabus, increasing in difficulty. There are three levels in the open category; novice, pre-champ, and champ in increasing order of skill. At those levels, dancers no longer have restrictions on their moves, so complex routines are more common.\n\nMedal evaluations for amateurs enable dancers' individual abilities to be recognized according to conventional standards. In medal evaluations, which are run by bodies such as the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) and the United Kingdom Alliance (UKA), each dancer performs two or more dances in a certain genre in front of a judge. Genres such as Modern Ballroom or Latin are the most popular. Societies such as the ISTD and UKA also offer medal tests on other dance styles (such as Country & Western, Rock 'n Roll or Tap). In some North American examinations, levels include Newcomer, Bronze, Silver, Gold, Novice, Pre-championship, and Championship; each level may be further subdivided into either two or four separate sections.\n\nThere is a part of the ballroom world dedicated to college students. These chapters are typically clubs or teams that have an interest in ballroom dancing. Teams hold fundraisers, social events, and ballroom dance lessons. Ballroom dance teams' goals are to have fun and learn to dance well. There is a strong focus on finding a compatible dance partner and bonding with teammates. There is also a competitive side to collegiate ballroom - collegiate teams often hold competitions and invite other teams to participate. These competitions are often run with many of the same rules are regular amateur competitions as outlined above, but are usually organized entirely by collegiate teams. Examples include the MIT Open Ballroom Dance Competition, Purdue Ballroom Classic, Cardinal Classic, Berkeley Classic, and Harvard Invitational.\n\n\"Ballroom dance\" refers most often to the ten dances of International Ballroom (or Standard) and International Latin, though the term is also often used interchangeably with the five International Ballroom dances. Sequence dancing, which is danced predominantly in the United Kingdom, and its development New Vogue in Australia and New Zealand, are also sometimes included as a type of Ballroom dancing.\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the American Style (American Smooth and American Rhythm) also exists. The dance technique used for both International and American styles is similar, but International Ballroom allows only closed dance positions, whereas American Smooth allows closed, open and separated dance movements. In addition, different sets of dance figures are usually taught for the two styles. International Latin and American Rhythm have different styling, and have different dance figures in their respective syllabi.\n\nOther dances sometimes placed under the umbrella \"ballroom dance\" include nightclub dances such as Lindy Hop, West Coast swing, nightclub two step, hustle, salsa, and merengue. The categorization of dances as \"ballroom dances\" has always been fluid, with new dances or folk dances being added to or removed from the ballroom repertoire from time to time, so no list of subcategories or dances is any more than a description of current practices. There are other dances historically accepted as ballroom dances, and are revived via the vintage dance movement.\n\nIn Europe, Latin Swing dances include Argentine tango, mambo, Lindy Hop, swing boogie (sometimes also known as nostalgic boogie), and disco fox. One example of this is the subcategory of cajun dances that originated in Acadiana, with branches reaching both coasts of the United States.\n\nBallroom/Smooth dances are normally danced to Western music (often from the mid-twentieth century), and couples dance counter-clockwise around a rectangular floor following the line of dance. In competitions, competitors are costumed as would be appropriate for a white tie affair, with full gowns for the ladies and bow tie and tail coats for the men; though in American Smooth it is now conventional for the men to abandon the tailsuit in favor of shorter tuxedos, vests, and other creative outfits.\n\nLatin/Rhythm dances are commonly danced to contemporary Latin American music and (in case of jive) Western music. With the exception of a few traveling dances like samba and pasodoble, couples do not follow the line of dance but perform their routines more or less in one spot. In competitions, the women are often dressed in short-skirted Latin outfits while the men are outfitted in tight-fitting shirts and pants, the goal being to emphasize the dancers' leg action and body movements.\n\nWaltz began as a country folk dance in Austria and Bavaria in the 17th century. In the early 19th century it was introduced in England. It was the first dance where a man held a woman close to his body. When performing the dance, the upper body is kept to the left throughout all figures, woman's body leaves the right side of the man while the head is extended to follow the elbow. Figures with rotation have little rise. Sway is also used on the second step to make the step longer and also to slow down the momentum by bringing the feet together. Waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\nViennese waltz originated in Provence area in France in 1559 and is recognized as the oldest of all ballroom dances. It was introduced in England as German waltz in 1812 and became popular throughout the 19th century by the music of Josef and Johann Strauss. It is often referred to as the classic “old-school” ballroom.Viennese Waltz music is quite fast. Slight shaping of the body moves towards the inside of the turn and shaping forward and up to lengthen the opposite side from direction. Reverse turn is used to travel down long side and is overturned. While natural turn is used to travel short side and is underturned to go around the corners. Viennese waltz is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\nTango originated in Buenos Aires in the late 19th century. Modern Argentine tango is danced in both open and closed embraces which focuses on the male leader and the women moving in harmony of the tango’s passionate charging music. The tango’s technique is like walking to the music while keeping feet grounded and allowing ankles and knees to brush against one another during each step taken. Body weight is kept over the toes and the connection is held between the man and women in the hips.\n\nBallroom tango, however, is a dance with a far more open frame, often utilising strong and staccato movements. Ballroom tango, rather than Argentine tango, is performed in international competition.\n\nThe foxtrot is an American dance, credited by a vaudeville performer Harry Fox in 1914. Fox was rapidly trotting step to ragtime music. The dance was originally named as the “Fox’s trot”. The foxtrot can be danced at slow, medium, or fast tempos depending on the speed of the jazz or big band music. The partners are facing one another and frame rotates from one side to another, changing direction after a measure. The dance is flat, with no rise and fall like the waltz. The walking steps are taken as slow for the two beats per steps and quick for one beat per step. Foxtrot is performed for both International Standard and American Smooth.\n\nThe quickstep is an English dance and was invented in the 1920s as a combination of faster tempo of foxtrot and the Charleston. It is a fast moving dance, so men are allowed to close their feet and the couples move in short syncopated steps. Quickstep includes the walks, runs, chasses, and turns of the original foxtrot dance, with some other fast figures such as locks, hops, and skips. Quick step is performed as an International Standard dance.\n\nThe pasodoble originated from Spain and its dramatic bullfights. The dance is mostly performed only in competitions and rarely socially because of its many choreographic rules. The man plays the role of the matador while the woman takes the role of the matador’s cape, the bull, or even the matador. The chassez cape refers to the man using the woman to turn her as if she is the cape, and the apel is when the man stomps his foot to get the bull's attention. Pasodoble is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\nThe Spanish bolero was developed in the late 18th century out of the \"seguidilla\", and its popularization is attributed to court dancers such as Sebastián Cerezo. It became one of the most popular ballroom dances of the 19th century and saw many classical adaptations. However, by the 20th century it had become old-fashioned. A Cuban music genre of the same name, bolero, which became popular in the early 20th century, is unrelated to the Spanish dance.\n\nAlthough Cuban bolero was born as a form of \"trova\", traditional singer/songwriter tradition from eastern Cuba, with no associated dance, it soon became a ballroom favorite in Cuba and all of Latin America. The dance most commonly represents the couple falling in love. Modern bolero is seen as a combination of many dances: like a slow salsa with contra-body movement of tango, patterns of rhumba, and rise and fall technique and personality of waltz and foxtrot. Bolero can be danced in a closed hold or singly and then coming back together. It is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\nSamba is the national dance of Brazil. The rhythm of samba and its name originated from the language and culture of West African slaves. In 1905, samba became known to other countries during an exhibition in Paris. In the 1940s, samba was introduced in America through Carmen Miranda. The international version of Ballroom Samba has been based on an early version of Brazilian Samba called Maxixe, but has since developed away and differs strongly from Brazilian Ballroom Samba, which is called Samba de Gafieira. International Ballroom Samba is danced with a slight bounce which is created through the bending and straightening the knee. It is performed as an International Latin dance, although most of its modern development has occurred outside Latin America.\n\nRhumba came to the United States from Cuba in the 1920s and became a popular cabaret dance during prohibition. Rhumba is a ballroom adaptation of son cubano and bolero (the Cuban genre) and, despite its name, it rarely included elements of Cuban rumba. It includes Cuban motions through knee-strengthening, figure-eight hip rotation, and swiveling foot action. An important characteristic of rhumba is the powerful and direct lead achieved through the ball of the foot. Rhumba is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\nMambo was developed as an off-shoot of danzón, the national dance of Cuba, in the late 1930s by Orestes López and his brother Cachao, of Arcaño y sus Maravillas. They conceived a new form of danzón influenced by son cubano, with a faster, improvised final section, which allowed dancers to more freely express themselves, given that danzón had traditionally a very rigid structure. In the 1940s, Dámaso Pérez Prado transformed the mambo from the charanga into the big band format, and took it to Mexico and the United States, where it became a \"dance craze\".\n\nCha-cha-cha (sometimes called cha-cha in the US) was delevoped by Enrique Jorrín in the early 1950s, as a slower alternative to mambo. Cha-cha-cha is a flirtatious dance with many hip rotations and partners synchronising their movements. The dance includes bending and straightening of the knee giving it a touch of Cuban motion. Cha-cha is performed for both International Latin and American Rhythm.\n\nSwing in 1927 was originally named the Lindy Hop named by Shorty George Snowden. There have been 40 different versions documented over the years; most common is the East Coast swing which is performed in the American Smooth (or American Rhythm) only in the U.S. or Canada. The East Coast swing was established by Arthur Murray and others only shortly after World War II. Swing music is very lively and upbeat and can be danced to jazz or big band music. The swing dancing is a style with lots of bounce and energy. Swing also includes many spins and underarm turns. East Coast swing is performed as an American Rhythm dance.\n\nThe jive is part of the swing dance group and is a very lively variation of the jitterbug. Jive originated from African American clubs in the early 1940s. During World War II, American soldiers introduced the jive in England where it was adapted to today's competitive jive. In jive, the man leads the dance while the woman encourages the man to ask them to dance. It is danced to big band music, and some technique is taken from salsa, swing and tango. Jive is performed as an International Latin dance.\n\nAccording to World Dance Council.\n\nWaltz:\n28 bars per minute, 3/4 time, also known as \"Slow Waltz\" or \"English Waltz\" depending on locality\n\nTango:\n32 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nViennese Waltz:\n60 bars per minute, 3/4 time.\nOn the European continent, the Viennese waltz is known simply as \"waltz\", while the waltz is recognized as \"English waltz\" or \"Slow Waltz\".\n\nFoxtrot:\n28 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nQuickstep:\n50 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nCha-cha-cha:\n30 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nSamba:\n48 bars per minute, 2/4 time\n\nRumba:\n24 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nPaso Doble:\n56 bars per minute, 2/4 time\n\nJive:\n42 bars per minute, 4/4 time\n\nWaltz:\n28–30 bars per minute\n30–32 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nTango:\n30 bars per minute\n30–32 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nFoxtrot:\n30 bars per minute\n32–34 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nViennese Waltz:\n53–54 bars per minute\n54 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nCha Cha:\n30 bars per minute\n\nRumba:\n30–32 bars per minute\n32–36 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nEast Coast Swing:\n36 bars per minute\n34–36 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nBolero:\n24 bars per minute\n24–26 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nMambo:\n47 bars per minute\n48–51 bars per minute for Bronze\n\nHistorical/Vintage Ballroom dance:\n\nOther dances occasionally categorized as ballroom:\n\n\n·Nott, James, Going to the Palais: a social and cultural history of dancing and dance halls in Britain, 1918-60 - Published 2015 OUP \nhttps://global.oup.com/academic/product/going-to-the-palais-9780199605194?cc=gb&lang=en&\n\n"}
{"id": "1962480", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1962480", "title": "BotCon", "text": "BotCon\n\nBotCon, briefly known as \"The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention\" (or OTFCC), was an annual convention for Transformers fans and collectors. BotCon has been held annually since 1994. BotCon is a syllabic abbreviation for \"Robot Convention\" but also refers to \"Autobot\" and \"Decepticon\", the protagonist and antagonist robot factions in the many continuities in the Transformers franchise.\n\nFeatured BotCon guests are usually involved in the creation of Transformers media in some respect, whether as voice actors from the animated series, artists or writers from the comic books, or actual Hasbro employees. Fun Publications has held the convention for a number of years, with 2016 being the final year it would do so. It was replaced by HASCON, Hasbro's own convention in 2017.\n\nThe first BotCon was held in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1994. Organized by brothers Jon and Karl Hartman, the convention had 180 attendees. BotCon was organized in 1995 by Raksha, a prominent figure in the fan community, and in 1996 by Men In Black Productions, headed up by Dennis Barger. In 1997, the Hartmans brought Glen Hallit, a fellow fan, into the fold, forming 3H Enterprises (based upon the first letter of all three organizers' last names).\n\nIn 1999, BotCon Europe took place in Clapham Common, Wandsworth, South West London.\n\nAt BotCon 2002, Hallit announced that 3H had secured the official Transformers convention license, as well as licenses to produce comic books and start a fan club. Shortly thereafter, the Hartmans were removed from their organizational duties, leaving Glen Hallit as the sole organizer of the new company, 3H Productions, Inc.\n\nIn the winter of 2002, 3H sought to expand to Europe, holding an official European convention in Cheshunt, UK. Unfortunately, the event, which was held in conjunction with the main BotCon 2002 in the USA, had much less advertising and the registration did not open until a couple of weeks before the convention. Since the attendance at the European BotCon had been much smaller than the main show that summer, 3H decided it was too much work to hold two separate conventions, and officially announced that they would never hold BotCon outside the USA again.\n\nIn 2003, the convention changed its name to \"The Official Transformers Collectors' Convention\", OTFCC for short, due to the Hartmans' ownership of the BotCon service mark. The fandom held dueling conventions in 2004, as 3H held OTFCC in Chicago, Illinois, while the Hartman brothers revived the BotCon name for their final convention in Pasadena, California. In the fall of that year, 3H Productions lost all of its Transformers-related licenses, leaving the convention in a state of limbo.\n\nIn early January 2005, Hasbro announced on its official Web site that Fun Publications, owned by Brian Savage, had been awarded the convention and fan club licenses. The Hartman brothers and other prominent fans Pete Sinclair, Benson Yee, and Rik Alvarez were invited to form an advisory council to help ease the transition of organizing the convention for the new owners. Once the Hartmans' service mark was transferred to Fun Publications, BotCon regained its status of being the official Transformers collectors' convention.\n\n\nOver the years, BotCon has featured many individuals who have worked to bring the Transformers multiverse to life, including voice actors, animation staff, and Hasbro design team members. BotCon guests include:\n\nAt the 2010 BotCon, Hasbro introduced a \"Hall of Fame\" awards ceremony to commemorate the people and characters of the franchise. Hasbro selected the first four robot inductees, while fans worldwide voted for the fifth. In the end, Dinobot from \"\" won the votes. Among the human inductees were Bob Budiansky for helping create the franchise through comics and personality profiles, Peter Cullen for giving Optimus Prime his voice, Hideaki Yoke and Kohjin Ohno of Takara Tomy for creating many of the franchise's toys.\n\nFor 2011, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay were inducted for the success of the \"Transformers\" live-action film franchise.\n\nIn 2012, the first posthumous award was given to voice actor Chris Latta, who died in 1994. Wheeljack, one of the characters he voiced in the original series, was selected as the Fan's Choice recipient.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of BotCon's most popular features is the exclusive toys made available to the attendees. The toys are different every year and are not retailed anywhere in the world. The number of exclusive toys increased significantly in 2005 after Fun Publications became the official license holder of the convention. The identities and designs of the toys were originally kept a close secret until the opening of the convention, but in the later years of the convention the organizers often chose to reveal one or more of the exclusives ahead of time due to repeated problems with stolen prototypes being sold on eBay. In 2008, organizer Brian Savage ordered all eBay users selling these prototypes to return them to their rightful owners.\n\nAlthough the toys are always unique, financial costs prohibit the creation of entirely new molds. As such, the toys are redecos, repaints, or retools of previously used toys given new identities, occasionally switching allegiances and even gender. Beginning in 2003, some of the exclusives were given new, retooled heads to further differentiate the new characters from previous uses of a mold. As the number of exclusives offered at each convention grew, so did the number of retooled parts. Since then, it has been standard practice to produce 3-4 newly tooled heads (or other parts such as wings in the case of 2007) for each BotCon. After the convention, exclusive toys usually become valuable collector's items in the community, particularly among fans who missed the convention.\n\nThe Transformers Collector's Club also releases exclusive figures, which are also remolds and repaints of regular \"Transformers\" figures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevolving around the storyline \"Dawn of Predacus,\" these toys celebrate the 20th Anniversary of \"Beast Wars\".\n\n\n\nVarious toys for Botcon and the Transformers Collector's Club have been considered but gone unproduced, including the following:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2906200", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2906200", "title": "Bridal shower", "text": "Bridal shower\n\nA bridal shower is a gift-giving party held for a bride-to-be in anticipation of her wedding. The custom originated in the 1890s and is today most common in the United States, Canada and in India\n\nThe history of the custom is rooted not necessarily for the provision of goods for the upcoming matrimonial home, but to provide goods and financial assistance to ensure the wedding may take place.\n\nThe custom of the bridal shower is said to have grown out of earlier dowry practices, when a poor woman's family might not have the money to provide a dowry for her, or when a father refused to give his daughter her dowry because he did not approve of the marriage. In such situations, friends of the woman would gather together and bring gifts that would compensate for the dowry and allow her to marry the man of her choice.\n\nThe earliest stories about these events have been known to originate in Brussels, Belgium around 1860. A frequently quoted legend traces the origin of this practice to the 16th or 17th Century Netherlands. However, there are also parallels with many dowry practices and the United States colonial or hope chest (\"trousseau\") custom.\n\nA related custom practised in medieval England was the Bride Ale: in Langland's \"Piers Plowman\" (§ B.II.45) there is a reference to a \"bruydale.\" This was a feast held before the wedding day, at which the bride made beer and sold it to the guests at a high price.\n\nIn the United States, bridal showers started in urban areas in the 1890s mainly among the upper middle classes. By the 1930s, bridal showers had spread to rural America.\n\nThe earliest use of this sense of the word in print may be in the Grand Rapids \"Michigan Evening Press\" 22 June 4, 1904: \"The ‘shower parties’ that through mistaken hospitality the wedded couple are forced to attend ...\" and may derive from the custom in Victorian times for the presents to be put inside a parasol, which when opened would \"shower\" the bride-to-be with gifts.\n\nMany different customs have developed in different regions and social groups, but the basic format has been relatively unchanged for generations, and emphasizes traditional gender roles. Sociologists like Beth Montemurro write that the ritual of the bridal shower \"socializes women into the hyper-feminized traditional wife role,\" with its emphasis on the future role of the bride-to-be as family cook, homemaker, and sexual partner. Historian Elizabeth Pleck echoes this dynamic in pointing out that traditional shower gifts were \"for the bedroom or the kitchen.\" But this role is more of an homage to the mothers and grandmothers than a reflection of how the bride-to-be will actually behave in the marriage.\n\nAlthough the format has remained relatively consistent, there have been some significant changes. An etiquette guide from the 1920s suggested showers should be \"purely spontaneous and informal,\" with guests arriving unannounced at the bride-to-be's home, while a planning guide from the 1950s suggests more complex themes and games.\n\nShowers are often held during the afternoon or evening, but not generally as luncheons or dinner parties. They commonly take place four to six weeks before the wedding.\n\nDue to the prior history of showers being \"purely spontaneous and informal\", showers have not developed the same formal etiquette that has developed with respect to weddings. Invitations may be issued informally, by mail, telephone, or e-mail.\n\nAs showers are explicitly a gift-giving occasion, everyone who attends the shower is expected to bring a small gift. People who decline the invitation for any reason are not expected to send a gift or otherwise participate in the party. The hosts are expected to hand over gifts, or favors. These can be small gifts like chocolate coins that have been personalized with the name of the bride and the date of the event or a simple thank-you message.\n\nFood can be served at bridal showers. Treats such as cake and candy buffets can also be served for guests.\n\nHosting the bridal shower falls to one or more close friends of the bride, often one or more of the bridesmaids. Mothers, sisters, and other close family members usually do not host bridal showers, as it may be seen as rude and greedy for the family to ask for gifts for their own members. Instead of a bridal shower, family members and future in-laws who wish to celebrate the upcoming wedding host a bridal tea, bridesmaids' luncheon, engagement announcement party, or other non-gift-oriented party. Some organizations, such as social clubs or religious groups, host bridal showers for every member who is being married.\n\nGuests are chosen from among the bride's personal friends, family, and other well-wishers. Men are not usually present at bridal showers.\n\nThe number of guests and their relationship to the bride varies widely. In Canada, among some immigrant communities parties in community halls with upwards of 300 guests were normal, while other cultures emphasized intimate parties with only close friends and relatives.\n\nIn general, people who are invited to a bridal shower are also invited to the wedding ceremony.\n\nThough many cultures have events before the wedding, bridal showers are most common in the United States and Canada. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, bridal showers have been described as a \"consumerist American idea\" with \"limited acceptability\". In the UK, wedding presents are normally selected from a list provided by the couple, and delivered either at the wedding or by the shop, and sometimes displayed at the wedding.\n\nIn India, Mehndi is a bridal-centric pre-wedding event where the bride's female friends and family gather to prepare the bride for the wedding. In the event the bride's traditional henna tattoos are made.\n\nIn Denmark, the only pre-wedding events commonly held is a bachelorette party for the bride and a bachelor party for the groom, both called polterabend.\n\n"}
{"id": "4799782", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4799782", "title": "Bruce campaign in Ireland", "text": "Bruce campaign in Ireland\n\nThe Bruce campaign was a three-year military campaign by Edward Bruce, brother of the Scottish king Robert the Bruce, in Ireland. It lasted from his landing at Larne in 1315 to his defeat and death in 1318 at the Battle of Faughart in County Louth.\n\nAfter his victory at the Battle of Bannockburn, Robert decided to expand his war against the English by sending an army under his younger brother Edward to invade Ireland. Another reason for the expedition was that supporters of the exiled House of Balliol had fled to Ireland after fighting at Bannockburn and remained a dangerous threat. These men were led by John MacDougall of Lorn, who was the cousin of John III Comyn, Lord of Badenoch, nephew of King John Balliol. The murder of Comyn in 1306 had set off a bloody civil war for the throne of Scotland which King Robert had all but won at Bannockburn and was now attempting to finish by capturing their last remaining stronghold. Robert was also invited by some of the native Irish to send an army to drive out the Norman settlers and in return they would crown his brother High King of Ireland. This campaign to revive the High Kingship effectively ended with Edward's defeat and death in the Battle of Faughart in 1318.\n\nBy the early 14th century, Ireland had not had a High King since Ruaidri mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (Rory O'Conor) who had been deposed by his son in 1186. Further, the Plantagenet dynasty had claimed a right to take control of Ireland by the papal document \"Laudabiliter\" in 1155 and indirectly ruled much of the eastern part of the island. The country was divided between the Gaelic dynasties that survived the Norman invasion and the Hiberno-Norman Lordship of Ireland.\n\nIn 1258 some of the Gaelic aristocrats elected Brian Ua Néill High King; however, he was defeated by the Normans at the Battle of Downpatrick in 1260.\n\nIn 1315 Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, sent his younger brother Edward Bruce to invade Ireland. Bruce's main mission in invading Ireland was to create a second front in the ongoing war against Norman England, draining her of much needed men, materials and finance by creating havoc on the island, as well as depriving her of the Irish tax revenues contributing to the war effort. This became critical when King Robert's control of the Isle of Man was lost to Norman-backed Scots in January 1315, thereby threatening the south and southwest of Scotland and also reopening up a potential source of aid to England from the Hiberno-Normans and Gaelic Irish.\n\nAdded to this was a request for aid from the King of Tír Eógain (Tyrone), Domnall mac Brian Ó Néill (Donall Ó Néill). Ó Néill had been troubled by Norman incursions to the southeast (the de Verdons), the east (tenants of the Earl of Ulster) and west (also by the Earl of Ulster) of Tír Eógain and to retain his lands, he and some twelve of his vassals and allies jointly asked for aid from Scotland. The Bruce brothers agreed, on condition that they would support Edward as King of Ireland, as the brothers envisaged themselves as separate rulers of Scotland and Ireland, while Robert would regain Man and Edward possibly make an attack on Wales, with Welsh support. They personally envisioned \"a grand Gaelic alliance against England\" between Scotland and Ireland, since both countries had a common heritage, language and culture.\n\nÓ Néill approved of the conditions for himself and on behalf of his vassals, and preparations began. At about this point, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March, received news from Irish sources that an invasion was about to take place, and made his way to Ireland where he held land, mainly in and around the castle and town of Trim. He had previously fought against the Bruces at Bannockburn where he was taken prisoner and freed to return King Edward II's royal seal, lost in the rout.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament met at Ayr on 26 April 1315, just across the North Channel from Antrim. As King Robert did not yet have a legitimate son, Edward was proclaimed his legal heir and successor as King of Scots and all other titles in case of his death. Edward's invasion fleet also mustered there, having received calls to assemble as far back as at least the previous month.\n\nOn 26 May 1315 Edward and his fleet (and more than 5,000 men) landed on the Irish coast at points at and between Olderfleet Castle at Larne, and Glendrum. His brother had sailed from Tarbert for the Western Isles with his son-in-law Walter Stewart, to subjugate them till \"all the isles, great and small, were brought to his will.\" Edward faced by an army led by vassals and confederates of the Earl of Ulster, the de Mandevilles, Bissets of the Glens, Logans, and Savages, as well as their Irish allies, overall led by Sir Thomas de Mandeville. However they were defeated in battle by the Scots under Thomas Randolph, Earl of Moray. Subsequently, the Scots managed to take the town, though not the castle, of Carrickfergus.\n\nIn early June, Donall Ó Néill of Tyrone and some twelve fellow northern Kings and lords met Edward Bruce at Carrickfergus and swore fealty to him as King of Ireland. The Irish annals state that Bruce \"took the hostages and lordship of the whole province of Ulster without opposition and they consented to him being proclaimed King of Ireland and all the Gaels of Ireland agreed to grant him lordship and they called him King of Ireland.\" At this point Bruce directly or indirectly ruled much of eastern and mid-Ulster.\n\nIn late June, Edward proceeded with his army from Carrickfergus along Magh Line (Six Mile Water), burning Rathmore, near Antrim town, which was a holding of the Savages. He then went south by way of the Moiry Pass – called \"\"Innermallan\"/\"Enderwillane\"/Imberdiolan\"\" in contemporary accounts – between Newry and Dundalk. This ancient routeway had been for centuries the passage south out of Ulster into the Kingdom of Mide, Leinster and Munster but because of its narrowness Ulster armies had frequently ambushed and been ambushed at the pass. Here he was met by Mac Duilechain of Clanbrassil and Mac Artain of Iveagh, both of whom had submitted to him at Carrickfergus. Their attempted ambush ended in their defeat and the army pressed on, destroying de Verdon's fortress of Castleroache, and on 29 June attacked Dundalk. The town, another possession of the de Verdon's, was almost totally destroyed with its population, both Anglo-Irish and Gaelic, massacred alike.\n\nIn July, two separate armies opposing Bruce met and assembled at Sliabh Breagh, south of Ardee. One was led out of Connacht by Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster and his ally, the King of Connacht, Felim mac Aedh Ua Conchobair. The second consisted of forces raised in Munster and Leinster by the Justicier Edmund Butler. The Scots-Irish army was located at Inniskeen, ten miles north. In between Sliabh Breagh and Inniskeen was the village of Louth. De Burgh moved his army north of Louth and set up camp while his cousin, William Liath de Burgh attempted to ambush Bruce's forces. While some skirmishing did result in a number of Scots deaths, Bruce refused to give battle and instead, with the Ó Néill, retreated northwards to Coleraine via Armagh. Bruce and Ó Néill sacked and burned Coleraine, threw down the bridge over the river Bann and faced off de Burgh's pursuing army on the opposite bank. While both sides now were experiencing shortages of food and supplies, Bruce and Ó Néill could at least draw support from local lords such as Ó Cathain and Ó Floinn. Mindful of this, de Burgh eventually withdrew back forty miles to Antrim, while Butler had to return to Ormond due to lack of supplies.\n\nIn addition to this, Bruce sent separate messages both to King Felim and a rival dynast, Cathal Ua Conchobair, promising to support them if they withdrew. Cathal managed to return to Connacht and had himself proclaimed king, leaving Felim with no choice but to return to put down his rebellion. Worst was to follow: De Burgh found himself deprived of not two but three allies and their armies when his kinsman, Walter mac Walter Cattach Burke deserted back to Connacht at the head of several hundred men, probably to guard his own estates from the upcoming conflict. Thus when in August Bruce and his men crossed the Bann (in four ships supplied by Scots sea captain, Thomas Dun), de Burgh retreated still further to Connor, where on either the first or ninth of September a charge by the Scots-Irish led to his defeat. William Liath was captured and taken as hostage to Scotland by Moray who arrived there on 15 September 1315 to raise more troops, \"his ships filled with booty.\" De Burgh retreated back to Connacht, while other Anglo-Irish took refuge in Carrickfergus Castle.\n\nFinally apprised of the seriousness of the situation, Edward II had on 1 September ordered an assembly of the leading Anglo-Irish, which met at Parliament in Dublin in late October, but no decisive action was taken. On 13 November, Bruce marched further south via Dundalk – where, incredibly, \"some gave them the right hand\", i.e., a fight – garrisoned Nobber on the 30th, and advanced to Kells, where he was met by Mortimer. Mortimer had managed to raise a large force consisting both of his Anglo-Irish and Gaelic vassals, in addition to forces of other magnates. At the same time, Bruce was reinforced by Moray who had returned from Scotland with around five hundred fresh troops and supplies. The Battle of Kells was fought on the sixth or seventh of November, with Mortimer being decisively defeated by Bruce. Mortimer was forced to retreat to Dublin while his lieutenant, Walter Cusack, held out at Trim. He almost immediately set sail for England to urge Edward II for reinforcements. At the same time, Governor of Ireland (and Bishop of Ely) John de Hothum began to take drastic action to defend Dublin from Bruce, such as levelling entire tenements and churches to use the stones to reinforce their walls.\n\nAfter sacking and burning Kells, Bruce proceeded to do the same to Granard, Finnea, the Cistercian monastery of Abbeylara and raided Angaile (), the lordship of Gaelic lord O Hanely. Bruce spent Christmas at de Verdon's manor of Loughsewdy, consuming its supplies entirely and before leaving, razing it to the ground. The only manors left alone belonged to Irish lords intimidated to join him, or that of a junior branch of the de Lacy family who in an effort to gain lands voluntarily joined him.\n\nIn 1317 Edward's Irish allies sent a remonstrance to Pope John XXII asking him to revoke \"Laudabiliter\" and mentioning Edward as King of Ireland. Pope John ignored the request.\n\nAfter several years of mobile warfare, Bruce and his allies failed to hold areas that they had conquered. His army fed itself by pillaging, which caused increasing unpopularity. The pan-European Great Famine of 1315–1317 affected Ireland also, and disease became widespread in his army, causing it to shrink, and he was defeated and killed at the end of 1318 at the Battle of Faughart in County Louth.\n\nThis campaign has sometimes been dealt with briefly or not at all in accounts of the Wars of Scottish Independence, but there are a few exceptions.\n\nThe campaign is described in books 14 to 16 of Barbour's epic poem \"The Brus\", written within living memory of the events it describe.\n\nIn Nigel Tranter's novel \"The Price of the King's Peace\", the third part of his Robert the Bruce trilogy, the campaign, and particularly Robert's visit to Ireland to support his brother, are described at significant length. Edward Bruce is shown as out of his depth during his invasion of Ireland, there may be some truth in this, although the novel could exaggerate his lack of competence and differences between the two brothers.\n\nThe invasion of 1315 also forms the backdrop of a series of novels by Tim Hodkinson, \"Lions of the Grail\" and \"The Waste Land\"\n\n\n"}

The British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale.\nNews reports described the incident as the biggest of its kind in peacetime Europe and certainly the biggest such explosion in the United Kingdom since the 1974 Flixborough disaster.

The primary need is for safety measures to be in place to prevent fuel escaping the tanks in which it is stored. Added safety measures are needed for when fuel does escape, mainly to prevent it forming a flammable vapour and stop pollutants from poisoning the environment.\n\nThe first and largest explosion occurred at 06:01 UTC on Sunday, 11 December 2005 near container 912. Further explosions followed which eventually overwhelmed 20 large storage tanks.\nFrom all accounts, it seems to have been an unconfined vapour cloud explosion of unusually high strengthalso known as a fuel-air explosion. Because of an inversion layer, the explosions were heard up to away; there were reports that they were audible in Belgium, France, and the Netherlands.\n\nThe British Geological Survey monitored the event, which measured 2.4 on the Richter scale. It was reported that people were woken in south London, and as far west as Wokingham (about ), where in its southern suburb, Finchampstead, numerous people felt the shockwave after the initial explosion. Subsequent explosions occurred at 06:27 and 06:28.\n\nWitnesses many miles from the terminal observed flames hundreds of feet high; the smoke cloud was visible from space, and from as far north as Lincolnshire (about ) away. Damage from the blasts included broken windows at various buildings including the Holy Trinity church and Leverstock Green School, blown-in or warped front doors, and an entire wall being removed from a warehouse more than half a mile (800 m) from the site. Buildings in neighbouring St Albans also suffered; Townsend School had serious blast damage, and a window was blown out of St Albans Abbey (about away).\n\nSeveral nearby office blocks were hit so badly that almost every window, front and back, was blown in as the explosion ripped through them. The timing of the explosion before work hours possibly prevented additional casualties. Reports also indicated that cars in nearby streets caught fire. The roof of at least one house was blown off. Buildings in the vicinity were evacuated by police, not only because of the smoke and possibility of more explosions, but because of the danger of structural damage making the buildings unstable.\n\nThere were 43 reported injuries; two people were deemed to be seriously injured enough to be kept in hospital, one in Watford General Hospital, with breathing difficulties, and another in Hemel Hempstead Hospital, although they were not in a life-threatening condition. Some early media reports spoke of eight fatalities, but these may have been persons missing. All members of staff from the terminal were accounted for.\n\nHertfordshire police and fire services and the member of parliament for the area, Mike Penning, said that there were seven fuel tanks on the site which, as of 14:00 on 12 December, had not been affected. These tanks were at risk of exploding if the fire were to spread.\n\nThe emergency services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a tremendous fire fighting effort began. At peak times this effort consisted of 25 fire engines, 20 support vehicles and 180 fire fighters. \n\nAround 150 firefighters were called immediately to the incident, and began tackling the blaze at 08:20 on the morning of 11 December, putting in containment measures before applying a large quantity of foam. The incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway, which led to its closure and the setting up of a public exclusion area. It was estimated that this incident would be the largest \"single-seat\" fire in the world ever to be fought by a fire brigade, and foam supplies from sites all over the UK were drawn upon.\n\nPlans had been in place to start using foam at midnight on 11 December, but were delayed by last-minute concerns over possible pollution of local rivers and underlying water sources. Six high volume pumps were used to extract of water per minute per secondfrom a reservoir from the fire, with six more high volume pumps deployed at various locations to serve as boosters. Thirty-two thousand litres (7,039 imp gal) of fire fighting foam per minute were directed against the fire for just over four hours, after which the pumping rate was reduced. Half of the 20 individual fires were reported extinguished by midday.\n\nBy 16:30 on Monday 12 December, it was reported that a further two tank fires had been extinguished, but that one of the tanks extinguished earlier had ruptured and re-ignited, and was now threatening to cause the explosion of an adjacent tank. This led to the M1 motorway being closed again; the public exclusion area was widened, and firefighters were temporarily withdrawn until the risk posed by the threatened tank could be assessed.\n\nFirefighting operations were resumed at about 20:00, and it was anticipated that all fires could be extinguished during the night. Further damage occurred to one of the storage tanks in the early hours of Tuesday morning, causing firefighters to be withdrawn once again, but operations resumed at 08:30. By midday on 13 December, all but three fires had been extinguished, although the largest tank was still burning. Bronze commandoperations on the groundwas visited by the Bishop of St Albans, the local vicar, and the industrial chaplain supporting the fire crews, to see how they were coping.\n\nFirefighters were confident that the remaining fires could be extinguished during the day on Tuesday, 13 December. The smoke plume had been considerably reduced and was more grey, indicating the amount of vapourised water now combining with the smoke. It was reported at 16:45 that all tank fires had been extinguished, although some smaller fires persisted. 75% of firefighters for Hertfordshire were involved in fighting the fire, supported by 16 other brigades. The entire gold command operation, involving many agencies as well as all the emergency services, was run from Hertfordshire Constabulary's headquarters in Welwyn Garden City, some distance from the fire.\n\nA further fire broke out during the early morning of 14 December. Firefighters were of the view that extinguishing it would leave the risk of petroleum vapour re-igniting or exploding, so it would be better to allow the fire, which was well contained, to burn itself out. Hertfordshire Fire Service's deputy chief Mark Yates stated that escaping petroleum vapour was the most likely cause of the original explosion and fire.\n\nThe black smoke cloud, which was visible from satellite photographs, drifted at a high altitude, around , towards Reading and Swindon, and could be seen across much of South East England.\n\nThe small particles in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued warnings that the smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.\n\nThe fire resulted in 244 people requiring medical aidmainly on the first day of the fire. From those 117 had symptoms attributable to the incident, of whom 38 were members of the public. The majority of those visiting hospitals were from the rescue services and attended for precautionary check ups. Most of them had no symptoms, except for 63 emergency workers who suffered respiratory complaints, of which half were sore throats.\n\nFor the first two days of the fire, the high thermal energy made the plume highly buoyant; this, together with settled weather conditions, allowed the plume to rise to a great height with little cross-mixing. When the fire was reduced in intensity it was reported to be possible that the plume would be less buoyant and that ground-level smoke concentrations could then rise significantly. By 12 December, it was reported that the smoke cloud had reached northern France; it was expected to arrive in northern Spain by the weekend.\n\nTo investigate the smoke cloud the Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements, a research aircraft operated jointly by NERC and the Met Office, made two flights on 12 and 13 December. In the first flight the edge of the plume was followed along the south coast of England. Carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and ozone concentrations were found to be low with soot particles being the major component in the cloud. The second flight went into the centre of the plume to obtain data to help forecasting and emergency teams.\n\nHundreds of homes in the Hemel Hempstead area were evacuated, and about 2,000 people had to find alternative accommodation; emergency services asked residents of the smoke-affected areas to close their windows and doors and to stay inside.\n\nHertfordshire Constabulary advised people who had houses with smashed windows to seek refuge with friends or family nearby if possible. Some people whose homes were damaged by the blast were placed in hotels, while others stayed in a nearby shopping centre. Total, the operator of the Buncefield depot, set up a helpline for people whose properties had been damaged by the explosion, and called in local authorities and the Salvation Army to provide accommodation or other help.\n\nConcerns for public safety resulted in about 227 schools, libraries, and other public buildings across Hertfordshire and Buckinghamshire closing on 12 and 13 December. Police and local authorities advised residents to consult the \"Hertfordshire Direct\" website for up-to-date information.\n\nSeventy-eight schools in Luton borough were closed on 13 December, along with a limited number of schools in Bedfordshire, on the advice of Hertfordshire's Health Protection Agency that all schools within a radius of the incident site should be closed because of concerns surrounding the effect of the smoke plume on children's health. Schools reopened as normal on 14 December.\n\nThe incident occurred close to junction 8 of the M1 motorway. The motorway was shut between junctions 12 and 6aabout shortly after the incident. Other roads in the vicinity, including the short M10 motorway (now part of the A414 road), were also closed.\n\nSome local petrol stations reported long queues as people started panic buying. A spokesman for the Department of Trade and Industry gave assurances that no petrol shortage was likely to result from the incident.\n\nThe oil terminal supplied 30% of Heathrow Airport's fuel, and because of the fire, the airport had to start rationing fuel. Some long-haul flights to Australia, the Far East, and South Africa had to make an intermediate stop at Stansted Airport or other European airports to refuel, while short-haul operators were asked to fuel their aircraft for the round trip before flying to Heathrow. Some aircraft were only allowed 40% of the fuel they would normally take on board. Fuel shortages continued for months after the explosion.\n\nIn the Maylands industrial area the worst affected buildings were the Northgate Information Solutions headquarters and the Fujifilm building. These buildings were so badly damaged they were rendered completely unusable. Demolition of the Fujifilm building began soon afterwards, and by June 2006 it had been completely removed from the site. Although the Northgate and Fujifilm buildings were closest to the blast, the surrounding Catherine House (to the north), Keystone Distribution building (to the west), 3Com Corporation and RO buildings (to the south), were also extensively damaged. In all, six buildings were designated for demolition and 30 more required major repairs before they could be reoccupied.\n\nAs a result of the destruction of the equipment in the Northgate building several websites hosted there were inaccessibleincluding that of the Labour Party. Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge was also affected; its IT system dealing with admissions and discharges had to be replaced for several days by a manual system.\n\nA number of companies were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the depot had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the depot.\n\nIn May 2006 Three Valleys Water announced that it had detected the persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic fluorosurfactant perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)which is used in fire fighting foamin a ground water bore hole close to the Buncefield site. It stated that no water from this well entered the public water supply and that a nearby well and pumping station had been closed since the fire as a precaution. The chemical is a known health risk and the UK government had been about to ban its use.\n\nHowever just before the announcement, the Drinking Water Inspectorate announced that it was increasing the safe level of the chemical in drinking water. Hemel Hempstead MP, Mike Penning accused the government of changing the rules to suit the situation in which PFOS levels in drinking water in the area may rise in the future. Most of the fuel burned outrather than spilling into the soil, so the impact on surrounding land and the water table was limited.\n\nA government inquiry held jointly by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the Environment Agency was started, but calls for a full public inquiry were declined. The Board included Tony Newton, Baron Newton of Braintree; Prof Dougal Drysdale, an authority on fire safety; and Dr Peter Baxter, a medical expert. Environment Agency and HSE staff were also on the board. Its aim was to identify the immediate causes of the explosion, rather than consider who was to blame for any deficiencies, so as not to prejudice further legal proceedings.\n\nAn initial progress report by the Major Incident Investigation Board on 21 February 2006 did not go into the causes of the explosion, but summed up the event and the immediate reaction from the emergency services. A second progress report, published on 11 April 2006, looked at the environmental impact.\n\nA further announcement was made on 9 May 2006 about the sequence of events which caused the explosion. Starting at 19:00 on the evening of 10 December 2005, Tank 912, towards the north west of the main depot, was filled with unleaded petrolfrom the Coryton Refinery located in Essex, England. At midnight the terminal closed, and a check was made of the contents of tanks, which found everything normal. Normally the gauges monitor the level of the fuel in the tank as it fills from the particular pipeline. From about 03:00 the level gauge for Tank 912 began to indicate an unchanging level reading, despite it being filled at per hour.\n\nCalculations show that the tank would have begun to overflow at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300 tonnes of petrol would have spilled down the side of the tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.\n\nAn overflow such as this results in the rapid formation of a rich fuel and air vapour. CCTV footage showed such a vapour flowing out the bund wall from around 05:38. By 05:50 the vapour started flowing off the site, near the junction of Cherry Tree and Buncefield Lane. Around 05:50 the rate at which fuel was being pumped into the tank increased dramatically. Initially the fuel was pumped in at per hour, but it increased to about per hour. By 06:01, when the first explosion occurred, the cloud which was initially about deep, thickened to and had spread beyond the boundaries of the site.\n\nThe extent of the damage meant it was not possible to determine the exact source of ignition, but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.\n\nA total of 2,700 claims were filed by residents, businesses and insurers. A group of 146 claimants were hoping to bring a class action against Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd. On 17 March 2006 a High Court official, Senior Master Turner, adjourned a hearing on whether to permit the class action until October 2006. Claimants including insurance companies, small businesses and about 280 families whose properties were damaged or destroyed were claiming up to £1 billion in damages.\n\nSeveral court cases resulted from the explosion, although the main trial to determine who was liable for the damage commenced at the High Court in October 2008. The BBC quoted Cheetah Courierswhich suffered a 20% drop in turnover because of the explosions, resulting in losses of around £300,000 to £400,000. The company was located in offices on an industrial estate from the depot.\n\nAn initial trial concluded on 23 May 2008 when Mr Justice David Steel issued a summary judgment after hearing that both Total and Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd (HOSL) had agreed that negligence was the cause. In the main trial, Total UK claimed that the duty supervisor at the time was responsible for the explosion, but refused to admit either civil or criminal liability for the incident. Total UK argued that it should not be liable for damages because it could not reasonably have foreseen that it would cause the destruction it did. On 20 March 2009 the High Court found Total liable for the blast, saying that it was satisfied that Total had control of tank filling operations at the Buncefield depot. The judgement left the company facing damage claims of around £700 million.\n\nTotal appealed the judgement, but the appeal was dismissed in a hearing on 4 March 2010.\n\nThe site is covered by the COMAH regulations. The Control of Major Accidents and Hazards Regulations are jointly enforced by the \"competent authority\" which is formed of the Environment Agency and the Health and Safety Executive. They carried out an investigation during and following the fire.\n\nIn April 2010 the five companies accused of causing the explosion faced a criminal prosecution brought by the Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency. Two defendants, Total UK and British Pipeline Agency Limited, had already pleaded guilty to offences under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The remaining three, Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd, TAV Engineering Ltd, and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty in June 2010. TAV Engineering Ltd and Motherwell Control Systems were found guilty of failing to protect their employees. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd was found guilty of failing to prevent major accidents and limit their effects and then pleaded guilty to causing pollution to enter controlled waters underlying the vicinity around the site, contrary to the Water Resources Act.\n\nSentencing took place in July 2010. Total UK was fined £3.6m, plus £2.6m in costs. Hertfordshire Oil Storage Limited was fined £1.45m and £1m in costs. The British Pipeline Agency was fined £300,000 plus £480,000 costs. Motherwell Control Systems and TAV Engineering were fined £1,000 each. Local MP Mike Penning called the modest fines \"insulting\".\n\nThe Hertfordshire Oil Storage Terminal (HOSLHertfordshire Oil Storage Ltd), generally known as the Buncefield complex, was the fifth largest oil-products storage depot in the UK, with a capacity of about of fuel, although it was not always full. This was about 8% of UK oil storage capacity.\n\nThe HOSL is a major hub on the UK's oil pipeline network (UKOP) with pipelines to Humberside and Stanlow Refinery and is an important fuel source to the British aviation industry, providing aircraft fuel for local airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports. About half of the complex is dedicated to the storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, petrol and diesel fuel for petrol stations across much of the South-East of England. The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco 40%.\n\nThe seat of the fire, and the worst damaged section, was \"HOSL West\", used by Total and Texaco to store a variety of fuels, and the neighbouring British Pipeline Agency area.\n\nThe final report of the Major Incident Investigation Board (MIIB) was written in 2008 and released in February 2011. The investigation found that Tank 912 at the Buncefield oil storage depot was being filled with petrol. The tank had a level gauge that employees used to monitor the level manually, and an independent high-level switch which would shut off inflow if the level got above a certain setpoint. On Tank 912, the manual gauge was stuck and the independent shut-off switch was inoperative, meaning that the tank was being \"filled blind\" with petrol (i.e., being filled without a clear indication of the level). Eventually Tank 912 filled up completely, the petrol overflowed through vents at the top, and formed a vapour cloud near ground level, which ignited and exploded. The fires from the explosion then lasted for five days.\n\nThe investigation found that the level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, but it did not concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the petrol in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed petrol to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The investigation found secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.\n\nWider management failings were found by the investigation to have contributed to the explosion: management safety checks at the site were found to be deficient and not properly followed. Site staff did not have control over the flow rates and timing of two of the three inlet sources, meaning that they did not have enough information to properly manage the storage of incoming fuel. Further, overall throughput had increased, reducing wait times further and shifting the emphasis to process operations instead of process safety.\n\nSoon after the incident the Health Protection Agency was stripped of its remit to provide air quality data and it was passed on to the Environment Agency which forms part of the Major Accident Investigation Board.\n\nAn anniversary service was held in Holy Trinity Church Leverstock Green on Sunday, 10 December 2006, at which the Bishop of St Albans spoke, calling again for a full public inquiry, for assurances that the local hospital would maintain its accident and emergency department, and for the community to continue to build on good relationships formed because of the blast.\n\nTo rebuild the damaged parts of the site, the relevant approval from Dacorum Borough Council would be needed. The BP section of the site is a good way from the explosion and survived with very little damage, but it was inoperative as of 2009. BP is exploring plans for the future use of this part of the site, and has indicated a number of priorities, including the reopening of the fuel pipelines to Heathrow. It is considering using its section to store aviation fuel and as a distribution centre for motor fuel, but at a much-reduced level. In late 2009, Total UK submitted plans for the reconstruction of the oil depot. The reconstruction of the site has been taking place since March 2013.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17882276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17882276", "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2008 Summer Olympics", "text": "Concerns and controversies at the 2008 Summer Olympics\n\nA number of concerns and controversies surfaced before, during, and after the 2008 Summer Olympics, and which received major media coverage. Leading up to the Olympics, there were concerns about human rights in China, such that many high-profile individuals, such as politicians and celebrities, announced intentions to boycott the games to protest China's role in the Darfur conflict, and Myanmar, its stance towards Tibet, or other aspects of its human rights record. During the games in Beijing, the city was also under a high alert because of security concerns following civil unrest in Tibet and terrorist attacks by Xinjiang separatists. The levels of air pollution in Beijing also came under much scrutiny, due both to concerns about athletes' health and concerns that Beijing had failed to live up to promises it made during its Olympic bid. Foreign journalists at the games reportedly faced various restrictions to their work, limitations to internet access, and threats of physical violence. The gymnastics competition caused a major worldwide controversy during and after the games when some Chinese gymnasts were accused of being under the minimum age, but then cleared after an investigation. Other controversies surrounding the 2008 Summer Olympics included ticketing problems, displacement of Beijing residents due to construction and demolitions, and alleged persecution of individuals applying to protest.\n\nIn spite of the various controversies, International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said at the closing ceremony that they were \"truly exceptional Games\".\n\nIn April, non-Chinese in Beijing reported more regular checks of their identification and work permits, while travel agents in Hong Kong reported that multiple-entry business visas for the mainland, commonly used by non-Chinese businessmen who lack work visas, were no longer being issued, apparently in an attempt to prevent the entry of non-Chinese activists.\n\nIncreased security was put into place for the Olympics, and security personnel were trained to counter different terrorist attack scenarios. Anti-aircraft missiles were also installed over the Olympic stations in Beijing. \"The Times\" reported that China had mobilised 110,000 police and other security forces in Beijing itself, plus 1.4 million security volunteers and 300,000 surveillance volunteers. The security bill for Beijing alone was estimated in excess of £3 billion. Outside the capital, cities hosting Olympic events were patrolled by 34,000 troops, surface-to-air missiles guarded key sites, and 74 military aircraft, 48 helicopters, and 33 naval vessels were placed on high alert.\n\nHong Kong's \"South China Morning Post (SCMP)\" reported that bar owners in the Sanlitun district of Beijing were ordered by police officials not to serve \"black people or Mongolians\" as well as of two staff members that were ethnic Tibetan for the Olympics. \"Time magazine\"'s Liam Fitzpatrick stated that the report by the \"SCMP\" was \"unconfirmed\", and its information was from \"anonymous\" sources. Equally, \"The Washington Post\" interviewed several black bar patrons in Sanlitun, all of whom said they had not been denied service. China's official news agency Xinhua stated on 21 July the alleged \"bar policy\" was groundless and the city's public security departments, including Sanlitun police, never demanded any bar not serve customers from any region or country ahead of the games.\n\nThe Beijing government issued new mandates requiring police officers in the city to act more professionally, warning that violators would be reprimanded. By doing this, Beijing hoped to clean up its image in time for the games. The government circulated pamphlets urging officers to desist from using foul language, being arrogant, and hanging up on people who call to report crimes.\n\nA drive was also launched to improve incorrect English translations common on Chinese signage and labelling in readiness for the Olympics. Signs were placed around Beijing, instructing locals not to ask any non-Chinese personal questions for fear of causing discomfort to tourists and athletes.\n\nHong Kong Bishop John Tong Hon said of his acceptance to participate in the opening ceremony that “while the leaders of the six largest religions in Hong Kong were invited to Beijing, only in the case of the Catholic Church was an invitation not sent to the highest authority. I am embarrassed because our government ignored Cardinal Zen and invited me instead.” He expressed his desire that China's government would someday give “the same importance to greater religious and social freedom that it had in cleaning up Beijing's pollution in anticipation of the games,” nonetheless noting that “the Olympic Games [still showed] the progress of China”.\n\nOde to the Motherland, sometimes called \"the second national anthem\" of the PRC, was lipsynched by Lin Miaoke. The song actually broadcast was a recording of another girl, Yang Peiyi. Chen Qigang, the ceremony's chief musical director, claimed that this was because a senior Politburo member had commented that Lin's singing was not good enough, but preferred Lin's appearance to that of Yang. Sun Weide, the spokesman for the Beijing organising committee, said however that the decision to use both girls was made by the artistic director after consulting with broadcasters, who had recommended the change.\n\nOne part of the fireworks show, which displayed the 29 footprints that wandered into the Bird's Nest from outside the stadium, was simulated by computer animation to portray the real fireworks due to the hazy smog conditions and safety concerns with flying a helicopter near the display.\n\nA number of sportsmen were criticised for their behaviour at the games:\n\nPrior to the start of the Games, the Spain Men's and Women's Basketball teams featured in ads that appeared in the Spanish daily sports newspaper \"Diario Marca\". The athletes, dressed in uniform and assembled at a center court bearing a dragon logo, posed with their hands pulling back the skin on their eyes. \"The Guardian\" said: \"No one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in China and elsewhere.\" A spokesman for the Organization of Chinese Americans said that the photo was \"clearly racist, and not even in a jovial way\".\nPoint guard Jose Manuel Calderon said the team was responding to a request from the photographer, while teammate Pau Gasol said it was \"absurd\" people were calling the gesture racist.\nThe IOC said \"clearly it was inappropriate, we understand the team has apologised and absolutely meant no offence whatsoever\", and considered the matter closed.\n\nIn July 2008, the football clubs representing players taking part in the games, FC Schalke 04, SV Werder Bremen and FC Barcelona, made an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport to prevent their star players, namely Brazil's Rafinha and Diego and Argentina's Lionel Messi respectively, from playing at the Olympics.\n\nFIFA's rule states that it was mandatory to release all players aged 23 or under for the Olympics which was overturned on July 30, 2008, stating that \"The Olympic Football Tournament Beijing 2008 is not included in the Co-ordinated Match Calendar and there is no specific decision of the FIFA Executive Committee establishing the obligation for the clubs to release players under 23 for this tournament.\" This meant clubs were entitled to recall their players from the games if they wished.\n\nDespite the ruling, FIFA appealed to the club, Rafinha and Diego was released for the games under the provision that their salaries was paid for by the Brazilian Football Confederation. Despite resistance from his employer, Messi was eventually released for the games.\n\nFull CAS summary\n\nIn early 2008, Yang Yun, an artistic gymnast who won two bronze medals at the 2000 Summer Olympics, admitted on state-run television that she was 14 when she had competed. Consequently, there was frequent speculation that members of the Chinese women's gymnastics team were 14 years of age or under, violating the minimum age requirements of International Federation of Gymnastics (FIG), the governing body of the sport, that requires gymnasts to be 16. Younger gymnasts are lighter and more supple than adult gymnasts, and have also been said to be more fearless when performing difficult manoeuvres.\nThe New York Times claimed that official media and some official Web sites in China, including that of the State General Administration of Sport, listed Chinese gymnasts' details which indicated that He Kexin, Jiang Yuyuan and Yang Yilin may have been as young as 14. During the Olympics, media focused their attention on He, Yang, Jiang, and Deng. In response, Chinese officials claimed the discrepancies for He Kexin were caused by paperwork errors when the gymnast switched teams. Chinese authorities presented passport information to show that they were 16 years old as of 2008. Chinese coach Lu Shanzhen explained that Chinese competitors had for years all been small. \"It is not just this time. It is a question of race. European and American athletes are all powerful, very robust. But Chinese athletes... are by nature that small.\" Sportswriter E.M. Swift criticised the IOC for \"spend[ing] millions of dollars trying to ferret out drug cheats [while ignoring] allegations of institutionalized cheating\" by the Chinese government.\n\nOn 22 August 2008 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) instructed the FIG to investigate the allegations that He Kexin was under-age, and were asked to report back to the IOC later that day. The FIG accepted passport ages as valid proof and declared gymnasts eligible. On 23 August, further pressure led the FIG to request additional documentation on five of the six athletes on the Chinese team. IOC president Jacques Rogge said that FIG had demanded \"birth certificates and all the documents like family books, entries in schools and things like that.\" While the FIG investigation was in progress, the IOC indicated reshuffling of the medals was unlikely. Having been satisfied with the proof of age received from the Chinese Gymnastics Association, the FIG ended the investigation on 1 October 2008, concluding that He and her teammates were eligible to compete.\n\nIn a related story, Yang's teammate in 2000, Dong Fangxiao, was subsequently revealed to have lied about her age. She claimed to have been 17 in 2000, but worked as a technical official at the 2008 Games, and her certification gave a birthdate of 1986—which would have made her 14 years old in 2000. In 2010, the FIG erased Dong's scores, and the IOC stripped China of its team bronze for 2000.\n\nAs the host country, China's very high expectations put immense pressure upon athletes and coaches alike. Liu Xiang, the defending Olympic champion for the 110 meter hurdles, had pulled out of the heats with an injury. His victory in Athens four years ago was China's first gold medal in track and field, regarded by some as dispelling the widespread view that Chinese physiology was unsuitable for such a discipline. Hyped by the state and sponsors, with his fame and endorsements exceeding that of Yao Ming in China, Liu's withdrawal disappointed millions with some accusing him of being afraid to lose, while others suggested that excessive pressure may have worn him out. Liu's coach had been told by government officials that \"if Liu could not win a gold medal in Beijing, all of his previous achievements would become meaningless.\" Josef Capousek, a former rowing coach, was fired by China's sporting federation over a contract dispute. He had argued in favour of the objective declared in the German version, to \"aim\" to get a gold medal, and against the Chinese-language version which stated that his athletes \"must\" win the gold medal. He said \"nobody can guarantee a gold in any sport...but here, anything less than gold means nothing.\"\n\nThere has also been criticism of the Chinese government's training regime. Parents and children endure considerable personal sacrifices – young children often leave their families to endure long and tough training regimens in the state academies, where 250,000 children are enrolled. Critics also say that the sports schools focus on training at the expense of general education, leaving athletes unprepared to leave the sports system that has raised them. Yang Wenjun, a C-2 Canoeing champion at the Athens Olympics, told \"The New York Times\" that he was ill-equipped to go to college or start a business. He recounted officials' threats to withhold his retirement income if he quit before the Beijing Games, adding that it was \"not possible to survive without those benefits\". While Yang and his family have received numerous rewards for his achievement (including white collar jobs, stipends, performance bonuses, endorsements, and an apartment), he has not seen his parents in three years.\n\nOn the opposite side, for those athletes who do win Gold medals, the State offers a significant performance bonus. Cheng Fei, for example, could look forward to more than $150,000 in cash and bonuses for every Olympic Gold Medal she wins. Yang said his wins at the 2002 Asian Games netted him about [US]$28,600 in bonuses –more than the money his parents can earn in ten years.\n\nOut of 4,500 samples that were collected from participating athletes at the games, six athletes with positive specimens were ousted from the competition. Although the rate of positive findings was lower than at the 2004 Summer Olympics, doping experts expressed concern due to advances in doping technology. In July 2008, a BBC investigation reported that samples positive for erythropoietin were labelled as negative by WADA-approved laboratories. The IOC stated in October 2008 that it would begin retesting samples for CERA.\n\nIn April 2017, the Olympics has had the most (49 of 50) Olympic medals stripped for doping violations. Russia is the leading country with 14 medals stripped off.\n\nThe International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that China had 150 million migrant workers out of a total national working population of 764 million people at the end of 2006. More than 40 million of these migrant workers were employed in construction, an industry in which some 90 percent of the workforce was composed of migrants. 2008 Summer Olympics migrant workers routinely endured dangerous work environments and lacked any safety net, including medical and accident insurance. Problems of migrant workers included unpaid wages and high legal costs.\n\nCalls for sustained pressure and boycotts of the Olympics came from former French presidential candidate François Bayrou, Sudan scholar Eric Reeves and the editorial board of \"The Washington Post\". In February 2008, American film director Steven Spielberg announced he was stepping down from his role as an artistic advisor in protest of the Chinese government's refusal to pressure Sudan to stop the \"continuing human suffering\" in the Darfur region, urging it to do more to stop \"these crimes against humanity.\" European Parliament Vice-President Edward McMillan-Scott, called for a boycott of the Beijing games; and praised the Prince of Wales for not attending the Games. Additionally, 106 lawmakers in the United States circulated a letter calling for the US to boycott the Olympics because of China's support of the Sudanese regime and the forced relocation of 300,000 poor Chinese to make room for the games. US Senators John McCain and Barack Obama both claimed that they would have boycotted the ceremony if they were in the White House. Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, became the first EU head of government to announce a boycott and was soon joined by President Václav Klaus of the Czech Republic. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said she will not attend opening of the Beijing Olympics. The Geneva-based group Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions claimed that 1.5 million Beijing residents would be displaced from their homes for the construction of Olympics venues. Beijing's Olympic organising committee and China's Foreign Ministry stated that 15,000 residents from 6,037 households were displaced. Some sources said that as of May 2005, 300,000 residents were evicted in preparation for the games and that police in Beijing placed many people under arrest for protesting against the evictions. Protester Ye Guozhu, who attempted to draw public attention to alleged forced evictions in Beijing due to Olympics-related construction, was sentenced in December 2004 to a four-year prison term for \"picking quarrels and stirring up trouble\".\n\nThe British Olympic Association (BOA) required that British participants signed an agreement before leaving for China, promising not to comment on any \"politically sensitive issues.\" However, a BOA spokesman stated that the BOA's intention was not to censor athletes, but to reaffirm the IOC charter, which prohibits demonstration of political, religious or racial propaganda in any Olympic venues.\n\nIn general, attendance at the 2008 games was highly politicised, with as many as 80 political heads of state attending; several major political figures, however, considered boycotting the Games for political reasons. On 2 April 2008, the Japanese government announced that its royal family would not participate in the opening ceremony because of the international concern focused on the violent crackdown in Tibet. On 5 April, the newspaper \"Le Monde\" reported that French President Nicolas Sarkozy hoped that there would be an end to violence against Tibetans, the release of political prisoners, light to be shed on the events and the opening of dialogue with the Dalai Lama before the opening ceremony. \"The BBC\" wrote that while Sarkozy was opposed to a full boycott, he would \"not close the door to any possibility\" as far as his own attendance was concerned.\n\nOn 10 April 2008, China announced that it had foiled a plot against the games by Uyghur separatists in Xinjiang. According to the Chinese security ministry, separatists planned suicide bomb attacks on Chinese cities and kidnappings in Beijing to disrupt the Olympic Games. Uyghur activists claim that the Chinese fabricated these terror plots to prevent people in the region from voicing their grievances with the Han Chinese. On 25 April 2008, Interpol issued a warning that there was a real possibility that the Beijing Olympics would be targeted by terrorist groups.\n\nChina reported 35 arrests as part of a ten-day raid. On 4 August 2008, two attackers detonated hand grenades at a police post near Kashgar, killing 16 policemen.\n\nSome pro-Tibetan independence groups, such as Students for a Free Tibet, initiated a campaign against the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics to protest for Tibetan independence, It also objected to the use of the Tibetan antelope (chiru) as the Fuwa Yingying. The Tibetan People's Movement has also demanded representation of Tibet with its own national flag. American film actor Richard Gere, chairman of the International Campaign for Tibet called for a boycott to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. There were also plans by Tibetans in exile to hold their own version of the Olympics in May, at the headquarters of the exiled government.\n\nThe international journalist group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) advocated boycott to express concerns over violations of free speech and human rights in China. It hoped that international pressure could effect the release of prisoners of conscience and the upholding of promises made to the IOC regarding improvements in human rights.\n\nIn March 2008, Taiwan's president-elect Ma Ying-jeou threatened a Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee boycott \"if the situation in Tibet continues to worsen\". Masahisa Tsujitani, a Japanese craftsman who makes shots used by many Olympic athletes, announced 14 April he refuses to allow his wares to be used at the games to protest China's treatment of protesters in Tibet.\n\nDuring the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Greece on 24 March 2008, three Reporters Without Borders journalists breached a cordon of 1,000 police at the ancient Olympia stadium and interrupted the speech of Liu Qi, head of the Beijing Games committee. One protestor tried to snatch the microphone as another unrolled a black flag showing the Olympic rings as handcuffs.\n\nNearly 50 Tibetan exiles in India began a global torch relay 25 March 2008 with a symbolic \"Olympic\" flame that ended in Tibet on 8 August 2008, the day of the Summer Games' opening ceremonies in Beijing. Although the torch was heavily guarded by local police and Chinese security agents wearing blue track suits, protesters attempting to stop the relay or take the torch were a significant problem along the route.\n\nDisruption of the torch relay and foreign condemnation of China resulted in a backlash of nationalism and anti-foreigner sentiment in China. French goods and businesses were threatened with a reprisals for the assault on torch-bearers through Paris, France. French retailer Carrefour was boycotted, and there were flag burning protests outside some stores. Foreign media, particularly CNN, was severely criticised for its reporting of the Tibetan riots. The media reported that the attitudes of Han Chinese citizens towards non-Chinese and Chinese minorities in China noticeably worsened. In late April, Chinese Internet censors, who had previously permitted posts critical of non-Chinese, began blocking words such as \"Carrefour\", in what was seen as an attempt to calm tensions before the games.\n\nLiu Shaowu announced on 23 July that the Public Security Bureau would issue permits for protesting in protest zones during the Olympics. The three designated locations were Purple Bamboo Park, Temple of the Sun, and Beijing World Park. On 18 August it was reported that of 77 applications, 74 were withdrawn, two suspended and one vetoed.\n\nA number of protest applicants claim that they were wrongfully discouraged, rejected, or denied permits altogether. Some who applied for permits went missing or were detained. Others say they have decided against applying because they feared that the process was a means to collect information about dissenters.\n\n\nChina pledged in its Olympic bid that it would allow open media access during the games, but Human Rights Watch alleges that it had failed to do so. While some estimated 20,000 journalists had been assured unfettered Internet access by the IOC's Jacques Rogge, Sun Weide (孙伟德) of the Beijing Organizing Committee announced in late July that China would allow only \"convenient\" access – still blocking sites which reference controversial content. The IOC and broadcasters were uncertain as to whether the Beijing authorities would allow them to broadcast live from locations such as Tiananmen Square, fearing protests. In 2001, Beijing announced there would be complete freedom for the media to report in China. After lengthy discussions, broadcasters were permitted to broadcast between the hours of 6–10 am and 9–11 pm with prior permission; however, live interviews were banned at all times. Many broadcasters were unhappy with this decision as it would \"set a bad precedent in regards to press freedom\", and were pushing the authorities further on the issue.\n\nIn late July, US senator Sam Brownback alleged that foreign-owned hotels in China were ordered by the government to install equipment to monitor internet use by guests. Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang said that the security arrangements did not exceed \"what is normal internationally\".\n\nThe IOC also investigated complaints from the international media that the Internet at the Main Press Centre was slow and some websites remain blocked, which may disrupt reporting. This was seen when Amnesty International criticised the Chinese government for not delivering on its Olympic promises of human rights; however journalists could not access the website. Additionally, websites critical of the government, or relating to Tibet and Falun Gong remain blocked at the centre. Kevan Gosper from the IOC clarified that the 'open Internet' only refers to reporting directly on the games, and not other issues relating to China. Due to international pressure, a number of websites, notably BBC, Amnesty International, Reporters Without Borders, and Apple Daily were unblocked.\n\nWhen queueing for Olympic tickets descended into chaos, fighting erupted between police and ticket-buyers, including journalists from Hong Kong such as Cable TV Hong Kong, Hong Kong Oriental News, and the SCMP. Two Japanese journalists covering bomb attacks in Xinjiang and a British journalist covering a Tibetan independence protest in Beijing were 'roughed up' and detained, and the British journalist claimed that his equipment was damaged. Chinese authorities apologised for the incident involving the Japanese journalists, and registered concern from the British embassy and the IOC with the latter incident.\n\nOn 14 August, the IOC urged China to allow foreign reporters to report freely at the games. After the games had closed, the Foreign Correspondents Club of China (FCCC) issued a statement noting that there was \"welcome progress in terms of accessibility and the number of press conferences within the Olympic facilities\". However, the FCCC was \"alarmed at the use of violence, intimidation and harassment outside\". The club confirmed more than 30 cases of reporting interference since 25 July, and said it was checking \"at least 20 other reported incidents\".\n\nAccording to \"Business Week\", at least 50 Beijing human-rights activists were either arrested, put under house arrest, or banished from the capital during the Games. In January 2008, AIDS and human rights activist Hu Jia, who was already under house arrest, was taken into custody on 27 December 2007 for \"inciting subversion\". Hu had criticised China's hosting of the Olympics by comparing it to Nazi Germany hosting the Berlin Olympics. Ye Guozhu was serving a four-year sentence and was scheduled for release in 2008. On 26 July, his supposed release day, his family was sent an official police notice prolonging his detention. Amnesty International cited the police saying Ye \"would be kept in detention to keep him and his family out of trouble until the Olympics and Paralympics were over.\" The U.S. Embassy in Beijing expressed concern over human rights groups' reports that Zeng Jinyan, blogger-wife of Hu Jia, was taken from her home on 7 August; three days later, Hua Huiqi, a leader in Beijing's underground church, was taken by security agents while on his way to church.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Olympics, the government issued guidelines to the local media for their reporting during the Games: political issues not directly related to the games such as Tibetan independence and social unrest in Xinjiang were not to be reported on, as were food safety issues such as \"cancer-causing mineral water.\" As the scandal involving melamine contamination of milk broke in September 2008, some western media evoked suspicions that China's desire for a perfect games may have been a factor contributing towards the delayed recall of contaminated infant formula, which has affected 94,000 babies with kidney stones and killed at least 4 infants, although the Central government denied issuing this guidance. Hebei provincial vice-governor said his administration was only notified by Shijiazhuang on 8 September. The World Health Organization asked Beijing why it took so many months for the scandal to become public, and to establish whether failure was deliberate or due to ignorance.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Weng'an riot, which was incited by the rape and murder of a teenage girl, photographs as well as comments on the Guizhou protest in chatrooms and forums were quickly deleted by the mainland Internet censors. The government launched a campaign to defuse protest ahead of the Olympics to continue carrying out social harmony and stability. An \"Olympics Stability Drive\" was announced after the incident. Public security officials in Guizhou offered a total of 9,000 yuan (about $1,300 or £700 or €800) to the parents of the teenage girl, with 3,000 paid by each suspect. The father said “We will never accept an evil deal like this, we need to seek justice for our daughter.”\n\nThe United States Olympic Committee imported food for American athletes, citing concerns regarding the safety of food products produced in China. In particular, athletes were concerned that eating meat that was raised in China could contain enough steroids to cause the athletes to test positive for steroid use. Several Canadian athletes received permission to do the same. The United States Olympic Committee's plan to bring its own food to China disappointed the leader of food services for the Beijing Olympics.\n\nConcern was raised over the air quality, and its potential effect on the athletes. Although the Beijing Municipal Government, in its bid file in 2001, committed to lowering air pollution, increasing environmental protection, and introducing environmental technology, research data show that even if the city were to dramatically cut down its emissions, pollution would still drift over from neighbouring provinces, upstream from which 50 percent of Beijing's air was believed to flow. Air pollution was at least two to three times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organization. Marco Cardinale of the British Olympic Association has stated that air pollution coupled with heat and humidity makes it \"very unlikely we'll see outstanding performances in endurance sports.\" Despite this, Beijing committed to remove 60,000 taxis and buses from the roads by the end of 2007 and relocate 200 local factories, including a prominent steel factory, before the games began. The Chinese government provided assurances that \"blue skies are a requirement not only for Beijing, but also for the places around it.\" The United States Olympic Committee was confident that the air quality of Beijing would not be a concern for the US delegation to the games. Nevertheless, the IOC's medical commission analysed air-quality data recorded by the Beijing Environment Protection Bureau in August, when test athletic events were held in the Chinese capital. The commission found that outdoor endurance events—defined as those that include at least an hour of continuous, high-intensity physical effort—may pose some risk.\n\nIn spite of such efforts, several countries indicated that their athletes would arrive at the games as late as possible to limit exposure to pollution. Many teams set up offshore training camps in neighbouring countries to avoid the pollution. The pollution prompted several athletes to change events or opt out: for example, Ethiopian long-distance runner Haile Gebrselassie withdrew from the marathon and ran the 10,000 meters instead, to reduce the risk of harm to himself because of his asthma, and Belgian tennis player Justine Henin announced nearly a year before the games that she would not compete for the same reasons.\n\nIn July 2008, stricter emergency pollution controls were introduced, including suspending production at more factories and coal-fired power plants, lowering the number of cars on the road and expanding driving restrictions to nearby Tianjin. In early July, Beijing ordered 40 factories in Tianjin and 300 factories in Tangshan to begin suspending operations in an effort to reduce air pollution. On 20 July, a major temporary air pollution control plan began: additional factories were shut down; there were license plate restrictions which allowed Beijing motorists to drive on alternate days only, depending on whether the last number on their license plate was odd or even, to reduce daily traffic by two million vehicles. Despite the program, by 28 July the \"China Daily\" reported that Beijing's skies remained alarmingly polluted and that authorities were considering emergency measures during the Games.\n\nAs the Games began, air quality in Beijing improved significantly against prior expectations. Air quality throughout the Games recorded API scores under 100, the official target. Of the 16 days of the Games, ten days recorded 'Grade I' and six days recorded 'Grade II' air quality in Chinese standards. Media concerns of air quality has also subsided as the Games progressed. However, a 28 July 2008 Greenpeace report stated that average concentration of atmospheric particulate matter in Beijing was still twice the levels the World Health Organization considers safe. Although observers doubted the performance in endurance events due to air quality, humidity and temperature, the men's 10 km and marathon events did set new Olympic records. The Chinese authority pledged to continue their environmental efforts after the Games and pointed to their ¥140 billion investment in the past ten years as evidence of their determination. After witnessing the success of their efforts, some of the temporary measures during the Games are being considered for permanent enforcement.\nAt the end of May 2008, two months before the start of the Olympics, a \"red tide\" (a type of algal bloom) was found to be developing. It began choking large stretches of the Qingdao near to the venue for the sailing events. While algae blooms are known to develop in nutrient-rich water, often as a result of chemical pollution, run-off from heavy fertiliser use or untreated sewerage; Qingdao's Ocean and Fishing Bureau said the particular temperature and salinity of sea water had been responsible in this case.\n\nOfficials in Qingdao achieved their own target of 15 July to clear the algae in the vicinity of the venue. The task force that cleaned-up more than a million tonnes of algae were said to number 1,200 boats and many thousands of troops and volunteers.\n\nA oil slick was discovered off the coast of Qingdao on 11 August. Officials said that the oil would not affect Olympic sailing, and all the sailing events proceeded as scheduled.\n\nPrior to the Games, officials anticipated two million tourists, of which one-third would be from overseas. However, actual volume of visitors fell 9.2% year-on-year. Chinese officials cited the Sichuan earthquake, riots in Tibet, torch relay protests and the subprime mortgage crisis as factors. Locally, many people anticipated that Beijing would be too crowded during the Games. Businesses avoided scheduling meetings during these two weeks, and potential Chinese visitors decided to stay at home and watch the events on TV.\n\nInitially, many hotel owners invested heavily for the Olympics. Many anticipated bookings in the 70% to 80% level, and room prices jumped as much as ten times the regular level. Occupancy of 77% was reported for luxury hotels in early August. For 4-star hotels and lower, occupancy of 40% led to price reductions, although still at three times the regular price. In July, Air China, the nation's flagship carrier, also saw its international passenger traffic fall by 19% from a year earlier.\n\nHoteliers blamed the lack of visitors on increased security measures and the tightening of visa rules and for driving out thousands of itinerant foreigners and overseas students living in Beijing. Visa requirements introduced in April required foreign visitors to have proof of their accommodation and return flight when applying to enter China. One foreign Olympics consultant was quoted as saying \"they made it hard to get tickets and hard to get visas. The impression they gave was that they didn’t want foreigners to come\".\n\nAccording to the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee (BOCOG), the 6.8 million tickets to the Games were sold out. The prevalence of empty seats at many events caused journalists and visitors to be suspicious about these claims. Beijing Olympic organisers were said to have given some 2.7 million tickets to officials and corporate sponsors, many of whom did not attend the events. A mainland journal suggested that the day-tickets without right of re-entry was also part of the problem. In one instance, people in the audience left the stadium after the Chinese women's volleyball match, but they were not allowed back when they found out there was another game. A senior BOCOG official expressed concern about the empty seats, saying that the hot, humid weather could have caused the poor turnout. Officials admitted to bussing in locals or \"cheerleaders\" to fill seats. The empty seats angered athletes of countries outside China, who had been told that 80 percent of tickets had been reserved for the Chinese.\n\nDespite early warnings published by \"The Guardian\" and efforts by official ticketing coordinators, more than $6 million in fraudulent tickets were sold by an illegitimate online ticket broker.\n\n"}

Davies describes himself as an Anabaptist youth pastor, \"reformed homosexual\", and lead singer for the band Evening Service. Davies and the band were unknown until the release of the music video for the anti-homosexuality song \"The Bible Says\" on the Internet in January 2007. Davies claims affiliation with the organization Love God's Way Ministries, which launched a website around the same time as the release of the video. He is also the founder and spokesman for the C.H.O.P.S. program. The acronym stands for \"Changing Homosexuals into Ordinary People Sexually\". C.H.O.P.S. is promoted through Love God's Way's website.\n\nHis video was removed from YouTube.com without comment from the company and has been removed by Google. It has since been put back up on YouTube.\n\nMuch of the initial controversy revolved around whether or not Davies is genuinely promoting an anti-gay agenda, or if this is a viral marketing campaign. Some gay rights advocates acknowledge that as a spoof it is humorous, but claim the message behind it is still as malicious as someone who seriously possessed the opinion. Debate has quickly risen regarding the authenticity of Davies' youth ministry activities, the band Evening Service, and the organization Love God's Way ranging from entertainment publications such as \"Spin\" to thousands of personal blogs Some in the blogosphere maintained that Davies was truly seeking to \"convert\" other homosexuals to heterosexuality . Others considered Davies ministry and the video part of a carefully designed hoax mocking the Christian Conservative community. Other controversies involve the claims on Donnie's website of what music \"will make you gay.\" This included some of his own music.\n\nGay rights organizations, such as Heartstrong, are addressing this as a serious threat to the gay community.\n\nSeveral blogs speculated that Donnie Davies was a character created by improv actor Todd Quillen or out gay director Jason Bolicki.\n\nOn 9 February 2007, MTV News Webcam Correspondent posted a video on YouTube, proving Donnie Davies to be a character played by actor Joey Oglesby. The piece interviewed the actor and director and included their surprise that anyone took the video as being serious.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43758363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43758363", "title": "Gamergate controversy", "text": "Gamergate controversy\n\nThe Gamergate controversy stemmed from a harassment campaign conducted primarily through the use of the hashtag #GamerGate. The controversy centered on issues of sexism and progressivism in video game culture. \"Gamergate\" is used as a blanket term for the controversy as well as for the harassment campaign and actions of those participating in it.\n\nIn August 2014, the harassment campaign targeted several women in the video game industry; notably game developers Zoë Quinn and Brianna Wu, as well as feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. After Eron Gjoni, Quinn's former boyfriend, wrote a disparaging blog post about her, #gamergate hashtag users falsely accused Quinn of an unethical relationship with journalist Nathan Grayson. Harassment campaigns against Quinn and others included doxing, threats of rape, and death threats. \n\nGamergate proponents (\"Gamergaters\") said that they were a movement, but had no official leaders, spokespeople, or manifesto. Gamergate supporters organized anonymously or pseudonymously on online platforms such as 4chan, Internet Relay Chat, Twitter, and Reddit. Statements claiming to represent Gamergate have been inconsistent and contradictory, making it difficult for commentators to identify goals and motives. Gamergate supporters said there was unethical collusion between the press and feminists, progressives, and social critics. These concerns have been dismissed by commentators as trivial, conspiracy theories, groundless, or unrelated to actual issues of ethics. As a result, Gamergate has often been defined by the harassment its supporters engaged in. Gamergate supporters have frequently responded to this by denying that the harassment took place or by falsely claiming that it was manufactured by the victims.\n\nThe controversy has been described as a manifestation of a culture war over cultural diversification, artistic recognition, and social criticism in video games, and over the social identity of gamers. Many supporters of Gamergate oppose what they view as the increasing influence of feminism on video game culture; as a result, Gamergate is often viewed as a right-wing backlash against progressivism. \n\nIndustry responses to the harassment campaign have focused on ways to minimise harm and prevent similar events. Gamergate has led figures both inside and outside the industry to focus on methods of addressing online harassment.\n\nIn 2013, Zoë Quinn, an independent game developer, released \"Depression Quest\", a text-focused game designed to convey the experience of depression though a series of fictional scenarios, based in part on Quinn's own experience with the illness. The game received positive reviews in the gaming media, but faced backlash online from gamers who disliked its departure from typical game formats emphasizing violence and skill and who opposed \"political\" intrusions into gamer culture. Quinn was subjected to several months of harassment after its release, including rape and death threats. Quinn documented the harassment she received and spoke openly to the media about it, which led to an even greater intensity of abuse against her, including the posting of her home address online. She ultimately fled her house out of fear for her safety.\n\nThe event that would come to be known as Gamergate began in 2014 as a personal attack on Quinn, incited by a blog post by Quinn's former boyfriend Eron Gjoni. Called the \"Zoe Post\", it was a lengthy, detailed account of their relationship and breakup that included copies of personal chat logs, emails, and text messages. The blog falsely implied that Quinn had gotten a favorable review of \"Depression Quest\" because of her sexual relationship with Nathan Grayson, a video-game reviewer for the website \"Kotaku\". Grayson never actually reviewed Quinn's games, and Grayson's only article mentioning her was published before their relationship began. Gjoni later updated his blog post to acknowledge this, saying that a typographical error was to blame. Nonetheless, a link to the blog posted on 4chan, where many participants had previously been highly critical of \"Depression Quest\", led to renewed attacks on Quinn.\n\nAfter Gjoni's blog post, Quinn and her family were subjected to a virulent and often misogynistic harassment campaign. Online attackers of Quinn at first used the label \"Quinnspiracy\", later adopting the hashtag \"#Gamergate\" after it was coined by the actor Adam Baldwin, whose nearly 190,000 Twitter followers helped the spread of the hashtag. Harassment of Gamergate targets was coordinated via Internet Relay Chat (IRC), spreading rapidly over imageboards and forums like 4chan and Reddit.\n\nWithin four months of the start of Gamergate, Quinn's record of threats she had received had grown 1,000-fold. At a conference Quinn said, \"I used to go to game events and feel like I was going home [...] Now it's just like... are any of the people I'm currently in the room with ones that said they wanted to beat me to death?\". One anonymous 4chan user threatened to \"give her a crippling injury that's never going to fully heal\". Commentators both inside and outside the video game industry condemned the attacks against Quinn. The attacks included doxing (researching and broadcasting personally identifiable information about an individual) and hacking of her Tumblr, Dropbox, and Skype accounts; she was again subjected to rape and death threats. Quinn again fled her home to stay with friends. She wrote that \"the Internet spent the last month spreading my personal information around, sending me threats, hacking anyone suspected of being friends with me, calling my dad and telling him I’m a whore, sending nude photos of me to colleagues, and basically giving me the 'burn the witch' treatment\".\n\nGamergate supporters subjected others to similar harassment, doxing, and death threats. Those who came to the victims' defense were ridiculed as \"white knights\", or \"social justice warriors\" (SJWs); this characterization was intended, according to Heron, Belford and Goker, to neutralize any opposition by questioning their motives. Shortly after the Gamergate hashtag was coined, video game developer Phil Fish had his personal information, including various accounts and passwords, hacked and publicly posted in retaliation for defending Quinn and attacking her detractors. The hacks and doxing also exposed documents relating to Fish's company, Polytron. As a result, Fish left the gaming industry and put Polytron up for sale, calling the situation \"unacceptable\" and saying, \"it's not worth it\".\n\nThe campaign expanded to include renewed harassment of prominent feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian, who had previously been a target of online harassment due in part to her YouTube video series \"Tropes vs. Women in Video Games\", which analyzes sexist stereotypes in video games. Sarkeesian's attackers took her critical commentary as unfair and unwarranted, and considered her an interloper. After a new episode of \"Tropes vs. Women\" was released on August 24, 2014, Sarkeesian received rape and death threats, and private information including her home address was leaked; she was compelled to flee her home. At the XOXO arts and technology conference in Portland, Oregon, she said, in regard to the accusations that high-profile women were making up the threats against them, that \"one of the most radical things you can do is to actually believe women when they talk about their experiences\". \"The perpetrators\", Sarkeesian went on to say, \"do not see themselves as perpetrators at all [...] They see themselves as noble warriors\".\n\nSarkeesian canceled an October 2014 speaking appearance at Utah State University (USU) after the school received three anonymous threats, the second of which claimed affiliation with Gamergate. The initial threat proposed that \"a Montreal Massacre style attack will be carried out against the attendees, as well as the students and staff at the nearby Women's Center\", alluding to the École Polytechnique massacre, a 1989 mass shooting motivated by antifeminism. USU's President and Provost released a joint statement saying that USU, in consultation with state and federal law enforcement agencies, had assessed that there was no credible threat to students, staff or the speaker. Requests for additional security measures were declined because of Utah's open carry laws, leading to the cancellation. The threats drew the attention of mainstream media to the Gamergate situation. Wingfield of \"The New York Times\" referred to the threat as \"the most noxious example of a weeks long campaign to discredit or intimidate outspoken critics of the male-dominated gaming industry and its culture\". The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated the threat to attack Sarkeesian and other Gamergate-related threats. The investigations, which were plagued with jurisdictional issues, ultimately closed with the FBI failing to identify the perpetrators of some threats and declining to prosecute others.\nIn mid-October Brianna Wu, another independent game developer and co-founder of video game studio Giant Spacekat, saw her home address and other identifying information posted on 8chan as retaliation for mocking Gamergate. Wu then became the target of rape and death threats on Twitter and elsewhere. After contacting police, Wu fled her home with her husband, saying she would not allow the threats to intimidate her into silence. Wu announced an reward for information leading to a conviction for those involved in her harassment, and set up a legal fund to help other game developers who have been harassed online. As of April 2016, Wu was still receiving threats in such volume that she employed full-time staff to document them.\n\nHarassment related to Gamergate continued for several months after the onset of the controversy. Two critics of Gamergate were targets of attempted \"swatting\"—hoaxed reports to emergency services intended to provoke a SWAT team response at the target's home. \"The Guardian\" reported that both swatting attempts were coordinated through the \"baphomet\" subforum of 8chan. After the initial rush of threats that caused her to flee her home, Wu documented receiving roughly 45 death threats by April 2015; Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen offered up to a $10,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those who made the threats. Wu's studio, Giant Spacekat, withdrew from the Expo Hall of PAX East 2015. Wu cited security concerns, lack of confidence in the management and their failure to return calls.\n\nActress and gamer Felicia Day wrote a blog post about her concerns over Gamergate and her fear of retaliation if she spoke against it. Almost immediately her home address and phone number were posted online, leading to harassing letters and phone calls. Actor Wil Wheaton and former NFL player Chris Kluwe also posted criticisms of Gamergate. Stephen Colbert questioned why men like Kluwe had not been threatened by Gamergate, noting that the targets were almost entirely women.\n\nSome who have identified as Gamergate supporters said that they have been harassed. YouTube personality Steven \"Boogie2988\" Williams remarked that a comment on one of his videos included his address and a threat to his wife's life. In an interview with BBC Three, Gamergate supporter John Bain, known by his YouTube moniker \"TotalBiscuit\", said he had been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate. Mike Diver wrote in \"Vice\" that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage. According to the BBC, the technology writer Allum Bokhari said that a \"well-known trolling group\" was \"working to provoke both sides against each other\".\n\nBomb threats have also been made towards events attended by Gamergate supporters. A May 2015 meeting in Washington D.C. arranged by writer Christina Hoff Sommers and journalist Milo Yiannopoulos was the target of a bomb threat made over Twitter, according to local police responding to information supplied by the FBI. During \"Airplay\", an event run by the Society of Professional Journalists in August 2015, multiple bomb threats were made. This led to the evacuation of the building and the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nGamergate harassment was orchestrated largely through anonymous message boards such as 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, particularly the \"KotakuInAction\" subreddit. \"Ars Technica\" reported that a series of 4chan discussion logs suggests that Twitter sockpuppet accounts were used to popularize the Gamergate hashtag. Heron, Belford, and Goker, analyzing the logs, said that early Gamergate IRC discussions focused on coordinating the harassment of Quinn by using astroturf campaigns to push attacks against her into mainstream view. They also describe how initial organizers attempted to cultivate a palpable narrative for public consumption while internally focusing on personal grudges against Quinn and aggressive sexual imagery. Mortensen wrote in \"Games and Culture\" that Gamergate's structure as an anonymous swarm allowed it to create an environment where anyone who criticized it or became its target was at risk, while allowing them to avoid individual responsibility for harassment.\n\nThere has been considerable discussion of self-policing and the responsibility supporters of Gamergate share when the hashtag is used for harassment. A number of websites have blocked users, removed posts, and created policies to prevent their users from threatening Quinn and others with doxing, assault, rape and murder, and planning and coordinating such threats. 4chan founder Christopher Poole banned all discussion of Gamergate on the site as more attacks occurred, leading to Gamergate supporters using 8chan as their central hub.\n\nMany Gamergate supporters have denied that the harassment took place, or falsely accused victims of fabricating the evidence. Gamergate supporters have used the term \"Literally Who\" to refer to victims of harassment such as Quinn, saying they are not relevant to Gamergate's goals and purposes. Commentators have decried the use of such terminology as dehumanizing, and said that discussions on Gamergate forums often center around those referred to as \"Literally Who\". Some Gamergate supporters have denounced the harassment, arguing that the perpetrators are in the minority and do not represent them.\n\nBy September 24, 2014, over one million Twitter messages incorporating the Gamergate hashtag had been sent. A \"Newsweek\" and Brandwatch analysis found more than two million Twitter messages between September and October 2014. Software developer Andy Baio also produced an analysis of #Gamergate tweets showing a discussion that was polarized between pro- and anti-Gamergate factions. One quarter of the tweets sampled were produced by users new to Twitter, most of whom were pro-Gamergate. While the number of Gamergate supporters is unclear, in October 2014 \"Deadspin\" estimated 10,000 supporters based on the number of users discussing Gamergate on Reddit.\n\nThe series of events that came to be known as Gamergate has been described as \"torturously complex\". As a movement, it had no official leaders or clearly defined agenda. Because of its anonymous membership, lack of organization and leaderless nature, sources differ as to the goals or mission of Gamergate and defining it has been difficult. Frank Lantz of NYU's Game Center wrote that he could not find \"a single explanation of a coherent Gamergate position\". Christopher Grant, editor-in-chief of \"Polygon\", told the \"Columbia Journalism Review\": \"The closest thing we've been able to divine is that it's noise. It's chaos [...] all you can do is find patterns. And ultimately Gamergate will be defined—I think has been defined—by some of its basest elements.\"\n\nAs the threats expanded, international media focused on Gamergate's violent, misogynistic element and its inability to present a coherent message. Bob Stuart, in \"The Daily Telegraph,\" reported that \"Gamergate has since swelled into an unwieldy movement with no apparent leaders, mission statement, or aims beyond calling out 'social justice warriors'. [...] When members of the games industry are being driven from their houses and jobs, threatened, or abused, it makes Gamergate's claim that it is engaged in an ethical campaign appear laughable.\" The campaign's focus broadened to take on other targets in the news media, as with Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker Media.\n\nJesse Singal, in \"New York\", stated that he had spoken to several Gamergate supporters to try to understand their concerns, but found conflicting ideals and incoherent messages. Singal observed Gamergate supporters making a constant series of attacks on Quinn, Sarkeesian, and other women, while frequently stating that Gamergate \"is not about\" them. Chris Ip of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" said that any legitimate message from Gamergate supporters regarding ethics in journalism was lost in the noise created by harassment, sexism, and misogyny. With anyone able to tweet under the hashtag and no single person willing or able to represent the hashtag and take responsibility for its actions, Ip said it is not possible for journalists to neatly separate abusers from those seeking reasonable debate. \n\nJon Stone wrote in \"The Guardian\" that readjusts and reinvents itself in response to attempts to disarm and disperse its noxiousness, subsuming disaffected voices in an act of continual regeneration, cycling through targets, pretexts, manifestoes, and moralisms\". \"Polygon\"s Grant said that Gamergate has remained amorphous and leaderless so that the harassment can be conducted without any culpability.\n\nWhile organized through anonymous message boards such as 4chan and Reddit, Gamergate harassment was most prominent on Twitter. Michael Salter, a University of Western Sydney criminologist, writes that Twitter's design and architecture was \"highly conducive\" to such abuse campaigns, allowing Gamergaters to overwhelm users' ability to individually block the large numbers of fake or \"sockpuppet\" accounts used to send abusive and harassing messages. \n\nTwitter was criticized for its inability to respond quickly and prevent harassment over the service. Within the United States, Twitter and other social media sites are not liable for content posted by third-parties of their service under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (1996), and so have no legal obligation to police malicious content such as harassment and threats. Brianna Wu, shortly after becoming a target of harassment, stated that Twitter facilitated harassment by the ease with which anyone could make a new account even after having an earlier account blocked, and challenged the service to improve its responsiveness to complaints. Robinson Meyer of \"The Atlantic\" said Gamergate is an \"identity crisis\" for Twitter, and by not dealing with harassing users, the platform is failing to protect victims.\n\nEarly on during Gamergate, software developer Randi Harper started the \"Good Game Auto Blocker\" or \"ggautoblocker\", an expanding list of known Twitter accounts that were tied to the Gamergate hashtag which could be automatically blocked, therefore reducing the degree of harassment received. In November 2014, Twitter announced a collaboration with the non-profit group \"Women, Action & the Media\" (WAM), in which users of Twitter can report harassment to a tool monitored by WAM members, who would forward affirmed issues to Twitter within 24 hours. The move, while arising in the wake of the Gamergate harassment, was due to general issues of the harassment of women on the Internet. In May 2015, WAM reported that of 512 reported harassment instances by the tool during the month of November 2014, 12% of those were tied to the Gamergate controversy based on the ggautoblocker list, with most harassment occurring from single-instance accounts targeting a single person.\n\nEarly in the controversy, posters on 4chan focused on donating to a self-described radical feminist group called The Fine Young Capitalists (TFYC), who had been embroiled in a dispute with Quinn over a female-only game development contest they had organized. Advocating donations to help TFYC create the game, posters on 4chan's politics board argued that such donations would make them \"look really good\" and would make them \"PR-untouchable\".\n\nTo respond to widespread criticism of Gamergate as misogynistic, posters on 4chan created a second Twitter hashtag, #NotYourShield, intended to show that Gamergate was not about opposition to feminism or wanting to push women out of gaming. In the 4chan post that may have coined the hashtag, it was framed as a way to \"demand the SJWs stop using you as a shield to deflect genuine criticism\". Many of the accounts used to tweet the tag seemed to be sockpuppets that had copied their avatars from elsewhere on the internet; the methods used to create it have been compared to #EndFathersDay, a hoax manufactured on 4chan using similar methods. Quinn said that in light of Gamergate's exclusive targeting of women or those who stood up for women, \"#notyourshield was, ironically, solely designed to be a shield for this campaign once people started calling it misogynistic\". Arthur Chu wrote that the hashtag was an attempt to leverage white guilt and to prevent allies from supporting the people being attacked by Gamergate.\n\nGamergate supporters were critical of the wave of articles calling for diversity that followed the initial outbreak of the controversy; interpreting them as an attack on games and gamer culture. Gamergaters responded with a coordinated email campaign that demanded advertisers drop several involved publications; in a five-step 'war plan' against organizations that offended them, a Gamergate posting described how they would choose from a list of target organizations, pick a grievance from a list others had compiled, and send a form letter containing it to an advertiser. Intel reacted to this by withdrawing an ad campaign from Gamasutra in October 2014. After a number of game developers criticized Intel for this, arguing that it could have a chilling effect on free speech and that it amounted to supporting harassment, Intel apologized for appearing to take sides in the controversy and resumed advertising on Gamasutra in mid-November.\n\nGamergate became associated with the \"Sad Puppies\" and \"Rabid Puppies\" during 2015 Hugo Awards for science fiction writing. These groups organized voting blocs that dominated the 2015 Hugo Awards. The campaign was described as a backlash against the increasing racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in science fiction. Members of the bloc said that they sought to counteract what they saw as a focus on giving awards based on the race, ethnicity, or gender of the author or characters rather than quality, and bemoaning the increasing prominence of what they described as 'message' fiction with fewer traditional \"zap gun\" sciencefictional trappings. By 2018, the Sad Puppies had diminished visibility, and Quinn's 2017 memoir, \"\", was nominated for the 2018 Hugo Award for Best Related Work (for non-fiction works related to science fiction or fantasy).\n\nThe most active Gamergate supporters or \"Gamergaters\" said that Gamergate was a movement for ethics in games journalism and that any harassment of women was done by others not affiliated with Gamergate. They argued that the close relationships between journalists and developers demonstrated a conspiracy among reviewers to focus on progressive social issues, leading to conflicts of interest. Some supporters pointed to what they considered disproportionate praise for games such as \"Depression Quest\" and \"Gone Home\", which feature unconventional gameplay and stories with social implications, while they viewed traditional AAA games as downplayed. Journalists who did not cover the examination into Quinn's private life were accused of conspiracy, and a blacklist circulated by Gamergate supporters.\n\nObservers in the media have largely rejected these claims as baseless. Chris Ip of the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" wrote that \"many criticisms of press coverage by people who identify with Gamergate [...] have been debunked\" and concluded that \"at core, the movement is a classic culture war\". Writing in \"Vox\", Todd VanDerWerff said that \"[e]very single question of journalistic ethics Gamergate has brought up has either been debunked or dealt with\". According to Leigh Alexander, then editor-at-large of \"Gamasutra\", the ethics concerns were a conspiracy theory, albeit a sincere one; Alexander writes that there is nothing unethical about journalists being acquainted with those they cover and that meaningful reporting requires journalists to develop professional relationships with sources. \"Ars Technica\", \"Vox\", and \"Wired\", among others, stated that discussions of gender equality, sexism and other social issues in game reviews present no ethical conflict.\n\nSeveral writers who attempted to understand Gamergate's motivations concluded that, rather than relating to purported issues with gaming journalism ethics, Gamergate represented an effort to suppress opposing views. Salter writes that \"mass media had a decisive role in evaluating the competing claims of Gamergate and its critics, and ultimately dismissing Gamergate as a misogynist abuse campaign\". Screenshots of 4chan boards, collected and published by Quinn, suggested that complaints about ethics in games journalism were invented \"post hoc\" by Gamergaters to distract critics from their ongoing abuse of her. Jay Hathaway wrote at \"Gawker\" that this strategy emerged once Gamergaters found that harassing Quinn about her sexual history was unlikely to win them support; according to Hathaway, IRC chat logs showed that \"the [Gamergate] movement was focused on destroying Zoë Quinn first, reforming games reporting second\".\n\nOther commentators argued that Gamergate had the potential to raise significant issues in gaming journalism, but that the wave of misogynistic harassment and abuse associated with the hashtag had poisoned the well, making it impossible to separate honest criticism from sexist trolling. Visible support for Gamergate in the form of tweets, online videos, and blogs seldom involved discussion of ethics, but often featured misogynistic and/or racist commentary. The targets were mainly female game developers, academics, and writers.\n\nResearchers at the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University described Gamergate as a \"vitriolic campaign against Quinn that quickly morph[ed] into a broader crusade against alleged corruption in games journalism\" which involved considerable abuse and harassment of female developers and game critics. Concerns have also been raised when juxtaposing the behavior of Gamergate supporters with their claimed message: Dr. Kathleen Bartzen Culver, a professor and media ethics expert at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, wrote that while Gamergate supporters claimed to be interested in journalism ethics, their \"misogynistic and threatening\" behavior belied this claim. \"Much of the conversation—if I can even call it that—has been a toxic sludge of rumor, invective, and gender bias. The irony comes from people who claim to be challenging the ethics of game journalists through patently unethical behavior.\"\n\nAfter analyzing a sample of tweets related to Gamergate, \"Newsweek\" concluded that it was primarily about harassment rather than ethics, stating that the sample \"suggests that [...] contrary to its stated goal, Gamergate spends more time tweeting negatively at game developers than at game journalists\". Casey Johnston wrote for \"Ars Technica\" that, based on logs from the 4chan users who initially pushed Gamergate into the spotlight, the goal behind the hashtag campaign was to \"perpetuate misogynistic attacks by wrapping them in a debate about ethics\". An academic analysis of a week's worth of public posts tagged with #Gamergate found that the issue publics involved were not \"only or even primarily\" concerned with ethics in gaming journalism.\n\nIn an interview with Anita Sarkeesian in \"The Guardian\", Jessica Valenti said that \"the movement's much-mocked mantra, 'It's about ethics in journalism was seen by others as \"a natural extension of sexist harassment and the fear of female encroachment on a traditionally male space\". Sarkeesian asked, \"if this 'movement' was about journalism, why wasn't it journalists who had to deal with a barrage of rape and death threats?\". Wu told \"The Boston Globe\" that the ethics claims were \"a pretext\" and described Gamergate as \"an actual hate group [...] they're upset and threatened by women who are being very outspoken about feminism\".\n\nGamergate has been criticized for focusing on women, especially female developers, while ignoring many large-scale journalistic ethics issues. Alex Goldman of NPR's \"On the Media\" criticized Gamergate for targeting female indie developers rather than AAA games publishers, and said claims of unethical behavior by Quinn and Sarkeesian were unfounded. In \"Wired\", Laura Hudson found it telling that Gamergate supporters concentrated on impoverished independent creators and critics, and nearly exclusively women, rather than the large game companies whose work they enjoyed. \"Vox\" writer Todd VanDerWerff highlighted an essay written by game developer David Hill, who said that corruption, nepotism, and excessive commercialism existed in the gaming industry, but that Gamergate was not addressing those issues. Adi Robertson, of \"The Verge\", commented on the long-standing ethical issues gaming journalism has dealt with, but that most Gamergate supporters did not seem interested in \"addressing problems that don't directly relate to feminist criticism or the tiny indie games scene\".\n\nIn mid-September 2014, Milo Yiannopoulos, vocal critic of feminism and left-wing ideologies, published leaked discussions from a mailing list for gaming journalists called GameJournoPros on the Breitbart News website. Yiannopoulos and Gamergate supporters saw the mailing list as evidence of collusion among journalists. The list's founder acknowledged suggesting that journalists write an open letter of support to Quinn in response to the harassment she was facing, but said other members of the list had rejected his suggestion and helped him understand why his idea was inappropriate. Commentators did not consider the list to represent collusion, observing that it is a standard practice across professions to adopt informal venues for discussing matters of professional interest. Following the leak, the mailing list was closed.\n\nObservers have generally described Gamergate as part of a long-running culture war against efforts to diversify the traditionally male video gaming community, particularly targeting outspoken women. They cite Gamergate supporters' frequent harassment of female figures in the gaming industry and its overt hostility toward people involved in social criticism and analysis of video games. \"The Washington Post\"s digital culture writer Caitlin Dewey said that \"Whatever Gamergate may have started as, it is now an Internet culture war\" between predominantly female game developers and critics advocating for greater inclusion, and \"a motley alliance of vitriolic naysayers\" opposed to such changes. \"Vox\" said that Gamergate supporters were less interested in criticizing ethical issues than in opposition to social criticism and analysis of video games and in harassment of prominent women. \"Ars Technica\" quoted early members as saying that they had no interest in videogames and were primarily interested in attacking Quinn.\n\nGamergate has been described as being driven by antifeminist ideologies. Some supporters have denied this, but acknowledge that there are misogynistic voices within Gamergate. Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in \"Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies\" \"in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens.\" Jon Stone, in \"The Guardian\", called it a \"swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment\" and compared it to the men's rights movement. Commentators such as Stone, Liana Kerzner, and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming. Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism. Some figures associated with Gamergate went on to become components of the so-called alt-right, which thus featured in the 2016 American presidential election.\n\nQuinn said the campaign had \"roped well-meaning people who cared about ethics and transparency into a pre-existing hate mob\", and urged industry publishers and developers to condemn the hashtag. She further asked those Gamergate supporters who had any earnest discussion about ethics to move away from the \"Gamergate\" tag.\n\nGamergate is often considered to be a reaction to the changing cultural identity of the \"gamer\". As video games grew in mainstream popularity during the 1990s, a \"gamer\" identity emerged around games marketed to an audience that was predominantly young, male and heterosexual. Over the years, the growing popularity of games expanded that audience to include many who did not fit the traditional gamer demographic, particularly women. Games with artistic and cultural themes grew in popularity, and independent video game development made these games more common, while mobile and casual games expanded the scope of the industry beyond the traditional gamer identity. The games most popular with typical \"gamers\", often featuring explicit violence along with exaggerated gender stereotypes, were joined by a more diverse set of games that included gay, lesbian, and transgender themes. \"Indie\" gaming blogs and websites were created to comment on these developments, in contrast to the more established gaming press, which was traditionally dependent on the games industry itself.\n\nThe media-studies scholar Adrienne Massanari writes that Gamergate is a direct response to such changes in video-game content as well as changes in the demographics of players. Surveys by the Entertainment Software Association in 2014 and 2015 showed that video-game players were between 44% and 48% female, with an average age of thirty-five. This broader audience began to question some assumptions and tropes that had been common in games. Shira Chess and Adrienne Shaw write that concern over these changes is integral to Gamergate, especially a fear that sexualized games aimed primarily at young men might eventually be replaced by less sexualized games marketed to broader audiences. Gamergaters often dismiss such games and their more diverse, casual group of players as being not \"real\" games or gamers. Alyssa Rosenberg of \"The Washington Post\" said that some of Gamergaters' concerns were rooted in a view of video games as \"appliances\" rather than art, that should be reviewed based on feature checklists rather than traditional artistic criteria. Chris Suellentrop of \"The New York Times\" criticized resistance to innovative uses of the gaming medium, and the belief that increased coverage and praise of artistic games like \"Gone Home\" would negatively affect blockbuster games such as \"Grand Theft Auto V\".\n\nGamergate is particularly associated with opposition to the influence of so-called \"social justice warriors\" in the gaming industry and media, who are perceived as a threat to traditional gaming culture. As the video-game market grew more diverse, cultural critics became interested in issues of gender representation and identity in games. One prominent feminist critic of the representation of women in gaming is Anita Sarkeesian, whose \"Tropes vs. Women in Video Games\" project is devoted to female stereotypes in games. Her fund-raising campaign and videos were met with hostility and harassment by some gamers. Further incidents raised concerns about sexism in video gaming. Prior to August 2014, escalating harassment prompted the International Game Developers Association (IGDA) to provide support groups for harassed developers and to begin discussions with the FBI to help investigate online harassment of game developers. In an interview on Comedy Central's program \"The Colbert Report\", Sarkeesian said she believes women are targeted because they are \"challenging the status quo of gaming as a male-dominated space\".\n\nIn late August 2014, shortly after the initial accusations against Grayson and harassment of Quinn, several gaming sites published opinion essays on the controversy that focused on the growing diversity of gaming and the mainstreaming of the medium, some of which included criticism of sexism within gamer culture. These so-called \"gamers are dead\" articles were seen as part of a conspiracy to undercut traditional gamer identity and were used by participants to rally support for Gamergate. \"Slate's\" David Auerbach and \"The Sentinel's\" David Elks criticized these articles for alienating their publications' audience by attacking the gamer identity. Writing for \"Paste\", L. Rhodes said the antagonism in the Gamergate controversy was a result of the industry seeking to widen its customer demographic instead of focusing on core gamers, which Rhodes says \"is precisely what videogames needed\". Brendan Keogh of \"Overland\" stated that Gamergate \"does not represent a marginalised, discriminated identity under attack so much as a hegemonic and normative mainstream being forced to redistribute some of its power\".\n\nGamergate has been described as an expression of sexism and misogyny within gaming culture; its main themes are criticism of feminism and so-called \"social justice warriors\", who are perceived as a threat to traditional video games. Women's greater visibility in the gaming industry has seen a corresponding rise in gendered harassment and intimidation directed at them. Among mainstream journalists, the harassment campaign that became known as Gamergate is considered emblematic of this surge of online misogyny. According to Sarah Kaplan of \"The Washington Post\", \"sexism in gaming is a long-documented, much-debated but seemingly intractable problem\", and became the crux of the Gamergate controversy. Jaime Weinman writing in \"Maclean's\" said, \"[w]hether it was supposed to be or not, GamerGate is largely about women\". Discussing Gamergate on her ESPN blog, Jane McManus compared the misogyny that women in the gaming industry experience to that faced by the first women entering sporting communities. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has described Gamergate as \"something that we need to stand clearly against\".\n\nSexism and misogyny had been identified as problems in the video game industry and online community prior to the events of Gamergate. Sarkeesian considered that the Internet has a \"boys'-locker-room feel\" to it, with male users trying to show off to each other which causes escalating cases of harassment in situations like Gamergate. In March 2014, game designer Cliff Bleszinski wrote a blog post commenting on the \"latent racism, homophobia and misogyny\" that existed within the online gaming community. In a November 2014 interview with \"Develop\", Wu said the game industry \"has been a boys' club for 30 years\", and that the common portrayal of women as \"sex symbols and damsels in distress\" in video games has led to the players taking the same attitudes. Brendan Sinclair, writing for \"GamesIndustry.biz\", stated that the events of the Gamergate controversy were \"reprehensible and saddening\" and \"this industry has some profound issues in the way it treats women\".\n\nMany commentators have said that the harassment associated with Gamergate springs from this existing well of deep-seated misogyny, and that it was merely brought to the fore by the anonymity of the Internet. Lisa Nakamura, a professor of digital studies at the University of Michigan, wrote that Gamergate \"showed the world the extent of gaming's misogyny\". Regarding the false allegations against Quinn, Amanda Marcotte in an article for \"The Daily Beast\" accused the video game world of being \"thick with misogynists who are aching to swarm\" with hate on any \"random woman held up for them to hate, no matter what the pretext\". She related these attacks to harassment sent to a woman who criticized a \"Teen Titans\" cover and to a community manager of the \"Mighty No. 9\" game because she drew a feminine Mega Man, and virtual rapes committed against women's player avatars in \"Grand Theft Auto V\" and \"DayZ\". In an interview with the BBC, Quinn stated that \"[b]efore [Gamergate] had a name, it was nothing but trying to get me to kill myself, trying to get people to hurt me, going after my family. [...] There is no mention of ethics in journalism at all outside of making the same accusation everybody makes towards any successful woman; that clearly she got to where she is because she had sex with someone.\" Danielle Citron of the University of Maryland wrote that the intent of this type of harassment is to demean the victim, make them doubt their own integrity, and to redefine the victim's identity in order to \"fundamentally distort who she is\".\n\nTargets of Gamergate supporters have overwhelmingly been women, even when men were responsible for the supposed wrongdoings. Writing in \"The New Yorker\", Simon Parkin observed that Quinn was attacked while the male journalist who was falsely accused of reviewing her work favorably largely escaped, revealing the campaign as \"a pretense to make further harassment of women in the industry permissible\". In \"The New York Times\", Chris Suellentrop said that a petition sought to have a female colleague fired for criticizing the portrayal of women in \"Grand Theft Auto V\", while he and many other male critics raised similar concerns but did not face similar reprisals. Most commentators have described Gamergate as consisting largely of white males, though some supporters have said that it includes a notable percentage of women, minorities and LGBT members.\n\nCritics of the movement have described it as a kind of misogynistic terrorism. Writing in \"The Week\", Ryan Cooper called the harassment campaign \"an online form of terrorism\" intended to reverse a trend in gaming culture toward increasing acceptance of women, and stated that social media platforms need to tighten their policies and protections against threats and abuse. Speaking on Iowa Public Radio, academic Cindy Tekobbe said the harassment campaign was intended to drive women from public spaces and intimidate them into silence. Prof. Joanne St. Lewis of the University of Ottawa stated that Gamergate's harassment and threats should be considered acts of terrorism as the perpetrators seek to harm women and to prevent them from speaking back or defending others.\n\nThough \"Newsweek\" reported that the FBI had a file regarding Gamergate, no arrests have been made nor charges filed, and parts of the FBI investigation into the threats had been closed in September 2015 due to a lack of leads. Former FBI supervisory special agent for cybercrimes, Tim Ryan, stated that cyberharassment cases are a low priority for authorities because it is difficult to track down the perpetrator and they have lower penalties compared to other crimes they are tasked to enforce. In June 2015, the US Supreme Court ruled in \"Elonis v. United States\" that harassing messages sent online are not necessarily true threats that would be prosecutable under criminal law and, according to \"Pacific Standard\", this poses a further challenge in policing Gamergate-related harassment. However, the Court's decision also suggested that if threats made over social media were found to be true threats, they should be treated the same as threats made in other forms of communication.\n\nWu has expressed her frustration over how law enforcement agencies have responded to the threats that she and other women in the game industry have received. On public release of the FBI's case files on Gamergate, Wu said she was \"livid\", and that \"Only a fraction of information we gave the FBI was looked into. They failed on all levels.\"The lack of legal enforcement contributes towards the harassers' ability to maintain these activities without any risk of punishment, according to Chrisella Herzog of \"The Diplomatic Courier\"; at worst, harassers would see their social media accounts suspended but are able to turn around to register new accounts to continue to engage.\n\nU.S. Representative Katherine Clark, one of whose constituents was Brianna Wu, called for a stronger response from law enforcement to online abuse, partly as a result of advocacy by the women targeted by Gamergate. On March 10, 2015, Clark wrote a letter to the House Appropriations Committee asking it to call on the Justice Department to crack down on the harassment of women on the internet, saying the campaign of intimidation associated with Gamergate had highlighted the problem. She asked the U.S. Department of Justice to \"prioritize\" online threats against women, saying, \"We do not think this a harmless hoax. We think this has real-life implications for women\". Clark also hosted a Congressional briefing on March 15, along with the Congressional Victims' Rights Caucus to review issues of cyberstalking and online threats; during the briefing, Quinn spoke of her experiences with Gamergate, which an executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence described during the hearing as \"an online hate group [...] which was started by an ex-boyfriend to ruin [Quinn's] life\". On May 27, the United States House of Representatives formally supported Clark's request for increased measures to combat online abuse against women, explicitly pressing for more investigations and prosecutions by the Department of Justice. On June 2, Rep. Clark introduced the \"Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act of 2015\" to Congress. The bill would have allocated more funding for the FBI to employ additional agents to enforce laws against cyberstalking, online criminal harassment, and threats. Two years later, in June 2017, Rep. Clark introduced the \"Online Safety Modernization Act of 2017\" with co-sponsors Reps. Susan Brooks (Indiana) and Pat Meehan (Pennsylvania), which combined several of Clark's previous bills. The bill focused on penalizing \"cybercrimes against individuals\", including doxing, swatting, and sextortion, as well as granting $20 million for law enforcement training to help tackle such crimes, and $4 million to establish the National Resource Center on Cybercrimes Against Individuals in order to study and collect statistics and information related to these crimes.\n\nThe harassment of Quinn, Sarkeesian, Wu, and others led prominent industry professionals to condemn the Gamergate attacks for damaging the video gaming community and the public perception of the industry. \"Vanity Fair\"s Laura Parker stated that the Gamergate situation led those outside of the video game industry to be \"flooded with evidence of the video-game community as a poisonous and unwelcoming place\", furthering any negative views they may have had of video games. Independent game developer Andreas Zecher wrote an open letter calling upon the community to take a stand against the attacks, attracting the signatures of more than two thousand professionals within the gaming industry. Many in the industry saw the signatures \"as proof that the people sending vicious attacks at Quinn and Sarkeesian weren't representative of the video game industry overall\". Writing for \"The Guardian\", Jenn Frank described the tactics used in the harassment campaign and the climate of fear it generated through its attacks on women and their allies, concluding that this alienating and abusive environment would harm not only women but also the industry as a whole. Frank herself received significant harassment for writing this article, and announced an intention to quit games journalism as a result. Games designer Damion Schubert wrote that Gamergate was \"an unprecedented \", and that silencing critiques of games harms games developers by depriving them of feedback. Several video game developers, journalists, and gamers from across various gender, racial, and social backgrounds adopted new Twitter hashtags, such as #INeedDiverseGames, #StopGamergate2014 and #GamersAgainstGamergate, to show solidarity with the people targeted by the harassment and their opposition to the reactionary messages from Gamergate supporters.\n\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation characterized Gamergate as a \"magnet for harassment\", and notes the possible financial risk for companies dealing with it on social media platforms. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a statement condemning the harassment, stating that \"[t]here is no place in the video game community—or our society—for personal attacks and threats\". ESA president Mike Gallagher, speaking at the June 2015 Electronic Entertainment Expo, clarified that the ESA did not become more involved as they felt it was an argument that was outside their industry and their involvement would have been disruptive, but praised the efforts to counter harassment that will benefit the industry in the future. At BlizzCon 2014, Blizzard Entertainment president and co-founder Mike Morhaime denounced recent harassment; blaming a \"small group of people [who] have been doing really awful things\" and \"tarnishing our reputation\" as gamers. He called on attendees to treat each other with kindness and demonstrate to the world that the community rejects harassment. His statements were widely interpreted as referring to Gamergate. CEOs of both the American and European branches of Sony Computer Entertainment, Shawn Layden and Jim Ryan respectively, said the harassment and bullying were absolutely horrific and that such inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated at Sony. The Swedish Games Industry issued a statement denouncing the harassment and sexism from Gamergate supporters.\n\nResponses to Gamergate have encouraged the video game industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a \"Diversity in Technology\" program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at increasing the number of women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that \"it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent\". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling \"Fortune\" \"[i]f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, [...] I think it just makes us think twice at times\". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the \"Seattle Times\", IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, \"Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now. There's ample evidence of that over and over again... What we're finally seeing is that it became so egregious that now companies are starting to wake up and say, \"We need to stop this. This has got to change.\"\n\nThe Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015 included markedly more female protagonists in these new games, as well as more visible presence by women at the event. Some commentators characterized this as a response to Gamergate and a rejection of the misogynistic Gamergate harassment.\n\nThe game \"\" references Gamergate with hashtag, #CrusaderGate, which the Riddler uses to unsuccessfully try to rally the Internet against Batman; bemoaning its failure, the Riddler describes those who use the hashtag as \"idiotic and easily roused rabble\".\n\n\"\", an episode of the crime television series \"\", portrays a fictionalized version of the Gamergate controversy, including a character whom some observers said resembled Sarkeesian and whose story seemed based on those of women subject to the harassment campaign. The 2015 documentary film \"GTFO\" analyzed issues of sexism and harassment in video gaming. The film's director, Shannon Sun-Higginson, stated Gamergate was \"a terrible, terrible thing, but it's actually symptomatic of a wider, cultural, systemic problem\". The Gamergate situation was covered as part of a larger topic of online harassment of women in the June 21, 2015, episode of \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\". The impact of the Gamergate controversy on Brianna Wu was the subject of the March 16, 2016, episode of \"The Internet Ruined My Life\".\n\nIn January 2015, Quinn and Alex Lifschitz created the Crash Override Network, a private group of experts who provide free support and counsel to those that have been harassed online, including as a result of Gamergate, and to work with law authorities and social media sites in response to such threats. Software developer Randi Harper founded a similar group, the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative, a non-profit organization that also seeks to provide aid to those harassed online.\n\nAnita Sarkeesian was named as one of \"Time\" magazine's list of the 30 most influential people on the Internet in March 2015, and later in the magazine's Top 100 Most Influential People of 2015, in recognition of her role in highlighting sexism in the video game community in the wake of the Gamergate controversy. She was also highlighted as one of \"Cosmopolitan\"s fifty \"Internet's Most Fascinating\" in a 2015 list due to her efforts to curb online harassment.\n\nAn on-line abuse panel (itself the subject of controversy) at the 2016 SXSW festival said that there was no technological solution to the problem of harassment given human nature; although policy changes have been made, the larger issue is more societal than platform-specific. Referring to the discussion at SXSW in a speech for Women's History Month, President of the United States Barack Obama said that \"We know that women gamers face harassment and stalking and threats of violence from other players. When they speak out about their experiences, they're attacked on Twitter and other social media outlets, even threatened in their homes.\" Obama urged targets of harassment to speak out, praising the courage of those who had resisted online harassment. \"And what's brought these issues to light is that there are a lot of women out there, especially young women, who are speaking out bravely about their experiences, even when they know they'll be attacked for it\".\n\n"}

Glimmerglass is well known for producing new, lesser-known, and rare works, many of which in years past have been co-produced with the New York City Opera. It is the second-largest summer opera festival in the United States, led by Artistic and General Director Francesca Zambello.\n\nUntil 2011, the company operated under the name Glimmerglass Opera. The company presented its first season in the summer of 1975, when four performances of \"La bohème\" were staged in the auditorium of the Cooperstown High School. In the years since, it has grown considerably and now offers more than 40 performances of four operas, nearly always in new productions, each summer.\n\nOperas have been performed in repertory since 1990. For the first seventeen seasons, all operas were sung in English; since 1992 they have, with some exceptions, been performed in their original language with projected titles in English.\n\nSeveral works have had their American or world premieres at Glimmerglass; the 1999 season featured the world premiere of \"Central Park\", three one-act operas performed as a single work. The triptych was jointly commissioned by Glimmerglass Opera, New York City Opera, and Thirteen/WNET's \"Great Performances\", which telecast it on PBS in January 2000. The telecast was nominated for an Emmy Award.\n\nPaul Kellogg was the General Director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1979 to 1996 and the Artistic Director from 1996 to 2006. Stewart Robertson was music director of Glimmerglass Opera from 1988 to 2006. In October 2008, Glimmerglass Opera announced the appointment of David Angus as the company's next music director, starting in the summer of 2010. Francesca Zambello became artistic and general director of the newly renamed Glimmerglass Festival in 2011.\n\nThe Glimmerglass Festival's Alice Busch Opera Theater, which opened in June 1987, was built on of farmland donated by Tom Goodyear, its first chairman. The 914-seat theater is notable for its pastoral setting, for being the first American opera house built since 1966, and for its sliding walls, closed only while singers are on-stage and in foul weather. The Theater was designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates. \n\nThe new theater was built to move the performances from a high school auditorium with poor acoustics and sight lines and no orchestra pit to a building with an interior designed specifically for opera performances. The exterior design was inspired by local farm buildings to fit with the surrounding landscape and to promote a less formal and more relaxed atmosphere suitable for a summer theater. For environmental and cost efficiencies, the building was designed to use only natural ventilation, without any mechanical heating or cooling.\n\nThe Festival's 2010 season featured four new productions, including Copland's \"The Tender Land\", and Handel's \"Tolomeo\". During the 2011 season Cherubini's \"Médée\" was presented. Also, a double bill featuring the world premiere of \"A Blizzard on Marblehead Neck\", with music by Jeanine Tesori set to Tony Kushner's libretto (a story inspired by the life of Eugene O'Neill) along with \"Later the Same Evening\", a one-act opera based on characters in five of Edward Hopper's paintings with a score by John Musto from a libretto by Mark Campbell.\n\nIn 2012, the festival featured Verdi's \"Aida\", Lully's \"Armide\", Kurt Weill's \"Lost in the Stars\" and the musical \"The Music Man\". \"Armide\" was presented in collaboration with Opera Atelier of Toronto, Canada, and \"Lost in the Stars\" presented in collaboration with Cape Town Opera of South Africa.\n\nThe 2015 festival included Mozart's \"The Magic Flute\", Verdi's \"Macbeth\", Vivaldi's \"Catone in Utica\", and Bernstein's \"Candide\".\n\n2016's season featured Puccini's \"La bohème\", Sondheim's \"\", Rossini's \"La gazza ladra\" (billed as \"The Thieving Magpie\"), and Ward's \"The Crucible\".\n\n\n"}

Originally designed as a reunion celebrating African American college fraternities and sororities, it later gained popularity among a large population that do not attend college due to its various popular social activities. \"Sister\" events also include the Greek Festival in Hampton, Virginia; The Atlanta Greek Picnic in Atlanta, Georgia; The Charlotte Greek Picnic in Charlotte, North Carolina; the Texas Greek Picnic in Houston, Texas, Nashville Greek Picnic in Nashville, Tennessee, the California Greek Picnic in Los Angeles, California and Bikers Week in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\nThe Philadelphia Greek Picnic celebrated its 31st year on July 9, 2005 at the Belmont Grove in Fairmount Park. The Philadelphia Greek Picnic continues to be the nation’s oldest reunion for members of the historic nine African-American fraternities and sororities and people who appreciate and understand college and African American Greek-lettered life.\n\nThe Philadelphia Greek Picnic is co-sponsored by the City of Philadelphia, the Office of the Managing Director, the Fairmount Park Commission, the Philadelphia Police Department and the National Pan-Hellenic Council Inc. of Philadelphia. It is managed and coordinated by volunteers of the nine organizations wishing to make the entire week-long experience unforgettable based upon the themes of\nScholarship, Fellowship and Respect.\n\nDuring the early to mid 1990s the picnic grew national notoriety, attracting college students and party-goers from all over the east coast of the United States. The primary festival held in Fairmount Park frequently registered an attendance of 100,000+ people, with another 100,000-200,000 people scattered across the city in support of the events. Also various hip-hop and R&B celebrities can be seen attending the events.\n\nDuring the week the city receives a large economic boost due to tourism. Hotel and rental-car companies throughout Philadelphia, South Jersey, and Delaware are reserved weeks to months in advance and opportunities for price gouging as the event grows closer are prevalent.\n\nIn recent years, the event has grown smaller, quieter and less troublesome to the police as well as attendants due to restructuring by the event organizers.\n\nFrom the mid to late 1990s the Greek Picnic regressed into an event spoiled by frequent cases of assault, gun-related violence, car-jacking, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and other crimes that seem to only happen at this specific event as opposed to other large gatherings within the city of Philadelphia.\n\nAlso during the event, traffic in the Philadelphia Area, particularly in West Philadelphia and South Street is at its most congested level for the year. The Philadelphia Police department often requires significant overtime of its officers for traffic control as well as crime deterrence.\n\nThe usual events during the week of the Greek Picnic are as follows:\n\n\n"}

She is the second vessel (and frigate) to carry the designation . When not on operations she is assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) and is based at CFB Halifax. \"Toronto\" serves on MARLANT missions protecting Canada's sovereignty in the Atlantic Ocean and enforcing Canadian laws in its territorial sea and exclusive economic zone.\n\nThe \"Halifax\"-class frigate design of which \"Toronto\" belongs, was ordered by the Canadian Forces in 1977 as a replacement for the aging , , , and es of destroyer escorts , which were all tasked with anti-submarine warfare. In July 1983, the federal government approved the budget for the design and construction of the first batch of six new frigates of which \"Toronto\" was a part, out of twelve that were eventually built. To reflect the changing long term strategy of the Navy during the 1980s and 1990s, the \"Halifax\"-class frigates was designed as a general purpose warship with particular focus on anti-submarine capabilities.\n\nAs built, the \"Halifax\"-class vessels displaced and were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . That made them slightly larger than the \"Iroquois\"-class destroyers. The vessels are propelled by two shafts with Escher Wyss controllable pitch propellers driven by a CODOG system of two General Electric LM2500 gas turbines, generating and one SEMT Pielstick 20 PA6 V 280 diesel engine, generating . \n\nThis gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at while using their diesel engines. Using their gas turbines, the ships have a range of at . The \"Halifax\" class have a complement of 198 naval personnel of which 17 are officers and 17 aircrew of which 8 are officers.\n\nAs built the \"Halifax\"-class vessels deployed the CH-124 Sea King helicopter, which acted in concert with shipboard sensors to seek out and destroy submarines at long distances from the ships. The ships have a helicopter deck fitted with a \"bear trap\" system allowing the launch and recovery of helicopters in up to sea state 6. The \"Halifax\" class also carries a close-in anti-submarine weapon in the form of the Mark 46 torpedo, launched from twin Mark 32 Mod 9 torpedo tubes in launcher compartments either side of the forward end of the helicopter hangar.\n\nAs built, the anti-shipping role is supported by the RGM-84 Harpoon Block 1C surface-to-surface missile, mounted in two quadruple launch tubes at the main deck level between the funnel and the helicopter hangar. For anti-aircraft self-defence the ships are armed with the Sea Sparrow vertical launch surface-to-air missile in two Mk 48 Mod 0 eight-cell launchers placed to port and starboard of the funnel. The vessels carry 16 missiles. A Raytheon/General Dynamics Phalanx Mark 15 Mod 21 Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) is mounted on top of the helicopter hangar for \"last-ditch\" defence against targets that evade the Sea Sparrow.\n\nAs built, the main gun on the forecastle is a /70 calibre Mark 2 gun from Bofors. The gun is capable of firing shells at a rate of 220 rounds per minute at a range of more than .\n\nAs built, the decoy system comprises Two BAE Systems Shield Mark 2 decoy launchers which fire chaff to and infrared rockets to in distraction, confusion and centroid seduction modes. The torpedo decoy is the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie towed acoustic decoy from Argon ST. The ship's radar warning receiver, the CANEWS (Canadian Electronic Warfare System), SLQ-501, and the radar jammer, SLQ-505, were developed by Thorn and Lockheed Martin Canada.\n\nTwo Thales Nederland (formerly Signaal) SPG-503 (STIR 1.8) fire control radars are installed one on the roof of the bridge and one on the raised radar platform immediately forward of the helicopter hangar. The ship is also fitted with Raytheon AN/SPS-49(V)5 long-range active air search radar operating at C and D bands, Ericsson HC150 Sea Giraffe medium-range air and surface search radar operating at G and H bands, and Kelvin Hughes Type 1007 I-band navigation radar. The sonar suite includes the CANTASS Canadian Towed Array and GD-C AN/SQS-510 hull mounted sonar and incorporates an acoustic range prediction system. The sonobuoy processing system is the GD-C AN/UYS-503.\n\nThe \"Halifax\" class underwent a modernization program, known as the Halifax Class Modernization (HCM) program, in order to update the frigates' capabilities in combatting modern smaller, faster and more mobile threats. This involved upgrading the command and control, radar, communications, electronic warfare and armament systems. Further improvements, such as modifying the vessel to accommodate the new Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter and satellite links will be done separately from the main Frigate Equipment Life Extension (FELEX) program.\n\nThe FELEX program comprised upgrading the combat systems integration to CMS330. The SPS-49 2D long-range air search radar was replaced by the Thales Nederland SMART-S Mk 2 E/F-band 3D surveillance radar, and the two STIR 1.8 fire-control radars were replaced by a pair of Saab Ceros 200 recontrol radars. A Telephonics IFF Mode 5/S interrogator was installed and the Elisra NS9003A-V2HC ESM system replaced the SLQ-501 CANEWS. An IBM multi-link (Link 11, Link 16 and Link 22 enabled) datalink processing system was installed along with two Raytheon Anschütz Pathfinder Mk II navigation radars. Furthermore, Rheinmetall's Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS), known as MASS DUERAS, was introduced to replace the Plessey Shield decoy system. The existing 57 mm Mk 2 guns were upgraded to the Mk 3 standard, the Harpoon missiles were improved to Block II levels, the Phalanx was upgraded to Block 1B, and the obsolete Sea Sparrow system was replaced by the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile.\n\n\"Toronto\" was laid down on 22 April 1989 by Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd. at Saint John, New Brunswick and launched on 18 December 1990. The frigate was commissioned into the Canadian Forces on 29 July 1993 at Toronto, Ontario and carries the hull classification symbol FFH 333.\n\nIn 1994, \"Toronto\" deployed to the Adriatic Sea in support of the NATO blockade of Yugoslavia. In 1995, with and , \"Toronto\" sailed to Europe making a series of port visits in commemoration of the end of the Second World War in Europe. The same year, the ship took part in the NATO naval exercise Linked Seas off Portugal. In 1996, \"Toronto\" sailed through the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes making several port visits. \n\nIn 1998, \"Toronto\" joined the NATO fleet STANAVFORLANT in January. On 10 February, the ship was redeployed to the Persian Gulf to assist in the enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. During the ship's deployment, the frigate served with a United States Navy fleet. The ship returned to Canada on 16 June. On 5 December, \"Toronto\" sailed to the Middle East as part of Operation Apollo in the War in Afghanistan. The ship returned to Canada on 27 May 2002. From January to July 2004, \"Toronto\" took part in Operation Altair, operating with the Carrier Strike Group as part of a U.S.-led coalition in Operation Enduring Freedom. In summer 2005, \"Toronto\" performed another tour of the Great Lakes.\n\nOn 6 September 2005, \"Toronto\", with , and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel , were dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico to aid the United States in their response to the flooding of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. In 2008, \"Toronto\" with and the Canadian Coast Guard vessel made an Arctic patrol through Frobisher Bay as part of Operation Nanook. In 2009, \"Toronto\" deployed to the Caribbean Sea to perform drug-smuggling interdiction duties as part of Operation Caribbe. The ship returned to the Caribbean in 2011 as part of Operation Caribbe.\n\n\"Toronto\" participated in Operation Artemis, commencing her first rotation (ROTO 2) in January 2013 and finishing in February 2014 (which included a crew swap in July 2013 [the first crew swap in RCN history since 1991]).\n\nWhile relieving in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Standing NATO Maritime Group 2, \"Toronto\" was reassigned to the Black Sea for Operation Reassurance in response to Russian intervention in Central and Eastern Europe. \"Toronto\" led Task Unit 2 (TU.02) and worked in concert with Spanish Navy frigate , and operated with Romanian Navy frigate \"Regele Ferdinand\" and United States Navy destroyer as well as other vessels from Bulgaria, Georgia, Turkey, and Ukraine.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, \"Toronto\" was circled by two Russian Su-24 attack aircraft and a Russian surveillance plane in a provocative manner. In November 2014, six members of the crew helped fight a fire while on shore leave in Antalya, Turkey. While in the Mediterranean Sea, \"Toronto\" suffered a fire in its auxiliary machinery room on 25 December 2014. The fire was extinguished and all personnel affected by the smoke were treated and released. During the frigate's deployment, \"Toronto\" participated in three naval exercises and led Task Unit 2 while operating in the Black Sea. relieved the ship in January 2015.\n\n\"Toronto\" was the last ship of the class to complete her FELEX refit, which was performed at Irving Shipyards in Halifax. The vessel was returned to the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 November 2016 to begin sea trials. The vessel was not expected to be operational until 2017–18. In January 2018, \"Toronto\" trained with the new Resolve-class auxiliary vessel, off the coast of Nova Scotia. In October, \"Toronto\" was deployed to European waters. During a series of exercises in UK waters, the frigate developed a significant electrical problem that caused a loss of power to the ship. Power was later restored and \"Toronto\" was ordered to Belfast for repairs. As the frigate was docking in Belfast, a small fire began in the starboard gas turbine enclosure in the forward engine room, which was quickly extinguished by the crew. This marked the second such fire in days aboard \"Halifax\"-class frigates, the first aboard .\n\n\n"}

Set between 1989 and 1991, the film is a dramatization of the Hillsborough disaster, which saw 96 football supporters lose their lives at Hillsborough in Sheffield.\n\nIn April 1989, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest met in the semi-finals of the FA Cup. The match was played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield but was abandoned shortly after the match had started when it became clear that the fans packed in to the Leppings Lane end of the ground were being crushed against fencing. 94 fans died that day, with a 95th victim dying a few days later, and the final death toll reaching 96 in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, two women who had lost children in the disaster asked McGovern if he would write their story. He began by interviewing the families of the victims, and became so angry at the unfolding story that he brought in writer Katy Jones to verify that his writing was not skewed in any way.\n\nThe film was produced by Granada Television for ITV and aired for the first time on 5 December 1996. Since then, it has been repeated four times: 10 years after the disaster (15 April 1999), 20 years after the disaster (17 April 2009), on 14 September 2012 after the report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel was published, and on 1 May 2016 after the conclusion of the second inquest which ruled that the 96 victims were unlawfully killed.\n\nThough filmed after the death of the final victim (Tony Bland) who died in March 1993, after being in a coma for nearly four years, the time setting of the film concluded in 1991 when the death toll stood at 95.\n\n\nThe film was generally well received by the public and television critics. The Independent Television Commission praised Granada for the drama in its annual programme review, describing it as \" 'arguably the most powerful drama on the screen in 1996'.\" It won the BAFTA Television Award in 1997 for Best Single Drama, Best Editing and Best Sound. In 2000, the British Film Industry placed \"Hillsborough\" at number 54 in its list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.\n\nFive months after the twentieth anniversary of the tragedy, on 7 September 2009, the \"Hillsborough\" docu-drama was released on DVD.\n"}

It was popularized in 1934 by Cab Calloway. It is a lively and uninhibited variation of the Jitterbug, a form of Swing dance. Glenn Miller introduced his own jive dance in 1938 with the song \"Doin' the Jive\" which never caught on.\n\nThe hand jive is one of the five International Latin dances. In competition it is danced at a speed of 176 beats per minute, although in some cases this is reduced to between 128 and 160 beats per minute. \n\nMany of its basic patterns are similar to these of the East Coast Swing with the major difference of highly syncopated rhythm of the Triple Steps (Chasses), which use straight eighths in ECS and hard swing in Jive. To the players of swing music in the 1930s and 1940s \"Jive\" was an expression denoting glib or foolish talk.\n\nAmerican soldiers brought Lindy Hop/Jitterbug to Europe around 1940, where this dance swiftly found a following among the young. In the United States the term Swing became the most common word used to describe the dance, and the term \"jive\" was adopted in the UK. Variations in technique led to styles such as boogie-woogie and swing boogie, with \"jive\" gradually emerging as the generic term in the UK.\n\nAfter the war, the boogie became the dominant form for popular music. It was, however, never far from criticism as a foreign, vulgar dance. The famous ballroom dancing guru, Alex Moore, said that he had \"never seen anything uglier\". In 1968 it was adopted as the fifth Latin dance in International competitions. The modern form of ballroom jive in the 1990s–present, is a very happy and boppy dance, the lifting of knees and the bending or rocking of the hips often occurs.\n\n"}

It has been held regularly on the second Sunday of May since 1955. Most recently, the 44th edition took place on May 10, 2015, with the 45th expecting to take place on May 13, 2018. The parade commemorates an Ypres tradition from the Middle Ages in which cats were thrown from the belfry tower of the Cloth Hall to the town square below.\n\nThere are various legends about how the throwing of cats originated. One possibility is that cats were connected to witchcraft, and the throwing of the cats symbolised the killing of evil spirits. The last recorded event of this kind was in 1817. Another story suggests that the cats were brought into the Cloth Hall (\"Lakenhallen\") to control vermin. Before modern heating and storage methods, when it got cold the wool was stored in the upper floors of the Cloth Hall. At the start of the spring warm-up, after the wool had been sold, the cats were tossed out of the bell tower.\n\nSymbolically reviving this practice for the parade festivities, a jester tosses plush children's-toy cats from the Cloth Hall belfry down to the crowd, which awaits with outstretched arms to catch one. The throwing of the cats from the belfry is followed by a mock witch burning. Participants in the festivities often dress as cats, witches, mice, or townspeople from ages past, and the festival also features brass bands and people riding on horseback. Around 2,000 people participated in the 2012 parade. The festival is a popular tourist event in Belgium and has helped strengthen the local tourist economy around Ypres. 8,000 people visited the event in 2000.\n\n\n"}

Supporting characters are played by Paul Putner and Samantha Power (with Anthony Head and Ruth Jones in certain performances). As in the TV show, Tom Baker is the narrator, although his lines are pre-recorded. The show toured the United Kingdom from October 2005 until December 2006, and Australia from January–March 2007.\n\nIn an interview in the show's program, Lucas and Walliams state that they had always wanted \"Little Britain\" to be a radio programme, a television series and live stage show.\n\nAfter production of the third series of the television show, the duo settled down to write and plan the show. In rehearsals, the sketches were tweaked, re-ordered and re-written in order to accommodate the rapid costume and make-up changes required by the principal performers. To remove the need for stagehands to make set and prop changes, an elaborate stage floor was designed with track lines for the props. Sets were projected onto the background of the stage, with computer animated transitions designed by video and lighting designer Willie Williams.\n\nCertain sketches required elaborate technical mechanisms, such as the vomit machine for the Judy and Maggie \"Village Fete\" sketch, and oversized props for the Dennis Waterman sketch.\n\nDuring the show's UK run, several sketches were rewritten to improve the pacing, or removed in cases where the sketch was the same as the TV series.\n\nThe show's run began at the Portsmouth Guildhall in Portsmouth, Hampshire on 23 October 2005. The show toured for 49 performances in 18 cities: Bournemouth, Southend, Plymouth, Sheffield, Manchester, Nottingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool, Oxford, Bristol, Ipswich, Birmingham, Blackpool, Brighton and ending in Manchester on 20 December.\n\nLucas and Walliams took a month off, before resuming the UK tour and returning to the previously-toured cities. A month-long residency at the Hammersmith Apollo in London in October and November 2006 followed, with two shows at the Brixton Academy. There were 3 live shows in Ireland during the summer of 2006, shown at the Point Theatre in Dublin. The show was eventually seen by nearly one million people on its UK tour from November 2005 to December 2006. \"Little Britain Live\" toured Australia in early 2007. Initial bookings were made in Sydney, with other cities added as ticket sales soared. Eventually the show sold out six performances in Melbourne and Brisbane, seven in Sydney and Perth, and two in Adelaide. Performances were also held in Canberra, Newcastle and Wollongong.\n\n\n\n\nAnthony Head (as the Prime Minister) and Ruth Jones (as barmaid Myfanwy) reprised their roles for certain performances, also appearing as backup dancers during Daffyd's song. Head appeared in three performances in Birmingham (5–6 May, 9 December), two in Blackpool (8–9 May), during the show's London run, Cardiff (7 December), Melbourne (30 January – 2 February) and Sydney (3–5 February). Jones appeared in Blackpool (and hence on the DVD), Cardiff, and during the London run.\n\nA special version of the stage show featuring several celebrity guests was performed at the Hammersmith Apollo in London on 22 November 2006, and was shown by the BBC on 16 March 2007 as part of Comic Relief. Celebrity performers included Kate Moss as Vicky Pollard's sister Katie, Dawn French as lesbian barmaid Myfanwy, and the real Dennis Waterman who appeared to sing the \"Minder\" \"feem toon\" with his pint-sized counterpart. The show also featured cameo appearances from Russell Brand, Patsy Kensit, Kate Thornton and DJ Chris Moyles.\n\nSeveral sketches are adjusted to reflect local content, such as the locality referred to as a 'shithole' by travel agent Carol Beer (Preston in Blackpool, Bolton in Manchester, Wolverhampton or Chelmsley Wood in Birmingham, Derby in Nottingham, Strabane in Belfast, Shepherd's Bush in London, Broadmeadows in Melbourne, Elizabeth in Adelaide, Balga in Perth, Ipswich in Brisbane, Sunderland in Tyne and Wear, Dapto in Wollongong and Charnwood in Canberra), or retail outlets frequented by Vicky Pollard. In Australia, Lucas and Walliams were assisted by local comedians such as Gina Riley and Jane Turner (creators of \"Kath & Kim\") for Melbourne references and Andrew Denton for Sydney.\n\nThe Des Kaye and Marjorie Dawes sketches include audience participation, with members of the audience invited on-stage to take part in a game of 'Hide the Sausage' with Des, or participate in a 'weigh-in' with Marjorie.\n\n\nThe 9 May performance at the Blackpool Opera House was recorded and released on DVD in the UK (Region 2) and Australia (Region 4). The UK DVD was released on 13 November 2006 in a standard edition format and a special edition format (which included a miniature tour programme).\n\nAlso included on the DVD released in Australia (6 December 2006) and in the UK was 'Little Britain's Big Swim' which featured David Walliams swimming the English Channel.\n\nDaffyd Thomas's song \"I'm Gay\" was recorded in a studio and released as an Internet-only single on the UK and Australian iTunes Stores.\n\nThis is a night of \"Little Britain Live\" with celebrity guests such as Kate Moss and Peter Kay. £3 from each DVD sale goes to Comic Relief.

{"id": "35835612", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35835612", "title": "Murder of Krista Harrison", "text": "Murder of Krista Harrison\n\nThe murder of Krista Lea Harrison occurred on July 17, 1982, in Marshallville, Ohio. The case remained unsolved for two years, until Robert Anthony Buell was convicted of her murder in 1984. Harrison's case appeared on the fifth season of the American television show \"Forensic Files\" in an episode titled \"Material Evidence.\"\n\nEleven-year-old Krista Harrison (born May 28, 1971, Orrville, Ohio) had been picking up aluminum cans in the Marshallville park with one of her friends. The park was about one hundred yards from her home. It was reported by her friend that a man between 25 and 35 with shoulder-length hair drove up to Harrison in his van and forced her into the vehicle and drove away. Harrison's companion described the abductor's van to have been a brown or dark red color that had round windows on the sides, near the rear. After she was kidnapped, volunteers searched for her body across Marshallville to no avail. It was initially believed that the man would demand ransom for Krista's return, yet no contact was made.\n\nIt was not until six days later that her remains, which were in an advanced stage of decomposition, were discovered in the weeds a few feet off the side of a scarcely traveled road in adjacent Holmes County, Ohio. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted with a vibrator and a large plastic bag had been wrapped around her legs. Because of the condition of her remains, police were not able to identify the body until Harrison's father confirmed that it was his daughter. A Budweiser towel, a bloody car seat box, a wad of Harrison's hair, gloves, a plaid shirt and jeans were all found in the vicinity of the dump site. Examination of the remains indicated that the body was subjected to high temperatures, which was likely a consequence of her body remaining inside of the vehicle for a long period of time during summer weather. Harrison was buried in the Maple Grove Cemetery in Marshallville.\n\nOn Harrison's body and the towel near the scene, a distinct number of nutmeg or orange-colored polyester fibers were found. After they were examined under a microscope, investigators concluded that they were of trilobal shape and were likely from some type of carpet. Similar fibers were found on the body of Tina Harmon, a 12-year-old girl who was raped and murdered eight months earlier. A man had already been convicted on circumstantial evidence in her death and was incarcerated when Harrison was abducted. Authorities then began to consider that both girls were victims of the same person, as they were both sexually violated, strangled, and killed in the same county. The two also had the same sort of fibers on their remains, further linking the crimes.\n\nThe bag found wrapped around the lower half of Harrison's body was unique, as it had distinct folding patterns and thickness that occurred during the manufacturing process. The bag was traced to a factory in Pioneer, Ohio. Such bags were used for packaging a type of car seat, which was black in color. These seats, sold through Sears, were only available for a brief amount of time through mailing. The box containing Harrison's blood belonged to the same type of car seat. Sales records of the seats were subsequently examined from the store, to search for any Ohio resident who might purchased the seats. Twenty-three people in northern Ohio had purchased this type of car seat, but none owned a van that matched the one used during the abduction.\n\nAfter Harrison's body was found, a $10,000 reward was placed for information about the abductor, which showed composite sketches of the perpetrator. None was arrested until two years later. In 1984, 44-year-old Robert Anthony Buell, employed by the state of Ohio, kidnapped a 28-year-old woman while she was working as a manager at an Ohio gas station in Damascus, Ohio. The woman's head was shaved, she was shocked with a severed electrical cord, beaten and was bound to Buell's bed and raped. She was able to escape, twelve hours later, fearing for her life, and ran to a nearby house and notified police after her attacker had left to go to work. Such a man had previously preyed on Ohio women, who were usually in their late twenties to forties.\n\nPolice then compared the orange carpet fibers found on Harrison's body to the ones in Buell's van, which was the same color as the one seen in 1982. The rear-view windows were of a different shape, although it was later revealed that they had been replaced. It was later concluded that the fibers on Harrison's body and the carpet in the van were a likely match and records from Sears indicated that Buell had purchased the same type of car seat that was once contained in the bag and box used to conceal the body. Paint found on the jeans near the dump site matched that on the outside of Buell's residence as well. The jeans themselves were similar to other pairs that he owned. Spray paint in his garage was also matched to some that was present on the box. A fingerprint on plastic concealing Harrison's body did not.\n\nBuell pleaded no contest to the abduction and rape of the adult victim, yet he denied any involvement with Krista's murder. He was found guilty after being tried and sentenced to death in 1984; he was executed by lethal injection in 2002. He denied involvement and was never charged with the death of Tina Harmon, although dog hairs belonging to the remains of one found buried at his residence matched.\nIn 2010, DNA compared from the crime scene of Tina's murder to Buell's matched, therefore indicating that he was involved in her rape and most likely, her murder. Another victim who was murdered in 1983, Debora Kaye Smith, 10, had wax on her body that was from the same kind of candles that Buell owned. Her body was found over a month after her death, abandoned at the side of the Tuscarawas River.\n\nFormer journalist for the \"Cleveland Scene\" magazine, James Renner, has written through several of his works that Buell's nephew, Ralph Ross Jr., may have played a role in the murders, if not having been fully responsible. He has also connected the cases to that of the unsolved murders of 13-year-old Barbara Barnes and 10-year-old Amy Mihaljevic. Similar fibers on the latter victim's body were found.\n\n"}

The incident took place when a 13-year-old female, Nirmala Panta, left for her friend's house and was found murdered in a sugarcane field the next day. The forensic report proved that the girl was raped. The incident out broke nationwide protests which resulted in the deaths of some protestors.\n\nOn Thursday 26 July 2018, a ninth-grade schoolgirl Nirmala Panta of Bhimdattanagar-2, left her home for study in her friend Roshani Bam's house. MyRepublica explains that she went to the Bam's house, which was one and a half kilometers away from her home, around 11 a.m. and spent 3 hours there before she left around 3 p.m. afterward which she did not reach home. The relatives filed a complaint about a missing girl in the local police station but the police refused and instructed to come next morning. On Friday 27 July 2018, her dead body was found naked and placed on a one feet high waterlogged sugarcane field in Nimbukheda, Bhimdattanagar-18 about 500 meters far from Bam's house.\n\nThe local police identified Nirmala after her bicycle was found on the side of the road near the sugarcane farm. The local police stated that she was murdered after rape as per the preliminary report. CIB (Crime Investigation Bureau) team led by DSP Angur G.C. began the investigation on reaching Kanchanpur on four days after the incident. Kanchanpur Police and CIB team declared a mentally retarded man named \"Dilip Singh Bista\" as the culprit who was later proven innocent. According to the spokesperson of Nepal Police SSP Shailesh Thapa Kshetri, the DNA sample of Dilip Singh was found unmatched with the vaginal swab of the victim and thus was released on 12 September 2018. The local public including the victim's family believes that Dilip Singh was innocent and maliciously framed as chief culprit on 20 August 2018 by the Kanchanpur Police. Bam sisters; Babita Bam and Roshani Bam were arrested on 23 August 2018 on the speculation of local public while they were also released after the legal consultation with District Attorney Office together with Dilip Singh. Hari Prasad Mainali, Director General of Department of Prison Management, led a committee formed on 23 August 2018 by the Nepalese government to investigate the activities of Crime Investigation Bureau team and the Kanchanpur Police after they had reported a mentally retarded man as the perpetrator. Kanchanpur Police Chief SP Dilli Raj Bista and Chief District Officer Kumar Bahadur Khadka were suspended for mishandling of the case on Saturday 25 August 2018. and were replaced by new officials. The report of the Mainali Committee also resulted in the suspension of DSPs Gyan Bahadur Sethi and Angur GC, Inspectors Ekendra Khadka and Jagadish Bhatta and Assistant Sub-inspector Ram Singh Dhami by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Saturday. The police did not use the four sniffer dogs stationed at the provincial capital in Dhangadhi which locals consider to be a sheer negligence of the police. On Monday 17 September 2018, nine police officials were interrogated for their connections in the investigation of the case which included Kanchanpur Police Chief SP Dili Raj Bista. However, Birendra K.C. quitted the Home Ministry investigation panel citing that the life threat was prevalent on him and his family from the group actively trying to undermine the investigation. As per spokesperson of Nepal Police SSP Shailesh Thapa Kshetri, the DNA sample of SP Bista, his son Kiran Bista and Aayush Bista, nephew of Mayor of Bhimdatta Surendra Bista have been taken together with the vaginal swab of the victim for further investigation. On 17 September 2018, a new investigation committee was set up by Nepal Police under DIG (Deputy Inspector General of Police) Dhiru Basnyat to overtake the former investigation committee led by SSP Uttam Subedi. On the same day, Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli asserted that the assurance put upon the local police led to the derailment of the investigation. He speculates that either the police have forged the investigation or had committed mistakes in the investigation. Panta couples traveled 35 hours bus journey to Kathmandu to draw the attention of the central government on the case. PM Oli assured Panta couples to prosecute and punish the guilty person irrespective of his money, power, post or influences. \n\nOn 18 September 2018, the Kanchanpur police chief SP Kuber Kathayat admitted that there is no concrete evidence till date and investigation was ongoing. The government had earlier set up investigation panel due to the destruction of evidence by the local investigating police after the discovery of the body of the victim. DIG Dhiru Basnyat who was appointed as the leading officer to a nine-member probe committee formed on 16 September 2018 for new investigation, stated to begin the investigation from a completely new perspective.\n\nThe brother of the victim, Laxmi Prasad Panta, asserted that the last rites will not be performed unless the perpetrators are punished, the victim's family are compensated and a police beat is established at Nimbukheda. On 12 September 2018 in a conversation with The Himalayan Times, Yagya Raj Panta, father of Nirmala Panta, spoke about the atrocities of local police and local authorities and their forceful exertions to cremate the dead body instead of full-fledged investigation. Yagya Raj Panta and his wife Durga Devi Panta, continuously believe that Babita Bam and Roshani Bam (friend of Nirmala) are prime suspects. He quoted: Nirmala's mother Durga Devi accused local police of destroying the evidence and misleading the investigation: The locals continuously believe that Dilip Singh Bista was framed by the police to hide the real culprits. They demanded that the Nepal Army be investigated as an army barrack was near to the incident site.\n\nThe incident sparked public outrage and eventually broke social media which resulted in many public demonstrations. Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli in a meeting with the victim's parents and lawmakers of Province No. 7, gave an assurance of justice to the victim's parents. In the public demonstrations in the Bhimdattanagar, one boy has died in the clash against the police forces. The events of public protests are chronologically arranged:\n\n"}

{"id": "684628", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=684628", "title": "Parental alienation", "text": "Parental alienation\n\nParental alienation is the process, and the result, of psychological manipulation of a child into showing unwarranted fear, disrespect or hostility towards a parent and/or other family members. It is a distinctive form of psychological abuse, towards both the child and the rejected family members, that occurs almost exclusively in association with family separation or divorce, particularly where legal action is involved. It undermines core principles of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Most commonly, the primary cause is a parent wishing to exclude another parent from the life of their child, but other family members or friends, as well as professionals involved with the family (including psychologists, lawyers and judges), may contribute significantly to the process. It often leads to the long-term, or even permanent, estrangement of a child from one parent and other family members and, as a particularly adverse childhood experience, results in significantly increased lifetime risks of both mental and physical illness.\n\nFirst described in 1976 as \"pathological alignment\", parental alienation refers to a situation in which a child unreasonably rejects a non-custodial parent. Richard A. Gardner proposed parental alienation syndrome in the 1980s based on his clinical experience with the children of divorcing parents. Parental alienation lacks a single definition and its existence, cause and characteristics have been the subject of debate. Gardner's concept of a syndrome has failed to gain acceptance. Some empirical research has been performed, though the quality of the studies vary widely and research in the area is still developing.\n\nA survey of literature suggests that alienating behaviors by both parents are common in high-conflict divorces. Rejected parents tend to lose a sense of warmth and empathy with the child. As a result, the rejected parent may become passive, depressed, anxious, and withdrawn – characteristics that may encourage further rejection. The parent that the child aligns with (the aligned parent) may engage in alienating behaviors, including undermining the other parent. These behaviors may be conscious and deliberate or may reflect a lack of awareness on the effect of the actions on the children. Direct alienating behaviors occur when one parent actively undermines the other parent, such as making derogatory remarks about the other parent, telling the child that the other parent is responsible for the separation, or telling the child that the other parent is the cause of financial difficulties. Indirect alienation behaviors occur when one parent fails to support access or contact with the other parent or tacitly accepts the child's negative behaviour and comments towards the other parent.\n\nThe causes of alienation can be divided into two broad categories,\nRealistic estrangement is a different phenomenon from \"pathological alienation\". The former is an understandable refusal by a child to see an abusive parent, while the latter is emotionally harmful and unjustified.\n\nSymptoms associated with parental alienation include:\n\nSome researchers emphasized the role of an alienating parent, termed variously the \"programming\" parent or \"embittered-chaotic parent\", while other researchers have focused on the \"alienated child\", and the relationship dynamics that contribute to the alienation.\n\nWithin the context of relationship dynamics, alienation is seen as a breakdown of attachment between parent and child that may be caused by a variety factors. These researchers have proposed a more complex analysis, in which all family members may play a role in the alienation. This \"systems-based\" view acknowledges that a child may be alienated from one parent with no alienation programming from the other parent. The behaviors of all family members, including those of the alienated parent, may lead to family dysfunction and the rejection of a parent. Under this approach, when a child is estranged from a parent it is necessary to evaluate all contributing factors and all possible remedies to the estrangement.\n\nIn one conception of parental alienation, driven by a specific parent, a parent who experienced feelings of inadequacy or abandonment in their childhood can have those feelings re-triggered by a divorce or breakup. In response, that parent can reenact a false narrative related to their own childhood, where the child's other parent symbolizes an inadequate or abusive parent, the child symbolizes a victim of the other parent, and the parent using harmful parenting practices symbolizes a good parent ostensibly trying to protect their child. The role of the bystander such as friends, therapists, and judges is to confirm the delusion for the parent, which was already partially confirmed for them by the child acting like a victim However, in reality, the other parent is neither inadequate nor abusive; rather, the parent using the harmful parenting practices is abusive. In effect, the parent who fears inadequacy or abandonment is able to project their fears onto the other parent because \"all can plainly see\" that it is the other parent who is rejected and abandoned by the child and who is \"inadequate\".\n\nA parent who uses harmful parenting practices may suffer from borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder,\nrelated to an experience of feeling inadequate or abandoned while growing up. This feeling can be re-triggered by a divorce or breakup, causing them to decompensate into persecutory delusions.\nThese parents may believe that they do not need to follow social norms of fairness, and they may\n\"parentify their own children\", \"excessively bind their children to themselves\",\n\"demand absolute, unlimited control over their children while threatening rejection\",\nproject their own fears onto the other parent, abandon their spouse in favor of their children, and revive their own childhood attachment trauma after a difficult experience.\n\nThe techniques of harmful parenting may be subtle and \"genuine\". A parent can triangulate the child into the marital conflict\nby encouraging the child to make even minor complaints about the other parent and then \"enthusiastically validating\" them. This signals to the child that the other parent is dangerous\nand insensitive. This encouragement to complain manipulates the child into the role of victim without the child's awareness, allowing the parent to move into the protector role, forcing the other parent into the \"inadequate\" parent role, and leaving no trace of what happened for bystanders who only see the child acting as a \"victim\". Over time, the combined effects of growing closer to the alienating parent through this complaining process and growing further from the rejected parent as the result of focusing on negative things about the other parent cause the child to reject their other parent as being inadequate.\n\nA parent may also mix in lies, partial lies, and exaggerations, particularly ones that the child may not be able to verify or where only the true part of the partial lie is easy to verify. As the result of being encouraged to act as judge of their rejected parent, the child then feels superior to their rejected parent, leading to the symptoms of grandiosity, entitlement, and haughty arrogance. This feeds the delusion of the parent, that they are protecting the child from an inadequate parent. The child then begins to adopt this delusion also.\n\nBecause the child and parent are from different generations, this qualifies as a perverse triangle,\nfurther complicated by enmeshment, and made even worse because a member of the perverse triangle has a personality disorder, climaxed by the splitting dynamic of the parent with the personality disorder that requires the ex-spouse to also become the ex-parent of the child. Finally, the child may be led to misinterpret the grief they experience from the loss of a parent as pain that means the rejected parent is abusive, since they mainly experience it in the presence of the rejected parent.\n\nThe success of restoring the child's attachment to their parent hinges on first protecting the child from harmful parenting. A study suggests that the child does not experience this protection as being traumatic.\n\nAccording to one theory, when symptoms of alienation are present, structured intervention is likely to be more effective than traditional counseling. Structured intervention involves:\n\nAdvocates of structured intervention argue that traditional counseling, based on the therapeutic alliance, is susceptible to:\n\nSome have discussed a different approach for severe cases that defines a set of psychological symptoms in a child and proposes a psychological explanation for how those symptoms were caused by harmful parenting practices and why a parent would employ those parenting practices. In this approach, the phenomenon is seen simply as a combination of psychological problems, each of which psychologists understand and recognize.\nAccording to this theoretical formulation, \"the pathology traditionally called ‘parental alienation' are manifestations of well-established forms of existing pathologies.”\n\nThe history of parental alienation reflects an evolution of its acceptance by professionals involved in custody cases. A 2009 survey of mental health and legal professionals found broad skepticism of the concept of parental alienation syndrome, and caution in relation to the concept of parental alienation.\n\nMental health professionals are reluctant to recognize so-called parental alienation syndrome. In the past, the American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association have held a neutral view of parental alienation as a distinct syndrome.\n\nIn anticipation of the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which was released in 2013, William Bernet argued for the inclusion of \"parental alienation disorder\", a diagnosis related to parental alienation. His conception makes reference to parental alienation and a variety of other descriptions of behaviors he believes represent the underlying concept of parental alienation disorder. Despite lobbying by proponents, in December 2012, the proposal was rejected.\n\nSome argue that elements of parental alienation are covered in the DSM-5 under the diagnosis: \"Parent-Child Relational Problem\". For example, the child's perception of an alienated parent \"may include negative attributions of the other's intentions, hostility toward or scapegoating of the other (parent), and unwarranted feelings of estrangement\".\n\nIn a survey at the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts in 2010, 98% of the 300 respondents agreed with the question, \"Do you think that some children are manipulated by one parent to irrationally and unjustifiably reject the other parent?\". However, parental alienation refers not to the acts of manipulation, but rather to the child's rejection of a parent that results from alienating behavior.\n\nSome courts recognize parental alienation as a form of child abuse with long-term effects and serious outcomes for the child. Some jurisdictions, including Brazil and Mexico, have enacted parental alienation as a criminal offense. Other jurisdictions may suspend child support in cases where parental alienation occurs. For example, in New York, in \"Matter of Robert Coull v. Pamela Rottman\", No. 2014-01516, 2015 N.Y. App. Div. LEXIS 6611 (September 2, 2015), where the father was prevented from seeing his son by the child's mother through a \"pattern of alienation\", child support was suspended. Some United States courts have also tried to address the issue through mandated reunification therapy; but no federal or state laws regulating parental alienation currently exist in the United States Due to the nature of allegations of parental alienation, many courts require that a qualified expert witness testify in support of allegations of parental alienation or in association with any allegation that a parent has a mental health disorder.\n\nWhile states have broadly rejected parental alienation syndrome as a concept that may be presented in a child custody case, it remains possible to argue that parental alienation has occurred, and to demonstrate how a parent's alienating behaviors should be considered by a court when evaluating a custody case. Behaviors that result in parental alienation may reflect other mental health disorders, both on the part of the alienating parent and the alienated parent, that may be relevant to a custody determination. The behavior of the alienated child may also be a relevant factor.\n\n\n"}

It tells the story of Addison Mizner and his brother Wilson Mizner's adventures across America from the beginning of the 20th century during the Klondike gold rush to the Florida real estate boom of the 1920s.\n\nAfter a 1999 workshop in New York City, the musical was produced in Chicago and Washington, D.C. in 2003 under the title \"Bounce\", but it did not achieve much success. A revised version of the musical premiered Off-Broadway in New York in October 2008.\n\nThe musical takes considerable liberties with the facts of Addison's and Wilson's lives.\n\nThe musical premiered at the New York Theatre Workshop from October through November 1999 under the title \"Wise Guys\". It was directed by Sam Mendes and starred Nathan Lane and Victor Garber as brothers Addison Mizner and Wilson Mizner. A legal case involving Scott Rudin and Weidman and Sondheim held up further production.\n\nSubstantially rewritten and retitled \"Bounce\", the show opened on June 20, 2003 at the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. The production was directed by Harold Prince, with choreography by Michael Arnold, set design by Eugene Lee, costume design by Miguel Angel Huidor, lighting design by Howell Binkley, and hair design by David H. Lawrence. The cast starred Richard Kind (Addison Mizner), Howard McGillin (Wilson Mizner), Jane Powell (Mama Mizner), Herndon Lackey (Papa Mizner/Businessman/Englishman/Plantation Owner/Armstrong/Real Estate Owner), Gavin Creel (Hollis Bessemer), and Michele Pawk (Nellie).\n\nThe musical then ran at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in October and November 2003 with the Chicago cast. It received mixed–to–negative reviews and was not produced in New York. A private reading of \"Bounce\" was held at the Public Theater on February 6, 2006. \"Playbill\" reported that Eric Schaeffer directed, with Richard Kind and Bernadette Peters among the cast.\n\nA new production of the musical, titled \"Road Show\", rewritten without an intermission and without the leading female character of Nellie (who had been added for 2003 production), opened Off-Broadway at The Public Theater's Newman Theater in previews on October 28, 2008, officially opening on November 18, and closing December 28, 2008. John Doyle was the director and designer, with Michael Cerveris and Alexander Gemignani playing brothers Wilson and Addison Mizner respectively, Alma Cuervo as Mama, Claybourne Elder as Hollis, and William Parry as Papa. This production won the 2009 Obie Award for Music and Lyrics. and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Lyrics (Sondheim).\n\nThe title changes reflect the creators' attempts to hone the show's story and themes. \"Ideally the title is connected to what we hope the show is about,\" Weidman says.\n\nThe musical opened at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London in previews on June 24, 2011, officially on July 6 and closed on September 18. John Doyle was the director and designer, with a cast featuring Michael Jibson, David Bedella and Jon Robyns.\n\nThe US regional premier opened at Stages Repertory Theater in Houston, Texas on May 22, 2013, directed by Kenn McLaughlin. The cast featured Tom Frey and L. Jay Meyer, playing Wilson and Addison Mizner, respectively, along with Susan Shofner as Mama, Jimmy Phillips as Papa, and Michael McClure as Hollis. Rounding out the cast were Cameron Bautsch, Bridget Bierne, Hunter Frederick, Sarah Myers, Amanda Parker, Amanda Passanante, Tom Prior and Brandon Whitley.\n\nA Chicago version opened at the Chicago Shakespeare Theatre on March 13, 2014, starring Andrew Rothenberg as Wilson and Michael Aaron Lidner as Addison.\n\nThe New England premiere of \"Road Show\" ran from January 12 to February 11, 2018 at The Lyric Stage Company of Boston in Boston, MA.\n\nIn the workshop, titled \"Wise Guys,\" the show was framed as a vaudeville act, with Wilson and Addison opening the show with the title song, in the style of vaudeville comics, a theme that recurred over the show. There was an additional song for Mama Mizner called 'Brothers,' and a song for Wilson titled 'Stay Right Where You Are' in which he seduces his future wife. Addison had a song in Act II sung to a sick Wilson called \"Make it Through the Night.\" This version dealt with Addison's real-life business partner Paris Singer. However, the writers soon decided to deal more openly with Addison's sexuality, and since Singer was heterosexual, Sondheim and Weidman invented the character of Hollis Bessemer. The vaudeville concept was eventually dropped.\n\nIn the later stage version titled \"Bounce,\" the character of Wilson's wife was developed into a secondary lead called Nellie. Wilson first meets her in a saloon in Alaska, where she seduces him with the song \"What's Your Rush?\" They re-encounter each other in New York, Nellie having become rich on the brothers' gold claim, and they marry after the song 'The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened.' She divorces him when his enterprises interfere with their love life. The brothers meet her again in Florida, where she joins in the Boca Raton scheme. After this fails, she leaves with Hollis to find her next opportunity. In \"Road Show\", her character was again reduced to Wilson's marriage to her in Act I.\n\nFor the \"Road Show\" version, Sondheim rewrote the opening number \"Bounce\" as \"Waste,\" to reflect a darker tone. He added an additional song, \"Brotherly Love,\" for the Mizners, and rewrote \"The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened\" as a duet for Addison and Hollis.\n\nAfter the 1933 death of Addison Mizner, people who knew him, including his estranged lover Hollis Bessemer, comment on his life and the way he squandered his talents (\"Waste\"). Addison's younger brother Wilson appears and speaks to Addison, who angrily claims that Wilson was the cause of all his failures. The time shifts to Papa Mizner's death in California at the beginning of the 20th century. On his deathbed, Papa charges his sons with the task of using their gifts to shape America (\"It's In Your Hands Now\"), telling them that there's a \"road\" to follow. Mama Mizner reveals the family's wealth has been eaten away by Papa's long illness and advises the boys to seek gold in Alaska; Addison is reluctant, but goes along with Wilson anyway (\"Gold!\").\n\nIn the Klondike, the brothers share a sleeping bag and reminisce about their childhood (\"Brotherly Love\"). Wilson leaves to get supplies while Addison works the claim. Wilson is lured into a game of poker. Addison is shocked to discover his brother gambling. Wilson explains his newfound love of taking risks regardless of what's at stake (\"The Game\"). Wilson stakes their gold claim in a poker game and wins the saloon in which the game is taking place. (This episode is fictitious.) A shade of Papa Mizner appears and tells Addison that this was not what he had in mind for his sons.\n\nAddison leaves in disgust with his share of Wilson's winnings and travels around the world searching for business opportunities and a sense of purpose (\"Addison's Trip\"). All of his ventures fail due to bad luck. He is left with nothing but souvenirs that inspire him to take up architecture (so he can design a house in which to show them off). Wilson's businesses in Alaska also have failed, so he comes south to seek his brother's help. Wilson seduces and marries Addison's first client, a rich widow, and fritters away her money on various flashy endeavours, including fixed boxing matches and horse races (\"That Was A Year\").\n\nAlthough Wilson's various partners lose money, they remain fond of him because of the verve and energy with which he lives. Even Mama Mizner, who is being looked after by Addison and never receives any visits from Wilson, enjoys reading about Wilson's exploits, saying that she can live through him (\"Isn't He Something!\"). Only Addison remains uncharmed by Wilson, and when Wilson finally comes back, his resources exhausted, he finds that Mama has died in his absence. Addison angrily throws Wilson out of the house.\n\nLearning of rising property interests in Florida (\"Land Boom!\"), Addison decides to travel to Palm Beach to take advantage of the many rich people settling there who need houses built. (In reality, Mizner went there for his health.) On the train he meets the fictitious Hollis Bessemer, with whom he is instantly smitten. Hollis is the son of a wealthy industrialist, cut off by his father for refusing to enter the family business. His real passion is art, and although he is not himself talented, he dreams of creating an artists' colony in Palm Beach with the help of his aunt, who is staying there in a hotel (\"Talent\").\n\nAddison shows Hollis's aunt a plan for a house he proposes to build for her. Impressed, she agrees and offers to sponsor Hollis's artists' colony. However, Hollis and Addison, now lovers, are too busy designing resort homes for the rich (\"You\") and enjoying each other's company (\"The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened\") to follow up on Hollis's original plan. Wilson arrives at Hollis's and Addison's house, destitute and sick (\"The Game [Reprise]\"). Addison reluctantly takes him in, and when Wilson has recovered, he begins to work on Hollis, persuading him to be a patron to his newest scheme: to build a brand new city in Boca Raton with Wilson as promoter and Addison as chief architect (\"Addison's City\").\n\nWilson's con man instincts resurface. He promotes the Boca Raton real estate scheme with increasingly extravagant and eventually fraudulent claims, creating a price bubble (\"Boca Raton\"). Addison goes along, until it is Hollis who finally puts a stop to the real-estate scheme. He asks Addison choose between Wilson and him. Addison, brought to a state of desperation, drives Hollis away by claiming he never loved him. Addison also orders Wilson out of his life (\"Get Out\"), but Wilson insists Addison loves him too much (\"Go\"). Addison agrees, but still wants him to go. Wilson leaves for good.\n\nBut not quite, for in the finale (returning to the first scene) all the characters leave the stage except for Wilson and Addison. At this point, Wilson realises that he, too, has died. The brothers bicker half-heartedly, their differences no longer mattering enough to keep them apart. Confronted by their father, they shrug off his criticisms and the brothers set out together on the road to eternity—or, as Wilson calls it, \"the greatest opportunity of all.\" \"Sooner or later,\" he says, \"we're bound to get it right.\"\n\nThe musical is sometimes taken as a faithful portrayal of the two brothers' lives. This is not quite the case. While Addison was an architect and Wilson a con man, among other things, Hollis Bessemer is fictitious; he has some similarities to Addison's friend Paris Singer, but Singer was not a homosexual and certainly not Addison's lover. Addison's homosexuality, while no secret, was at the time kept much quieter than it is in the musical; he never had a \"lover\". Wilson's role in the Boca Raton fiasco is exaggerated, and while he did marry a rich widow, who quickly divorced him, she had not been a client of Addison. Addison never blamed Wilson for all his problems. Mama Mizner was not behind the boys' gold mining. While Addison did travel considerably, it was not around the world, and it was not the case that part of it was a string of businesses. Addison's alleged decisión to become an architect so as to build a house for his souvenirs is colorful, but fictitious.\n\n\n\n§ In Chicago production, not in Kennedy Center\n\n\nReferring to the 2003 \"Bounce\" productions, theatertermania.com wrote, \"A brace of mixed-to-negative reviews has all but assured that this production of Bounce will not be coming to New York.\" The \"New York Times\" noted in an article in November 2003 that \"the show, which received lukewarm reviews in two tryout runs, is not coming to Broadway anytime soon.\"\n\nBen Brantley, in his \"New York Times\" review of the 2003 Kennedy Center production, said \"[It] never seems to leave its starting point...Mr. Kind and Mr. McGillin execute this self-introduction [title song] charmingly, translating wryness and ruefulness into a breezy soft-shoe sensibility. But in a sense, when they have finished the song they have already delivered the whole show...\"Bounce,\" which features the vibrant Michele Pawk as a zestful gold digger (of both Klondike and jazz-age varieties) and Jane Powell as the Mizners' mother, only rarely kicks into a higher gear than the one that gently propels the opening duet...their trajectory feels as straight and flat as a time line in a history book. The bounce in \"Bounce\" is never very high...Much of the music, while whispering of earlier, more flashily complex Sondheim scores, has a conventional surface perkiness that suggests a more old-fashioned, crowd-pleasing kind of show than is this composer's wont. But his extraordinary gift for stealthily weaving dark motifs into a brighter musical fabric is definitely in evidence, mellifluously rendered in the peerless Jonathan Tunick's orchestrations.\"\n\nBrantley, in his review of the 2008 production, praised Ceveris and Gemignani, but declares that, \"The problem is that this musical’s travelogue structure precludes its digging deep. It hints at dark and shimmering glories beneath the surface that it never fully mines. Like its leading characters, 'Road Show' doesn’t quite know what to do with the riches at its disposal.\"\n\nAn original cast recording of the 2003 version (then titled \"Bounce\") was released on May 4, 2004 by Nonesuch Records.\n\nAn original cast recording of the 2008 Public Theater production was made by PS Classics and Nonesuch Records, and was released on June 30, 2009.\n\n"}
{"id": "1052199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1052199", "title": "Similarity (psychology)", "text": "Similarity (psychology)\n\nSimilarity refers to the psychological nearness or proximity of two mental representations. Research in cognitive psychology has taken a number of approaches to the concept of similarity. Each of them is related to a particular set of assumptions about knowledge representation.\n\nMental distance approaches assume that mental representations can be conceptualized as some kind of mental space. Concepts are represented as points within the space. Similarity between concepts is a function of the distance between the concepts in space. Concepts represented by points that are near to each other are more psychologically similar than are points that are conceptually distant. A strength of this approach is there are many mathematical techniques for deriving spaces from data such as multidimensional scaling and latent semantic analysis .\n\nFeatural approaches were developed to address limitations of the mental distance approaches. For example, spaces are symmetric. The distance between two points is the same regardless of which point you start from. However, psychological similarity is not symmetric. For example, we often prefer to state similarity in one direction. For example, it feels more natural to say that 101 is like 100 than to say that 100 is like 101. Furthermore, many metaphors are also directional. Saying \"That surgeon is a butcher\" means something quite different from saying \"That butcher is a surgeon.\"\n\nFeatural approaches assumed that people represent concepts by lists of features that describe properties of the items. A similarity comparison involves comparing the feature lists that represent the concepts. Features that are shared in the feature lists are \"commonalities\" of the pair and features that are contained in one feature set but not the other are \"differences\" of the pair. It is possible to account for people's intuitions or ratings of the similarities between concepts by assuming that judgments of similarity increase with the number of commonalities (weighted by the salience of those commonalities) and decreases with the number of differences (weighted by the salience of the differences).\n\nStructural approaches to similarity were developed to address limitations of the featural account. In particular, featural approaches assume that the commonalities and differences are independent of each other. However, commonalities and differences are not psychologically independent. In fact, determining the differences between a pair requires finding the commonalities. Consider the comparison between a car and a motorcycle. Both have wheels. That is a commonality. However, cars have four wheels, while motorcycles have two wheels. That is a difference. Because this difference required first finding a commonality between the pair, it is called an \"alignable difference\". Alignable differences contrast with \"nonalignable differences\" which are aspects of one concept that have no correspondence in the other. For example, cars have seatbelts and motorcycles do not. Research suggests that alignable differences have a larger impact on people's judgments of similarity than do nonalignable differences. Thus, the relationship between the commonalities of a pair and the differences is important for understanding people's assessments of similarity. Structural approaches to similarity emerged from research on analogy.\n\nTransformational accounts of similarity were developed to evaluate similarity independently of the type of mental representation. On this view, any mental representation can be transformed into another mental representation through some series of steps. For any representation system and set of transformations, it is possible to define the shortest set of steps (i.e., the shortest program) that will transform one representation into another. The shorter this minimal program, the more similarity the pair of concepts. found some evidence against this view, showing that the number of steps to transform the colors and shapes of geometric objects does not predict people's similarity judgments for those objects.\n\nIn social psychology, \"similarity\" refers to how closely attitudes, values, interests and personality match between people. Research has consistently shown that similarity leads to interpersonal attraction.\n\nMany forms of similarity have been shown to increase liking. Similarities in opinions, interpersonal styles, amount of communication skill, demographics, and values have all been shown in experiments to increase liking.\n\nSeveral explanations have been offered to explain similarity increases interpersonal attraction (like-prefers-like). First, people with similar interests tend to put themselves into similar types of settings. For example, two people interested in literature are likely to run into each other in the library and form a relationship (involving the propinquity effect). Another explanation is that we notice similar people, expect them to like us, and initiate relationships. Also, having relationships with similar people helps to validate the values held in common. Finally, people tend to make negative assumptions about those who disagree with them on fundamental issues, and hence feel repulsion.\n\n\n"}

Horton released this song through Columbia Records in 1960, when it reached #3 on the charts.

OSMTH is often referred to simply as the Knights Templars but asserts no direct lineage to the original Order.\n\nOSMTH does not officially recognize the claims laid out in the Larmenius Charter as historically valid, but makes a moral and ethical claim to follow in the same spiritual path as the original Order of the Knights Templar.\n\nOSMTH, which is open to Christians of any denomination, operates as a charity, and engages in diplomatic and humanitarian works.\n\nThe self-styled \"l'Ordre du Temple\", founded in France in 1705, claimed to be the continuation of the medieval Knights Templar, using the Larmenius Charter as evidence of its pedigree. The order was officially reconstituted in 1804 by Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat, and recognized as an Order of Chivalry by its patron Napoleon Bonaparte in 1805; In 1945, Antonio Campello Pinto de Sousa Fontes (1878-1960) claimed that the OSMTH was the continuation of \"l'Ordre du Temple\", Fernando Campello Pinto Pereira de Sousa Fontes (b. 1930) succeeded his father as the head of the order in 1960.\n\nIn 1970, a split occurred within the OSMTH when General Antoine Zdrojewski was unexpectedly elected as the new Grand Master of the OSMTH at the Convent of Paris in September, 1970. Zdrojewski became the head of one faction of the Order, which he referred to by the French translation: \"Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem\" (OSMTJ), until his death in 1989. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ International Leader today.\n\nIn 1997, OSMTH voted to expel Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes from the order. This resulted in another schism with those loyal to Grand Master Fernando de Sousa Fontes forming a new organization presently known as OSMTH-Regency while the remainder of the organization continued on as OSMTH.\n\nWhile OSMTH rituals and traditions are currently based upon those of the historical Knights Templar, according to its website and their present leader, Grand Master Patrick Rea, there is no direct historical lineage claimed by OSMTH and the 12th century Templars.\n\nIn 2001, the Order was accredited by the United Nations Economic and Social Council as a non-governmental organisation, in special consultative status, one of over 2,000 organizations to hold this status. The Order is an associate member of the International Peace Bureau and an affiliate of the International Center for Religion & Diplomacy, which was founded by one of OSMTH's members. In 2014, OSMTH was elected as a board member of CoNGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative status with the United Nations.\n\nThe order exists in each country under different jurisdictions. In America, the OSMTH is known as the \"Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, Inc (this being the English rendering of the Latin name).\" They should not be confused with a multitude of other self-styled \"Knights Templar\", or the Masonic Knights Templar.\n\nOSMTH is registered in Geneva, Swiss Reg No: CH-660.1.972777-4 and is in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations has over 5000 active members in Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, England & Wales, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, Serbia, Ukraine and in the United States. OSMTH operates in a number of countries providing humanitarian aid such as the River Jordan Project that is supported by HM King Abdullah of Jordan.\n\nThe ecumenical organization operates as a modern-day network of educated professionals. As of August 2007, the organization had approximately 5,200 members.\n\nChristian men who join the organisation are self-styled as \"Knights\" with the title of \"Chevalier\" and females are termed \"Dames\" with the title of \"Chevaleresse\" (or \"Chevalière\"). The modern Order claims over 5000 members, allegedly including leaders in the military, business, government and ecclesiastical communities.\n\nThe Order's Royal Patron, who is also a Chevalière of the Order, is Her Highness Princess Elizabeth of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach (b. 1945). She is the widow of HSH Prince Ferdinand Heinrich of Ysenburg-Büdingen-Wachtersbach and the eldest daughter of Prince Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (1913-1989). She is also the great (4) granddaughter of King Frederick V of Denmark.\n\nThe Religious Patron is H.E. Archbishop Dr. Vicken Aykazain, Legate of the Eastern Diocese Armenian, Orthodox Church of America. \n\nThe Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) is the American autonomous Grand Priory of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH). branch of the Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani. The SMOTJ broke with the OSMTH-Regency in 1995 when it refused to recognize the sovereignty of OSMTH-Regency Grand Master Dom Fernando de Sousa Fontes. \n\nThis name Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ) has been trademarked and is used exclusively in America by the SMOTJ and thus does not refer to the group of organizations tracing lineage to OSMTH but rather to the current OSMTH only.\n\nThe OSMTJ is split of OSMTH in 1970 after the former Grandmaster Fontes refused to obey the laws of succession when General Antoine Zdrojewski was elected. Some of the Grand Priories, including the French, Belgian, Swiss, and Polish, followed the newly elected General Zdrojewski, and some stayed loyal to Fontes.  Alfred Zappelli (Grand Prior of Switzerland), General Georges de Bruyn (Grand Prior of Belgium), and Badouraly-Somji Alibay (Commander of the Polish Commandery)  were also backers of General Zdrojewski.  After the election of Zdrojewski, those who followed him became known as OSMTJ.  Those who continued to follow de Sousa Fontes were known as OSMTH (or “OSMTH-Regency”).  “OSMTJ” is the French acronym  for  “Ordre Souverain et Militaire du Temple de Jérusalem.” \n\nIn late 1973, Grand Master Zdrojewski carried out a re-organization of the OSMTJ and a reform of the Statutes. He approved the Grand Priories re-asserting the independence of the International Federation of Autonomous Grand Priories of the OSMTJ (Each member Grand Priory was recognized as autonomous). The Swiss Grand Priory accepted these reformed statutes in 1973, while the Belgian and United States Grand Priories accepted them in 1975. Zdrojewski was succeeded by George Lamirand as the new head of the OSMTJ until his death in 1994. George Lamirand was succeeded by Dr. Nicolas Haimovici Hastier who is the current OSMTJ Regent today.\nToday H.E.Domizio CIPRIANI Grand Prior of Principality of Monaco, take the fonction of General Chancellor of the order in place of General Ronald Magnum. The General Chancellor work with the Regency Council at directly with the Regent General Ph.D Nicolas Hastier Haimovici for develop the Academy of study and coordination of humanitarian actions. \nThe United States Grand Priory of OSMTJ is also known as the OSMTJ Knights Templar of America.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5334461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5334461", "title": "Strawberry Fair", "text": "Strawberry Fair\n\nStrawberry Fair is a local festival of music, entertainments, arts and crafts which has been held in Cambridge, England, since 1974. The fair is held on Midsummer Common on the first Saturday in June. It is open to the public and free.\n\nIt has been held since 1974 except 2010, when it was cancelled due to drunkenness and drug use. A year later, the fair continued with a perimeter fence erected around the festival and searches to check for alcohol, drugs and weapons.\n\nThe 2011 parade was part of the UK Centre for Carnival Arts 'Carnival Crossroads' project and featured colourful costumes and samba bands. There was a Village Green area with traditional community activities such as re-enactment displays, It's A Knockout, fancy dress pageant and a grand finale. Other attractions were the Wigwam Stage, The Green Area, Kids Area, the acoustic and cabaret bar, and Colonel Maybey's Mechanical Menagerie a new 'steam diesel punk' area, in addition to around 300 stalls selling food and goods. Entry to the fair was free. As in recent years (since 2004) the fair held a free 'film night' the previous day featuring short films made by local people. The fair has a following of alternative lifestyles.\n\nA range of musical genres are represented at the fair across several music stages. Local bands are predominantly selected to play. Children are catered for with a free and enclosed entertainments area that includes face painters, a family friendly cafe, a marquee of activities such as painting and crafts, storytelling and other attractions. An Arts area also allows local art to be displayed and for visitors to the fair to try something new.\n\nCurrent music stages found on the official website under Areas and Events\n\nIn the constitution, the object of the fair is described thus:\n\nThe fair is run by a committee of local people who elect a Chair, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, and Secretary each year in September/October to form a Steering Group. Sub-committees also operate in order to discuss specific areas of the fair's operation, namely Programming, Finance and Admin, Policy and Community, and Site. The heads of these sub-committees report back at monthly General Meetings - weekly closer to the fair - which provides accountability and allows for the approval (or otherwise) of proposals put forward by the sub-committees.\n\nApproximately 1000 people volunteer their time to make Strawberry Fair happen, which is seen by the committee as one of its greatest aspects. These volunteers include members of the committee itself, stewards, an environment team, area coordinators, stage managers, backstage staff, stalls co-ordinators, and many people 'behind the scenes' who undertake administration.\n\nThe fair is a free event because of volunteers. Income from stalls meets infrastructure and overhead costs. Benefit gigs are held throughout the year to raise money (for example, Strawberry Sundae). The local bands that play these gigs usually also play on the day of the fair. Strawberry Fair also organise and run the Cambridge Band Competition which has been running since 1984. Heats are held each year in The Portland Arms music venue, with the final at Cambridge Junction. All finalists in the Cambridge Band Competition also get invited to play at the Fair. \n\nStrawberry Fair merchandise - including T-shirts, badges, programmes and posters - is also sold from Information Tents on Fair days and at benefit and band competition heats and final.\n\n\n"}

In June 2012, FunnyJunk's lawyer, Charles Carreon, sent Inman a letter demanding US$20,000 in damages from him, alleging the claims he made were defamatory. Inman responded by publishing the letter on his site, along with a response and announcement that he would be organizing a charity fundraiser through Indiegogo, donating the amount demanded by Carreon to the American Cancer Society and the National Wildlife Federation.\n\nOn June 15, 2012, Carreon filed a separate pro se lawsuit \"Carreon vs Inman et al\" against Inman, Indiegogo, both charities and a hundred Does for allegations related to \"The Oatmeal\"s response and related actions by other individuals. Carreon dropped this case on July 3 of that year. \"Mashable\" named the case first among their list of \"silliest tech lawsuits ever.\" Carreon was also sued by the anonymous operator of a blog parodying him after Carreon sent letters to the site's web host demanding they reveal its operator.\n\nFunnyJunk is a website where users can upload content they find humorous. According to \"Ars Technica\", key FunnyJunk personnel are Bryan Durel and Benjamin Bunker.\n\nIn 2010, \"The Oatmeal\" creator Matthew Inman found that FunnyJunk was distributing copies of comics from his website without permission. He sent e-mails, resulting in removal of some but not all of the comics, and subsequently discontinued attempts at removal.\n\nIn May 2011, Inman made a post on \"The Oatmeal\"s blog against FunnyJunk and contemplating a cease and desist under the DMCA (see Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act). The FunnyJunk owner known simply as \"Admin\" responded with a message to all users claiming that “the Oatmeal wants to sue funnyjunk and shut it down! He thinks we're nothing more than dirty content thieves...Contact Oatmeal anyway you can!\" and provided links to \"The Oatmeal\"s e-mail and Facebook page. This triggered spamming by FunnyJunk users and a flame war with \"The Oatmeal\" readers.\n\nIn 2011/2012, FunnyJunk hired Charles Carreon to review its website. In June 2012, Carreon delivered a demand letter via process server to Matthew Inman of \"The Oatmeal\" claiming that \"The Oatmeal\"s posts regarding FunnyJunk's alleged copyright infringement constituted defamation. The letter demanded the removal of references to FunnyJunk and US$20,000 in damages. Inman responded with a \"The Oatmeal\" blog post containing an annotated copy of the letter, and refusing to do so. Inman further proposed to raise the requisite $20,000, take a photo of himself with the cash, and send the photograph along with a satirical illustration of FunnyJunk's mother \"seducing a Kodiak bear\" to FunnyJunk. Rather than pay the damages, Inman proposed to donate the money to two charities, the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society. This blog post elicited more popular support for Inman and \"The Oatmeal\" than anticipated, and the fundraising effort \"Operation BearLove Good. Cancer Bad.\" generated the $20,000 in 64 minutes and over $100,000 in under 24 hours, and at completion he raised $220,024. Inman also responded via counsel. On June 21, 2012, Carreon abandoned FunnyJunk's demands because of misinformation.\n\nThe incident spurred commentary by Dan Mitchell of \"SF Weekly\" on how the Digital Millennium Copyright Act places the onus of policing violations on content creators and by Maxwell S. Kennerly Esquire of the Beasley Firm LLC on whether public accusations of copyright infringement are defamatory.\n\nIn the aftermath of the blog post, FunnyJunk took down all pages Inman linked as infringement and Carreon sought to hide his e-mail address due to a flood of e-mail. Carreon expressed surprise, stating: \"I really did not expect that he would marshal an army of people who would besiege my website and send me a string of obscene emails.\" On June 14, 2012 Carreon replaced his contact page with one saying, \"Due to security attacks instigated by Matt Inman, this function has been temporarily disabled.\" Inman, however, disputed the assertion that he had instigated an attack, noting in a blog post that Carreon's contact information had been redacted from his initial comic and that he had never directed anyone to attack Carreon. Carreon's website, Twitter account and WordPress site were all attacked, but he says \"I welcome the opportunity to confront legally the misuse of a new technology.\" Carreon is trying to identify the operator of the impostor account @Charles_Carreon by subpoenaing Twitter and Ars Technica. As of September 2012, the account was suspended.\n\nCarreon sent Indiegogo a request to halt Inman's charity fundraiser as a terms of service violation, alleging that the charities' names are misrepresented in violation of California law, and Inman will profit. Inman promised, \"I won't use any of the money on legal fees.\" and \"100% of it is going to charity.\" Indiegogo investigated the allegations and did not suspend the campaign.\n\nWhen Operation BearLove Good, Cancer Bad ended, Matthew Inman said that he still plans to go with his plan of taking a picture of the money, sending it to Carreon with the satirical picture, and donating the money, though now both the National Wildlife Federation and the American Cancer Society get $105,611.52 each instead of $10,000 each. Inman negotiated to receive the sum in $20 bills from the bank. As of July 1, 2012 Inman has already withdrawn and photographed his own funds, posting the images on July 9. Glenn Fleishman participated in and reported the photo shoot. Inman sent FunnyJunk a framed print of the satirical drawing and a photo of the cash spelling out \"F. U.\"\n\nOn June 15, 2012, Carreon filed a \"pro se\" lawsuit \"Carreon v. Inman et al\" in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland against Inman, Indiegogo Inc., the American Cancer Society, the National Wildlife Federation and a hundred anonymous Internet users for allegations related to the \"Oatmeal\" case. In the filing, Carreon says he donated to the fundraiser, which would give him legal standing for his lawsuit. Carreon stated that he wants to prevent charity fraud like the donations from being diverted from NWF and ACS to Inman, Indiegogo or other undisclosed charities. Inman responded to the lawsuit with a blog post, but was advised against giving interviews.\n\nIndiegogo responded with a statement calling the lawsuit \"frivolous.\" Lawyer Rebecca E. Hoffman of Bloomberg BNA said Carreon's case could \"only be described as frivolity on top of frivolousness.\"\n\nOn June 21, 2012, the case of \"Carreon v. Inman et al\" was assigned to Judge Edward M. Chen. On the same day, the Electronic Frontier Foundation announced that it would represent Inman, stating, \"This lawsuit is a blatant attempt to abuse the legal process to punish a critic.\"\n\nOn June 25, Carreon amended his lawsuit against Inman and the other defendants to include Kamala Harris, the state Attorney General of California. On June 30, Carreon also requested a temporary restraining order to stop disbursement of the donations. On July 1, 2012 Inman's and Indiegogo's attorneys filed opposition. According to their filings, credit card donations held by Indiegogo were disbursed directly to the National Wildlife Foundation and the American Cancer Society on June 29 while donations via PayPal were held in a PayPal account. Inman wrote checks to the charities against the PayPal balance and gave them to his lawyer. Inman withdrew and photographed his own funds, posting the images on July 9.\n\nOn July 3, 2012, Carreon filed a notice of voluntary dismissal in his lawsuit against all parties without prejudice. Carreon declared, \"Mission Accomplished,\" in an interview with Ars Technica and told Comic Riffs, “Inman aborted his ‘publicity stunt’ to photograph himself with the proceeds that were intended to go to charity, the court took cognizance of the issues and ordered Inman to deposit evidence of his disposition of the funds, and Inman deposited the evidence of payments made to the charities.” Carreon wrote to MSNBC.com, \"While it's not the largest sum of money I have ever had a substantial role in raising, it is the first time I've seen it go to charity, and I think it's great.\" Carreon went on to propose a mud wrestling match with Inman but Inman declined. Robert X. Cringely wrote that Carreon's actions in the dispute made him \"Internet Enemy No. 1.\"\n\nIn June, a critic of Carreon set up the site charles-carreon.com, a blog that pretends to be written by Carreon while satirically criticizing him. The Charles Carreon Esq. character is obsessed with dinosaurs. On June 21, 2012 Carreon sent Register.com a letter demanding that they disclose the site's owner. Register.com acquiesced and briefly revealed the owner's name in the site's WHOIS information. \"Satirical Charles\" was represented by Paul Levy of Public Citizen \"pro bono\". Levy filed a federal suit \"Doe v. Carreon\" to seek a declaratory judgment to protect the satirical site's owner in July 2012. After evading service, Carreon agreed in December 2012 to settle for costs of $725. He then \"engaged in unnecessary, vexatious, and costly tactics\" to determine the proper amount of attorney fees, but was ultimately ordered to pay $46,100.25.\n\nOn July 7, 2012, Carreon released a music video \"Psycho Santa: The Heroic Exploits of Matt Inman / A Work of Perpendicular Fact\" on his new site Rapeutation.com. Carreon alleges that he was the victim of a \"Distributed Internet Reputation Attack (DIRA)\" perpetrated by \"large numbers of both human and digital Internet zombies\" acting in concert. Carreon claims to have evidence of a denial-of-service attack.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47541", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47541", "title": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 242", "text": "United Nations Security Council Resolution 242\n\nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 242 (S/RES/242) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council on November 22, 1967, in the aftermath of the Six-Day War. It was adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter. The resolution was sponsored by British ambassador Lord Caradon and was one of five drafts under consideration.\n\nThe preamble refers to the \"inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in the Middle East in which every State in the area can live in security\".\n\nOperative Paragraph One \"Affirms that the fulfillment of Charter principles requires the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East which should include the application of both the following principles:\n\nEgypt, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon entered into consultations with the UN Special representative over the implementation of 242. After denouncing it in 1967, Syria \"conditionally\" accepted the resolution in March 1972. Syria formally accepted UN Security Council Resolution 338, the cease-fire at the end of the Yom Kippur War (in 1973), which embraced resolution 242. \n\nOn 1 May 1968, the Israeli ambassador to the UN expressed Israel's position to the Security Council: \"My government has indicated its acceptance of the Security Council resolution for the promotion of agreement on the establishment of a just and lasting peace. I am also authorized to reaffirm that we are willing to seek agreement with each Arab State on all matters included in that resolution.\"\n\nIn September 1993, the PLO agreed that Resolutions 242 and 338 should be the basis for negotiations with Israel when it signed the Declaration of Principles.\n\nResolution 242 is one of the most widely affirmed resolutions on the Arab–Israeli conflict and formed the basis for later negotiations between the parties. These led to Peace Treaties between Israel and Egypt (1979) and Jordan (1994), as well as the 1993 and 1995 agreements with the Palestinians.\n\nThe resolution is the formula proposed by the Security Council for the resolution of the Arab–Israeli conflict, in particular, ending the state of belligerency then existing between the 'States concerned', Israel and Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. The resolution deals with five principles; withdrawal of Israeli forces, 'peace within secure and recognized boundaries', freedom of navigation, a just settlement of the refugee problem and security measures including demilitarized zones. It also provided for the appointment of a Special Representative to proceed to the Middle East in order to promote agreement on a peaceful and accepted settlement in accordance with the principles outlined in the resolution.\n\nUpon presenting the draft resolution to the Security Council, the U.K. representative Lord Caradon said:\n\nSecretary of State Dean Rusk commented on the most significant area of disagreement regarding the resolution:There was much bickering over whether that resolution should say from \"the\" territories or from \"all\" territories. In the French version, which is equally authentic, it says withdrawal de territory, with de meaning \"the.\" We wanted that to be left a little vague and subject to future negotiation because we thought the Israeli border along the West Bank could be \"rationalized\"; certain anomalies could easily be straightened out with some exchanges of territory, making a more sensible border for all parties. We also wanted to leave open demilitarization measures in the Sinai and the Golan Heights and take a fresh look at the old city of Jerusalem. But we never contemplated any significant grant of territory to Israel as a result of the June 1967 war. On that point we and the Israelis to this day remain sharply divided. This situation could lead to real trouble in the future. Although every President since Harry Truman has committed the United States to the security and independence of Israel, I'm not aware of any commitment the United States has made to assist Israel in retaining territories seized in the Six-Day War.\n\nA memorandum from the President's Special Assistant, Walt Rostow, to President Johnson said: \"What's on the Arab Ambassadors' minds boils down to one big question: Will we make good on our pledge to support the territorial integrity of all states in the Middle East? Our best answer is that we stand by that pledge, but the only way to make good on it is to have a genuine peace. The tough question is whether we'd force Israel back to 4 June borders if the Arabs accepted terms that amounted to an honest peace settlement. Secretary Rusk told the Yugoslav Foreign Minister: 'The US had no problem with frontiers as they existed before the outbreak of hostilities. If we are talking about national frontiers—in a state of peace—then we will work toward restoring them.' But we all know that could lead to a tangle with the Israelis.\"\n\nRusk met with Foreign Minister Nikezic on August 30, 1967. However, according to telegram 30825 to Belgrade, September 1, which summarizes the conversation, Rusk said the key to a settlement was to end the state of war and belligerence and that if a way could be found to deal with this, other things would fall into place; the difference between pre-June 5 positions and secure national boundaries was an important difference.\n\nPresident Johnson responded to a complaint from President Tito that Israel could change the frontiers without Arab consent: \"You note that the Arabs feel the US interprets the draft resolution to imply a change of frontiers to their detriment. We have no preconceptions on frontiers as such. What we believe to be important is that the frontiers be secure. For this the single most vital condition is that they be acceptable to both sides. It is a source of regret to us that the Arabs appear to misunderstand our proposal and misread our motives.\"\n\nFurthermore, Secretary Rusk's Telegram dated March 2, 1968, to the U.S. Interests Section of the Spanish Embassy in Cairo summarizing Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Eugene Rostow’s conversation with Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin states:\n\nIn an address delivered on September 1, 1982, President Ronald Reagan said:\n\nAccording to Michael Lynk, there are three schools of thought concerning the proper legal interpretation of the withdrawal phrase. Some of the parties involved have suggested that the indefinite language is a “perceptible loophole”, that authorizes “territorial revision” for Israel’s benefit. Some have stated that the indefinite language was used to permit insubstantial and mutually beneficial alterations to the 1949 armistices lines, but that unilateral annexation of the captured territory was never authorized. Other parties have said that no final settlement obtained through force or the threat of force could be considered valid. They insist that the Security Council cannot create loopholes in peremptory norms of international law or the UN Charter, and that any use of indefinite language has to be interpreted in line with the overriding legal principles regarding the “inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war” and the prohibitions on mass deportations or displacement in connection with the settlement of the refugee problem.\n\nAlexander Orakhelashvili says that the Security Council manifestly lacks the competence to validate agreements imposed through coercion, not least because the peremptory prohibition of the use of force is a limitation on the Council’s powers and the voidness of coercively imposed treaties is the clear consequence of jus cogens and the conventional law as reflected in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. A recent South African study concluded that the ultimate status and boundaries will require negotiation between the parties, according to Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. The same study also found that the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention which govern ‘special agreements’ that can adversely affect the rights of protected persons precludes any change in status of the territory obtained through an agreement concluded during a state of belligerent occupation.\n\nThe second preambular reference states: \n\nJohn McHugo says that by the 1920s, international law no longer recognized that a state could acquire title to territory by conquest. Article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations requires all members to refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.\n\nMichael Lynk says that article 2 of the Charter embodied a prevailing legal principle that there could be \"no title by conquest\". He says that principle had been expressed through numerous international conferences, doctrines and treaties since the late 19th Century. Lynk cites the examples of the First International Conference of American States in 1890; the United States Stimson Doctrine of 1932; the 1932 League of Nations resolution on Japanese aggression in China; the Buenos Aires Declaration of 1936; and the Atlantic Charter of 1941. Surya Sharma says that a war in self-defense cannot result in acquisition of title by conquest. He says that even if a war is lawful in origin it cannot exceed the limits of legitimate self-defense.\n\nThe resolution also calls for the implementation of the \"land for peace\" formula, calling for Israeli withdrawal from \"territories\" it had occupied in 1967 in exchange for peace with its neighbors. This was an important advance at the time, considering that there were no peace treaties between any Arab state and Israel until the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty of 1979. \"Land for peace\" served as the basis of the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty, in which Israel withdrew from the Sinai peninsula (Egypt withdrew its claims to the Gaza Strip in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization). Jordan renounced its claims regarding the West Bank in favor of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and has signed the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994, that established the Jordan River as the boundary of Jordan.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, there were Israeli-Syrian negotiations regarding a normalization of relations and an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. But a peace treaty was not made, mainly due to Syria's desire to recover and retain 25 square kilometers of territory in the Jordan River Valley which it seized in 1948 and occupied until 1967. As the United Nations recognizes only the 1948 borders, there is little support for the Syrian position outside the Arab bloc nor in resolving the Golan Heights issue.\n\nThe UN resolution does not specifically mention the Palestinians. The United Kingdom had recognized the union between the West Bank and Transjordan. Lord Caradon said that the parties assumed that withdrawal from occupied territories as provided in the resolution was applicable to East Jerusalem. \"Nevertheless so important is the future of Jerusalem that it might be argued that we should have specifically dealt with that issue in the 1967 Resolution. It is easy to say that now, but I am quite sure that if we had attempted to raise or settle the question of Jerusalem as a separate issue at that time our task in attempting to find a unanimous decision would have been far greater if not impossible.\"\n\nJudge Higgins of the International Court of Justice explained \"from Security Council resolution 242 (1967) through to Security Council Resolution 1515 (2003), the key underlying requirements have remained the same – that Israel is entitled to exist, to be recognized, and to security, and that the Palestinian people are entitled to their territory, to exercise self-determination, and to have their own State. Security Council resolution 1515 (2003)\nenvisages that these long-standing obligations are to be secured (...) by negotiation\"\n\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright told the U.N. Security Council: \"We simply do not support the description of the territories occupied by Israel in 1967 as 'Occupied Palestinian Territory'. In the view of my Government, this language could be taken to indicate sovereignty, a matter which both Israel and the PLO have agreed must be decided in negotiations on the final status of the territories. \"Had this language appeared in the operative paragraphs of the resolution, let me be clear: we would have exercised our veto. In fact, we are today voting against a resolution in the Commission on the Status of Women precisely because it implies that Jerusalem is \"occupied Palestinian territory\".\n\nThe Palestinians were represented by the Palestine Liberation Organization in negotiations leading to the Oslo Accords. They envisioned a 'permanent settlement based on Security Council Resolution 242'. The main premise of the Oslo Accords was the eventual creation of Palestinian autonomy in some or all of the territories captured during the Six-Day War, in return for Palestinian recognition of Israel. However, the Foreign Minister of the Palestinian Authority, Nabil Shaath, said: \"Whether a state is announced now or after liberation, its borders must be those of 4 June 1967. We will not accept a state without borders or with borders based on UN Resolution 242, which we believe is no longer suitable. On the contrary, Resolution 242 has come to be used by Israel as a way to procrastinate.\"\n\nThe Security Council subsequently adopted resolution 1515 (2003), which recalled resolution 242 and endorsed the Middle East Quartet’s Road Map towards a permanent, two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Quartet Plan calls for direct, bilateral negotiations as part of a comprehensive resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict, on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 242, 338, 1397, 1515, 1850, and the Madrid principles. The Quartet has reiterated that the only viable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an agreement that ends the occupation that began in 1967; resolves all permanent status issues as previously defined by the parties; and fulfils the aspirations of both parties for independent homelands through two states for two peoples, Israel and an independent, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.\n\nOn April 14, 2004, US President George W. Bush said to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, \"The United States reiterates its steadfast commitment to Israel's security, including secure, defensible borders.\" Israeli officials argue that the pre-1967 armistice line is not a defensible border, since Israel would be nine miles wide at the thinnest point, subjected to rocket fire from the highlands of the West Bank, and unable to stop smuggling from Jordan across the Jordan Valley. Thus, Israeli officials have been arguing for the final-status borders to be readjusted to reflect security concerns.\n\nResolution 1860 (2009) recalled resolution 242 and stressed that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 that will be a part of the Palestinian state.\n\nThe resolution advocates a \"just settlement of the refugee problem\". Lord Caradon said \"It has been said that in the Resolution we treated Palestinians only as refugees, but this is unjustified. We provided that Israel should withdraw from occupied territories and it was together with that requirement for a restoration of Arab territory that we also called for a settlement of the refugee problem.\" Upon the adoption of Resolution 242, French President Charles de Gaulle stressed this principle during a press conference on November 27, 1967, and confirmed it in his letter of January 9, 1968, to David Ben-Gurion. De Gaulle cited \"the pitiful condition of the Arabs who had sought refuge in Jordan or were relegated to Gaza\" and stated that provided Israel withdrew her forces, it appeared it would be possible to reach a solution \"within the framework of the United Nations that included the assurance of a dignified and fair future for the refugees and minorities in the Middle East.\"\n\nAlexander Orakhelashvili said that ‘Just settlement’ can only refer to a settlement guaranteeing\nthe return of displaced Palestinians. He explained that it must be presumed that the Council did not adopt decisions that validated mass deportation or displacement, since expulsion or deportation are crimes against humanity or an exceptionally serious war crime.\n\nAccording to M. Avrum Ehrlich, 'Resolution 242 called for \"a just solution to the refugee problem,\" a term covering Jewish refugees from Arab countries as stated by President Carter in 1978 at Camp David'.\n\nAccording to John Quigley, however, it is clear from the context in which it was adopted, and from the statements recounted by the delegates, that Resolution 242 contemplates the Palestine Arab refugees only.\n\nComplicating the issue, Arthur Goldberg, one of the key drafters of the final language present in the resolution, pointed out that the language intentionally refers to both Jewish and Arab refugees.\n\nThe English version of the clause:Withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflictis given in French as:\n\nThe difference between the two versions lies in the absence of a definite article (\"the\") in the English version, while the word \"des\" present in the French version in the expression \"des territoires occupés\" can only mean \"from the occupied territories\" (the \"des\" in front of \"territoires occupés\" can only be the contraction \"from the\" because of the use of the word \"retrait\" which entails an object – \"des forces israéliennes\" where the \"des\" is the contraction of \"of the\" (of the Israeli forces) and a location \"des territoires occupés\" where the \"des\" is the contraction of \"from the\" (from the occupied territories)). If the meaning of \"from some occupied territories\" were intended, the only way to say so in French would have been \"de territoires occupés\".\n\nAlthough some have dismissed the controversy by suggesting that the use of the word \"des\" in the French version is a translation error and should therefore be ignored in interpreting the document, the debate has retained its force since both versions are of equal legal force, as recognized languages of the United Nations and in international law.\n\nSolicitor John McHugo, a partner at Trowers & Hamlins and a visiting fellow at the Scottish Centre for International Law at Edinburgh University, draws a comparison to phrases such as:\n\nIn spite of the lack of definite articles, according to McHugo, it is clear that such an instruction cannot legitimately be taken to imply that some dogs need not be kept on the lead or that the rule applies only near some ponds. Further, McHugo points out a potential consequence of the logic employed by advocates of a \"some\" reading. Paragraph 2 (a) of the resolution, which guarantees \"freedom of navigation through international waterways in the area,\" may allow Arab states to interfere with navigation through \"some\" international waterways of their choosing.\n\nGlenn Perry asserts that because the French version resolves ambiguities in the English text, and is more consistent with the other clauses of the treaty, it is the correct interpretation. He argues that \"it is an accepted rule that the various language versions must be considered together, with the ambiguities of one version elucidated by the other\". He cites Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that except when a treaty provides that one text shall prevail \"the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted\". He furthermore argues that the context of the passage, in a treaty that reaffirms \"'territorial integrity', 'territorial inviolability,' and 'the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war' – taken together cannot be reconciled with anything less than full withdrawal\". He argues that the reference to \"secure and recognized borders\" can be interpreted in several ways, and only one of them contradicts the principle of full withdrawal.\n\nShabtai Rosenne, former Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations Office at Geneva and member of the UN's International Law Commission, notes that:\n\nOnly English and French were the Security Council's working languages (Arabic, Russian, Spanish and Chinese were official but not the working languages).\n\nThe Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America argues the practice at the UN is that the binding version of any resolution is the one voted upon. In the case of 242 that version was in English, so they assert the English version the only binding one.David A. Korn asserts that this was indeed the position held by the United States and United Kingdom:\n\nThe French representative to the Security Council, in the debate immediately after the vote, asserted (in the official translation from French):\n\nOpponents of the \"all territories\" reading remind that the UN Security Council declined to adopt a draft resolution, including the definite article, far prior to the adoption of Resolution 242. They argue that, in interpreting a resolution of an international organization, one must look to the process of the negotiation and adoption of the text. This would make the text in English, the language of the discussion, take precedence.\n\nA Congressional Research Service (CRS) Issue Brief quotes policy statements made by President Johnson in a speech delivered on September 10, 1968, and by Secretary of State Rogers in a speech delivered on December 9, 1969: \"The United States has stated that boundaries should be negotiated and mutually recognized, 'should not reflect the weight of conquest,' and that adjustments in the pre-1967 boundaries should be 'insubstantial.'\"\n\nPresident Carter asked for a State Department report \"to determine if there was any justice to the Israeli position that the resolution did not include all the occupied territories\". The State Department report concluded:Support for the concept of total withdrawal was widespread in the Security Council, and it was only through intensive American efforts that a resolution was adopted which employed indefinite language in the withdrawal clause. In the process of obtaining this result, the United States made clear to the Arab states and several other members of the Security Council that the United States envisioned only insubstantial revisions of the 1949 armistice lines. Israel did not protest the approach.\nRuth Lapidoth describes the view, adopted by Israel, which holds that the resolution allowed Israel to retain \"some territories\". She argues \"The provision on the establishment of “secure and recognized boundaries” would have been meaningless if there had been an obligation to withdraw from all the territories.\nU.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger recalled the first time he heard someone invoke \"the sacramental language of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242, mumbling about the need for a just and lasting peace within secure and recognized borders\". He said the phrase was so platitudinous that he thought the speaker was pulling his leg. Kissinger said that, at that time, he did not appreciate how the flood of words used to justify the various demands obscured rather than illuminated the fundamental positions. Kissinger said those \"clashing perspectives\" prevented any real bargaining and explained:\nHowever, speaking to Henry Kissinger, President Richard Nixon said \"You and I both know they can’t go back to the other [1967] borders. But we must not, on the other hand, say that because the Israelis win this war, as they won the '67 War, that we just go on with status quo. It can't be done.\" Kissinger replied \"I couldn't agree more\"\n\nMoreover, President Gerald Ford said: \"The U.S. further supports the position that a just and lasting peace, which remains our objective, must be acceptable to both sides. The U.S. has not developed a final position on the borders. Should it do so it will give great weight to Israel's position that any peace agreement with Syria must be predicated on Israel remaining on the Golan Heights.\"\n\nFurthermore, Secretary of State George Shultz declared: \"Israel will never negotiate from, or return to, the lines of partition or to the 1967 borders.\"\nSecretary of State Christopher's letter to Netanyahu states: \"I would like to reiterate our position that Israel is entitled to secure and defensible borders, which should be directly negotiated and agreed with its neighbors.\"\n\nA key part of the case in favour of a \"some territories\" reading is the claim that British and American officials involved in the drafting of the resolution omitted the definite article deliberately in order to make it less demanding on the Israelis. As George Brown, British Foreign Secretary in 1967, said:\n\nLord Caradon, chief author of the resolution, takes a subtly different slant. His focus seems to be that the lack of a definite article is intended to deny permanence to the \"unsatisfactory\" pre-1967 border, rather than to allow Israel to retain land taken by force. Such a view would appear to allow for the possibility that the borders could be varied through negotiation:\n\nArthur J. Goldberg, another of the resolution's drafters, concurred that Resolution 242 does not dictate the extent of the withdrawal, and added that this matter should be negotiated between the parties:\n\nMr. Michael Stewart, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in a reply to a question in Parliament, 9 December 1969: \"As I have explained before, there is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council Resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate.\"\n\nMr. Joseph J. Sisco, Assistant Secretary of State, 12 July 1970 (NBC \"Meet the Press\"): \"That Resolution did not say 'withdrawal to the pre-June 5 lines'. The Resolution said that the parties must negotiate to achieve agreement on the so-called final secure and recognized borders. In other words, the question of the final borders is a matter of negotiations between the parties.\" Mr. Sisco was actively involved in drafting the resolution in his capacity as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs in 1967.\n\nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson:\n\nOn June 19, 1967, President Johnson declared the five principles, including land for peace, that he believed comprised the components of any United Nations settlement of the Middle East crisis. He pledged the U.S. Government would \"do its part for peace in every forum, at every level, at every hour\". On July 12, 1967, Secretary of State Rusk announced that the U.S. position on the Near East crisis was outlined in the President's statement of June 19 and that it provided the basis for a just and equitable settlement between the Arab states and Israel. On August 16, 1967, the Israeli Foreign Office stated that Israel agreed with the principles set forth by the President on June 19 and indicated that no resolution would be acceptable if it deviated from them.\n\nOn June 9, 1967, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban assured Arthur Goldberg, US Ambassador to the UN, that Israel was not seeking territorial aggrandizement and had no \"colonial\" aspirations. Secretary of State Rusk stressed to the Government of Israel that no settlement with Jordan would be accepted by the world community unless it gave Jordan some special position in the Old City of Jerusalem. The US also assumed Jordan would receive the bulk of the West Bank as that was regarded as Jordanian territory.\n\nOn November 3, 1967, Ambassador Goldberg, accompanied by Mr. Sisco and Mr. Pedersen, called on King Hussein of Jordan. Goldberg said the US was committed to the principle of political independence and territorial integrity and was ready to reaffirm it bilaterally and publicly in the Security Council resolution. Goldberg said the US believes in territorial integrity, withdrawal, and recognition of secure boundaries. Goldberg said the principle of territorial integrity has two important sub-principles: there must be a withdrawal to recognized and secure frontiers for all countries, not necessarily the old armistice lines, and there must be mutuality in adjustments.\n\nWalt Rostow advised President Johnson that Secretary Rusk had explained to Mr. Eban that US support for secure permanent frontiers does not mean the US supports territorial changes. The record of a meeting between Under Secretary of State Eugene Rostow and Israeli Ambassador Harmon stated that Rostow made clear the US view that there should be movement from General Armistice Agreements to conditions of peace and that this would involve some adjustments of armistice lines as foreseen in the Armistice Agreements. Rostow told Harmon that he had already stressed to Foreign Minister Eban that the US expected the thrust of the settlement would be toward security and demilitarization arrangements rather than toward major changes in the Armistice lines. Harmon said the Israeli position was that Jerusalem should be an open city under unified administration but that the Jordanian interest in Jerusalem could be met through arrangements including \"sovereignty\". Rostow said the US government assumed (and Harman confirmed) that despite public statements to the contrary, the Government of Israel position on Jerusalem was that which Eban, Harman, and Evron had given several times, that Jerusalem was negotiable.\n\nAmbassador Goldberg briefed King Hussein on US assurances regarding territorial integrity. Goldberg said the US did not view Jordan as a country that consisted only of the East Bank, and that the US was prepared to support a return of the West Bank to Jordan with minor boundary rectifications. The US would use its influence to obtain compensation to Jordan for any territory it would be required to give up. Finally, although as a matter of policy the US did not agree with Jordan's position on Jerusalem, nor with the Israeli position on Jerusalem, the US was prepared to use its influence to obtain for Jordan a role in Jerusalem. Secretary Rusk advised President Johnson that he confirmed Goldberg's pledge regarding territorial integrity to King Hussein.\n\nDuring a subsequent meeting between President Johnson, King Hussein, and Secretary of State Rusk, Hussein said the phrasing of the resolution calling for withdrawal from occupied territories could be interpreted to mean that the Egyptians should withdraw from Gaza and the Jordanians should withdraw from the West Bank. He said this possibility was evident from a speech given by Prime Minister Eshkol in which it had been claimed that both Gaza and the West Bank had been \"occupied territory\". The President agreed, and promised he would talk to Ambassador Goldberg about inserting Israel in that clause. Ambassador Goldberg told King Hussein that after taking into account legitimate Arab concerns and suggestions, the US would be willing to add the word \"Israeli\" before \"Armed Forces\" in the first operative paragraph.\n\nA State Department study noted that when King Hussein met on 8 November with President Johnson, who had been briefed by Secretary Rusk on the US interpretation, the Jordanian monarch asked how soon the Israeli troops would withdraw from most of the occupied lands. The President replied \"In six months.\"\n\nWilliam Quandt wrote about Johnson's meeting with Eban on October 24, 1967, and noted that Israel had annexed East Jerusalem. He said Johnson forcefully told Eban he thought Israel had been unwise when it went to war and that he still thought they were unwise. The President stressed the need to respect the territorial integrity of the Arab states. Quandt said \"'The President wished to caution the Israelis that the further they get from June 5 the further they get from peace.' Meaning the more territory they insisted on holding beyond the 1967 lines, the worse would be the odds of getting a peace agreement with the Arabs.\"\n\nIsrael interprets Resolution 242 as calling for withdrawal from territories as part of a negotiated peace and full diplomatic recognition. The extent of withdrawal would come as a result of comprehensive negotiations that led to durable peace not before Arabs start to meet their own obligations under Resolution 242.\n\nInitially, the resolution was accepted by Egypt, Jordan and Israel but not by the Palestine Liberation Organization. The Arab position was initially that the resolution called for Israel to withdraw from all the territory it occupied during the Six-Day War prior to peace agreements.\n\nIsrael and the Arab states have negotiated before the Israeli withdrawal. Israel and Jordan made peace without Israel withdrawing from the West Bank, since Jordan had already renounced its claims and recognized the PLO as the sole representative of the Palestinians. Egypt began negotiations before Israel withdrew from the Sinai. Negotiations ended without Egypt ever resuming control of the Gaza Strip, which Egypt held until 1967.\n\nSupporters of the \"Palestinian viewpoint\" focus on the phrase in the resolution's preamble emphasizing the \"inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war\", and note that the French version called for withdrawal from \"des territoires occupés\" – \"\"the\" territories occupied\". The French UN delegation insisted on this interpretation at the time, but both English and French are the Secretariat's working languages.\n\nSupporters of the \"Israeli viewpoint\" note that the second part of that same sentence in the preamble explicitly recognizes the need of existing states to live in security.\nThey focus on the operative phrase calling for \"secure and recognized boundaries\" and note that the resolution calls for a withdrawal \"from territories\" rather than \"from the territories\" or \"from all territories,\" as the Arabs and others proposed; the latter two terms were rejected from the final draft of Resolution 242.\n\nAlexander Orakhelashvili cites a number cases in which international tribunals have ruled that international organizations, including the Security Council, are bound by general international law. He says that inclusion of explicit clauses about the inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war and requiring respect of territorial integrity and sovereignty of a state demonstrates that the Council does not intend to offend peremptory norms in these specific ways. The resolution also acknowledges that these principles must be part of an accepted settlement. That is confirmed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which reiterates the prohibition on the use of force and provides that any settlement obtained by the threat or use of force in violation of the principles of international law embodied in the Charter of the United Nations or conflicting with a peremptory norm of general international law is invalid. According to Hans-Paul Gasser, ‘doubtful’ wording of the Council’s resolutions must always be construed in such a way as to avoid conflict with fundamental international obligations.\n\nThe USSR, India, Mali, Nigeria and Arab States all proposed that the resolution be changed to read \"all territories\" instead of \"territories.\" Their request was discussed by the UN Security Council and \"territories\" was adopted instead of \"all territories\", after President Johnson told Premier Alexei Kosygin that the delegates should not try to negotiate the details of a Middle East settlement in the corridors and meeting halls of the United Nations, and Ambassador Goldberg stipulated that the exact wording of the resolution would not affect the position of any of the parties. Per Lord Caradon, the chief author of the resolution:\n\nLord Caradon also maintained,\nDuring a symposium on the subject Lord Caradon said that Israel was in clear defiance of resolution 242. He specifically cited the \"annexation of East Jerusalem\" and \"the creeping colonialism on the West Bank and in Gaza and in the Golan.\"\n\nHowever, British Foreign Secretary George Brown said:\n\nThe representative for India stated to the Security Council:\n\nThe representatives from Nigeria, France, Soviet Union, Bulgaria, United Arab Republic (Egypt), Ethiopia, Jordan, Argentina and Mali supported this view, as worded by the representative from Mali: \"[Mali] wishes its vote today to be interpreted in the light of the clear and unequivocal interpretation which the representative of India gave of the provisions of the United Kingdom text.\" The Russian representative Vasili Kuznetsov stated:\n\nIsrael was the only country represented at the Security Council to express a contrary view. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Denmark, China and Japan were silent on the matter, but the US and UK did point out that other countries' comments on the meaning of 242 were simply their own views. The Syrian representative was strongly critical of the text's \"vague call on Israel to withdraw\".\n\nThe statement by the Brazilian representative perhaps gives a flavour of the complexities at the heart of the discussions:\n\nHowever, the Soviet delegate Vasily Kuznetsov argued: \" ... phrases such as 'secure and recognized boundaries'. ... make it possible for Israel itself arbitrarily to establish new boundaries and to withdraw its forces only to those lines it considers appropriate.\" [1373rd meeting, para. 152.]\n\nU.S. Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, who represented the US in discussions, later stated: \"The notable omissions in regard to withdrawal are the word 'the' or 'all' and 'the June 5, 1967 lines' the resolution speaks of withdrawal from occupied territories, without defining the extent of withdrawal\".\n\nOn November 23, 1967, the Secretary General appointed Gunnar Jarring as Special Envoy to negotiate the implementation of the resolution with the parties, the so-called Jarring Mission. The governments of Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon recognized Jarring's appointment and agreed to participate in his shuttle diplomacy, although they differed on key points of interpretation of the resolution. The government of Syria rejected Jarring's mission on grounds that total Israeli withdrawal was a prerequisite for further negotiations. The talks under Jarring's auspices lasted until 1973, but bore no results. After 1973, the Jarring mission was replaced by bilateral and multilateral peace conferences.\n\n\n\n"}

In the United States, White Parties have taken place in Chicago, New York City, Miami, Palm Springs, California, and other cities. Other White Parties have taken place in Montreal, Rome, Gothenburg, Doncaster and Hong Kong. The events are generally independent of each other.\n\nOne of the first parties was held August 8, 1974, hosted by Chicago business owner Chuck Renslow to celebrate his birthday and thank his patrons. It was then held for the next 36 years until 2010. The largest party was held in 1979 at Navy Pier with 5,000 participants.\n\nThe New York City White Party was first held at the private gay disco \"Flamingo\" on Broadway and Houston, on Presidents' Day weekend. The white theme derived from the snow often to be found that time of year. It was then adopted by the East Village disco \"The Saint\" during the month of February of each year usually coinciding with the full moon. Dress requirement was always white. After the closing of \"The Saint\" in 1988, The White Party became the norm for other cities around the country in the current circuit party system to host such events.\n\nThe Miami White Party is an annual fundraiser party for HIV/AIDS research. The all-white clothing theme was chosen by co-founders Frank Wager and Jorge Suarez. The first White Party began as AIDS began decimating the gay population. Wager and Suarez began planning an event they hoped would raise awareness and money to reduce HIV/AIDS in South Florida.\n\nWagner, Suarez and their friends dropped leaflets outside gay bars in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, got businesses to donate food and liquor and promoted the party. Sixteen hundred guests, asked to wear white, attended on Sunday night, December 1, 1985. Each paid $10. Wager, a Salvadoran-born real-estate agent, hadn't yet been diagnosed with HIV when the first White Party was held, which benefited Health Crisis Network (now known as Care Resource).\n\nThrough the years, White Party attendees have included Nell Carter (who sang at the first White Party), Madonna, Calvin Klein, Jennifer Lopez, Yoko Ono, Crystal Waters, Exposé, Lorna Luft and Cyndi Lauper, and in 2013 Estonian singer Kerli performed.\n\nThe one-night fundraiser became a week of events held annually on November 27 with events in Miami and Miami Beach. Most of the parties are geared to gay men, but there are several events for lesbians and mixed crowds as well. In 1994 Keith Cromley the Assistant Director of Development at Health Crisis Network and Alain Berrebi, Founding Chair of White Party Week,\nworked together to create White Party Week in Miami, first as a fundraiser for Health Crisis Network then for Care Resource.\nLark Bennett, Director of Development at Care Resource and Keith Cromley we’re both instrumental as staff members in making sure that this huge event ran like a well-oiled machine. White Party Week started off in 1995 with six events and grew to 23 events by the year 2000.\n\nIn 1995, more events were added, including \"White Dreams\" and \"Muscle Beach\". In 1998, the Health Crisis Network merged with Community Research Initiative, and the White Party Week brought in over $2 million. It is now the largest HIV/AIDS fundraiser in the world, with DJs, performers and artists attending from several countries. White Party CDs have been produced since 1996 with White Party remixes appearing on dance charts.\n\nCare Resource, the producers of White Party Week, is a 501(c)(3) non profit medical agency operating with over 200 employees in Miami-Dade, Miami Beach and Broward County providing medical, counseling, testing, psychosocial, food bank services and more to their clients. White Party Week Miami attracts thousands of participants with a week of dance and events, mostly for an LGBT demographic. The main White Party event is customarily held at Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, the renaissance mansion in Coconut Grove, with other events held at venues elsewhere in South Florida.\n\nIn 2013 DJ Offer Nissim performed. Muscle Beach Party and women's events were also held. White Party Week Miami was the subject of documentaries on Bravo, The Travel Channel, and the BBC, with the documentary film \"Fabulous\" in 1999, Playboy Channel, and in two episodes of \"Queer as Folk\". It is the setting for the 2001 documentary film \"When Boys Fly\".\n\nPalm Springs, California, has held an annual White Party since 1990. The event was featured in the 2001 film \"Circuit\", a 2004 episode of the television series \"The L Word\", and a 2006 episode of the reality television series \"The Janice Dickinson Modeling Agency\". The Palm Springs White Party was described by \"Frommer's Travel Guide\" as \"one of the biggest and best on the US party circuit ... [with] over 20,000 gay men dressed in white. The Palm Springs White Party Sunday Tea Dance features a Ferris Wheel and a fireworks display.\" In 2004, \"The New York Times\" travel section featured an in-depth look at The White Party in Palm Springs in conjunction with staff members of Noizemag.\n\nEvery Easter Sunday in Montreal, a white party (Bal en Blanc) catering to both straight and gay attendees is held. It usually attracts over 16,000 attendees with previous performers including Armin Van Buuren, Above and Beyond, Offer Nissim, Peter Rauhofer, Deep Dish, Tiësto, and David Guetta.\n\nA white party was held for Sunee Plaza in Pattaya, Thailand, on November 15, 2009, as part of their Pride event. The party required all the staff in the gay bars to dress in white and offered discounts to customers who also dressed in white. The event featured street performers and events held in the Plaza.\n\nEvery winter, a White Party is held during the Arosa Gay Ski Week in Arosa, Switzerland. The party called \"Snow White Ball\" hosted by the Jungle Gay Party promoters is the closing party of the festival and takes place on top of the Aroser Weisshorn at 2’653m / 8’704 ft over sea level.\n\nHong Kong, China has hosted a White Party annually since 2005. White Party Hong Kong is founded and owned by Makhssian Trajan, and in recent years the White Party in Hong Kong has drawn thousands of spectators all dressed in white to celebrate love and friendship, becoming the biggest annual event of its kind in Hong Kong.\n\n\n"}
