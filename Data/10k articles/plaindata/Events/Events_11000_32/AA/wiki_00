{"id": "1822802", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1822802", "title": "2003 Texas redistricting", "text": "2003 Texas redistricting\n\nThe 2003 Texas redistricting refers to a controversial mid-decade state plan that defined new Congressional districts. In the 2004 elections, this redistricting resulted in the Republicans taking a majority of Texas's House seats for the first time since Reconstruction. Opponents challenged the plan in three suits, combined when the case went to the United States Supreme Court in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" (2006).\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court upheld the statewide redistricting as constitutional, with the exception of Texas' 23rd congressional district, which it held was racially gerrymandered in violation of Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, apparently to try to protect a Hispanic Republican representative. A three-judge Federal District Court redrew District 23 and four other nearby districts: 15, 21, 25, and 28. In November 2006, a special election was held in the new districts. All incumbents won except in District 23. There, Republican incumbent Henry Bonilla was forced into a December run-off after a jungle primary; he lost to Democratic challenger Ciro Rodriguez.\n\nAfter Republicans won control of the Texas state legislature in 2002 for the first time in 130 years, they intended to work toward establishing a majority of House of Representatives seats from Texas held by their party. After the 2002 election, Democrats had a 17–15 edge in House seats representing Texas, although the state's voters voted for Republicans in congressional races by a 55–45 margin. After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C, introduced in the Texas House by Representative Phil King of Weatherford. In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats' 11, which suggested they had considerably surpassed their margin of preference among voters.\n\nOn June 28, 2006, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion that threw out one of the districts in the plan as a violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act because of racial gerrymandering. It ordered the lower court to produce a remedial plan, which it did in Plan 1440C. The Supreme Court ruling was not considered to seriously threaten Republican gains from the 2004 elections.\n\nThe Texas Legislature had last enacted a Congressional redistrict plan in 1991, following the 1990 census. At the time, Democrats held both the governor's seat (with Ann Richards) and control of both state legislative branches. By the 2000 census, Republicans had recaptured the state executive branch, having elected Governor George W. Bush and Lt. Governor Rick Perry, as well as control of the Texas Senate. Democrats maintained their majority in the Texas House of Representatives.\n\nIn 2001, Democrats and Republicans were unable to agree on new district maps to respond to the latest census. The Republican minority recommended the issue be submitted to a panel of judges, per state law. The judges, being \"hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another\", drew a new map which left many of the 1991 districts intact. It yielded a 17 to 15 Democratic majority in Texas's US House delegation after the 2002 elections.\n\nFor Texas House and Senate redistricting, the Texas Constitution provides that the Legislative Redistricting Board (LRB) convenes when the state legislature is unable to approve, for either body, a redistricting plan in the first legislative session following the National Census. In June 2001, the task of redistricting passed to the LRB after the state legislature failed to pass a redistricting plan for either the House or Senate. The LRB consists of five statewide officials, the Lieutenant Governor, the Speaker of the House, the Attorney General, the State Comptroller, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Four of these five officials were Republican, and the resulting redistricting plans were seen as favorable to Republicans.\n\nIn September 2001, then House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (TX-22) organized Texans for a Republican Majority (TRMPAC), a political action committee designed to gather campaign funds for Republican candidates throughout Texas—in particular with an eye to gaining control of the House Speakership, then held by Democrat Pete Laney. TRMPAC was modeled closely after DeLay's Americans for a Republican Majority (ARMPAC), a federal-level organization created to raise funds for Republicans during the 2000 national elections. Simultaneously, as has been well documented in the media, DeLay played a key role in the ongoing Texas redistricting effort. \n\nIn 2002, after winning a majority of seats in the State House of Representatives, Republicans gained complete control of the legislature. With the urging of Governor Rick Perry and Tom Delay, who had assumed the position of US House Majority Leader in January 2003, the Republican majority introduced legislation to redraw the court-drawn districts from 2001.\n\nLacking sufficient votes to stop the new plan, 52 Democratic members fled the state to prevent a quorum in the Texas House, effectively preventing a vote from taking place during the regular session. The 52 Democrats, known as the \"Killer Ds\", returned to the state when time had expired for the bill. But in the summer of 2003, Governor Rick Perry called a series of special legislative sessions in order to continue the redistricting effort. With control of more than one-third of the seats in the State Senate, the Democrats invoked a two-thirds rule, preventing a vote on the redistricting plan during the first special session. Half an hour after ending the first special session, Governor Perry called a second special session. This time, due to the calendaring of the redistricting bill, the two-thirds rule would not come into play. Eleven of the twelve Democratic state senators left the state to prevent a quorum. The Senators assembled in Albuquerque, New Mexico and were referred to as the Texas Eleven. After a month-long stand off, Senator John Whitmire returned to the State Senate. The redistricting plan was passed in a third special legislative session. After the 2004 elections, Texas' U.S. House delegation had a Republican majority, 21-11, for the first time since Reconstruction. The demographics of the Republican Party in Texas, and across the South, had markedly changed by then, being made up primarily of conservative whites.\n\nAn article in the March 6, 2006, issue of \"The New Yorker\" magazine, written by Jeffrey Toobin, quoted Texas's junior Republican Senator John Cornyn as saying, \"Everybody who knows Tom knows that he's a fighter and a competitor, and he saw an opportunity to help the Republicans stay in power in Washington.\" Toobin reported that DeLay left Washington and returned to Texas to oversee the project while final voting was underway in the state legislature, and that \"several times during the long days of negotiating sessions, DeLay personally shuttled proposed maps among House and Senate offices in Austin.\" \"Texas Monthly\" editor Paul Burka, writing in the magazine's May 2006 issue, characterized the measure as \"DeLay's midcensus congressional redistricting plan\" and said, \"[I]n order to increase his Republican majority in Congress, he [DeLay] resorted to a midcensus redistricting plan.\" \n\nAt the time of the 2003 redistricting, Texas was under the pre-clearance requirements of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The State of Texas obtained pre-clearance from the US Department of Justice for its 2003 Congressional redistricting plan.\n\nBut in December 2005, \"The Washington Post\" reported, \"Justice Department lawyers concluded that the landmark Texas congressional redistricting plan spearheaded by Rep. Tom DeLay violated the Voting Rights Act, according to a previously undisclosed memo,\" uncovered by the newspaper. The document, endorsed by six Justice Department attorneys, said\n[T]he redistricting plan illegally diluted black and Hispanic voting power in two congressional districts ... The State of Texas has not met its burden in showing that the proposed congressional redistricting plan does not have a discriminatory effect.\nIn addition, according to the \"Post\", Justice Department lawyers \"found that Republican lawmakers and state officials who helped craft the proposal were aware it posed a high risk of being ruled discriminatory compared with other options\". Texas legislators proceeded with the new plan \"because it would maximize the number of Republican federal lawmakers in the state\".\n\nThe article noted that senior political appointees in the Justice Department had overridden the position and findings by the Civil Rights Division's career civil service staff lawyers and analysts, and approved the redistricting.\n\nDemocrats criticized the 2003 redistricting plan, citing the lack of precedent for redistricting twice in a decade (a so-called \"mid-decade\" redistricting) and argued that it was conducted for purely political gain by the Republican Party. Public comments by some Republicans lent support to this latter claim, since many discussed their expectations of picking up several Republican seats. Some minority groups argued the plan was unconstitutional, as it would dilute their influence and possibly violate the \"one-person-one-vote\" principle of redistricting. Republicans argued that, since most voters in the state were Republicans, that they be represented by a majority-Republican Congressional delegation in Washington.\n\nThe 2004 elections under the new redistricting resulted in Texas Republicans gaining a majority of House seats by a 21–11 margin, nearly a 2/1 ratio in terms of seats (66% of seats). This was significantly larger than the 61/38 voting ratio of Republicans to Democrats in the Presidential race. It was much more lopsided than the total results in the 32 House races, which resulted in 56/40/3 for Republican to Democratic voting (the two main parties did not both run candidates in four districts).\n\nThe US Supreme Court issued an opinion on the case in \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" on June 28, 2006. While the Court said states are free to redistrict as often as desired, the justices ruled that Texas's 23rd congressional district was invalid, as it violated Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act by racial gerrymandering. This decision required lawmakers to adjust boundaries in line with the Court's ruling.\n\nA three-judge panel, under an order from the U.S. Court of Appeals, oversaw the redistricting. On June 29, 2006, a U.S. District Judge ordered both sides to submit proposed maps by July 14, respond to their opponents' maps by July 21, and be prepared to hold oral arguments on August 3.\n\nThe 2003 redistricting targeted ten districts with white Democratic incumbents, avoiding the seven districts with minority Democratic incumbents.\n\n\nThe redistricting appeared intended to protect Henry Bonilla, a Hispanic Republican of TX-23. He had faced a stiff challenge from conservative Democrat Henry Cuellar in 2002. It also neutralized liberal Democrat Ciro Rodriguez. This was done by putting the two Democrats in the same district and forcing them to run against each other for the Democratic nomination (Cuellar won). \n\nIn 2006, however, the Supreme Court ruling required redrawing the boundaries for TX-23. It resulted in a special election, in which Bonilla faced six Democratic candidates and an independent in a jungle primary. He was defeated by Democrat Ciro Rodriguez in the run-off.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "41108484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41108484", "title": "Airport-to-airport mutual aid", "text": "Airport-to-airport mutual aid\n\nAirport-to-airport mutual aid programs provide expert assistance and material support to an airport that has been affected by a natural or manmade disaster on a voluntary basis from other airports. The concept has been described as \"airports helping airports.\" \n\nThe first example in the world was the Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group (SEADOG), which was founded in 2004-2005 under the leadership of Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport and Orlando International Airport. The initial emphasis of SEADOG was assistance to airports recovering from hurricanes. SEADOG's first mobilization was to Pensacola International Airport after Hurricane Ivan in 2004. SEADOG's most notable mobilizations were to Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and to Jack Brooks Regional Airport to assist with urban search and rescue operations after Hurricane Ike hit Galveston and Houston in 2008. More than 20 airports from all over the U.S. contributed assistance through SEADOG after Hurricane Katrina. SEADOG has a dedicated website.\n\nIn 2007, the Western Airports Disaster Operations Group (WESTDOG) was formed under the leadership of Portland International Airport. WESTDOG's mission was nearly identical to that of SEADOG although WESTDOG's primary focus is earthquakes, but there are minor administrative differences between the two disaster operations groups (DOGs). Unlike SEADOG, joining WESTDOG requires a formal resolution by the airport authority, port authority, city, or county that owns the airport. WESTDOG has a written operations manual and a dedicated website (WESTDOG 2011-2013).\n\nThe fundamental principles of airport-to-airport mutual aid are that no one can help an airport as well as someone from another airport, no mandatory requirement to send assistance, no self-deployment, matching of specific needs for skilled airport personnel and equipment to volunteered personnel and equipment, and self-sufficiency of the deployed assistance teams. Since the DOGs are mutual aid programs, there are no financial arrangement built into the program. If an airport deploys through SEADOG or WESTDOG in a disaster that is the subject of a Presidential disaster declaration, then reimbursement and liability coverage under the Stafford Act and using the procedures of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) apply.\n\nBoth SEADOG and WESTDOG depend on coordinating airports that volunteer for that role. SEADOG has four airports that coordinate geographic regions and three specialized coordinators for aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), law enforcement and security, and rapid engineering assessment. The airports serving in these roles have indefinite terms. WESTDOG has a primary coordinating airport and a secondary coordinating airport that serve one-year terms, with the secondary airport moving up into the primary role after one year. Both DOGs have created permanent communications systems for the dissemination of alerts and the management of volunteered resources and matching of volunteers to need. SEADOG and WESTDOG communicate closely and collaborate. They had their first joint SEADOG-WESTDOG Annual Conference at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 16–18 October 2013.\n\nThere are no DOGs in any other region of the United States (IEM et al. 2012). However, airports outside the southeastern and western states have provided aid through SEADOG. Membership in SEADOG or WESTDOG is open to any airport regardless of location in the United States.\n\nThere is a third airport-to-airport mutual aid program, the Colorado Aviation Recovery Support Team (CARST). Established by the Colorado Airport Operators Association (CAOA), CARST provides specialized, highly experienced airport and aviation professions to help an airport or community deal with issues involved in recovering from a crash. CARST grew out of experiences with the Avjet crash at Aspen-Pitken County Airport (ASE/KASE) in 2001.\n\nIn 2012 the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies published a guidebook for how to establish, manage, and sustain an airport-to-airport mutual aid program. It is ACRP Report 73.\n\nThere are no airport-to-airport mutual aid programs outside the United States, but the feasibility of an airport-to-airport mutual aid program for Latin America and the Caribbean has begun to be considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of the United Nations (UN), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several other organizations. Many observers have believed that mutual aid could not operate across national borders because of barriers created by legal, language, and cultural differences and delays created by work rules, customs and duties, and immigration. It has been proposed that inclusion of airlines, national agencies, and international agencies and industry associations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Airports Council International (ACI), and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) can overcome such barriers by sharing their day-to-day expertise operating internationally. Formalization of the proposal is expected in 2014. If the DOG for Latin America and the Caribbean is implemented in full or as a pilot project in a subregion such as the Caribbean Basin or Central America, it will probably be the first cross-border airport-to-airport mutual aid program in the world outside the United States.\n"}

It has since become a movement, with algoraves taking place around the world.\n\nAn algorave is an event where people dance to music generated from algorithms, often using live coding techniques. Algoraves can include a range of styles, including a complex form of minimal techno, and the movement has been described as a meeting point of hacker philosophy, geek culture, and clubbing. \n\nAlthough live coding is commonplace, any algorithmic music is welcome which is \"wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals\", which is a corruption of the definition of rave music (“wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”) in the UK's Criminal Justice Act. Although algorave musicians have been compared with DJs, they are in fact live musicians or improvisers, creating music live, usually by writing or modifying code, rather than mixing recorded music.\n\nAt an algorave the computer musician may not be the main point of focus for the audience and instead attention may be centered on a screen that displays live coding, that is the process of writing source code, so the audience can not just dance or listen to the music generated by the source code but also to see the process of programming.\n\nAlgorithmic approaches have long been applied in electronic dance music from the 1970s when Brian Eno established randomised musical practises which evolved into generative music over the course of his long career. This in turn influenced rave culture and techno of the 1990s by Farmers Manual, Autechre, and Aphex Twin. The Anti EP was an explicit response to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 - specifically the track \"flutter\" as a means of creating \"non-repetitive beats\" at raves which had been outlawed by the wording of the Act. The snare rush famously featured on the Girl/Boy EP of 1996 is an earlier form of digital algorhythmic coding and featured in drum and bass influenced electronic music of the early to mid 1990s, this approach later evolving into glitch music. Traditional use of algorithms include Maypole dancing, where they are applied to the dance itself as a form of Algorithmic Choreography and bell-ringing. The first self-proclaimed \"algorave\" was held in London as a warmup concert for the SuperCollider Symposium 2012. However the name was first coined in 2011, after live coders Nick Collins and Alex McLean tuned into a happy hardcore pirate radio station on the way to a performance in the UK. Since then, algorave has been growing into an international movement, with algoraves having been held mainly in Europe and Asia; and few events in Australia and North America.\n\nAlgorave can also be considered an international music movement with a community of electronic musicians, visual artists and developing technologies.

Supposedly, the cyclone struck Bombay on 6 June 1882. Though it is widely reported, even in scientific literature, historical research shows that it did not in fact happen.\n\nThe supposed cyclone is mentioned in academic literature from at least 1976. Its entry in the 2008 edition of the \"Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons, and Cyclones\" reads:\nThe Great Bombay Cyclone of June 6, 1882: One of few truly great Indian cyclones to have formed over the Arabian Sea, the Great Bombay Cyclone--engorged with 110-MPH (177-km/h) winds and an 18-foot (6-m) surge--reportedly claimed more than 100,000 lives when it came ashore at Bombay right before daybreak.\nA 2014 academic article claims that: 'the deadliest storm surge of Arabian sea was Great Bombay Cyclone, took place in 1882 causing 100,000 . It is one of ten deadliest tropical cyclones of the known history of the world'. Another account, published in 2017, says that\nthe city of Bombay was all but destroyed by a monster cyclone that slammed into the Maharashtra region on June 6th 1882. This was one of the few great storms to emerge from the Arabian Sea. The super storm covered an enormous area as it came ashore at dawn bringing with it 110 mile per hour winds and an 18 foot tidal surge that inundated much of the region around Bombay ... The resultant winds, flooding and damage to buildings killed more the 100,000 people.\nIt appears in other academic literature besides: some further examples are referenced here.\n\nAmitav Ghosh reports that research by Adam Sobel, along with a consultation by Murali Ranganathan of the contemporary Bombay newspaper \"Kaiser-i-Hind\" for the relevant period, shows no contemporary record of the event. If a storm of anything like the reported magnitude had happened, it would have killed about an eighth of Bombay's population, and would have been widely reported. There does appear to have been a storm with heavy rain and strong winds on 4 June 1882, but it does not answer to descriptions of the supposed cyclone of 6 June. Bombay's biggest cyclone event of the nineteenth century in fact appears to have been 'in 1854, when \"property valued at half-a-million pounds sterling\" was destroyed in four hours and a thousand people were killed'.\n"}

The 143rd episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 12, 2006. After \"Cartoon Wars Part I\", it is the second part of a two-episode story-arc, which focuses on Cartman's efforts to get the television series \"Family Guy\" cancelled, by exploiting fears of retaliation by Muslims to an impending \"Family Guy\" episode in which the Islamic prophet Muhammad will appear, in violation of some interpretations of Muslim law. Kyle instead urges the president of the network airing \"Family Guy\", Fox, to air the episode in an exercise of free speech.\n\nThe episodes were inspired by the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy, which began in response to a Danish newspaper's printing of cartoons depicting Muhammed in early 2006, leading to worldwide protests and occasionally violent demonstrations and riots. It also comes from \"South Park\" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone's general dislike of \"Family Guy\", which they viewed as overly reliant on cutaway gags as humor and less on story. During production, the duo ran into reluctance from Comedy Central and parent company Viacom, who felt their insistence to depict Muhammad disregarded concerns for public safety. Parker and Stone argued that the network was giving in to hypothetical violence, labeling them hypocrites due to their satirizing of other religions in the past. The network interference was written into the episode's storyline.\n\nComedy Central eventually aired the episode with a black title card during the Muhammad sequence, censoring the depiction. While the episode's censorship did attract headlines, it received more attention for its lampooning of \"Family Guy\". The episode received positive reviews from television critics.\n\nEric Cartman has an intense dislike for the television program \"Family Guy\". When he learns that an episode of the show is to feature a depiction of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, he exploits fears of retaliation to urge Fox, the network on which \"Family Guy\" airs, to pull the episode. Cartman pretends to be a sickly Danish kid with a broken leg, telling the Fox executives that his father was killed by terrorists during the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy and pleading that they pull the \"Family Guy\" episode. His story touches the executives, who encourage him to try to persuade the writers to yield. Kyle, who likes \"Family Guy\", arrives at the Fox Studio to foil Cartman's plans, but is knocked unconscious by an ally of Cartman's, a kid resembling Bart Simpson who, also wanting to destroy \"Family Guy\", restrains Kyle in a supply shed.\n\nCartman is introduced to the \"Family Guy\" writing staff, who turn out to be a group of manatees. The staff, who live in a large tank, pick up \"idea balls\" from a large pile of them, each of which has a different noun, a verb or a pop culture reference written on it, and deliver them, five at a time, to a machine that then forms a \"Family Guy\" cutaway gag based on those ideas. The manatees refuse to work if any idea ball is removed from their tank, making censorship an unfeasible practice with them. Cartman secretly removes a ball from their tank, causing them to stop working, and then convinces the Fox president that the manatees are spoiled, and abusing the executives' generosity. Cartman convinces the president that they need to show them who's boss. The president decides to pull the new \"Family Guy\" episode shortly before airtime. Cartman feels victorious, but Kyle shows up, saying he convinced the Bart-like kid to set him free.\n\nAfter a physical altercation between Cartman and Kyle, they both go to the Fox president's office. Kyle tells the president that Cartman has duped him into pulling the episode, and despite Cartman's brandishing of a gun, Kyle implores the president not to censor the episode. The network president ultimately decides, in spite of threats of violence from both Cartman and Islamic terrorists, that \"Family Guy\" should be aired, and without censorship. The \"Family Guy\" episode airs, and features Muhammad in a cutaway gag, handing Peter a \"salmon football helmet\", but the scene with Muhammad was cut by Comedy Central, and is replaced by a black screen and a title card reading, \"In this shot, Mohammed hands a football helmet to \"Family Guy\". Comedy Central has refused to broadcast an image of Mohammed on their network.\"\n\nTerrorist leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, reminding America that it was warned not to show Muhammad, initiates Al-Qaeda's retaliation — a crudely animated video depicting President George W. Bush, Carson Kressley, Tom Cruise, Katie Holmes, and Jesus Christ defecating on each other and the American flag. After the video ends, al-Zawahiri gloats of their \"retaliation\" by saying they \"burned\" the Americans and that it \"was way funnier than Family Guy.\"\n\nThe episode was largely inspired by the \"Jyllands-Posten\" Muhammad cartoons controversy, in which twelve editorial cartoons, most of which depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad, were published in the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\", leading to protests around the world in early 2006, including violent demonstrations and riots in some Muslim countries. The duo had wanted to create an episode centering on Muhammad months before that particular controversy flared. Parker gathered the episode’s title from a headline on a television news broadcast of the controversy: \"Breaking news: Cartoon wars. Muslims angered over cartoon.\" After the incidents, Parker and Stone wanted to include Muhammad \"just […] standing there\", as a harmless and not overtly offensive depiction. They felt \"100% sure\" that Comedy Central would back them up on their efforts, due to the duo's tendency to tackle serious subjects with humor and satire in the past.\n\nThe network was \"bummed\" when they learned of their intentions, but nonetheless, as \"South Park\" as a franchise made the network exorbitant amounts of money, they could not tell them no. According to Stone, Comedy Central was initially supportive of their vision, but backed away when executives in higher positions at parent company Viacom denied the request. As a result, \"Cartoon Wars Part II\" is largely based around real-life censorship they faced in producing the episode. The duo argued with Comedy Central that refusing to show images of Muhammad would be giving into violence; they were partially fascinated with this territory due to its creation of a new taboo, one informed by threats. In the episode, Kyle's impassioned plea to the president of Fox is culled from Parker and Stone's conversations with Comedy Central executives, and he even refers to the Fox president as \"Doug\", in reference to Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog. The network's reluctance to allow the images to be shown factored into the duo's decision to make the episode a two-parter; \"Well, they’re still not letting us show Muhammed […] we'll argue about it for another week\", said Parker. While the duo agreed that the network had the right to air whatever they want, they viewed their censorship as \"wimpy\".\n\nPart of Parker and Stone's anger came from the fact that \"Super Best Friends\", a 2001 episode of \"South Park\", featured images of Muhammad uncensored as a superhero, and aired without censorship for several years on both Comedy Central and in local syndication. The duo struggled to come up with how to present Comedy Central's refusal to broadcast the images as a real situation and not a joke. Parker later related previous South Park episodes, \"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\" (2000) and \"Trapped in the Closet\" (2005), which parodied NAMBLA and Scientology, respectively, as similar situations. \"You have to make sure, when you're doing that kind of subject matter, you want people to know what you're doing is a joke and then what really is real, you know, you're trying to make fun of\", said Parker. The duo, instead of settling on the black title card, toyed with \"putting some really incredible quote up or making a big speech. At the end of the day it felt a little too high and mighty, so we ended up doing the driest thing possible.\"\n\n\"Cartoon Wars Part II\" contains several cultural references. The episode parodies the Fox animated sitcom \"Family Guy\", which was revived from cancellation the previous year and attracted immense popularity. Parker stated, \"we totally understand that people love it, that's why we put it in the show, we understand that it speaks to some people and it can just be a simple laugh and that's great and we certainly don't think it should be taken off the air or anything like that, we just don't respect it in terms of writing\", later referring to the writers behind the show as \"smart\" but emphatically criticizing their overuse of \"gag-humor\".\n\nIn referencing \"Family Guy\", the episode also brings another Fox television sitcom into the equation: \"The Simpsons\". Following the airing of the episode's first part, the duo received flowers from the producers of \"The Simpsons\" and phone calls from those involved with \"King of the Hill\" at Fox (who remarked, in reference to their mocking of \"Family Guy\", \"you're doing God's work\"). Parker claimed that the majority of Hollywood at the time disliked the success of \"Family Guy\", both for what was viewed as subpar, lazy writing and for petty, jealous reasons, regarding its high ratings. As Parker and Stone immensely respected \"The Simpsons\", they incorporated the reactions into the episode, with Cartman meeting Bart Simpson, with whom he shares a dislike of \"Family Guy\". The duo also inserted a reference to the staff at \"King of the Hill\". \"There was this animation solidarity moment, where everyone did come together over their hatred of \"Family Guy\"\", Parker joked.\n\nThe episode's opening is self-referential; it is an homage to the controversy that erupted when the duo opened the second season of \"South Park\" in 1998 not with the conclusion to the \"Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut\" cliffhanger, but with an entirely different, unrelated episode revolving around the show-within-a-show characters Terrance and Phillip (\"Terrance and Phillip in Not Without My Anus\").\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding the image of Muhammad, the episode received high acclaim. Eric Goldman of IGN gave the episode a perfect review, with a score of 10 out of 10, saying, \"The really ironic thing here is that \"South Park\" actually already did show Mohammed prominently, in the \"Super Best Friends\" episode in 2001. Clearly Matt and Trey are also commenting on how times have changed, and how the acts of select extremists can create such specific fears in the powers that be; hammering home their point was the episode's conclusion, which featured terrorists responding to \"Family Guy\" with a cartoon of their own, showing Jesus defecating on George W. Bush and the American flag, which pointedly was shown without being censored.\" This episode also won an IGN Editors Choice Award. A 2011 review of the episode from \"The A.V. Club\" is part of a series that examines episodes that \"exemplify the spirit of its time and the properties that make television a unique medium\". Noel Murray writes that the episode \"slyly deals with censorship and public pressures of varying degrees—including some that are fairly discreet\".\n\nThe situation became one of life imitating art; in the week prior to the episode's airing, the teaser advertisement referenced the situation: \"Will television executives take a stand for free speech? Or will Comedy Central puss out?\" Comedy Central’s decision to censor the image was due to concerns for public safety. The network issued a short statement the day following the episode’s airing: “In light of recent world events, we feel we made the right decision.” \"Cartoon Wars\" followed only weeks after another religious run-in with the network, in which Comedy Central pulled a rerun of the season nine episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" due its apparent mocking of Scientology. Stone publicly criticized Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog's decision as \"cowardly\" in \"Daily Variety\".\n\nFollowing the episode’s airing, the ending attracted publicity, often misrepresenting and simplifying the segment’s theme and message and sensationalizing the appearances of Jesus and President George W. Bush. The episode aired during the Holy Week for Christians, prompting outrage from that community over the portrayal of Jesus. Brent Bozell, founder of the conservative organization Parents Television Council, criticized Viacom for celebrating insults to Christianity through the satirical anti-American scene in this episode, as well as another animated series insulting Catholicism, \"Popetown\", which aired on MTV Germany, another Viacom-owned network. William Anthony Donohue of the Catholic League criticized Stone and Parker. \"The ultimate hypocrite is not Comedy Central — that's their decision not to show the image of Muhammad or not — it's Parker and Stone\", he said. \"Like little whores, they'll sit there and grab the bucks. They'll sit there and they'll whine and they'll take their shot at Jesus. That's their stock in trade.\" In response to these criticisms, Parker and Stone agreed with these groups, noting that while images of Muhammed were forbidden, it instead appeared to be “open season” on Jesus, hence their depiction to illustrate the hypocrisy of the network. The duo subsequently made Donohue a villain in the 2007 episode \"Fantastic Easter Special\".\n\nThe episode became notorious not for its lampooning of censorship and the Muhammad controversy, but for its criticism of \"Family Guy\". \"You’d think [Muhammad] would be the flashpoint. But no. It’s \"Family Guy\" everyone’s talking about (at least, in this hemisphere)\", said Scott Brown of \"Entertainment Weekly\". The duo were disappointed upon their realization that fans cared less about their opinions on censorship and freedom of speech, but rather their fixation on Tom Cruise and the controversy surrounding \"Trapped in the Closet\".\n\nFollowing the episode's broadcast, \"Harper's Magazine\" approached the duo to print their uncensored, original image of Muhammad in an issue, but Comedy Central would not approve of the request. \"\"Harper's\" is in every Barnes & Noble, every Borders in the country now. I saw it in the airport. It has all the Danish cartoons, and nothing happened. The risks were totally overestimated, I thought\", said Stone.\n\nAt a Television Critics Association (TCA) discussion in July 2006, Herzog responded to criticism directed at him:\n\nStone referred to the episode's censorship as \"really, beyond creatively disappointing […] because we thought we could do something really important.\"\n\n\"Cartoon Wars Part II\", along with the thirteen other episodes from \"South Park\"s tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "606261", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=606261", "title": "Curtain Theatre", "text": "Curtain Theatre\n\nThe Curtain Theatre was an Elizabethan playhouse located in Hewett Street, Shoreditch (part of the modern London Borough of Hackney), just outside the City of London. It opened in 1577, and continued staging plays until 1624.\n\nThe Curtain was built some south of London's first playhouse, The Theatre, which had opened a year before, in 1576. It was called the \"Curtain\" because it was located near a plot of land called Curtain Close, not because of the sort of front curtain associated with modern theatres, but of its proximity of the City walls, curtain or curtain wall referring to the part of city walls between two bastions. Its remains were rediscovered in archaeological excavation in 2012. The most significant find was that the Curtain was rectangular not round. They found a stage, and evidence of a tunnel under the stage and galleries at the first floor level. Finds included a ceramic bird whistle; ceramic money boxes for collecting entry fees; beads likely for decorating stage costumes and a small statue of Bacchus.\n\nThe Curtain Theatre was built in 1577 in Shoreditch, and was London's second playhouse. Little is known of the companies that performed there, or of the plays they performed. The first clear mention of the Curtain is in 1584, when the City of London petitioned the parish of Shoreditch to shut down their playhouses. The proprietor appears to have been Henry Lanman, described as a \"gentleman\": in 1585, Lanman made an agreement with the proprietor of the Theatre, James Burbage, to use the Curtain as a supplementary house, or \"easer,\" to the more prestigious older playhouse. From 1597 to 1599, it became the premier venue of Shakespeare's Company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men, who had been forced to leave their former playing space at The Theatre after the latter closed in 1596. It was the venue of several of Shakespeare's plays, including \"Romeo and Juliet\" (which gained \"Curtain plaudits\") and \"Henry IV\" Part I and Part II. The Lord Chamberlain's Men also performed Ben Jonson's \"Every Man in His Humour\" here in 1598, with Shakespeare in the cast. Later that same year Jonson gained a certain notoriety by killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel in nearby Hoxton Fields.\n\nThe Lord Chamberlain's Men departed the Curtain when the Globe Theatre, which they built to replace the Theatre, was ready for use in 1599. For seven years Henry Lanman (owner of the Curtain) had an agreement with James Burbage (owner of the Theatre) that all profit would be shared between them. This deal is how many believe Lanman was able to afford to open the Curtain, the rest is all very unclear. J. Leeds Barroll focuses in \"Shakespeare studies: An annual gathering of Research, Criticism and Reviews\" on the fact that Henry Lanman had offered the Curtain as an easer to James Burbage, proprietor of the Theatre. Thereby, he assumes that Lanman’s business, the Curtain, must have been doing as well as Burbage’s business, the Theatre, since both, Lanman and Burbage, had agreed on a pooling arrangement for seven years in 1585, to pool profits. As far as is known, Lanman ran the Curtain as a private concern for the first phase of its existence; He died in 1606 and it is assumed by Edmund Chambers that the theatre had been re-arranged into a shareholder’s enterprise before his death at some point. Thomas Pope, one of the Lord Chamberlain's Men, owned a share in the Curtain and left it to his heirs in his last will and testament in 1603. King's Men member John Underwood did the same in 1624. The fact that both of these shareholders belonged to Shakespeare's company may indicate that the re-organization of the Curtain occurred when the Lord Chamberlain's Men were acting there. Otherwise, it would be very unwise of Burbage to pool profits if he did better in the first place. Thus, the suggestion is given that both proprietors were doing equal business. Burbage's father Richard had shares in the theatre at the time of his death.\n\nThe London theatres, including the Curtain, were closed for much of the period from September 1592 to April 1594 due to the bubonic plague. In 1597, people wrote to the local magistrates' court demanding that no plays take place at the Curtain or the Theatre that year. The Curtain was named in John Stow's \"Survey of London\" in 1598, but was not listed in the 1603 edition. In 1600, the Privy Council tried unsuccessfully to shut down the Curtain theatre, and in 1603, the Curtain became the playhouse of Queen Anne's Men (formerly known as Worcester's Men, and formerly at the Rose Theatre, where they'd played Heywood's \"A Woman Kill'd With Kindness\" in February of that year). In 1607, \"The Travels of the Three English Brothers,\" by Rowley, Day, and Wilkins, was performed at the Curtain.\n\nThe Curtain was in use from 1577 until at least 1624, after which its ultimate fate is obscure as there is no record of it after 1627. The reasons for its closure are not known.\n\nThe Curtain was believed to have been built near The Theatre, but the exact location was for many years unknown. However, a commemorative plaque was erected at 18 Hewett Street.\n\nIn 2012, archaeologists from MOLA (Museum of London Archaeology) announced that they had discovered the remains of the theatre during trial excavations. In 2013 plans were submitted to develop the site with a 40-storey tower of 400 apartments plus Shakespeare museum, 250-seat outdoor auditorium and park, with the archaeological remains visible in a glass enclosure. Completion of the project is expected in 2019.\n\nIn May 2016, excavators announced that the theatre was purpose built and, unusually, the theatre was rectangular rather than round or polygonal. Walls survived up to high in places; MOLA identified the courtyard, where theatregoers stood, and the inner walls, which held the galleries. The theatre had timber galleries with mid and upper areas for wealthier audience members, and a courtyard made from compacted gravel for those with less to spend. The galleries were straight.\n\nAlso uncovered was a fragmentary ceramic bird whistle, dating from the late 16th century. This raised the question of whether the bird whistle was merely a Tudor toy or a prop for plays that needed sound effects. In November 2016, a tunnel structure - accessed by doors on either end of the stage - was unearthed, which would have allowed actors to exit from one side and come on again from the other without being seen by the audience. Fragments of ceramic money boxes were found, which would have been used to collect entry fees from theatregoers, before being taken to an office to be smashed and the money counted - this office was known as the ‘box office’, which is the origin of the term we use today.\n\nGlass beads and pins were unearthed along with drinking vessels and clay pipes. The team also came across a mount and a token, as well as personal items, including a bone comb.\n\nA reconstruction of the Curtain Theatre features in the 1998 film \"Shakespeare in Love\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "56921904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56921904", "title": "History of children in the military", "text": "History of children in the military\n\nChildren in the military are children (defined by the Convention on the Rights of the Child as persons under the age of 18) who are associated with military organizations, such as state armed forces and non-state armed groups. Throughout history and in many cultures, children have been involved in military campaigns. For example, thousands of children participated on all sides of the First World War and the Second World War. Children may be trained and used for combat, assigned to support roles such as porters or messengers, or used for tactical advantage as human shields or for political advantage in propaganda.\n\nChildren are easy targets for military recruitment due to their greater susceptibility to influence compared to adults. Some children are recruited by force while others choose to join up, often to escape poverty or because they expect military life to offer a rite of passage to maturity.\n\nThroughout history and in many cultures, children have been extensively involved in military campaigns.\n\nThe earliest mentions of minors being involved in wars come from antiquity. It was customary for youths in the Mediterranean basin to serve as aides, charioteers and armor bearers to adult warriors. Examples of this practice can be found in the Bible, such as David's service to King Saul, in Hittite and ancient Egyptian art, and in ancient Greek mythology (such as the story of Hercules and Hylas), philosophy and literature. In a practice dating back to antiquity, children were routinely taken on a campaign, together with the rest of a military man's family, as part of the baggage.\n\nThe Roman Empire made use of youths in war, though it was understood that it was unwise and cruel to use children in war, and Plutarch implies that regulations required youths to be at least sixteen years of age. Despite this, several Roman legionaries were known to have enlisted aged 14 in the Imperial Roman army, such as Quintus Postunius Solus who completed 21 years of service in Legio XX Valeria Victrix, and Caecilius Donatus who served 26 years in the Legio XX and died shortly before his honorable discharge.\n\nIn medieval Europe young boys from about twelve years of age were used as military aides (\"squires\"), though in theory their role in actual combat was limited. The so-called Children's Crusade in 1212 recruited thousands of children as untrained soldiers under the assumption that divine power would enable them to conquer the enemy, although none of the children entered combat. According to the legend, they were instead sold into slavery. While most scholars no longer believe that the Children's Crusade consisted solely, or even mostly, of children, it nonetheless exemplifies an era in which entire families took part in a war effort.\n\nYoung boys often took part in battles during early modern warfare. When Napoleon was faced with invasion by a massive Allied force in 1814 he conscripted many teenagers for his armies. Orphans of the Imperial Guard fought in the Netherlands with Marshal MacDonald and were between the ages of 14 and 17. Many of the conscripts who reported to the ranks in 1814 were referred to as Marie Louises after the Empress Marie Louise of France; they were also known as \"The Infants of the Emperor\". These soldiers were in their mid-teens. One of their more visible roles was as the ubiquitous \"drummer boy\".\n\nDuring the age of sail, young boys formed part of the crew of British Royal Navy ships and were responsible for many essential tasks including bringing powder and shot from the ship's magazine to the gun crews. These children were called \"powder monkeys.\"\n\nDuring the American Civil War a young boy, Bugler John Cook, served in the US Army at the age of 15 and received the Medal of Honor for his acts during the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in American history. Several other minors, including 11-year-old Willie Johnston, have also received the Medal of Honor.\n\nBy a law signed by Nicholas I of Russia in 1827 a disproportionate number of Jewish boys, known as the cantonists, were forced into military training establishments to serve in the army. The 25-year conscription term officially commenced at the age of 18, but boys as young as eight were routinely taken to fulfill the quota. \n\nIn the final stages of the Paraguayan War, children fought in the Battle of Acosta Ñu against the Allied forces of Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay. The day is commemorated as a national holiday in Paraguay.\n\nDuring the Boshin War, the pro-\"shōgun\" Aizu Domain formed the , which was made up of the 16 to 17-year-old sons of Aizu samurai. During the Battle of Bonari Pass and the Battle of Aizu they fought the Satcho forces who supported the Imperial cause. A detached unit of Byakkotai was cut off from the rest of the unit and retreated to Iimori Hill, which overlooked Aizu-Wakamatsu Castle. From there, they saw what they thought was the castle on fire. 20 of the detached unit committed \"seppuku\" while one was unsuccessful. He was saved by a local peasant.\n\nThe youngest known soldier of World War I was Momčilo Gavrić, who joined the 6th Artillery Division of the Serbian Army at the age of 8, after Austro-Hungarian troops in August 1914 killed his parents, grandmother, and seven of his siblings.\n\nIn the West, boys as young as 12 were caught up in the overwhelming tide of patriotism and in huge numbers enlisted for active service. Others enlisted to avoid harsh and dreary lives. Typically many were able to pass themselves off as older men, such as George Thomas Paget, who at 17 joined a Bantam battalion in the Welsh Regiment. The last surviving combat veteran of the War was Claude Choules, who enlisted in the Royal Navy at age 14 and saw his first action at the Battle of Jutland at 15. In the Gallipoli campaign, otherwise known as \"Çanakkale\", children as young as 15 fought in the trenches. 120 children fought in the \"15'liler\" or \"The 15s\" company, with no known survivors.\n\nMany child soldiers fought in the Spanish Civil War:\n\nIn World War II children under the age of 18 were widely used by all sides in formal and informal military roles. Children were readily indoctrinated into the prevailing ideology of the warring parties, quickly trained, and often sent to the front line; many were wounded or killed. The lack of a legal definition of a child, combined with the absence of a system for verifying the ages of prospective child recruits, contributed to the extensive use of children in the war.\n\nThese are historical examples. For instances of children in the military today, see Children in the military.\n\nDuring the Algerian civil war (1991–2002) children were recruited frequently by Islamist armed groups fighting the government. A government-allied militia—the Legitimate Defence Groups (LDG)—also used children, according to some reports. Although the rules for joining the LDG were the same as the army, in which only adults were recruited (by conscription) the LDG applied no safeguards to ensure that children could not join up. The extent of child recruitment during the war remains unknown.\n\nChildren were kidnapped and used extensively during the civil war of 1993–2005. In 2004 hundreds of child soldiers were in the Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL), an armed rebel, Hutu group. Children between the ages of 10 and 16 were also conscripted by the Burundese military.\n\nAfter the Arusha peace accord of 2001 and the Pretoria agreement of 2003 eventually brought the conflict to an end in 2005, the new constitution committed to not using children in direct combat. The parties to the conflict no longer recruited children in large numbers, but many remained active in the FNL, which had denounced the peace accord.\n\nBy 2006, a reintegration program organized by UNICEF had led to the release of 3,000 children from the military and armed groups. According to Child Soldiers International:The majority of those [children] who took part in the program returned to farm and fish in their local communities, but nearly 600 returned to school. Some 1,800 former child soldiers received occupational training. Health care was provided for those with special needs and psychosocial support was provided through individual and group meetings., Burundi no longer appears on the UN list of countries where children are used in hostilities.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2012, children were used extensively by the Chadian military as participants in armed conflict. They were also integrated into various rebel forces, including the United Front for Democratic Change (\"Front Uni pour le Changement\", FUC), local self-defense forces known as \"Tora Boro\" militias, and two Sudanese rebel movements operating in Chad: the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM) and the G-19 faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army (SLA). After the government signed an action plan with the United Nations, children were released from service and were no longer recruited. By 2014, Chad had been removed from the UN list of countries that use child soldiers in war.\n\nDuring Côte d’Ivoire’s civil war of 2002–2004, \"children were recruited, often forcibly, by both sides\", and were also abducted by armed groups fighting the civil war in Liberia between 1999 and 2003. The \"Patriotic Youth –\" armed groups that included children in large numbers – received the active support of the government. Thousands of children saw membership of an armed group on either side of the war as a way to earn a living, although they were often unpaid, having to acquire money through extortion or begging. They were provided with automatic weapons, and girls were frequently abducted as sex slaves.\n\nAttempts to reach a peace agreement repeatedly failed, and although after 2006 children were gradually released from military groups, approximately 2,000 children remained. After President Laurent Gbagbo refused to recognise the 2010 election result, fighting flared up again and child recruitment increased. Under the new government, however, the UN brokered an Action Plan that included the release of all children and, in 2015, the UN reported that children were no longer recruited in the country.\n\nDuring its 30-year war for independence with Ethiopia (1961–1991) the Eritrean People’s Liberation Front was \"widely acknowledged\" to have used children extensively as soldiers, according to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International). Once independence had been won, the Eritrean armed forces recruited and used children again during the two-year border war with Ethiopia in 1998. There were many reports of child recruitment and use (including conscription from age 15), but there is little information today about the extent of the practice, which is due in part to the absence of effective birth registration and age-verification system at the time.\n\nThe UN reported in 2002 that children were no longer being used systematically by the Eritrean armed forces, and the government acceded to the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005. Child recruitment continued, however; Human Rights Concern Eritrea reported in 2013 that all schoolchildren in 11 grade (approx. age 16) were made to spend the year at a military training camp, after which they were routinely recruited into the armed forces.\n\nAccording to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers in 2001 there were \"credible reports\" that the Ethiopian armed forces used thousands of children in its two-year border war with Eritrea between 1998 and 2000:Testimonies of former child soldiers, NGOs and journalists provide evidence of child deployment on the front lines and in massive waves across mine fields... Recruitment reportedly focused on Oromos and Somalis... and on grades 9 to 12 of secondary schools.Children were also forcibly recruited in groups from public places. The lack of a functioning birth registration system has made it difficult to estimate the number of children affected, but it is clear that the use of children was widespread; for example, most Ethiopian prisoners of war in one large prisoner of war camp in Eritrea were estimated to be aged 14–18.\n\nThe main opposition group in the 1990s, the Oromo Liberation Front, also systematically recruited children, including by force.\n\nIn 2008 it was reported that children were no longer used for military purposes in Ethiopia, and in 2014 the government ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.\n\nIn Liberia’s civil wars (1989–1995, 1999–2003) all factions abducted children for direct combat, forced labour, and sexual slavery. It was the common practice of commanders to give children drugs and threaten them with execution in order to enhance their obedience; for example, soldiers were frequently given valium before a battle, known as \"bubbles\" or \"10-10\". Children were often persuaded or forced to commit grave human rights violations against civilians, including rape, torture, and the abduction of other children for military use. Children as young as 10 were used in direct combat.\n\nUnited Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programs repeatedly failed when children quitted them, often to return to their former military unit, and after fighters rioted in protest at the absence of a financial reward for being disarmed. A chronic lack of resources for reintegration also prompted child soldiers to enrol in other armed groups as a means of gainful employment. By 2004 more than 20,000 children needed to be demobilised and reunited with their communities. However, by October 2004 10,000 children had been released from their military units and were part of reintegration programs. \n\nBy 2006 children were no longer being used by any military groups in the country, although armed groups from Côte d'Ivoire and Guinea continued to abduct Liberian children. , children were no longer being used for military purposes in Liberia, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18. \n\nThe use of child soldiers in Liberia was epitomised by The Small Boys Unit, established by Liberian President Charles Taylor. The boys were not provided with sustenance, but were expected to engage in \"snake patrol\", looting surrounding villages. Taylor and others were later tried before the Special Court for Sierra Leone because of his involvement in recruiting child soldiers.\n\nAn estimated 20,000 children took part in hostilities during the 1990s, including the 1994 Rwanda genocide when many children were involved in committing atrocities. 5,000 children were in the national army, while others, including many street children, joined or were made to join armed groups. After the genocide, 4,500 children were detained on suspicion of participating in atrocities, and were incarcerated for several years without charge or trial; some were sent to the Gitagata Re-Education Centre for males below 14 years of age. In the late 1990s, children were widely recruited again, often by force, to fight in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\n\nInitial demobilisation and reintegration programmes failed after many schools banned former child soldiers and a high rate of unemployment rendered them vulnerable to re-recruitment by militia groups. In 2003, as the Rwandan military presence in the DRC reduced, so did the demand for child soldiers. The government introduced new legislation to raise the minimum enlistment age 18 and the armed forces stopped recruiting children. Nonetheless, armed groups continued to do so, albeit to a reduced extent, for their operations in the DRC.\n\nDuring the Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) thousands of children were recruited by government armed forces and non-government armed groups, particularly the anti-government Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and the pro-government Civil Defence Forces (CDF).\n\nChildren were often forcibly recruited, given drugs and used to commit atrocities. Thousands of girls were also recruited as soldiers and often subjected to sexual exploitation. Many of the children were survivors of attacks on villages, which were routinely ordered to hand over their children to armed groups. By 2001, an estimated 10,000 children were being used for military purposes by government armed forces and various armed groups, particularly the RUF.\n\nAfter 2002, when the war was declared over, an extensive United Nations disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration programme reunited most former child soldiers with their communities, although it drew criticism for neglecting the needs of women and girls.\n\nIn June 2007 the Special Court for Sierra Leone found three men from the rebel Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law, including the recruitment of children under the age of 15 years into the armed forces. With this the Special Court became the first ever UN-backed tribunal to secure a conviction for the military conscription of children. \n\n, children were no longer being used for military purposes in Sierra Leone, and its armed forces were recruiting only adults over the age of 18.\n\nIn his book \"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Child Soldier\", Ishmael Beah chronicles his life during the conflict in Sierra Leone. In \"Armies of the Young: Child Soldiers in War and Terrorism\" anthropologist David M. Rosen discusses the murders, rapes, tortures, and thousands of amputations committed by the RUF Small Boys Unit. The film \"Blood Diamond\" is set during the civil war. The issue is also explored in the \"Bones\" episode, \"The Survivor In The Soap\".\n\nOver a period of twenty years the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted more than 30,000 boys and girls as soldiers or sex slaves. Joseph Kony began the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in 1987, originally to protect northern Ugandans from the 1986 military coup by the People's National Resistance Army. Stating that he \"received messages from God\" Kony began attacking his own people, the Acholi, to establish a new theocratic government in Uganda based on the principles of the \"Ten Commandments of God\". This attempt by the LRA to gain control of the Ugandan government via roaming armies used boy- as well as girl-children as soldiers, such as Grace Akallo.\n\nThe LRA expansion into South Sudan, the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo has used large numbers of children as active combatants and participants in extreme violence. On the 21October 2008 an appeal by the UN Security Council was made asking for the LRA to cease all military action in the DRC immediately. On 14June 2002 Uganda deposited its instrument of ratification of the Rome Statute, and on 16December 2003 the Government of Uganda referred the situation concerning northern Uganda to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The ICC investigated the situation and on 14October 2005 issued indictments against Lord's Resistance Army leader Joseph Kony and four other commanders for war crimes: Vincent Otti; Raska Lukwiya (indictment terminated, deceased); Okot Odhiambo; and Dominic Ongwen. The warrant for Kony, Otti and Odhiambo includes the alleged crime of the forced enlisting of children contrary to the Rome Statute Art. 8(2) (e)(vii).\n\nThe National Resistance Army also made use of child soldiers. Between 2003 and 2007, non-state armed groups fighting the LRA also used children.\n\nIn 2007 the Ugandan government agreed an action plan with the UN to end the use of child soldiers and in 2008 the country no longer appeared on the UN list of countries that recruit and use children.\n\nDuring the civil war between 1980 and 1992 the Salvadoran military and the main opposition group, the \"Frente Farabundo Martí de Liberación National\" (FMLN)\",\" recruited children extensively. The recruitment was frequently carried out by force and focused on economically suppressed regions. A fifth of the army’s personnel were aged under 18, as were a quarter of the FMLN. In a group of 278 former FMLN child soldiers interviewed for a study, the average age of recruitment was 10 years. The large majority of child recruits on both sides were living in poverty, and had been largely deprived of formal education. Many children who were not recruited by force joined of their own volition, mainly either to improve their circumstances or because they believed in the cause. \n\nAfter the civil war came to a close, rehabilitation and reintegration programmes for children mostly failed; the majority of FMLN children were not involved in them, and the large majority of those who were dropped out of them. A decade after the peace accord former child soldiers were still experiencing nightmares, depression, anxiety, and related signs of psychiatric trauma. \n\nToday, the Salvadoran military no longer sends children to war, but it still recruits and trains them from the age of 16.\n\nDuring the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988) the armed forces used children widely; the extent of the practice is not known but the number of children involved is thought to be in the tens of thousands. Armed groups associated with the government advertised widely for children from age 14 to join them, and the country's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, urged children to fight at the front. According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers (now Child Soldiers International):Ayatollah Khomeini declared that parental permission was unnecessary for those going to the front, that volunteering for military duty was a religious obligation, and that serving in the armed forces took priority over all other forms of work or study. Various sources reported that children were indoctrinated into participating in combat. They were given \"keys to paradise\" and promised that they would go directly to heaven if they died as martyrs against the Iraqi enemy.The children involved were overwhelmingly from slums and poor villages, and some participated without the knowledge of their parents, including Mohammad Hossein Fahmideh. Thousands of children took part in human wave attacks, leading to widespread deaths and injuries. The total number of all Iranian casualties is estimated to be 200,000–600,000, of which approximately a third were aged 15–19 (and 3 percent under 14), according to one assessment.\n\nAfter the war, the \"Basij,\" an official militia organisation, continued to recruit children from age 15, focusing on those living in poverty and sometimes recruiting them by force. In 2004, the \"Basij\" was estimated to have as many as a million members of all ages. \"Ansar-e Hizbollah\", an armed group tolerated by the government, also recruited children widely in the 2000s, with no age restriction. , the Iranian armed forces continue to enlist from age 16 and the government has not yet ratified the Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict.\n\nThe government of Saddam Hussein maintained 'boot camps' of civilian youths between the ages of 12 and 17 that involved small arms training and Ba'athist political indoctrination. Iraqi opposition sources and the US State Department reported that children who refused faced punishment. The state incorporated children as young as ten into the \"Futuwah\" and \"Ashbal Saddam\" youth movements and then subjected them to military training, sometimes for 14 hours a day. P. W. Singer has compared the groups to the \"Hitler Jugend\". In the Gulf War 12-year-old boys fought for the Iraqis. Children also participated in the Iran–Iraq War.\n\nIn the 2003 invasion of Iraq, US forces fought children at Nasariya, Karbala, and Kirkuk, and the US sent captured child combatants to Abu Ghraib prison. In 2009 a UN report on the post-war Iraqi occupation stated that the Iraqi insurgency had used children as combatants; it noted, for example, a suicide attack against Kirkuk's police commander by a boy aged between 10 and 13. \n\nIn the 1970s the \"Khmer Rouge\" exploited thousands of desensitised, conscripted children in their early teens to commit mass murder and other atrocities during the Cambodian civil war and subsequent genocide. The indoctrinated children were taught to follow any order without hesitation. After it was deposed in 1979, the \"Khmer Rouge\" fought a guerrilla war against the new government, and until at least 1998 relied heavily on child recruits, including forced recruitment by abduction. During this period, the children were deployed mainly in unpaid support roles, such as ammunition-carriers, and also as combatants.\n\nCambodia's state armed forces also recruited children widely. Throughout the 1990s the army was recruiting children from the age of 10 and using them in armed conflict, mainly as porters and spies, and also as combatants. Four percent of the army were children, according to an estimate in the \"Cambodia Daily\". Many children had fled the \"Khmer Rouge\" without a means to feed themselves and hoped that joining the government forces would enable them to survive, although local commanders frequently denied them any pay. Children often capitalised on the lack of an effective birth registration system to lie about their age in order to enlist. Other children, some as young as 8, were forced to join.\n\nBy 2000, the Cambodian government had signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict and its armed forces resolved to recruit adults only. Meanwhile, the \"Khmer Rouge\" had collapsed with the death of its leader, Pol Pot, in 1998. By 2004, children were no longer being recruited in the country, although the demobilisation programmes were inadequate, according to UNICEF, failing to offer appropriate rehabilitative support to released children.\n\nBetween 1983 and 2009 Sri Lanka’s government fought a civil war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Tamil Tigers). For its entire duration the Tamil Tigers and other armed groups made routine use of child recruits, typically aged 14–17 and sometimes under 10. Some children enlisted to escape deprivation or racism, or during compulsory military training at their school when they were exposed to recruitment propaganda. Others were recruited by force when walking home from school or after the Tigers pressurised families to surrender one child, as per its policy. In 2001, international sources estimated that 40 percent of Tamil Tiger personnel were children, contrary to official statements insisting that the organisation did not use them. Sri Lankan soldiers nicknamed one unit the \"Baby Battalion\", due to the number of children in it. Although state armed forces recruited only adults over the age of 18, they supported the Karuna group, a Tamil splinter organisation opposed to the Tamil Tigers, to recruit children by force. The government also used detained Tamil Tiger children for propaganda by exposing them to the media.\n\nThe first international initiative to demobilise and reintegrate children into their communities began in 2003, but was halted in 2004 because the Tigers failed to keep their commitment to release children from their ranks. The organisation began to release children in 2004, but continued to enlist several thousand, albeit in progressively smaller numbers, until at least 2007. The Tamil Tigers were defeated in 2009 and all other parties to the conflict stopped recruiting children in the same year.\n\nDuring the First Chechen War, Chechen separatist forces included a large number of boys and girls, some as young as 11. According to the UN: \"Child soldiers in Chechnya were reportedly assigned the same tasks as adult combatants, and served on the front lines soon after joining the armed forces.\" In 2004 under-18s were still believed to be involved in a range of armed groups in the war against Russia; some allegedly took part in suicide bombings.\n\nChildren aged 17 were sent to the Falklands War in 1982 (where three were killed) and the Gulf War in 1990–91 (where two were killed). 17-year-olds were also deployed as NATO peacekeepers in the former Yugoslavia during the 1990s. Having initially resisted international negotiations to prevent the deployment of children, the UK agreed to deploy adults only when it signed the Optional Protocol on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict in 2000, but remained committed to recruiting and training children from age 16. Between 2003 and 2010 22 personnel aged 17 were sent to Afghanistan and Iraq, reportedly in error.\n\nDuring the Troubles in Northern Ireland (c. 1960s to 1998) it was common for paramilitary groups to recruit and use children, including as combatants. Five children in Republican paramilitary groups, seven in Loyalist paramilitary groups, and five in the British armed forces, died during the conflict. The youngest, Cathleen McCartland, was recruited by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and was aged 12 when she was killed in Belfast.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Most centred on refereeing.\n\nIn the second leg of the qualification play-off match between France and the Republic of Ireland on 18 November 2009, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee and other match officials, illegally handled the ball twice in the lead up to the winning goal. The incident caused widespread debate about FIFA Fair Play, and how matches should be refereed at the highest level. The Football Association of Ireland (FAI) requested a replay of the game on grounds of fairness, but was denied by FIFA under the Laws of the Game. On 2 December, FIFA called an extraordinary general meeting of the Executive Committee to discuss various issues, with the Henry incident high on the agenda. FIFA announced they would be setting up an inquiry into technology and extra officials in the game, but they did not announce a widely expected move of the fast-tracked introduction of goal-line referee's assistants, already being trialed in the UEFA Europa League, and confirmed the competition in South Africa would be officiated as normal with a referee, two assistants, and a fourth official. On the subject of fair Play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:\n\nOn 5 June 2015 it was determined that the Football Association of Ireland were paid €5 million by FIFA not to protest Thierry Henry handball.\n\nPlans to slaughter a cow at each stadium to be used for the World Cup generated concern among animal rights groups. The Makhonya Royal Trust proposed the concept stating the cattle killing event was a \"true African\" way of blessing the tournament.\n\nThe issue of cattle sacrifice was discussed by a High Court. Judge Nic Van der Reyden said the matter needed to be taken up by politicians.\n\nAn ox was slaughtered at Johannesburg's Soccer City stadium on 25 May. A place was created within the Soccer City precinct to act as a \"kraal\" where the ox was slaughtered. After that, the senior traditional healers walked into the stadium in song, drum-beating and dance, where they continued to bless the inside of the stadium with rituals.\n\nBrazilian striker Luís Fabiano handled the ball twice in the build-up to Brazil's second goal, which helped Brazil win the match 3–1. Brazilian midfielder Kaká was sent off late in the game for a collision with Ivorian midfielder Kader Keïta. Replays showed Keïta had run into Kaká's side, deliberately striking Kaká's shoulder, and then fell to the ground holding his face in a successful attempt to have Kaká sent off.\n\nWith the match tied 2–2 in the 86th minute, Maurice Edu of the United States appeared to score the winning goal from a set piece, but referee Koman Coulibaly disallowed the goal and awarded a free-kick to Slovenia. Because Coulibaly had blown for the free-kick before the goal had been scored, he was not required to (and did not) explain the call on the pitch or to FIFA officials afterwards. Replays showed numerous Slovenian players pulling and hanging on Americans, fighting for position in the box, but no foul or offsides by the Americans was apparent to justify disallowing the goal. US striker Robbie Findley was also given a mysterious yellow card, which resulted in him missing the next match against Algeria. Although the match ended in a 2–2 draw, the United States ultimately went on to win the group. Coulibaly received a \"poor\" performance review for the match and was selected to only one additional match in the tournament, as the 4th referee.\n\nAfter the previous two matches, both had a chance of qualifying. However, with the other game being Ghana vs. Germany, Serbia seemingly had the better chance to advance to the next round (due to a superior head-to-head record against likely group winners Germany). During the last minutes of the match, with Serbia losing 2-1, Australia's Tim Cahill clearly hit the ball with his hand in the box, but the officials decided not to award a penalty for Serbia, and play continued; also Serbia had a late goal disallowed for what appeared to be a questionable offside. With Ghana losing to Germany 1–0, a second goal would have given Serbia runners-up spot in the group and advancement to the Round of 16.\n\nOn 27 June, during two round of 16 matches, two incidents occurred that led to renewed debate over the lack of video technology in refereeing– the disallowing of England midfielder Frank Lampard's goal against Germany, and an Argentinian goal against Mexico that was allowed despite being scored from an offside position.\n\nDuring England's 4–1 loss to Germany, Lampard's shot hit the crossbar and then crossed the goal-line before bouncing back out to German goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. Linesman Mauricio Espinosa and referee Jorge Larrionda did not award the goal but subsequent replays and photographic evidence showed the ball had indeed crossed the goal-line. This incident reignited demands for goal-line technology.\n\nDuring the Argentina vs. Mexico match Carlos Tevez scored from an offside position from within the Mexican penalty box when the game stood at 0–0. Although against FIFA's ruling, the big screens inside Soccer City showed replays of Tevez more than a yard offside when Lionel Messi played the ball towards him. The goal stood, causing uproar and protests from the Mexican players. Referee Roberto Rosetti stuck with his decision. Argentina subsequently won the match 3–1. Following the Argentinian goal, BBC commentators wrote that \"linesman Stefano Ayroldi [...] somehow allowed Carlos Tevez's goal to stand before a ridiculous situation developed where he, referee Roberto Rosetti and everyone in the stadium watched replays on the huge screens show exactly how far offside Tevez was\"; pundit Alan Hansen added: \"Before today I was not an advocate of technology in football, but now I am a convert.\" Associated Press sports columnist John Leicester reacted to the match between England and Germany by writing:\n\nThe press spoke of:\n\nA few days later, FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated that he deplored the \"evident referee mistakes\" in England vs. Germany and Mexico vs. Argentina matches, and apologised to the English and Mexican football federations (\"the two federations directly concerned by referee's mistakes\"). He added: \"It is obvious that after the experiences so far at this World Cup it would be a nonsense not to re-open the file on goal-line technology. [...] We will come out with a new model in November on how to improve high-level referees. [...] I cannot disclose more of what we are doing but something has to be changed.\"\n\nIn a quarter-final match against Ghana, Uruguayan striker Luis Suárez handled the ball to prevent a last minute Ghana goal. Suárez was shown a red card and Ghana's Asamoah Gyan missed the resulting penalty kick. Ghana subsequently lost the match, 4–2, in the penalty shootout.\n\nThe African press named Uruguay public enemy No.1 and described them as cheats.\n\nThe French team had significant troubles with team dissension at the World Cup. The press was strongly critical of both players and coaches. This followed a highly disappointing UEFA Euro 2008 first round exit, and a difficult qualification campaign. After controversially winning their play-off meeting with Ireland, the French players appeared aloof to the public as they headed straight for the dressing room instead of signing autographs. Several players were questioned by police just prior to the Finals in South Africa, following a raid on a Paris nightclub renowned for arranging dates between wealthy clients and underage prostitutes. Before the tournament began, the French Football Federation (FFF) announced that head coach Raymond Domenech would leave his position at the end of the tournament.\n\nStriker Nicolas Anelka delivered a profanity-laden criticism at Domenech as the team was losing to Mexico.\nAnelka was sent home after refusing to apologize. The next day, captain and left wingback Patrice Evra was caught on camera in a heated argument with trainer Robert Duverne, which eventually led to intervention by others in the camp. The players boycotted training for one day in protest at the FFF decision to dismiss Anelka. In turn, managing director Jean-Louis Valentin then resigned in disgust at the players' actions.\n\nOn the orders of President Nicolas Sarkozy, Sports Minister Roselyne Bachelot held an emotional meeting with the team where she admonished the players saying \"How would you like people to remember you? What image do you want to leave behind?\". This reportedly reduced the players, especially the younger ones, to tears and they applauded her. Later at an impromptu media briefing at the Free State Stadium, Bachelot said \"I told the players they had tarnished the image of France. It is a morale disaster for French football. I told them they could no longer be heroes for our children. They have destroyed the dreams of their countrymen, their friends and supporters.\" The players apologized to Domenech and resumed practice the next day. Patrice Evra was dropped for the final group game.\n\nFollowing the team's final defeat to hosts South Africa, Domenech refused to shake the hand of opposing coach Carlos Alberto Parreira. Domenech was strongly criticized in the French press, with sports daily \"L'Équipe\" accusing Domenech of \"arrogance and an attitude of contempt for others\".\n\nThe French team flew home in economy class. The fallout continued after the team's return to France, with FFF President Jean-Pierre Escalettes announcing his resignation. Escalettes has stated that Anelka would never be picked again for the national team. Former defender Lilian Thuram has said \"I asked for the players to be severely punished and for Patrice Evra never to come back into the France team. When you are captain of France, there is a responsibility and a respect for the shirt and for people that you have to have.\"\n\nThe entire World Cup squad was suspended for their next game against Norway by the FFF, upon request by the new manager Laurent Blanc. Five players were identified as having been key to the embarrassing events at the tournament; Nicolas Anelka, Patrice Evra, Franck Ribéry, Jérémy Toulalan and Éric Abidal were summoned to a hearing before the FFF discipliniary committee on 17 August 2010. After the expulsion of Anelka and ensuing training strike, Evra and Ribéry were summoned for failing in their duties as captain and vice captain, Toulalan was seen as the originator of the statement read out by coach Domenech to the media, while Abidal was accused of refusing to play in the final group match. After the hearing, Anelka was banned from playing for France for 18 games, Evra was banned for five, Ribéry for three, and Toulalan for one, while Abidal escaped punishment. Anelka dismissed the sanction as irrelevant, considering himself already retired from international football.\n\nThe final was particularly controversial due to the high number of yellow cards issued (fourteen, resulting in one sending-off). The most notable incident was Nigel de Jong's kick into the midriff of Alonso, punished only with a booking from referee Howard Webb, who subsequently admitted he should have shown a red card.\n\nBoth teams were fined by FIFA due to the ill-discipline of the match. Despite this, Spain was still awarded FIFA's Fair Play award for the tournament after the final, Spain had earned only 8 yellow cards throughout (the lowest of the four semi-finalists).\n\nDuring the Netherlands v Denmark group stage match, several women were removed from the stadium and later detained. It later emerged they were models for Bavaria beer. The tickets were sold to Bavaria by a friend of Robbie Earle, who was a pundit at the tournament for ITV Sport. ITV immediately cancelled Earle's contract with the network, citing that the tickets were only meant for his friends and family.\n\nThe official ball for the tournament, the Jabulani, was widely criticized by several players, although others came out in its defence.\n\nIn the aftermath of the tournament, Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan announced a 2-year ban on the men's national side due to its perceived poor performance. This move drew serious criticism and condemnation for all sides, and FIFA threatened sanctions in return for what it saw as \"political interference\".

Some were warned at the time of the original inquiry in 2006. Others were warned only after the Guardian revived the story in July 2009. Scotland Yard refuse to say how many were warned at either time. They have said that they also approached and warned people in four 'national security' categories if there was reasonable grounds to suspect that their voicemail might have been accessed without authority - members of the royal household, the military, the police and the government. But here again, they refuse to say how many people they warned in each of those categories.\n\nSecond, there are those who have taken the initiative to approach Scotland Yard and to ask whether the police hold any evidence that they were targeted in any way by Mulcaire. Scotland Yard are holding the results of an analysis of phone records which, we now know, revealed \"a vast number\" of people who had had their voicemail accessed; and also a spreadsheet which summarises the contents of the mass of paperwork, audio tapes and computer records which police seized from Mulcaire and which, the Guardian discovered, included 4,332 names or partial names; 2,987 mobile phone numbers; 30 audio tapes of varying length; and 91 PIN codes of a kind which are needed to access voicemail with the minority of targets who change the factory settings on their mobile phones.\n\nThird, there are 120 people who were identified by three mobile phone companies who followed up on Scotland Yard's original investigation and found that some of their users had had their voicemail accessed from numbers used by Glenn Mulcaire. Orange say they warned none of those whom they identified; Vodafone say they warned customers 'as appropriate'; O2 say they warned all of their customers whom they identified.\n\nSix unnamed journalists working for the Mail on Sunday/Daily Mail have been warned by the police that their name and/or other details are included in evidence held by the police.\n\nIn addition to the people already identified as victims, a number of people have approached the police to say that they believe their phone was hacked by the \"News of the World\".\n\n\n\n"}

Historically, the Gaelic word \"mòd\" (), which came from Old Norse \"mót\", refers to any kind of assembly. There are both local mòds, and an annual national mòd, the Royal National Mòd. Mòds are run under the auspices of An Comunn Gàidhealach. The term comes from a Gaelic word for a parliament or congress in common use during the Lordship of the Isles.\nA Mòd largely takes the form of formal competitions. Choral events (in Gaelic, both solo and choirs), and traditional music including fiddle, bagpipe and folk groups dominate. Spoken word events include children and adult's poetry reading, storytelling and Bible reading, and categories such as Ancient Folk Tale or Humorous Monologue. Children can also present an original drama, and there are competitions in written literature. Unlike the National Mòd, local mòds usually only last a day or two. They attract a much smaller crowd and the only notable social event is the winners' ceilidh. As there are fewer competitions than in the National Mòd, this ceilidh is often more like a traditional ceilidh with dancing and guest singers between the winners' performances. Culturally, mods are comparable to the Welsh eisteddfod, but without the ancient roots or the fanciful nineteenth-century \"druidic\" pageantry of the National Eisteddfod of Wales.\n\n\n\n"}

The story concerns a group of Royal Marines and convicts in a penal colony in New South Wales, in the 1780s, who put on a production of \"The Recruiting Officer\".\n\nIt was first staged at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 10 September 1988, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. It ran on Broadway in 1991.\n\nIn the 1780s, convicts and Royal Marines were sent to Australia as part of the first penal colony there. The play shows the class system in the convict camp and discusses themes such as sexuality, punishment, the Georgian judicial system, and the idea that it is possible for \"theatre to be a humanising force\".\n\nAs part of their research, Stafford-Clark and Wertenbaker went to see a play performed by convicts at Wormwood Scrubs, which proved inspiring: \"in prison conditions, theatre can be hugely heartening and influential and indeed in prison your options are so limited you can become a born-again Christian, a gym-queen constantly working out, a bird watcher or you become passionate about theatre.\" The convicts were, at least momentarily, civilized human beings, and they had taken their work very seriously: The convicts knew their lines absolutely because they had nothing else to do and they didn't want to waste time with pleasantries; as soon as you came into the room they started rehearsing. The two hours were very intense because the time was so valuable and we saw immediately how doing a play could become absolutely absorbing if you were incarcerated.\n\nMost of the characters in the play are based on real people who sailed with the First Fleet, though some have had their names changed. Wertenbaker was able to read the journals of First Fleet members in order to portray them accurately.\n\nIn the hold of the convict ship \"Sirius\", the convicts witness an (off-stage) flogging and express fear about their future. In Sydney Cove, an unnamed Aboriginal Australian witnesses the arrival of the first fleet. Throughout the play, he comments on the British settlement's effect on the indigenous populations, reacting with curiosity, confusion, and finally fear.\n\nSome time after arriving in Sydney, Governor Arthur Philip, Captain David Collins, Captain Watkin Tench, and Midshipman Harry Brewer debate the purpose of prison: should it be to punish or rehabilite?; and the nature of criminal tendencies: are they innate or acquired? When Tench mentions that the convicts consider hanging to be \"entertainment,\" Philip wonders if they could be offered something else. He suggests that the convicts could stage a play, but nevertheless orders Harry to find a hangman and execute three men who have been convicted of stealing food.\n\nAfter hanging two of the thieves, Harry is plagued by guilt, especially as one of the thieves, Handy Baker, was Harry's rival for the affection of Duckling Smith, a young convict woman. Harry tells Second Lieutenant Ralph Clark about the Governor's idea to have the convicts stage a play and Ralph decides to take this project on, hoping to get the Governor to notice him.\n\nRalph chooses George Farquhar's restoration comedy \"The Recruiting Officer\" and holds auditions. Some of the convicts who audition are Meg Long, an aged prostitute; Robert Sideway, a flamboyant pickpocket; the shy Mary Brenham; her more outspoken friend Dabby Bryant; and the hardened criminal Liz Morden. Ralph offers Mary the main female role of Silvia and reluctantly agrees that Dabby can play Rose. Liz Morden is offered the role of Melinda.\n\nOne evening, the officers discuss theatre, punishment, criminality and morality, and debate the value of Ralph's project. Major Ross, his acolyte Captain Campbell, and the pragmatic Captain Tench express conservative opinions and oppose the play, which is defended vehemently by Philip, Collins and Ralph Clark. Collins conducts a vote and with the majority in favour, Ralph is allowed to start rehearsals.\n\nDuckling complains that Harry is always watching her, leaving her no freedom. To appease her, he says that he will let her take part in the play. Dabby and Mary start learning their lines. Mary feels inadequate to play a noble lady, as she is ashamed of having sold herself to a sailor on the ship for food. Dabby argues that Mary was no virgin and that she might otherwise not have survived the voyage. Liz interrupts them and demands to be included, but Dabby becomes resentful when it becomes clear that Liz can't read. Their fight is broken up by James “Ketch” Freeman, the hangman. Freeman visits Ralph in his tent, claims that he is innocent of the murder that got him transported to Australia. He explains why he agreed to take on the office of hangman; having been convicted for stealing food, he was told “hang or be hanged”. He finally begs Ralph for a part in the play. A Jewish convict, John Wisehammer, engages Mary in a conversation about the meanings and sounds of words; she suggests he also take part in the play.\n\nAt the first rehearsal, two actors, Kable and Arscott, are missing; Sideway overacts, and Liz can't act at all. A convict named Black Caesar arrives and asks to play a servant. The rehearsal is interrupted by Ross and Campbell, who inform Ralph that Cable and Arscott have escaped. Ross arrests Caesar, who initially went with the escapees but came back. He also arrests Wisehammer, because Cable was last seen near Wisehammer’s hut; and Liz, accused of helping Cable steal food from the stores. The rehearsal is left in shambles.\n\nIn prison, Liz tells Wisehammer her life story. Wisehammer protests that he is innocent. Caesar dreams of making another escape attempt and returning to Madagascar. John Arscott, who has been recaptured, desperately cries out that escape is impossible. Sideway, Duckling and Mary arrive in prison so they can continue to rehearse.\n\nRalph tells Philip that, because half of his actors are in prison, he wants to stop the play, but Philip exhorts him to continue trying, making Ralph see the much larger meaning that the play has for the colony. Philip especially advocates for Liz Morden, as he wants to make an example of her – through redemption.\n\nIn his tent, Harry Brewer sees the ghosts of the two men he hanged, including his rival Handy Baker. He shouts for Duckling, but when she arrives, he cannot trust her, saying that the \"ghost\" told him that Handy and Duckling had been on the beach together.\n\nOn Philip’s orders, Ross brings Wisehammer, Caesar, and Liz to the second rehearsal. Nobody feels comfortable rehearsing in Ross's presence and Ralph tries to get him to leave. This just infuriates Ross. He starts humiliating the convicts, forcing Sideway to show his flogging scars, Dabby to imitate a dog and Mary to show the tattoo high up on her inner thigh. As the rehearsal continues, Sideway and Liz begin to enter more fully into their parts, boldly using the full length of the room and interacting with the others. The words of the play take a double meaning highly significant to the situation. In response, Ross orders Campbell to flog Arscott as punishment for his escape; the sounds of the flogging and Arscott's cries end the rehearsal.\n\nLiz has been sentenced to death for stealing food. Freeman reluctantly measures her for hanging. Harry, who oversees the process, still hears the ghosts of the dead. It becomes clear that Liz did not defend herself at her trial, but just as 'Ketch' and Harry are about to leave, she asks Harry to tell Ralph that she did not steal the food. As they question her as to why she didn't speak up, Harry collapses.\n\nAs Kable is not back, Ralph has taken over his part in \"The Recruiting Officer\". It is clear by now that Wisehammer and Ralph are rivals for Mary’s affection, just as they are for Silvia’s in the Farquhar play. Dabby complains that she can't relate to her character, but Wisehammer argues that a play should teach you something new. Arscott remarks that the play allows him to forget about own situation, contrasting with Dabby, who wants to play herself. The arrival of Ketch Freeman ends the rehearsal, as the others refuse to act with a hangman.\n\nIn Harry Brewer’s tent, Duckling promises love and fidelity to Harry, only to discover that he has just died. She collapses.\n\nMary is rehearsing on her own. Ralph joins her. Reciting their lines in the play, they end up confessing their love.\n\nPhilip, Ross, Collins, Campbell and Ralph discuss Liz Morden one more time. Philip is afraid of a miscarriage of justice, as the evidence against her is flimsy. Liz is given a last chance to defend herself. She finally speaks, saying that she knew Cable wanted to steal the food, but she wasn’t present when he did. Collins orders a retrial. Despite her situation, Liz surprises everyone present by politely promising to perform her role in the play.\n\nBackstage before the performance, the actors attempt to console Duckling. They also discuss the future: Dabby plans to escape that night; Sideway wants to start a theatre company; Liz and Freeman want to join Sideway's company as actors and Wisehammer as playwright; Mary and Ralph plan their lives together. Caesar is very drunk and suffering from stage fright; only ludicrous threats from his fellow actors convince him to go on stage. Wisehammer reminds Ralph of the prologue he wrote for the play and reads it. Although pleased, Ralph does not dare to use it, because it is too political. The play begins: Arscott and Caesar go onstage while as the rest of the cast listens in trepidation. The first speech of the play is met with tremendous applause.\n\nThe play has been written with the idea of doubling in mind, needing only ten actors for twenty-two roles. It is typically performed with performers changing costumes on stage; a wig and military uniform jacket marking the only differences between an officer and a convict. Ralph Clark is the only character that has to be played by an actor without a second role; every other actor plays at least one convict and one officer, with three actors even taking three roles. The following table shows the list of characters with all roles typically (as done by the original production and imitated by most later productions) taken by one actor in the same horizontal line\n\n\nIn England, the play is used by the exam board AQA and Edexcel as a set text for Advanced Level Theatre Studies and as a set text to use in comparison essays for GCE. It has also been used in universities' performing arts and English departments. It has been performed across Europe as part of GCE candidates' final performances. It is also used at AS level in English Literature studies, as well as a set text in the OIB administered by CIE and is also commonly used in English speaking English Literature classes for the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme.\n\nThe play's first production was at the Royal Court Theatre, London, on 10 September 1988, directed by Max Stafford-Clark. The production starred David Haig as Ralph Clark, Jim Broadbent as Harry Brewer, John Arscott and Captain Campbell, Linda Bassett as Lieutenant Will Dawes and Liz Morden, and Ron Cook as Captain Arthur Phillip and John Wisehammer.\n\n\"Our Country's Good\" premiered on Broadway at the Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1991 and closed on June 8, 1991 after 12 previews and 48 performances. Directed by Mark Lamos, the cast featured Cherry Jones (Liz Morden and Reverend Johnson), Peter Frechette (2nd Lieutenant Ralph Clark), Tracey Ellis (Mary Brennan and Lieutenant George Johnston), Amelia Campbell (Lieutenant Will Dawes, Duckling Smith and Meg Long) and J. Smith-Cameron (Dabby Bryant and 2nd Lieutenant William Faddy).\n\nThe play was performed at the Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum Theatre, directed by Caroline Hall and featuring Louise Gold as Lieutenant Will Dawes and Liz Morden. It was also presented at the Liverpool Playhouse in 2007. Among the cast members was Charlie Brooks. The actors also provided a workshop for real life convicts in Walton Prison.\n\nIn 2012 Max Stafford-Clark, the play's original director, directed a new production for Out of Joint and the Octagon Theatre, Bolton which played at the St. James Theatre.\n\nIn 2015, Voice Theatre staged a production of the play at the Byrdcliffe Theater in Woodstock, New York. Shauna Kanter directed, and Jon Lee starred.\n\nIn 2018, Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts staged a production of the play at the Bridewell Theatre in London. Steven Grihault directed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

The lectures present scientific subjects to a general audience, including young people, in an informative and entertaining manner. Michael Faraday initiated the first Christmas Lecture series in 1825. This came at a time when organised education for young people was scarce. Faraday presented a total of nineteen series in all.\n\nThe Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures were first held in 1825, and have continued on an annual basis since then except during the Second World War. They have been hosted each year at the Royal Institution itself, except in 1929 and between 2005–2006, each time due to refurbishment of the building. They were created by Michael Faraday, who later hosted the lecture season on nineteen occasions. Other notable lecturers have included Desmond Morris (1964), Sir David Attenborough (1973), Heinz Wolff (1975), Carl Sagan (1977), George Porter (1985), Richard Dawkins (1991), Baroness Susan Greenfield (1994), Dame Nancy Rothwell (1998), Monica Grady (2003), Sue Hartley (2009), Alison Woollard (2013), Danielle George (2014), and Saiful Islam (2016).\n\nThe props for the lectures are designed and created by the RI's science demonstration technician, a post which Faraday previously held. The technician is informed of the general subject of the lectures during spring, but the specifics aren't settled until September, with the recordings made in mid-December. By 2009, the lectures had expanded to a series of five sessions each year. However, in 2010 the Royal Institution cut back on costs as it had become over £2 million in debt. These cost cutting measures included the budget allotted to the Christmas Lectures. This resulted in a reduction from five sessions to three.\n\nThe Christmas Lectures were first televised in 1936 on the BBC's fledgling Television Service. They were broadcast on BBC Two from 1966–1999 and Channel 4 from 2000–2004. In 2000 one of the lectures was broadcast live for the first time. Following the end of Channel 4's contract to broadcast the lectures, there were concerns that they might simply be dropped from scheduling as the channel was negotiating with the Royal Institution over potential changes to the format, while the BBC announced that \"The BBC will not show the lectures again, because it feels the broadcasting environment has moved on in the last four years.\" Channel Five subsequently agreed to show the lectures from 2005–2008, an announcement which was met with derision from academics. The lectures were broadcast on More4 in 2009. In 2010, the lectures returned to the BBC after a ten-year absence from the broadcaster, and have been shown on BBC Four each year since then.\n\nThe following is a complete list of the Christmas Lectures from 1825 to 1965:\nThe following is a list of televised Christmas Lectures from 1966 onward :\n"}

The format was first pioneered at the Puerto Rico Salsa Congress in 1997.\n\nSince then salsa congresses have become popular in almost every country, including different cities in the USA, all over Europe, parts of Asia, and countries in Latin America and Africa. There are many events that follow a similar format to salsa congresses, but go by other names such as \"Salsa Festival\" or \"Salsa Summit\".\n\nThe first salsa congress in the world took place in Puerto Rico in 1997 promoted by Eli Irizarry. The number of people participating in this first edition was 375 coming from 19 different countries.\n\nIn 1998 the number of participants was 550 from 23 countries, with 32 salsa companies performing and teaching and by 1999 there were 800 people from 34 countries with about 56 salsa companies taking part. In 2008 the finals of the World Salsa Open were hosted at the Puerto Rico Congress which concluded with Spain (Anita Santos and Adrián Rodríguez) winning the first position, Puerto Rico (Licelott Maldonado and Kelvin Hernández) as runner-up and Argentina (Fernando Alonso and Ayelen Gauna) in third place.\n\nThe All Stars Entertainment company and Bacardí promoted between 1999 and 2002 a salsa tour, called the \"Congreso Mundial de la salsa\" in several locations including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Curaçao, Denver, Tokyo, Bombay, Calcutta, Valencia, Roma, Torino, Milan, Santiago de Compostela, Berlin, Frankfurt, Munich, London, Amsterdam, Miami, Mexico, Panamá, Colombia, Venezuela, Guayaquil, Osaka, Buenos Aires, Sydney, Paris or San Juan de Puerto Rico.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000 one of the cities visited by the 'Congreso Mundial de la salsa' was Los Angeles which has resulted in a congress every year since. The event is held every May and is the oldest salsa congress in the US. The congress was originally called the \"West Coast Salsa Congress\", but was later changed to the \"LA Salsa Congress\" as more cities on the West Coast began hosting congresses. In 2013 the event was renamed the \"LA Salsa Fest\".\n\nBy 2013 Salsa congresses and festivals had become an annual tradition in nearly half the major European cities, including London (UK), Berlin (Germany), Warsaw (Poland), Vilnius (Lithuania), Budapest (Hungary), Brasov (Romania), Split (Croatia), Milan (Italy), Riga (Latvia), Munich (Germany), Maribor (Slovenia), Edinburgh (Scotland) and many others.\n\nMany of the most successful and relevant salsa congresses in Europe were started in 2002, such as the UK International Salsa Congress in London, Simposium de la salsa (Madrid), Rome, Hamburg and the Switzerland Salsa Congress at Zurich. One of the first salsa congresses in Germany was 2003 in Regensburg. Report Regensburg Salsa Congress 2003\n\nThe Croatian Summer Salsa Festival (CSSF) in Rovinj Croatia was founded in 2005, as well as the Tallinn Salsafestival (TSF) in Estonia.\nThe Vilnius Salsa Festival (VSF) that takes place annually in Lithuania was started in 2007.\n\nThere are many other congresses in Europe now available to enjoy, each with its own unique flavour; in the UK for instance is the Teesside Latin Festival (started in 2009) in the north east of England, which is one of the most popular and fastest growing in UK. The congress combines LA salsa, NY Salsa and Cuban Salsa in one festival. It also includes a Kizomba Festival.\n\nWhen making a choice of congresses salseros first need to determine what they 'like' or prefer and their budgets. Some congresses cater more towards one style, such as Bachata, Cuban Salsa, LA/NY Salsa and NY on2, others give a taste of all styles and encourage salseros to experience different forms of dancing. As a general rule for beginners, improvers and intermediate dancers an 'all style' congress is the most suitable. More advanced dancers who specialise in a specific style of dancing may want to go to a more focused congress. Some combine a holiday with a congress, staying for a few extra days for sightseeing or to go to the beach.\n"}

It was first produced as an opera by Sea of Blood Theatrical Troupe (\"Pibada Guekdan\") in 1971. It was then later adapted into a novel by the Choseon Novelist Association of the 4.15 Culture Creation Group () in 1973.\n\n\"Sea of Blood\" is set in the 1930s, during the Japanese occupation of Korea, and follows the life of protagonist Sun-Nyo and her family as they suffer numerous tragedies at the hands of the Japanese before eventually gaining the willpower and means to join the communist revolution and fight against their oppressors. The story is meant to exemplify the values of the \"Juche\" ideology, with self-reliance and solidarity being the central themes. The novel is notable for its highly detailed descriptions and lengthy narrations of each character's point of view as well as its graphic depiction of violence. It is also mandatory reading in North Korea’s literature curriculum.\n\nAlong with \"The Flower Girl\" (), \"Tell O’the Forest!\" (), \"A True Daughter of the Party\" () and \"The Song of Mount Kumgang\" (), \"Sea of Blood\" is considered one of the \"Five Great Revolutionary Operas\" (Korean revolutionary opera) (), which are the five most critically acclaimed operas within North Korea with revolutionary themes. The opera is considered as a masterpiece in North Korea since it expresses the unique aspects of the \"Juche\" regime's revolutionary ideology. It is also regarded as an exemplary revolutionary piece because of its unique use of visual and auditory effect and unprecedented theme, which was unlike other existing operas.\n\nThe opera is known for being North Korea's longest-running production, having been staged over 1,500 times, and is presented three to four times a week at Pyongyang's main theater. The North Korean Opera Troupe, which was established in 1946, was renamed \"Sea of Blood Opera Troupe\" shortly after the opera's release in 1971.\n\n\"Sea of Blood\" was also produced as a four-hour black-and-white film, Kim Jong-il produced the film, directed by Choe Ik-gyu.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23499848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23499848", "title": "Secondary source", "text": "Secondary source\n\nIn scholarship, a secondary source is a document or recording that relates or discusses information originally presented elsewhere. A secondary source contrasts with a primary source, which is an original source of the information being discussed; a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document created by such a person. \n\nA secondary source is one that gives information about a primary source. In this source, the original information is selected, modified and arranged in a suitable format. Secondary sources involve generalization, analysis, interpretation, or evaluation of the original information. \nThe most accurate classification for any given source is not always obvious. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" are relative terms, and some sources may be classified as primary or secondary, depending on how they are used. A third level, the tertiary source, such as an encyclopedia or dictionary, resembles a secondary source in that it contains analysis, but attempts to provide a broad introductory overview of a topic.\n\nInformation can be taken from a wide variety of objects, but this classification system is only useful for a class of sources that are called symbolic sources. Symbolic sources are sources that are intended to communicate information to someone. Common symbolic sources include written documents such as letters and notes, but not, for example, bits of broken pottery and scraps of food excavated from a midden, regardless of how much information can be extracted from an ancient trash heap, or how little can be extracted from a written document. \n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are used. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. For example, if a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion, but a secondary source of information found in the old documents. Other examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source, but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\".\n\nAttempts to map or model scientific and scholarly communication need the concepts of primary, secondary and further \"levels\". One such model is the UNISIST model of information dissemination. Within such a model these concepts are defined in relation to each other, and the acceptance of this way of defining the concepts are connected to the acceptance of the model.\n\nSome other modern languages use more than one word for the English word \"source\". German usually uses \"Sekundärliteratur\" (\"secondary literature\") for secondary sources for historical facts, leaving \"Sekundärquelle\" (\"secondary source\") to historiography. A \"Sekundärquelle\" is a source which can tell about a lost \"Primärquelle\" (\"primary source\"), such as a letter quoting from minutes which are no longer known to exist, and so cannot be consulted by the historian.\n\nIn general, secondary sources are self-described as review articles or meta-analysis.\n\nPrimary source materials are typically defined as \"original research papers written by the scientists who actually conducted the study.\" An example of primary source material is the Purpose, Methods, Results, Conclusions sections of a research paper (in IMRAD style) in a scientific journal by the authors who conducted the study. In some fields, a secondary source may include a summary of the literature in the Introduction of a scientific paper, a description of what is known about a disease or treatment in a chapter in a reference book, or a synthesis written to review available literature. A survey of previous work in the field in a primary peer-reviewed source is secondary source information. This allows secondary sourcing of recent findings in areas where full review articles have not yet been published.\n\nA book review that contains the judgment of the reviewer about the book is a primary source for the reviewer's opinion, and a secondary source for the contents of the book. A summary of the book within a review is a secondary source.\n\nIn library and information sciences, secondary sources are generally regarded as those sources that summarize or add commentary to primary sources in the context of the particular information or idea under study.\n\nAn important use of secondary sources in the field of mathematics has been to make difficult mathematical ideas and proofs from primary sources more accessible to the public; in other sciences tertiary sources are expected to fulfill the introductory role.\n\nSecondary sources in history and humanities are usually books or scholarly journals, from the perspective of a later interpreter, especially by a later scholar. In the humanities, a peer reviewed article is always a secondary source.\nThe delineation of sources as primary and secondary first arose in the field of historiography, as historians attempted to identify and classify the sources of historical writing. In scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. In original scholarly writing, historians rely on primary sources, read in the context of the scholarly interpretations.\n\nFollowing the Rankean model established by German scholarship in the 19th century, historians use archives of primary sources. Most undergraduate research projects rely on secondary source material, with perhaps snippets of primary sources.\n\nIn the legal field, source classification is important because the persuasiveness of a source usually depends upon its history. Primary sources may include cases, constitutions, statutes, administrative regulations, and other sources of binding legal authority, while secondary legal sources may include books, the headnotes of case reports, articles, and encyclopedias. Legal writers usually prefer to cite primary sources because only primary sources are authoritative and precedential, while secondary sources are only persuasive at best.\n\n\"A secondary source is a record or statement of an event or circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the event or circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the event, or by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor.\" Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event \"when the fallibility of memory is an important factor\" is a secondary source, even though it may be the first published description of that event.\n\nAn autobiography can be a secondary source in history or the humanities when used for information about topics other than its subject. For example, many first hand accounts of events in World War I written in the post-war years were influenced by the then prevailing perception of the war which was significantly different from contemporary opinion.\n\n\n"}

Mostly situated to the south of Central Park, the show is normally held on the first weekend in October, and includes more than 700 artisans from various locations throughout the Americas. The show draws nearly 300,000 people, one-third from out of state, each year. The show is put together by a group of various neighborhood associations in Old Louisville.\n\nThe art and item selection at the show runs from the mundane to the sublime, and the inexpensive to the very expensive. Booths featuring such items as furniture, pottery, jewelry, glassworks, photography and paintings are lined up on streets and sidewalks with ample walk spaces between them to handle large crowds. Booths with the highest showcase quality are situated on St. James Court, Belgravia Court and Magnolia Avenue, while booths on Fourth and Third Streets tend to purvey more consumer-oriented artistic items. The 19th century mansion Conrad-Caldwell House, on St. James Court, is open for tours during the show.\n\nIn addition to the various items for sale, the show attracts various state and local politicians, charities, churches, radio stations and publishers who take the opportunity to promote themselves to the public.\n\nThe event is sponsored by various corporate donors. There are various awards given out for \"Best of Show,\" \"People's Choice,\" the poster contest and several scholarships. The show has been ranked #1 in the nation by Sunshine Artist Magazine.\n\nBeing held in the neighborhood Old Louisville has a particular significance because the St James Art show was founded in order to produce revenue and sustain the surrounding area. Old Louisville at the time the St James Art Show was created was in a financial decline; however, today it is known as one of the most popular areas of Louisville. Old Louisville became a historic district in 1975, and also has the United States largest collection of Victorian style homes. This unique atmosphere creates the perfect location for the St James Art Show, as the art show is almost exclusively outdoors, and people enjoy walking around the neighborhood.\n\n\n"}

It was the brainchild of the noted harpsichord builder/entrepreneur Wolfgang Zuckermann.\n\nZuckermann's successful career as a seller of build-it-yourself harpsichord kits had been facilitated by a surge of public interest in music of the Baroque and classical periods. The festival was founded in 1963 by Zuckermann together with his colleague Eric Britton in response to this surge, as well as to rising interest in chamber music and related art forms.\n\nThe two built a charming open-air amphitheater, seating 250 people. The amphitheater was originally designed by Zuckermann himself and redesigned and built in partnership with local contractors. It was located on a 55 acre estate in the rural town of Upper Black Eddy, Northern Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a bit more than one hour from New York City (where Zuckermann ran his business in Greenwich Village) and rather less from Philadelphia. The rural surroundings added to the appeal of the enterprise, as Michael Townsend Smith (who succeeded Britton as director in 1966) later wrote:\nIt was extremely charming, and we presented a wondrous range of artists over the next three summers. Farther up the drive beyond the theatre, there were two houses, a barn, a tennis court, a big concrete swimming down in the woods, and a screened-in summer house. ... The performers often came for the weekend and enjoyed the facilities.\nZuckermann served as Managing Director, Eric Britton as Associate Director (1963-1965, followed by Smith). The festival featured chamber music, other musical artists (including, not surprisingly, various eminent harpsichordists), and some off-the-beaten path offering such as marionette opera.\n\nThe festival took place in the months of July and August. There were two performances weekly, Friday and Saturday nights, solely dedicated to chamber music, modern dance, drama, poetry readings, and film. Admission was $2.00 per concert.\n\nThe chamber music events were entirely devoted to classical music and featured some of the most appreciated groups of the time (Galimir String Quartet, the Kroll Quartet, the Claremont Quartet, Krainis Baroque Trio), harpsichordists (including Fernando Valenti, Sylvia Marlowe, Pamela Cook, Robert Conant), and distinguished musicians and singers (Helen Boatwright, Sanford Allen, Peter Serkin, Michael Tree, Rey de la Torre, Daniel Weisman, Suzanne Bloch among them).\n\nAn edge to the festival was given by less familiar, at times more experiment works, such as the dance presentations of the James Waring Company, Merce Cunningham (and John Cage), and Yvonne Rainer, among them. Sundance also presented off-off Broadway plays, marionette operas, poetry readings Allen Ginsburg and low budget films of what was then called the Independent American Cinema.\n\nThe last performances at Sundance took place in Summer 1968. In 1969, Zuckermann moved to England, selling both his harpsichord business as well as the Sundance property, and the Sundance Festival came to an end.\n\nOne enthusiastic patron wrote at the time: \"Sundance is the newest and brightest star in the Bucks County firmament. The setting is a charming sylvan one, deep in a wooded area. The comfortable seating is, in true theater fashion so that one has an obstructed view from every point. The stage is handsome having a proscenium on which the names of the geniuses of the past and present are carved in gold on a dark brown with background. But the most interesting aspect before one enters the open air seating area and views the stage is that of the Mexican Indian like stucco wall, which forms the background of the theater, and seems to convey the idea of an abstract painting. And there is peace and beauty here – and excitement.\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor additional information:\n\nFrom Michael Townsend Smith:\nFrom Eric Britton, Paris:\n"}

It is usually observed on the first Sunday in February and is sometimes referred to as an unofficial national holiday. The 52nd annual event, Super Bowl LII, occurred on February 4, 2018. Festivities for Super Sunday typically involve groups of people gathering to watch the game. Both \"Super Sunday\" and \"Super Bowl Sunday\" are registered trademarks of the National Football League.\n\nAlthough not an official holiday, Super Sunday is an occasion when many families and friends gather together to watch the game, including those who are not normally football fans. Although sports bars have historically been busy on Super Sunday in the past, it is becoming more common for people to watch the game from home. This is due in part to the increasing size of home televisions in the United States as well as the attempts of budget conscious consumers to save money.\n\nBecause watching the Super Bowl is so popular, stores are often empty during the game, particularly in the regions represented by the two teams playing in the Super Bowl, and water usage drops, with significant rises in use during halftime and after the game, as fans use the bathroom. Additionally, churches sometimes cancel afternoon or evening services on Super Sunday, hold football-themed charity drives, or deliver sermons designed to appeal to male members of the congregation.\n\nNFL executives have called for a three-day weekend in order to allow fans to celebrate the event, and there is thought to be a loss of productivity in the American work force on Monday after the event. The television network carrying the game (either CBS, Fox, or NBC) will usually devote the entire day's programming schedule to the game, with extended pregame shows, NFL Films retrospectives of the previous season, and special versions of the Sunday morning talk shows in the morning and afternoon hours leading into the game. Competing networks, due to the severe loss of viewers to the Super Bowl festivities, generally resort to low-cost counterprogramming measures like the \"Puppy Bowl.\"\n\nLarge amounts of food and alcohol are consumed on Super Sunday. The event is the second-largest food consumption event in the United States, behind only Thanksgiving dinner, and some police departments have noticed a dramatic increase in drunk driving on Super Sunday.\n\nSuper Sunday food is usually served buffet style, rather than as a sit-down meal. Foods traditionally eaten on Super Sunday include buffalo wings, chili, baby back ribs, dipping sauces, pizza, and potato chips. Many pizza delivery businesses see their order numbers double as roughly 60 percent of the take out ordered on Super Sunday is pizza. Roughly of chips, 1.25 billion chicken wings, and of guacamole are consumed during Super Sunday.\n"}

{"id": "54229789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54229789", "title": "The Case for Impeachment", "text": "The Case for Impeachment\n\nThe Case for Impeachment is a non-fiction book by American University Distinguished Professor of History Allan Lichtman arguing for the impeachment of Donald Trump. It was published on April 18, 2017 by Dey Street Books, an imprint of HarperCollins. Lichtman predicted to \"The Washington Post\" that after ascending to the presidency, Trump would later be impeached from office. He developed this thesis into a set of multiple arguments for Trump's predicted impeachment.\n\nLichtman argues in the book that Trump could face impeachment for reasons including: complicity of conspiracy with foreign governments, crimes against humanity for the U.S. neglecting global warming, and violation of the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. He provides the reader with an overview of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, asserting such ties could be used in efforts to impeach President Trump. He uses the Watergate scandal as the backdrop to compare Trump's reactions to criticism with those of Richard Nixon during Nixon's impeachment process. The author discusses assertions of sexual misconduct against Trump, and delves into some of the his legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recordings within a larger context of public degradation of women.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" gave \"The Case for Impeachment\" a positive review, writing: \"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations.\" \"The Washington Post\" called it \"striking to see the full argument unfold\". \"New York Journal of Books\" recommended it as a resource, \"if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought\". \"CounterPunch\" characterized the work as \"a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act\". \"The Hill\" gave the author praise, writing: \"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\" CBC News consulted law scholars who said Lichtman's impeachment prediction was unlikely, especially with a Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives.\n\n\"The Case for Impeachment\" sets forth multiple arguments why President Trump's actions warrant impeachment from office. The author organizes the book into subsets of different grounds for impeachment. These include complicity or conspiracy with foreign governments. Lichtman explains to the reader the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the constitution, barring the president from taking personal monetary offerings from other governments. The author contends impeachment could be brought for actions by the president intended to benefit himself financially based on inside information about economic dealings. Lichtman observes the president has not garnered knowledge from a study of earlier key events in U.S. politics: \"A president who seems to have learned nothing from history is abusing and violating the public trust and setting the stage for a myriad of impeachable offenses.\"\n\nLichtman compares and contrasts Trump's actions with the Impeachment of Richard Nixon stemming from the Watergate scandal. Discussion of prior impeachment proceedings for presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton are placed within historical context, and the book makes comparisons between Trump and Richard Nixon. The author writes that Trump's decisions threaten American values: \"Even early in his presidency, Donald Trump exhibits the same tendencies that led Nixon to violate the most basic standards of morality and threaten the foundations of our democracy.\" Lichtman argues that Trump's failure to learn from Nixon's negative example will harm his presidency, noting: \"They also shared a compulsion to deflect blame, and they were riddled with insecurities.\" He criticizes what he documents as Trump's disregard for veracity: \"Neither man allowed the law, the truth, the free press, or the potential for collateral damage to others to impede their personal agendas.\" Lichtman feels Trump and Nixon's potential political success can be viewed as stifled by a perceived need for covert decision making devoid of critical viewpoints: \"They obsessed over secrecy and thirsted for control without dissent.\"\n\nThe author provides an overview of actions taken by Trump before his presidency that could also lead to his downfall, including possible violations of the Fair Housing Act, the operations of Trump University, and donations or lack thereof related to the Donald J. Trump Foundation. With regard to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, the author outlines for the reader the basis for impeachment with discussion of Trump and Trump family debt, trademark negotiations with China, and financial transactions in the Philippines, arguing these obligations could allow foreign powers control over the Trump Administration. In a proposal that the author acknowledges is unlikely, he submits the International Criminal Court could potentially prosecute the president for crimes against humanity related to reneging on agreements to combat climate change. Legally this would not have significant standing on its own for impeachment in the U.S. however, the author suggests that it could provide the moral impetus for legislators to take further actions instead.\n\n\"The Case for Impeachment\" devotes a chapter to assertions of sexual misconduct made by women against Trump, and details some of Trump's legal affairs stemming from them. Lichtman describes Trump as driven by lust, and places the Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording within a larger context of public degradation of women. Events contained in the discussion of this topic are later contrasted with the fact that despite such details, Trump garnered a majority of white female voters' support compared to his opponent Hillary Clinton.\n\nLichtman takes the reader through Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and writes that President Trump: \"stands a chance of becoming the first American president charged with treason or the failure to report treason by agents and associates\". He likens the multiple investigations by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the House Intelligence Committee, and the Senate Intelligence Committee into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, and Trump associates' links a \"Sword of Damocles\" awaiting Trump. The author concludes these investigations could have disastrous impact for the president: \"Neither Republicans nor Democrats in Congress will tolerate a compromised or treacherous president. Impeachment and trial will be quick and decisive.\"\n\nIn September 2016, Lichtman used a forecast model he had developed earlier to predict that Donald Trump would win the US presidential election. Lichtman had published the book \"The Keys to the White House\" in 1996 about a system he created, inspired by earthquake research, to predict the outcome of US presidential elections. His model accurately forecast the popular vote winner of all the US presidential elections from 1984 to 2012. Lichtman shared his 2016 election prediction in September in interviews with \"The Washington Post\" and \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC. After his 2016 election prediction was borne out, President-elect Trump sent Lichtman a letter of thanks, writing: \"Professor – Congrats – good call.\"\n\nOn November 11, 2016, three days after Trump won the 2016 US presidential election, Lichtman reiterated to \"The Washington Post\" another prediction he had made in September 2016 – that Trump would be impeached as president. He predicted this reasoning that a Republican controlled US Congress would rather have a more stable Mike Pence elevated from Vice President of the United States to the presidency. He explained to \"The Washington Post\": \"They don't want Trump as president, because they can't control him. He's unpredictable. They'd love to have Pence – an absolutely down-the-line, conservative, controllable Republican.\" Lichtman elaborated on the likelihood of his impeachment assessment: \"I'm quite certain Trump will give someone grounds for impeachment, either by doing something that endangers national security or because it helps his pocketbook.\"\n\nLichtman was engaged in writing the book in February 2017. His representative from HarperCollins publishers told \"Time\" magazine that Lichtman's thesis focused on: \"not a question of \"if\" President Trump will be impeached, but a question of \"when\"\". During the writing process, Lichtman focused his efforts on outlining a thesis explaining why Trump was vulnerable to being removed from office, due to concerns about links between Trump associates and Russian officials, and possible conflicts of interest tied to his global financial dealings. Whereas his September 2016 prediction of a Trump win in the US presidential election was based on a tested prediction model, his basis for the impeachment thesis was more of a qualitative analysis. Lichtman explained to Steve Scully of C-SPAN his reason for writing the book, \"I wrote it as a deep historical analysis for the history of the impeachment process prior to the presidency. I wrote it so people could arm themselves with the knowledge of when Trump might have crossed the line to begin impeachment.\"\n\nIn an interview with \"GQ\" magazine, Lichtman explained his thought process for predicting a Trump impeachment: \"it is based on a deep study of history, including Trump's parallels to his impeached predecessors; a study of the process of impeachment; a study of Trump's vulnerabilities\". He explained why he chose to write the book at this particular point, emphasizing it was to provide a guide for the public, and \"because impeachment is a political process that occurs outside of the courts. It is responsive to the people, and if impeachment is going to take place, it will be because the American people demand it.\" Lichtman said because there were many potential unlawful activities, \"I believe he is more vulnerable than any early president in the history of the nation.\"\n\nPrior to finishing the book, Lichtman had a contract with Dey Street Books to publish it in the US with a publication date of April 18, 2017. On March 3, 2017, the publisher William Collins bought the rights to publish and sell the book in the UK and Commonwealth excluding Canada also for release in April. The contract was reported as being a \"significant deal\". \"The Case for Impeachment\" was first published in hardcover format on April 18, 2017, in the US. It was also released in e-book and audiobook formats. The UK Commonwealth edition was published in London. Within the first seven weeks after the book was first published, 10,000 copies were purchased for sale.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" journalist Carlos Lozada wrote in a review that on reading the book, it was \"striking to see the full argument unfold and realize that you don't have to be a zealot to imagine some version of it happening\". He concluded: \"Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. It may be too late.\" Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the \"London Evening Standard\" writing: \"His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more.\" \"New York Journal of Books\" contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: \"\"The Case for Impeachment\" is a good backdrop for conversations that will likely remain a part of our national dialogue for some time – or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all that this administration has wrought.\" \"AM Joy\" host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a \"fascinating book,\" particularly because Lichtman had been one of the only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election. Joe Scarborough on \"Morning Joe\" called the book \"liberal catnip\".\n\nWriting for the \"Financial Times\", Edward Luce gave the book a positive review, concluding: \"Lichtman's powerful book is a reminder that we are only at the start of the Trump investigations. The US system takes a long time to gather speed. Once it does, it can be hard to stop.\" In a review for \"CounterPunch\", Charles R. Larson wrote: \"What is so compelling about \"The Case for Impeachment\" is the plethora of acts by Donald Trump that in a sane world would have brought him down long before he even ran for president.\" Larson recommended the book to potential readers: \"you need to read \"The Case for Impeachment\", a brilliant analysis of every fraudulent act committed by the child in the White House\". Brent Budowsky reviewed the book for \"The Hill\" and praised it, writing: \"Lichtman has written what may be the most important book of the year.\" He agreed with the premise that the book should start a wider debate in the public: \"I am suggesting that Professor Lichtman is right: America should now begin a serious debate about how far is too for the leader of the land of the free and the home of the brave.\"\n\nCBC News interviewed academics including constitutional law expert and resource for the U.S. House Judiciary Committee in the impeachment of Bill Clinton, Susan Low Bloch, who were skeptical of some of the book's arguments. Bloch opined that impeachment was not as easy as was thought: \"You are undoing a national election, and I can't think of anything more serious politically than undoing an election. Whether you like Trump or not, he's now the president until he's done something impeachable – which he hasn't, so far as we know.\"\n\nLichtman was interviewed about his book after President Trump fired FBI director James Comey. He told \"Newsweek\" this added to the evidence that Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, and compared it to the Watergate scandal. He reminded \"The National\" that support for impeachment grew after Nixon fired his special prosecutor. Lichtman remarked to \"Salon\" that Comey's firing and circumstantial evidence of 2016 election coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia were reasons for impeachment. He explained public opinion in 1974 changed the viewpoints of Nixon's Republican comrades towards impeachment. Lichtman elaborated that impeachment was possible even with a Republican-controlled Congress. He pointed out impeachment grew likely if Republicans felt Trump hurt their election chances. Lichtman emphasized to \"AM Joy\", the first adage of politicians was to safeguard their careers. He commented to \"Mic\" and \"Newsweek\" the chance of impeachment grew after Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony about his memos, and said the evidence was stronger than that in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Writing in \"The Hill\" Lichtman said that Paul Ryan's assertions that some of the president's actions could be excused because of ignorance or naivety were indefensible, and would not stand.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2179403", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2179403", "title": "Undie 500", "text": "Undie 500\n\nThe Undie 500, originally named the Under 500, was an annual student-run car rally between Christchurch and Dunedin, New Zealand with multiple stops at drinking establishments along the way. The name comes from the original rule that a vehicle is purchased for less than NZ$500, and optionally decorated.\n\nThe event has run since the early 1980s and is organised by the University of Canterbury Engineering Society Inc. (ENSOC). The premise of the event is for student members of ENSOC to purchase and decorate a vehicle before rallying the cars to Dunedin. The vehicles are individually themed and occupants pub crawl over the entire day of driving. This event is characterised by the high level of work performed on the entrants' cars; transforming them from normal motor vehicles into something unique.\n\nThe event was originally to coincide with the weekend of the annual Canterbury University Engineers v Otago Surveyors rugby match. At this time and well into the 1990s it was known as the \"Under 500\". Somewhere along the way it has been transformed into the \"Undie 500\", presumably to establish a similar-sounding name to the more famous Indy 500.\n\nSince 2003, the number of vehicles was limited to 150. The event used to attract more than 1,000 participants and thousands of spectators. The event was widely reported, attracting national TV news coverage, newspaper, radio and has even featured in \"Ralph\" magazine. The New Zealand Police accompany the convoy throughout the trip to ensure both the safety of participants and other road users.\n\nSince 2006, when others driving cars not associated with the event began traveling to Dunedin concurrently and rioting, the event has also received much negative publicity due to rioting students and others associated with the event. Some have been charged with offenses including offensive language and breaching the liquor ban the Dunedin City Council had placed.\n\nAfter the 2009 event, the head of the University of Canterbury Students' Association (UCSA) noted that they could not \"exert authority on those hangers-on or those other students and young people that head to Dunedin to use this as an excuse for violence or anti-social behaviour.\", and that it was no longer in the interest of students to be associated with those who were causing trouble after the event. Consequently, the 2009 head of the UCSA predicted ENSOC could not run a further event to Dunedin in light of the trouble that would be caused by those non-students who would use it as an excuse for violence and other anti-social behaviour, but appeared not to rule out a similar event heading to a different destination.\n\nMany in Dunedin see the event as having been sensationalised by the media, with one local noting the \"local newspaper will start printing stories a week in advance, and will continue for a week after the event, even if it runs smoothly.\"\n\nCars were expected to meet the following requirements:\n\nIn previous years it was also a requirement to have a vehicle under the price of $500, hence the name UNDIE 500. However, due to rising prices and stricter regulations this rule was later overlooked.\n\nBefore embarking for Dunedin, cash prizes were awarded for outstanding entries including:\n\nThe winner of best dressed vehicle in 1994 was a 1964 HD Holden Special station wagon cleverly transformed into Thomas The Tank Engine. It featured in an article on the Under 500 in The Timaru Herald newspaper. That year there was a bad snow storm on The Kilmog hill, just north of Dunedin. The local police stopped many of the cars on their way up the hill due to the icy conditions. This vehicle was allowed through as it was explained to the officer, \"This is a train, not a car\".\n\nThe 2006 event was marred by drunken rioting in the Castle St area of Dunedin; resulting in 30 arrests and a liquor ban subsequently imposed on the main student area over the events weekend. After the incident ENSOC worked with the various local authorities in Ashburton, Timaru, Oamaru and Dunedin to minimise any possible disruption caused to local residents, including paying the Dunedin City Council to tow away any abandoned vehicles.\n\nIn 2007 the event saw further drunken rioting in which 69 people were arrested, on a night which one student involved described it as \"a usual Dunedin Saturday night\", while Dunedin emergency service workers said it was the city's worst trouble for many years. Crowd estimates were 1,000 – 2,000 at the height of the riots. Couches, a mattress and at least two Undie 500 cars were torched on Castle, Dundas, Hyde, Grange, and Leith streets, and police and fire-fighters were pelted with bottles. 9 of the 24 University of Canterbury students arrested were officially registered on the Undie 500, along with 30 Dunedin students and 15 non-students. Subsequently, there have been calls for an end to the event, with the Mayor of Dunedin Peter Chin calling the event 'history'.\n\nIn response to the rioting, police upgraded charges from disorderly behaviour to the more serious crime of rioting for 21 of the 69 arrested people, which could have resulted in up to 2 years in prison. These charges were later dropped by the police, with ten offenders pleading guilty and six pleading not guilty to lesser offences, resulting in at least one conviction for fifteen people. Furthermore, University of Otago students involved in the rioting also risked being expelled from the university. 31 people were charged at the Dunedin District Court, 22 being convicted (9 on two charges), and 5 receiving diversion. One charge of disorderly likely to cause violence was upheld on appeal to the High Court. The people convicted were forced to pay fines, reparations, donations and court costs exceeding $16,500 (up to $2,000 for some individuals), and received 250 hours community service, in addition to lawyers fees estimated at up to $1,000 to $5,000 each.\n\nChin later said he expected the event would go ahead for 2008, though he soon pulled out of meetings with ENSOC and emergency services. ENSOC had submitted a management plan with bonds and behavioural guarantees for participants, and had planned for a concert for the Saturday night after the official event, which has been the scene of the rioting in recent years. Meetings had been held with concert promoters with the aim of organizing a large event with a budget of over $100,000. Without approval, ENSOC are refusing to condone the 'underground' Undie 500 that they expect to occur.\n\nIn 2008 the official event was cancelled, but around 100 students from the University of Canterbury travelled to Dunedin in about 40 cars and vans. More than 100 police were rostered on for the event, and had placed checkpoints on the outskirts of Rolleston and the entrance to Dunedin city. The media once again reported the event sparked violence, with police in full riot gear three times charging a group of around 500 students throwing rocks and bottles, before dispersing the crowd in the early hours of 24 August 2008. While police Inspector Dave Campbell noted that the event was not a catalyst for the trouble, with most of those arrested from Otago University or non-students, he also said that to those persons \"It's quite clear that it [the Undie 500] is seen as a magnet.\" Around 30 arrests were made, in addition to 3 University of Canterbury and 2 University of Otago students from the previous night.\n\nAn official ENSOC charity event ran in 2009, after Dunedin Mayor Peter Chin refused to negotiate with the University of Canterbury Students Association and ENSOC to organise events after the main Undie rally to minimise disorder afterwards. About 600 students from Canterbury participated, bringing more than 1000 cans of food for Dunedin food banks. The \"Undie Charity Drive\" has been criticised by Chin as \"no matter how it is dressed up it is just a pub crawl.\" While the rally featured decorated cars, costumes and alcohol, new measures such as a good behaviour bond were introduced to address previous concerns. These measures, could, however, only be used to control behaviour by Canterbury University students, not Otago University students or the unemployed.\n\nOamaru, through which the event passes, was \"proactive\" (according to their community constable), and organised to deal with any increased littering or other anti-social behaviour as a result of the event. The town experienced no major problems, with only two arrests.\n\nThe event ran successfully, with partying afterwards becoming chaotic as police in riot gear moved in to be pelted with bottles, bricks and bicycle parts. Over two nights 80 arrests were made – around 80% University of Otago students, 10% University of Canterbury students, and 10% not students. In response to the disorder, Chin blamed Christchurch students. Police charged 67 people with a range of offences including breaching the temporary liquor ban, disorderly behaviour, obstruction and burning couches. Prime Minister John Key described the incident as \"madness\" and pointed out some students would consequently graduate with criminal convictions.\n\nIn the aftermath, OUSA president Edwin Darlow pointed out that as there was no way to stop the event, the council should consider alternative events over the weekend to reduce disorder after it finishes, though Chin has consistently refused to consider options ENSOC has proposed. Bystanders complained of being pepper sprayed by police in their own doorways. An 18-year-old Telford Rural Polytechnic student who travelled from Balclutha, specifically to be part of the \"Undie 500 weekend\", fell onto a burning couch while trying to jump over it. He was taken to Dunedin Public Hospital suffering burns, and required surgery.\n\nIn response to the event police minister Judith Collins said on 3 News the rioters were \"spoilt little rich kids, who think that they are going to be the future leaders of our country, and frankly if they are, God help us\".\n\nCharges against two of those arrested were withdrawn because police lacked valid evidence. On 14 September, the first three of those arrested appeared in court; one a Dunedin student, and two unemployed and employed persons respectively from Dunedin. The day after, a mill-hand and a process worker were convicted of breaching the liquor ban. Of those facing charges, 43 are tertiary students. The largest group was of 27 Otago University students, followed by 18 who are not tertiary students, six of whom were unemployed. On the 18th, one Otago student was convicted of theft for grabbing a police officers hat, valued at $80, for which he would later apologise to the officer. He was fined $500 with court costs of $130. Also convicted were two unemployed men and a shearer.\n\nThe harshest penalty imposed has been on a 41-year-old unemployed Dunedin man for breaching the City Council liquor ban. Eight people have had charges against them dropped for lack of evidence against them, and two discharged without conviction. One Dunedin student was suspended from the University for swearing at Dunedin University security staff, outside the University property, outside his flat.\n\nIn the year 2010 the Undie 500 Charity Drive was denied a liquor licence for an event that included a concert in Seddon. This was a blow to the event as it eventually led to the charity drive being cancelled in 2010. The committee ended up spending funds set asides on helping relief efforts for the Canterbury earthquake.\n\nAfter several meetings between event organisers ENSOC, the Dunedin police, Christchurch and the Dunedin city council the event was organised as a pub crawl that left from the university and returned to Christchurch. The event was kept off Facebook and the ENSOC website in an effort to keep it out of the media's attention, removing the negative publicity that is normally associated with the event.\n\nThe event consisted of leaving from the university arts car park, as in previous years, then heading out to the first pub in Yarldhurst. Both the participants and police were well behaved. Following that the event continued further out on to the Canterbury plains, finally ending back at a pub in Templeton, just out of Christchurch.\n\nThe name Undie 500 was revitalised in 2017 by former University of Otago student Ryan Hellyer, who created the new annual Undie 500 event as a special event for the Undiecar Championship, a sim racing series run on the iRacing platform. The most recent event in 2018 attracted 33 competitors.\n\n\n"}

The United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will provide benefits to veterans that the VA has determined suffer from PTSD, which developed during, or as a result of, their military service. These benefits not only include tax-free cash payments but can also include free or low-cost mental health treatment and other healthcare; vocational rehabilitation services; employment assistance; independent living support; and more.\n\nVA disability benefits for PTSD have evolved over time, in response to legislation, scientific advances, political pressure, revised diagnostic classification schemes, regulatory changes, case law, and administrative decisions. Veterans advocacy organizations, researchers, clinicians, politicians, administrators, and citizens will no doubt continue to influence how the United States evaluates, adjudicates, and administers the program. For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on vocational rehabilitation and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; and considering a veteran's quality of life as a factor in determining the disability rating.\n\nSince the founding of the country, the United States has sought to compensate the men and women who have served in its armed forces. In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed legislation emphasizing an indemnity model for veterans disability benefits. Congress sought to clarify and better specify provisions of the law in 1919 amendments to the original bill. Since that year, compensation has been provided to veterans suffering from physical or mental disabilities that were incurred during, or aggravated by, military service, and which have adversely impacted the veteran's ability to work. The amount of compensation provided—both cash payments and VA-sponsored services—are based on the veteran's \"average impairment in earnings capacity.\" Since OIF/OEF, PTSD has grown to be the third most compensated disability in the VA after hearing loss and tinnitus.\n\nWhether disability benefits adequately compensate veterans with PTSD for loss in average earning capacity has been debated. Older veterans age 65 and up rated at 50% disabled or higher for PTSD, including individual unemployability (IU) benefits, receive more in compensation (plus any earned income and retirement benefits such as Social Security or pensions) than nondisabled veterans earn in the workforce and/or receive in Social Security and other retirement benefits. However, younger veterans (age 55 and below) generally receive less in compensation benefits (plus any earned income) than their non-disabled counterparts earn via employment. For example, the \"parity ratio\" for a 25-year-old veteran rated 100% disabled by PTSD is 0.75, and for a 35-year-old veteran rated 100% disabled by PTSD the ratio is 0.69. The parity ratio for a 75-year-old veteran receiving IU benefits is 6.81.\n\nResearch indicates that veterans receiving disability benefits for PTSD experience a reduction in PTSD symptom severity, and have lower rates of poverty and homelessness.\n\nIn addition to lost income, a Congressionally-mandated commission, argued that the VA disability benefits program should compensate veterans for non-economic losses, particularly with regard to a veteran's overall quality of life. The U.S. Government Accountability Office analyzed this recommendation and suggested that it be considered as one of three major changes to modernize the VA disability benefits program.\n\nSome scholars argue that the VA disability benefits program is \"countertherapeutic\" because it provides no incentives to overcome symptoms and problems caused by the disorder, and, in fact rewards veterans for staying sick, while other researchers take issue with this assertion. In a similar vein, a military scholar, who lost both legs during combat operations in Iraq, suggests that current VA disability benefits policy inculcates in veterans a lack of self-efficacy and fosters dependency.\n\nTo begin the disability claim process, veterans submit a claim to the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), an organizational element of the VA. In order for a veteran to receive disability benefits for PTSD, the VBA, based on their review of medical and psychological evidence, must conclude that the veteran indeed suffers from service-connected PTSD. Reaching such a determination usually requires that the veteran receive a Compensation and Pension examination (C&P exam), which is a forensic mental health evaluation conducted by a psychologist or psychiatrist at a local VA medical facility or by a psychologist or psychiatrist in independent practice who conducts evaluations for a VA-contracted private vendor.\n\nThe VA provides a detailed description of the benefits claims process on its website. Briefly, a VSR (Veterans Service Representative), an employee of the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), reviews the information submitted by a veteran to determine if VBA needs any additional evidence (e.g., medical records) to adjudicate the claim.\n\nVA has a legal obligation to help veterans obtain any evidence that will support their claim. For example, the VSR might request a veteran's military personnel records, Social Security disability records, or private medical records. The VSR will almost always request a Compensation and Pension examination (C&P exam), also referred to as a \"VA claim exam\".\n\nAfter VBA obtains all relevant documentation (evidence), an RVSR (Ratings Veterans Service Representative) renders a decision regarding the veteran's claim. To speed up the decision process, it is advised that the claimant secure they own medical information from the facilities that they visited and provide them to the VA. If the VA has to request them it could hold up the process for 90 days. The RVSR refers in part to the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders when making this determination.\n\nVeterans may receive assistance with filing a VA disability compensation claim from Veterans Service Officers, also known as \"VSO Representatives\" or \"Veterans Service Representatives\". The veteran does not have to pay a Veterans Service Officer for their services. The VA recommends consulting with a Veterans Service Officer:\n\nVA encourages individuals who are applying for disability compensation to work with an accredited representative ... to assist them ... Being accredited means organizations and individuals must have VA permission to represent Veterans before the Department in their claims for VA benefits. The purpose of this requirement is to ensure that Veterans have qualified and competent representation. These individuals receive specialized training in VA benefits law and procedure. \n\nThere are two types of Veterans Service Officers:\n\n1) \"County Veterans Service Officers\" - Most states have established a veterans affairs agency to assist veterans, with offices in each county of the state staffed by County Veterans Service Officers.\n\n2) \"VSO Representatives\" are volunteers or employees of nonprofit Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs). In order to represent a veteran before the VA, a Veterans Service Organization must either have been Chartered by the U.S. Congress or have received official approval from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to represent veterans in the disability compensation claims process. From the federal government's perspective, the state veterans affairs agencies are \"veterans service organizations\" since they too must receive approval to represent veterans. Members choosing to use a VSO representative can partake in the VA's new Decision Ready Claim process . This ensures a claims decision within 30 days. \n\nSome veterans advocates recommend that veterans learn how to file claims on their own so that they retain control over the process.\n\nVeterans may appeal the VBA's decision regarding their compensation claim, and they may ask to be represented by an accredited Veterans Service Officer, attorney, or claims agent in the appeals process. Note that the VA does not \"require\" a veteran to be represented on appeal.\n\nVA prohibits attorneys or claims agents from charging a veteran for professional services prior to the adjudication of the veteran's claim. \nUnless they agree to work on a \"pro bono\" basis, attorneys and claims agents who represent veterans before the Veterans Benefits Administration, Board of Veterans Appeals, and Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims require payment for their services. At the federal court level, most attorneys work for Equal Access to Justice Act fees. These are attorney fees ordered by the court to be paid by the federal government when the government's position in litigation was not \"substantially justified.\"\n\nIf VBA determines that a veteran suffers from service-connected PTSD, then they assign a disability rating, expressed as a percentage. This disability rating determines the amount of compensation and other disability benefits the VA provides the veteran. The disability rating indicates the extent to which PTSD has deprived the veteran of his or her \"average earnings capacity\". A rating of 0% indicates that a veteran has PTSD but the disorder has not affected his or her ability to work, whereas a 100% rating theoretically means that the veteran is not capable of working at all because of PTSD.\n\nThe VA assigns disability ratings for PTSD according to the \"General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders\" (38 C.F.R. § 4.130), which specifies criteria for disability ratings of 0%, 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, or 100%.\n\nSome argue that by relying on the current \"Rating Formula\", \"VA uses decades-old regulations developed for mental disorders that do not resemble PTSD\", and, consequently, \"[i]rrelevant criteria ... may outweigh ... more relevant factors, leading VA to undercompensate veterans with valid diagnoses of PTSD.\" Similarly, veterans service organizations have argued, for example, that a \"... veteran service connected for schizophrenia and another veteran service connected for another psychiatric disorder should not be evaluated using the same general formula\" and have supported efforts to revise the \"Rating Formula\".\n\nConcern has been expressed by some RSVRs (VBA 'raters' who adjudicate claims) that automated software discourages their use of independent judgment to evaluate the claim as a whole, a charge senior VA officials reject.\n\nSince 2001, the VA has been revising its disability rating schedule to incorporate medical advances that have occurred since the last review, update medical terminology, add medical conditions not currently in the Rating Schedule, and refine criteria for further clarity, consistency and ease of rater application.\n\nA veteran currently receiving compensation for service-connected PTSD may file a claim for an increase in his or her disability rating (the VA also refers to this as an increased disability \"evaluation\",), or for \"individual unemployability\": If a veteran believes that PTSD, either alone or in combination with other service-connected disabilities (e.g., diabetes, a back injury, chronic pain, etc.), renders him or her incapable of pursuing and retaining gainful employment, and they meet the eligibility requirements, then they may file a compensation claim based on unemployability.\n\nAs noted above, VBA almost always requires a compensation and pension examination (C&P exam), also known as a \"VA claim exam\", for veterans claiming service-connected PTSD. There are two types of PTSD C&P exams: \"Initial\" and \"Review\". The \"Initial\" Examination for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder must be conducted by a VA psychologist or psychiatrist certified by the VHA Office of Disability and Medical Assessment (DMA) to evaluate veterans for this purpose. The definition of \"VA psychologist or psychiatrist\" includes psychologists and psychiatrists in the private sector who conduct C&P exams for a Medical Disability Evaluation (MDE) company under contract with the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) to provide C&P exam services on behalf of the VA. Although litigation ensued after award of the initial $6.8 billion MDE contracts in 2016, pending any further appeals, the companies with current VBA contracts are Logistics Health, Inc. (LHI); Veterans Evaluation Services (VES); QTC (QTC in turn contracted with Magellan Health to manage their network of providers); Medical Support Los Angeles, A Medical Corporation (MSLA); and VetFed.\n\nThe \"Review\" Evaluation for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder can be completed by VA \"or\" non-VA psychologists and psychiatrists. Clinical or counseling psychology interns, psychiatric residents, licensed clinical social workers, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse specialists may also conduct review PTSD exams, although they must be \"closely supervised\" by a psychologist or psychiatrist.\n\nResearchers, current and former VA psychologists, investigative journalists, and individual veterans have expressed concerns about the inter-rater reliability and validity of C&P exams for PTSD because:\n\nMental health professionals document the results of \"Initial\" and \"Review\" PTSD C&P exams on a Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ). The VA developed Disability Benefit Questionnaires (DBQs) to streamline the VBA ratings process and thereby complete the claims process faster. In addition, veterans may ask their treating clinicians to complete a DBQ and possibly bypass the need for a C&P exam. However, it is important to note that the VA discourages their \"mental health\" clinicians from completing DBQs for their patients, and similar recommendations have been offered to private psychologists and psychiatrists whose patients ask them to complete DBQs, because it potentially creates a conflict of interest due to a dual role relationship (serving simultaneously as a treating clinician and a forensic evaluator).\n\nC&P psychologists have expressed concern that the DBQ \"Symptom List\" (Section II, Number 5 on the \"Initial PTSD DBQ\"; Section VII on the \"Review PTSD DBQ\"; and Section III on the \"Mental Disorders DBQ\") contains a series of signs, symptoms, and descriptions of functional impairment without any guidance regarding when these items should be endorsed. These C&P examiners argue that such guidance is important because otherwise C&P examiners will (necessarily) use their own idiosyncratic judgments regarding when to endorse each item in the \"Symptom List\". In addition, the disability rating may be based largely on which \"Symptom List\" items are endorsed, since these items are drawn \"verbatim\" from the examples given for each level of impairment in the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders.\n\nIn order to be eligible for VA benefits, a veteran must have been discharged under \"other than dishonorable conditions\". Stated differently, if a veteran received a \"Bad Conduct\" discharge or a \"Dishonorable\" discharge they will, under most circumstances, not be eligible for VA benefits.\nThere are exceptions to the general rule that injuries or diseases incurred in, or aggravated by, military service are eligible for VA disability compensation benefits. For example, such injuries or diseases must meet the \"in line of duty\" criteria. \"\"In line of duty\" means an injury or disease incurred or aggravated during a period of active military, naval, or air service unless such injury or disease was the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or ... was a result of his or her abuse of alcohol or drugs.\"\nMatthew J. Friedman of the National Center for PTSD notes that:\n\nPTSD is unique among psychiatric diagnoses because of the great importance placed upon the etiological agent, the \"traumatic stressor\". In fact, one cannot make a PTSD diagnosis unless the patient has actually met the \"stressor criterion,\" which means that he or she has been exposed to an historical event that is considered traumatic.\n\nA \"traumatic stressor\" is an event that meets Criterion A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The definition of PTSD Criterion A in DSM-5 is:\n\nThe person was exposed to: death, threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or actual or threatened sexual violence, as follows: (one required)\n\n1. Direct exposure.\n\n2. Witnessing, in person.\n\n3. Indirectly, by learning that a close relative or close friend was exposed to trauma. If the event involved actual or threatened death, it must have been violent or accidental.\n\n4. Repeated or extreme indirect exposure to aversive details of the event(s), usually in the course of professional duties (e.g., first responders, collecting body parts; professionals repeatedly exposed to details of child abuse). This does not include indirect non-professional exposure through electronic media, television, movies, or pictures.\n\nRelevant regulations, were updated on August 4, 2014 to reflect the publication of DSM-5. Thus, as of August 4, 2014, C&P examiners began using DSM-5 when diagnosing veterans' mental disorders.\n\nThe term, \"service-connected\", means that a veteran has a disease or injury that is \"connected\" to his or her military service, i.e., the disease or injury was incurred in, or aggravated by, his or her military service.\n\nThe official definition in the Code of Federal Regulations begins:\n\nService connection connotes many factors but basically it means that the facts, shown by evidence, establish that a particular injury or disease resulting in disability was incurred coincident with service in the Armed Forces, or if preexisting such service, was aggravated therein.\n\nThe relationship between service connection and access to VA healthcare is emphasized in this definition: 'Service connected' veterans are those with documented, compensative conditions related to or aggravated by military service, and they receive priority for enrollment into the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. \n\nThe regulations describe three categories of military service, \"active duty\", \"active duty for training\", and \"inactive duty training\". Eligibility for VA disability compensation requires that the veteran's service occurred during one of these three categories. The definition of \"active duty\" military service includes \"service at any time as a cadet at the United States Military, Air Force, or Coast Guard Academy, or as a midshipman at the United States Naval Academy.\"\n\n\n\n"}

The series was started in 2008 and was a sports car series that ran only in North America, the series quietly folded in 2011.\n\nThe series was open to only drivers between the ages of 16 and 26 who held a passport from the United States, Canada, or Mexico. The entry fee for drivers is $45,000. In addition to more than $50,000 in prize money at stake during the season, the series champion received Volkswagen factory career advancement support with a value up to $100,000.\n\nThe cars were 2009 Volkswagen Jettas that were modified by the factory for the series. Once completed, the cars were still about 70% stock with the other 30% made up of parts from the VW parts bin, one-off brackets and mounts, and race prepping from outside parties. The cars feature VW's DSG twin shaft, dual clutch automatic transmission and have height adjustable Sachs race suspension. Brakes were controlled by an ATE Racing ABS system and utilize Brembo 4 piston fixed calipers in front and Lucas 1 piston floating caliper disc brakes in the rear. The tires are racing slicks provided by Pirelli. The minimum race weight for the car with driver and equipment is . The safety equipment on each car included but was not limited to airbags, seat belts, roll cage, fire extinguishers, and an FIA rated racing seat.\n\n\nThe point system used was similar to other race series in that the most points are awarded to the first place finisher and points are reduced for subsequent finishing places. The Volkswagen Jetta TDI Cup is unique in that the points are halved for the first two races compared to the points for the rest of the season.\n\n† Shane Williams was a guest driver from the ADAC Polo Cup race series in Germany.<br>\n‡ David Jurca was awarded the points for a first place finish since Shane Williams did not accrue points in USA race.\nFor points purposes 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place finishers were awarded the points for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd respectively.\n†† Liam Kenney was penalized 20 points for passing the leader, Josh Hurley under double yellow.\n\n"}
