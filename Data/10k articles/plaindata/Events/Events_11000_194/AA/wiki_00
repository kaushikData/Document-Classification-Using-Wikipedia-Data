The aim of the offensive was to cut the last rebel supply line into Aleppo city.\n\nBy late July, the military had managed to sever the last rebel supply line coming from the north and completely surround Aleppo. However, within days, the rebels launched a large-scale counter-attack south of Aleppo in an attempt to both open a new supply line into rebel-held parts of the city and cut-off the government-held side. The whole campaign, including both the Army's offensive and subsequent rebel counter-offensive, was seen by both sides as possibly deciding the fate of the entire war.\n\nThe battle was also notable for the large loss of top rebel field commanders, with about three dozen being killed.\n\nBy early September, Syrian government troops had cemented their siege of the rebel part of the city.\n\nThe offensive began on 25 June, with heavy Russian air-strikes and ground bombardment. On 26 June, the military made advances into the Mallah Farms, and by 28 June, they had captured half of the farmlands, including the Al-Asamat and Arab Salum areas. The advances brought the Castello Road within firing range of the military's artillery.\n\nAfter midnight on 7 July, amid heavy airstrikes, pro-government forces captured the southern part of Mallah and came within one kilometer of the Castello Road. They captured a mosque complex and a hill which overlook the Castello Road, thus enabling them to bring the road under artillery fire-control. This effectively cut off the only supply route to the rebel-held part of Aleppo.\n\nSeveral days later, the Army advanced in the al-Layramoun al-Khalidiyah and Bani Zeid districts. During this time, government troops captured the Sadkop Gas Factory.\n\nBy the evening of 13 July, the military secured the whole al-Khalidiyah district and most of the al-Layramoun industrial area, after capturing the last several rebel-held buildings in al-Khalidiyah, as well as al-Layramoun’s gas factory, market and glass factory.\n\nOn 17 July, the Army and Hezbollah reached the Castello Road, capturing parts of it and completely cutting it after taking control of Castello Hill. With this advance, the rebel-held part of Aleppo city was fully besieged and the al-Layramoun roundabout came under artillery fire-control. Meanwhile, the military made more advances in the Bani Zeid and al-Layramoun areas, capturing most of the factories.\n\nBetween 23 and 25 July, the Army expanded its control in the al-Layramoun industrial area by capturing the Textile Factory a dozen industrial buildings and two malls. Late on 25 July, the Tiger Forces captured two sites in and near the Castillo Complex, threatening to cut off the rebels remaining at Bani Zeid and al-Layramoun.\n\nOn 26 July, government forces captured all of the al-Layramoun District after heavy fighting for the last rebel stronghold there, the Bus Station. After also seizing the Al-Castillo Amusement Park and imposing fire control over Bani Zeid, the remaining rebel forces in Aleppo City were left almost completely besieged.\n\nOn 27 July, rebel forces attacked the Kurdish-held areas of Aleppo, although their attack was repelled. The Kurds then proceeded to advance into the nearby rebel-held Bani Zeid Youth Housing neighborhood and captured the whole complex. Later that day, the Army officially declared it had cut off all rebel supply routes into Aleppo. On 28 July, the military captured the Bani Zeid district, as well as the rebel-held parts of the Ashrafiyah district. The rebels withdrew from Bani Zeid before the main Army assault so to avoid heavy losses. The Army then continued to push its assault towards the Dahret Abdrubbah area.\n\nOn 30 July, the Kurdish YPG captured the Shuqayyif Youth Housing area, next to the Castello Road.\n\nOn 31 July, the Army of Conquest launched a counter-offensive both south and north of Aleppo in an attempt to lift the siege on the rebel-held areas of the city. Fierce fighting was reported at the Al-Castillo Highway, while the rebels managed to capture the Al-Hikma school and two hills on the southern outskirts of Aleppo, which constituted an advanced Army defense line. The wide-scale rebel counter-attack reportedly included 8,000–10,000 fighters, 95 tanks, hundreds of rocket launchers and a large number of suicide-bombers. By evening, the rebels also took control of Al-‘Amariyah village and reached the nearby 1070 Al-Hamadaniyah Housing Project where fighting continued. During the night, the 1070 Al-Hamadaniyah Housing Project was also taken by the rebels.\n\nThe next day, the rebels once again advanced and took control of Mushrifah village (also known as Sharfa), that is situated on a hill that overlooks the Al-Assad Military Academy.\n\nOver the next several days, back-and-forth fighting took place for control of the 1070 Housing Project neighborhood, Huwayz village, Al-‘Amariyah and several hills.\n\nOn 5 August, a rebel attack on the Military Academy started and by the next day the rebels took control of more than half of the Military Academy. Shortly after their advances at the Military Academy, rebels both inside and outside Aleppo advanced into the Ramouseh neighborhood, linked up and captured it. With this advance, the rebels managed to cut the government's supply line into the government-held part of west Aleppo and announced the Army's siege of rebel-held east Aleppo had been broken. However, the new rebel supply line was still under Army artillery fire and being hit by air-strikes, making both sides essentially under siege. Since the rebel offensive started, at least 130 civilians had been killed, most by rebel shelling of government-held districts. 500 fighters on both sides also died, mostly rebels. At the end of the day, the rebels were in control of the entire Military Academy base and the Ramouseh district.\n\nOn 7 August, fighting was still continuing in the Ramouseh district, where it was confirmed the Army was still in control of parts of the area. The government, backed by Russia, launched an intensive air-strike campaign, in which one of the military schools captured by the rebels was reportedly leveled. Meanwhile, the rebels were putting up a \"massive\" defense to protect the new corridor. The next day, the Ramouseh district was confirmed to be completely under rebel control, while the Army recaptured al-Sanobrat hill.\n\nOn 11 August, the rebels attacked the government supply route to Aleppo between Khanasir and Ithriya, capturing Mahmyat Al-Ghazal. However, the Army recaptured the village the following day.\n\nBetween 11 and 17 August, the Army launched several counter-attacks, primarily against the 1070 Housing Project. During the fighting on 11 August 29 government and up to 20 rebel fighters were killed. By 17 August, government forces recaptured about 70 percent of the district.\n\nOn 17 August, after capturing most of the 1070 Al-Hamdaniyah Housing Project, government forces also stormed the Air Force Technical Base. The former government commander of the base Brig. Gen. Deeb Bazi was killed as he led the assault. Back-and-forth fighting at the Academy continued into early September, when on 4 September, pro-government forces finally overwhelmed the rebel defenders and captured the whole complex. Thus, government troops reestablished the siege of rebel-held areas of Aleppo.\n\nAlso during this time, on 21 August, government forces captured Umm Qara hill that overlooks the Khan Touman-Ramouseh Road near Al-Qarassi, as well as nearby SyriaTel hill. Multiple rebel counter-attacks in an attempt to recapture Umm Qara hill were eventually repelled.\n\nOn 5 September, rebel frontlines in southern Aleppo collapsed, with pro-government forces overrunning three villages, three hills, two factories, two storage facilities, an Air Defense Base and a quarry.\n\nBetween 6 and 8 September, the Syrian Army captured the whole Ramouseh district, reopening the Ramouseh Road to supply government-held western Aleppo by 9 September.\n\nOn 10–11 September, the Syrian Army and its allies continued to advance in the 1070 Al-Hamdaniyah Housing Project and the Al-‘Amariyah District. They also continued to target the Hikmah School.\n\nOn 11 September, airstrikes interrupted Eid al-Adha celebrations in rebel-held areas of Aleppo and Idlib. US and Russian officials negotiated a ceasefire hours prior, which was to go into effect later the following day at sundown.\n\nAfter the implementation of the ceasefire in mid-September, the Syrian Army withdrew its forces from the Castello road to allow UN humanitarian aid into the eastern parts of the city. However, rebel groups outside the city did not allow humanitarian aid convoys into Aleppo. Later, as Russian Marines and Syrian Red Crescent personnel controlling Castello road came under fire by rebel groups, the SAA redeployed its soldiers once again.\n\nOn 16 September, the Russian Air Force carried out numerous airstrikes around Aleppo for the first time since the ceasefire had been reached four days earlier. On 19 September, an aid convoy from the United Nations and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent consisting of more than 18 trucks was reportedly hit by air-to-surface missiles as they headed for eastern Aleppo from the town of Urum al-Kubra, killing 12 people and severely injuring several more. At the same time, Russia and Syria restarted heavy bombing raids on rebels in the city.\n\nEarly on 21 September, the Syrian Army seized most of Hikma Hill, thus being on the verge of recapturing Al-Hikma school and the 1070 Housing Project. However, later in the day, the rebels retook the positions they lost on the hill. Still, the Army managed to capture areas of the Ramouseh district that had been rebel-held since late 2012. Meanwhile, SOHR claimed that 3,000 Russian soldiers had arrived at Aleppo to support new government offensives in the area.\n\nOn 22 September, the Syrian Army launched a new offensive into the rebel-held eastern neighborhoods. Government forces also made further progress in southern Aleppo, capturing a few sites.\n\nA new rebel attempt to break the siege starting in late October 2016, failed after two weeks of fighting, and consequently all major rebel positions in East Aleppo were overrun by pro-government and Kurdish forces by 13 December 2016.\n\n"}
{"id": "54304547", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54304547", "title": "All the Money in the World", "text": "All the Money in the World\n\nAll the Money in the World is a 2017 crime thriller film directed by Ridley Scott and written by David Scarpa, based on John Pearson's 1995 book \"Painfully Rich: The Outrageous Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Heirs of J. Paul Getty\". The film stars Michelle Williams, Christopher Plummer, Mark Wahlberg, and Romain Duris. The film depicts J. Paul Getty's refusal to cooperate with the extortion demands of a group of kidnappers from the organized crime Mafia group 'Ndrangheta, who abducted his grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973.\n\nPrincipal photography took place from March to August 2017. Kevin Spacey originally portrayed J. Paul Getty, appearing in the film's initial marketing campaign. However, after multiple sexual misconduct allegations were leveled against Spacey, the role was recast with Plummer. Scenes were reshot just a month prior to the film's release.\n\n\"All the Money in the World\" premiered at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on December 18, 2017, followed by a United States theatrical release via TriStar Pictures on December 25, 2017; it grossed $57 million against its $50 million budget. For his performance as Getty, Christopher Plummer received acclaim from critics and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, along with similar recognition from the Golden Globes, BAFTAs and others. The film itself received positive reviews with critics praising the performances, and received three nominations at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, including Best Director and Best Actress – Drama for Williams.\n\nIn 1973, 16-year-old John Paul Getty III (Charlie Plummer) (AKA Paul), grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty (Christopher Plummer) who was at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in Rome by an organized crime ring. The kidnappers demand a ransom of $17 million. Flashbacks show that Paul's parents, Gail Harris (Michelle Williams) and John Paul Getty Jr. (Andrew Buchan), were divorced in 1971 due to Getty Jr.'s drug addiction and that Gail rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children in the divorce settlement; therefore she does not have the means to pay the ransom. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but he refuses, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings on his family members. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom. Meanwhile, Getty asks Fletcher Chace (Mark Wahlberg), a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release.\n\nPaul is kept hostage in a remote location in Italy. Initially his captors, particularly Cinquanta (Romain Duris), are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. Things get worse when one of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, prompting one of the others to kill the man for his foolish mistake. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.\n\nUsing the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he had been sold on to a new crime organization. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid.\n\nAfter repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million – this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them. Berated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. However, a frightened Paul runs away from the site towards the nearest town, miles away. Meanwhile the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive at the town to look for Paul. One of the kidnappers finds Paul first, but Cinquanta attacks the man in order to allow Paul to escape. Chace and Gail find Paul and smuggle him out of the country to safety.\n\nGetty dies of unrelated causes, and Gail is tasked with managing her children's inherited wealth until they are of age. The company was set up as a charitable trust, which meant that Getty's income was tax-free but also not spendable. He had invested much of it in paintings, sculptures and other artifacts, most of them now reside in the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.\n\nOn March 13, 2017, it was reported that Ridley Scott was finalizing plans to direct the David Scarpa-scripted \"All the Money in the World\", a film about the kidnapping of John Paul Getty III. Scott stated that he was attracted to the project because of Scarpa's script, adding \"I just consumed it [...] I knew about the kidnapping, but this story was very, very provocative... Gail Getty was an exceptional character, and there are many facets of the man Getty that make him a really great study. There's this great dynamic. It was like a play, and not a movie.\"\n\nNatalie Portman was initially pursued for the role of Gail Harris. On March 31, 2017, it was reported that Michelle Williams and Kevin Spacey were circling the roles of Harris and J. Paul Getty, respectively, while Mark Wahlberg was in talks for an unspecified role. On casting Spacey, Scott stated, \"When I read the script, I started thinking, 'Who was Paul Getty?' In my mind, I saw Kevin Spacey. Kevin's a brilliant actor, but I've never worked with him, and I always knew I would have to have him portray Getty in this film [...] He was so obsessed with what he was doing [...] He wasn't giving people a second thought.\" In regards to Williams, Scott stated that while she was not his first choice, \"Michelle is very special as an actress, and I've never done anything with her before [...] The family was very private and there was very little footage of [Gail], but around the kidnapping, there was one particular interview she did that Michelle jumped at, and it shows Gail Getty being very assertive, very smart,\" both qualities Williams possessed. On May 2, Charlie Plummer joined the cast as John Paul Getty III. Timothy Hutton was added to the cast on June 16.\n\nOn May 31, 2017, it was reported that \"All the Money in the World\" had begun principal photography. Filming continued at Elveden Hall in west Suffolk for a week at the end of July. The aristocratic Grade II-listed stately home was used to represent a Moroccan palace in the filming of a series of flashback scenes. Spacey had worked for just ten days on the film. The original production reportedly concluded in August.\n\nIn late October, numerous sexual harassment and sexual assault allegations were made against Kevin Spacey. The film's premiere at the AFI Fest on November 16 was cancelled, and its Academy Awards campaign – which focused on Spacey's supporting role – was reworked.\n\nOn November 8, it was announced that although the film was otherwise ready for release, reshoots had been commissioned with Christopher Plummer replacing Spacey in the role of Getty. Despite his earlier statements to the contrary, Scott claimed that Plummer had been his original choice for the role, and that studio executives had persuaded him to cast the \"bigger name\" Spacey. Spacey still appears in one wide shot that would have been too expensive or complex to reshoot within the release deadline; the scene features Getty disembarking from a train in the desert, but Spacey's face is not visible.\n\nReshoots with Plummer went from November 20 to 29, with the first footage of Plummer in the role released in a new trailer the same day. The decision cost millions of dollars in rush fees, among other costs, to meet the film's late-December release. The reshoots ended up costing $10 million, making the final production cost of the film $50 million.\n\nWhile it was initially reported that the actors filmed the reshoots for free, it was later revealed that Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million while Williams only received $80 in per diems, as she was contractually obligated to appear in reshoots, while Wahlberg was not. Wahlberg's fee for the original shooting is alleged by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" to have been $5 million, while Williams is reported to have been paid $625,000. \"The New York Times\" has reported that Wahlberg was paid 80% less than his usual fee. The $1.5 million Wahlberg received for reshoots was in addition to this. Wahlberg's contract allowed him to approve co-stars, reportedly refusing to approve Plummer as Spacey's replacement unless he was paid extra. In response to the backlash brought on by the difference in the actors' pay, Wahlberg announced he would donate the $1.5 million to the Time's Up movement in Williams' name.\n\nIn September 2018, Dame Judi Dench criticised the decision to remove her \"good friend\" Kevin Spacey's performance from the film. Dench was reported to have said \"I can't approve, in any way, of the fact – whatever he has done – that you then start to cut him out of films\".\n\nThe film premiered at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, California on December 18, 2017. In the United States, the film was originally slated for a release on December 22, 2017, but two weeks before its debut, it was pushed to December 25, to avoid competition with \"\".\n\n\"All the Money in the World\" grossed $25.1 million in the United States and Canada and $31.8 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $56.9 million, against a production budget of $50 million.\n\nOn Christmas Day, the film's opening day, it grossed $2.6 million from 2,068 theaters. In its first full weekend the film made $5.4 million from 2,074 theaters, finishing 7th at the box office. In its second weekend the film made $3.6 million, dropping 36% and finishing 10th.\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 78% based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"All the Money in the World\" offers an absorbing portrayal of a true story, brought compellingly to life by a powerful performance from Christopher Plummer.\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nWriting for \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Todd McCarthy said, \"[Scott and Plummer] show what they're made of in \"All the Money in the World\", a terrifically dexterous and detailed thriller about the Italian mob's 1973 kidnapping for ransom of the grandson of the world's richest man, John Paul Getty [sic].\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film three out of four stars, commending it as a whole despite criticizing the middle section as repetitive, and the character of J. Paul Getty being \"repugnant\" without proper context. He stated that \"The film is also a testament to the awesome work ethic of its 80-year old but still apparently tireless director, who fired Kevin Spacey... they're worth noting because the end product is much better than anyone could have expected, considering the challenges faced and met by all involved.\"\n\nWriting for \"New York\" magazine, David Edelstein gave a strong review for the performance of Michelle Williams in the film, stating: \"My guess is that there was one overriding factor in Scott's decision to rebuild sets and summon back his actors (after the Spacey controversy): The fear that Spacey's presence would distract the world (which includes Oscar voters) from the marvelous performance of Michelle Williams as Gail. It's a real transformation. I've never heard this diction from her before — sharp, with a hint of North Shore (i.e., old money) Long Island and perhaps a Kennedy or two. (The real Gail grew up in San Francisco but was well acquainted with the cadences of the East Coast rich.) Through the tension in her body and intensity of her voice, Williams conveys not just the terror of losing a son but the tragic absurdity of bearing the illustrious name Getty when family ties confer zero power.\"\n\n\n"}

Previously it had been held in April/May at the International Passenger Terminal at Sydney's Circular Quay, and prior to that at Fox Film Studios, Moore Park and Melbourne's St Kilda pier.\n\nMercedes-Benz Fashion Week Australia has helped bring attention to a number of Australian designers such as Lisa Ho, Alex Perry, Zimmermann, Toni Maticevski, Collette Dinnigan, Leona Edmiston, J'Aton Couture, Ericaamerica, Easton Pearson and Gwendolynne.\n\nThe event was the brainchild of PR consultant and former ski magazine reporter Simon Lock. Launched in 1996, in its debut year the event featured shows by Australian designers including Akira Isogawa, Alex Perry and Wayne Cooper. The event had mixed success; British fashion writer Susan Owens wrote a scathing review dubbing it \"Fashion Weak\" and writing that 25 broken-hearted designers had thrown away their money.\n\nIn 2005, event founder Simon Lock sold the event and its parent company Australian Fashion Innovators to the New York-based International Management Group. The deal was rumoured to have been worth several million dollars.\n\nRosemount Estate wineries acquired naming rights from Mercedes-Benz in 2006 and the event was renamed Rosemount Australian Fashion Week (RAFW), but the principal sponsorship passed back to Mercedes-Benz in 2011.\n\nLock worked with IMG for the next five years before departing the company in 2010. In 2011 he was presented with the Australian Fashion Laureate award, the first non-designer to receive it. At the time he was building a ski hotel in Japan and spending more time with his children.\n\nAustralian Fashion Week has attracted criticism of being out of sync with the global fashion market; some popular designers pulled out of the 2012 event in order to prepare for international events.\n\nThe event has also been criticised for featuring inexperienced emerging designers rather than big names, that its collections are conspicuously 'influenced' by European designers, and that it resorts to cheap theatrics that have included everything from Afghan hounds to midgets in lederhosen.\n\nHowever, fashion journalist Marion Hume argues that the non-participation of established designers is welcome. \"It lets those designers grow [by going overseas] and gives space for younger ones to come up,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and shows a healthiness in Australian Fashion Week.”\n\nThe event relies heavily on the participation of international celebrities. In 1997, supermodel Linda Evangelista's appearance in the Alex Perry show drew international attention to the event.

As retailers struggled with declining sales, MBFF was pitched as an event to show consumers how to wear the clothes currently on the retail racks. IMG fashion hosts the whole event. IMG also has control over the whole Australian Fashion Week and festival.\n\nAlthough Mercedes-Benz Fashion Festival Sydney is primarily based during Australian Fashion week, they also support and put together runway shows throughout the year for the designer brands they support. In May 2013, the festival hosted a fashion focused seminar featuring Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Australia designers Camilla and Marc and KIRRILY JOHNSTON. This is just one of the many external events outside the festival that MBFFS contributes to.\n\nMany well-known and influential designers as well as new and upcoming designers participate in the fashion festival. Some of the designers include Alice Mccall, Bec & Bridge, Ginger & Smart, Ksubi, Lisa Ho, Oroton, We Are Handsome, and Whitesands.\n\nMercedes-Benz Fashion Festival Brisbane is a schedule of fashion events showcasing the contemporary Spring Summer Collections of Australia’s leading designer brands. The festival is held at the Brisbane Town Hall and throughout the city in August.\n\n"}

Camp Hope has welcomed people from all over the United States and all over the world who have come to participate in the massive recovery efforts of St. Bernard Parish and New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.\n\nCamp Hope provides affordable housing and meals for groups and individuals who have come to serve St Bernard parish and the city of New Orleans. Breakfast and dinner are served throughout the work week, as well as the option to make sack lunches to take on volunteer work sites. The facilities include a large dining area, bathrooms, showers, laundry facilities, meeting rooms, and bunk rooms with enough space to sleep over 300 individuals. \n\nCamp Hope opened on June 1, 2006, in the former \"W. Smith Junior Elementary School\" in Violet, Louisiana due to the closure of Camp Premiere, a FEMA-sponsored base camp established to provide basic life support for emergency response activities. Col. David Dysart (USMCR), the Director of The St. Bernard Parish Office of Recovery, formed alliances with multiple Non-Profit Organizations, volunteer groups and the St. Bernard School Board to relocate the camp and ensure the continued support necessary for the critical volunteer efforts to continue. The opening was facilitated by several AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps teams and overseen by St. Bernard Parish employee Tom Pfalzer.\n\nThe mission of Camp Hope then, in addition to providing low-cost volunteer housing, was to facilitate volunteer relief efforts in St. Bernard Parish and in the New Orleans area. This effort included managing and participating in the removal of health and safety hazards internal to residential properties throughout St. Bernard Parish (gutting houses i.e. removing rotting furniture, drywall, kitchen appliances that held biohazards as well as more ordinary hazards such as mercury switches used in thermostats and household chemicals) and facilitate repatriation by displaced residents as a cost effective alternative to unnecessary demolition, with the assistance of the local, state, federal, NCCC, and other volunteer and non-governmental agencies. At the end of the debris removal process, volunteers in St. Bernard had gutted over 2,500 homes in St. Bernard Parish at no cost to their owners.\n\nIn January 2007, Camp Hope changed its mission to focus on rebuilding and new construction. Camp Hope was managed by the New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International. August 15, 2007, Camp Hope moved to the former \"Beauregard Middle School\" which was named after P.G.T. Beauregard, a notable Civil War General who fought for the Confederacy, in the township of St. Bernard, LA. Most volunteers who stay at Camp Hope volunteer with New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity or with the St. Bernard Project (located in Chalmette, LA) though any volunteer is welcome.\n\nIn January 2010, Camp Hope reopened under St. Bernard Parish management at a new location in Arabi LA, inside the building of former St. Louise de Marillac. In the spring of 2011, as a result of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill the former Camp Hope was re-purposed to house clean-up workers.\n\nIn 2012, St. Bernard Parish Government decided to pull out of the management of Camp Hope. In February 2012, a local non-profit called The Gathering took over the management of Camp Hope. They continue to run it to this day.\n\nCamp Hope 2 in Beauregard Middle School closed in May 2009.Camp Hope to close after providing a temporary home to thousands who helped Camp Hope 3 is run jointly by volunteers and the St. Bernard Parish government.\n\nCamp Hope 3, which opened on January 1, 2010, was located in the building of a former Catholic school located in Arabi, Louisiana.\n\nCamp Hope 3 was closed in June 2010 and the space was turned over to house BP employees who worked to clean up the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. BP has spent $600,000 on renovations to house 300 oil spill personnel in 2010.\n\nCamp Hope 3 opened again in March 2011 in what was previously a school and is located in Arabi, Louisiana\n\nIn February 2012, Camp Hope 3 was taken under new management by The Gathering, a non-profit in Arabi, Louisiana.\n\n\n"}

Sponsored by the \"Chicago Times-Herald\", the race was held in Chicago in 1895 between six cars and won by Frank Duryea's Motorized Wagon. The race created considerable publicity for the motocycle, which had been introduced in the United States only two years earlier.\n\nOn July 10, 1895, the \"Chicago Times-Herald\" announced a race to be held in the city, prizes totaling $5,000 (approximately $ in ). The promotion was an attempt to foster growth of the young auto industry in the United States and to boost newspaper sales. The first automobiles in the nation were produced only two years earlier, and they were so new at the time that the paper's editors could not easily agree upon a name for them. After considerable wrangling, the editors decided to call it a Moto Cycle race, and first used the term in a July 15 article.\n\nThe original course of the race was to run from Chicago north to Milwaukee, but the roads were found to be too poor for early cars to easily traverse. The route was changed to be only from Chicago to Evanston and back. The finish line was near what is now the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry (what had been the Palace of Fine Arts at the 1893 Columbian Exposition). The race was intended to be held on November 2, but few cars had shown up, and the race was rescheduled. Eighty-three cars were initially entered into the race, but only six arrived for the actual competition. Many of the entrants did not have their cars completed on time, and several were unable to make the journey. Elwood Haynes' car, which was a favorite to win the race, was damaged en route and unable to compete.\n\nBoth Haynes and the driver of a Benz car were stopped by police while driving their cars into the city. They were forced to requisition horses to pull the cars: as the police informed them, they had no right to drive their vehicles on the city streets. The situation caused the race to again be postponed while the Times-Herald editors convinced the city leaders to pass an ordinance to confirm the right of these vehicles to travel on city streets. Once the ordinance passed, the race was held on November 28, Thanksgiving Day. The day was snowy and 38 °F (4 °C), the roads muddy, with snow drifts in places.\n\nThe first car to arrive at the starting line was a German-made car by inventor Karl Benz. In total, three Benz cars ran in the race. The only other four-wheeled car to run in the race was Frank Duryea's motorized wagon. The two other vehicles that took part were two-wheeled automobiles. The \"motorcycles\" lacked the power to climb one of the course's grades. Another entrant was electric-powered, and its battery died because of the cold weather before getting very far. Just after starting, one Benz struck a horse, and was forced to leave the race. On the return trip the Duryea began to take the lead.\n\nThe Duryea car finished the race first, completing the race after 7 hours and 53 minutes of running time, 10 hours and 23 minutes total time, having traveled an average of . The Benz entered by Oscar B. Mueller crossed the finish line an hour and a half later. From point 31 of the course to the finish Mueller's car was driven by Charles Brady King because Mueller went unconscious from exposure. King was originally an umpire to the race and of this motocycle. None of the other vehicles finished.\n\nThe race was the first known automobile race in the United States. Newspapers across the country carried stories about the race and many predicted the coming demise of horse-borne transportation, citing the cars' ability to travel even in poor weather. The success of the race sped up the rate of automobile development by at least five years in the United States due to the publicity of the event. The commercial production of American automobiles began only a year later.\n\nThe contest rules published prior to the race stated the following prizes were available.\n\nThe Fort Worth Gazette stated, \"The prizes will be awarded on the showing made in the road race, and in the scientific tests which have been made under the supervision of the best experts in the country.\" But it was not until December 5, 1895 that the official prize results were announced. The race judges determined that, \"All contestants violated the rules of the race. None of the three contestants which finished at Jackson Park kept the course.\"\n\n\"The judges were compelled to make their awards based on the showing in the tests and in the road race. The test took precedence in the rules, but the remarkable run made by Duryea and Mueller compelled substantial recognition. It was deemed fair to make an award of the gold medal based largely on tests, and it therefore, went to Morris-Salom. The other awards were made on road performances and on special points in design.\" Total prize money awarded was $5,000.\n\nThe Smithsonian Institution states the following regarding the winning Duryea car. \"This car was unfortunately destroyed through a workman's misunderstanding many years ago.\" The second-place car of Hieronymus Mueller is on display in the Mueller Museum in Decatur, Illinois.\n\nIn addition to the enormous amount of publicity the race generated, several other automotive developments were related to this race.\n\n\n"}

Houston, the newspapers implied, had been involved in a sexual relationship with Green for several months. The shooting took place at the home of Willie West, who chased down Houston after the shooting and turned him over to the city police.\n\nGreen's murder and Houston's trial in the spring of 1901 were reported in the \"Savannah Morning News\" and the \"Savannah Evening Press\". Although Houston reportedly had confessed to the murder at the time of his arrest, at his trial he claimed the shooting was accidental. Other witnesses, however, testified that Houston had become angry after Green called him \"a son of a bitch\".\n\nHouston was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, on the jury's recommendation of mercy. After serving more than twelve years, he was paroled by Governor John M. Slaton in 1913. Accounts of his later life are sketchy, but he is said to have died in New York City in 1927 after other brushes with the law.\n\nGreen was buried in an unmarked grave in Laurel Grove Cemetery South in Savannah.\n\nSongs based on Delia Green's murder became both common and popular in the next few decades. In 1928, folklorist Robert Winslow Gordon reported to the Library of Congress that he had traced the songs back to a murder in Savannah and that he had interviewed both Green's mother and the police officer who took Houston into custody.\n\nGordon's research was never published, and Green's relationship to the popular songs was essentially unknown until Prof. John F. Garst, working from hints left by Gordon, turned up the details in Savannah newspaper archives.\n\nThe songs inspired by Green's murder now appear in two forms; both forms were staples of the \"folk revival\" of the 1950s and early 1960s. One version, usually attributed to Blake Alphonso Higgs, is known as \"Delia's Gone\". It is explicitly told from her killer's point of view. The second version, usually attributed to Blind Willie McTell, is usually known as \"Delia\" and is told from an ambiguous point of view. \n\nAmong the many singers who have covered \"Delia\" are Bob Dylan and David Bromberg. Josh White and Pete Seeger each recorded \"Delia's Gone\" in 1955, followed by Harry Belafonte, Bud and Travis, Burl Ives, The Kingston Trio, and other \"folk revival\" singers. Pat Boone had a minor hit with \"Delia Gone\" in 1960, with the composition attributed to Caperton Henley.\n\nIt was recorded numerous times by country singers, including Bobby Bare, Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. In the music video for Cash's fourth recording of the song, the role of Delia was played by Kate Moss.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "37968158", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37968158", "title": "Dożynki", "text": "Dożynki\n\nDożynki (\"Dozhinki\", , , ; , \"Prachystaya\"; ; ; \"Dormition\") is a Slavic harvest festival. In pre-Christian times the feast usually fell on the autumn equinox, in modern times it is usually celebrated on one of the Sundays following the end of the harvest season, which fall on different days in different regions of Europe.\n\nThe feast was initially associated with the pagan Slavic cult of plants, trees and agriculture. In 16th century in Central and Eastern Europe it gained a Christian character and started to be organised by the landed gentry and more affluent peasants as a means to thank the reapers and their families for their work, both during the harvest and during the past year.\n\nWhile there are many regional varieties and traditions, most have some aspects in common. Often the peasants or farmers celebrating \"dożynki\" gather in the fields outside their village, form a procession and bring back a sheaf or the last batch of cereal reaped from nearby fields. The women would then turn it into a wreath and offer it to the guest of honour (usually the organiser of the celebration: a local noble, the richest farmer in the village or – in modern times – the vogt or other representative of the authorities).\n\nIn Poland, where the tradition survived to modern times, the feast and accompanying rituals are known under a variety of names depending on the region. The prevalent term is \"dożynki\", but \"wyżynki\", \"obrzynki\", \"wieniec\", \"wieńcowe\", \"żniwniok\" or \"okrężne\" are also used in some areas.\n\nSimilarly, in Belarus there are a variety of names in use, including the Feast of the Most Clean One (), Aspazha (), Haspazha (), Great Spazha (), Zelnya (), Talaka () and Dazhynki (). In Belarusian culture it is often associated and intermixed with the feasts of the Assumption of Mary (often dubbed the feast of the Mother of God of the Herbs in both Polish and Belarusian), hence the names of Green Feast () and Dormition () are also used.\n\nAs with many other Slavic feasts and rites, the origins of Slavic harvest festivals are unclear, in large part due to lack of historical documents from pre-Christian times. It is certain however, that both Western and Eastern Slavs formed mostly agricultural cultures and worshipped deities associated with working the land and passage of seasons. For instance every year at the end of the harvest the West Slavic tribe of Rani would gather around the temple in Arkona. Among the offerings to the god Svetovid was a large, human-sized pancake made of newly threshed grain from that years' harvest. If the pancake was large enough for the priest to hide behind it, the Slavs believed next year's harvest would be equally rich. Apparently a wreath made of the last straws left on the field at the end of the harvest was also believed to possess magical powers.\n\nThe wreath is a central feature of most celebrations associated with \"dożynki\", as it symbolises a rich harvest, the prospect of wealth and the power of new life vested in the grain gathered during the Summer. The latter probably explains why in many regions the grain from the wreath is used as the first batch of grain threshed and set aside for next year's sowing (for instance this practice is common in the Holy Cross Mountains of Central Poland).\n\nOriginally the wreath was in fact a decorated sheaf of grain, decorated with field flowers, ribbons and braided straws. In fact such wreaths were still being made in Poland in the 1930s. However, with time other forms of wreath became more popular, including the now-typical round wreath, but crown-shaped, oval or rectangular wreaths are also popular in various regions.\n\nThe sheaf or the wreath is usually brought back into the village by a ceremonial procession. It is often blessed, either by a Christian priest, or in an extra-religious way. For instance in Masovia the wreath is usually brought to the church for the Catholic priest to bless it with holy water. In other regions however it is the priest (Catholic, Orthodox or Greek Catholic) who is brought to the site where the final celebrations take place.\nOriginally the pre-Christian rite was performed on the autumn equinox (23 September). With time the rite became more closely associated with the actual end of fieldwork in the particular region. However, the time between the end of harvest and the festivities varies from area to area. For instance, in the vicinity of Kielce in central Poland and Kraków in southern Poland the wreath was traditionally blessed already on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August); it was then stored for a night or two in the house of the elder and the manor, before being threshed and the grain immediately sowed in the fields.\n\nIt is the ethnolinguistic phenomenon in the history the day of the and the completion of the harvest ritual, falling in many places August 15 (28), in other places celebrated in September. By mid-August harvest grain ends, hence the name of the holiday. Includes the rituals associated with last (dozhinochnym) sheaf, the ritual of \"curling beard\" and a celebratory meal.\n\nAlmost lost in Russia at the Soviet period. In the post-Soviet period this folk tradition in some countries has been recreated as an official holiday.\n\nHarvest Festival in Poland has been celebrated after the harvest since the time of the feudal systems. In present-day Poland the \"Presidential Harvest Festival\" was created in 1929.\n\n\n\n"}

In 2018, the State Fair was held from August 24 through September 3, and an admission fee was charged.\n\nThe DuQuoin Fair was organized in 1923 by William R. \"W.R.\" Hayes and a consortium of Du Quoin developers. They promoted the private-sector enterprise as a short-duration race meeting specializing in harness racing. Starting with a half-mile track, the developer eventually built the mile-long DuQuoin State Fairgrounds Racetrack on the fairgrounds. The racetrack hosted the Hambletonian trotting event in 1957-1980 and the \"World Trotting Derby\" in 1981-2009.

Directed by Bob Moss, it received mixed reviews and ran through October 7th. The BTG production first ran at The Unicorn Theatre in Stockbridge, Massachusetts in June and July 2016.\n\nThe story follows the life of Fiorello H. La Guardia during World War I and ten years later. As Mayor of New York City La Guardia reforms city politics by helping end Tammany Hall's vaunted political machine.\n\n\nMayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia is reading the comics over the radio because there is a newspaper strike. As he does so, the time changes to 1915 and the law office where clients are eagerly waiting to speak to LaGuardia. His law clerks assure the crowd that he will help one and all, regardless of their ability to pay (\"On the Side of the Angels\"). Fiorello's secretary Marie and her friend Dora discuss a crisis. Thea Almerigatti, the leader of the women shirtwaist strikers, has been arrested. LaGuardia promises to help the strikers. As the district leader Ben and his political buddies play poker (\"Politics and Poker\"), Marie introduces LaGuardia as a potential Congressional candidate. They want to beat the corrupt machine of Tammany Hall. \n\nWhile helping the women strikers, Fiorello asks Marie to dinner, but Thea, newly released from prison, arrives. She asks Fiorello to dinner to plan strategy, and he breaks his date with Marie. Marie feels foolish for caring while he cares so little (\"Marie's Law\"). \n\nNext year Fiorello is campaigning for Congress, and Thea introduces him. Fiorello promises to break the stranglehold of Tammany Hall (\"The Name's LaGuardia!\"). LaGuardia wins the election (\"The Bum Won\"). In another year, LaGuardia enlists in the Air Force and proposes to Thea. He and Marie say their farewells as he is about to leave for the war (\"Till Tomorrow\"). LaGuardia's participation in the war is presented as a series of montages, staged and on film. With the war over, Fiorello returns home (\"Home Again\"), with both Marie and Thea waiting for him. He goes to Thea, who has agreed to marriage. Morris, the office manager, comforts Marie.\n\n\nIn 1929 LaGuardia runs for mayor of New York, after he and Thea are married. Thea, home from a visit to the doctor, exclaims her love (\"When Did I Fall In Love\"). At Dora and her husband Floyd's (who has retired from the police force) home, the corrupt backers of Jimmy Walker, Fiorello's competitor for mayor, meet. As one of the gang wants to have Fiorello killed at his public speech, Dora rushes to secretly warn Marie. However, Fiorello's campaign is in turmoil, with Ben being fired and his worry over Thea's deteriorating health. At LaGuardia's speech the gang's plan to kill him is foiled. But Thea dies, and Marie, Morris, and Neil have to tell Fiorello. The race for mayor is won by Jimmy Walker. Fiorello is inspired by tragedy to continue his campaign.\n\nIn 1933 Ben and his political friends are again playing poker (\"Little Tin Box\"). Marie arrives and announces that she is quitting her job and will marry \"The Very Next Man\" who asks her. She convinces Ben to return to Fiorello to help him win the upcoming mayoral election. She then helps Fiorello to overcome his fears of losing and run again. He runs with Ben's help, and also asks Marie to marry him. She accepts and Fiorello finally becomes the mayor.\n\nThe musical contains several songs built around a group of machine politicians. In \"Politics and Poker\", Republican machine politicians try to pick a congressional candidate in a district they consider hopeless, while playing a game of poker, and compare politics to poker. The lyric is set to waltz tempo \"to underscore the frivolity of their cynicism.\" In \"The Bum Won\", these same politicians commiserate with one another after LaGuardia has won the election without their support. In \"Little Tin Box\", they imagine a series of Tammany politicians attempting to explain to a judge that their wealth came from their scrupulous habits of saving (\"I can see Your Honor doesn't pull his punches/ And it looks a trifle fishy, I'll admit,/ But for one whole week I went without my lunches/ And it mounted up, Your Honor, bit by bit./ Up Your Honor, bit by bit.\") \n\nIn \"I Love a Cop\", woman factory worker describes her hapless situation of having fallen in love with a policeman who was called out against a strike by her union;\n\"The Name's La Guardia\" has LaGuardia campaigning in English, Italian and Yiddish. There is also a ragtime number, \"Gentleman Jimmy\" about \"bon vivant\" mayor James J. \"Jimmy\" Walker, and the comic \"Marie's Law\", in which Marie proposes a \"law\" about how husbands should treat their wives. (\"Every girl shall have a honeymoon, which will last at least a year,/ During which aforesaid honeymoon, every care shall disappear…\".)\n\nBesides the invention of some peripheral characters, the musical changes some basic facts of LaGuardia's life. LaGuardia's first wife, Thea, died after only three years of marriage, but the fictional Thea lives another eight years, so that her death can be one more calamity during LaGuardia's unsuccessful 1929 mayoral campaign; also, the script downplays LaGuardia's generally successful congressional career to make him seem more of an outsider and increase the triumph of his eventual mayoral victory in 1933.\n\n\nAn additional song, \"Where Do I Go from Here?\" (originally written for Marie to sing in Act I) was cut out of town; it can be heard on the Liz Callaway album \"Lost in Boston\" (Varese Sarabande VSD-5475). \"Till Tomorrow\" and \"Unfair\" were written \"on spec\" before Bock and Harnick were hired for the show. \"Little Tin Box\" was added on the road in Philadelphia.\n\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", Brooks Atkinson wrote: \"...It is exciting; it is enjoyable and it is decent ... Jerry Bock has set ... a bouncy score ... [A]s the writer of lyrics, Sheldon Harnick is in an unfailingly humorous frame of mind ... [U]nder Mr. Abbott's invincible stage direction, the whole show comes alive with gusto ... [T]he cast could not be more winning or in better voice.\"\n\nLouis Calta wrote: \" 'Fiorello!' is the town's latest stage hit ... the attraction earned flowery praise from all of the New York drama critics.\"\n\nThe original cast recording of \"Fiorello!\" was made by Capitol Records on November 29, 1959, just six days after the show opened, and was released on December 14. The album debuted on \"Billboard's\" best-selling albums chart January 11, 1960, peaked at #7 and remained on the charts for 89 weeks. It has been reissued on CD twice, first by Capitol and then later in a much improved release on EMI's Broadway Angel label (CD #ZDM 7 65023-2).\n\nOn the television show \"Mad Men\", Don Draper and his wife Betty attend a showing of \"Fiorello!\" in the season one episode \"Shoot\".\n\n"}

{"id": "16884579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16884579", "title": "Got Talent", "text": "Got Talent\n\nGot Talent is a British talent show television format conceived and owned by Simon Cowell's SYCOtv company. It has spawned spin-offs in over 58 countries (as of April 2014), in what is now referred to as the 'Got Talent' format, similar to that described by FremantleMedia of the \"Idol\" and \"The X Factor\" formats. Unlike those shows, \"Got Talent\" showcases several artistic disciplines in addition to singing. In April 2014, the format was named the world's most successful reality TV format ever by the Guinness World Records.\n\n\"Got Talent\" was an invention by \"The X Factor\" creator Simon Cowell, with comedian and talk show host Paul O'Grady producing a pilot for ITV in 2005 under the provisional title \"Paul O'Grady's Got Talent\". O'Grady left the network after disputes with ITV, resulting in Cowell moving the concept to the United States while he and ITV searched for a new show host.\n\nOwing to these issues, the \"Got Talent\" franchise ended up debuting first as \"America's Got Talent\" on NBC on 21 June 2006, with judges David Hasselhoff, Brandy Norwood, and Piers Morgan. The show's original series was hosted by Regis Philbin. In 2016, the judging panel consisted of Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, Melanie Brown, and Simon Cowell, and hosted by Nick Cannon, who was the presenter from 2009-2016. From season 12 (2017), the new host of AGT is Tyra Banks. The grand prize for the winner(s) is US$1 million, and, since season 3, a chance to headline a show on the Las Vegas Strip. \"America's Got Talent\" proved extremely successful for NBC, pulling in high ratings in both total viewers and the younger 18-49 demographic. The show's initial success in America is credited with the eventual launch of the British series, and the overall global launch of the \"Got Talent\" franchise.\n\nITV eventually debuted \"Britain's Got Talent\" on 9 June 2007 with Cowell, Morgan and Amanda Holden as judges, and Ant & Dec as hosts of the show. For series 5, Morgan stepped down due to commitments hosting \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" on CNN, and Cowell only attended the live shows as he was busy launching \"The X Factor USA\", so Michael McIntyre and David Hasselhoff joined the panel with Holden. In October 2011, it was confirmed that McIntyre and Hasselhoff would not return for series 6 and they were replaced by David Walliams and Alesha Dixon, along with Cowell returning as a judge full-time. The top prize is £250,000 (£100,000 in series 1–5 and £500,000 in series 6) and a performance at the Royal Variety Show in front of the British Royal Family.\n\nIn June 2010, following \"Britain's Got Talent\"'s success at the BAFTA television awards, Cowell voiced his ideas regarding \"World's Got Talent\", a global version of \"Got Talent\". However, he argued that the format would not work with judges as they had all \"tried to be him\" in previous attempts (such as \"World Idol\"), and instead proposed a commentary format, similar to that of the Eurovision Song Contest. During the same week, more details were announced, with Cowell explaining 20 previous winning contestants from global variations of \"Got Talent\" would be brought together at the Royal Albert Hall with himself and Jonathan Lopez both having roles in the show. A proposed prize of £1 million was announced, along with a projected global television audience of 300 million, and an intended airdate of 2011.\n\nHowever, Cowell halted plans for the series because it would conflict with his judging commitments with \"The X Factor USA\" and \"Britain's Got Talent\" for the years to come. In February 2014, \"The X Factor USA\" was cancelled by Fox due to low ratings and Cowell's decision to return to the UK version of that show. There is a global version of \"Got Talent\", entitled \"Planet's Got Talent\". It can be found on YouTube, showing acts from most of the internationally spread \"Got Talent\" series.\n\nThe American version will launch a spin-off series, \"\", in 2019 featuring notable contestants from \"America's Got Talent\" alongside acts from the franchises worldwide.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, ITV had broadcast a series of spin-off shows 'Planet's Got Talent' which showed the clips of Got Talent from all over the world. It has been broadcast in Italy on TV8 and Sky Uno. Then Slovenia had made a show as same as the British one.\n"}

No less of a talent in the world of musical composition, Bernard Herrmann was a child prodigy who had worked with Orson Welles before finding a collaboration with Hitchcock on \"The Trouble with Harry\", \"\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\"\", \"The Wrong Man\", \"North by Northwest\", \"Vertigo\", \"\"Psycho\"\", \"The Birds\" and \"Marnie\". After ten years the two men ended their collaboration.\n\nThrough what is two intersecting monologues the play \"Hitchcock & Herrmann\" explores the relationship between these two geniuses and endeavours to explain in their own words why at the height of their creative talents they parted company and never worked together again. Interspersed throughout are examples of Herrmann's music - often taking the place for important dramatic points.\n\nThe play was first performed in January, 2005 as a rehearsed reading at the 4MBS Performance Studio in Brisbane, Australia with Knijnenburg himself playing the part of Hitchcock and Yalin Ozucelik as Bernard Herrmann. This reading was somewhat of a rushed affair in order to accommodate Ozuceik who was soon to begin studies at NIDA and would subsequently be unavailable.\n\nNevertheless, the show was a success, resulting in a three-week performance season in March 2005. Knijnenburg again played Hitchcock, however this time the role of Bernard Herrmann was taken by Michael Priest.\nFurther successes followed culminating in a nomination for Best Playwright in the 2005 Matilda Awards for Excellence in Live Drama. Other nominees in the category included world-famous playwright David Williamson.\n\nIn 2006 Knijnenburg was invited to perform the show at the Melbourne Fringe Festival. With Michael Priest unavailable a new actor was cast in the role of Bernard Herrmann - Jesse Rosenfeld, a young actor who had recently graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts but had been acting since the age of twelve when he appeared in Bruce Beresford's film \"Paradise Road\" alongside Pamela Rabe, Pauline Collins, Glenn Close and Cate Blanchett.\n\nPlans are afoot to tour the production throughout Australia and internationally with the only problems being to fit in with Knijnenburg's and Rosenfeld's acting schedules - Knijnenburg is performing in the theatre and Rosenfeld has joined the cast of the revamped television series \"Neighbours\".\n\n"}

It was hosted by Dr. James Thompson, an honorary UCL senior lecturer in psychology. The existence of the conference, as well as the names of some of the attendees, was revealed by the \"London Student\" on January 10, 2018.

However, that vote was annulled as being unconstitutional since it had not been held in a secret vote. On 16 March, parliament elected Nicolae Timofti as president by 62 votes out of 101, with the PCRM boycotting the election, putting an end to a political crisis that had lasted since April 2009.\n\nAfter the parliamentary election held on 5 April 2009, the PCRM won 49.48% of the vote and 60 seats, one seat too few to elect a President.

On the same day, Ghimpu signed a decree nominating Vlad Filat for the office of prime minister.\n\nThe Commission for constitutional reform in Moldova was set up under presidential decree on 1 December in order to resolve the constitutional crisis. The post of Acting President passed later to Marian Lupu, who held it since 30 December 2010.\n\nFollowing an interrogation submitted by four deputies of the PCRM, Moldova's Constitutional Court ruled on 8 February 2011 that the parliament is the only institution which can decide when to hold a new presidential election, since the two-month deadline after the end of the mandate of the previous president, as foreseen by the constitution as having expired.\n\nOn 20 October 2011 the Moldovan parliament decided to hold a presidential election on 18 November 2011.\n\nOn 4 November 2011, Igor Dodon announced that he would quit the Party of Communists along with MPs Zinaida Greceanii and Veronica Abramciuc. Dodon said that the three of them would vote for a president who was independent from any party, alliance or other political body. They did so due to the PCRM's to boycott the election, thus making it virtually possible to break the impasse by reaching an agreement with the majority coalition that lacks two votes to pass the election threshold.\n\nNevertheless, on 15 November the deadline for candidates' applications expired with no applications provided. The country's laws do not make provision for a situation where there are no presidential candidates, but the elections are likely to be postponed or cancelled.\nUnder Moldovan law, the presidential election can be repeated only once. If the second attempt fails, the country must hold early parliamentary elections.\n\nFollowing two failed rounds to elect a president, the AEI had two candidates: Veronica Bacalu, the former Deputy Governor of the National Bank of Moldova, who is working at the World Bank and was nominated by the Liberal Democrat Party; and Ion Ababii, the former Minister of Health who was nominated by the Democratic Party. In the end, the head of the Supreme Magistrate Council Judge Nicolae Timofti became the compromise candidate. He said that he would maintain \"strategic ties\" with the United States, Russia and Germany, as well as worth towards settling the dispute of Transnistria; and he added that \"Moldova must become a bridge between East and West from which it can only win.\"\n\nFollowing successive failures to elect a president, the country had an acting president for over 900 days. A 60% vote was required to approve a president.\n\nAccording to Article 80 of the constitution: \"The President of Moldova takes office on the oath-taking day and his term has a duration of 4 years.\"\n\nOn 2 December, an attempt was set for 16 December to try to get candidates for the election. At the same time, an electoral law revision was passed that asserted an election will only be held if there are any candidates and only if at least 61 MPs are present at the vote. Should the election again be unsuccessful, an early parliamentary election would have to be held (which would be the third such election after 2009 and 2010).\n\nThe three PCRM MPs who defected attended the vote (with the other PCRM MPs boycotting again), but voted against Marian Lupu, who was the only candidate. Another attempt was set for 15 January 2012. However, Lupu announced he would not run in the election, and stated that the governing parties were prepared to nominate a compromise candidate.\n\nIn December 2011, the Sierra Leone-born John Onoje signed up to run for president. On 9 December, Onoje passed the medical examination in order to run for president. Onoje's campaign was so well publicised that the PSRM's Victor Șelin proposed revoking his Moldovan citizenship on this basis.\n\nOn 11 January, Oazu Nantoi told the press that he would run as a candidate and that he had discussed this prospect with Vlad Filat and other leaders of the Alliance for European Integration: \"Their reaction was moderately positive. I remain an optimist and I hope that I will secure the parliamentary deputies' support and go ahead with my self-nomination.\" The same day, the PCRM had proposed the former chairman of the National Bank of Moldova Leonid Tălmaci as a compromise candidate. The two candidates then registered with the head of the election commission to run for the post of president.\n\nOn 12 January, the Constitutional Court of Moldova annulled the inconclusive December election because some members of parliament violated the law by showing how they marked their ballots on television.\n\nA new constitutional referendum was announced to be planned for April, with the presidential election to be held afterwards. On 15 January, the leaders of AEI made a joint statement announcing that a constitutional referendum would be held in April. Prime Minister Vlad Filat said that \"a referendum on the amendment of the constitution will be initiated in order to give people the opportunity to rectify the constitutional deficiencies that have been triggering endless political crises.\" Acting President Marian Lupu added that: \"Moldova's president will be elected within a month after the validation of the referendum's outcome.\" Liberal leader Mihai Ghimpu then said that the amendment to the constitution is the only solution to the political crisis. The leaders of AEI then withdrew their proposal for the referendum during a special address on \"Moldova 1\" on 10 February. It added that a date for a new presidential vote would be announced on 16 February at the opening of the parliamentary session.\n\nOn 13 March, Nicolae Timofti and MP Mihai Godea, the leader of the Democratic Action Party talked about the expected election and what would make Godea agree to vote for him. Two days later Godea announced his support for Timofti. At the end of a meeting with Timofti on 14 March, Igor Dodon had not decided whether to back him.\n\nFollowing meetings between the Alliance for European Integration and the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova, another election attempt was set for 16 March after parliament affirmed the date 9 days earlier, though PCRM boycotted the vote on the premise that the incumbent parliament is illegitimate, amidst their demand it be dissolved. Three PCRM rebels, who called themselves \"socialists,\" and led by Igor Dodon suggested they would back Timofti. Dodon said: \"The election of a president is better than an aggressive campaign for new parliamentary elections which will not solve the political crisis. We must put an end to the crisis and get down to work for the good of the country. That is how an opposition should act and not choose to stage marches and street demonstrations.\" Timofti said: \"The European orientation of Moldova must be a priority. This has been the policy of Moldova in recent years and this is the policy that must continue\" and that \"I am convinced that Moldova has no other future than a European future.\" The vote was brought forward from the afternoon to the morning. PCRM also threatened to disrupt the vote. PCRM supporters protested the election, but former president Vladimir Voronin later said that the party had called for a suspension to the protests.\n\nTimofti was elected with the support of AEI, three former PCRM deputies who had defected to PSRM and Mihai Godea. The head of the election commission, Tudor Deliu, announced the result saying that \"after 917 days, the epic of electing a president is over.\" Addressing reporters after the Constitutional Court of Moldova confirmed him as head of state on 19 March, Timofti said that his inauguration would likely take place on 23 March. According to article 79 of the constitution, he must be sworn in as president within 45 days.\n\n! style=\"text-align:center; background:#e9e9e9; vertical-align:top;\"|Candidate\n! style=\"background:#e9e9e9; text-align:center;\"|Party\n! style=\"background:#e9e9e9; text-align:center;\"|Votes\n\nUpon being elected, Timofti called for the removal of all Russian peacekeeping troops from Transnistria and said that he advocates a peaceful solution to the Transnistrian conflict through negotiations with the 5+2 format (Russia, Ukraine, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union and the U.S. He also called for reforms and upholding the \"rule of law\" adding that in his role as president and thus \"guarantor of the constitution\" he would \"supervise how the principle of separation of powers in the state is observed as this is a fundamental, democratic principle without which we cannot speak about veritable rule of law. They now speak a lot about the imperfection of the constitution and the necessity of amending it...I will provide all the support for improving the constitutional framework so that there are no blockages in the future and the supreme law ensures the efficient and harmonious development of the country.\" He was also congratulated by parliament.\n\nThe AEI also expressed regret over the PCRM's boycott with PM Vlad Filat saying the coalition has sought to \"establish a civilised dialogue with the opposition Communists, but they refused to contribute to the efforts of the government. I wish I would have had half of the possibilities that the opposition has now, when I was in opposition. Once the president is elected, the political establishment will have to cope with the hardest burden – we should have a united society at the next parliamentary election, without the barricades that the Communists have built now.\" However, PCRM MP Sergiu Sîrbu said the boycott will continue and that \"something serious should happen for us to return to parliament, like the resignation of the president or of the government.\" He also added that a new law that would suspend salaries to those MPs who are absent from sittings of parliament or of parliamentary commissions without reason would not deter the boycott as \"it will be a serious blow, but democracy and the fight for justice [would continue].\"\n\n"}

His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when the comment was republished in the United States five months later. The full quotation was: \n\nThe statement originates from an interview conducted by journalist Maureen Cleave, who included it in a March 1966 article for the London newspaper the \"Evening Standard\", which drew no public reaction at the time. When \"Datebook\", a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests broke out in the United States, particularly throughout the Bible Belt. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's US tour in August 1966, and Lennon and Brian Epstein attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nShortly after the controversy broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying \"if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it\". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. The events contributed to the Beatles' lack of interest in public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.\n\nIn March 1966, London's \"Evening Standard\" ran a weekly series of articles titled \"How Does a Beatle Live?\" that featured, in chronological order, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, George Harrison and Paul McCartney. The articles were written by journalist Maureen Cleave, who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of Beatlemania in the UK. Three years previously she had described them as \"the darlings of Merseyside\", and had accompanied them on the plane on the group's first US tour in February 1964. For her lifestyle series in March 1966, she chose to interview the group individually, rather than all together, as was the norm.\nCleave interviewed Lennon on 4 March 1966. At his home, Kenwood, in Weybridge, she found a full-size crucifix, a gorilla costume, a medieval suit of armour and a well-organised library, with works by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley, and \"The Passover Plot\" by Hugh J. Schonfield, which had influenced Lennon's ideas about Christianity. Cleave's article mentioned that Lennon was \"reading extensively about religion\", and quoted a comment he made:\n\nCleave's interview with Lennon was published in the \"Evening Standard\" in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK. Church attendance there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times. Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, \"The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me \"Dick\" ...').\" In 1963, the Anglican Bishop of Woolwich, John A.T. Robinson, published a controversial but popular book, \"Honest to God\", urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on morality and the concept of God as an \"old man in the sky\", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love. Bryan R. Wilson's 1966 text \"Religion in Secular Society\" explained that increasing secularisation led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.\n\nBoth McCartney and Harrison had been baptised in the Roman Catholic Church, but neither of them followed Christianity. At the start of Beatlemania, the group came into contact with the Revd Ronald Gibbons, who told reporters that a Beatles version of \"O Come, All Ye Faithful\" might provide the Church of England with \"the very shot in the arm it needs\".\n\nThe day after Cleave's article appeared in the \"Evening Standard\", Beatles press officer Tony Barrow offered \"Datebook\", a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple pop music and producing more intellectually challenging work. As \"Datebook\" was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalisation of marijuana, it seemed like a suitable vehicle to carry this information.\n\nLennon's quote was featured in a 3 July article in \"The New York Times Magazine\" and provoked no reaction. In late July, when \"Datebook\" republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote \"I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity!\" on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: \"It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!\" In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, \"That does it for me. I am not going to play the Beatles any more\". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, \"We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing\". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in \"The New York Times\" on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.\n\nEpstein was so concerned by the reaction that he considered cancelling the group's upcoming US tour, believing they would be seriously harmed in some way. He then flew to the US and held a press conference in New York City, where he publicly criticised \"Datebook\", saying the magazine had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that \"people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way\". Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In Mexico City there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including South Africa and Spain, made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations. The Vatican issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.\n\nThe Beatles left for their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, he was nervous and upset that he had made people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles attended a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that \"if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it\" but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, \"not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us.\" Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: \"if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry.\" Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were \"quite notorious for their Christian attitude\".\n\nWhen the tour began, it was marred by protests and disturbances. Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the Ku Klux Klan. \"Daily Express\" writer Robert Pitman, responding to the US outcry, wrote, \"It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens.\" The reaction was also criticised in the US; a Kentucky radio station announced that it would give the Beatles' music airplay to show its \"contempt for hypocrisy personified\", and the Jesuit magazine \"America\" wrote: \"Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit\".\n\nThe Memphis city council, aware that a Beatles concert was scheduled at the Mid-South Coliseum during the tour, voted to cancel it rather than have \"municipal facilities be used as a forum to ridicule anyone's religion\", and also saying, \"the Beatles are not welcome in Memphis\". The Ku Klux Klan nailed a Beatles album to a wooden cross, vowing \"vengeance\", with conservative groups staging further public burnings of Beatles records. The Reverend Jimmy Stroad stated that a Christian rally in Memphis \"would give the youth of the mid-South an opportunity to show Jesus Christ is more popular than the Beatles\". The Memphis shows did take place, on 19 August; the afternoon show went as planned, but there was a minor panic when a firecracker was set off on stage during the evening performance, which led the group to believe they were the target of gunfire.\n\nThe Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction from Lennon's comments, and were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work. The controversy had also overshadowed the US release of their 1966 album \"Revolver\", which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical statement up to that point. Following the tour, Harrison seriously contemplated leaving the group, but was persuaded to stay on the condition that the Beatles would from now on focus solely on their work as recording artists. After a break, they reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", which was a major critical and commercial success when released in June 1967. \n\nLennon was asked about the controversy during a trip to Canada in 1969. He repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the protestors in the US \"fascist Christians\", saying he was \"very big on Christ. I've always fancied him. He was right.\" In 1978, he thanked Jesus for an end to the Beatles' touring, saying \"if I hadn't said [that] and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan, well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus.\"\n\nIn 1993, Michael Medved wrote in \"The Sunday Times\" that \"today, comments like Lennon's could never cause controversy; a contemptuous attitude to religion is all but expected from all mainstream pop performers.\" In 1997, Noel Gallagher claimed that his band Oasis was \"bigger than God\", but reaction was minimal.\n\nIn a 2008 article marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' double album \"The Beatles\" (also known as the \"White Album\"), the Vatican newspaper, \"L'Osservatore Romano\", issued the statement:\n\nIn response to the statement, Starr said \"Didn't the Vatican say we were possibly Satanic, and they've still forgiven us? I think the Vatican's got more to talk about than the Beatles.\" In its 14 April 2010 edition, \"L'Osservatore Romano\" responded to Starr's comments, stating that \"John Lennon had no need of forgiveness from the Vatican, \"L'Osservatore Romano\" reprinted its 1966 article on John Lennon's comments. The 1966 \"L'Osservatore Romano\" article noted that Lennon had apologised for his comments and that fellow Beatle Paul McCartney had criticized them.\" In 2010, Starr said that he had now found religion, adding, \"For me, God is in my life ... I think the search has been on since the 1960s.\"\n\nIn 2012, the \"Houston Press\" music blog compared several aspects of popular media and concluded that Jesus is more popular than the Beatles. In 2015, \"The Philippine Star\" said that almost half a century later, Lennon's statement proved half-wrong, reporting that \"rock 'n roll is dead but Christianity expanded with Catholicism experiencing exceptional growth through Pope Francis' lead\".\n\nOn 18 May 1968, Lennon summoned the other Beatles to a meeting at Apple Corps to announce that he was the living reincarnation of Jesus: \"I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again.\" The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\", with Lennon singing the lines, \"Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me.\" In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself \"One of Christ's biggest fans\", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.\n\nOn 3 December 1969, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice asked Lennon to play the part of Jesus in the stage production of \"Jesus Christ Superstar\", which he declined, although he said he would have been interested if Ono could play the part of Mary Magdalene. Lennon mentioned Jesus again in his 1970 song \"God\", singing, \"I don't believe in Jesus\", but also sang that he did not believe in the Bible, Buddha, the \"Gita\", and the Beatles. Critics of Lennon's lyrics have also focused on the line \"Imagine there's no heaven\" from his 1971 song \"Imagine\".\n\nLennon was murdered on 8 December 1980 by Mark David Chapman, who had become a born-again Christian in 1970 and was incensed by Lennon's \"more popular than Jesus\" remark, calling it blasphemy. He later stated that he was further enraged by the songs \"God\" and \"Imagine\", even singing the latter with the altered lyric: \"Imagine John Lennon dead\".\n\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\nSources\n"}

He participated in the 'Great Escape' from Stalag Luft III in March 1944 but was one of the men recaptured and subsequently murdered by the \"Gestapo\".\n\nMcGarr was born in Johannesburg, South Africa and moved with his family to Durban, in 1923. He began his education there but suffered with polio and was paralyzed from the waist down at the age of twelve. McGarr did not give up and working constantly he managed to recover the use of his legs and by September 1930 was able to start high school, he was educated at Glenwood High School (South Africa) from 1932 to 1935 and before graduating he had earned a series of awards for sports and academic achievement and was a member of the first XV Rugby team for his school. He commenced work in the laboratories of Lever Brothers before moving to the Treasury Department of Durban Corporation. His hobbies involved his Rudge Special motorcycle and his BSA Scout sports car although he did complete a tour of duty with the naval reserve.\n\nAfter war broke out McGarr and two friends enlisted in the South African Air Force to train as pilots in May 1940. On 23 May 1940 his service commenced and on 26 April 1941 he was commissioned as second lieutenant having been presented with his pilot's brevet. He was posted to Egypt on 21 July 1941 and in October 1941 joined No. 2 Squadron SAAF flying Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk fighters over the Libya-Egypt frontier.\nOn 6 October 1941 flying with his squadron on a patrol in the Sidi Omar vicinity they were intercepted by a formation of Luftwaffe Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters of II Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 27 and two P-40 Tomahawks were shot down by Gustav Roedel and Otto Schulz. McGarr baled out, his wing mate was killed in action. He landed and set off on foot with only one shoe, the other having been lost. After three days walking through the desert without food or water he was captured by soldiers of the Afrika Korps and after only a few days in a prison camp in Libya was sent to Germany where he was held at Stalag Luft I Barth before being transferred to Stalag Luft III where he was an immediate volunteer for tunneling although his physical size made him unsuitable and he was asked to supervise the security teams maintaining a watch against German checks which might otherwise discover the tunnels.\nMcGarr was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944, in the escape now famous as \"the Great Escape\". When the Germans discovered the escape they began extensive well planned manhunts.\n\nNeville McGarr was briefly trapped in the tunnel due to his stature but was freed and escaped into the woods although on the afternoon of 27 March 1944 after surviving the freezing temperatures and blizzards he was recaptured with George McGill and taken to the civil prison at Zagan. He was one of 19 men now recaptured and held there until moved to Görlitz prison where he was in a cell with Keith Ogilvie, Paul Royle and Chaz Hall. Early on the morning of 6 April 1944 Tony Bethell heard a truck arrive at the prison and heard six names being called out, Denys Street, Neville McGarr, Jack Grisman, Sandy Gunn, Harold Milford and John F Williams were taken away.\n\nHe was one of the 50 escapers executed and murdered by the \"Gestapo\". Originally cremated at Breslau by the Gestapo and buried at Sagan, he is now buried in part of the Poznan Old Garrison Cemetery.\n\nMcGarr is recorded on the official list published by the Royal Canadian Air Force\nHis name was amongst the 47 murdered officers named in the British press when the story became public knowledge on or about 20 May 1944\n\nHis conspicuous bravery was recognized by a Mention in Despatches as none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously. It was published in a supplement to the \"London Gazette\" on 8 June 1944.\n\nThe Gestapo executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape.\n\nPost-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.\n\n\n"}

These are often held at schools and universities to attract prospective students, familiarize them (and their parents) with the facilities, allow new students to become familiar with facilities and meet others, or to open informal communication channels between school staff and the students and their parents.\n\nSchool open houses are about two hours long, the length of a good movie or show . . . a well-executed event sets the stage for a successful school year. The face-to-face meetings with families help build relationships, increase the visibility of the parent group, and develop a sense of community at school.\nContrary to what its name might seem to imply, an open house at the average school is not intended for general members of the public, but rather, specifically, for the parents and family members of the students who either attend or are considering attending a school. In the overwhelming majority of schools in the United States, open house is held once a year, typically in the first month or first quarter of the school year. It is common for open houses to be held in the evenings or weekends, to allow for parents who work during the standard the work-week hours to attend, but holding open house in the daytime is not unusual, especially at elementary schools.\n\nIn elementary schools, open houses often have no schedule; parents come and go during the scheduled hours as they please, and some teachers may be willing to discuss individual students' progress with their parents. Some schools may schedule displays of school activities, such as a performance by a student choir.\n\nIn secondary schools—divided into middle schools (also called junior high schools) and high schools (also called senior high schools)—the single most important purpose of the open house is to allow parents and teachers meet each other face-to-face. In many middle schools and high schools, parents are given a schedule, often the same schedule their child follows during the school day. The parents go from one class to another, in the sequence that their child attends them, usually in the very same classrooms. Typically in such open houses the parents have only 5–15 minutes with their child's teacher, which provides time for the teacher to explain their class expectations, but not enough time to discuss individual children.\n\n\nFor examples of open houses as informative events, see the following:\n"}

As a result, Peaches is now linked to the Long Island serial killer as a potential victim.\n\nOn June 28, 1997, a dismembered body was discovered by a hiker in a wooded area of Hempstead Lake State Park, Lakeview, New York. The head, both arms and legs below the knee were severed and have yet to be found. The torso was found on the west side of Lake Drive, about two-hundred yards north of Peninsula Boulevard. She was found in a Rubbermaid container along with a red towel and a floral pillowcase. With no leads to the woman's identity, the police published a picture of the approximately two-inch wide tattoo in a national tattoo magazine, in the hopes of finding the artist who did the work. They received a call from Steve Cullen, a tattoo artist in Connecticut who claimed he remembered giving the tattoo to a woman. Cullen said he remembered the customer as a young black woman, about 18 or 19 years old, who was accompanied by two women, an aunt and a cousin. During the session, he also claimed she told him she was from either the Bronx or Long Island and that she was in Connecticut because she was having trouble with her boyfriend at the time. It is possible the woman had other tattoos on her arms or lower legs that the killer did not want found.\n\nOn December 13, 2016, Long Island Press reported that local authorities have positively identified skeletal remains (formerly referred to as \"Jane Doe 3\") found at Jones Beach State Park in 2011 as belonging to Peaches. Remains of a child were also found in 2011, east of Cedar Beach, with DNA testing identifying Jane Doe 3--or \"Peaches\"—as its mother. As a result of these findings, Peaches has now been linked to the Long Island serial killer as a potential early victim.\n\nOn March 3, 2007 a dismembered torso was found in a suitcase in Harbor Island Park in Mamaroneck, Westchester County, New York. Investigators believe the victim was a heavy-set Hispanic or light-skinned African-American woman, about five feet seven inches tall, and one-hundred eighty to two-hundred pounds. She had a tattoo of two red cherries on a green stem located on her right breast. \"Cherries\" (as she is referred to by law enforcement) was also decapitated and dismembered, although her original cause of death was a stab wound to the torso. Unlike Peaches, investigators found both of Cherries' legs, which washed up on the shore of Cablevision owner James Dolan's beachfront estate in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York. Inside the suitcase investigators found a pair of gray Champion sweat pants, a tan or cream-colored long-sleeved shirt by Voice and a red camisole bearing Spanish-language labels. The dark blue or black suitcase is sold exclusively at Wal-Mart stores. Police also found small scraps of paper tucked away in the crevices of the suitcase. When pieced together, it looks like a calendar with the Spanish word \"cinco\" and the phrase \"begin to live.\" Police claim that since the torso floated onto the beach as storm-fed floods hit the region, it could have originated from almost anywhere.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "20301192", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20301192", "title": "Presupposition (philosophy)", "text": "Presupposition (philosophy)\n\nIn epistemology, a presupposition relates to a belief system, or Weltanschauung, that is required for the argument to make sense. A variety of Christian apologetics, called presuppositional apologetics, argues that the existence or non-existence of God is the basic presupposition of all human thought, and that all people arrive at a worldview which is ultimately determined by the theology they presuppose. Evidence and arguments are only developed after the fact in an attempt to justify the theological assumptions already made. According to this view, it is impossible to demonstrate the existence of God unless one presupposes that God exists, with the stance that modern science relies on methodological naturalism, a myth, and thus is incapable of discovering the supernatural. It thereby fashions a Procrustean bed which rejects any observation which would disprove the naturalistic assumption. Apologetics argue that the resulting worldview is inconsistent with itself and therefore irrational (for example, via the Argument from morality or via the Transcendental argument for the existence of God).\n\n"}
{"id": "34462308", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34462308", "title": "Pál Schmitt academic misconduct controversy", "text": "Pál Schmitt academic misconduct controversy\n\nThe Pál Schmitt academic misconduct scandal refers to allegations of plagiarism concerning the 1992 doctoral thesis and the circumstances of the doctoral defence of the President of Hungary Pál Schmitt, which led to Schmitt's resignation from his presidential post. The scandal broke in January 2012, when Hungarian news organizations published a number of articles claiming that about 197 pages of Schmitt's 215-page thesis had been lifted from works by other, foreign scholars, without giving appropriate credit.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, a Hungarian news portal, hvg.hu published an article which claimed that material that amounts to around 180 of the 215 pages of Pál Schmitt's 1992 doctoral (dr. univ.) thesis, titled \"Az újkori olimpiai játékok programjának elemzése\" (\"An analysis of the programme of the modern Olympics\"), had been lifted from a 1987 manuscript by Bulgarian sports researcher Nikolay Georgiev, together with a page's worth of material from a work by Hristo Meranzov and Georgiev. On 19 January, news organizations found that an additional 17 pages had been copied from a paper by German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann. The late Georgiev's daughter said she did not know of any cooperation between Schmitt and her father in the preparation of Georgiev's work. Heinemann denied any knowledge of Schmitt, and expressed his concerns about the plagiarism allegations.\n\nFurther concerns about a conflict of interest were raised when it was reported that multiple members of Schmitt's thesis committee had also been members of the Hungarian Olympic Academy and the Hungarian Olympic Committee, organizations both headed by Schmitt at the time his title was awarded.\n\nAfter the initial report, Schmitt denied the allegations, saying that no plagiarism took place, as he had listed Georgiev's work in the list of works cited. The President made no further comments, including any comments about the allegation regarding the Heinemann text, until a radio interview in which he shrugged off the claim, saying that it was natural for all such works to include a certain amount of common \"core material\". A number of scholars started a petition asking for a fair and transparent investigation of the allegations. Although they have PhD degrees,\nthe Hungarian National News Agency (MTI) referred to them as doctoral students.\n\nAfter a formal investigation, a five-member fact finding committee at Semmelweis University delivered a report on 27 March. The University Council advised the University Senate to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title. The University Senate withdrew Schmitt's title on 29 March. On 2 April, Schmitt announced to the Hungarian Parliament that he would resign as President.\n\nSchmitt was a successful fencer in his youth, winning two gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games. Later, he served as an ambassador during the 1990s, and he was a Member of the European Parliament with the Fidesz party from 2004 to 2010. After briefly serving as Speaker of the National Assembly of Hungary in 2010, Schmitt was elected as President of Hungary in a 263 to 59 vote in the Parliament of Hungary; he was sworn in as President on 2010.\n\nFrom 1983 to 1988 Schmitt was the general secretary of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, and in 1981–1990 he was undersecretary for sport. In 1990, after the end of Communism in Hungary, he became president of the Hungarian Olympic Committee, a post he held until 2010.\n\nFounded in 1769, Semmelweis University is the oldest medical school in Hungary, located in Budapest. Becoming an independent medical school after the Second World War it developed into a university teaching medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, health sciences, health management, and following the merger with the University of Physical Education, physical education and sport sciences. The university is named after Ignác Semmelweis.\n\nToday's Faculty of Physical Education and Sport Sciences at the Semmelweis University was founded in 1925 as a separate institution, Hungarian Royal Physical Education College. Between 1945 and 1989 it operated under the name of Hungarian College of Physical Education, and in 1989 it became the Hungarian University of Physical Education. In 2000 the previously independent university became part of the Semmelweis University as the Faculty of Sport Sciences.\n\nUntil 1993 the only doctoral title Hungarian universities could award was the \"doctor universitatis\", or dr. univ., title. It was not considered to be an academic degree. The so-called candidate's degree (C.Sc.) was the first post-graduate scientific degree, and it was issued by the Committee of Scientific Qualifications of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The requirements for the univ. dr. title were generally below the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) requirements, while those of the candidate's degree were above the PhD level. In 1993, the PhD degree was introduced in Hungary, and the universities had the jurisdiction to convert dr. univ. degrees to PhD doctorates on a case-by-case basis, if they met the necessary requirements. (The conversion of the candidate's titles had been automatic, on request.) Schmitt's degree wasn't converted, although his CV on the website of the EU Parliament states that he has a PhD. His CV on the IOC website also lists his title as \"doctor of philosophy.\"\n\nOn 11 January 2012, hvg.hu published an article claiming that most of Schmitt's 1992 thesis, 180 of the 215 pages, was almost a word-for-word translation of parts of Bulgarian sport scholar and diplomat Nikolay Georgiev's 465 pages long 1987 French-language manuscript \"Analyse du programme olympique (des Jeux d’Olympiade)\", and it also contained a page worth of material from the 1985 work \"Analysis of the Olympic Programme\" by Hristo Meranzov and Nikolay Georgiev. The site also published a 12-page PDF document containing excerpts from both Georgiev's manuscript and Schmitt's dissertation for comparison. Heti Világgazdaság remarked that Schmitt's dissertation did not contain in-body citations, only a bibliography listing 21 pieces of literature. In this bibliography the place of publication of Georgiev's manuscript was erroneously given as Bulgaria, instead of Lausanne, Switzerland, and the title of the work was given in Hungarian, although Georgiev's work has not been published in Hungary. The piece also reported that the dissertation contains a multitude of spelling mistakes, some mistranslations and erroneous statements that were present in Georgiev's manuscript. Though the reviewers of the dissertation, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács, had multiple issues regarding the dissertation, both of them gave the work \"summa cum laude\", the highest rating that can be awarded.\n\nOn 18 January Schmitt gave a radio interview in which he stated that around 30–35 pages in his thesis was material original to him and contained conclusions drawn from the \"core material\". (See below.) In response, Heti Világgazdaság reported that, in contrast to what Schmitt stated in the radio interview, the Conclusions section of his thesis (a single page) is also mostly part of the material that had been lifted from Georgiev's work.\n\nOn 19 January, the news portal Index.hu reported that parts of the remaining 35 pages of Schmitt's dissertation were translated and copied from German sport sociologist Klaus Heinemann's 1991 work \"The Economics of Sport: The Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition\". A reference to this work was found in Schmitt's Bibliography, but again, the title was translated into Hungarian, where no such translation existed. Later that day, Heti Világgazdaság—in possession of the text of Schmitt's dissertation—confirmed that a direct translation of eight out of the nine pages of Heinemann's work amounts to further 17 pages of Schmitt's dissertation. Heti Világgazdaság published another five-page PDF document comparing Heinemann's work and Schmitt's dissertation.\n\nOn 6 March hvg.hu announced that they have identified further sources.\nAccording to hvg.hu the first few pages of Schmitt's dissertation contain text from a 1990 educational brochure (\"The Olympic Movement / Le Mouvement Olympique\") published by the International Olympic Committee. Though the Bibliography section of the dissertation contains a reference to this work, it is given in Hungarian and with incorrectly specified bibliographic information. Text drawn from the Olympic Charter (1992) has also been found in Schmitt's work.\nhvg.hu also reported that the seven tables and two charts that make up the appendix of Schmitt's dissertation have also been taken from Georgiev's 1987 manuscript \"Analyse du programme olympique\", without proper attribution of authorship.\n\nThe original hvg.hu research that broke the controversy was done by an anonymous freelancer, and regular commenter on the hvg.hu website, over a stretch of nine months, with interruptions. The origins of the remaining circa 18 pages are not known, but the staff of hvg.hu were researching whether they are Schmitt's own work or not.\n\nFurther plagiarized sources were identified by readers of the website Index.hu on 29 March. Among others, Schmitt included word-by-word translations from a work by IOC member Anita DeFrantz without referencing it at all. (Anita DeFrantz happens to be the one who recommended Schmitt's daughter Petra for a University of Southern California tennis scholarship during the Salt Lake City Olympic bid. Petra Schmitt went on to make All-American of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.)\n\nConflict of interest concerns regarding the doctoral thesis committee have been raised.\n\nSchmitt defended his 1992 thesis before a committee headed by József Tihanyi. The other four members were Csaba Istvánfi, the late Mihály Nyerges and the two reviewers, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács.\n\nIn an article on 18 January Népszabadság cited the 37th section of the 1985 Doctoral Regulations of the Hungarian College of Physical Education, which stated that a person from whom an objective assessment of the candidate's work cannot be expected may not participate in review of the doctoral dissertation. In the opinion of Népszabadság, István Kertész and Ferenc Takács both had conflicting interests, since they were members of the Council of the Hungarian Olympic Academy (MOA, an organization founded by the Hungarian Olympic Committee), headed by Schmitt.\n\nOn 19 January the news portal Origo stated that Ferenc Takács had been a member of the MOA since 1985, and that István Kertész became a member in 1992. In 1992 both Csaba Istvánfi and Mihály Nyerges were members of the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB), and József Tihanyi joined in 1994. Ferenc Takács is also a member. Schmitt was the president of the MOA between 1985 and 1990, and general secretary of the MOB between 1990 and 2010.\n\nJózsef Tihanyi told Origo that \"with hindsight it is unfortunate\" that Schmitt had to defend his dissertation before committee members who were also members of the MOB, but he added that the university regulations at that time only regulated conflicts of interest that were limited to the university.\n\nFour hours after the publication of the hvg.hu article that raised the issue of plagiarism the Office of the President issued the following statement:\n\nIn an interview with hvg.hu, Malina Georgieva, daughter of the late Nikolay Georgiev, indicated that her father and Schmitt both worked at IOC in Lausanne and knew each other. Nonetheless, she found it implausible that the two cooperated on the research, and called the allegation of Georgiev omitting credit preposterous. She also denied any intention to litigate, noting that because her father's research was funded by the IOC, the IOC holds the copyright over the original document.\n\nSchmitt was attending the Youth Olympic Games in Austria at the time hvg.hu published the article on the alleged plagiarism. His first official appearance was six days later on 16 January at the residence of the President, Sándor Palace, where he appointed Norbert Csizmadia as state secretary of the Ministry for National Economy. The press was asked by a staff member of the Office of the President \"not to disrupt the event by asking questions\".\n\nSchmitt was scheduled to give a talk on 19 January at the Károly Eszterházy College in Eger. On 17 January students of the College received a message via the internal university website stating that \"[t]he Office of the President decided, considering the obligations of the students, that Dr Pál Schmitt, President of the Republic, is not going to disrupt the examination period (neither the exams nor the preparation for the exams) with his presentation\".\n\nOn 18 January Schmitt gave a half-hour radio interview on MR1, during which he was asked about the allegations.\nRegarding the lack of in-body citations he stated that the regulations at that time allowed for the listing the sources only as a Bibliography section at the end of the dissertation. He said that in his opinion, because he listed Georgiev's work in this Bibliography the term \"plagiarism\" has no relevance in this case.\n\nHe further stated that the 180 pages he used are basic data, and as such, they are not in the property of anyone. He also added that there are ns 30 to 35 pages in the dissertation that contain conclusions drawn by himself from the previously mentioned \"basic material\".\n\nRegarding the outcome of the controversy he said: \"I am looking forward to the resolution of this issue, and I sincerely hope that I can clear myself of the accusation behind which I cannot suspect anything more than mere malice.\"\n\nOn 19 January it was reported that, in contrast to Schmitt's statements in the radio interview, 18 of the remaining 35 pages were not original to him; since that point there have been no further comments from the President.\n\nOn 13 January the news portal Index.hu asked Péter Szijjártó, spokesman for Prime Minister of Hungary Viktor Orbán to comment on the issue; he wrote that \"we do not wish to address such an undeserving tabloid-hoax\". In a television interview for TV2 on 16 January, when asked what the official opinion of the Hungarian Government was responding to the allegations, Szijjártó reiterated: \"to tell you honestly, I find this whole thing undeserving, that they are trying to get the President of the Republic involved in such a tabloid-hoax\". He further added that he finds the timing of the accusations suspicious: \"this tabloid-hoax surfaced one day after the President of the Republic stood up firmly on the side of Hungary, against the attacks, at a reception for the leaders of the diplomatic corps.\"\n\nIn a television interview for ATV on 13 January András Giró-Szász, spokesman for the Hungarian Government was asked about the stance of the Government on the issue. He said: \"Look, my original profession and my studies have led me to the field of history at one time, and there I have learned, and this I can support with examples from history, that the head of the state is essentially the first person of the state. And the members of the Government are the servants of the state. Its first servants. [...] It follows from this that the only task of any Government in power in this regard is to unconditionally support the President of the Republic in office.\" The spokesman was then asked whether, in the opinion of the Government, Schmitt should resign if the allegations would turn out to be valid. He replied that there is no possibility of intervention, no obligation and no such intention from the side of the Government.\n\nIn the autumn of 2011 the State Secretariat for Education of the Ministry of National Resources published an announcement in which the state secretary for education, Rózsa Hoffmann reminded all university and college students that \"submitting a thesis written by someone else as one's own work constitutes a criminal offence\". She also wrote that if the Ministry of National Resources becomes aware of a case of thesis-related abuse, it is going to file a complaint with the National Police Headquarters. Hoffmann stressed that it is not permissible to allow students to obtain diplomas through fraud. In light of this announcement Heti Világgazdaság asked the Secretariat for Education on 13 January to comment on the issue of Schmitt's alleged plagiarism; Hoffmann's Secretariat told the journalists that they should turn to the Office of the President instead.\n\nOn 19 January Index.hu reported that parts of Schmitt's dissertation came from Klaus Heinemann's \"The Economics of Sport: the Institution of Modern Sport as an Area of Economic Competition\". hvg.hu soon confirmed this finding, stating that eight pages out of Heinemann's nine-page long work correspond to about 17 pages in Schmitt's dissertation.\nOn 23 January Heinemann told Index.hu that he is seriously concerned by the case, partially because of professional ethical reasons, especially since an important politician is involved. He added: \"My scientific recognition is significantly linked to this work of mine that contains important findings, therefore it is shocking to hear that others have used it to further their academic recognition undeservingly.\" Heinemann also responded to earlier reports that Semmelweis University has difficulties setting up a committee of inquiry because experts qualified to be members are turning down requests to join. He wrote: \"It reflects badly on my Hungarian colleagues, if, because of political opportunism, they are reluctant to punish those who violate basic and essential ethical norms of science.\"\n\nOn 16 January, seven scholars, mainly historians, started a petition asking the rector of the Semmelweis University, the Minister of National Resources, and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences for a fair, public and transparent investigation of the allegations. The authors of the petition expressed their dissatisfaction with the reaction of the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University who stated that the procedure of the issuance of the dr. univ. title was according to regulations, the reviews were unambiguous, therefore did not call for a formal investigation.\n\nPhysicist Rezső Lovas, a member of the MTA and the president of the Batthyány Society of Professors, a conservative association of university lecturers, said on 17 January: \"First of all, one should not jump to hasty conclusions. I have not seen Pál Schmitt's dissertation, nor the article he allegedly drew from. There are many ways of drawing from [sources], and there is a continuous transition between citation and explicit plagiarism\". He also added that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid. He further asked whether there was any evidence presented, stating that the burden of proof is on those accusing Schmitt.\n\nOn 18 January, in response to the petition, József Pálinkás, president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences wrote that since Schmitt does not hold a scientific degree (PhD) and is not a member of the public body of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the Academy has no jurisdiction to conduct an investigation into the allegations of plagiarism.\n\nOn 11 January György Bazsa, president of the Hungarian Accreditation committee stated that an investigation needs to be conducted by the university that issued the title. Károly Rácz, head of the Semmelweis University Doctoral Council did not wish to comment on the allegations of plagiarism regarding Schmitt's dissertation, stating that the dr. univ. degree was not awarded by the doctoral school that issues PhD titles introduced in 1993.\n\nOn 13 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University issued a statement claiming that the evaluation and the issuance of the dr. univ. title was conducted according to standard procedures and that according to experts the content of the dissertation adhered to the requirements at that time. He further stated that \"there is no reason to assume that the thesis committee did not deliver a well-founded decision\" when it assessed Schmitt's 1992 dissertation.\n\nOn 17 January Tivadar Tulassay, the rector of the Semmelweis University instructed Miklós Tóth, the dean of Faculty of Sport Sciences, to assemble a committee of inquiry to investigate \"the circumstances under which Pál Schmitt’s doctoral dissertation came into being.\"\n\nOn 21 January Népszabadság reported that experts qualified to assess the allegations are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee of inquiry. In the opinion of Népszabadság this is obviously due to the politically sensitive nature of the issue.\n\nOn 24 January Népszabadság reported that the Semmelweis University is exploring the possibility asking experts from outside the country to examine Paul Schmitt's doctoral dissertation. These experts would investigate whether the quotations in the dissertation form Georgiev's and Heinemann's works have been used correctly and according to the regulations. It is argued that if the suspected plagiarism is confirmed, then it will be easier to carry out the necessary administrative and legal measures.\n\nThe same day hvg.hu wrote that its sources confirmed the earlier reports that experts are turning down requests to participate in the work of the committee that is designated to investigate the allegations of plagiarism in Schmitt's dissertation. According to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the reason for the experts' reluctance is a fear that they may suffer a disadvantage in their careers. University sources did not confirm the reports that the university is considering to ask for the participation of experts from outside the country. Semmelweis University ordered a news black-out but, according to the sources of Heti Világgazdaság, the university would like to see the case closed as soon as possible, although the investigations could be prolonged until autumn 2013.\n\nOn 25 January Miklós Tóth, the dean of the Faculty of Sport Sciences at Semmelweis University announced that a five-member fact-finding committee had been set up, and would deliver a report by 28 March. The committee included both external and internal members, experts in linguistics, law, sports and the social sciences. The members of the committee remained anonymous for the duration of the investigation.\n\nThe members of the fact-finding committee were:\n\nIssues of conflicts of interest have been raised with regard to the fact-finding committee; Népszabadság found it problematic that Miklós Tóth became dean and a member of the MOB after the FIDESZ-KDNP government took office, and he became vice-president of the Olympic Committee during the course of the investigation.\n\nThe committee released a 3-page summary of its 1,100-page report to the public on 28 March. The report states that the 197 pages in question were indeed verbatim copies of Georgiev's and Heinemann's respective works. However, the report also states the lack of citations and references were \"formal mistakes\" that should have been addressed by the supervisors, who, by failing to do so, could have led Schmitt to believe that the thesis met the requirements. Semmelweis University, citing privacy reasons, has not made the majority report public. Heti Világgazdaság filed a complaint about the university's argument with the Hungarian National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information. The summary, after establishing the legal context for awarding the dr. univ. title at the University of Physical Education, has the following sections.\n\nThe report notes that conspicuously (although not against the regulations), the defense took place barely a month after registration.\nSome missing documents, however, imply formal irregularities. Namely, the thesis proposal, the report on the comprehensive examination, and the minutes of the thesis committee could not be found.\nThe report faults the thesis advisor and the examiners for not alerting the candidate to the inappropriate or absent citations, which are largely typical of the thesis.\nFurther procedural errors are implied by the lack of proper bibliography (5 out of 21 cited references could not be identified; out of 23 self-citations, 10 could not be found, and 3 were cited wrongly).\n\nThe report asserts that the author did not indicate his sources anywhere in the thesis. The text uses neither quotation marks, nor author names in parentheses, nor footnotes, nor endnotes. The Committee also notes that the thesis does not contain any acknowledgments of support from collaborators. The report notes in particular the\ntextual identities with Klaus Heinemann's work, the figures and tables copied (with occasional minor modifications) from Nikolay Georgiev's manuscript, and further 180 text pages partially matching the same work.\n\nThe report draws the conclusion that the thesis procedure was, notwithstanding the procedural shortcomings, in accordance with the practices of the University of Physical Education at the time.\nThe thesis is based on a word-by-word translation of \"unusually large extent,\" which should have been detected at the defense. The report faults the University of Physical Education for leading the author believe that this thesis met the requirements.\n\nThe only external member of the fact-finding committee, Ákos Fluck, submitted a minority report that became public on the evening of 27 March.\nThe minority report notes that it has been established that \"figure 1\" of Schmitt's dissertation is a photocopy of the figure on page 10 of Georgiev's work. The report also notes that at one time Schmitt refers to a \"figure 10\" in the text, while the dissertation does not have ten figures; this part of the text is a direct translation taken from Georgiev's work, which indeed has a \"figure 10\". In the minority report, Ákos Fluck wrote: \"Based on the fact-finding work, an investigation into the possibility of, as well as the procedures for, withdrawing the doctorate title from the candidate is advised.\"\nThe minority report also recounted that Schmitt had received the fact-finding committee's chair in his office. The chair communicated Schmitt's opinion to the other committee members: Schmitt's good faith should not be questioned, since he was not alerted by his advisor and thesis committee about any possible shortcomings, thus echoing the fact-finding report's conclusion.\n\nThe report has met considerable controversy upon release, with members of opposition claiming that the Semmelweis University caved in to political pressure.\n\nPál Schmitt was attending the 2012 Seoul Nuclear Security Summit in South Korea at the time the three-page summary of the fact-finding committee was made public.\nSpeaking of the report Schmitt told the MTI that \"this final conclusion is a kind of satisfaction for [him]: I was right even back then 20 years ago, because I wrote a thesis to the best of my knowledge and in keeping with the circumstances and the requirements of the time\". He also said that he did \"not for a moment\" think that he would resign, as qualities other than his doctorate were the reasons for his election.\nSchmitt returned from the summit to Hungary at 10:30 pm (CET).\n\nOn 27 March Fidesz spokesperson Gabriella Selmeczi said that \"given the report of the fact-finding committee of the Semmelweis University, Fidesz considers the case closed\". In a press release the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP) stated that the report \"can bring satisfying closure to the allegations that questioned the originality of the president's dissertation\".\n\nIn a letter to Index.hu, Klaus Heinemann called the report's majority conclusion \"ridiculous nonsense\". In his opinion, had the committee appointed to investigate the allegations of plagiarism of zu Guttenberg come to the same conclusion—that is, putting the blame on the university itself—\"they would have won a prize for their excellent cabaret-joke\" and \"everyone would still be laughing at them to this day\". According to Index.hu, Heinemann was unaware that Schmitt's doctorate had been revoked by the University Senate.\n\nThe rector of Semmelweis University forwarded the fact-finding committee's report to Minister of National Resources Miklós Réthelyi on March 27, 2012. The University was of the opinion that only the Ministry had the authority to initiate the revocation of the dr. univ. title (citing a legal article on degrees awarded by defunct institutions of higher education). The Minister returned the report the following day, citing lack of jurisdiction.\n\nTivadar Tulassay, the rector of the Semmelweis University announced on March 29 that the Semmelweis University Council would launch proceedings in order to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title.\n\nThe same day the University Senate voted 33-4 to withdraw Schmitt's doctorate title.\n\nSchmitt canceled all his appointments for 30 March and Norbert Kiss, the Public Relations Manager of the Office of the President announced that at 8 pm Schmitt \"is going to answer all questions\" in a TV interview.\n\nOn 30 March 9 pm M1 aired a 15-minute, pre-recorded, heavily orchestrated interview in which Schmitt announced that he would not resign from office, as there was no connection between his role as President and his doctorate. He said that he had acted in good faith regarding his dissertation, and that he had been led to believe by his thesis committee that his conduct had been correct, effectively repeating the majority conclusion of the Semmelweis University fact-finding committee. He also said that he intended to write a new dissertation and acquire a Ph.D. degree.\n\nOn 29 March Botond Szalma, the president of KDNP's Budapest group issued a statement in which he hailed the decision of the University Council and asked for the apology or resignation of those politicians who were \"working on ways to cover up this scandal instead of bringing the truth to light.\" He added: \"a sin must be called a sin, black must be called black, and white must be called white, as Christian morality dictates\".\n\nOn 31 March, after Schmitt announced that he was not considering resignation, KDNP issued a press release distancing the party from Szalma's statements, saying: \"The Christian Democratic People's Party would like to stress that the statements of the president of the Budapest group in the recent days do not reflect the views of the party as a whole, and the statements he made openly go against the official stance of the KDNP\".\n\nSoon after the controversy erupted, Rezső Lovas, the president of the Batthyány Society of Professors (PBK), a pro-government group of university lecturers said that in his opinion it is unlikely that the allegations can be proven valid.\n\nOn 29 March, after the Semmelweis University Council decided to initiate the revocation of Schmitt's doctorate, the Society issued a press release saying that \"The Doctoral Council has drawn the conclusions on the matter for its part. We hope that the president will do the same.\" They further state that \"at a time when we are suffering from a double standard used against our homeland, it is of utmost importance to have only one standard in our country, and that standard should be applied to everyone. In the current difficult situation that the country is in, there is a need for a president who is respected both at home and abroad.\"\n\nThe Batthyány Society of Professors came under criticism because of its handling of the case of Schmitt's plagiarism. Because of the support given to Schmitt and the lack of appropriate response an article on «hirszerzo.hu» termed the right-wing, Christian groups of academics and intelligentsia (such as the PBK, the Hungarian Association for Civic Cooperation and the Society of Christian Intellectuals) the \"\"Schmittpali\" Society of Professors\".\nA 31 March essay on Heti Világgazdaság called the Society \"professors abusing the name of Batthyány\".\n\nOn 2 April the president of the Hungarian Accreditation Committee announced that the decision of the University Senate was legitimate according to relevant regulations.\n\nOn 1 April Tivadar Tulassay resigned as rector of Semmelweis University. He had served as rector for nine years and his term would have ended on 1 July. As the reason for his immediate resignation, he cited a \"fundamental loss of trust\" that he perceived on the part of Minister of National Resources, Miklós Réthelyi, and State Secretary for Education, Rózsa Hoffmann, during the decision-making process. He also stated that he stands behind the decision made by the University Senate, on ethical, professional and legal grounds.\n\nAccording to a poll conducted by Medián and published on 18 January, 6% of Fidesz voters expressed the opinion that Schmitt should resign. 77% of the MSZP, LMP and DK, 28% of Jobbik supporters and 30% of independent voters thought that he should not remain in office. Taking the whole sample into consideration, 33% of the population thought that Schmitt should resign, while 42% thought that he should remain in office, the remaining 25% expressed no opinion.\n\nOn 2 April, the Hungarian Parliament received Schmitt's resignation from the office of President.\n\nOn 15 May 2013, Schmitt formally resigned from his doctorate after an academic remedy commission declared that his thesis did not meet the criteria, either in terms of content or formal requirements.\n\n"}

The Spec Racer Ford, manufactured and marketed by SCCA Enterprises (a subsidiary of SCCA, Inc.), is a high performance, closed wheel, open cockpit, purpose-built race car intended for paved road courses, such as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca, Buttonwillow Raceway Park, Road America, Watkins Glen, and many other tracks throughout North America. With more than 900 cars manufactured, it is the most successful purpose built road racing car in the United States.\n\nSpec Racer was first conceived as low-cost sports racing class by a director of the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA), Ted Cronin, in the early 1980s. The car was developed and originally manufactured by Renault/Jeep Sport USA in Livonia, Michigan under direction of Vic Elford. The car, designed by Roy Lunn, was introduced into SCCA Club Racing in 1984 as \"Sports Renault.\" After Renault bowed out of the program in 1989, the car was renamed \"Spec Racer (SR).\" The original Sports Renault/Spec Racer is now an SCCA Regional-only class and a few Renault powered cars still compete in National Auto Sport Association (NASA), Midwestern Council of Sports Cars Club (MCSCC) and Independent Motorsports Group (IMG) events. By 1994, the supply of rebuildable 1.7-liter Renault engines was drying up in the United States. The SCCA made the decision to replace the original Renault drivetrain with a 1.9-liter engine and five-speed transmission manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. This change gave the SRF an additional to 105 - enough to push the cars along at speeds up to . Ford Motor Company started to provide a new drivetrain in 1994 and the cars with the Ford powertrain renamed \"Spec Racer Ford (SRF).\" For a period of time, both Spec Racers (Renault powered) and Spec Racer Ford (Ford powered) both raced in the SCCA. Other more recent changes to what is now called \"Spec Racer Ford\" include the now-standard \"tallman kit\", which is an extension of the original rear roll hoop (which was designed too low), Penske shock absorbers in addition to the original Konis, Butler Built driver seat, alloy wheels, rear wheel well cutouts, engine coolant recovery system, adjustable fuel pressure regulator, a safety modification to the brakes and an optional, smaller alternator. During the life of the car, there have been some incremental changes in various parts to increase durability. Tires are Hoosier Racing Tire radials in both dry and rain tire versions, specifically manufactured for the SRF. The SRF still uses the original Renault brake calipers, outer CV joints, and suspension knuckles.\n\nIn early 2013, SCCA Enterprises announced a third generation (GEN3) Spec Racer Ford powered by a 1.6-liter 4-cylinder, 135 HP Ford engine fitted to the existing engine mounts and transmission. On-track testing by a fleet of test cars was conducted during 2013 and 2014 for a roll-out into SCCA competition in 2015. As of 2015, the new SRF3, GEN3 class was created and is now racing alongside the previous GEN2 (1.9-liter) cars. The existing Ford 1.9-liter Spec Racer (SRF) will continue to be eligible for SCCA Club Racing a separate National class until the end of 2017 after which it will remain competing in SCCA Club Racing as a Regional-only class. SRF3 cars race in SCCA Major, Divisional and Regional events.\n\nThe SRF rules dictate that no performance enhancing modifications other than suspension adjustments within described parameters can be made to the car. This effectively eliminates the never-ending need for design enhancements and associated large cash outlays necessary in other classes of racecars to remain competitive and puts the focus on driver skill, rather than financial and technical investment. Every Spec Racer Ford weighs the same using ballast that can accommodate drivers who weigh up to roughly 260 pounds, uses the same engine, the same transmission, the same fiberglass body, the same chassis, even the same tires. The idea is that all of the cars are meant to have identical performance, so the only way to go faster is to be a better driver. The SRF's engine, transmission, and shock absorbers are sealed with tamper-proof devices that make it impossible to modify these components undetected. In addition, many parts of the car, including suspension arms, fiberglass, and sheet metal are marked for compliance checking with special holographic tamper-evident stickers bearing the Spec Racer Ford logo. SCCA Enterprises periodically deploys compliance officials to conduct surprise inspections of Spec Racer Fords at SCCA Major, SCCA Regional and SCCA Pro Racing events across the US.\n\n\nThe Spec Racer Ford is available in \"iRacing\", and as a freeware download for \"rFactor\".\n\n\n"}

Due to delays in the nomination of a new election committee the election were likely to be moved to November, but then cancelled indefinitely after the military's overthrow of the Thai government.\n\nThe April elections were boycotted by the major opposition parties (the Democrat Party, the Mahachon Party, and Chart Thai Party). The results of the April elections, in which the ruling Thai Rak Thai Party won by a landslide, were disqualified by the Constitutional Court due to the placement of voting booths.\n\nOn 30 May, the Cabinet endorsed an Election Commission proposal to hold a new round of elections on 15 October 2006. The new election date allowed politicians 9 days time (by 8 June) to switch parties. The Thai constitution requires politicians to maintain their party membership for 90 days before being eligible to register as election candidates. The election date was affirmed by the signing of the royal decree by King Bhumibol Adulyadej on July 20, 2006.\n\nThe Constitutional Court and Opposition parties pressured the Election Commission to resign due to the disqualification of the April election. However, Commission head Vasana Puemlarp and the two other remaining commissioners refused to resign. The Criminal Court later jailed the three Commissioners who refused to resign, forcing the appointment of a new set of Commissioners.\n\nRumors were rampant prior to the election that many MPs from the ruling Thai Rak Thai would defect. Former TRT party-list MPs Likhit Dhiravegin and Sarit Santimethanedol left to establish the Phalang Phaendin party (\"Strength of the Land\"), claiming that 40 TRT Wang Nam Yen defectors would follow them. However, as of 5 June, no other MPs defected. Wang Nam Yom faction member Banyin Tangpakorn was quoted as saying that no more than 5 members wanted to defect.\n\nSanoh Thienthong, head of the TRT's powerful rebel Wang Nam Yen faction, had resigned from the TRT in February, along with his wife, Uraiwan (then Culture Minister). He later established the Pracharaj Party. Joining Sanoh in resigning from the TRT was party-list MP Winai Sompong. Sora-at Klinpratoom, another influential Wang Nam Yen member, resigned from the ICT Ministry, but did not resign from the TRT party. Outspoken businessman and founder of Thai Petrochemical Industry (TPI) Prachai Leophai-ratana also joined the Pracharaj Party as its secretary-general. Pramual Rujanasseri, Boonthueng Pholphanit and Chucheep Harnsawat were appointed as deputy party leaders.\n\nFormer Deputy Environment Minister Prapat Panyachatraksa (nicknamed \"Kan Yao\" for his heroism during the pro-democracy protests of 1973) had resigned from the TRT during the height of anti-Thaksin protests in March 2006.\n\nAs of May 2006, members of the Wang Bua Ban, Wang Phayanak, and Ban Rim Nam factions of the TRT party declared that they would not defect. Phayao MP Aruni Chamnanya was quoted as saying \"I am not a politician who sells myself by party hopping.\"\n\nTun Jintavej and Chatchawan Chompudaeng, members of the Mahachon Party, defected to the Chart Thai Party. Anek Laothammathat, the former Mahachon Party leader, joined the new Maharaj Party.\n\nFormer Chart Thai MP for Ratchaburi, Vijai Wattanaprasit, moved to the Pracharaj Party. Former Chat Thai MP for Chanthaburi Province Khomkhai Pollabutr moved to the Democrat Party.\n\nMahachon Party leader Sanan Kachornprasart claimed that former Democrat secretary-general Pradit Pattaraprasit had decided to join Mahachon and contest the election. However, Pradit, who had earlier resigned from the Democrat party, denied Sanan's claim.\n\nThe New Aspiration Party, led by Chingchai Mongcoltam, planned to merge with Maharaj. Outgoing Senators Kraisak Choonhavan and Karun Sai-ngam also joined Maharaj. Outgoing Senator Pichet Pattanachot joined the Democrat Party and plans to contest Nakhon Ratchasima's Constituency 1.\n\nThe political affiliation of former Deputy Prime Minister and TRT co-founder Purachai Piumsombun was the target of much political rumor. Purachai had earlier retired from politics, but his popularity led many to believe that he would re-enter politics under a different party. As Deputy Prime Minister, Purachai had led a controversial \"social order\" campaign that made him highly popular among many Bangkokians.\n\nThe People's Alliance for Democracy, which had led many anti-Thaksin protests from 2005 to 2006, established a new party, the Mass Party. However, they vowed not to field candidates for election. \"If we field MP candidates, we will be trapped in vicious circles of money politics,\" said Somkiat Pongpaibun, a PAD leader. Somkiat was joined by former Palang Dharma Party leader Chaiwat Sinsuwong and the Campaign for Popular Democracy's Pipop Thongchai.\n\nKhon Kaen caretaker Senator Rabiebrat Pongpanit co-founded the Thai Women party.\n\nOn 29 April, party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva promised an \"agenda for people\", with education as the main focus. He also vowed not to privatize basic utilities like electricity and water supply and also to nationalize those enterprises which had previously been privatized. However, he later backtracked and promised not to renationalize the oil and gas company PTT. He also promised that core Thai Rak Thai populist policies like the 30-baht universal healthcare scheme, the Village Fund and the SML scheme would not be cancelled but improved. He later promised that Thaksin's popular 30-baht universal healthcare scheme would be abolished immediately, and replaced with a system where access to medical services would be totally free. He also said that all future Democrat MPs will have to declare their assets and possible involvement in any private companies (under Thai law, only those who take a government position have to declare their assets). In addition, MPs, Government ministers, and their families would also be required to disclose benefits they received from business connections. He also proposed a 10 million THB limit to the amount that any individual could contribute to a political party in one year. He also proposed to reduce the number of votes necessary to force a vote of no confidence to just one-tenth of the House.\n\nAbhisit also promised many populist policies, including:\n\nOn the Democrat Party's 60th Anniversary dinner, Abhisit raised over THB 200 Million in funds from attendants. He outlined several energy policies including:\n\nOn 13 July 2006, facing escalating violence in the South, Abhisit promised to solve the insurgency by making the problems in the deep South a public agenda.\n\nIn late July 2006, party leader Abhisit Vejjajiva appeared on two television advertisements. The first tried to portray Abhisit as a family man, while the second suggested that people cope with the high cost of living by cutting down on energy consumption. Two additional advertisements were scheduled to air in August, the third focusing on free education, and the fourth on free health care. Prime Minister Thaksin commended the spots, and Abhisit claimed spots were well received. However, pollsters at ABAC Poll and the BU Poll Centre doubted that the spots would impress grassroots voters.\n\nThe Thai Rak Thai party promised to expand Bangkok's mass transit network with ten new electric train routes covering 300 km. The new network would have a flat cost of just 15 THB per ride. The TRT also proposed building home units along the new lines. The new rail networks would be built through direct government investment, rather than through private concessions.\n\nA nationwide poll conducted in mid-July found that 49% of respondents would vote for Thai Rak Thai, while 42.5% preferred one of the oppisiton parties. 84.3% of those surveyed said they would vote in the poll; of those, 29.2% said they would not vote for any political party, marking instead the \"no vote\" box, indicating abstention.\n\nA Bangkok poll in conducted mid-August found that 38% of respondents would vote for Thai Rak Thai, with 24% voting for the Democrats, 10% voting for Chart Thai, and 6% for other parties.\n\nIn the 30 July Bangkok Metropolitan Administration council elections, the Democrats won 35 out of 57 seats in the Bangkok city council, with 18 seats going to TRT. The Democrats also swept 176 out of 255 district council seats in the Bangkok district council elections held on the same day, while Thai Rak Thai won 71 seats and independent candidates won eight seats.\n\nOn 19 September 2006, less than a month before the scheduled elections, members of the Royal Thai Army staged a coup d'état against the government of Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. It is the country's first coup in 15 years, though the practice used to be commonplace, with 17 having occurred between 1932 and 1991.\n\nJunta leader General Sonthi Boonyaratglin announced the abrogation of the constitution, declared martial law, and dissolved Cabinet, Parliament, and the Constitutional Court. He promised that a civilian Prime Minister would be appointed within two weeks, but that a new constitution would be drafted before holding new elections a year in the future.\n"}

It was written by Rodney Amateau, based on the 1972 novel by Peter Driscoll. It had a limited release in the US. This is the third film teaming Sidney Poitier with director Ralph Nelson. The first time they worked together was in 1963 on \"Lilies of the Field\", the film for which Poitier received an Academy Award. Nelson also directed Poitier in \"Duel at Diablo\" in 1966.\n\nIn apartheid-era South Africa, Shack Twala (played by Sidney Poitier), a black revolutionary who had served time on Robben Island, is freed by Rina van Niekerk (Prunella Gee), his Afrikaner defence attorney, because he would be a victim of retroactive legislation. Rina, estranged from her husband Blane (Rutger Hauer), is having a relationship with an English mining engineer, Jim Keogh (Michael Caine), who has attended Shack's trial. Surprised by the verdict, Rina, Jim and Shack go off to celebrate at her house. They are stopped by the South African Police who are conducting identity document checks and arresting everyone who does not have their papers on them. As Shack has only just been released from prison he will not receive his papers until the next day. The police Constable and Shack antagonise each other leading to Shack being handcuffed and arrested. When Rina attempts to pull the Constable off Shack, the policeman hits her, knocking her to the ground. Jim assaults and knocks out the Constable making all three fugitives.\n\nAt Police Headquarters, an SAP Brigadier (Patrick Allen) is criticised by Major Horn (Nicol Williamson) of the South African Bureau of State Security (BOSS) for not only arresting Shack but continuing with their random identity checks and arrests that have infuriated world opinion.\n\nThe three fugitives are followed and monitored by BOSS to lead them to discover their escape route to Botswana and its facilitators, two Indian dentists; a stash of stolen uncut diamonds being used to fund the \"Black Congress\" (African National Congress) and the leader of the \"Black Congress\", a man named Wilby (Joe De Graft).\n\n\nAfter this motion picture, Poitier moved into both directing and acting. In addition, the film introduced Dutch actor Rutger Hauer to English-speaking audiences.

The show had previously gone under several other names, including \"Festival of British Popular Songs\" (1957), \"Eurovision Song Contest British Final\" (1959–1960), \"The Great British Song Contest\" (1996–1999), \"Eurovision: Making Your Mind Up\" (2004–2007), \"Eurovision: Your Decision\" (2008), and \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs You\" (2009–2010) but was known, for most of its history, as A Song for Europe (1961–1995, 2000–2003).\n\nThe selection process, originally broadcast on BBC One, has varied between selecting both the performer and song, or just the song in some years. For most years the public has been able to vote for the winner, in the past with postcard voting, where the viewers sent postcards with their vote to the BBC, but more recently televoting and online. In 2009 and 2010, the singer was chosen by a public vote and the song internally selected.\n\nThe most recent name and format was adopted in 2016, as between 2011 and 2015 the UK representation had been selected internally by the BBC, resulting in the televised selection show being suspended. On 30 September 2015, the BBC confirmed the show would return in 2016 and on 17 January 2016 that the national selection show would be called \"Eurovision: You Decide\" and broadcast on BBC Four.\n\nOn 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return on 27 January 2017 and aired on BBC Two. The format returned in 2018, again broadcast live on BBC Two.\n\nThe format of the show and the manner in which the winner is chosen has gone through many mutations. In its early days, there was a round of televised semi-finals, with the winner chosen by regional juries situated across the country. This format was used until 1960. During this era the show was known as the \"Festival Of British Popular Songs\" (1957) and \"Eurovision Song Contest British Finals\" (1959 & 1960). In 1961 the show became known by its more familiar title, \"A Song For Europe\", with regional juries once more deciding the winner. Typically, during that period, singers would be invited by the BBC to choose and perform a song that they liked from the shortlist available. Household names such as Petula Clark, Lita Roza, Anne Shelton, Frank Ifield, Ronnie Hilton and David Hughes were amongst the contenders for the UK competition, none of whom were able to secure the much cherished ticket to the Eurovision final. In the early 1960s, record companies became involved in the selection process for the first time and submitted songs by their artists. This produced hits for Craig Douglas, Karl Denver, Jackie Lee, Kenny Lynch, Vince Hill and Ricky Valance, but again, none of them were selected to go forward to the Eurovision Song Contest final itself.\n\nFrom 1964 up until 1975, an artist would be chosen by the BBC, and that artist would sing all six songs (five in 1966 and 1967) in the selection, and the public (bar 1964 and 1971) would choose by postcard which song they would like to represent them in the contest. Regional juries selected the winner in 1964. A postal strike in 1971 prevented the ballot from taking place, so regional juries were once again constructed to pick the winner. In 1972, national power cuts meant that the broadcast of the show was blacked out in many areas, leading to a much lower postal vote. In its early days of this format, only \"light entertainment\" singers were used, such as Kenneth McKellar and Kathy Kirby. However, the poor showing of McKellar in Luxembourg (he placed 9th of 18 entries with scores from only 2 countries, including top marks from Ireland) prompted the BBC to use more mainstream pop stars, which led to a run of successful results for the UK. This idea was dropped due to the low number of postal votes cast in the contest of 1975, in which all six songs were performed by The Shadows, and after objections from songwriters who felt The Shadows, and the BBC's selections in general, were not the sort of artists they wanted to represent their music.\n\nAfter 1964, the \"Song For Europe\" selection process was incorporated into other BBC light entertainment shows, in addition to the songs being broadcast on BBC Radio programmes. Typically, the performer would sing one song a week either on their own series or as a guest on another regular BBC TV show, more often than not, televised on Saturdays. This culminated with the performer singing all the songs one after another in a special edition of the given show. From 1968 to 1975, these performances were then immediately repeated before viewers were asked to cast their votes by mail. The following week, the winning song would be announced and performed once more, although there was a two-week wait in 1965. In 1968, Cliff Richard performed the songs only in a special edition of Cilla Black's eponymous TV series (broadcast on Tuesdays), without having sung them weekly beforehand. The various shows chosen for the \"Song For Europe\" performances were \"The Kathy Kirby Show\" (1965 shown on Fridays), \"Kenneth McKellar's A Song For Everyone\" (1966 shown on Thursdays), \"The Rolf Harris Show\" (1967), \"Cilla\" (1968 & 1973), \"Lulu\" (1969 & 1975), \"It's Cliff Richard!\" (, & ) and \"Clunk, Click... As It Happens\" (1974) – when in a break with the format, Olivia Newton-John performed three songs a week for two weeks rather than one a week for six weeks. Originally, Cilla Black's 1974 nine-part BBC series was also scheduled to feature the 'Song for Europe' process, but Black was uncomfortable at promoting another female singer (Newton-John) each week throughout the series' run and in a rather last minute decision, the BBC arranged to move the process to another show, necessitating the contracted process.\n\nThis period was highly successful for the UK in the Eurovision Song Contest. Author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in his book \"The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History\", that every UK entry to the contest from 1967 to 1977 finished in the top four, with only three songs not being first or second. Indeed, the UK were only 7 points short of four consecutive victories from 1967 to 1970.\n\nIn 1976, a new system was put into force. Twelve songs were performed by artists chosen by the songwriters themselves and the winner was chosen by regional juries across the country during a stand-alone show called \"A Song For Europe\". This system produced an immediate success by choosing the song which went on to be the Eurovision winner that year, \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" by Brotherhood of Man. The first few years of the revamped format also saw a plethora of well-known names take part in the competition. Frank Ifield, Tammy Jones, Sweet Sensation, Lyn Paul, Tony Monopoly, Carl Wayne, Hazell Dean, Tony Christie, The Foundations, Labi Siffre, Guys 'n' Dolls, The Nolan Sisters, Polly Brown and Sweet Dreams all took part in the competition, but none were successful. Likewise, the first two winners of the contest, Brotherhood of Man and Lynsey de Paul & Mike Moran, had many hits under their belts before attempting Eurovision.\n\nIn 1977, a strike by BBC cameramen led to the contest being blacked out on TV, although the show went ahead and the audio portion was later broadcast on BBC Radio 2. The TV programme has never been broadcast and is not listed in the BBC archives, yet it was transmitted to the various regional juries in BBC studios around the country, in order for them to cast their votes. The 1979 \"A Song For Europe\" final was never held at all, due to a strike by BBC sound engineers. The juries had to judge using audio recordings of the rehearsals. The songs were presented to the public on Terry Wogan's radio show the following day, after the result was known, followed later in the day with a spot on the TV magazine show \"Nationwide\", where the top 5 were revealed and the winners, Black Lace, were interviewed as guests on the show. As a result of this industrial action, all future contests were staged at BBC studios and not as outside broadcasts from venues. The 1980 result ended in a tie between Prima Donna's \"Love Enough For Two\" and Maggie Moone's \"Happy Everything\". To resolve this, in an unrehearsed panic, host Terry Wogan called back the juries to announce their favourite of the two songs. This led to extreme confusion when the scoreboard failed to keep up and some juries contradicted the results they had given earlier. Prima Donna won, with eight juries to Maggie Moone's six. A detailed check of the votes after the show did confirm that Prima Donna were the correct winners. Prima Donna were the first winners of the competition specifically formed to take part in Eurovision. This became the norm in the 1980s and the artists taking part in the contest became more and more obscure and amateurish. However, a few notable acts did enter the contest in the 1980s, with scant success. Liquid Gold, Alvin Stardust, Sinitta and Hazell Dean all failed to come through the heats.\n\nBy 1981, the number of songs had dropped to eight, and interest had started to wane. Four out of eight songs in both the 1982 and 1984 events were written by Paul Curtis, who was unsurprisingly responsible for the 1984 winner; \"Love Games\". Following Belle & The Devotions' performance at the 1984 Eurovision contest in Luxembourg, the audience audibly booed them from the stage in an orchestrated demonstration against the song's supposed plagiarism, and by the local audience retaliating against a particularly shocking violent attack by English soccer fans. For 1985, the BBC wanted to revert to having one singer of their choice perform all the short listed songs and approached Bonnie Tyler and when she was unavailable, Lena Zavaroni for the task. However, the Music Publisher's Association blocked the move, wanting their members the choice of their own singers to represent their music. A compromise was reached and only solo artists or duets – no \"made for Eurovision\" acts – were permitted to take part in the 1985 UK selection process and limited two entries per songwriter. Despite this rule, both songs submitted by Paul Curtis reached the final eight. They reverted to allowing all-comers for 1986. Starting in 1985, the songs were also 'previewed' on Terry Wogan's prime time chat show on BBC1 ahead of the final. When the series ended in 1992, the songs were presented in 1993 and 1994 in stand-alone programmes, hosted by Terry.\n\nThe number of entries briefly increased to ten in 1987 when record companies were invited to submit songs, but after a poor result from Rikki in the Eurovision final of 1987, the regional juries were disbanded, and the final decision given to the public through telephone voting, with a celebrity panel offering comments on the entries intended to guide viewers. This proved to be a relative success, accruing two second places and a sixth place (Zagreb, 1990). However, a disappointing 10th place in Rome obtained by Samantha Janus led the BBC to rethink the standard of performers in the competition.\n\nAs a result of the disappointing results in 1990 & 1991, the system that was used between 1964 and 1975 was resurrected, with the BBC's head of light entertainment, Jim Moir choosing one artist to perform all the songs in the UK final. Michael Ball was the first in 1992, and went on to win second place. Sonia was also second the following year. However, after a suggestion by Don Black to the BBC's new head of light entertainment David Liddiment in 1994, Tony Award winning stage star Frances Ruffelle was offered the job of representing the UK. A virtually unknown singer, unsurprisingly, interest was low. Her final position in the Eurovision Song Contest held in Dublin was a disappointing tenth, the same achieved by Samantha Janus in 1991.\n\nA dramatic modernisation was introduced in 1995 in an attempt to boost the profile of the contest. Pop supremo Jonathan King was drafted in as Executive Producer to make the event more modern. The 1995 event had a diverse range of songs and some relatively well-known acts performing, such as Londonbeat who had a hit with \"I've Been Thinking About You\", pop-combo Deuce and Sox, which featured singer and former Page 3 icon Samantha Fox. All songs were presented on a special edition of \"Top Of The Pops\" prior to the live final. On the night, the well-known artists were all beaten by rap act Love City Groove, whose eponymous song could only manage a disappointing tenth in Dublin that year. On a positive note, the songs by Love City Groove and Deuce (I Need You) made the top 10 in the UK singles charts, reaching #7 and #10 respectively, while three other entries – Dear Jon \"One Gift of Love\" at #68, Londonbeat \"I'm Just Your Puppet On A... (String!)\" at #55 and Sox \"Go For The Heart\" at #47 – all reached the UK top 100.\n\nIn 1996, a semi-final was introduced. All eight songs were performed on \"Top of the Pops\" on 1 March, and the public voted to decide the four finalists. The results were announced the following day, but there was no information given on who finished where. On 8 March the final was held, with Gina G winning very easily with her dance number \"Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit\". The song became an instant hit in the charts, reaching Number 1 on the UK Singles Chart. It was the first UK non-winner to do so since 1968 but it was not as successful in the Eurovision Contest itself. In Oslo, Gina could only manage eighth place, but was perhaps consoled by her Europe-wide hit with the song, which also became one of the few Eurovision songs, and one of the relatively few dance songs, to be a major hit in the United States where it peaked at #12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, was #1 on their Dance Chart and earned a Grammy nomination for Best Dance Recording.\n\nJonathan King resigned, certain that, if Gina G couldn't win, nothing he selected could, but the BBC persuaded him to stay in charge and he decided to retain the same formula again, but with an added twist. All eight contestants would be heard on Ken Bruce's radio show on BBC Radio 2, with a public vote to decide the four finalists. The four would perform on \"The National Lottery Live\" until 1998, and then on \"Top of the Pops\" in 1999. The final itself would just consist of repeats of the performances made in the above shows, in a special programme on a Sunday afternoon. Jonathan persuaded his friends Katrina and Kimberley Rew, who had hit with \"Walking On Sunshine\", to enter a new track, \"Love Shine A Light\". This produced a win in the Eurovision Contest itself for the United Kingdom and for Katrina and the Waves in 1997, and followed with a second place for Imaani in 1998, but disappointment in 1999 for the all-girl band Precious.\n\nIn 2000, the same format continued, but the final four songs were performed live in \"A Song For Europe\", still shunted to a graveyard Sunday afternoon slot. The result proved disappointing. Nicki French gave what author John Kennedy O'Connor describes in his book The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History as a far from strong performance, despite her previous chart success and attained the UK's worst ever placing at the time, a mere 16th in Stockholm with \"Don't Play That Song Again\". This format continued the following year, and another poor showing for the UK. Lindsay D only got one place higher in Copenhagen. The entries from Six Chix in 2000 and Luke Galliana, the latter of which didn't make the 2001 final, became minor hits, with Galliana just failing to make the Top 40, but becoming a popular hit on cable request line music channel The Box.\n\nThe 2002 \"A Song For Europe\" generated a lot of publicity, because three of the four acts that made the final were relatively well known to TV viewers, albeit not necessarily for their singing ability. Surf 'n' Turf included Jonathan Maitland who is a TV presenter of consumer advice shows such as \"Watchdog\" and \"House of Horrors\". Tricia Penrose is an actress who plays Gina in the 60s retro drama \"Heartbeat\" on ITV, and Jessica Garlick had made the final stages of another ITV show \"Pop Idol\". The standard of songs was stronger than previous years, and Jessica Garlick had a runaway victory of nearly 70,000 votes with her ballad \"Come Back\". The song was also a success in Eurovision with it finishing joint third with host country Estonia.\n\n2003 saw terrible disappointment. The new voting system of regional televoting, where 9, 10 and 12 points were awarded to the top three songs, led to an unsuccessful winner. Jemini's \"Cry Baby\" won by four points over \"Help Me\" by Emily Reed. Confidence in the UK entry was low for both fans and the public, and in the actual contest held in Riga, Jemini picked up the UK's worst-ever showing, scoring \"nul points\" and finishing last, due to a very poor performance, although some reports attempted to blame European disapproval of the US-UK invasion of Iraq for the failure of any nation to give the UK even one point. As noted by author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor, with 26 entries in the Eurovision field, this made \"Cry Baby\" the least successful song in the entire history of the contest. No song in the Eurovision final scored \"nul points\" again until 2015.\nThe 2004 selection was totally different. Gone was the \"Song For Europe\" name, replaced with \"Making Your Mind Up\". The radio semi-final was also gone, and the six songs were performed live in a Saturday night show. This raised the profile of the competition, although there was criticism of the fact that four of the six acts were from reality TV shows. The winner, chosen by 70% regional televoting (regions awarding 0,2,4,6,8 and 12 points) and 30% SMS and Interactive voting, was James Fox, who had finished fifth in the second series of \"Fame Academy\", with a gentle ballad \"Hold On To Our Love\", written by Gary Miller and Tim Woodcock. Viewing figures were peaked at over 7 million for the results show. The song finished 16th at the contest in Istanbul.\n\nFor 2005, six songs dropped to five, and the show was moved to an early Saturday evening slot on 5 March, to avoid a clash with \"Comic Relief Does Fame Academy\"; and Natasha Kaplinsky replaced Gaby Roslin as co-host with Sir Terry Wogan. The press focused on two performers. Javine Hylton who is a relatively well-known urban singer, and Katie Price, aka Jordan, a famous glamour model. The other contestants included former 3SL bandmember Andy Scott-Lee, the 1996 British Eurovision entry Gina G and unknown opera trio Tricolore. The voting itself was the same format as the previous year, but this time an online jury was added to decide between the contestants to take account of the views of those watching in the rest of Europe. After an exciting voting sequence, Javine came out on top with her ethno-urban song \"Touch My Fire\", although she also caused some controversy when she briefly fell out of her top during an energetic dance routine. At the 50th Eurovision Song Contest held in Kiev, Javine finished 22nd out of 24 participants in the final, the UK's second poorest finish ever.\n\nIn February 2006 it was announced that artists competing in the 2006 contest would include Kym Marsh and Anthony Costa, both relatively well known in the UK for their past involvement with music bands (the former appearing in Hear'say and the latter in boy band Blue). Following the format of the previous year (and with six songs this time), \"Making Your Mind Up\" returned in 2006 in a prime-time Saturday evening slot, and was broadcast on 4 March on BBC One. Terry Wogan and Natasha Kaplinsky once again presented and were accompanied by a 'Celebrity Jury' that included chat-show host Jonathan Ross, pop star Kelly Osbourne and \"Top of the Pops\" presenter Fearne Cotton. The eventual winner of the 2006 contest (after the 7 tele-juries from around the UK and mobile and web votes) was Daz Sampson and his song \"Teenage Life\". Yet another low result was produced for the United Kingdom, as Daz finished 19th in the contest out of 24 competing countries.\n\nDuring a press conference on 28 February 2007, the BBC confirmed that the artists taking part in \"Making Your Mind Up\" would include Big Brovaz, an RnB group who had 4 UK Top 10 singles in 2002–2003, Brian Harvey, a former member of the boy band East 17; Cyndi; Justin Hawkins of The Darkness, performing a duet with Beverlei Brown; Liz McClarnon, formerly of girl group Atomic Kitten; and Scooch, the eventual winners with \"Flying the Flag (for You)\". Scooch sang their entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 on 12 May 2007 in Helsinki, Finland and finished in second-to-last place with 19 points, ahead of Ireland who placed last.\n\nFor the first time, the show was filmed at The Maidstone Studios in Kent. The hour long final was broadcast at 7:30pm on 17 March 2007 on BBC One, with the half hour results show showing at 9:30pm on the same date. Although this was past the 12 March cut-off set by the EBU, the BBC were given a special extension because the EBU were made aware of this over a year in advance.\n\nThe show ended in disarray when Fearne Cotton shouted out that the winner was Scooch, while co-host Terry Wogan simultaneously announced the winner to be Cyndi. After some confusion from both performers, each thinking the other had won, it was revealed that the true winner was Scooch.\n\nIn 2008 the show's name was changed to \"Eurovision: Your Decision\". It was screened in two parts in March 2008, and was hosted by Claudia Winkleman and Sir Terry Wogan. The six competing acts were paired as girl groups (LoveShy and The Revelations), soloists (Michelle Gayle and Andy Abraham), and \"Joseph and Maria\" contestants (Rob McVeigh and Simona Armstrong) from the BBC talent shows \"Any Dream Will Do\" and \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?\". A panel of three judges (John Barrowman, Carrie Grant, and Terry Wogan) decided which artists to put through to a semi-final after each pair had performed. Terry Wogan then allowed one of the rejected acts through as a \"wild card\" before viewers were invited to vote by phone to decide which two would perform again in the final. The two finalists chosen by the viewers were Michelle Gayle singing \"Woo (You Make Me)\", and Andy Abraham singing \"Even If\". Despite having been originally eliminated at the first stage, Terry Wogan's \"wild card\" pick turned out to be the winner when the viewers voted Andy Abraham the victor with \"Even If\". This received a total of 14 points in the Eurovision Song Contest 2008 on 24 May 2008 in Belgrade, finishing in last place, although sharing the same score with Poland (24th) and Germany (23rd).\nThe BBC announced in a televised call for talent on 18 October 2008, that in 2009 there would be another change to the national final. The show was renamed \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs You\", hosted by Graham Norton, and followed a format similar to popular BBC talent shows \"I'd Do Anything\" and \"Any Dream Will Do\". The multi-week format had members of the public (amateur or professional) compete to represent the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, which was to be held in Moscow, Russia. In the final the three remaining contestants performed the song \"It's My Time\", composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber with lyrics by Diane Warren. The winner of the contest was Jade Ewen who went on to score a credible fifth place at the Eurovision final in Moscow.\n\nFor 2010, the BBC announced on 29 January 2010, that songwriter and music producer Pete Waterman would be writing the UK's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo, Norway, on 29 May. Waterman's writing partner was Mike Stock and the singer was chosen on 12 March, in a live show featuring six potential artists broadcast on BBC One, hosted by Graham Norton. Waterman chose three of the six acts to perform his song \"That Sounds Good To Me\", with the televiewers then selecting the winner. The winner was Josh Dubovie, who represented the UK in Oslo on 29 May and finished last with 10 points. The 2010 song was heavily criticised by fans and the media. Celebrity gossip blogger Christopher Couture went as far as to say \"...last year, Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jade Ewen proved a good song and a good singer can get us a good score. This year, we're back to the bottom of the leaderboard as Pete 'stuck in the 80's' Waterman offers a song that even Butlins would call tacky.\"\n\nOn 29 January 2011, the BBC confirmed that boy band Blue had been chosen to represent the UK in the 2011 contest in Düsseldorf with the composition \"I Can\" written by Duncan James, Lee Ryan, Ciaron Bell, Ben Collier, Ian Hope, Liam Keenan and 'StarSign'. Band member Anthony Costa had tried to represent the UK in 2006 as a soloist, placing second in the heat behind Daz Sampson. Other Blue personnel Lee Ryan had written one of the finalists in the 2005 UK heat and Duncan James was a panellist in the 2009 heat, going on to announce the UK scores at the Eurovision final from Moscow. James posted in a separate Twitter message that they have pre-selected their own song. The process thus excludes the UK viewing public from any participation in the British Eurovision selection for the first time. Blue became the first UK representatives since The Shadows in 1975 to have had multiple No.1 singles in the UK chart prior to appearing in Eurovision, and the first since Sonia in 1993 to have had a chart-topper at all. A documentary entitled \"Eurovision: Your Country Needs Blue\" was produced for BBC One broadcast on Saturday 16 April 2011. The group placed 11th at the Eurovision final with 100 points and peaked at no.16 in the UK singles chart.\n\nFor 2012, Engelbert Humperdinck was selected internally by the BBC to represent the UK in Baku, Azerbaijan with the song \"Love Will Set You Free\". The song is written by Grammy award-winning producer Martin Terefe and Ivor Novello winner Sacha Skarbek, who co-wrote James Blunt hit \"You're Beautiful\". It was reportedly recorded in London, Los Angeles and Nashville. At 76 years of age, Humperdinck was the oldest artist ever to appear for the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest and the first UK artist since 1976 to sing first. He placed second-to-last, only beating Norway.\n\nAnother internal selection took place for 2013, with Bonnie Tyler being chosen by the BBC to represent the UK in Malmö, Sweden. She came a lowly 19th in the Eurovision contest.\n\nA fourth internal selection followed in 2014, with Molly Smitten-Downes, under her artist name of Molly, being chosen to represent the UK with the song \"Children of the Universe\", written and composed by Smitten-Downes herself. However, Smitten-Downes was an unknown artist who was chosen through the BBC Introducing scheme. The announcement of the selected artist and song was revealed on 3 March 2014 in a show entitled \"The UK Launch\", and broadcast via the BBC Red Button service. The song finished in 17th place at the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nA fifth internal selection in 2015 selected the unknown act 'Electro Velvet' who went on to represent the UK with the song \"Still in Love with You\". The song was met with a mixed to negative reaction by the media and public. The artists and song were presented to the public in a special presentation show titled \"Our Song for Eurovision 2015\" broadcast via the BBC Red Button service in March 2015. In the final the UK could only manage 24th place out of the 27 entries.\nThe BBC announced on 30 September 2015 that the national public vote format would be returning for the 2016 contest. The 2016 competition consisted of six entrants, performed and broadcast live on BBC Four from The O2 Forum in Kentish Town, London on 26 February and hosted by Mel Giedroyc. The six acts were selected by the UK branch of the international OGAE fan club, the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) and Hugh Goldsmith, former MD of RCA Records and founder of Innocent Records. The six competing songs were premiered during \"The Ken Bruce Show\" on BBC Radio 2 on 22 February 2016. \"You're Not Alone\" performed by Joe and Jake won the national final; 746,000 viewers watched the show either live or within 7 days of its broadcast, making it the third highest rating program for BBC Four in the week ending 28 February 2016. The duo placed 24th out of 26 entries at the Eurovision final in Stockholm, peaking at No.81 in the UK singles chart.\n\nOn 6 October 2016, the BBC announced that the \"You Decide\" show would return in 2017 with more details to be announced later in the year. On 9 December 2016, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return on 27 January 2017. The 2017 competition consisted of six entrants, performed and broadcast live on BBC Two from the Eventim Apollo, in Hammersmith, London. The songs were revealed on 23 January during \"The Ken Bruce Show\" on BBC Radio 2. Six acts competed in the national final. The winner was selected through a public vote and, for the first time, the votes of a professional jury panel. Lucie Jones with the song \"Never Give Up on You\", written by Lawrie Martin, The Treatment and Danish Eurovision 2013 winner Emmelie de Forest, won the show. At the contest in Kiev, Jones finished in 15th place, having placed 10th on jury votes alone, but attaining a weak score from public voting.\n\nOn 29 September 2017, it was confirmed that \"Eurovision: You Decide\" would return in 2018 on BBC Two. On 16 November 2017, Måns Zelmerlöw was announced as co-host for the UK national selection, which took place on 7 February 2018 at the Brighton Dome. The Dome was the venue for the Eurovision Song Contest 1974. The contest was won by SuRie performing \"Storm\" written and composed by Nicole Blair, Gil Lewis and Sean Hargreaves. The national final was watched by 900,000 viewers in the United Kingdom with a market share of 4.8% and thus failed to register in the Top 30 programmes viewed on BBC Two for the week.\n\nSong submissions for the 2019 edition opened on 19 September 2018. On 30 November, the BBC announced thar a new format would be used for 2019. Three songs, selected with the help of an international jury, will each be performed in two musically different styles by two different artists, with one act from each pair going through to a final public vote. For the first time, the national final will be broadcast live from Dock10, MediaCityUK in Salford.\n\nFrom 1964–1975, the \"Song For Europe\" programme was pre-recorded, often several weeks in advance. The result was typically broadcast one week after each \"Song For Europe\" programme. From 1988–1991, in 1995, and again from 2004–2008 the result was broadcast in a separate programme, shown later the same night as the performances. From 1986 to 1995, \"A Song For Europe\" was also broadcast by BBC Radio 2 with commentary by Ray Moore in 1986–87 and later by Ken Bruce from 1988, although Radio 2 did not broadcast the results show from 1991 onwards.\n\nFrom 1992–1994 the programme was again pre-recorded, but the result show was live and broadcast the same night. In 1997 and 1998, the results were announced the next Saturday after the final and on the following Friday in 1999.\n\nFrom 1957–1960, there were various televised semi-finals ahead of the UK final. This was reintroduced in 1996, with a preliminary round of voting to eliminate 4 of the 8 songs. This was televised in 1996 but switched to radio from 1997 to 2003.\n\nFeatured in 1988–1990, 1994–1995, 2004–2010 and since 2016.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "439436", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=439436", "title": "USS Panay incident", "text": "USS Panay incident\n\nThe USS \"Panay\" incident was a Japanese attack on the American gunboat while it was anchored in the Yangtze River outside Nanking (now spelled Nanjing), China on 12 December 1937. Japan and the United States were not at war at the time. The Japanese claimed that they did not see the American flags painted on the deck of the gunboat, apologized, and paid an indemnity. Nevertheless, the attack and the subsequent Allison incident in Nanking caused U.S. opinion to turn against the Japanese.\n\nA flat-bottomed craft built in Shanghai specifically for river duty, \"Panay\" served as part of the US Navy's Yangtze Patrol in the Asiatic Fleet, which was responsible for patrolling the Yangtze River to protect American lives and property in China.\n\nAfter invading China in the summer of 1937, Japanese forces moved in on the city of Nanking (now known as Nanjing) in December. \"Panay\" evacuated the remaining Americans from the city on 11 December, bringing the number of people aboard to five officers, 54 enlisted men, four US embassy staff, and 10 civilians, including Universal Newsreel cameraman Norman Alley, Movietone News’ Eric Mayell, the \"<nowiki>New York Times'</nowiki>\"s Norman Soong, \"Collier's Weekly\" correspondent Jim Marshall, \"La Stampa\" correspondent Sandro Sandri and \"Corriere della Sera\" correspondent Luigi Barzini Jr.\nOn the morning of the 12th, the Japanese air forces received information that fleeing Chinese forces were in the area in ten large steamers and a large number of junks and that they were between upstream from Nanking. While anchored upstream from Nanking, \"Panay\" and three Standard Oil tankers, \"Mei Ping\", \"Mei An\" and \"Mei Hsia\", came under attack from Japanese naval aircraft. \"Panay\" was hit by two of the eighteen bombs dropped by three Yokosuka B4Y Type-96 bombers and strafed by nine Nakajima A4N Type-95 fighters. \n\nAccording to Lieutenant J.W. Geist, an officer aboard the \"Panay\", \"the day before we told the Japanese army in the area who we were,\" and three American flags were plainly visible on the ship. Planes also machine-gunned small boats taking the wounded ashore, and several additional survivors were wounded. \"The Times\" correspondent Colin MacDonald, who had also been aboard the \"Panay\", saw a Japanese army small boat machine-gun the \"Panay\" as it was sinking in spite of the American flag painted on the side of the ship. Since Japanese planes continued to circle overhead, survivors cowered knee deep in mud in a swamp. \n\nAs a result of the attack, \"Panay\" sank; Storekeeper First Class Charles L. Ensminger, Standard Oil tanker captain Carl H. Carlson and Italian reporter Sandro Sandri were killed, Coxswain Edgar C. Hulsebus died later that night. 43 sailors and five civilians were wounded.\n\nThe three Standard Oil tankers were also bombed and destroyed, and the captain of \"Mei An\" and many Chinese civilian passengers were killed. The vessels had been helping to evacuate the families of Standard Oil's employees and agents from Nanking during the Japanese attack on that city.\n\nTwo newsreel cameramen were aboard during the attack (Norman Alley of Universal News and Eric Mayell of Movietone News); they were able to film part of the attack and, after reaching shore, the sinking of the ship in the middle of the river. Survivors were later taken aboard the American vessel and the British gunboats and . Earlier the same day, a Japanese shore battery had fired on \"Ladybird\".\nThe survivors coped with near freezing nights in inadequate clothing and with no food. It took three days to move the sixteen wounded to the safety of several British and American ships.\n\nThe aftermath of the \"Panay\" sinking was a nervous time for the American ambassador to Japan, Joseph C. Grew. Grew, whose experience in the foreign service spanned over 30 years, \"remembered the \"Maine\",\" the US Navy ship that blew up in Havana Harbor in 1898. The sinking of \"Maine\" had propelled the US into the Spanish–American War, and Grew hoped the sinking of \"Panay\" would not be a similar catalyst for the severance of diplomatic ties and war with Japan.\n\nThe Japanese government took full responsibility for sinking \"Panay\" but continued to maintain that the attack had been unintentional. Chief of Staff of Japanese naval forces in northern China, Vice Admiral Rokuzo Sugiyama, was assigned to make an apology. The formal apology reached Washington, D.C. on Christmas Eve.\n\nAlthough Japanese officials maintained that their pilots never saw any American flags on \"Panay\", a US Navy court of inquiry determined that several US flags were clearly visible on the vessel during the attacks. At the meeting held at the American embassy in Tokyo on 23 December, Japanese officials maintained that one navy airplane had attacked a boat by machine gun for a short period of time and that Japanese army motor boats or launches attack the Chinese steamers escaping upstream on the opposite bank. However, the Japanese navy insisted that the attack had been unintentional. The Japanese government paid an indemnity of $2,214,007.36 to the US on 22 April 1938, officially settling the \"Panay\" incident.\n\nHowever, the presence of American flags, which would have been visible from the air, suggests the attack had not been a mistake, but rather a type of unauthorized action known by the classical Japanese term \"Gekokujō\".\n\nFrom the beginning, the State Department's position was that none of the families of those killed or the sailors or civilians wounded would receive any of the contributions. No office or department of the federal government would accept the money. The State Department also expressed the desire that any necessary arrangements be made promptly. Hull did not wish to keep the Japanese people waiting for a decision on what was to become of the money they donated. A prolonged delay could lead to misunderstanding, especially if a decision was reached months later to return the money to the donors.\n\nThe State Department telegram of 18 December also set forth, at least for the time being, that only the American ambassador in Japan and the American ambassador in China could accept donations related to the \"Panay\" incident. Several American consulates were receiving money, including consulates at Nagoya, Kobe, Nagasaki and Osaka, in Japan; Taipei, Taiwan; Keijo (Seoul), Korea; Dairen, Manchuria; and São Paulo, Brazil. These contributions were eventually forwarded to the ambassador in Tokyo. Grew kept all money received related to the \"Panay\" incident in the embassy safe until the State Department could find a solution.\n\nThe American consulates in Nagasaki forwarded several contributions and translations of letters to the embassy in Tokyo, including ¥50 from a Mr. Ichiro Murakami, identified as a former US Navy pensioner, and another individual who wished to remain anonymous.\n\nThe Navy Cross was presented subsequently to two British naval officers, Vice Admiral Lewis Eyre Crabbe and Lieut. Commander Harry Barlow, for their \"voluntary and unstinted cooperation in assisting with the recovery of the survivors of the U.S.S. Panay.\n\nIn a letter two days later, the consulate in Nagasaki also reported to Grew that on 21 December a small boy from the Shin Kozen Primary School brought in a letter and donation of ¥2 to the consulate and was accompanied by his older brother. The consul enclosed the contribution and both the original and translation of the boy's letter. The letter reads, \"The cold has come. Having heard from my elder brother that the American warship has sunk the other day I feel very sorry. Having been committed without intention beyond doubt, I apologize on behalf of the soldiers. Please forgive. Here is the money I saved. Please hand it to the American sailors injured.\" The letter, addressed \"To the American sailors,\" was signed only, \"One of the pupils of the Shin Kozen.\" The boy did not provide his name in the letter and did not reveal it when visiting the consulate.\n\nA local newspaper, the \"Nagasaki Minyu Shimbun\", published the story of Murakami's donation and that of the schoolboy and included an excerpt of the boy's letter. Arthur F. Tower, the American consul in Nagasaki, informed Ambassador Grew of the article, which had been published on 7 January. Tower also informed Grew that a reporter of another newspaper—the Tokyo and Osaka \"Asahi Shimbun\", had called on him on 23 December to discuss the \"Panay\" contributions. Towers reassured Grew that \"this consulate has not sought to give publicity to the donations received or offered and has furnished information concerning them on two occasions only, when requested.\"\n\nAlthough the consul in Nagasaki was not trying to publicize the donations, the newspaper stories may have increased contributions at his consulate. On 8 January, a Japanese pensioner of the US Navy called in person to make a contribution of ¥5 for the relief of those involved in the \"Panay\" incident. When his contribution was accepted, the former sailor informed the consul that a group of other US pensioners also wished to donate money.\n\nOn 10 January, he visited the consulate again, this time with two representatives of Japanese pensioners of the US Navy who lived in the area. By this time, however, the Nagasaki consulate had received the consulate general's supervisory circular informing them that all \"Panay\"-related contributions were to be made either to the ambassador in China or the ambassador in Japan. The gentlemen attempted to donate money but were informed that the consul could no longer receive contributions, and the men were asked to communicate directly with the American embassy in Tokyo. Soon after the departure of the former US sailors, two Japanese men arrived at the consulate. These gentlemen, representing the Buddhist Association of Nagasaki, also had come to donate money for victims of \"Panay\" and were likewise turned away.\n\nModern historians believe that the attack may have been intentional. According to John Prados, Navy cryptographers had intercepted and decrypted traffic relating to the attacking planes which clearly indicated that they were under orders during the attack and that it had not been a mistake of any kind. This information was not released at the time for obvious secrecy reasons. Writer Nick Sparks believes that the chaos in Nanking created an opportunity for renegade factions within the Japanese army who wanted to force the US into an active conflict so that the Japanese could once and for all drive the US out of China.\n\nFon Huffman, the last survivor of the incident, died in 2008. The last surviving Japanese pilot who participated in the attack was Kaname Harada, who died in 2016.\n\nThe episode has been cited by Philip K. Dick in his novel \"The Man in the High Castle\", depicted in a collectible picture-card of the 1940s, in the series \"Horrors of War\" with the title \"The sinking of the Panay.\"\n\nThe incident features in the novel \"A Winter in China\" by the British writer Douglas Galbraith. It is also described in the historical fiction novel \"\" by Newt Gingrich and William R. Forstchen.\n\nThe Panay incident is an important part of the background in Own Sela's thriller \"An Exchange of Eagles\". In the book, the only son of Max Schroeder, a Military Intelligence Colonel, was killed on board the Panay. Shroeder nurses a deep grudge against President Roosevelt, whom he considers to have sent his son to die in vain. That makes Schroeder willing, in 1940, to contemplate assassinating Roosevelt in order to prevent American soldiers being sent to die in Europe. \n\nThe 2009 film \"John Rabe\" portrays a fictionalized version of the incident.\n\nhttps://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/summer/two-japans-1.html\n\n\n"}
