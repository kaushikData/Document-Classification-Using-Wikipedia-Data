{"id": "4800285", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4800285", "title": "Arrest of Jesus", "text": "Arrest of Jesus\n\nThe arrest of Jesus was a pivotal event in Christianity recorded in the canonical gospels. Jesus, a preacher whom Christians consider to be the Son of God, was arrested by the Temple guards of the Sanhedrin in the Garden of Gethsemane. It occurred shortly after the Last Supper (during which Jesus gave his final sermon), and immediately after the kiss of Judas, which is traditionally said to have been an act of betrayal since Judas made a deal with the chief priests to arrest Jesus. The event ultimately led, in the Gospel accounts, to Jesus' crucifixion.\n\nThe arrest led immediately to his trial before the Sanhedrin, during which they condemned him to death and handed him to Pilate the following morning. In Christian theology, the events from the Last Supper until the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus are referred to as the Passion.\n\nIn the New Testament, all four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. In each Gospel, these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.\n\nAccording to the canonical gospels, after the Last Supper, Jesus and his disciples went out to Gethsemane, a garden located at the edge of the Kidron Valley, thought by scholars to probably have been an olive grove. Once there, he is described as leaving the group so that he can pray privately.\n\nThe synoptics state that Jesus asked God that his burden be taken from him, and requested not to need to undergo the events that he was due to, though giving the final choice to God. Luke states that an angel appeared and strengthened Jesus, who then returned to his disciples. The synoptics state that the three disciples that were with Jesus had fallen asleep, and that Jesus criticized them for failing to stay awake even for an hour, suggesting that they pray so that they could avoid temptation.\n\nAt that point, Judas gave Jesus a kiss, as a pre-arranged sign to those that had accompanied Judas as to who Jesus was. Having been identified, the officers arrested Jesus, although one of Jesus' disciples thought to stop them with a sword, but cut off the ear of one of the arresting officers. The Gospel of John specifies that it had been Simon Peter who had cut off the ear of Malchus, the servant of Caiaphas, the high priest. Luke adds that Jesus healed the wound. John, Matthew, and Luke state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that they do not resist Jesus' arrest. In Matthew, Jesus made the well known statement \"all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword\".\n\nThe account in the Gospel of John differs from that of the synoptics: only in John do Roman soldiers help to carry out the arrest. Judas leads the arresting party to Jesus, but rather than Judas pointing out Jesus, John has Jesus himself, \"knowing all that was to happen to him\", ask them whom they are looking for; when they say \"Jesus of Nazareth\", he replies \"I am he\", at which point all members of the arrest party went backward and fell to the ground.\n\nThe arrest of Jesus and Judas' role in acting as a guide to those arresting him are subsequently referred to by Peter in .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "129602", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=129602", "title": "Awakenings", "text": "Awakenings\n\nAwakenings is a 1990 American drama film based on Oliver Sacks' 1973 memoir of the same title. It tells the story of Malcolm Sayer, who, in 1969, discovered beneficial effects of the drug L-Dopa. He administered it to catatonic patients who survived the 1917–28 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica. Leonard Lowe and the rest of the patients were awakened after decades and have to deal with a new life in a new time. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards.\n\nDirected by Penny Marshall, the film was produced by Walter Parkes and Lawrence Lasker, who first encountered Sacks's book as undergraduates at Yale University and optioned it a few years later. \"Awakenings\" stars Robert De Niro, Robin Williams, Julie Kavner, Ruth Nelson, John Heard, Penelope Ann Miller, and Max von Sydow. The film features a cameo appearance by jazz musician Dexter Gordon (who died before the film's release) and then-unknowns Bradley Whitford, Peter Stormare, and Vincent Pastore.\n\nIn 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the New York City borough of The Bronx. After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917–1928 epidemic of encephalitis lethargica, Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a Ouija board.\n\nAfter attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from Parkinson's disease, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely \"awakens\" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience \"awakenings\" back to reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of facial and body tics are starting to manifest, which Leonard has difficulty controlling.\n\nWhile Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to \"awaken\", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of \"awakening\". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks, and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him, and for this short period of time his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.\n\nSayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the \"awakening\" did not last, another kind — one of learning to appreciate and live life — took place. For example, he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello (Julie Kavner) to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her. The nurses also now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula is shown visiting Leonard. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands, which are on the planchette. \"Let's begin,\" Sayer says.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Awakenings\" began on October 16, 1989 at the functioning Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in Brooklyn, New York and lasted until February 16, 1990. According to Williams, actual patients were used in the filming of the movie. In addition to Kingsboro, sequences were also filmed at the New York Botanical Garden, Julia Richman High School, the Casa Galicia, and Park Slope, Brooklyn.\n\n\"Awakenings\" opened in limited release on December 22, 1990 with an opening weekend gross of $417,076. The film then expanded to a wide release on January 11, 1991, opening in second place behind \"Home Alone\"s ninth weekend, with $8,306,532.\n\nThe film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 88% of 33 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.7/10. Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 74 based on 18 reviews.\n\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, writing,\nOwen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" praised the film's performances, citing,\nOliver Sacks, the author of the memoir on which the film is based, \"was pleased with a great deal of [the film],\" explaining,\nDesson Howe of \"The Washington Post\" felt the film's tragic aspects did not live up to the strength in its humor, saying that\nSimilarly, Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" concluded her review stating,\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including: the Academy Award for Best Picture, the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, and the Academy Award for Best Actor (Robert De Niro). Robin Williams was also nominated at the 48th Golden Globe Awards for Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama.\n\n\n"}

The general satirical opinion of the authors found its expression in current daily politics which was supplemented by partly colored caricatures and drawings. In general the journal's position was nationalistic, independent and moderate. However, its critique led – under the pressure of censorship – to its suspension in 1947.\n\n\n"}

The book, which made di Donato famous, was originally published by \"Esquire Magazine\" as a short story and was expanded into a novel by di Donato.\n\nThe novel was inspired by the death of di Donato's father in a construction accident on Good Friday in 1923. It tells the story of a bricklayer and his struggle to provide a home for his family.\n\nAs indicated by the title, the novel is noted for its rich religious imagery, presented in a largely modernist stream-of-consciousness style. It was adapted into a 1949 motion picture, \"Give Us This Day\" (U.S. title \"Christ in Concrete\") and was directed by Edward Dmytryk.\n\nI. Geremio: Geremio and his coworkers are gruesomely killed on the job when the building they are working on collapses. Geremio is swallowed in concrete, which crushes him to death as it dries. Because this accident occurs on Good Friday, Geremio is the \"Christ in concrete\" of the title.\n\nII. Job: Geremio's pregnant widow, Annunziata, is left with no way to provide for their already-large family. Her brother Luigi promises to help, but soon he himself is injured at work and loses part of his leg. Geremio and Annunziata's oldest son, Paul, tries to find charity from local businesses and from the church, but with no success. He decides to take his father's place as brick-layer, and after a while is accepted by the other workers as having inherited his father's skills; yet, because of his youth, the company pays him only a pittance and Paul overworks himself. In this section, the word \"job\" is treated like a character and often capitalized.\n\nIII. Tenement: Unable to work, Paul remains at home; di Donato uses this section to explore some of the other families in the tenement, including the Olsens, whose daughter Gloria attracts Paul, and the Molovs, Russian Jews whose son Louis befriends Paul after telling him about the death of his older brother back in Russia. Also in this section, Annunziata and Paul visit a psychic, who reassures them that Geremio is watching over and praying for them, and attend the hearing at the Compensation Bureau, which ends indecisively with the construction company blaming the workers for the accident and the insurance company claiming the accident falls outside the bounds of the policies they have with the construction company.\n\nIV. Fiesta: Paul gets a better-paying job as a bricklayer, and later gets a job working on skyscrapers. Luigi comes home from the hospital and eventually marries Cola, providing the fiesta of the title.\n\nV. Annunaziata: The Great Depression hits, and Paul helps his mentor Nazone get work, only to have Nazone fall to his death after a fight with the foreman. Distraught, Paul tells his mother that he no longer believes in God or in the afterlife, a confession that shatters her and for which he spends the final pages asking forgiveness.\n\n\n"}

He served as the first director of the United States Geological Survey from 1879 to 1881. King was noted for his exploration of the Sierra Nevada.\n\nClarence King was the son of James Rivers King and Florence Little King. Clarence's father was part of a family firm engaged in trade with China, which kept him away from home a great deal, and he died in 1848, so Clarence was brought up primarily by his mother. By 1848 his only two siblings had also died.\n\nClarence developed an early interest in outdoor exploration and natural history, which was encouraged by his mother and by Reverend Dr. Roswell Park, head of the Christ Church Hall school in Pomfret, Connecticut that Clarence attended until he was ten. He then attended schools in Boston and New Haven, and at age thirteen was accepted to the prestigious Hartford High School. He was a good student and a versatile athlete, of short stature but unusually strong.\n\nHis mother received an income from the King family business until it met with a series of problems and dissolved in 1857. After a few years of straitened circumstances, during part of which Clarence suffered from a serious depression, his mother married George S. Howland in July 1860. Howland financed Clarence's enrollment in the Sheffield Scientific School affiliated with Yale College in 1860.\n\nAt Yale, King specialized in \"applied chemistry\" and also studied physics and geology. One inspiring teacher was James Dwight Dana, a highly regarded geologist who had participated in a scientific expedition to the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and the west coasts of South and North America. King graduated with a Ph.B. in July 1862. He and several friends borrowed one of Yale's rowboats that summer for a trip along the shores of Lake Champlain and a series of Canadian rivers, then returned to New Haven for the fall regatta.\n\nIn October 1862, on a visit to the home of his former professor George Jarvis Brush, King heard Brush read aloud a letter he had received from William Henry Brewer telling of an ascent of Mount Shasta in California, then believed to be the tallest mountain in the country. King began to read more about geology, attended a lecture by Louis Agassiz, and soon wrote to Brush that he had \"pretty much made up my mind to be a geologist if I can get work in that direction.\" He was also fascinated by descriptions of the Alps by John Tyndall and John Ruskin.\n\nIn late 1862 or early 1863, King moved to New York City to share an apartment with James Terry Gardiner, a close friend from high school and college (who spelled his last name Gardner at the time). They associated with a group of American artists, writers, and architects who were admirers of John Ruskin. In February 1863 King became one of the founders, along with John William Hill, Clarence Cook and others, of the Ruskinian Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, an American group similar to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was elected its first secretary. But he was anxious to see the mountains of the American West, and his friend Jim Gardiner was miserable in law school.\n\nBy May 1863 King, Gardiner, and an acquaintance named William Hyde traveled by railroad to Missouri and then joined a wagon train, which they left at Carson City, Nevada. King and Gardiner soon continued on to California, where King joined the California Geological Survey without pay, in which he worked with William H. Brewer, Josiah D. Whitney and later Gardiner and Richard D. Cotter. In July 1864, King and Cotter made the first ascent of a peak in the Eastern Sierra that King named Mount Tyndall in honor of one of his heroes. From there they discovered several higher peaks, including the one that came to be named Mount Whitney.\n\nIn September 1864, upon the designation by President Abraham Lincoln of the Yosemite Valley area as a permanent public reserve, King and Gardiner were appointed to make a boundary survey around the rim of Yosemite Valley. They returned to the East Coast by way of Nicaragua the following winter. King suffered from several bouts of malaria in the spring and summer of 1865 while Whitney, also in the East, worked on securing funding for further survey projects. King, Gardiner, Whitney, and Whitney's wife sailed back to San Francisco in the fall, where Whitney lined up a survey project for King and Gardiner in the Mojave Desert and Arizona under U.S. Army auspices. They returned to San Francisco in the spring, and King returned to Yosemite in the summer of 1866 to make more field notes for Whitney. When King heard of the death of his stepfather, he and Gardiner resigned from the Whitney survey and once again sailed to New York. They had been developing a plan for an independent survey of the Great Basin region for some time, and in late 1866 King went to Washington to secure funding from Congress for such a survey.\n\nKing made a persuasive argument for how his research would help develop the west. He received federal funding and was named U.S. Geologist of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, commonly known as the Fortieth Parallel Survey, in 1867. He persuaded Gardiner to be his second in command, and they assembled a team that included, among others, Samuel Franklin Emmons, Arnold Hague, A. D. Wilson, the photographer Timothy H. O'Sullivan, and guest artist Gilbert Munger.\n\nOver the next six years King and his team explored areas from eastern California to Wyoming. During that time he also published his famous \"Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada\" (1872). \nWhile King was finishing the 40th Parallel Survey, the western US was abuzz with news of a secret diamond deposit. King and some of his crew tracked down the secret location in northwest Colorado, and exposed it as a fraud, now known as the Diamond hoax of 1872. He became an international celebrity through exposing the hoax.\n\nIn 1878 King published \"Systematic Geology\", numbered Volume 1 of the Report of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, although it appeared later than all but one of the other seven volumes. In this work he narrated the geological history of the West as a mixture of uniformitarianism and catastrophism. This book was well received at the time and has been called \"one of the great scientific works of the late nineteenth century.\"\n\nIn 1879, the US Congress consolidated the number of geological surveys exploring the American West and created the United States Geological Survey. King was chosen as its first director. He took the position with the understanding that it would be temporary, and he resigned after twenty months, having overseen the organization of the new agency with an emphasis on mining geology. He named John Wesley Powell as his successor.\n\nDuring the remaining years of his life King withdrew from the scientific community and attempted to profit from his knowledge of mining geology, but the mining ventures he got involved in were not successful enough to support his expensive tastes in art collecting, travel, and elegant living, and he went heavily into debt. He had a busy social life, with close friendships including Henry Brooks Adams and John Hay, who admired him tremendously. But he suffered from physical ailments and depression.\n\nKing spent his last thirteen years leading a double life. In 1887 or 1888, he met and fell in love with Ada Copeland, an African-American nursemaid (and former slave) from Georgia, who had moved to New York City in the mid-1880s. As miscegenation was strongly discouraged in the nineteenth century (and illegal in many places), King hid his identity from Copeland. Despite his blue eyes and fair complexion, King convinced Copeland that he was an African-American Pullman porter named James Todd. The two entered into a common law marriage in 1888. Throughout the marriage, King never revealed his true identity to Ada, pretending to be Todd, a black railroad worker, when at home, and continuing to work as King, a white geologist, when in the field. Their union produced five children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Their two daughters married white men; their two sons served classified as blacks during World War I. King finally revealed his true identity to Copeland in a letter he wrote to her while on his deathbed in Arizona. King's friends John Hay and Henry Adams supplied funds for the support of Ada and her family after his death.\n\nKing died of tuberculosis in Phoenix, Arizona, and was buried in Newport, Rhode Island. Kings Peak in Utah, Mount Clarence King, and Clarence King Lake at Shastina, California are named in his honor, as is King Peak in Antarctica.\nThe US Geological Survey Headquarters Library in Reston, Virginia, is also known as the Clarence King Library.\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n"}

During its time it was of the most important cities in Río de la Plata government. Major economical activities were cotton, wax and commercial activities; Concepción was a must step in the road between Asunción del Paraguay and San Miguel de Tucumán. Between 1631 and 1632 was attacked by local Indians, who made that local inhabitants leave the city and ran away to Corrientes.\n"}
{"id": "28724147", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=28724147", "title": "Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games", "text": "Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games\n\nA number of concerns and controversies surfaced before the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India, which received widespread media coverage both in India (the host nation) and internationally.\n\nThe Commonwealth Games was severely criticised by several prominent Indian politicians and social activists because billions of dollars have been spent on the sporting event despite the fact that India has one of the world's largest concentration of poor people. Additionally, several other problems related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games have been highlighted by Indian investigative agencies and media outlets; these include – serious corruption by officials of the Games' Organising Committee, delays in the construction of main Games' venues, infrastructural compromise, possibility of a terrorist attack, and exceptionally poor ticket sales before the event.\n\nMiloon Kothari, a leading Indian expert on socio-economic development, remarked that the 2010 Commonwealth Games will create \"a negative financial legacy for the country\" and asked \"when one in three Indians lives below the poverty line and 40% of the hungry live in India, when 46% of India's children and 55% of women are malnourished, does spending billions of dollars on a 12-day sports event build national pride or is it a matter of national shame?\"\n\nOne of the outspoken critics of the Games is Mani Shankar Aiyar, former Indian Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports. In April 2007, Aiyar commented that the Games are \"irrelevant to the common man\" and criticized the Indian government for sanctioning billions of dollars for the Games even though India requires massive investment in social development programs. In July 2010, he remarked that he would be \"unhappy if the Commonwealth Games are successful\".\n\nAzim Premji called the 2010 Commonwealth Games a \"drain on public funds\" and said that hosting the high-expense Games in India is not justified given that the country had more important priorities facing it, such as education, infrastructure and public health.\n\nNearly 400,000 people from three large slum cluster in Delhi have been relocated since 2004. Gautam Bhan, an Indian urban planner with the University of California-Berkeley, said that the 2010 Commonwealth Games have resulted in \"an unprecedented increase in the degree, frequency and scale of indiscriminate evictions without proper resettlement. We haven’t seen these levels of evictions in the last five years since the Emergency.\"\n\nIn response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed for study and statements by civil society groups, a report by the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN) - an arm of the Habitat International Coalition - detailed the social and environmental consequences of the event. It stated that \"no tolerance zones\" for beggars are enforced in Delhi, and the city has arbitrarily arrested homeless citizens under the \"Bombay Prevention of Begging Act 1959\".m\n\nCampaigners in India have accused the organisers of enormous and systematic violations of labour laws at construction sites. Human Rights Law Network reports that independent investigations have discovered more than 70 cases where workers have died in accidents at construction sites since work began. Although official numbers have not been released, it is estimated that over 415,000 contract daily wage workers are working on Games projects. Unskilled workers are paid to per day while skilled workers are paid to INR per day for eight hours of work. Workers also state that they are paid to for 12 hours of work (eight hours plus four hours of overtime). Both these wages contravene the stipulated Delhi state minimum wage of for eight hours of work. Nearly 50 construction workers have died in the past two years while employed on Games projects.\n\nThese represent violations of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Services) Act 1979, and the constitutionally enshrined fundamental rights per the 1982 Supreme Court of India judgement on Asiad workers. The public have been banned from the camps where workers live and work – a situation which human rights campaigners say prevents the garnering of information regarding labour conditions and number of workers.\n\nThere have been documented instances of the presence of young children at hazardous construction sites, due to a lack of child care facilities for women workers living and working in the labour camp style work sites. Furthermore, workers on the site of the main Commonwealth stadium have reportedly been issued with hard hats, yet most work in open-toed sandals and live in cramped tin tenements in which illnesses are rife. The High Court of Delhi is presently hearing a public interest petition relating to employers not paying employees for overtime and it has appointed a four-member committee to submit a report on the alleged violations of workers rights.\n\nDuring the construction of the Games Village, there was controversy over financial mismanagement, profiteering by the Delhi Development Authority and private real estate companies, and inhumane working conditions.\n\nCNN has broadcast evidence showing children, as young as seven, being used in the construction of the game venues. According to Siddharth Kara, who provided CNN with the evidence, he documented 14 cases of child labor within a few days. In reply to a question whether it could have been just a case of kids being present at the construction site along with their parents, he replied: \"It's not just kids playing in the dirt or using a hammer as a toy.\" He further stated about the kids: \"They're told to do the work and they just do the work. They don't know that they should be in school or that they should be playing.\"\n\nEven though the New Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit claimed that nobody had approached her, according to CNN, they had tried to contact her as far back as 23 July 2010. In spite of repeated attempts, according to them, no official reply was ever made.\n\nMitu Sengupta, a professor of politics at Ryerson University, Canada, points out that there is a \"tradition of using 'urban spectacles' such as the Olympics and World’s Fairs to enhance a city’s global recognition, image and status, and to push through controversial policy reforms that might otherwise linger in the pending file for years (it is easier to undercut local opposition under the pressure of a fixed deadline and the international spotlight).” She writes that the reforms involved are often \"the invention of an affluent, globally connected minority that is relatively detached from local conditions and the local population\". The 2010 Commonwealth Games, she says, are being used to invigorate an elite-driven program of urban transformation\" that centers on privatization, securitization, and the construction of \"monuments to vanity\". Sengupta expands upon this argument in a subsequent article in Z Magazine Amita Baviskar, a professor of sociology at the Institute of Economic Growth, University of Delhi, makes a similar argument, on how mega-events, like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, are used to advance narrow agendas of urban reform that cater to the middle class and rich. She focuses on how, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games, the city's slums were bulldozed in order to make room for shopping malls and expensive real estate.\n\nThere has been a boom in the number of young girls, mostly from impoverished parts of India, coming to Delhi after being offered jobs by disguised criminals, only to be taken prisoner and forced into sex slavery. The number of victims is believed to be in the hundreds. Many brothels have been running English courses for sex workers and upgrading their facilities in anticipation of a business upturn during the games. Overseas prostitutes are also expected to come as tourists and ply their trade. One anti-trafficking NGO has claimed that there are reports of 40,000 women being brought in from northeastern India alone. A spokesperson said that recruits from that part of India were favoured because of their lighter skin. It has been reported that over 3,000 bar girls in Mumbai have stopped going to work; this has been blamed on an exodus to Delhi for the Commonwealth Games.\n\nOn 28 July 2010, the Central Vigilance Commission, an Indian government body created to address governmental corruption, released a report showing irregularities in up to 14 CWG projects. As per official reports, in total 129 works in 71 organisations have been inspected. The detailed preliminary findings included the award of work contracts at higher prices, poor quality assurance and management, and work contracts awarded to ineligible agencies.\n\nThere are also allegations of widespread corruption in various aspects of organising the games including procurement and awarding contracts for constructing the game venues. The Commonwealth Games Organising Committee on 5 August 2010 suspended joint director T S Darbari and M Jayachandran following the report of the three-member panel which was probing the financial irregularities related to the Queen's Baton Relay.\n\nAlso, Organising Committee treasurer Anil Khanna resigned from the post in the wake of allegations that his son's firm had secured a contract for laying synthetic courts at a tennis stadium. The GlobalPost news agency reports that scandals have come to light, such as \"shadowy off-shore firms, forged emails, inexplicable payments to bogus companies and inflated bills – for every purchase from toilet paper to treadmills.\" Among the alleged corruption and defrauding of the games budget, toilet paper rolls valued at $2 were costed at $80, $2 soap dispensers at $60, $98 mirrors at $220, $11,830 altitude training simulators at $250,190.\n\nIn September 2009, CGF chief Mike Fennell reported that the games were at risk of falling behind schedule and that it was \"reasonable to conclude that the current situation poses a serious risk to the Commonwealth Games in 2010\". A report by the Indian Government released several months prior found that construction work on 13 out of the 19 sports venues was behind schedule.\n\nThe Chief of the Indian Olympic Association shri Narendra Modi has also expressed his concerns regarding the current state of affairs. Singh has called for the revamp of the Organising Committee commenting that India now has to \"retrieve the games\". Other Indian officials have also expressed dismay at the ongoing delays but they have stated that they are confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.\n\nAs the Times of India reports, all CWG projects were to be completed by May 2009 and the last year should have been kept for trial runs. The newspaper further reports that the first stadium was handed over for trial runs in July 2010 only. To put the delays in perspective, Beijing National Stadium was completed much ahead of schedule for the 2008 Summer Olympics, while the venues for 2012 Summer Olympics in London are scheduled to be delivered one year before the games and the construction of the venues is on track.\n\nIn August 2010, the Cabinet Secretariat took a decision to appoint 10 officers of the rank of Joint and Additional Secretaries to oversee the progress of the construction of stadiums. Each officer is allocated a stadium and given the responsibility to ensure that the work completes in time for the games.\n\nAround 10,000 of the 22,000 selected volunteers quit, less than a week before the event. This has been blamed on a lack of training for personnel, or dissatisfaction with assignments. There are reports that some who have quit have not returned their uniforms.\n\nThe start of the Games saw extremely poor ticket sales, with many venues near empty. In a press conference, organising chairman Suresh Kalmadi admitted that there were problems, and blamed empty venues on ticket booths not being set up outside stadiums. Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell admitted that many venues had been nearly empty on the opening day of the Games, saying \"A number of venues do not have lots of spectators [...] one area which causes us concern\". On the second day of competition, less than 100 people filled the hockey venue–the 19,000-seat MDC Stadium. Less than 20 people watched the first tennis match of the tournament in the 5,000-seat tennis stadium, and just 58 fans watched the netball opening match.\n\nOne Indian competitor tried to buy tickets for relatives online, only to be informed by the website that tickets were sold out. When he arrived to compete, he found the venue to be empty.\n\nThe streets of Delhi were deserted for the cycling road races and walking event. \n\nAt the opening ceremony, the chairman of the organising committee, Suresh Kalmadi, faced embarrassment, when he was booed by spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 60,000 spectators. Kalmadi came under further strain when he \"thanked\" the late Princess Diana for attending the opening ceremony of the games. The chairman made the blunder at a press conference saying 'Yes, Princess Diana was there,’ after which he immediately corrected himself by saying 'Prince Charles and (Camilla) the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nThe Australian Commonwealth contingent expressed frustration over the opening ceremony, in which there were claims that the athletes and delegation support staff were \"treated like cattle\" and subjected to \"disgraceful\" and unbearable conditions. Australia's chef de mission Steve Moneghetti complained about the athletes being trapped in \"absolute cauldron conditions\" under the main stadium before marching for the opening ceremony. The Australians were stuck in a tunnel, where Moneghetti described the temperature as exceeding due to a lack of airconditioning and ventilation. When attempting to move out, the Australian delegation was stopped by staff. When the contestants were finally able to move out into the arena, they were described as being emotionally affected.\n\nAfrican countries have complained that they are getting second-class treatment from the Games organisers, in spite of them offering India a hand in the preparation of the Games. They have alleged that accommodation given to them was inferior compared to the accommodation provided to the Australian and New Zealand teams. They went on to state that India was complaining about being victims of racial bias in the reporting of the Games; while simultaneously perpetrating the same kind of racism against the African countries.\n\nThe Delhi Airport Metro Express built by Reliance Infrastructure and CAF Beasain missed its deadline of 31 July 2010 and the private consortium was fined Rs 112.5 million.\n\nLess than two weeks before the opening ceremony, Fennell wrote to the Indian cabinet secretary, urging action in response to the village being \"seriously compromised.\" He said that though team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were \"shocked\" by the state of the accommodation. \"The village is the cornerstone of any Games and the athletes deserve the best possible environment to prepare for their competition.\" The BBC published photographs of the village taken two days before 23 September showing unfinished living quarters.\n\nNew Zealand, Canada, Scotland and Northern Ireland have expressed concern about unliveable conditions. The Times of India newspaper reports that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted a photograph of a dog defecating on a bed in the games village. Hooper said that there was \"excrement in places it shouldn't be\" in the athletes' quarters and that members of visiting delegations had to help clean up the unsanitary things. The BBC released images of bathrooms with brown-coloured paan stains on the walls and floor, liquids on the floor, and brown paw prints on athletes' beds. Lalit Bhanot, the secretary general of the Organising Committee, rejected the complaint that sanitation was poor by saying that, due to cultural differences, there are different standards about cleanliness in India and the western world, a statement for which he was widely ridiculed in Indian and international media. Bhanot went on to say of the athletes' village that, \"This is a world-class village, probably one of the best ever.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan also made reservations over the condition of the athletes' village and asked for an alternate accommodation to be made available to its contingent while preparation was still in progress. The Pakistan Olympic Association president Syed Arif Hasan remarked: \"We want the CGF to ensure that the athletes' village is in good condition. Athletes cannot stay at a substandard place.\" Hasan however added that there were no doubts over Pakistan’s participation and the contingent would leave as planned.\n\nOn the other hand, England's Chef de mission Craig Hunter praised the Games Village, remarking that \"the Commonwealth Games Village here [in New Delhi] is better than the Beijing Olympics\". He added that the arrangements at the Games Village is much better than that at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nCanada's sports minister also supported the Games, saying that big events always face issues, and the media often exaggerates them, as Canada found during the Vancouver Winter Olympics. He added that \"We are coming in full force.\"\n\nOn the first night of swimming, debris landed in the swimming pool, causing delays ahead of a race. It is believed that part of the ceiling or its paint had fallen off.\n\nBefore the last night of swimming finals, the filtration system broke down and the pool was turbid and murky during the warmup session and the finals; it was described as the least clear ever seen for a swimming competition. A disproportionate number of swimmers fell ill with intestinal complaints, leading to concerns over the cleanliness and sanitation of the pool.\nEarly suspicions rested on the quality of water in the swimming pools of the SPM Complex, but other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness. Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the \"chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote\" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village. He suggested that it could be a common case of Traveler's diarrhea (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer Rebecca Adlington said that the water quality was absolutely fine.\n\nAfter the opening ceremony, the ground at the athletics arena was damaged, and the grass infield and the track was still being re-laid two hours before competition started.\n\nAn Indian newspaper during the games reported that used condoms flushed down the toilets in the athlete's village had caused some drains to become blocked, necessitating action by plumbers to clear the pipes.\n\nAustralian athletes have been accused of vandalizing the towers of the athletes' village they were staying in by breaking furniture and electrical fittings. Delhi Police did not press the case after the Organizing Committee refused to file a complaint while Indian external affairs minister SM Krishna dismissed it as a one-off incident.\n\nA washing machine was hurled from the eighth floor of the same tower. Nobody on the ground was hit, but it is unclear who the culprit was. Indian newspapers have reported that the Australian Commonwealth Games Authority agreed to pay for the damages and have apologised for the incident. The Australian High Commissioner rejected the claim, stating that the incident was the result of partying and celebrations. Later comments by Australian officials have contradicted claims by Lalit Bhanot that they had admitted responsibility. Perry Crosswhite said that it was still unclear if athletes from other nations present in the tower at the time had been responsible.\n\nSmall monkeys roam Delhi's streets and prefer heavily urbanized areas with plenty of living space among buildings. They cannot be killed because many Indians see them as sacred so instead a larger, domesticated monkey, the langur, is brought in to scare away the smaller monkeys.\n\nOn the second day of the games, three Ugandan officials were injured by a malfunctioning security barrier at the games' village, and a senior official from that country raised allegations of discrimination by Indian officials. Uganda's sports minister lashed out at Indian officials and demanded an apology for the accident. The officials had cuts and bruises and were hospitalized overnight for observation. The chairman of the Games' Organising Committee, Suresh Kalmadi, apologized to the Ugandan High Commissioner to India for the freak car accident.\n\nOn 21 September 2010, a footbridge under construction for the Games near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium collapsed, injuring at least 23 people, mainly workers, underscoring fears of poor workmanship. Commenting on the incident, Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dikshit controversially remarked that the footbridge was only meant for spectators and not for athletes. Following the collapse, Fennell expressed concern that conditions at the Games Village, which had \"shocked the majority\", would seriously compromise the entire event. The company that was building the foot bridge, P&R Infraprojects, was subsequently blacklisted by the Delhi Government and was not allowed to get government contracts.\n\nReportedly, progress was still slow and four or five accommodation towers built by Emaar at the Games village were unfinished, lacking facilities such as wireless internet, fitted toilets and plumbing. In addition, rubble, unused masonry and discarded bricks littered the unfinished gardens. According to sports historian Boria Majumdar, author of the \"Sellotape Legacy: Delhi and the Commonwealth Games\", India \"may have to pull a miracle.\" The father of Australian track cyclist Kaarle McCulloch visited his daughter at the Olympic village. A builder in Australia, Grahame McCulloch criticised the structural soundness of the village; he said \"those buildings are the dodgiest things I have ever seen...so substandard\". He told his daughter not to use the balcony, fearing that it was collapsible.\n\nOn 22 September 2010, part of the drop ceiling of the new Commonwealth Games weightlifting venue in New Delhi collapsed.\n\nIndian bantamweight boxer Akhil Kumar's bed in the Games village collapsed when he sat on it. \"I sat down on my bed to rest but suddenly it gave way. After that I noticed that part of it has no plywood\", he said\n\nOn 27 September 2010, a South African athlete reported that a snake was present in his room in the Games Village. A day earlier, animal authorities had to be called in to evacuate a king cobra from the tennis venue.\n\nOn 7 October, a large scoreboard crashed to the ground at the rugby venue when a supporting chain snapped. The games however were due to start a week later so no major repercussions were experienced.\n\nFollowing the 2008 Mumbai attacks, some athletes and their representative bodies expressed security fears during the games. In April 2010, during the Indian Premier League, two low intensity bombs went off outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. Although there were no casualties, this postponed the start of the game by an hour. Following this attack, foreign cricketers like Kevin Pietersen expressed fears for their safety and questions were raised regarding the safety of athletes during the Commonwealth Games . The UK and Canada also warned about potential attacks on commercial targets in Delhi ahead of the games.\n\nOn 19 September 2010, unknown gunmen on a motorbike opened fire with an automatic pistol on a tourist bus outside the Jama Masjid mosque in Delhi. The attacks, which came a fortnight before the start of the games, injured two Taiwanese tourists. Two hours later, a Maruti car exploded in the vicinity, reportedly from a deliberate low-intensity pressure cooker bomb which had been assembled inside. No fatalities or major damages were reported. The incidents, which were purportedly claimed by the Indian Mujahideen, provoked fears about lack of security in the city for the upcoming games. However, police in Delhi initially denied the role of any organised terror group and instead blamed the attacks on \"disgruntled youths and local criminal gangs.\" Officials suggested that a possible motive of the strike was to instill fear in people ahead of the Commonwealth Games.\n\nThe heaviest monsoon rains in 15 years, along with large quantities of standing water on CWG construction sites as well as in tanks and ponds, raised concerns over increased levels of mosquito-borne disease in Delhi. In the run-up to the games it was reported that 65-70 cases of dengue fever were being diagnosed each day in the city, with the number of cases \"likely to hit the 3,000 mark\" by the opening on 3 October.\n\nMany swimmers were reported to have fallen ill. Initially, concerns were raised over the quality of water in the swimming pools of the SPM Complex. It was said that more than 20 percent of the English team's swimmers – about eight to 10 competitors – had been struck down with a stomach virus. The Australian team also reported that at least six of its swimmers had been sick, including Andrew Lauterstein, who had to withdraw from the 50-meter butterfly. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell said officials would conduct tests to make sure the pools were not the source of the illness. \"If there is something unsafe, you cannot swim in that water. It is a matter we have to deal with a great deal of urgency,\" he said.\n\nHowever, other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness. Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the \"chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote\" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village. He suggested that it could be a common case of Traveler's diarhoea (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer Rebecca Adlington said that the water quality was absolutely fine.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Dani Samuels, the women's world discus champion, because \"[her] safety [was] more important to them than a medal,\" Australia's Minister for Sport, Mark Arbib, said CWG officials expected more competitors to follow suit.\n\nThe Scottish team's departure of its first 41 boxers, rugby players, wrestlers and support staff was delayed for 48 hours, and the Welsh team set a deadline of 22 September to receive reassurances that the venues would be fit for purpose. The first batch of English athletes, which included a lawn bowls team and a men's hockey squad, said the organisers were not making nearly enough progress just a day before they were to leave. \"The Guardian\" suggested a mass walkout remained an option with the \"point of no return\" less than a week before the scheduled start; they claimed the \"main competing countries would be likely to act in concert.\" They also suggested the games were on the verge of \"descending into farce.\"\n\nMichael Cavanagh, the chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said a decision to stay away would be a joint one, as he insisted a possible knock on effects for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow would not be a factor. He said \"In terms of withdrawal we don't see this as simply a Team Scotland decision, any decision to withdraw we would see as being a collective decision amongst the countries who are already there and already concerned. We can't allow ourselves to be influenced by thoughts of how it may impact on 2014, not when we have something as important as the safety of our athletes to consider.\" Phillips Idowu, the world triple jump champion, also withdrew from the Games.\n\nAmidst allegations of blatant corruption, shoddy construction work at venues and security concerns for participating athletes, the 2010 Commonwealth Games have faced numerous boycott calls from individuals in India, England and Australia.\n\nWithin India, there were calls for boycott. Other celebrities who followed Aiyar's comments in expressing a call for boycott include former Indian cricket captain and spin bowler Bishan Singh Bedi and bestselling Indian author Chetan Bhagat.\nBedi said the \"CWG organisers have taken the country for a ride\" and urged international athletes to boycott the \"embarrassing\" Delhi games. Bhagat, who is considered a youth icon in India with a huge fan following, called the Commonwealth games the \"biggest and most blatant exercise in mass corruption since the country won independence six decades ago.\" Bhagat, who has sold more than 4 million books in India, also urged his readers to boycott the games event and not to watch them on TV, thereby using the \"golden chance\" to \"put the corrupt and insensitive government to shame.\"\n\nThe Jat community seeking reservation under the OBC quota have also planned to use the Commonwealth games as a platform and force the Indian government to relent to their needs.\n\nOther countries also threatened to boycott the games. Considering the potential impact of a terror threat and other security concerns, rumors arose about a boycott of the Delhi Commonwealth Games by major participating nations including Scotland, England and New Zealand. However, the rumors were soon put to rest by Commonwealth games committees in each of these countries who expressed a general level of satisfaction with the security arrangements.\n\nAustralian quadruple Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Dawn Fraser called for Australia to boycott the games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which unfolded in the Munich Olympics of 1972. Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' \"word for providing security should not be taken at its face value.\" However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Organising Committee was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event. John Coates, Australia's Olympic chief, came down hard on the organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. \"I don't think it is a cultural thing. When you agree to host [the Games], you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. The Games shouldn't have been awarded to Delhi in hindsight.\"\n\nA number of athletes withdrew from the Games, for reasons related and non-related to the state of affairs in the days leading up to the event. Jamaican world record holder Usain Bolt and his predecessor Asafa Powell pulled out of the event citing the timing of the Games as a major reason for their decisions to stay away. Olympic cyclist champion Geraint Thomas pulled out for fear of contracting dengue fever. Other notable athletes who have announced their non-attendance include Paula Radcliffe, Jessica Ennis, Jennifer Meadows, Natasha Danvers, Chris Hoy, Bradley Wiggins, Victoria Pendleton and Beth Tweddle.\n\nPrior to the Games, four wrestlers, a shot-putter and two swimmers who were all part of India's Games squad tested positive for methylhexaneamine. Four others, who were not picked for the Games in the Indian capital, also failed drug tests conducted at the various training camps across the country.\n\nOludamola Osayomi, the winner of the women's 100-metre sprint event, was reported to have tested positive for a \"banned substance\" which was later revealed to be the stimulant methylhexaneamine. Another Nigerian athlete, hurdler Samuel Okon who placed sixth in the 110 metres hurdles, was reported to have tested positive for the same drug.\n\nIn July 2011, three of the four women from India's gold-medal winning 400-metre-relay team tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Two of the racers, Sini Jose and Jauna Murmu, tested positive for the anabolic steroid methandienone, and Tiana Mary Thomas tested positive for epi-methandienone.\n\nWhile the audience's behaviour at the archery event provoked criticism from the English team, the silver medallist, Alison Williamson, praised it on the other hand. Earlier reports held that the English team was upset because the loud chant of the crowd during the women's recurve event had distracted the archers. In an action condemned in the Indian media, an English archery official allegedly abused an Indian coach, telling him to \"f*** off.\" The comment came after the Indian team registered a one-point win over England to claim the gold medal. The Indian archery head coach, Limba Ram, walked over to shake hands with officials of the rival team. In response, an English official showed his elbow in a gesture before uttering the remarks. Britain's archery team leader said she was unaware of the incident and added, \"[the Indian coach] must find out whether the person was one among us. If he was not wearing a red jersey, he would not be part of the side. I will speak to the Indian coach about it.\" Limba Ram said that he failed to identify the person as he had chosen to ignore the one-off incident. There have also been accusations that Ram was called a monkey on two different occasions by an English official.\n\nDuring the Final of the Women’s 100m sprint final, a controversy was caused by the eventual disqualification of Sally Pearson of Australia. She had won the race on the third attempted start after one start was delayed because of excessive crowd noise and the second due to a false start by Laura Turner of England. Pearson was disqualified because she was deemed to have false-started in the second attempted restart along with Turner. This was as a direct result of a protest lodged by Team England. The controversy was caused as only Turner was disqualified from the race during the race because of a false start and not Pearson. Turner ran the race under protest. Pearson and other athletes were not informed of the protest until four hours after the race, as they were waiting to begin the medal presentation for the race. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell called Pearson's treatment \"unsatisfactory\" and that the whole situation was caused by an \"unacceptable communications blunder\".\n\nDuring the weigh-in for the boxing competition, the scales were giving inaccurate readings with athletes recording higher body weights on the official scales. The scales were deemed to be broken and the weigh-in was delayed 24 hours to find and calibrate new scales. The initial wrong measurements led to angry shouting between coaches, athletes and organisers. During the boxing competition there have been claims made by various teams including England and Botswana that jabs were not being scored by judges. This was attributed to the removal of a white scoring zone placed on the boxers gloves which is usually present in amateur boxing events. The BBC commentating team also claimed there to be a bias in judges scores towards Indian competitors.\n\nDuring the final of the Men’s Keirin, Malaysian Azizulhasni Awang was disqualified for aggressive interference when he forced his way past two competitors. Race winner Josiah Ng said he was \"mystified\" over Awang's disqualification. In the semi-final round of the keirin, Australia's Shane Perkins was disqualified for dangerous riding with the official reason not being made clear. Perkins subsequently won the classification race and was described by Chris Boardman from the BBC to \"have aimed an angry V-sign at officials\"; he gestured to the judges with his index and middle finger held together. No subsequent action was taken against Perkins who later said, \"the officials need to go back to school\", referencing poor decisions he felt had been made in the sprint and keirin events.\n\nOn another occasion, South African swimmer Roland Schoeman came under criticism when he referred to the crowd at the swimming as \"going on like monkeys\" in a post-race poolside interview. Schoeman's remarks came after he narrowly avoided being disqualified as he and England's Simon Burnett fell in at the start of the 50m freestyle when distracted by the crowd noise. The swimming has been persistently affected by Indian spectators ignoring etiquette and shouting out while the competitors were preparing for the start. His comment was regarded as possibly being a racial ethnic slur, although he later said that the word was commonly used in South Africa to refer to mischievous behaviour. At an official press conference, organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot took the complaints about monkeys literally. Not being aware of the complaints, Bhanot felt Delhi's wildlife was at issue: \"We know especially at the swimming pool there are a lot of monkeys and we have made efforts to keep them away from the swimming pool.\"\n\nAustralian wrestler Hassene Fkiri was ejected from the 96 kg Greco-Roman competition and stripped of the silver medal after making an obscene gesture at the international FILA judges during the final. According to an Australian official, Fkiri was furious at his Indian rival Anil Kumar, who he accused of breaking the rules a number of times in the first period by holding Fkiri around the neck and head with two hands. The Australian received his first warning after he made a comment to the referee as he walked off the mat at the end of the two-minute period; when Kumar repeated the same move in the next round, Fkiri headbutted him and was issued a second warning. He then proceeded to swing his arms uncontrollably afterwards, which resulted in his third warning and eventual disqualification. After losing, Fkiri refused to shake hands with the victor.\n\nResponding to media concerns, the organisers said there were 48 hours to save the Games after warnings of a pull out.\n\nNumerous Bollywood actors also expressed their dismay at the state of the Games.\n\nFour days before the start of the games, tickets for the opening, closing ceremonies, and the 100 m athletics were still not sold out.\n\nThe Sydney Morning Herald wrote that despite Kalmadi's \"blind optimism\", the games were not going to be the best ever. Instead, it wrote that it was \"probably the most interesting.\"\n\nThe opening ceremony played a key role in improving the image of the Games. As athletes arrived and competitions started, many earlier critics changed their view. The Australian Sports Minister said that India could now aim for the Olympics, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid. As the Games concluded, many observers remarked that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending. Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.\n\nWithin India, the Games saw criticism due to the Games' origins as a celebration of the British Empire, with Arindam Chaudhuri arguing for India's disassociation from the \"slavish games\" which he viewed as a \"celebration of racial discrimination, colonialism [and] imperialism\".\n\nMani Shankar Aiyar, a senior member of the ruling Indian National Congress party and former Minister of Youth and Sports Affairs was an early whistleblower from the Indian Union Cabinet who expressed concern over extensive delays in preparation leading to unplanned expenses which he said, could have been utilized for \"ensuring a better sporting future for Indian children by providing them sports training\". Aiyar also said that he would be \"unhappy\" if the Games were a success and wished for the \"Commonwealth Games to be spoiled.\"\n\nAiyar's frank media admission proved a public embarrassment for Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi who labelled him \"anti national\" for wishing that the Commonwealth Games are \"spoilt.\" Kalmadi's remark received extensive criticism in Indian media.\n\nAiyar also told an Australian TV channel that India is \"probably the poorest country of the Commonwealth\". Bangladesh, among other countries, has a lower GDP per capita/purchasing power parity.\n\nThe day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organizing Committee (OC). The probe committee was led by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India VK Shunglu. This probe was in addition to the Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate, and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) investigations already underway. The Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given \"\"severe and exemplary\" punishment\" after the Games. The committee was given three months time to submit its report.\n\nA total of 53 corruption cases were being examined by the CVC. As of September 2012, 28 of them were still in different stages of investigation, 13 were referred to CBI for further investigation and 12 were closed.\n\nThis case relates to allegations of corruption in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm\nOn 25 April 2011, CBI arrested former CWG Organising Committee (OC) chairman Suresh Kalmadi in the Timing-Scoring-Result (TSR) case. He was arrested under Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.\n\nOn 20 May 2011, CBI filed the first chargesheet in a special CBI court against Kalmadi. The CBI alleged that he was the \"main accused\" in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm. The chargesheet said, \"Kalmadi is the main accused as he was the person with all supreme powers. He had the supreme over-riding powers in the Organising Committee of the CWG, 2010.\" In addition to Kalmadi, the CBI named two companies and eight persons including OC former Secretary General Lalit Bhanot and former Director General VK Verma as accused.\n\nThe accused were charged under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code sections dealing with criminal conspiracy, forging documents and using fake documents as genuine, Section 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\nAccording to the charge sheet, the accused allegedly awarded the lucrative contract to the Swiss firm to install a TSR system for the Commonwealth Games at an excessive cost, causing a loss of over to the exchequer. The investigation revealed that officials of the OC had conspired with private persons for awarding the contract at an excessive net cost of about as compared to a net bid of Spain-based company for approximately . This resulted in a loss of about by wrongly eliminating all competitors of Swiss-based company. Two bids were received for TSR contract from Swiss Timing and MSL Spain and they were opened on 4 November 2009. However, much before that, on 12 October 2009, Kalmadi and Verma had announced that the contract would be awarded to Swiss Timing.\n\nOn 4 February 2013, the court of special CBI judge Ravinder Kaur found sufficient prima facie evidence and ordered framing of charges against all the accused. The charges framed were: cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing a loss of over Rs 900 million under the Prevention of Corruption Act. As the accused pleaded not guilty, the court ordered that daily Criminal trial (for 5 days a week) will begin from 20 February.\n\nThe QBR event was held on 29 October 2009. The allegation was that, the Organising Committee (OC) awarded the work of transportation in QBR event to AM Car and Van Hire Ltd at excessively high rates without following a standard tender process.\n\nAfter completing investigations, CBI filed its second charge-sheet (after the charge-sheet in TSR case) in a special CBI court in Delhi. The CBI named OC officials T S Darbari, Sanjay Mohindroo, Jeychandran and London-based businessman Ashish Patel and his two companies AM Car n Van Hire and AM Films. The chargesheet alleged that OC members conspired to award contracts of local transportation and others to Patel's companies at excessive rates during the event held in London in 2009.\n\nThe accused were charged under Indian Penal Code sections relating to criminal conspiracy to cheat and forgery along with violations of Prevention of Corruption Act.\n\nA Swiss company was awarded a contract of over for providing venue development support services to the Organising Committee (OC). However, it was alleged that Prime Minister appointed VK Shunglu Committee found serious cases of forgery and irregularity with the contract. The committee said that, \"Undue pressure was brought within the OC for engaging the company for the contract\" and recommended that CBI or ED should take up the case for appropriate action.\n\nBased on Shunglu Committee's findings, CBI registered an FIR against Suresh Kalmadi, Lalit Bhanot and AK Mattoo on 23 August 2012.\n\nOn 23 March 2014, the Hindustan Times reported that \"...the investigation into the alleged irregularities committed is stumbling with the CBI having closed its FIR related to grant of two contracts to a Swiss firm for lack of evidence.\"\nCBI sources revealed in July 2012 that the probe against alleged corruption in construction of Barapullah Flyover and grant of Bail-out Package to EMAAR MGF is likely to be closed in the absence of substantiating evidence.\n\n"}

They can potentially be fatal.\n\nFollowing a 1984 study on \"Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts\", exaggerated claims spread concerning the number of deaths by falling coconuts. Falling coconuts, according to urban legend, kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide. This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of shark-caused deaths per year, which is around five.\n\nConcern about the risk of fatality due to gravity's pull on coconuts led local officials in Queensland, Australia to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002. One newspaper dubbed coconuts \"the killer fruit.\" Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s. Coconuts also played a lethal role in the South Pacific during World War II. According to published accounts, Japanese forces weaponized the tropical fruit by turning them into \"coconut bombs\" filled with acid and a hand grenade.\n\nCoconut fruit comes from the coconut palm (C\"ocos nucifera)\" which can grow up to tall, with pinnate leaves long, and pinnae 60–90 cm long. Older leaves will break away cleanly from the tree leaving a smooth trunk. While a mature and thriving tree can yield up to 75 fruits per year, it is more common to get fewer than 30. A full-sized coconut weighs about . Coconut palms are cultivated in more than 80 countries of the world, with a total nut production of 61 million tonnes per year.\n\nConcerns about death by coconut have been reported extensively in mainstream media sources. Such reports include:\n\nDocumented instances of death by coconut include the following:\n\nWhile the typical form of death by coconut is by trauma resulting from a coconut falling from a tree under the force of gravity, variations on the phenomenon have also been reported.\n\nOne of the most unusual variations occurred in India in the 1930s. Newspapers across the world reported that a schoolboy in India had been killed by a \"magic\" or \"enchanted\" coconut. In an effort to determine who had taken a book from a classroom, an elementary school teacher at Harnahalli required each of his students to touch a coconut bearing a namam, a religious symbol. The teacher claimed that the one who took the book would face \"divine wrath\" upon touching the coconut. One student resisted, but was forced to touch the coconut. He reportedly contracted a high fever, fell into delirium, and died within an hour.\n\nIn April 1983, a coconut was cited as the cause of death for a female goose-beaked whale. The husk from a coconut became lodged in its intestine, and the whale beached itself on a sandbar at Siesta Key, Florida.\n\nIn May 1997, a report of death by coconut oil was published. The production line manager at a factory in Kiev, Ukraine, drowned in a vat of coconut oil. His body was discovered after he was reported as missing, and police were investigating to determine whether he fell or was pushed into the coconut oil.\n\nIn December 1923, a New Castle, Pennsylvania, man was killed while trying to crack open a coconut with the butt end of a loaded revolver. The gun discharged, and the man was shot in the abdomen.\n\nOther occurrences involve coconuts being used as deadly weapons. These include:\n\nThere have also been reports of deaths resulting from the collapse of coconut palm trees. These include:\n\nOther reports credit the strength of the coconut palm trees with saving the lives of persons who have been tied to the trees for safety during high wind or tsunami events.\n\nDeaths and injuries resulting from falling coconuts have been the subject of several legal proceedings that have been covered in the media.\n\nIn 1956, the City of Miami paid $300 to a woman after a coconut fell from a city-owned tree and struck her in the foot. In justifying the award, the city attorney explained that the city was allegedly on notice of the danger, because \"a reasonable man would assume it was about to fall when it turns brown.\"\n\nIn 1977, a jury in Hawaii awarded $39,000 to a police officer who was struck by a falling coconut. The officer was hit in the head while removing fronds from a public sidewalk in Lahaina. The property owner was sued for failing to maintain the trees.\n\nThe American poet Frederick Seidel wrote a poem titled \"Coconut\", which included the following lines:A coconut can fall and hit you on the head,<br>And if it falls from high enough can kind of knock you dead<br>Dead beneath the coconut palms, that's the life for me!\n\nOn their 1995 CD \"Makin' A Mess\", the writing/singing team of Bob Gibson and Shel Silverstein included a song on this subject, entitled \"Killed By A Coconut\", which humorously describes a series of men and their fatal encounters with coconuts.\n\nFalling coconut injuries were featured in the American television series \"Gilligan's Island\". A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut hit him in the nose. Actor Bob Denver explained the success of the series as follows: \"Little kids seem to love it. It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut.\" When Denver died, the show's creator Sherwood Schwartz said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: \"A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where all you have to do is react to a falling coconut.\" In the film Cast Away, the stranded character played by Tom Hanks is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.\n\nIn March 2006, \"Newsweek\" ran a satirical article on former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, stating he testified that he had sustained amnesia after being struck in the head by a falling coconut and as a result of the injury, was unable to recall the events that occurred during his time at Enron.\n\nWhen Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones underwent surgery and hospitalization for a brain injury in April 2006, some press reports erroneously blamed the injury on Richards' having been \"conked by coconuts\". Falling coconuts had not caused the injury as Richards had climbed a dead tree (not a coconut palm) and had then fallen from the tree.\n\nThe video game \"Donkey Kong 3\" has the antagonist Donkey Kong throwing coconuts from overhead at the player, trying to kill him. A hit causes a missed turn.\n\nIn the \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode \"Rock-a-Bye Bivalve\", Patrick Star is addicted to a show where nothing happens except a man gets hit in the head by a coconut.\n\nIn the \"Kirby\" video game series, explosive coconuts are a reoccurring obstacle that usually fall from trees.\n\nIn 2013, David del Monté published a collection of short stories called \"Coconuts Kill More People Than Sharks\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1893624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1893624", "title": "Downing Street memo", "text": "Downing Street memo\n\nThe Downing Street memo (or the Downing Street Minutes), sometimes described by critics of the Iraq War as the smoking gun memo, is the note of a 23 July 2002 secret meeting of senior British government, defence and intelligence figures discussing the build-up to the war, which included direct reference to classified United States policy of the time. The name refers to 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British prime minister.\n\nThe memo, written by Downing Street foreign policy aide Matthew Rycroft, recorded the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) as expressing the view following his recent visit to Washington that \"[George W.] Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\"\n\nIt quoted Foreign Secretary Jack Straw as saying it was clear that Bush had \"made up his mind\" to take military action but that \"the case was thin.\"\n\nStraw also noted that Iraq retained \"WMD capability\" and that \"Saddam would continue to play hard-ball with the UN.\"\n\nThe military asked about the consequences \"if Saddam used WMD on day one,\" posing Kuwait or Israel as potential targets.\n\nAttorney-General Lord Goldsmith warned that justifying the invasion on legal grounds would be difficult. However, the meeting took place several months before the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, the resolution eventually used as the legal basis for the invasion of Iraq. UNR687 also provided a pre-existing basis, as it required Iraq to divest itself of \"100%\" of all WMD capacity, which the Memo agreed it had not.\n\nA copy of the memo was obtained by British journalist Michael Smith and published in \"The Sunday Times\" in May 2005, on the eve of British elections. Smith stated that the memo was equivalent to the Pentagon Papers which exposed American intentions in the Vietnam War and alleged the American media did not report more about it due to a perceived bias towards support for the war. Though its authenticity has never been seriously challenged, the British and American governments have stated that the contents do not accurately reflect their official policy positions at the time.\n\nThe memo was first published in \"The Sunday Times\" on 1 May 2005, during the last days of the UK general election campaign.\n\nIt went largely unremarked in the U.S. press at first, but was heavily covered in progressive blogs such as those on Daily Kos, because of a remark attributed to Richard Dearlove (then MI6 head) that \"the intelligence and facts were being fixed [by the U.S.] around the policy\" of removing Saddam Hussein from power, which was interpreted to show that US intelligence on Iraq prior to the war was deliberately falsified, rather than simply mistaken.\n\nAs this issue began to be covered by American media (\"Los Angeles Times\" on 12 May 2005, \"Washington Post\" on 13 May 2005, two other main allegations stemming from the memo arose: that the UN weapons inspection process was manipulated to provide a legal pretext for the war, and that pre-war air strikes were deliberately ramped up in order to soften Iraqi infrastructure in preparation for war, prior to the October U.S. Senate vote permitting the invasion.\n\nSome elements of the U.S. media have portrayed the document as faked or fraudulent, and Dana Perino referred in her daily White House press briefing on 4 December 2008 to the fact that the Bush administration has \"debunked\" the document previously. The British have tacitly validated its authenticity (as when Tony Blair replied to a press conference question by saying \"that memorandum was written before we then went to the United Nations.\")\n\nA group of 131 members of Congress led by John Conyers, repeatedly requested that President George W. Bush respond to the contents of the document. A resolution of inquiry was filed by Representative Barbara Lee, which would request that the President and the State Department turn over all relevant information with regard to US policy towards Iraq. The resolution had 70 co-sponsors.\n\nThe minutes were meant to be kept confidential and were headed \"This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.\" It deals with the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, and comes at a point at which it becomes clear to those attending, that US President George W. Bush intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force.\n\nThe minutes run through the military options and then consider the political strategy in which an appeal for support from the international community and from domestic opinion would be most likely to be positively received. It suggests that an ultimatum for Saddam to allow back United Nations weapons inspectors be issued, and that this would help to make the use of force legal. Tony Blair is quoted as saying that the British public would support regime change in the right political context.\n\nThe most controversial paragraph is a report of a recent visit to Washington by head of the Secret Intelligence Service Sir Richard Dearlove (known in official terminology as 'C'):\n\nThe British analysis of US policy is also stated elsewhere in the minutes:\n\nThe main sections covering the ultimatum are:\n\nThe minutes also outlines potential risks of an invasion of Iraq:\n\nIn the United States, proponents of a formal congressional inquiry say that the minutes, along with testimonies from credible witnesses, shed sufficient doubt on the actions of the Bush Administration to warrant a formal inquiry. In particular, they say that the minutes indicate that the Administration was determined to go to war with Iraq prior to considerations of legality, and with full knowledge that, at best, \"the case was slim.\" And furthermore that they selected and exaggerated intelligence so as to confirm their policy and developed a plan to manipulate public opinion. Also, proponents say that the contents (such as \"Military action was now seen as inevitable.\") and the \"date\" of the memo, 23 July 2002, contradicts the official White House position that President Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council, in a speech on 5 February 2003. They also say that the minutes are dated at a time when Bush stated that \"we haven't made any decisions on Iraq, but all options are on the table.\"\n\nAnother paragraph has been taken to show that Geoff Hoon believed the timing of the war was intended to influence American elections:\n\nIt has been said that some of those present at the meeting believed that Iraq might possess weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \"capacity\". However, the minutes explicitly state that the capability was less than that of Libya, Iran, and North Korea, and that Saddam was not threatening his neighbours.\n\nOn 5 May 2005, Democratic Congressman John Conyers sent to President Bush signed by 89 of his colleagues demanding an explanation of the \"troubling revelations\" in the memo. No specific White House response to the letter was ever made publicly. In response to the Bush Administration's refusal to answer the congressional delegation's questions, Conyers et al. considered sending a fact-finding mission to the UK.\n\nConyers initially requested 100,000 signatures from citizens (a petition) to request that President Bush answer the questions in his letter. The letter began accumulating between 20,000 and 25,000 signatures a day, boosted by progressive political action group MoveOn.org, which joined the campaign on 9 June. By 13 June 2005, the letter had received over 540,000 signatures from citizens, and more congressmen had signed on, bringing the total to 94 – three days later, over 100 congressmen had signed the letter, including then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nOn 16 June 2005, Conyers presided over an unofficial hearing or forum on the Downing Street memo in a basement room in the Capitol where notable opponents of the Iraq War Joseph C. Wilson, Ray McGovern and Cindy Sheehan, among others, testified.\n\nSmintheus at Daily Kos, a liberal web site, and MYDD first addressed the memo on the night of 30 April 2005.\n\nBy the next morning the document was elevated to a major story on the Daily Kos, where Democratic Congressman John Conyers learned of its existence.\n\nA website, www.downingstreetmemo.com, was created on 13 May, \"to fill a void left by the American mainstream media,\" and continues with its primary aim \"to provide a resource for anyone who wants to understand the meaning and context of these documents as they relate to the Bush administration's case for war.\"\n\nOn 30 May 2005, in a \"blogswarm\" fueled by the memo, hundreds of blogs joined together to form the Big Brass Alliance in support of After Downing Street.\n\nOn 1 June 2005 a targeted media campaign called 'Awaken the Mainstream Media' began jointly at Daily Kos and downingstreetmemo.com. Every day it listed new contact information for three news outlets, so that readers could contact them to urge them to provide better coverage of the issues around the Downing Street memo and other released documents.\n\nOn 18 May, conservative pundit and former Reagan Administration advisor Paul Craig Roberts wrote an article calling for Bush's impeachment for lying to Congress about the case for war.\n\nOn 31 May, liberal consumer advocate and former Presidential hopeful Ralph Nader wrote an article on ZNet calling for Bush and Cheney’s impeachment under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution. Also on that day, he and Kevin Zeese authored an op-ed for the \"Boston Globe\" to support the call for impeachment against Bush, citing the memo as part of the evidence that the possibility of deliberate deception by the administration should be investigated.\n\nOn 30 January 2006, an article entitled \"The Impeachment of George W. Bush\", written by Elizabeth Holtzman (Rep. NY-D 1973–1981, member of the House Judiciary Committee that held impeachment hearings of President Richard Nixon) was published by the left-wing periodical \"The Nation\". The article makes specific references to the Downing Street memo.\n\nA coalition of American groups known as After Downing Street, co-founded by a group of longtime progressive and/or Democratic Party activists, called on Congress to file a Resolution of Inquiry, the first necessary legal step to determine whether President Bush had committed impeachable offences. The formal Resolution of Inquiry request was written by Boston constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz. The request states the constitutional grounds for impeachment:\n\nDemocrats.com raised one thousand dollars, offered as a reward to anyone who could get George Bush to answer the following question \"Yes\" or \"No:\n\nIn addition a number of lesser prizes were offered for lesser responses, down to a $100 for posing the question clearly to Bush.\n\nThe Downing Street Minutes was a major story in the British press during the last few days of the 2005 general election campaign and was also covered in other countries. The story initially had limited coverage in the US but later recently received greater attention in the American press. The organisation Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has been among those that have criticised the US print media, saying they \"continue to downplay [the] story.\" According to Media Matters for America, there were some early mentions in \"The New York Times\", the \"San Francisco Chronicle\", the \"New York Sun\", and the \"Washington Post\", though coverage was slight (the \"Post\"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> first article appeared in the \"Style\" section) and primarily aimed at the impact it would have on the British elections, rather than how it affected the Bush administration. The Knight-Ridder news service produced some reportage at the time, but independent articles were limited. The \"Los Angeles Times\" and \"Star Tribune\" put local reporters on the story, and produced early articles on 12 May and 13 May, respectively.\n\nAt the \"Star Tribune\", initial interest had been piqued after a reader e-mailed information he had seen on the Internet to the paper's ombudsman, who forwarded it to others in the news department. Being quite a distance from London, editors first waited for articles to come across on wire services. Undoubtedly, many other newspapers across the country reacted similarly. After a few days of no news, however, a local reporter was assigned. The article was initially scheduled to run on 11 May, but was pushed back so that it could have greater prominence on a slower news day later in the week.\n\nSince that time, much of the coverage about the memo has discussed the lack of coverage. One of the first reports include that topic was a 17 May article in the \"Christian Science Monitor\". The report was one of the most extensive for a nationwide publication up until that time.\n\nOn 20 May 2005, Daniel Okrent, the Public Editor at the time for \"The New York Times\", publicly assessed the coverage of the minutes in the paper in a forum on the NYT's website. He also stated that, due to continuing reader interest, the paper intends to give fuller coverage to the memo. Although Okrent stepped down at the end of May (the routine end of his term), on \"NewsHour\" on 8 June he suggested some possible reasons that the US media had been so slow to cover what he considered a very important story. He said it may have been assigned to 'foreign news' correspondents and wasn't seen as a Bush story, or it may be the US media was still working on researching it (although he then admitted he had no reason to believe that).\n\nAlso on 8 June, \"USA Today\" printed an article by their senior assignment editor for foreign news, Jim Cox, saying with respect to the memo, \"We could not obtain the memo or a copy of it from a reliable source. … There was no explicit confirmation of its authenticity from (Blair's office). And it was disclosed four days before the British elections, raising concerns about the timing.\"\n\nThe \"Star Tribune\" revisited the Downing Street Minutes as part of the evidence in a Memorial Day editorial. It stated explicitly,\n\"The New York Times\" reported on the memos on 27 March 2006.\n\nMSNBC reported on the memos on 28 March 2006. MSNBC has an article and a video clip from \"NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams\".\n\nThe Columbian newspaper \"El Tiempo\" implicated the Prime Minister's role in the Iraq War on 9 May 2007 – and the Downing Street memo specifically – as \"the principal reason for the UK's disillusionment with Tony Blair.\"\n\nThe Chilean newspaper \"La Segunda\" on 11 May 2007 called the Downing Street memo \"one of the best-kept secrets in Tony Blair's ten years as prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the first articles on the memo to appear in the US media quoted \"a former senior US official\", who, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the memo's account \"an absolutely accurate description of what transpired\" during the senior British intelligence officer's visit to Washington. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed, also commenting that \"that memorandum was written before we went to the United Nations\".\n\n\nOn 7 June 2005, at a joint George W. Bush-Tony Blair press briefing in the White House, Reuters correspondent Steve Holland asked, \"On Iraq, the so-called Downing Street memo from July 2002 says intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy of removing Saddam through military action. Is this an accurate reflection of what happened? Could both of you respond?\" President Bush did not address the issue of the intelligence and facts being \"fixed\" around a decision to go to war, but he did deny that he had, at the time of the memo, already decided to use military force against Saddam Hussein, saying \"There's nothing farther from the truth.\" Bush also questioned the motives of whoever leaked the memo during the British election, saying \"Well, I—you know, I read kind of the characterisations of the memo, particularly when they dropped it out in the middle of his race. … I'm not sure who 'they dropped it out' is, but—I'm not suggesting that you all dropped it out there.\"\n\nWhen the document was published, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.\n\nBlair's response to Steve Holland at the joint news conference with Bush was \"No, the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all\". He also reiterated that he and Bush had continued to try to find a way to avert war, \"As it happened, we weren't able to do that because – as I think was very clear – there was no way that Saddam Hussein was ever going to change the way that he worked, or the way that he acted,\". He said the same thing in a 7 June 2005 interview with Gwen Ifill on \"The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer\".\n\nOn 16 May, presidential spokesman Scott McClellan said that the memo's statement that intelligence was \"being fixed\" to support a decision to invade Iraq was \"flat out wrong\". However, McClellan admitted that he has not read the memo, but has only received reports of what it contains.\n\nOn 17 May, McClellan told reporters that the White House saw \"no need\" to respond to the letter from Congress.\n\nOn 23 May, when BTC News reporter Eric Brewer asked him about his 16 May statement, McClellan said:\nThe following day, a popular political blog, ThinkProgress, posted a response titled \"Take the McClellan Challenge\", comparing what the intelligence was with how it was used by the administration.\n\nOn 1 May 2005, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were questioned on the memo, although neither was able to give a detailed answer. Straw stated that he had not expected the question to come up.\n\nFollowing the advice of company lawyers, Michael Smith, the journalist who first reported on the Downing Street Memo, has said that he protected the identity of his source by reproducing all documents and returning the 'originals' back to the source. In some cases, a document was retyped from a photocopy, and the photocopy destroyed. This has led some to question the document's authenticity, but no official source has questioned it, and it has been unofficially confirmed to various news organisations, including the Washington Post, NBC, The Sunday Times, and the LA Times. Several other documents obtained by Smith, and treated similarly (see below), were confirmed as genuine by the UK Foreign Office.\n\nPrevious to the appearance of the Downing Street Memo, six other British (Blair) Cabinet papers originating around March 2002 were obtained by Michael Smith and used in two \"Daily Telegraph\" stories published on 18 September 2004. The documents describe issues relating to the meetings held between Bush and Blair at Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch in April 2002. They are:\n\n\nOn receipt of the documents, in September 2004, acting on the advice of lawyers, Smith says he photocopied them and returned the originals to his source, then, after the \"Telegraph\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s legal desk secretary typed transcripts on an \"old fashioned typewriter\", the \"Telegraph\" destroyed their copies of the originals, in order to frustrate any future police investigation of the leaks.\n\nThe documents were widely quoted in the British press immediately following the \"Telegraph\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s story, for example in \"The Guardian\" and \"The Sunday Herald\".\n\nOn 5 October 2004, facsimiles of these documents appeared online, provided by Professor Michael Lewis of Cambridge University, who had also housed the file at Iraq expert Glen Rangwala's Middle East Reference website. The file derives ultimately from the typed transcript of the documents made by Smith and the \"Telegraph\".\n\nInterest in these documents was revived around 8 June 2005, following their appearance in a discussion thread at Democratic Underground and subsequently they began to be quoted in US media, after Rawstory and NBC verified their authenticity with Smith and British government sources.\n\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" published an article on 15 June 2005, describing several of the \"new\" documents; the article says that \"Michael Smith, the defense writer for \"The Sunday Times\" who revealed the Downing Street minutes in a story 1 May, provided a full text of the six new documents to the \"Los Angeles Times\".\"\n\nThe six documents are available in PDF form from the Think Progress web site.\n\nA further document, a 21 July 2002, cabinet office paper titled \"Conditions for Military Action\", which is a briefing paper for the meeting of which the Downing Street Memo is the minutes, was published (with the last page missing) by \"The Sunday Times\" on 12 June 2005.\n\nAnother document was the Rycroft email, showing the author of the Downing Street Memo actually believed that Saddam should be removed because of a threat by Iraq getting WMDs into the hands of terrorists.\n\nThe 18 September 2004 \"Daily Telegraph\" article contains the only known reproductions of the original memos (scanned from a photocopy). That article is called \"Failure is not an option, but it doesn't mean they will avoid it\".\n\nOn Thursday, 16 June 2005 Reuters mislabelled a photograph of what it claimed was \"a copy of the Downing Street Memo\".\n\nIt turned out to actually be a picture of a document found in a 28 April 2005 Guardian Unlimited story. (At this link, view this PDF:\n07.03.03: Attorney general's full advice on Iraq war (pdf)) This PDF detailed Lord Goldsmith’s confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war and does not match the text of any of the alleged Downing Street Memos. It's an entirely different document that describes legal authorisation for the invasion of Iraq under standing UN resolutions.\n\nJournalists such as Fred Kaplan point out that the later section of the memo that discusses potential consequences of an invasion, including Saddam's use of WMD against Kuwait or Israel, directly contradicts interpretations of the memo as a \"smoking gun\" about WMD fabrication.\n\nAs mentioned above, shortly after the appearance of the memo, Tony Blair was asked:\n\nBlair responded:\nIt is not clear whether this is a criticism of the assessment of his own head of foreign intelligence (Dearlove) or a criticism of a particular interpretation of Dearlove's phrase \"fixed around\".\n\nThe interpretation of the sentence: \"But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\" has caused debate.\n\nRobin Niblett, a member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, has said it would be easy for Americans to misunderstand the reference to intelligence being \"fixed around\" Iraq policy. \" 'Fixed around' in British English means 'bolted on' rather than altered to fit the policy,\" he says. This view was seconded by Christopher Hitchens and Fred Kaplan.\n\nOthers have suggested various British English usages of the phrase \"were being fixed\" (for example as a colloquialism meaning \"to agree upon,\") which are distinct from the usage (both American and British) derived from criminal argot, meaning \"fraudulently altered or changed.\" The author of the memo, Matthew Rycroft, employed the former usage in an e-mail when talking about an appointment, \"This is now fixed for 0800\". Some detractors from the memo have appeared to make the argument or give the impression that the \"fraudulently altered\" sense of \"fix\" is uniquely American and does not exist in British English, but this is false.\n\nOther commentaters have dismissed this, saying that context makes it clear that \"being fixed around\" used \"fix\" in the sense of \"fraudulently arrange the result\", a common British usage (sense 12(b) of \"fix\" in the printed Concise Oxford English Dictionary, given as sense 7, \"deviously influence the outcome of\" in the Compact OED online version.) The argument has also been made that this view is supported by negative qualification implied by the presence of the word \"But\" at the start of the relevant sentence: \"But the intelligence and facts were being (innocently) \"agreed upon\" around the policy\" is, it is said, an implausible reading because there is nothing negative, per se, about agreement, whereas \"But the intelligence and facts were being \"fraudulently arranged\" ...\", it is argued, appears to make perfect sense, because it fulfills the negative expectation set up by the word \"but\".\n\nFred Kaplan noted that \"Either way—'fixed' or 'fixed around'—Bush and his aides had decided to let policy shape intelligence, not the other way around; they were explicitly politicising intelligence.\"\n\nWhen asked about the memo's implication that Iraq intelligence was being \"fixed\", White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, \"The suggestion is just flat-out wrong.\" But McClellan would later admit that intelligence was suited to fit the policy in a tell-all book.\n\nAn Iraq \"options paper\", dated 8 March 2002, stated: \"Despite sanctions, Iraq continues to develop WMD\" (though it adds that intelligence on the matter is \"poor\").\n\n\n"}

The violence has escalated into the current 2014 Libyan Civil War.\n\nThe militias include guerrillas, Islamists, and militias who fought against Gaddafi but refused to lay down their arms when the war ended in October 2011. According to some civilian leaders, these latter militias shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as \"guardians of the revolution\". Some of the largest, and most well-equipped militias are associated with Islamist groups now forming political parties. Before the official end of hostilities between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic clashes between rival militias, and vigilante revenge killings.\n\nIn September 2012, Islamists attacked the United States consulate building in Benghazi, killing the US ambassador and three others. This prompted a popular outcry against semi-legal militias that were still operating and resulted in the storming of several Islamist militia bases by protesters. A large-scale government crackdown followed on non-government sanctioned militias, with the Libyan Army raiding several now illegal militias' headquarters and ordering them to disband.\n\nOn 1 November, a group of intoxicated Zintan fighters stormed a hospital in Tripoli and demanded the hand-over of a fighter who was wounded earlier in the day in a clash that also left another militiaman dead. The doctors refused and a Tripoli militia, in charge of hospital security, forced the Zintanis out, but not before they shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups received reinforcements and the fighting, involving heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, lasted for three hours. There were no direct fatalities from the fighting, but three patients at the hospital died due to stress-related causes linked to the clashes. Three Tripoli fighters were wounded. The fighting reportedly ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men.\n\nOn 8 November, it was evident that loyalist remnants were also still active in the country, even more than two weeks after their defeat, when a pro-Gaddafi convoy tried to cross the border into Niger and were intercepted by the Nigerien army. 13 loyalists and one Nigerien soldier were killed.\n\nBetween 8 and 12 November, large-scale fighting erupted between Zawiya and Tripoli between a Zawiya-based militia and a group from the Wershifanna tribe. The Zawiya group accused their opponents of belonging to loyalist remnants and they reported of seeing tanks and vehicles with the Gaddafi-era green flag and markings that said \"Brigade of the Martyr Muammar Gaddafi\". The Wershifanna denied this and stated that the men from Zawiya had been misled by a rumor that pro-Gaddafi fighters were in the area. The fighting was centered around the former loyalist Imaya military base and both sides vied for control. Grad rocket launchers were used at times during the clashes. 9–12 Zawiya fighters and nine Wershifanna fighters were killed.\n\nOn 23 November, a militia force in Bani Walid was ambushed after being sent there to arrest a known Gaddafi supporter. 15 militia members were killed. The survivors reported being shot at and hit with grenades and rockets from houses after they found out all the roads were blocked. Another report stated that the fighting started after a high-speed chase with a suspect vehicle in which a Gaddafi loyalist was killed. One civilian also reportedly died during the fighting.\n\nIn early December, a group of Zintani gunmen attacked the convoy of a top army officer, General Khalifa Haftar, as it was speeding through a checkpoint set up by the group. In a separate incident, gunfire broke out between the army and the Zintan brigade at the Tripoli International Airport. On 16 December, Haftar said an armed group had abducted his son, Belgassim, and detained him at the airport.\n\nOn 6 December, Libya's interim government announced that, following consultations with Tripoli's local council, it had given militias lingering in the capital until late December to hand over security to the authorities. Officials said residents of Tripoli would convene rallies in support of the initiative to clear the city of weapons and out-of-town fighters. If militias had not withdrawn by 20 December, the authorities and members of the public intended to close the whole city to traffic. By January 2012, the former rebels had dismantled most of their checkpoints, while some key bases still remained.\n\nOn 11 December, fighting erupted south of Zintan, between the Zintan militia and members of the El-Mashasha tribe. The clashes started when the El-Mashasha attacked the convoy of a Zintan militia commander, killing him, as he tried to pass through the town of Wamis, around which the tribe was based. The Zintanis retaliated by attacking the town with artillery or rocket fire, hitting houses in residential areas. A mosque and a school were also hit. Over two days of fighting three townspeople were killed. By 13 December, a ceasefire was established. Officials from Zintan stated that the fighting was the result of the El-Mashasha killing several residents of Zintan earlier in week.\n\nOn 3 January, four fighters were killed in a gun battle in Tripoli as dozens of fighters from Misrata were trying to seize a group of prisoners being held in a security compound by Tripoli militias. Another report stated that there were two separate gun battles and put the number of dead at seven. In response to the incident, NTC chairman Mustafa Abdul Jalil warned that Libya risked sliding into civil war if the rival militias were not brought under control.\n\nOn 14 January, two fighters were killed and 36 were injured after clashes between militias from neighbouring towns of Gharyan and Asbi'a. It was reported that artillery and rockets were used during the clashes. On 15 January, the rival groups carried out a prisoner swap and agreed to a ceasefire. Officials said 12 people had been killed and around 100 wounded on both sides. In the days leading up to the fighting, the Asbi'a commander assigned to Gharyan, Ezzedine al-Ghool, was detained and tortured to death by members of the Gharyan militia. His body was dropped off anonymously at a hospital in Tripoli.\n\nOn 20 January, Libya's former ambassador to France died less than a day after he was arrested by a Tripoli militia group. \"Human Rights Watch\" said on 3 February, that marks on Omar Brebesh's body suggested he died as a result of torture while he was in detention.\n\nOn 22 January, a new clash broke out in Tripoli when NTC fighters attempted to arrest a former prisoner, charged with murder, who was released by the Gaddafi government at the start of the civil war the previous year. He and his brother took shelter in their home and opened fire on the militia with RPGs and automatic weapons. Both brothers and an NTC fighter were killed and five militiamen were wounded.\n\nOn 26 January, the humanitarian aid non-governmental organization Médecins Sans Frontières (which had been present in Misrata since April 2011, during the Libyan Civil War) announced the suspension of their work in the city detention centres, as detainees were tortured and denied urgent health care. MSF General Director Christopher Stokes stated: \"Patients were brought to us in the middle of interrogation for medical care, in order to make them fit for more interrogation. This is unacceptable. Our role is to provide medical care to war casualties and sick detainees, not to repeatedly treat the same patients between torture sessions.\". Amnesty International had described two days ago \"widespread torture and ill-treatment of suspected pro-Gadhafi fighters and loyalists.\", with several detainees dying across Libya in the precedent weeks.\n\nUprising started in Bani Walid on 23 January 2012 due to an incident in the city of Bani Walid in which the \"May 28 Brigade\" militia wished to arrest local men in unclear circumstances. The May 28 Brigade and their compound were then attacked by local fighters who then took control of the town.\n\nOn 6 February, seven male black Libyan civilians from Tawergha were killed by militias who raided their makeshift refugee camp at a former naval academy in Janzour, a suburb of Tripoli. The survivors said that they appeared to be from Misrata because of their license plates, though the Misrata militia denied this.\n\nOn 12 February, conflict erupted between Zuwayya and Toubou tribesmen in southern town of Kufra. This conflict lasted several months and led to government military intervention which started uneasy truce between two tribes.\n\nOn 15 February, Amnesty International reported that at least 12 detainees had been tortured to death while in militia custody.\n\nOn 2 March, the head of the security committee in Derna, Colonel Mohammed Al-Hassi, was shot and killed outside a petrol station in the town. He had previously survived two earlier assassination attempts and was also the head of Derna’s anti-drugs unit. He cracked down hard on local drug smugglers during and before the civil war.\n\nOn 6 March, tribal and militia leaders in Benghazi declared unilaterally semi-autonomy for the eastern region of Cyrenaica. This was met with anger from the NTC government in Tripoli and anti-autonomy demonstrations erupted in the capital and Benghazi. On 16 March, a pro-autonomy demonstration was held in Benghazi, which was attacked by unknown gunmen, leaving one person dead and five injured.\n\nOn 18 March, a clash erupted between the Zintan militia and residents of Tripoli's Abu Salim district, previously loyal to Gaddafi. One militiaman was killed before a cease-fire was brokered by the district's own militia commander.\n\n\nLate on 25 March, clashes erupted in the southern city of Sabha, between Arab and Toubou tribesmen, after a man from the Abu Seif tribe was killed in a dispute over a car by the Toubou which lasted for one week.\n\nOn 1 April, 21–34 Zuwara militiamen were detained by members of a neighboring town's militia. The Ragdalein fighters stated that they captured the men after months of abuses by a Zuwara brigade, including the looting of property. For their part, the Zuwara local council head accused Ragdalein to be a hub of Gaddafi loyalists. A third version of the events came from the government Interior Ministry which stated that the trouble started when a Zuwara hunting party near Al-Jumail shot and killed a person from that town by mistake. The hunters were then arrested but released later. Another Zuwara council head claimed that the men were tortured before being released and stated that Zuwara came under mortar and anti-aircraft fire by militias from both Ragdalein and Al-Jumail.\n\nOn 3 April, reports emerged that the fighting in the Zuwara area was still continuing with at least one Zuwara militiaman killed and five wounded. The losses for Ragdalein and Al-Jumail were not known. Clashes were reported at the entrance to Ragdalein while Al-Jumail was shelling Zuwara. At least 14 were killed and 80 injured.\n\nOn 4 April, the fighting escalated with the use of tanks and artillery. The reported number of dead was said to had risen to 26, eight from Zuwara and 18 from the outlying towns, and another 142 Zuwarans were wounded. Unconfirmed reports rose up the death toll to 48 killed in the clashes.\n\nOn 6 April, French leading newspaper \"Le Figaro\" reported that a dozen people were killed near Ghat on 1 and 2 April in fighting between former pro-Gaddafi Tuaregs and the Zintan tribe.\n\nOn 20 April, fighting restarted in Kufra with 12 people being killed and more than 35 wounded when the Tobu fighters were reportedly attacked by units under the command of the Libyan National Army. The fighting began when a Tobu tribesman was killed by members of the Zuwayya tribe. The battles lasted late into 21 April.\n\nOn 8 May, protests outside prime minister office turned violent when ex-rebels, which protested on the non-payment of the promised cash handout by the government, attacked the office in Tripoli. One Interior Ministry’s Supreme Security Committee (SSC) guard was killed, while four others, one protester and three SSC guards, were injured.\n\nOn 15 May, a diplomatic source briefed by Western intelligence officials stated that, beside the tribal rivalries plaguing the country, there was concern about a growing presence of Islamist militants in some areas, specifically the city of Derna. The source said that hundreds of Islamist militants were in and around the town, and there were militant training camps where weapons were also provided. He said one official had described the area as \"a disaster zone.\" Tensions had reportedly grown between local people and the militants. According to the source, the previous month, a number of town residents went to a camp on the outskirts of the city and forced militants to leave. One of the indicators of the militant inter-factional were also the recent spate of car-bombings in Derna. One of the attacks targeted Abdel Hakim al Hasadi, a former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The same day, two people were killed and a third wounded in intertribal clashes in Sorman.\n\nOn 16 May, fighting erupted between Tuareg tribesmen and local militiamen over control of a checkpoint on the edge of Ghadames on a desert route often used for smuggling, near the Algerian border. Between seven and thirteen people were killed and more than 20 wounded. Per one local official, except one person, all of the dead were Tuaregs.\n\nOn 5 June, a militia checkpoint in Gwarsha district was attacked and destroyed by the family of a member of the security forces who had been fatally shot earlier by a militiaman at the checkpoint.\n\nOn 6 June, one person was shot and killed in Sirte, purportedly by anti-Gaddafi gunmen who thought the man was a loyalist.\n\nBetween 11 and 17 June, clashes raged in the town of Zintan. Zintani militiamen were involved in fighting with members of the El-Mashasha tribe, whom they accuse of being Gaddafi loyalists because they did not join the opposition during the civil war the previous year. The fighting reportedly started when a Zintani militiaman was shot and killed at an El-Mashasha checkpoint. At the same time, a security patrol came under fire in Sabha, leaving two dead and 10 wounded. Armed clashes also flared anew in Kufra, leaving one dead and dozens injured. After days of clashes, on 17 June, the Libyan government declared the area around Zintan a military zone and sent troops to stop the fighting. The total casualty toll for the fighting in the Zintan area was ultimately stated to be 105 killed and more than 500 wounded. The majority of the dead were reported to be El-Mashasha. The tribesmen accused the Zintan forces of shelling their town, Sheguiga, with tank and rocket fire.\n\nOn 6 July, a helicopter carrying election material was shot at south of Benghazi killing an election worker.\n\nOn 28 July, Colonel Bouzyreda Sleiman, a former military intelligence agent who defected to the opposition during the civil war, was shot and killed in Benghazi as he was performing the Taraweeh prayers at the Amer Bin Yas mosque. Other former Benghazi interior security officers, as Abdelhamid Kandouz Ali or non-commissioned officer Ibrahim Al-Arabi, were killed several days before by car bombs.\n\nOn 29 July, commander of Libyan ground forces Khalifa Hafter escaped an assassination attempt in Benghazi, when his convoy get under fire from unknown assailants. Abdel-Basit Haroun, a Benghazi militia commander, declared that only during the past month thirteen people who had been close to the former government had been killed. Also in Benghazi, a bomb planted at the Tibesti hotel was defused before it could explode.\n\nOn 1 August, clashes in Abu Isa (between Zawiya and Sorman) between armed gangs who were fighting over some vehicles since the day before ended with the intervention of the Libya Shield Force, with a final toll between two and four killed, and five injured.\n\nOn 10 August, another former Libyan Army officer who was among the first defecting to the opposition, Brigadier General Mohamed Hadia al-Feitouri, was shot and killed in Benghazi. Hadia, then defence ministry official responsible for ammunition and weapons, was returning home from Friday prayers when a group of gunmen pulled up in a car and opened fire on him.\n\nOn 19 August, two people were killed in a two independent car bomb attacks in Tripoli. They are the first fatal bomb attacks since the fall of the Gaddafi regime. The Libyan Ministry of Interior accused Gaddafi loyalists of carrying out the attacks, while those loyalists using an instant messaging service Paltalk were reportedly listening to the Interior Ministry’s communications network.\n\nOn 23 August, tribal clashes with heavy weapons (between Awlad Al-Shaikh tribesmen and Zlitenis according to some sources, and between Al-Haly and Al-Fawatra tribes according to others) started in Zliten, killing between three and twelve people, and injuring dozens. In a separate development, Interior ministry spokesman Abdelmonem al-Hur stated that more than a hundred tanks and twenty-six rocket launchers were seized from an alleged pro-Gaddafi militia (named \"Katibat Al-Awfiyah\", or Brigade of the Faithful), during a raid on their campsite in Tarhuna. The operation ended with one of the suspects killed, eight wounded and thirteen detainees, accused of being linked with the 19 August Tripoli bombings. In Homs, east of Tripoli, a women's hunger strike over conditions at a migrants camp was suppressed by anti-Gaddafi militia members, leaving three Sub-Saharan migrants dead, according to Eritrean Roman Catholic priest Moses Zerai. In Sabha, two African migrants were killed and several others wounded when unknown assailants threw an explosive device at the home where they stayed.\n\nOn 24 August, following the deadly clashes of the day before, the shrine of Sufi scholar Sidi Abd As-Salam Al-Asmar in Zliten (which had been target of an earlier attack in March) was destroyed by Salafist groups using a bulldozer and explosives, according to Zlitan military council official Omar Ali and witnesses. The attackers have also blown up the mosque attached to it and its library, filmed the events and posted the footage online.\n\nOn 25 August, the Al-Shaab Al-Dahmani mosque and shrine in central Tripoli was bulldozed in broad daylight by a group of armed Salafists, including members of the security forces.

{"id": "169503", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=169503", "title": "Ferdinand Waldo Demara", "text": "Ferdinand Waldo Demara\n\nFerdinand Waldo Demara Jr. (December 21, 1921 – June 7, 1982), known as 'The Great Impostor', masqueraded as many people – from monks to surgeons to prison wardens. He was the subject of a movie, \"The Great Impostor\", in which he was played by Tony Curtis.\n\nDemara's impersonations included a ship's doctor, a civil engineer, a sheriff's deputy, an assistant prison warden, a doctor of applied psychology, a hospital orderly, a lawyer, a child-care expert, a Benedictine monk, a Trappist monk, an editor, a cancer researcher, and a teacher. One teaching job led to six months in prison. He never seemed to get (or seek) much monetary gain in what he was doing – just temporary respectability.\n\nMany of Demara's unsuspecting employers, under other circumstances, would have been satisfied with Demara as an employee. Demara was said to possess a true photographic memory and was widely reputed to have an extraordinary IQ. He was apparently able to memorize necessary techniques from textbooks and worked on two cardinal rules: \"The burden of proof is on the accuser\" and \"When in danger, attack.\" He described his own motivation as \"Rascality, pure rascality\".\n\nDemara, known locally as 'Fred', was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1921, at 40 Texas Avenue in the lower southwest Tower Hill Neighborhood. His father, Ferdinand Waldo Demara Sr., was born in Rhode Island and worked in Lawrence's old Theatre District as a motion picture operator. Demara Sr. was financially well-off, and the family lived on Jackson St. in Lawrence, an upper-class neighborhood. Demara Sr.'s brother, Napoleon Louis Demara Sr. owned many of the theatres in Lawrence, in which Demara Sr. was an active union member. Early in the Great Depression, Fred's father became financially insolvent, forcing the family to move from the Tower Hill neighborhood to the poorer section in the city.\n\nDuring this financially troubled time, Demara Jr. ran away from home at age 16 to join the Cistercian monks in Rhode Island, where he stayed for several years. He joined the United States Army in 1941.\n\nThe following year, Demara began his new lives by borrowing the name of Anthony Ignolia, an army buddy, and going AWOL. After two more attempts in monasteries, he joined the Navy where he trained as a hospital corpsman. He did not reach the position he wanted, faked his suicide and borrowed another name, Robert Linton French, and became a religion-oriented psychologist, who taught psychology at Gannon College (now a university) in Erie, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, Demara served as an orderly in a Los Angeles sanitarium, and served as an instructor in St. Martin's College (now a university) in the state of Washington. The FBI captured him, and he served 18 months at the Naval Disciplinary Barracks, San Pedro, California for desertion.\n\nAfter his release he assumed a fake identity and studied law at night at Northeastern University, then joined the Brothers of Christian Instruction in Maine, a Roman Catholic order.\n\nWhile at the Brothers of Christian Instruction, he became acquainted with a young doctor named Joseph C. Cyr.\nThat led to his most famous exploit, in which he masqueraded as Cyr, working as a trauma surgeon aboard HMCS \"Cayuga\", a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer, during the Korean War. He managed to improvise successful major surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of penicillin. His most notable surgical practices were performed on some sixteen Korean combat casualties who were loaded onto the \"Cayuga\". All eyes turned to Demara, the only \"surgeon\" on board, as it became obvious that several of the casualties would require major surgery or certainly die. After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries. Apparently, the removal of a bullet from a wounded man ended up in Canadian newspapers. One person reading the reports was the mother of the real Joseph Cyr; her son at the time of \"his\" service in Korea was actually practicing medicine in Grand Falls, New Brunswick. When news of the impostor reached the \"Cayuga,\" still on duty off Korea, Captain James Plomer at first refused to believe Demara was not a doctor (and not Joseph Cyr). However, faced with the embarrassment of having allowed an impostor into its ranks, Canadian officials chose not to press charges. Instead, Demara was quietly dismissed from the Royal Canadian Navy and forced to return to the United States.\n\nDemara told his biographer he was successful in his roles because he was able to fit into positions which no one else had previously occupied. Demara explained it in the following excerpt from his biography:\n\nDemara referred to it as 'expanding into the power vacuum,' and described as such; 'if you come into a new situation (there's a nice word for it) don't join some other professor's committee and try to make your mark by moving up in that committee. You'll, one, have a long haul and two, make an enemy.' Demara's technique was to find his own committee. 'That way there's no competition, no past standards to measure you by. How can anyone tell you aren't running a top outfit? And then there's no past laws or rules or precedents to hold you down or limit you. Make your own rules and interpretations. Nothing like it. Remember it, expand into the power vacuum!'\n\nDuring Demara's impersonation as Brother John Payne of the Christian Brothers of Instruction (also known as Brothers of Christian Instruction), Demara decided to make the religious teaching order more prominent by founding a college in Alfred, Maine. Demara proceeded on his own, and actually got the college chartered by the state. He then promptly left the religious order in 1951, when the Christian Brothers of Instruction offended him by not naming him as rector or chancellor of the new college and chose what Demara considered to be a terrible name for the college. The college Demara founded, LaMennais College in Alfred, Maine, began in 1951 (when Demara left); in 1959 it moved to Canton, Ohio, and in 1960, became Walsh College (now Walsh University).\n\nAfter this episode, he sold his tale to \"Life\" and worked in short-term jobs, since he had become widely known. He resorted to drinking. Only after he returned to his old tricks and possessed fake credentials could he get another job at a prison in Huntsville, Texas. According to his biographer, Demara's past became known and his position untenable when an inmate found a copy of \"Life\" with an article about the impostor.\n\nOn November 5, 1959, Demara appeared on the surrealistic game show hosted by Ernie Kovacs, \"Take a Good Look\". The object was for one of the three celebrity panelists to guess his identity. One week later on November 12, 1959, he appeared on an episode of the TV quiz show \"You Bet Your Life\", with Groucho Marx. Demara recounted his exploits, and said the $1,000 he earned on the program was going to be donated to the 'Feed and Clothe Fred Demara Fund'.\n\nDemara continued to use new aliases but, as a result of his self-generated publicity, it became much harder to accomplish impersonations than before. In 1960, as a publicity stunt, Demara was given a small acting role in the horror film \"The Hypnotic Eye.\" He appears briefly in the film as a (genuine) hospital surgeon. By this point, Demara's girth was so notable that he could not avoid attracting attention. Demara had already been considerably overweight during his impersonation of Joseph C. Cyr.\n\nIn the early 1960s Demara worked as a counselor at the Union Rescue Mission in downtown Los Angeles. In 1967 Demara received a graduate certificate from Multnomah School of the Bible in Portland, Oregon. His first ministerial assignment was a pastor of the Cherry Grove Baptist Church in Gaston, Oregon. He was very well liked but soon plagued with rumors about his old life, causing him to resign the position. Many parishioners felt this was yet another con, though many others felt he was taking the position seriously and had legitimate credentials.\n\nDemara had various friendships with a wide variety of notable people during his life, including a close relationship with actor Steve McQueen, to whom Demara delivered last rites in November 1980.\n\nWhen Demara's past exploits and infamy were discovered in the late 1970s, he was almost dismissed from the Good Samaritan Hospital of Orange County in Anaheim, California, where he worked as a visiting chaplain. Chief of Staff Philip S. Cifarelli, who had developed a close personal friendship with Demara, personally vouched for him and Demara was allowed to remain as chaplain. Demara was a very active and appreciated minister, serving a variety of patients in the hospital. Few of those with whom he interacted at the hospital knew of his colorful past. Due to limited financial resources and his friendships with Cifarelli and Jerry Nilsson, one of the major owners of the hospital, Demara was allowed to live in the hospital until his death, even after illness forced him to stop working for them in 1980.\n\nDemara died on June 7, 1982, at the age of 60 due to heart failure and complications from his diabetic condition, which had required both of his legs to be amputated. According to his obituary in \"The New York Times\", he had been living in Orange County, California, for eight years. He died at Nilsson's home in Anaheim, California.\n\nDemara's story was recounted in the 1960 book, \"The Great Impostor\", written by Robert Crichton and published by Random House; the book was a \"New York Times\" bestseller and adapted into a 1961 film by the same name starring Tony Curtis as Demara. A second book by Crichton, \"The Rascal and the Road\", recounted Demara and Crichton's experiences together as Crichton conducted research for \"The Great Impostor\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "14375", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14375", "title": "Hogmanay", "text": "Hogmanay\n\nHogmanay (; ) is the Scots word for the last day of the year and is synonymous with the celebration of the New Year (Gregorian calendar) in the Scottish manner. It is normally followed by further celebration on the morning of New Year's Day (1 January) or, in some cases, 2 January—a Scottish bank holiday.\n\nThe origins of Hogmanay are unclear, but it may be derived from Norse and Gaelic observances. Customs vary throughout Scotland, and usually include gift-giving and visiting the homes of friends and neighbours, with special attention given to the first-foot, the first guest of the new year.\n\nThe etymology of the word is obscure. The earliest proposed etymology comes from the 1693 \"Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence\", which held that the term was a corruption of the Greek \"\" (), or \"holy month\". The three main modern theories derive it from a French, Norse or Gaelic root.\n\nThe word is first recorded in a Latin entry in 1443 annals as \"hagnonayse\". The first appearance in English came in 1604 in the records of Elgin, as \"hagmonay\". Subsequent 17th-century spellings include \"Hagmena\" (1677), \"Hogmynae night\" (1681), and \"Hagmane\" (1693) in an entry of the \"Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence\".\n\nAlthough \"Hogmanay\" is currently the predominant spelling and pronunciation, a number of variant spellings and pronunciations have been recorded, including:\n\n\nwith the first syllable variously being , , , or .\n\nIt may have been introduced to Middle Scots via French. The most commonly cited explanation is a derivation from the northern French dialectal word \"hoguinané\", or variants such as \"hoginane\", \"hoginono\" and \"hoguinettes\", those being derived from 16th century Middle French \"aguillanneuf\" meaning either a gift given at New Year, a children's cry for such a gift, or New Year's Eve itself. Compare also the apparent Spanish cognate \"aguinaldo/aguilando\", with a suggested Latin derivation of \"\" \"in this year.\"\n\nThis explanation is supported by a children's tradition, observed up to the 1960s in some parts of Scotland at least, of visiting houses in their locality on New Year's Eve and requesting and receiving small treats such as sweets or fruit. The second element would appear to be \"\" (the New Year), with some sources suggesting a druidical origin of the practice overall. Compare those to Norman \"hoguinané\" and the obsolete customs in Jersey of crying \"ma hodgîngnole\", and in Guernsey of asking for an \"oguinane\", for a New Year gift (see also La Guiannee). In Québec, \"la guignolée\" was a door-to-door collection for the poor.\n\nOther suggestions include \"au gui mener\" (\"lead to the mistletoe\"), \"à mener\" ('bring to the beggars'), \"au gui l'an neuf\" ('at the mistletoe the new year', or \"(l')homme est né\" ('(the) man is born').\n\nThe word may have come from the Goidelic languages. Frazer and Kelley report a Manx new-year song that begins with the line \"To-night is New Year's Night, Hogunnaa\" but did not record the full text in Manx. Kelley himself uses the spelling \"Og-u-naa... Tro-la-la\" whereas other sources parse this as \"hog-un-naa\" and give the modern Manx form as \"Hob dy naa\". Manx dictionaries though give \"Hop-tu-Naa\" (), generally glossing it as \"Hallowe'en\", same as many of the more Manx-specific folklore collections.\n\nIn this context it is also recorded that in the south of Scotland (for example Roxburghshire), there is no , the word thus being \"Hunganay\", which could suggest the is intrusive.\n\nAnother theory occasionally encountered is a derivation from the phrase \"thog mi an èigh/eugh\" (, \"I raised the cry\"), which resembles \"Hogmanay\" in pronunciation and was part of the rhymes traditionally recited at New Year but it is unclear if this is simply a case of folk etymology.\n\nOverall, Gaelic consistently refers to the New Year's Eve as \"Oidhche na Bliadhn(a) Ùir(e)\" (\"the Night of the New Year\") and \"Oidhche Challainn\" (\"the Night of the Calends\").\n\nSome authors reject both the French and Goidelic theories, and instead suggest that the ultimate source both for the Norman French, Scots, and Goidelic variants of this word have a common Norse root. It is suggested that the full forms\ninvoke the hill-men (Icelandic \"haugmenn\", cf Anglo-Saxon \"hoghmen\") or \"elves\" and banishes the trolls into the sea (Norse \"á læ\" \"into the sea\"). Repp furthermore makes a link between \"Trollalay/Trolla-laa\" and the rhyme recorded in \"Percy's Relics\": \"Trolle on away, trolle on awaye. Synge heave and howe rombelowe trolle on away\", which he reads as a straightforward invocation of troll-banning.\n\nThe roots of Hogmanay perhaps reach back to the celebration of the winter solstice among the Norse, as well as incorporating customs from the Gaelic celebration of Samhain. The Vikings celebrated Yule, which later contributed to the Twelve Days of Christmas, or the \"Daft Days\" as they were sometimes called in Scotland. Christmas was not celebrated as a festival and Hogmanay was the more traditional celebration in Scotland. This may have been a result of the Protestant Reformation after which Christmas was seen as \"too Papist\".\n\nThere are many customs, both national and local, associated with Hogmanay. The most widespread national custom is the practice of first-footing, which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and often involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as salt (less common today), coal, shortbread, whisky, and black bun (a rich fruit cake), intended to bring different kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts) are then given to the guests. This may go on throughout the early hours of the morning and well into the next day (although modern days see people visiting houses well into the middle of January). The first-foot is supposed to set the luck for the rest of the year. Traditionally, tall, dark-haired men are preferred as the first-foot.\n\nAn example of a local Hogmanay custom is the fireball swinging that takes place in Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire, in northeast Scotland. This involves local people making up \"balls\" of chicken wire filled with old newspaper, sticks, rags, and other dry flammable material up to a diameter of , each attached to about of wire, chain or nonflammable rope. As the Old Town House bell sounds to mark the new year, the balls are set alight and the swingers set off up the High Street from the Mercat Cross to the Cannon and back, swinging the burning balls around their heads as they go.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony, any fireballs that are still burning are cast into the harbour. Many people enjoy this display, and large crowds flock to see it, with 12,000 attending the 2007/2008 event. In recent years, additional attractions have been added to entertain the crowds as they wait for midnight, such as fire poi, a pipe band, street drumming and a firework display after the last fireball is cast into the sea. The festivities are now streamed live over the Internet. \nAnother example of a pagan fire festival is the burning the clavie in the town of Burghead in Moray.\n\nIn the east coast fishing communities and Dundee, first-footers once carried a decorated herring. And in Falkland in Fife, local men marched in torchlight procession to the top of the Lomond Hills as midnight approached. Bakers in St Andrews baked special cakes for their Hogmanay celebration (known as \"Cake Day\") and distributed them to local children.\n\nInstitutions also had their own traditions. For example, amongst the Scottish regiments, officers waited on the men at special dinners while at the bells, the Old Year is piped out of barrack gates. The sentry then challenges the new escort outside the gates: \"Who goes there?\" The answer is \"The New Year, all's well.\"\n\nAn old custom in the Highlands – which has survived to a small extent and seen some degree of revival – is to celebrate Hogmanay with the \"saining\" (Scots for 'protecting, blessing') of the household and livestock. Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living ford' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants. Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year. The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast.\n\nThe Hogmanay custom of singing \"Auld Lang Syne\" has become common in many countries. \"Auld Lang Syne\" is a Scots poem by Robert Burns, based on traditional and other earlier sources. It is now common to sing this in a circle of linked arms that are crossed over one another as the clock strikes midnight for New Year's Day, though it is only intended that participants link arms at the beginning of the final verse, co-ordinating with the lines of the song that contain the lyrics to do so.\n\nAuld Lang Syne is now sung regularly at \"The Last Night of the Proms\" in London by the full audience with their arms crossed over one another.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1968, a New Year's Eve television programme, \"The White Heather Club\", was presented to herald in the Hogmanay celebrations.\nThe show was presented by Andy Stewart who always began by singing \"Come in, come in, it's nice to see you...\" The show always ended with Andy Stewart and the cast singing, \"Haste ye Back\":\n\nThe performers were Jimmy Shand and band, Ian Powrie and his band, Scottish country dancers: Dixie Ingram and the Dixie Ingram Dancers, Joe Gordon Folk Four, James Urquhart, Ann & Laura Brand, Moira Anderson & Kenneth McKellar. All the male dancers and Andy Stewart wore kilts, and the female dancers wore long white dresses with tartan sashes.\nFollowing the demise of the \"White Heather Club\", Andy Stewart continued to feature regularly in TV Hogmanay shows until his retirement. His last appearance was in 1992.\n\nIn the 1980s comedian Andy Cameron presented the \"Hogmanay Show\" (on STV in 1983 and 1984 and from 1985 to 1990 on BBC Scotland) while Peter Morrison presented the show \"A Highland Hogmanay\" on STV/Grampian, axed in 1993.\n\nFor many years, a staple of New Year's Eve television programming in Scotland was the comedy sketch show \"Scotch and Wry\", featuring the comedian Rikki Fulton, which invariably included a hilarious monologue from him as the preternaturally gloomy Reverend I.M. Jolly.\n\nSince 1993, the programmes that have been mainstays on BBC Scotland on Hogmanay have been \"Hogmanay Live\" and Jonathan Watson's football-themed sketch comedy show, \"Only an Excuse?\".\n\nThe 1693 \"Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence\" contained one of the first mentions of the holiday in official church records. Hogmanay was treated with general disapproval. Still, in Scotland Hogmanay and New Year's Day are as important as Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.\n\nAlthough Christmas Day held its normal religious nature in Scotland amongst its Catholic and Episcopalian communities, the Presbyterian national church, the Church of Scotland, discouraged the celebration of Christmas for nearly 400 years; it only became a public holiday in Scotland in 1958. Conversely, 1 and 2 January are public holidays and Hogmanay still is associated with as much celebration as Christmas in Scotland. Most Scots still celebrate New Year's Day with a special dinner, usually steak pie.\n\nAs in much of the world, the largest Scottish cities – Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen – hold all-night celebrations, as do Stirling and Inverness. The Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrations are among the largest in the world. Celebrations in Edinburgh in 1996–97 were recognised by the \"Guinness Book of Records\" as the world's largest New Years party, with approximately 400,000 people in attendance. Numbers have since been restricted due to safety concerns.\n\nIn 2003-4 most of the organised events were cancelled at short notice due to very high winds. The Stonehaven Fireballs went ahead as planned, however, with some 6,000 people braving the stormy weather to watch 42 fireball swingers process along the High Street. Similarly, the 2006–07 celebrations in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stirling were all cancelled on the day, again due to high winds and heavy rain. The Aberdeen celebration, however, went ahead, and was opened by the pop music group, Wet Wet Wet.\n\nHistorically, presents were given in Scotland on the first Monday of the New Year. A roast dinner would be eaten to celebrate the festival. \"Handsel\" was a word for gift and hence \"Handsel Day\". In modern Scotland this practice has died out.\n\n\n"}

Another venue also named Infinity Hall is operated by the same company in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nThe venue was constructed in 1883 and originally functioned as a combination opera house, barber shop and saloon. The building was chartered as the Norfolk Village Hall, although it was commonly known as the Norfolk Opera House. It was designed by the architect George Palliser, from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who published its design in his book, \"Palliser's Court Houses, Village, Town and City Halls, Jails and Plans of Other Public Buildings\" (1889).\n\nThe Norfolk Opera House hosted vaudeville and theatrical presentations until the late 1940s. For the following four decades, it was used as a restaurant and a grocery store. The building was closed in 1994 and remained vacant for four years.\nIn 1998 Kimberly Gelvin-Melville (now Kimberly Gelvin-Wilks) was given \"right to first refusal\" to try to get the townspeople or someone else to buy and restore the old opera house as a theater and not apartments or offices. She then produced a theater play in the dead of winter to try to draw public awareness of this glorious opera house she wished to run her own theater company in with the help of Trustees. The Four Poster was produced at The White Hart Inn in Salisbury and the Smithies saw the article in the tristate paper, Litchfield Times, about the building and Kimberly Gelvin-Melville's desire to save it. She gave the Smithies permission to purchase it because they liked all of her ideas to turn it back into a theater and run shops downstairs to help finance it. In 1998, the building was purchased by playwrights and theater producers Maura Cavanaugh and Richard Smithies for US$50,000, who undertook a US$650,000 restoration that included the rebuilding of an observation tower that was part of the original structure. Cavanaugh and Smithies renamed the venue the Greenwoods Theater and brought dramatic and musical productions to its stage. Mr. Smithie had asked Kimberly to play Cleopatra in a future production but sadly Mrs. Cavanaugh Smithie decided she did not wish to include Kimberly as a director or actress for fear of her getting the credit for their restorations. The theater was restored and Kimberly attended the opening but then returned to live in Australia with her former husband and daughter.\n\nCavanaugh and Smithies operated the Greenwoods Theater until early 2007, when financial difficulties forced them to close the venue.\n\nThe venue was purchased by Dan Hincks for US $240,000 in a tax auction on February 3, 2007. Hincks, the chief executive officer of the Farmington, Connecticut-based printing and publishing business Data Management, undertook further interior and exterior restorations of the venue, including substantial structural improvements, a new restaurant named Infinity Bistro, a Meyer sound system, modern green room facilities, cabaret mezzanine seating, new wood finishing and expansion of the lower level. The resulting renovation created a 300-seat performing arts theater and restaurant destination. Hincks renamed the venue as Infinity Hall, telling an interviewer: \"I called it Infinity because the sky is the limit when it comes to bringing people together with music.\"\n\nInfinity Hall's opening night was October 17, 2008, with a concert by singer Kenny Rankin. Subsequent concerts featuring Melissa Manchester, Spyro Gyra, Richie Havens and Todd Rundgren. In May 2009, an in-house bistro was opened. In its first two years, Infinity Hall hosted more than 400 concerts attracting in excess of 80,000 patrons. In 2010, Infinity Music Hall was voted Best Music Hall in New England by \"Yankee\" magazine.\n\nInfinity Bistro, which opened May 1, 2009, was voted Best New Restaurant in Litchfield County and runner-up statewide in 2010 by a readers poll for \"Connecticut Magazine\".\n\nBeginning in 2012, Connecticut Public Television and American Public Television began a series of live musical performances at Infinity Hall by well-known artists as part of their \"Infinity Hall Live\" television series.\n\nInfinity Hall, Hartford is located in a modern building on 32 Front Street, in the Front Street Entertainment District, near the Connecticut Convention Center. It seats about 500 total – 415 on the stage level plus 90 in the mezzanine. The mezzanine offers full wait service for dining before and during shows.\n\n"}

He is known for being among four Canadian Sikhs who attempted to assassinate Punjab minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu in 1986. He was involved in the 1985 attack of 33rd Premier of British Columbia Ujjal Dosanjh, a strong opposer of the Khalistani movement. In 2010, he was accused of being part of in an automobile fraud case but was ruled out by the Supreme Court of Canada. In February 2018, Atwal gained attention when he was invited by Canada prime minister Justin Trudeau to a reception during a visit to India and would eventually have his invitation revoked the next day. That same year, he was arrested for issuing death threats to a local radio in British Columbia.\n\nJaspal Atwal was originally from Pharala near a Phagwara district in Punjab, India. He left for Canada at a young age and claimed to study at British Columbia Institute of Technology. He visited India once in the past few years, with a Facebook post of him visiting the Taj Mahal. He is involved in construction business and is currently associated with Media Wave Communications, which runs a Surrey-based online radio station. He was also involved in numerous liberal campaigns and was seen taking pictures with hockey star Wayne Gretzky and other liberal politicians such as Sukh Dhaliwal, Justin Trudeau, and Michael Ignatieff.\n\nIn 1985, Atwal was charged in an attack Ujjal Dosanjh, a strong opposer of the Khalistan movement, but was later acquitted. Dosanjh stated that Atwal attacked him with an iron bar over his opposition to Sikh extremism. The attack left Dosanjh severely injured with 80 stitches and a broken hand. Senior Punjab journalist Baljit Singh Balli, who met Atwal, claimed that Atwal was not involved in any attack and that he was being wrongly charged. Dosanjh would go on to be the 33rd Premier of British Columbia.\nOn May 25, 1986, Atwal was among four men involved in attempting to assassinate Punjib minister Malkiat Singh Sidhu. He was convicted for murderer and was sentenced to 20 years in jail, where he served 5 years before being paroled. At the time of the attempted assassin, Sidhu was visiting Vancouver for a wedding and was forced off an isolated road near Gold River when Atwal arrived. Sidhu was struck twice and survived the shooting, however, he was assassinated in 1991 five years later at his home. At the parole, Atwal admitted he was the shooter that day.\n\nAtwal sparked controversy when he was invited by Justin Trudeau to a reception during a visit to India. He was seen photographed with Sophie Grégoire Trudeau and Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi at an event in Mumbai and was invited to the event by Randeep Sarai. Ujjal Dosanjh criticized Trudeau for inviting Atwal by stating \"Do you have no shame?\" and stated that the relations between Canada and India were rock bottom. Atwal's invitation was rescinded the next day and Trudeau stated that he should have never been invited. He was removed from India's travel blacklist several months ago, while the Indian government stated that he wasn't a security threat.\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer accused Trudeau of \"wining and dining\" with an attempted murderer in a Thursday tweet. Atwal stated that he has a \"friendly relationship\" with Trudeau and that he \"stayed away\" from him to avoid embarrassment. On March 8, 2018, he apologized for the \"embarrassment\" he caused when he attended the event and told reporters that he took full responsibility for his past actions. A new committee of reporters and senators delivered its first classified report regarding the affair with 18 findings and 6 recommendations concerning allegations of foreign interference in Canadian political affairs.\n\nOn April 25, 2018, Atwal was arrested at his home and charged for making threats to a local British Columbia host. According to documents, he faces charges for \"uttering threats to cause death or bodily harm\". His lawyer Marvin Stern stated that he made threats outside a Punjabi radio station in the Vancouver suburb of Surrey, British Columbia. The day after his arrest, he made an appearance in provincial court, but was released without cash or surety. He is expected to face trail on June 7 and appear at the Surrey Provincial Court to plead not guilty.\n\nIn 2012, Atwal was invited to a budget speech of 35th Premier of British Columbia Christy Clark as a guest. In addition, he backed her leadership and was among supporters who accorded her a welcome in Surrey. His presence in the legislature caused embarrassment and a complaint was made to the speaker. Clark's reaction was similar to Wai Young when she received help from Ripudaman Singh Malik, who was acquitted in the Air India Flight 182 bombing. Clark insisted that she didn't know who Atwal was, even though he was invited to her budget speech and shook her hand. After the controversy, liberal party director Tariq Ghuman resigned. Atwal was also a member of the Surrey Fleetwood-Port Kells Liberal riding association of the Federal Liberal Party.\nIn a January 14, 2013 post on Facebook, Atwal was seen in a photo with a young Justin Trudeau. Atwal is a long-time supporter of the liberal party and a former donor to the federal gifts with deep ties to the party that pre-date Trudeau's tenure as prime minister. Official records showed that he donated $500 to the liberal party on April 9, 2011. In May 2015, the Toronto Sun obtained two photos of him with Trudeau, with one at a campaign event in Vancouver and another one outside a house or restraint. He was also seen taking pictures with former liberal leader Michael Ignatieff and interim leader Bob Rae.\n\n"}

In the early 1960s the KIA began expanding and increasing in numbers, especially after the 1962 Burmese coup d'état and its perceived threat by ethnic minorities.\n\nFollowing the unilateral abrogation of the Union of Burma's constitution by General Ne Win and his regime in 1962, many Kachin soldiers in the Tatmadaw (armed forces) defected and joined the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). The KIA did not only fight government soldiers, but occasionally clashed with communists outside and inside their own ranks. The Communist Party of Burma (CPB) had periodically been the KIA's ally and enemy during different years, and a communist-backed faction split from the KIA in 1989, becoming the New Democratic Army - Kachin (NDA-K).\n\nAside from its major towns and railway corridor, KIA-controlled areas in Kachin State remained virtually independent and isolated from the rest of Myanmar from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on cross-border jade trade with China and narcotics trafficking.\n\nAfter a military offensive by the Myanmar Army in 1994 seized most of the jade mines in Kachin State, the KIA signed a ceasefire agreement with the then-ruling SLORC military junta on 24 February 1994, which resulted in an end to large-scale fighting that lasted until June 2011.\n\nArmed clashes erupted between the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) and the Myanmar Army on 9 June 2011, when government forces broke the ceasefire and attacked KIA positions along the Taping River east of Bhamo, Kachin State, near the \"Taping hydroelectric plant\". Fighting occurred throughout Kachin State, as well as northwestern parts of Shan State.\n\nOn 14 June 2014, KIA insurgents captured two hydroelectric plants and took six government soldiers and several Chinese workers hostage for several hours, before the Myanmar Army stormed the buildings. A total of six people were killed and four others were wounded in the incident.\n\nAccording to news reports, the recent fighting broke out as a result of the Burmese government's attempts to seize KIA-controlled areas, which are located around lucrative energy projects in Kachin and Shan State backed by the Chinese government. Despite a December 2011 statement by Myanmar's President Thein Sein that he had ordered the Myanmar Army to cease its offensive in Kachin State, the conflict continued into 2012.\n\nIn 2012, the largest battles of the reignited conflict occurred in March, along the Myitkyina–Bhamo road. In April, the battle for Pangwa in Chipwi Township near Luchang was fought between the KIA and the government soldiers. Clashes erupted again in late April, when the KIA launched an offensive to capture Burmese military posts around Pangwa. The KIA offensive succeeded and the Myanmar Army retreated from the area by the end of April. In August, the KIA claimed that 140 government troops were killed when they exploded mines buried inside the \"Myauk Phyu\" (\"White Monkey\") jade mine, which was owned by the \"Wai Aung Kaba Company\".\n\nFortified KIA positions were heavily damaged by airstrikes and artillery launched by the Myanmar Army from December 2012 to January 2013.\n\nOn 19 November 2014, government soldiers attacked the KIA's headquarters near Laiza, killing at least 22 insurgents.\n\nIn March 2018, the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) launched airstrikes against the KIA in Tanai Township, which is part of a large mining region.\n\nBetween 1 to 6 April 2018, Tatmadaw soldiers allegedly attacked KIA positions in the KIA-controlled Mansi Township, though no reports of fighting emerged from the region. The KIA later raided the Tatmadaw's Battalion 86 military base in Hpakant Township on 6 April 2018, killing eight government soldiers and capturing 13. By 10 April 2018, locals claimed that 18 Tatmadaw soldiers and three KIA insurgents had been killed in the clashes.\n\nAccusations of abuses perpetrated by the Tatmadaw against civilians emerged in March and April 2018, which included allegations that Tatmadaw soldiers specifically targeted and killed two Kachin and six Shanni farmers. Several civilians were also wounded in the crossfire.\n\nBy May 2018, 6,000 IDPs had fled armed clashes and shelling by the Myanmar Army, whilst hundreds more remained trapped in villages caught between the crossfire. Hunger became a prevalent issue for IDPs, with some resorting to eating banana stems.\n\nNumerous rounds of ceasefire talks have taken place between the Kachin Independence Army and the government of Myanmar since fighting resumed in June 2011. According to a 18 December 2012 report by Swedish journalist Bertil Lintner in the Hong Kong-based \"Asia Times Online\", many people have criticised the foreign backed ceasefire efforts for \"avoiding discussions of political issues and only emphasizing ceasefires, disarmament and economic development, those interlocutors—including a 'Peace Support Initiative' sponsored by the Norwegian government and in a separate initiative the Switzerland-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue—are essentially promoting the government's view\". \"The Australian\" reported that some Kachin Business leaders were calling on Aung San Suu Kyi to help mediate the dispute and on 6 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi said that she could not step into the negotiations without an official invitation from the government to do so, which she had not received.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, immediately prior to an international donors conference in Myanmar, President Thein Sein announced a unilateral ceasefire in the war between the army and the KIO. The ceasefire was said to take effect the following day, on 19 January, but light fighting was also reported the following day and a full-scale government assault was reportedly launched on 20 January and included \"sustained mortar and artillery fire\" followed by \"hundreds of Burmese troops\" storming a KIA base on the outskirts of rebel-held town of Laiza.\n\nThe government of Thein Sein was reported to be under pressure from \"political and business circles\" who believed the \"escalating conflict would undermine Myanmar’s emergence from decades of diplomatic isolation\" and had passed a resolution in parliament calling on Min Aung Hlaing, the military’s commander-in-chief, to scale down the war. Min Aung Hlaing responded by stating that the military would only carry out attacks only in \"self-defense\"—the rationale it has consistently given since December 2011 for prosecuting a war against the KIA and the rationale it gave for allowing airstrikes on rebel positions starting on 26 December 2012.\n\nOn 4 February, Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Army met in Ruili, China and agreed to reduce military tension in Kachin State and hold further peace talks later in February. However no talks took place later in February but almost no armed clash reportedly happened in Kachin State after the peace talks. According to Mizzima news, on 26 February a KIO central committee member claimed that they would not be meeting with the government in February because they needed more time to consult with the \"Kachin people\" regarding the negotiations. Burmese government and KIA renewed peace talks in Ruili, China on 11 March 2013. The Chinese government’s refusal to allow observers from western countries at peace talks had delayed negotiations, despite the Chinese rejecting the allegations.\n\nOn 30 May, Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement that would lead to further progress towards reaching a peace deal. The parties however, failed to reach an official ceasefire agreement. United Nations special adviser on Myanmar, Vijay Nambiar, also joined the meeting as an observer, along with representatives of China and other ethnic minorities.\n\nHowever, the Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army failed to reach a permanent ceasefire agreement after several peace talks in 2013, but agreed to work together towards permanent ceasefire agreement and reduce hostilities.\n\nRenewed fighting broke out in April 2014 when the Burmese army attacked various KIA positions around Mansi Township, Kachin State and northern Shan State to eradicate timber smuggling and to control strategic routes around their strongholds. The Kachin Independence Army requested a meeting in Myitkyina on 10 May to lessen tensions between the sides.\n\nNegotiations aimed at drafting a nationwide ceasefire agreement began in April 2014 at the Myanmar Peace Centre between representatives of various ethnic armed groups and the Burmese government, but the KIA and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) were not among the negotiators.\n\nThe KIA's deputy commander-in-chief Gun Maw urged the United States to get involved in the peace process in April 2014.\n\nOn 2 January 2013, the Burmese government confirmed that it carried out airstrikes a few days earlier against the ethnic rebels in northern Kachin, in response to attacks by the Kachin Independence Army. The US government stated that it would \"be formally expressing our concern\" over the escalation of force used by Myanmar government. On 3 January 2013, the KIA alleged that air-strikes had continued to occur for the sixth consecutive day in the area around Laiza and there were allegations that the Myanmar Armed Forces was also using chemical weapons UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon stated following the incidents that Burma's authorities should \"desist from any action that could endanger the lives of civilians living in the area or further intensify conflict in the region\".\n\nCivilians have also been killed in fighting as well as having been specifically targeted. Civilians were often displaced by fighting and faced dangers such as landmines which were frequently laid by government and rebel forces without regard for civilians. Although some civilians had crossed the border with China most remained in northern Burma as of December 2012.\n\nRefugees were being forced by the Chinese government back into Myanmar in August 2012 despite the continued fighting there and the illegality of forcibly returning civilians to war zones under international law. Women have played a significant role in the conflict as both combatants and victims. \"Time Magazine\" documented the presence of many female KIA soldiers in 2012.\n\nIn February 2013 the NGO Kachin Women's Association Thailand (KWAT) reported that the fighting had created over 100,000 refugees and that 364 villages had been wholly or partially abandoned since 2011. The organisation's report also stated that the Burmese Army deliberately attacked refugee camps and villages as well as committed alleged \"war crimes\" such as the rape and murder of civilians.\n\nThe United Nations stated on 28 April 2018 that more than 4,000 people were displaced since armed clashes resumed earlier in the month.\n\nChild soldiers are a major part of the Myanmar Army's and insurgent groups' soldiers. \"The Independent\" reported in June 2012 that children were being sold to the Burmese military for \"as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol\". The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, Radhika Coomaraswamy, who stepped down from her position a week later, met representatives of the Government of Myanmar on 5 July 2012, and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action plan would \"signal a transformation\".\n\nIn September 2012, the Tatmadaw (armed forces) released 42 child soldiers and the International Labour Organization met with representatives of the government as well as the Kachin Independence Army to secure the release of more child soldiers. According to Samantha Power, a US delegation raised the issue of child soldiers with the government in October 2012, however, she did not comment on the government's progress towards reform in this area. A \"Bangkok Post\" article on 23 December 2012, reported that the Myanmar Armed Forces continued to use child soldiers including during the army's large offensive against the KIA.\n"}

The conflict at the beginning was mostly between the government of the House of Representatives (HoR) that was controversially elected in 2014, also known as the \"Tobruk government\"; and the rival General National Congress (GNC) endorsed government, also called the \"National Salvation Government\", based in the capital Tripoli, established after Operation Odyssey Dawn and the failed military coup.\n\nThe HoR, also known as the Council of Deputies, the strongest in eastern Libya, has the loyalty of the Libyan National Army, under the command of General Khalifa Haftar, and has been supported by airstrikes by Egypt and the UAE. The GNC, based in western Libya and backed by various different militias mainly Libya Dawn coalition in west Libya and Libya Shield in the east with some support from Qatar, Sudan and Turkey, initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections. Due to controversy about constitutional amendments, the HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli, which was controlled by powerful militias from the western coastal city of Misrata. Instead, the HoR established its parliament in Tobruk, which is controlled by General Haftar's forces.\n\nIn December 2015, after long talks in Skhirat, the Libyan Political Agreement was signed. The LPA was the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in the capital, Tripoli, Tobruk and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the Government of National Accord. On 30 March 2016 Fayez Sarraj, the head of the GNA, was able to arrive to Tripoli and started working from there despite opposition from GNC. Although the Government of National Accord is currently the only internationally-recognized government in the country, its authority is still not recognized by the HoR, as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon, especially regarding the future of Haftar.\n\nIn addition to those three factions, there are also smaller rival groups: the Islamist Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, led by Ansar al-Sharia (Libya), which has had the support of the GNC and was defeated in Benghazi in 2017; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces;; The Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna which expelled ISIL from Derna in July 2015 and was later itself defeated in Derna by the Tobruk government in 2018. as well as many militias and armed groups, whose allegiances often change.\n\nThe GNA and the GNC launched an offensive to capture areas in and around Sirte from ISIL in May 2016 that resulted in ISIL losing control of all significant territory it previously held in Libya. Forces loyal to Khalifa al-Ghawil attempted a coup d'état against Fayez al-Sarraj and the Presidential Council of the GNA later in 2016.\n\nAt the beginning of 2014, Libya was governed by the General National Congress (GNC), which won the popular vote in 2012 elections. The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the Justice and Construction Party (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.\n\nDivision among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this body.\n\nThe GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist Groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards some armed groups and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda; voting to declare sharia law and establishing a special committee to \"review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law\"; imposing gender segregation and compulsory hijab at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014 until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named Operation Dignity (; 'Amaliya al-Karamah).\n\nThe 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered \"fair and free\" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution. The GNC was made up two major parties, the National Forces Alliance and the Justice and Construction Party, as well as independents in which some where moderates and others conservative Islamists. The GNC became a broad-based congress.\n\nThe GNA elected Nouri Abusahmain as president of the GNC in June 2013. He was considered an independent Islamist and a compromise candidate acceptable to liberal members of the congress, as he was elected with 96 out of a total of 184 votes by the GNC.\n\nThe GNC was challenged due to increasing security concerns in Tripoli. The GNC itself was attacked many times from militias and armed protesters who stormed the GNC assembly hall. Following his appointment, Abusahmain was tasked with providing security. He set up the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR), which was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013. But this armed group was responsible for kidnapping Prime Minister Zeidan in October of that year resulting in the GNC dismissing it from its security function and Abusahmain himself as president. During his term, Abusahmain blocked inquiries into the distribution of state funds and it was alleged that Abusahmain was channeling government funding towards the LROR. The LROR was not an Islamist armed group but rather was made of rebels from the city of Gharyan. Its commander was Adel Gharyani.\n\nIn October 2013, following the kidnapping of the Prime Minister, Abusahmain used his presidency to change the agenda of the GNC in order to prevent a debate over disestablishing the LROR. At the same time, he cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate the allocation, by Abusahmain himself, of 900 million Libyan Dinars (US $720 million) to the LROR and various other armed groups. Instead, the LROR had its responsibilities reduced by the GNC but was allowed to continue to operate, and no one was prosecuted for the incident.\n\nThe kidnapping of Zeidan was believed to be a coup attempt supported by members of the GNC, who was viewed as too moderate (see: 2013 Libyan coup d'état attempt).\n\nMost journalists reported that it was the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR) (Ghurfat Amaliyat al-Thuwar) created by Abusahmain by decree 143 of 7 July. Yet there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case and that armed groups such as the Duru3 actually conducted the kidnapping.\n\nMany Libyans blamed the GNC and the interim government for a continued lack of security in the country. The interim government struggled to control well-armed militias and armed groups that established during the revolution. Libyans in Benghazi especially began to witness assassinations and kidnapping and perceived the GNC to be turning a blind eye to the deteriorating security situation in the east.\n\nBut security concerns increased across the country allowing armed groups to expand in both Tripoli and in the east. \nIn April 2014, an anti-terrorist training base called \"Camp 27\", located between Tripoli and the Tunisian border, was taken over by forces fighting under the control of Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Tantoush, a long-serving Al-Qaeda organizer and former member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group. The Islamist forces at Camp 27 have subsequently been described as part of the Libya Shield Force. The Libya Shield Force was already identified by some observers as linked to al-Qaeda as early as 2012.\n\nAlthough Islamists were outnumbered by Liberals and Centrists in the GNC, in May 2013 they lobbied for a law \"banning virtually everyone who had participated in Gaddafi's government from holding public office\". While several Islamist political parties and independents supported the law, as they generally had no associations to the Qaddafi regime, the law enjoyed strong public support. Polls demonstrates that a large majority of the Libyan people supported the exclusion of high-ranking Qaddafi-regime officials.\n\nThe law particularly impacts elite expatriates and leaders of liberal parties. There existed reservations that such a law would eliminate technocratic expertise needed in Libya at the time.\n\nArmed militiamen stormed government ministries, shut down the GNC itself and demanded the law's passage. This intimidated the GNC into passing the law in which 164 members approved the bill, with only four abstaining and no member opposing it.\n\nGNC opponents argue that it was supporting Islamist actions against women. Sadiq Ghariani, the Grand Mufti of Libya, is perceived to be linked closely to Islamist parties. He has issued fatwas ordering Muslims to obey the GNC, and fatwas ordering Muslims to fight against Haftar's forces\n\nIn March 2013, Sadiq Ghariani, the Grand Mufti, issued a fatwa against the \"UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls\". He condemned the UN report for \"advocating immorality and indecency in addition to rebelliousness against religion and clear objections to the laws contained in the Quran and Sunnah\". Soon after the Grand Mufti issued a clarification op-ed that there should be no discrimination between men and women yet women have a greater role in the family, nevertheless, this does not mean Islam violates the rights of women.\n\nLater in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar, advocate of women's rights, was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration. No arrests were made.\n\nIn June 2013, two politicians, Ali Tekbali and Fathi Sager, appeared in court for \"insulting Islam\" for publishing a cartoon promoting women's rights. Under sharia law they were facing a possible death penalty. The case caused widespread concern although they were eventually acquitted in March 2014. After the GNC was forced to accept new elections, Ali Tekbali was elected to the new House of Representatives.\nDuring Nouri Abusahmain's presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups.\n\nThe GNC failed to stand down at the end of its electoral mandate in January 2014, unilaterally voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests. Residents of the eastern city of Shahat, along with protesters from Bayda and Sousse, staged a large demonstration, rejecting the GNC's extension plan and demanding the resignation of the congress followed by a peaceful power transition to a legitimate body. They also protested the lack of security, blaming the GNC for failing to build the army and police. Other Libyans rejecting the proposed mandate rallied in Tripoli's Martyrs Square and outside Benghazi's Tibesti Hotel, calling for the freeze of political parties and the re-activation of the country's security system.\n\nOn 14 February 2014, General Khalifa Haftar ordered the GNC to dissolve and called for the formation of a caretaker government committee to oversee new elections. However, his actions had little effect on the GNC, which called his actions \"an attempted coup\" and called Haftar himself \"ridiculous\" and labelled him an aspiring dictator. The GNC continued to operate as before. No arrests were made. Haftar launched Operation Dignity two months later, on 16 May.\n\nOn 25 May 2014, about one week after Khalifa Haftar started his Operation Dignity offensive against the General National Congress, that body set 25 June 2014 as the date for new elections. Islamists were defeated, but rejected the results of the election, which saw only an 18% turnout. They accused the new House of Representatives parliament of being dominated by supporters of Gaddafi, and they continued to support the old GNC after the Council officially replaced it on 4 August 2014.\n\nThe conflict escalated on 13 July 2014, when Tripoli's Islamists and Misratan militias launched Operation Libya Dawn to seize Tripoli International Airport, capturing it from the Zintan militia on 23 August. Shortly thereafter, members of the GNC, whom had rejected the June election, reconvened as a new General National Congress and voted themselves as replacement of the newly elected House of Representatives, with Tripoli as their political capital, Nouri Abusahmain as president and Omar al-Hasi as prime minister. As a consequence, the majority of the House of Representatives were forced to relocate to Tobruk, aligning themselves with Haftar's forces and eventually nominating him army chief. On 6 November, the supreme court in Tripoli, dominated by the new GNC, declared the House of Representatives dissolved. The House of Representatives rejected this ruling as made \"under threat\".\n\nOn 16 January 2015, the Operation Dignity and Operation Libya Dawn factions agreed on a ceasefire. The country was then led by two separate governments, with Tripoli and Misrata controlled by forces loyal to Libya Dawn and the new GNC in Tripoli, while the international community recognized Abdullah al-Thani's government and its parliament in Tobruk. Benghazi remained contested between pro-Haftar forces and radical Islamists.\n\nThe pro-GNC forces were a coalition of different militias with different ideologies although most of them are Islamist influenced especially in eastern Libya in Benghazi and Derna. Since LPA negotiations started in Skhirat there has been a rift within the militias over support for the UN-sponsored talks and the proposed Government of National Accord, which seeks to unite the rival governments.\n\nSince GNA started working from Tripoli in March 2015, Libya Dawn coalition the largest of Pro-GNC militias has been disbanded and most of its forces changed allegiances to GNA.\n\nThe Islamist \"Libya Dawn\" has been described as \"an uneasy coalition\" identified as \"terrorists\" by the elected parliament in Tobruk including \"former al-Qaeda jihadists\" who fought against Qaddafi in the nineties, members of Libya's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, and a \"network of conservative merchants\" from Misrata, whose fighters make up \"the largest block of Libya Dawn's forces\". The coalition was formed in 2014 as a reaction against General Khalifa Haftar failed coup and to defeat Zintan brigades controlling Tripoli International Airport whose aligned with him.\n\nThe Zawia tribe has been allied to Libya Dawn since August 2014, although in June 2014 at least one Zawia army unit had appeared to side with General Haftar, and reports in December claimed Zawia forces were openly considering breaking away from Libya Dawn. Zawia militia have been heavily fighting the Warshefana tribe. In the current conflict, the Warshefana have been strongly identified with the forces fighting against both Libya Dawn and Al Qaeda. Zawia has been involved in a long-standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Warshefana tribe since 2011. The motivations of the Zawia brigades participation in the war have been described as unrelated to religion and instead deriving foremost from tribal conflict with the Warshafana and secondarily as a result of opposition to the Zintani brigades and General Haftar.\n\nWhen the head of GNA Fayez Sarraj arrived in Tripoli, Libya Dawn has been disbanded as the interests of the militias forming it conflicted when some of them choose to support GNA others chose to stay loyal to GNC.\n\nThe Libya Shield Force supports the Islamists. Its forces are divided, geographically, into the Western Shield, Central Shield and Eastern Shield. Elements of the Libya Shield Force were identified by some observers as linked to Al-Qaeda as early as 2012. The term \"Libya Shield 1\" is used to refer to the Islamist part of the Libya Shield Force in the east of Libya.\n\nIn western Libya, the prominent Islamist forces are the Central Shield (of the Libya Shield Force), which consists especially of Misrata units, and the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room. Two smaller organizations operating in western Libya are \"Ignewa Al-Kikly\" and the \"Lions of Monotheism\".\n\nAl-Qaeda leader Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi, also known as Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr or Ibrahim Tantoush has been active in western Libya, capturing the special forces base called Camp 27 in April 2014 and losing it to anti-Islamist forces in August 2014. The Islamist forces around Camp 27 have been described as both Al-Qaida and as part of the Libya Shield Force. The relationship between Al-Qaeda and Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is unclear, and their relationship with other Libyan Islamist groups is unclear. Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb are also active in Fezzan, especially in border areas.\n\nLibya western and central Libya Shield force fought alongside Libya Dawn and were disbanded with it in 2015. While the eastern Libya Shield forces merged later with other Islamist militias and formed Revolutionary Shura Council to fight Hafter LNA.\n\nIn Benghazi, the Islamist armed groups have organized themselves into the Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries. These are:\n\nThe Shura Council of Benghazi has been strongly linked with ISIS as they fought together against Hafter in Battle of Benghazi. Yet, the Shura Council never pledged allegiance to ISIS.\n\nMeanwhile, in Derna the main Islamist coalition Shura Council of Mujahideen which was formed in 2014 is an al-Qaeda-affiliated group. The coalition has been in fight with ISIS in 2015 and drove them out from the city.\n\nAjdabiya had its own Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries, which is the most ISIS linked among the three Shura councils. Its leader Muhammad al-Zawi and a number of the council pledging allegiance to ISIS played a major role in strengthening the Islamist group grip on Sirte.\n\nBenghazi Defense Brigades was formed in June 2016 to defend Benghazi and the Shura Council from the Libyan National Army, the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) included various Libya Dawn militias and was organized under the banner of the former Grand mufti Saddiq Al-Ghariyani. Even thought it pledged to support the GNA and apparently working under Mahdi Al-Barghathi, the Defence Minister of the GNA. The GNA never recognized the BDB with some members calling for it to be demarcated as a \"terrorist organization\".\n\nEven though the Amazigh militias mainly situated in Zuwara and Nafusa Mountains fought alongside Libya Dawn, they consider themselves pushed towards that because Zintan brigades and the rest of their enemies has been sided with HoR. Still though, the Amazigh main motivations for fighting against Haftar is his Pan-Arabic ideas which is conflicting with their demands of recognition their language in the constitution as an official language.\n\nWhile keeping their enmity towards Haftar, the Amazigh militias mostly became neutral later in the war especially since the formation of GNA.\n\nThe anti-Islamist Operation Dignity forces are built around Haftar's faction of the Libyan National Army, including land, sea and air forces along with supporting local militias.\n\nThe Libyan National Army, formally known as \"Libyan Arab Armed Forces\", was gradually formed by General Khalifa Haftar as he fought in what he named Operation Dignity. On 19 May 2014, a number of Libyan military officers announced their support for Gen. Haftar, including officers in an air force base in Tobruk, and others who have occupied a significant portion of the country's oil infrastructure, as well as members of an important militia group in Benghazi. Haftar then managed to gather allies from Bayda, 125 miles east of Benghazi. A minority portion of the Libya Shield Force had been reported to not have joined the Islamist forces, and it is not clear if this means they had joined the LNA forces.\n\nSince then Haftar continued to strengthen his LNA by recruiting new soldiers along with the advancements he made on the ground. In 2017 Haftar said that his forces are now larger by \"hundred times\" and now they are about 60 thousand soldiers.\n\nSalafists, called Madkhalis by their enemies fought alongside Haftar LNA since the beginning against the Islamist militias especially Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries and ISIS whom they considered Khawarij after a fatwa from Saudi Rabee al-Madkhali.\n\nSince the Battle of Tripoli Airport, armed groups associated with Zintan and the surrounding Nafusa region have become prominent. The Airport Security Battalion is recruited in large part from Zintan. The \"Zintan Brigades\" fall under the leadership of the Zintan Revolutionaries' Military Council.\n\nWershefana tribal and mainly Gaddafi loyalists armed groups, from the area immediately south and west of Tripoli, have played a big role in Haftar forces west of Libya. On 5 August, they have captured Camp 27, a training base west of Tripoli. Wershefana armed groups have also been involved in a long-standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Zawia city since 2011. Zawia has allied with Libya Dawn since August 2014, although its commitment to Libya Dawn is reportedly wavering.\n\nAfter being accused of kidnapping, ransoming and other crimes, a GNA joint force made up mostly from Zintan brigades defeated them and seized the Wershefana district. Zintan brigades were former allies of Wershefana.\n\nAs of February 2015, damage and disorder from the war has been considerable. There are frequent electric outages, little business activity, and a loss in revenues from oil by 90%. Over 4,000 people have died from the fighting, and some sources claim nearly a third of the country's population has fled to Tunisia as refugees.\n\nA recent announcement from the company said the company aims 900,000 barrels per day in the next year. Oil production has fallen from 1.6 million barrel per day to 900,000 in four years of war.\n\nHostilities first broke out early in the morning of Friday 16 May 2014 when Gen. Haftar's forces assaulted the bases of certain Benghazi Islamist militia groups, including the one blamed for the 2012 assassination of US ambassador Christopher Stevens. Haftar has vowed to not stop until the extremists groups are purged. Shortly before the assault Haftar reportedly asked a close friend, \"Am I committing suicide?\" The operation, codenamed \"Operation Dignity\" by Haftar.\n\nOn 17 May, Haftar held a press conference in which he proclaimed that the current GNC was no longer representing the Libyan people and was illegitimate. He explained that his primary aim was to \"purge\" Islamist militants from Libya, specifically the \"terrorist\" Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nOn 18 May, Gen. Haftar's militia allies in Tripoli attacked parliament, sending lawmakers fleeing for their lives as gunmen ransacked the legislature, declaring the body suspended. A commander in the military police in Libya read a statement announcing the body's suspension on behalf of a group led by Haftar. In the next day evening a group of 5 officers, who identified themselves as the Leaders of the Libyan Army, announced the suspension of the General National Congress. The officers, under the lead of the Zintani former head of Military Intelligence, Col. Muktar Fernana, instead announced that the Constitutional Committee would carry out the work of the GNC. Under the plan al-Thinni's government was to remain in office, and would oversee the formation of military and security forces.\n\nOn 13 July, a coalition of military entities and militias, including the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR) and some brigades from the Misrata Union of Revolutionaries, such as Hatten, Mercer, and Haraka, launched an offensive codenamed \"Operation Dawn\" on Tripoli International Airport, thus beginning the Battle of Tripoli Airport. They were later joined by other militias from Misrata, Tripoli, and Zawiya, as well as by Islamist militias, the Knights of Janzour, Amazigh units, and some militias associated with cities of the Jebel Nafusa.\n\nOn 23 August, after more than a month of fighting, Tripoli International Airport finally fell to fighters from Libyan Central Shield, a coalition of Islamist and Misrata forces. The following day, Operation Dawn forces announced that they have consolidated the whole city and adjacent towns after driving out rival Zintan militias 90 kilometers south of the capital.\n\nIslamist armed groups extended their control over central Tripoli. While the newly elected House of Representatives parliament set up operations in Tobruk. A rival General National Congress parliament continued to operate in Tripoli.\n\nMilitary confrontation between factions in western Libya, particularly since the beginning of October 2014, has increasingly been waged between groups supportive of the Zintani brigades and opponents of those forces. The spread of combat zones beyond Tripoli as well as the intensification of fighting in the Nafusa Mountains has accelerated this trend. Heavy fighting commenced in the city of Kikla and the surrounding vicinity on 11 October when Zintani brigades initiated an offensive to gain control over various towns and routes in the Nafusa Mountains. Clashes between Tuareg and Tebu tribal militias have also been repeatedly flared in Ubari at various times during October.\n\nAfter amassing strength in Sirte, Misratan forces launched on 13 December an offensive called \"Operation Sunrise\" against the Petroleum Facilities Guard, led by Ibrahim Jathran, and other pro-Tobruk forces for control of Ras Lanuf and the Sidra oil terminal. Several days of clashes over the oil facilities have ensued, including the deployment of airstrikes in the struggle. Most of the air assaults have been conducted by forces allied with the Tobruk-based government, however, Libya Dawn forces allegedly carried out an airstrike on 16 December in the al-Hilal region. This attack reportedly caused no casualties or infrastructure damage.\n\nOn 16 January, the Operation Dignity and Libya Dawn factions declared a ceasefire and agreed to form a unity government and further political talks bringing the fights especially in western Libya to a halt.\n\nOn 27 January 2015, gunmen attacked the Corinthia Hotel, a location frequently used by Libyan officials and foreign diplomats, in Tripoli. After detonating a car bomb in the parking lot, the assailants stormed the building and opened fire, killing at least ten individuals, including an American security contractor, before being killed by security forces. Libyan security forces have since reclaimed control over the hotel building. ISIL has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nOn 4 February, gunmen believed to be linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant stormed and seized control of the Al-Mabrook oilfield south of the city of Sirte. A Libyan security source said twelve employees, including four foreigners, were believed to have been killed in the raid.\n\nOn 9 February, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant took over the town of Nofaliya in Sirte District, after a convoy of 40 heavily armed vehicles arrived from Sirte and ordered Nofaliya's residents to \"repent\" and pledge allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The fighters appointed Ali Al-Qarqaa as emir of the town.\n\nOn 13 February, gunmen affiliated with the IS seized government buildings and radio and television stations in Sirte. These force reportedly issued an ultimatum demanding other military entities evacuate the city by the dawn of Sunday (15 February). In response, the unrecognized rump GNC of the Tripoli-based government announced a decision to form a joint force to reclaim facilities in Sirte from IS militants. However this joint force never did attempt to recapture the city from IS, this comes as a result of Misrata militias withdrawing from Sirte when ISIL attacked their posts.\n\nOn 15 February, ISIL in Libya released a video depicting the beheading of 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt. Within hours, the Egyptian Air Force responded with airstrikes against IS training locations and weapons stockpiles in Derna in retaliation for the killings, killing around 50 militants and 7 civilians. Warplanes acting under orders from the Tobruk-based government also struck targets in Derna, reportedly in coordination with Egypt, whereas the Tripoli-based government condemned the airstrikes, calling them \"terrorism\" and \"a violation of sovereignty in Libya\". On 19 February, Qatar recalled its ambassador from Cairo in protest against Egypt's unilateral military action, saying it could harm innocent civilians and advantage one side in Libya's conflict.\n\nOn 20 February, IS operatives detonated three bombs in Al Qubbah, targeting a petrol station, a police station, and the home of parliamentary speaker Agila Salah, allegedly in retaliation to recent Egyptian airstrikes. These attacks reportedly killed at least 40 people. The U.S. State Department, the Misrata Municipality, and Libya Dawn condemned the attacks.\n\nOn 14 March, pro-Dawn forces associated with Misrata and Operation Sunrise clashed with IS militants in Sirte, which marked the start of Battle of Sirte (2015). Fighting between Libya Dawn forces and ISIL militants was also reported in the Daheera area west of the city of Sirte, and at the Harawa vicinity east of Sirte.\n\nOn 29 May, Islamic State fighters captured the Qurdabiya air base south of Sirte after Tripoli aligned troops withdrew from the area.\n\nOn 13 August, 38 residents from the town of Sirte were killed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, after residents revolted against them in reaction to the killing of a Salafist imam who refused to hand over his mosque to the militant extreme group. Among the dead were two children, four elderly people, and the rest were fighters from the local tribe of Furjan. ISIL threatened to use gas against the civilians unless attacks against it stopped.\n\nEfforts to establish peace between the rival governments were made on 16 and 17 December, when the leaders of both governments met in Malta and delegates signed an agreement in Morocco. On 17 December 2015 members of the House of Representatives and the new General National Congress signed the revised political agreement, generally known as the \"Libyan Political Agreement\" or the \"Skhirat Agreement\".\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord were formed, with a view to holding new elections within two years. The House of Representatives was supposed to continue to exist as a legislature and an advisory body, to be known as the High Council of State, was supposed be formed with members nominated by the New General National Congress.\n\nOn 4 January 2016 ISIS took over Bin Jawad during its oil crescent region campaign. On Monday morning, the terrorist group imposed full control over the city of Bin Jawad in the Sirte District, after a series of intense firefights with rebel forces that were loyal to the Libyan provisional government in Tripoli. And on 7 January, a truck bomb attack targeted a police training center in the coastal city of Zliten, killing at least 47 and wounding scores of people. The incident was one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Libyan history. Difficulties in treating the huge number of wounded at facilities in Zliten resulted in many patients being transferred to hospitals in Tripoli, Misrata, and Khoms. Another car bomb attack occurred on the same day at the entrance to the oil port of Ras Lanuf, killing multiple people. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the massacres at Zliten and Ras Lanuf.\n\nOn 23 February, ISIL militants clashed with forces associated with the Sabratha military council inside of Sabratha. These clashes were followed on the same day by an ISIL offensive that allegedly temporarily seized various buildings after penetrating the city. However, local forces conducted a counterattack against the ISIL militants, reportedly driving them out of the city. However, fighting continued in Zawagha district.\n\nOn 12 March, the Presidential Council of the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord issued a statement urging all Libyan institutions to begin a transfer of authority to the unity government. It also called upon the international community to cease all dealings with alternative governments. In the statement, the Presidential Council asserted that a document signed by a majority of the HOR's members expressing support for the new government, in addition to the endorsement by other political figures, conferred legitimacy on the Government of National Accord. And thus on 16 March the European Union agreed to implement sanctions, travel bans, and asset freezes, on Nouri Abusahmain, the president of the Tripoli-based new GNC, Khalifa al-Ghwell, the new GNC's prime minister, and Aguila Saleh, the president of the Tobruk-based House of Representatives citing these three political leaders as being \"spoilers\" obstructing implementation of the U.N-backed plan of resolution to the Libya conflict and the associated Government of National Accord.\n\nDuring an interview on 17 March, Fayez al-Sarraj, the Prime Minister of the U.N/internationally supported Government of National Accord, declared that his government would move into Tripoli \"within in a few days.\" Seraj also stated, in the same interview, that his government's security plan included agreements with police, military forces, and some armed groups in Tripoli that would enable the Government of National Accord to ensconce itself in the capital.\n\nOn 24 March, the Tripoli-based new GNC declared a state of emergency in response to reports that four members of the Government of National Accord had entered Tripoli. Despite GNC government attempts to block GNA move, on 30 March, various members of the Presidential Council, including Prime Minister Fayez Serraj, arrived at a naval base in a Tripoli after travelling from Tunisia on a boat. On 31 March, it was reported that top officials from the GNC, under heavy pressure and warnings from former supporters, had dispersed back to their home cities. GNC Prime Minister Khalifa Ghwell, Sheik Sadeq al-Ghariani, GNC President Abu Sahmain, GNC Media Department head Jamal Zubia, and militia commander Salah Badi were reported as having left Tripoli.\n\nAt the end of March, the mayors of Sabratha, Zultan, Rigdaleen, Al-Jmail, Zuwarah, Ajilat, Sorman, Zawia, as well as those of West and South Zawia, issued a joint statement endorsing the Government of National Accord. And on 2 April, the National Oil Corporation stated that it would work with the Presidential Council.\n\nOn 5 April, the National Salvation Government associated with the General National Congress announced that it was resigning, \"ceasing operations,\" and ceding power to the Presidential Council. Following the dissolution of the GNC, former members of that body declared the establishment of the State Council, as envisaged by the LPA.\n\nOn 28 April, Prime Minister Faiez Serraj issued a prerecorded television address during which he stated that he had tasked his government's Defense Minister, Mahdi Barghathi, with assembling a joint command and a joint operations room for the recapture of Sirte from ISIL. Serraj declared that the forces for the operation would be drawn up of military units from across the country.\n\nOn 5 May, ISIL militants staged a preemptive offensive against GNA-allied forces in Abu Grein and other areas in central Libya. The attacks involved use of vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs), as well as the capture of a number of towns and villages. The initial ISIL assault was followed in the subsequent days by the organization's use of additional VBIED attacks.\n\nThe offensive on Sirte launched on 12 May 2016, under the name \"Al-Bunyan Al-Marsoos,\" variously translated as \"Impenetrable Wall\" or \"Solid Foundation.\" Fighting took place east of Assdada, around 80 km (50 miles) south of Misrata. On 16 May, GNA military forces recaptured Abu Grein from ISIL militants. The next day, the GNA took control over the al-Wishkah district, 25 km from Abu Grein. and eventually reached nearly 50 kilometers from Sirte.\n\nOn 16 May, military forces associated with the Government of National Accord's central region Joint Operations Room claimed to have recaptured Abu Grein from IS militants. This report followed days of intermittent clashes and air strikes. And on May 17, the military forces of the Government of National Accord declared their control over the al-Wishkah district, 25 km from Abu Grein. The GNA's Joint Operations Room stated that their casualties had been six soldiers killed and seventeen injured in ongoing clashes with ISIL forces, eventually reaching nearly 50 kilometres from Sirte.\n\nIn late May, the next stage of the Battle of Sirte (2016) began, pro-GNA military forces seized many locations near the city of Sirte from ISIL. Operation Al-Bunyan Al-Marsoos forces reported the capture of the Sirte power station and also its advance on the town of Jarif to the south of Sirte. Also in late May, the eastern front of Sirte saw action. The Petroleum Facilities Guard reported the capture of Bin Jawad and Noufiliyah from ISIL.\n\nOn 1 August, the United States air forces started its air strikes (co-ordinated with the unity government in Tripoli) against ISIL positions in Sirte.\n\nThe House of Representatives on 22 August rejected the GNA's government with most members of the parliament voting against the government in a motion of no confidence.\n\nOn 6 December, Sirte was declared to be cleared of ISIL loyalists after over 6 months of fighting, depriving the group of their remaining urban stronghold in Libya.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, Marshal Haftar met with Prime Minister Sarraj in Abu Dhabi, where they had a two-hour meeting, which was described as having made progress. During a press conference in Algiers, foreign minister Mohamed Taha Siala stated that the GNA will recognize Marshal Haftar as the supreme commander of the Libyan army if he recognizes the GNA instead of the House of Representatives. This statement caused criticism in Tripoli.\n\nOn July 2017, the Libyan National Army defeated the remaining Islamist forces, ending the nearly three year long Battle of Benghazi.\n\nOn 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the \"so-called\" Skhirat agreement void.\n\nOn 11 April 2018, while Operation Dignity forces started preparing for the assault on besieged Derna it was reported in many newspapers worldwide that General Khalifa Haftar suffered a severe brain stroke and has reportedly been taken to a hospital in Paris. On 26 April after nearly three weeks of absence Khalifa Haftar finally returned to Benghazi after his medical trip to Paris.\n\nOn 2 May 2018, two ISIL fighters attacked the High National Election Commission headquarters in Tripoli before bombing themselves after being surrounded by police resulting in at least 12 deaths. \nOn 7 May 2018, the Battle of Derna began. After 7 weeks and 3 days of fighting, the city fell to the LNA on 28 June 2018.\n\nIn September 2018, new clashes occurred between pro-GNA and pro-Haftar forces.\n\nOn 11 September 2018, ISIL carried out an attack in Tripoli against the National Oil Corporation. \n\nIn November 2018, Major Libyan political figures attended the Palermo Conference in an attempt to resolve Libyan Conflict..\n\nDuring the first half of 2015, the United Nations facilitated a series of negotiating tracks seeking to bring together the rival governments of Libya and warring militias tearing Libya apart. The U.N. representative to Libya reconvened delegations from Libya's rival governments on 8 June 2015 to present the latest draft proposal for a unity government for the war-torn country. After a warning one week earlier that the country was running out of money and had risked ceasing to be a functional state, Bernardino Leon urged at a ceremony in Morocco that the Libyans approve the fourth version of the proposal. On 8 October 2015, Bernardino Leon held a press conference in which the names of several potential members of a unified government were announced.\n\nA meeting between the rival governments was held at Auberge de Castille in Valletta, Malta on 16 December 2015. The meeting was delayed for a few days after the representatives from the Tobruk government initially failed to show up. The leader of the Tripoli government, Nouri Abusahmain, announced that they \"will not accept foreign intervention against the will of the Libyan people,\" while the leader of the Tobruk government Aguila Saleh Issa called on the international community to \"allow [them] time to form an effective unity government.\" Representatives from both governments also met officials from the United Nations, Italy, the United States and Russia in a conference in Rome.\n\nOn 17 December 2015, delegates from both rival governments signed a peace deal backed by the UN in Skhirat, Morocco, although there was opposition to this within both factions. The Government of National Accord was formed as a result of this agreement, and its first meeting took place in Tunis on 2 January 2016.\n\nOn 17 December 2017, general Khalifa Haftar declared the \"so-called\" Skhirat agreement void.\n\nHaftar and his supporters describe Operation Dignity as a \"correction to the path of the revolution\" and a \"war on terrorism\". The elected parliament has declared that Haftar's enemies are \"terrorists\". Opponents of Haftar and the coup d'état government in Tripoli claim he is attempting a coup. Omar al-Hasi, the internationally unrecognized Prime Minister of the Libya Dawn-backed Tripoli government, speaking of his allies' actions, has stated that: \"This is a correction of the revolution.\" He has also contended: \"Our revolution had fallen into a trap.\" Dawn commanders claim to be fighting for a \"revolutionary\" cause rather than for religious or partisan objectives. Islamist militia group Ansar al-Sharia (linked to the 2012 Benghazi attack) has denounced Haftar's campaign as a Western-backed \"war on Islam\" and has declared the establishment of the \"Islamic Emirate of Benghazi\".\n\nEarly in May 2014, the Algerian military said it was engaged in an operation aimed at tracking down militants who infiltrated the country's territory in Tamanrasset near the Libyan border, during which it announced that it managed to kill 10 \"terrorists\" and seized a large cache of weapons near the town of Janet consisting of automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition boxes. \"The Times\" reported on 30 May that Algerian forces were strongly present in Libya and it was claimed shortly after by an Algerian journalist from \"El Watan\" that a full regiment of 3,500 paratroopers logistically supported by 1,500 other men crossed into Libya and occupied a zone in the west of the country. They were later shown to be operating alongside French special forces in the region. However, all of these claims were later denied by the Algerian government through Prime Minister Abdelmalek Sellal who told the senate that \"Algeria has always shown its willingness to assist [our] sister countries, but things are clear: the Algerian army will not undertake any operation outside Algerian territory\".\n\nOn 16 May 2014, the Algerian government responded to a threat on its embassy in Libya by sending a team of special forces to Tripoli to escort its diplomatic staff in a military plane out of the country. \"Due to a real and imminent threat targeting our diplomats the decision was taken in coordination with Libyan authorities to urgently close our embassy and consulate general temporarily in Tripoli,\" the Algerian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Three days later, the Algerian government shut down all of its border crossings with Libya and the army command raised its security alert status by tightening its presence along the border, especially on the Tinalkoum and Debdab border crossings. This also came as the state-owned energy firm, Sonatrach, evacuated all of its workers from Libya and halted production in the country. In mid-August, Algeria opened its border for Egyptian refugees stranded in Libya and said it would grant them exceptional visas to facilitate their return to Egypt.\n\nEgyptian authorities have long expressed concern over the instability in eastern Libya spilling over into Egypt due to the rise of jihadist movements in the region, which the government believes to have developed into a safe transit for wanted Islamists following the 2013 coup d'état in Egypt that ousted Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohamed Morsi. There have been numerous attacks on Egypt's trade interests in Libya which were rampant prior to Haftar's offensive, especially with the kidnapping of truck drivers and sometimes workers were murdered. Due to this, the military-backed government in Egypt had many reasons to support Haftar's rebellion and the Islamist February 17th Martyrs Brigade operating in Libya has accused the Egyptian government of supplying Haftar with weapons and ammunition, a claim denied by both Cairo and the rebel leader. Furthermore, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has become increasingly popular among many Libyans wishing for stability, has called on the United States to intervene militarily in Libya during his presidential candidacy, warning that Libya was becoming a major security challenge and vowed not to allow the turmoil there to threaten Egypt's national security.\n\nOn 21 July, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry urged its nationals residing in Libya to adopt measures of extreme caution as it was preparing to send consular staff in order to facilitate their return their country following an attack in Egypt's western desert region near the border with Libya that left 22 Egyptian border guards killed. A week later, the ministry announced that it would double its diplomatic officials on the Libyan-Tunisian border and reiterated its call on Egyptian nationals to find shelter in safer places in Libya. On 3 August, Egypt, Libya and Tunisia agreed to cooperate by establishing an airbridge between Cairo and Tunis that would facilitate the transfer of 2,000 to 2,500 Egyptians from Libya daily.\n\nOn 31 July, two Egyptians were shot dead during a clash at the Libyan-Tunisian border where hundreds of Egyptians were staging a protest at the Ras Jdeir border crossing. As they tried to cross into Tunisia, Libyan authorities opened fire to disperse them. A similar incident occurred once again on 15 August, when Libyan security forces shot dead an Egyptian who attempted to force his way through the border along with hundreds of stranded Egyptians and almost 1,200 Egyptians made it into Tunisia that day. This came a few days after Egypt's Minister of Civil Aviation, Hossam Kamal, announced that the emergency airlift consisting of 46 flights aimed at evacuating the country's nationals from Libya came to a conclusion, adding that 11,500 Egyptians in total had returned from the war-torn country as of 9 August. A week later, all Egyptians on the Libyan-Tunisian border were evacuated and the consulate's staff, who were reassigned to work at the border area, withdrew from Libya following the operation's success. Meanwhile, an estimated 50,000 Egyptians (4,000 per day) arrived at the Salloum border crossing on the Libyan-Egyptian border as of early August.\n\nAlong with most of the international community, Malta continues to recognize the Government of National Accord as the legitimate government of Libya. Libyan chargé d'affaires Hussin Musrati insisted that by doing so, Malta was \"interfering in Libyan affairs\". Due to the conflict, there are currently two Libyan embassies in Malta. The unrecognized General National Congress now controls the official Libyan Embassy in Balzan, while the internationally recognized House of Representatives has opened a consulate in Ta' Xbiex. Each of the two embassies say that visas issued by the other entity are not valid.\n\nFollowing the expansion of ISIL in Libya, particularly the fall of Nawfaliya, the Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and Leader of the Opposition Simon Busuttil called for the United Nations and European Union to intervene in Libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state.\n\nPost-revolutionary Tunisia also had its share of instability due to the violence in Libya as it witnessed an unprecedented rise in radical Islamism with increased militant activity and weapons' smuggling through the border.\n\nIn response to the initial clashes in May, the Tunisian National Council for Security held an emergency meeting and decided to deploy 5,000 soldiers to the Libyan–Tunisian border in anticipation of potential consequences from the fighting. On 30 July, Tunisian Foreign Minister Mongi Hamdi said that the country cannot cope with the high number of refugees coming from Libya due to the renewed fighting. \"Our country's economic situation is precarious, and we cannot cope with hundreds of thousands of refugees,\" Hamdi said in a statement. He also added that Tunisia will close its borders if necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

This gender gap became wide in the United States in 2009, when 10.5% of men in the labor force were unemployed, compared with 8% of women. Three quarters of the jobs lost in the recession in the U.S. were held by men.\n\nUnemployment has been linked to extremely adverse effects on men's mental health. Professor Ian Hickie of the University of Sydney said that evidence showed that men have more restricted social networks than women, and that those they do have are heavily work-based. Therefore for men the loss of a job means the loss of a whole set of social connections as well. This loss can then lead to men becoming socially isolated very quickly.\n\nIn the United States, only 100 men for every 135 women are receiving bachelor's degrees because of the feminization of the education system over the last 20 years.\n\n"}
{"id": "467423", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=467423", "title": "May you live in interesting times", "text": "May you live in interesting times\n\n\"May you live in interesting times\" is an English expression purported to be a translation of a traditional Chinese curse. While seemingly a blessing, the expression is normally used ironically, with the clear implication that \"uninteresting times\" of peace and tranquillity are more life-enhancing than interesting ones, which, from a historical perspective, usually include disorder and conflict.\n\nDespite being so common in English as to be known as the \"Chinese curse\", the saying is apocryphal, and no actual Chinese source has ever been produced. The most likely connection to Chinese culture may be deduced from analysis of the late-19th-century speeches of Joseph Chamberlain, probably erroneously transmitted and revised through his son Austen Chamberlain.\n\nDespite being widely attributed as a Chinese curse, there is no known equivalent expression in Chinese. The nearest related Chinese expression is \"\" (\"nìng wéi tàipíng quǎn, mò zuò luàn lí rén\"), which is usually translated as \"Better to be a dog in a peaceful time, than to be a human in a chaotic (warring) period.\" The expression originates from Volume 3 of the 1627 short story collection by Feng Menglong, \"Stories to Awaken the World\".\n\nThe basic premise of the curse may also be found in a quote by the German philosopher Hegel:\n\nEvidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided in a memoir written by Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937, and published in 1949. He mentions that before he left England for China in 1936, a friend told him of a Chinese curse, \"May you live in interesting times.\"\n\nFrederic René Coudert, Jr. also recounts having heard the phrase at the time:\n\nResearch by philologist Garson O'Toole shows a probable origin in the mind of Austen Chamberlain's father Joseph Chamberlain dating around the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Specifically, O'Toole cites the following statement Joseph made during a speech in 1898:\n\nFrom this it is likely that the Chamberlain family may have inadvertently transmitted a folk etymology by expanding Joseph Chamberlain's use of the concept to refer to some Chinese curse. \n\nThe phrase is again described as a \"Chinese curse\" in an article published in \"Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education\" in 1943.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "331425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=331425", "title": "Melodifestivalen", "text": "Melodifestivalen\n\nMelodifestivalen (; literally \"The Melody Festival\") is an annual music competition organised by Swedish public broadcasters Sveriges Television (SVT) and Sveriges Radio (SR). It determines the country's representative for the Eurovision Song Contest, and has been staged almost every year since 1959. Since 2000, the competition has been the most popular television programme in Sweden; it is also broadcast on radio and the Internet. In 2012, the semifinals averaged 3.3 million viewers, and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final, almost half of the Swedish population.\n\nThe festival has produced six Eurovision winners and eighteen top-five placings for Sweden at the contest. The winner of the Melodifestival has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception. Since 1999, the juries have been joined by a public telephone vote which has an equal influence over the final outcome. The competition makes a considerable impact on music charts in Sweden.\n\nThe introduction of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children's version of the competition, Lilla Melodifestivalen, also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as \"schlager\" music, are so prevalent that the festival is sometimes referred to as \"Schlagerfestivalen\" (\"The schlager festival\") by the Swedish media. However, other styles of music such as rap, reggae, and glam rock have made an appearance since the event's expansion. The introduction of a grand final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.\n\nWith seven nations competing, the first Eurovision Song Contest took place in Lugano, Switzerland in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a selection, Sveriges Radio (SR) chose to send Alice Babs to the contest in Hilversum. The song selected was \"Samma stjärna lyser för oss två\", later renamed \"Lilla stjärna\". It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.\n\nThe first Melodifestival, incorporated into the \"Säg det med musik\" radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at Cirkus in Stockholm; eight songs participated. Four \"expert\" juries in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Malmö, and Luleå decided the winner. The competition was won by Siw Malmkvist performing \"Augustin\", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by Brita Borg at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the \"Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final\". In the event's early years, it was broadcast to Norway and Denmark through the Nordvision network. The competition adopted its current name, \"Melodifestivalen\", in 1967.\n\nThe Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year. Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest. After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, left-wing groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial \"Alternativfestivalen\". Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976, but returned in 1977.\n\nHundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semifinal.\n\nUntil 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semifinals and final since 2003.\n\nMelodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as ABBA, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \"Symfonin\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir & Viktor's song \"Bada Nakna\". In 2007, twenty-one participants reached \"Sverigetopplistan\". The week after the 2008 final, songs from the festival made up the entire top fifteen on the domestic singles chart.\n\nThe process of narrowing thousands of potential entries down to twenty-eight lasts over seven months. SVT directly selects fourteen entries from amongst the submissions from the public at large. Thirteen additional entries come from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions. Finally, the twenty-eighth entry is selected via the \"Svensktoppen Nästa\" competition. The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is finished by January.\n\nSVT begins looking for songs nine months before the start of the televised Melodifestival (within days of the previous year's Eurovision final). The deadline for submission is in September and songs can be in any language. In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.\n\nThe submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is to reduce the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200. The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for Melodifestivalen 2009 is the most in the competition's history. The SMFF's choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public. The jury ranges from teenagers to people in their fifties. The songs that qualify, along with their composers and lyricists, are announced at the end of September. This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.\n\nSVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \"När löven faller\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \"So Good\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \"Naughty Boy\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semifinal. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement.\n\nThe wildcard (\"joker\") system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semifinal, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.\n\nThe venues for each year's Melodifestival are announced in September of the preceding year. The semifinals are held in towns and cities throughout Sweden. The 16,300-capacity Ericsson Globe in Stockholm has hosted the final since the semifinals were introduced in 2002, through to 2012. In 2013, the final moved to the newly built Friends Arena in Solna Municipality, Stockholm County. The Scandinavium in Gothenburg was offered the 2005 final, but turned it down as it clashed with a Frölunda ice hockey match.\n\nThe event spent its early years at one venue: Cirkus in Stockholm, which hosted the first ten competitions. It has hosted the final of Melodifestivalen seventeen times in total. The Stockholm Globe Arena has hosted seven finals, and SVT's headquarters in Stockholm has staged five. The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 as part of a decentralisation policy at SR. Stockholm has hosted thirty-seven finals in total, including the first fourteen. Gothenburg has hosted eight, and Malmö seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest in the event of a Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg, and the 1992 contest in Malmö. Since 2002, the only venue that has hosted more than three semifinals is Gothenburg's Scandinavium, which has hosted one every year since 2003. In 2008, Andra Chansen was held in Kiruna, north of the Arctic Circle. The finals have since 2013 been hosted in Friends Arena.\n\nThe televised Melodifestival lasts five weeks and consists of six live shows: four semifinals, in which eight songs compete; a Second Chance round featuring songs which narrowly missed out on qualification from the semifinals; and a grand final. Ten songs comprise the final: two automatic qualifiers from each of the semifinals, and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round. In 2015, there are seven songs for each semifinal, and twelve (eight winners and four from Andra Chansen) in the final.\n\nPrior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (\"deltävlingar\") in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00 CET on consecutive Saturday nights. The semifinals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show.\n\nUnlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round - the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen.\nBoth finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semifinal system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections. A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004.\n\nThe Second Chance round (\"Andra chansen\") is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists. Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as Berns Salonger in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.\n\nIn 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semifinal, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable. The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme.\n\nIn 2015, the system was changed again. The eight songs are divided into four duels, with one song from each duel qualifying into the final, bringing the number of finalists to 12.\n\nThe final takes place at 20:00 CET on a Saturday in mid-March. Twelve songs (11 songs in 2009, 10 before 2015) participate: two from each semifinal, four from the Second Chance round, and, only in 2009, the international jury's choice. A running order is decided by the competition's supervisors the week before to ensure that similar songs and artists are kept apart in the final. Dress rehearsals for the final are held on the prior Friday, and tickets sell out almost as quickly as those for the final itself. The final attracts much tourism to its host city; a survey in 2006 showed that 54% of spectators had travelled from outside the host city, Stockholm. Of these, 6% had come from outside Sweden.\n\nAs at Eurovision, a broadcast of the EBU logo introduces and closes the television coverage, accompanied by the prelude to Marc-Antoine Charpentier's setting of \"Te Deum\". Video \"postcards\" introduce the entries. The final includes interval performances, which are performed while the juries deliberate and before the televote closes. Former Melodifestivalen contestants have performed as interval acts in the past, including Lena Philipsson in 2005 and the multi-artist medley of former entries in 2000.\n\nThe winner receives a trophy, \"Den stora Sångfågeln\" (\"The Great Songbird\"), from the previous year's winner. The trophy, designed by Ernst Billgren, was unveiled in 2005 and awarded to all previous Melodifestivalen winners at the \"Alla tiders Melodifestival\" gala in March of that year. The winner of the competition reprises their song at the end of the event.\n\nBefore the introduction of the current voting system in 1999, a group of regional or age-based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen. In 1993, televoting was used experimentally, but proved unsuccessful. The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls, and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results. Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back-up juries' votes, which showed that the winner, Arvingarna's \"Eloise\", would have finished fourth had the juries' votes counted. SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims.\nThe current voting format introduced in 1999 is a positional voting system, similar to that used at the Eurovision Song Contest. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points (2 x 638 since 2018), which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Until 2017, each jury awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs; however, since 2018, the points have been changed to 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2010, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points (or 638 and 64 points respectively since 2018). The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner.\n\nTelephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted. Two telephone numbers are used for each song, giving voters the option of whether to donate money to SVT's \"Radiohjälpen\" charity appeal or not as they vote. Viewers can also vote by text message, and only residents of Sweden can vote.\n\nThe votes of the juries are announced by spokespeople who are not members of the juries. The votes are read in ascending order, beginning with one point and finishing with twelve. When read, they are repeated by the host, for example:\n\nSpokesperson: \"Ett poäng till melodi nummer två.\" (\"One point to song number two.\")\nPresenter: Ett poäng till (name song).\" (\"One point to (name song).\")\n\nSince 2012, most spokespeople have announced the points in English, with the hosts repeating them in Swedish.\n\nAs the votes are announced, they are collated on a graphic scoreboard. SVT varies the way the jury votes are announced from year to year. For example, the finalists of \"\" acted as spokespeople in 2004, and in 2006 Fredrik Lindström announced jury tallies using the dialects of each region. The final of Melodifestivalen has broken Nordic voting records on several occasions; in 2007, voting figures exceeded two million for the first time.\n\nIf there is a tie, the song that has received more votes from the public receives the higher position. There have been two ties for first place in the history of the contest. In 1969, Tommy Körberg tied for first place with Jan Malmsjö. The juries them voted for their favourite out the two, leading to Tommy Körberg winning. In 1978, Björn Skifs tied for first place with Lasse Holm and Wizex (performing together); a similar tie-break process resulting in Skifs winning.\n\nFifty-five of Sweden's fifty-six Eurovision representatives have come from Melodifestivalen. Sweden has won the Eurovision Song Contest six times: in 1974, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2012 and 2015. Sweden has the second highest number of wins for a country at Eurovision; only Ireland has won the contest more often. The 1974 Eurovision winner, ABBA's \"Waterloo\", was voted the most popular Melodifestivalen song of all time at the \"Alla tiders Melodifestival\" gala in March 2005. Later that year, it was voted most popular Eurovision song of the contest's first fifty years at a gala in Copenhagen. The following table lists those entries which finished fifth or higher at Eurovision:\n\nThis list includes those who have acted as presenters of Melodifestivalen. In 1986, there were two presenters for the first time, while in 2000, 2004, 2005 and 2006, various people were presented the shows.\n\nNo Melodifestivalen was held in 1964, 1970 or 1976 due to Sweden not participating in the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nMost of Melodifestivalen's rules are dictated by those of the Eurovision Song Contest. However, regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters. The competition's official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year's Melodifestival, to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers.\n\nThere was a limit of six people on stage for each performance. This included the Melodifestivalen choir (\"huskören\", literally \"the house choir\"), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists could use some or all of the back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks. However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks. A live orchestra was used every year from the event's debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and \"Göte Wilhelmsons kvartett\", a jazz quartet. Since 2001, participants have performed to backing tracks.\n\nEntries cannot be publicly broadcast until the semifinals are previewed on radio. Entries eliminated in the semifinals may be broadcast as soon as the semifinal has finished. An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast. After this, restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted.\n\nBroadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with \"April, April\". Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with Lill-Babs for the Eurovision Song Contest. The 1987 winner \"Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola\", performed by Lotta Engberg, is another example; the song's title was changed to \"Boogaloo\" for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix \"-loo\".\n\nUntil 1999, competing songs were only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975. This did not stop most winning entries recording English (and other language) versions of their songs. Since the abolition of Eurovision's language restrictions in 1999, regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen, every Swedish entry has been in English. Spanish, French, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Bosnian and Persian are among the other languages to have featured. Cameron Cartio's entry in Melodifestivalen 2005 was performed in a constructed language.\n\nMelodifestivalen is broadcast on television, radio and the internet. It is broadcast on SVT1 with international coverage on SVT World. Until 1987, the competition was broadcast on Sveriges Radio TV, later known as TV1. Between 1988 and 2000, the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held. Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal 1 (formerly TV1) while finals in Gothenburg or Malmö were broadcast on TV2. Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on P1, P3 and P4, where is currently broadcast.\n\nAlthough the final is traditionally held on a Saturday, in 1990 it was held on a Friday. TV2 suggested this would attract more viewers. In 1991, it was held on Easter Sunday for the same reason. The 2002 final was delayed by a week for coverage of the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe competition has had an official website since 1999. Webcasts have been provided since 2005. Since 2006, between February and the Eurovision final in May, SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called \"P4 Melodifest\". On P4, the public previews semifinalists every Friday. Broadcast the night after the final, a \"dagen efter\" (\"the day after\") television programme acts as an epilogue to the event. It gauges the reactions of the finalists after the competition's climax. No commentary is given for the event on television. Carolina Norén is commentator on the event for Sveriges Radio. The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and Dolby Digital since 2004.\n\nThe competition's viewing figures have been rising since 2002. In 2007, approximately 4.1 million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9 million and 3.2 million viewers watched each of the semifinals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990. Melodifestivalen is given heavy coverage in the Swedish press. A study by the Economic Science and Communication Department at Karlstad University concluded that coverage from the press may have influenced the results of the 2007 festival.\n\nMelodifestivalen's image has evolved throughout its existence, but one word has defined the competition's music: \"schlager\". In Sweden, schlager (a German word literally meaning a \"hit\") represents any song associated with the competition, from the jazz music featured heavily in the 1960s to entries such as Linda Bengtzing's in 2006. Christine Demsteader of \"The Local\" described Swedish schlager as \"typically characterized by an annoyingly repetitive melody and trivial lyrics of little or no meaning\".\n\nJazz artists such as Monica Zetterlund and Östen Warnerbring won the event in the 1960s. ABBA, who won Eurovision in 1974, went on to be Sweden's most successful music export. The group influenced not only Melodifestivalen, but the entire Swedish mainstream music scene. In the 1980s, Bert Karlsson's Mariann Grammofon record label was responsible for the prevalence of \"easy, memorable tunes\". The early twenty-first century has seen more variety in the competition, such as Afro-dite's 2002 disco winner and The Ark's 2007 \"retro glam rock\" effort.\n\nOn-stage gimmicks have long been a part of performances at the competition. Lena Philipsson's use of a microphone stand in her performance of \"Det gör ont\" at the 2004 competition is an example. When Philipsson hosted Melodifestivalen in 2006, four tongue-in-cheek short films were broadcast during the semifinals to show what had happened to the microphone stand in the years since her win. Pyrotechnics are another common gimmick in Melodifestivalen performances. After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of \"Dagens Media\" criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was \"the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition\" and the event had become \"a cross between [reality series] \"Fame Factory\" and [inter-city game show] \"Stadskampen\"\".\n\n\n<div class=\"references\">\n\n"}

Her body went unidentified for 27 years until February 11, 2015 when relatives came across her unidentified person's profile online and submitted their DNA. She had been shot to death, most likely by William Ross Knight, who was known for his criminal career in the 1980s.\n\nCriswell's parents divorced when she was three years old. Her father was a trucker and her mother, who had custody of Deanna in Spokane, Washington, worked two jobs to support their family. Her older sister, fourteen years her senior, had left home a year after their parents divorced. She often spent time with her grandfather while her mother was away and became a \"rebellious teen\" following his death and was involved with a questionable group of older peers. She later moved into her father's residence in Seattle, where her behavior improved until age 15 when similar pattern of actions resurfaced. She then took a bus back to Spokane to live with her mother once more. \n\nSix months before her death, she had run away from home and lived on the streets, still calling her father on occasion. She eventually began a relationship with 36-year-old William \"Bill\" Ross Knight, who then relocated to Tucson, Arizona and sent Criswell a bus ticket in September 1987 to reunite. She failed to call with her father after arriving. He was not immediately concerned due to the fact that she was able to \"take care of herself.\" By the time Christmas arrived, he attempted to file a missing person report, yet local officials declined to cooperate due to her history of running away.\n\nCriswell's decomposing body was located in a culvert along Interstate 10 on November 25, 1987 in Marana, Pima County, Arizona by a homeless man. The man walked to the local police station to report the find. Tire tracks were present at the scene, indicating she had been killed at another location and deposited out of sight after death.\n\nShe was estimated to have been between seventeen and twenty-one, at a height of around five feet, three inches and a weight of 138 pounds. It was believed that the victim was white or possibly a Hispanic or Native American female with fair skin. The victim's brown hair was determined to be short and curly. Her eye color could not be determined, as she had begun to decompose after exposure to the hot environment for several days or weeks. There were no distinctive scars, birthmarks or tattoos on the body.\n\nShe was wearing several layers of clothing, including a denim jacket with its sleeves rolled, a white jacket, gray sweater, a multicolored flannel shirt, black jeans, white shoes and purple underwear, the large amount of clothing indicating she was a runaway or perhaps a migrant. A purple sweater had been placed over her face, indicating her killer knew her during life. The victim also had unusual and large upper front teeth that had a gap in between and had cared well for her teeth, also receiving adequate dental care. She was shot five times with a .22 caliber firearm. Criswell suffered four wounds to the torso and one to the neck at close range.\n\nAfter the discovery of the body, the remains were transported to the Pima County Medical Examiner for an autopsy, where the cause of death would be determined and physical characteristics were estimated. It was discovered the victim had recently had sex, but had not been raped, as no trauma characteristic of a violent attack was found.\n\nDetails of the case were released in efforts to identify the victim but proved fruitless. Several missing females were compared to the case; many of which were excluded based on dental characteristics. Additionally, fingerprints were used for comparison. After the investigation stalled, she was buried in the Pima County Cemetery in 1989.\n\nThe case was eventually reopened in 2009 and the victim's body was exhumed. There were no suspects at the time, as the man who discovered the body had long since been cleared of any involvement. Additionally, another person of interest was eliminated from the case in 1988. Benjamin Batson, a convicted sex offender, previously seen with an unknown teenage girl, was stopped by police for a traffic violation near the location where the body was found. No trace of Criswell was located in his vehicle At their location in Virginia, the FBI completed a forensic facial reconstruction of the victim in 2010, after her exhumation, in hopes that someone who knew the victim in life could possibly recognize her. Her DNA was also processed by the agency.\n\nIn 2011, a partial DNA profile was generated from evidence at the crime scene, which was not possible to perform in the past because of limitations with technology. The profile matched William Knight, who was now known for his spree robberies in the 1980s. One particular robbery in 1987 involved a .22 caliber pistol, which was the same caliber used in Criswell's murder. Knight died in 2005 due to liver complications while serving time in prison and was never charged with her murder. Although a suspect was identified, the victim's DNA had yet to match with any individual in the CODIS database. Investigators feared with Knight being deceased, they would be unable to identify the victim, due to the fact that he could not be questioned or prosecuted.\n\nIt was announced that Criswell's body was identified on February 11, 2015. Her estranged aunt and uncle, who at first were hoping she was still alive, eventually turned to online databases, to search through unidentified persons cases after their hope dwindled. Criswell was never reported missing by her family members, which is most likely a major reason why she remained unnamed for decades. Because of her history of running away from home, her family made the assumption that she would \"contact them when she wanted to,\" as she had called her sister once after arriving in Tucson. The pair began to search through cases in Arizona, as they eventually learned that Criswell had been given a bus ticket by Knight to the area that she was later found dead. \n\nApproximately five to ten months before her identification, they had discovered the unidentified person case on The Doe Network and believed that the Jane Doe was their missing niece, as the reconstruction bore a strong resemblance to her. Other characteristics, such as the height and weight approximation, were also similar. After the pair contacted authorities, DNA samples were taken from Criswell's immediate family members to compare to the then-unidentified remains. The gravestone that stands over her remains was removed and updated to bear the victim's name.\n\n"}

{"id": "23868651", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23868651", "title": "Pin prick attack", "text": "Pin prick attack\n\nA pin prick attack is a hypothetical assault on another person with a needle or syringe tainted with the blood of somebody carrying a blood-borne disease, such as HIV. Although there have been numerous cases of people being attacked with needles and syringes, the idea that people infected with AIDS have deliberately attempted to infect others in this manner is generally considered an urban legend. Only two documented cases exist of a pin prick attack leading directly to the transmission of HIV.\n\nAlthough fanciful tales of so-called \"needle men\" or white slavers, who supposedly injected unsuspecting young girls with morphine before carrying them away into a life of prostitution, had been around since the 1930s, the legend probably has its roots in a 1989 incident where ten teenage girls were arrested and later charged with stabbing numerous women with pins in the Upper West Side area of New York City. Coming near the height of the 1980s HIV scares, this led to a great deal of panic amongst the local community although health officials were keen to stress that the chances of anybody contracting the virus in this way were practically zero, and nobody affected in the attacks subsequently tested positive for HIV.\n\nThe rise of the Internet in the 1990s led to the rise of numerous urban legends concerning the pin prick attack, which could be quickly spread via email and discussion forums and which soon assumed a standardised form. The email would take the form of a warning to others that a young person had been visiting a cinema or a night club when the person felt a slight prick on his or her arm. Not taking any notice, the person would carry on with his or her leisure activity, and it was only later that the person would find stuck to his or her clothes or in his or her pocket a badge or sticker carrying the slogan \"welcome to the AIDS club\", followed a few months later with a positive HIV test. These rumours bear similarities to the so-called AIDS Mary legends of the 1980s, whereby a man would enjoy a one-night stand with a stranger at his house and awaken the next morning to find the stranger gone and the words \"Welcome to the AIDS Club\" written in red lipstick on his bathroom mirror. However, the American Center for Disease Control has stressed on numerous occasions that it has yet to confirm a single case of HIV as being transmitted in this fashion and has dismissed such emails as a hoax. The motive behind such emails appears to be little more than a scare story intended to frighten the recipient into staying away from leisure establishments by playing on the public fear of AIDS and the notion that an individual could be infected with a killer disease through no fault of one's own.\n\nA pin prick attack leading to the deliberate transmission of HIV occurred at the Long Bay Jail in Sydney on July 22, 1990, when prison officer Geoffrey Pearce was attacked by HIV-infected prisoner Graham Farlow, who stabbed him with a syringe full of his own infected blood. Despite immediate medical attention and the \"one in 200\" chance of being infected, Pearce tested positive for the disease a few months later, and died of an AIDS related illness in 1997 at age 28.\n\nIn 1992, Brryan Jackson was injected with a syringe of HIV-infected blood by his father. Jackson was diagnosed with AIDS that same year.\n\nIn 1998, Richard J. Schmidt, a physician in Lafayette, Louisiana, was convicted of attempted murder after injecting a former lover, Janice Trahan, with AIDS and Hepatitis C-tainted blood, claiming to be giving her a vitamin shot. Trahan developed both Hep-C and HIV as a result.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "612757", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=612757", "title": "Piper Alpha", "text": "Piper Alpha\n\nPiper Alpha was an oil production platform in the North Sea approximately north-east of Aberdeen, Scotland, that was operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Limited. It began production in 1976, initially as an oil-only platform but later converted to add gas production.\n\nAn explosion and resulting oil and gas fires destroyed Piper Alpha on 6 July 1988, killing 167 people, including two crewmen of a rescue vessel; 61 workers escaped and survived. Thirty bodies were never recovered. The total insured loss was about £1.7 billion ($3.4 billion), making it one of the costliest manmade catastrophes ever. At the time of the disaster, the platform accounted for approximately ten percent of North Sea oil and gas production, and the accident is the worst offshore oil disaster in terms of lives lost and industry impact.\n\nIn Aberdeen, the Kirk of St Nicholas in Union Street has dedicated a chapel in memory of those who died containing a Book of Remembrance listing all who died. There is a memorial sculpture in the Rose Garden of Hazlehead Park.\n\nFour companies that later transformed into the OPCAL joint venture obtained an oil exploration licence in 1972, discovered the Piper oilfield located at in early 1973 and commenced fabrication of the platform, pipelines and onshore support structures. Oil production started in 1976 with about of oil per day increasing to . A gas recovery module was installed by 1980. Production declined to by 1988. OPCAL built the Flotta oil terminal in the Orkney Islands to receive and process oil from the Piper, Claymore and Tartan oilfields, each with its own platform. One diameter main oil pipeline ran from \"Piper Alpha\" to Flotta, with a short oil pipeline from the Claymore platform joining it some to the west. The Tartan field also fed oil to Claymore field and then onto the main line to Flotta. Separate diameter gas pipelines run from Tartan platform to the Piper, and from Piper to the gas compressing platform MCP-01 some to the northwest.\n\nA large fixed platform, \"Piper Alpha\" was situated on the Piper oilfield, approximately 120 miles (193 km) northeast of Aberdeen in 474 feet (144 m) of water, and comprised four modules separated by firewalls.\nThe platform was constructed by McDermott Engineering at Ardersier and Union Industrielle d'Entreprise at Cherbourg, with the sections united at Ardersier before tow out during 1975, with production commencing in late 1976.\nFor safety reasons the modules were organised so that the most dangerous operations were distant from the personnel areas. The conversion from oil to gas broke this safety concept, with the result that sensitive areas were brought together; for example, the gas compression next to the control room, which played a role in the accident. It produced crude oil and natural gas from 24 wells for delivery to the Flotta oil terminal on Orkney and to other installations by three separate pipelines. At the time of the disaster, \"Piper\" was one of the heaviest platforms (along with Magnus and Brae B) operating in the North Sea.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, major works were carried out to enable the platform to meet UK Government gas export requirements and after this work had been completed, Piper Alpha was operating in what was known as phase 2 mode (operating with the Gas Conservation Module (GCM)) since the end of 1980 up until July 1988; phase 2 mode was its normal operating state. In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major work activities, with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) during this demanding period.\n\nBecause the platform was completely destroyed, and many of those involved died, analysis of events can only suggest a possible chain of events based on known facts. Some witnesses to the events question the official timeline.\n\n12:00 noon\nTwo condensate pumps, designated A and B, displaced the platform's condensate for transport to the coast. On the morning of 6 July, Pump A's pressure safety valve (PSV #504) was removed for routine maintenance. The pump's two-yearly overhaul was planned but had not started. The open condensate pipe was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (flat metal disc also called a \"blind flange\" or blank flange). Because the work could not be completed by 6:00 p.m., the disc cover remained in place. It was hand-tightened only. The on-duty engineer filled in a permit which stated that Pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances.\n\n6:00 p.m.\nThe day shift ended, and the night shift started with 62 men running \"Piper Alpha\". As he found the on-duty custodian busy, the engineer neglected to inform him of the condition of Pump A. Instead he placed the permit in the control centre and left. This permit disappeared and was not found. Coincidentally there was another permit issued for the general overhaul of Pump A that had not yet begun.\n\n7:00 p.m.\nLike many other offshore platforms, \"Piper Alpha\" had an automatic fire-fighting system, driven by both diesel and electric pumps (the latter were disabled by the initial explosions). The diesel pumps were designed to suck in large amounts of sea water for fire fighting; the pumps had an automatic control to start them in case of fire (although they could not be remotely started from the control room in an emergency). However, the fire-fighting system was under manual control on the evening of 6 July: the \"Piper Alpha\" procedure adopted by the Offshore Installation Manager (OIM) required manual control of the pumps whenever divers were in the water (as they were for approximately 12 hours a day during summer) although in reality, the risk was not seen as significant for divers unless a diver was closer than from any of the four level caged intakes. A recommendation from an earlier audit had suggested that a procedure be developed to keep the pumps in automatic mode if divers were not working in the vicinity of the intakes as was the practice on the Claymore platform, but this was never developed or implemented.\n\n9:45 p.m.\nBecause of problems with the methanol system earlier in the day, methane clathrate (a flammable ice) had started to accumulate in the gas compression system pipework, causing a blockage. Due to this blockage, condensate (natural gas liquids NGL) Pump B stopped and could not be restarted. As the entire power supply of the offshore construction work depended on this pump, the manager had only a few minutes to bring the pump back online, otherwise the power supply would fail completely. A search was made through the documents to determine whether Condensate Pump A could be started.\n\n9:52 p.m.\nThe permit for the overhaul was found, but not the other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing safety valve. The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that a vital part of the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would be safe to start Pump A. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.\n\n9:55 p.m. First Explosion\nCondensate Pump A was switched on. Gas flowed into the pump, and because of the missing safety valve, produced an overpressure which the loosely fitted metal disc did not withstand.\n\nGas audibly leaked out at high pressure, drawing the attention of several men and triggering six gas alarms including the high level gas alarm. Before anyone could act, the gas ignited and exploded, blowing through the firewall made up of panels bolted together, which were not designed to withstand explosions. The custodian pressed the emergency stop button, closing huge valves in the sea lines and ceasing all oil and gas extraction.\n\nTheoretically, the platform would then have been isolated from the flow of oil and gas and the fire contained. However, because the platform was originally built for oil, the firewalls were designed to resist fire rather than withstand explosions. The first explosion broke the firewall and dislodged panels around Module (B). One of the flying panels ruptured a small condensate pipe, creating another fire.\n\n10:04 p.m.\nThe control room of \"Piper Alpha\" was abandoned. \"Mayday\" was signalled via radio by radio operator David Kinrade. \"Piper Alpha's\" design made no allowances for the destruction of the control room, and the platform's organisation disintegrated. No attempt was made to use loudspeakers or to order an evacuation.\n\nEmergency procedures instructed personnel to make their way to lifeboat stations, but the fire prevented them from doing so. Instead many of the men moved to the fireproofed accommodation block beneath the helicopter deck to await further instructions. Wind, fire and smoke prevented helicopter landings and no further instructions were given, with smoke beginning to seep into the personnel block.\n\nAs the crisis mounted, two men donned protective gear and attempted to reach the diesel pumping machinery below decks and activate the firefighting system. They were never seen again.\n\nThe fire would have burnt out were it not being fed with oil from both Tartan and the Claymore platforms, the resulting back pressure forcing fresh fuel out of ruptured pipework on Piper, directly into the heart of the fire. The Claymore platform continued pumping oil until the second explosion because the manager had no permission from the Occidental control centre to shut down. Also, the connecting gas pipeline to Tartan continued to pump, as its manager had been directed by his superior. The reason for this procedure was the huge cost of such a shut down. It would have taken several days to restart production after a stop, with substantial financial consequences.\n\nGas pipelines of both and diameter ran to \"Piper Alpha\". Two years earlier Occidental management ordered a study, the results of which warned of the dangers of these gas lines. Because of their length and diameter, it would have taken several hours to reduce their pressure, which meant fighting a fire fuelled by them would have been all but impossible. Although the management admitted how devastating a gas explosion would be, Claymore and Tartan were not switched off with the first emergency call.\n\n10:05 p.m.\nThe Search and Rescue station at RAF Lossiemouth receives the first call notifying them of the possibility of an emergency, and a No. 202 Sqn Sea King helicopter, \"Rescue 138\", takes off at the request of the Coastguard station at Aberdeen. The station at RAF Boulmer is also notified, and a Hawker Siddeley Nimrod from RAF Kinloss is sent to the area to act as \"On-Scene Commander\" and \"Rescue Zero-One\".\n\n10:20 p.m. Tartan Gas Line Rupture\nTartan's gas line (pressurised to 120 Atmospheres) melted and ruptured, releasing 15-30 tonnes of high pressure gas every second, which immediately ignited. From that moment on, the platform's destruction was assured.\n\n10:30 p.m.\nThe \"Tharos\", a large semi-submersible fire fighting, rescue and accommodation vessel, drew alongside \"Piper Alpha\". The \"Tharos\" used its water cannon where it could, but it was restricted, because the cannon was so powerful it would injure or kill anyone hit by the water.\n\n10:50 p.m. MCP-01 Gas Line Rupture\nThe second gas line ruptured (the riser for the MCP-01 platform), ejecting millions of cubic feet of gas into the conflagration and increased its intensity. Huge flames shot over in the air. The \"Tharos\" was driven off by the fearsome heat, which began to melt the surrounding machinery and steelwork. It was only after this explosion that the Claymore platform stopped pumping oil. Personnel still left alive were either desperately sheltering in the scorched, smoke-filled accommodation block or leaping from the various deck levels, including the helideck, into the North Sea. The explosion also killed two crewmen on a fast rescue boat launched from the standby vessel \"Sandhaven\" and the six \"Piper Alpha\" crewmen they had rescued from the water.\n\n11:18 p.m. Claymore Gas Line Rupture\nThe gas pipeline connecting \"Piper Alpha\" to the Claymore Platform ruptured, adding even more fuel to the already massive firestorm that engulfed Piper Alpha.\n\n11:35 p.m.\nHelicopter \"Rescue 138\" from Lossiemouth arrives at the scene.\n\n11:37 p.m.\n\"Tharos\" contacts Nimrod \"Rescue Zero-One\" to apprise him of the situation. A standby vessel has picked up 25 casualties, including three with serious burns, and one with an injury. \"Tharos\" requests the evacuation of its non-essential personnel to make room for incoming casualties. \"Rescue 138\" is requested to evacuate 12 non-essential personnel from \"Tharos\" to transfer to \"Ocean Victory\", before returning with paramedics.\n\n11:50 p.m.\nWith critical support structures burned away, and with nothing to support the heavier structures on top, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes collapsed, followed by the drilling derrick. The generation and utilities Module (D), which included the fireproofed accommodation block, slipped into the sea, taking the crewmen huddled inside with it. The largest part of the platform followed it. \"Rescue 138\" lands on \"Tharos \" and picks up the 12 non-essential personnel, before leaving for \"Ocean Victory\".\n\n11:55 p.m.\n\"Rescue 138\" arrives at \"Ocean Victory\" and lands the 12 passengers before returning to \"Tharos\" with 4 of \"Ocean Victory\"'s paramedics.\n\n00:07 a.m., 7 July\n\"Rescue 138\" lands paramedics on \"Ocean Victory\".\n\n00:17 a.m.\n\"Rescue 138\" winches up serious burns casualties picked up by the Standby Safety Vessel, MV \"Silver Pit\".\n\n00:25 a.m.\nFirst seriously-injured survivor of \"Piper Alpha\" is winched aboard \"Rescue 138\".\n\n00:45 a.m.\nThe entire platform had gone. Module (A) was all that remained of \"Piper Alpha\".\n\n00:48 a.m.\n\"Rescue 138\" lands on \"Tharos\" with three casualties picked up from MV \"Silver Pit\".\n\n00:58 a.m.\nCivilian Sikorsky S-61 helicopter of Bristow Helicopters arrives at \"Tharos\" from Aberdeen with Medical Emergency Team.\n\n01:47 a.m.\nCoastguard helicopter lands on \"Tharos\" with more casualties.\n\n02:25 a.m.\nFirst helicopter leaves \"Tharos\" with casualties for Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n\n03:27 a.m.\n\"Rescue 138\" lands on \"Tharos\" with the bodies of two fatalities. \"Rescue 138\" then leaves to refuel on the drilling rig \"Santa Fe 140\".\n\n05:15 a.m.\n\"Rescue 137\" arrives at \"Tharos\" and after landing, then leaves taking casualties to Aberdeen.\n\n06:21 a.m.\nUninjured survivors of \"Piper Alpha\" leave \"Tharos\" by civilian S-61 helicopter for Aberdeen.\n\n07:25 a.m.\n\"Rescue 138\" picks up remaining survivors from \"Tharos\" for transfer to Aberdeen.\n\nAt the time of the disaster 226 people were on the platform; 165 died and 61 survived. Two men from the Standby Vessel \"Sandhaven\" were also killed.\n\nThere is controversy about whether there was sufficient time for more effective emergency evacuation. The main problem was that most of the personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to \"Piper Alpha\" until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that \"Piper Alpha\" was burning.\n\nThe nearby diving support vessel \"Lowland Cavalier\" reported the initial explosion just before 10:00 pm, and the second explosion occurred twenty two minutes later. By the time civil and military rescue helicopters reached the scene, flames over 100 metres in height and visible as far away as 100 km (120 km from the \"Maersk Highlander\") away prevented safe approach. The largest number of survivors (37 out of 59) were recovered by the Fast Rescue Boat of the Standby Safety Vessel, MV \"Silver Pit\"; coxswain James Clark later received the George Medal. Others awarded the George Medal were Charles Haffey from Methil , Andrew Kiloh from Aberdeen, and James McNeill from Oban .\n\nThe blazing remains of the platform were eventually extinguished three weeks later by a team led by firefighter Red Adair, despite reported conditions of winds and waves. The part of the platform which contained the galley where about 100 victims had taken refuge was recovered in late 1988 from the sea bed, and the bodies of 87 men were found inside.\n\nThe Cullen Inquiry was set up in November 1988 to establish the cause of the disaster. It was chaired by the Scottish judge William Cullen. After 180 days of proceedings, it released its report \"Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster\" (short: \"Cullen Report\") in November 1990. It concluded that the initial condensate leak was the result of maintenance work being carried out simultaneously on a pump and related safety valve. The inquiry was critical of \"Piper Alpha's\" operator, Occidental, which was found guilty of having inadequate maintenance and safety procedures, but no criminal charges were ever brought against the company.\n\nThe second part of the report made 106 recommendations for changes to North Sea safety procedures:\n\nThey led to the adoption of the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992.\n\nMost significant of these recommendations was that operators were required to present a safety case and that the responsibility for enforcing safety in the North Sea should be moved from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive, as having both production and safety overseen by the same agency was a conflict of interest.\n\nThe disaster led to insurance claims of around $1.4 billion USD, making it at that time the largest insured man-made catastrophe. The insurance and reinsurance claims process revealed serious weaknesses in the way insurers at Lloyd's of London and elsewhere kept track of their potential exposures, and led to their procedures being reformed.\n\nSurvivors and relatives of those who died went on to form the \"Piper Alpha\" Families and Survivors Association, which campaigns on North Sea safety issues. The wreck buoy marking the remains of the Piper is approximately 1.1 nautical miles from the replacement Piper Bravo platform. A lasting effect of the \"Piper Alpha\" disaster was the establishment of Britain's first \"post-Margaret Thatcher\" trade union, the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee.\n\nA memorial sculpture, showing three oil workers, was erected in the Rose Garden within Hazlehead Park in Aberdeen. The figures represent on the west the physical nature of offshore trades, the east youth and eternal movement and the north holds an unwinding spiral that represents oil in the left hand. The sculptor is Sue Jane Taylor, the Scottish artist who had visited the Piper platform the previous year, and based much of her work around what she saw in and around the oil industry. One of the survivors was used as a model for one of the figures. In 1991, Scottish composer James MacMillan wrote \"Tuireadh\", a piece for clarinet and string orchestra, as a musical complement to the memorial sculpture. In 2008, to mark the 20th anniversary of the disaster, a stage play, \"Lest We Forget\" was commissioned by Aberdeen Performing Arts and written by playwright Mike Gibb. It was performed in Aberdeen in the week leading up to the anniversary with the final performance on 6 July 2008, twenty years to the day.\n\nBeginning in 1998, one month after the tenth anniversary, Professor David Alexander, director of the Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research at Robert Gordon University carried out a study into the long-term psychological and social effects of Piper Alpha. He managed to find thirty-six survivors who agreed to give interviews or complete questionnaires. Almost all of this group reported psychological problems. More than 70% of those interviewed reported psychological and behavioural symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. Twenty-eight said they had difficulty in finding employment following the disaster; it appears that some offshore employers regarded Piper Alpha survivors as Jonahs – bringers of bad luck, who would not be welcome on other rigs and platforms. The family members of the dead and surviving victims also reported various psychological and social problems. Alexander also wrote that \"some of these lads are stronger than before Piper. They've learned things about themselves, changed their values, some relationships became stronger. People realised they have strengths they didn't know they had. There was a lot of heroism took place.\"\n\nIn 2013, on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the video \"Remembering Piper - The Night That Changed Our Lives\" was released by Step Change in Safety. A three-day conference was held in Aberdeen to reflect on lessons learned from Piper Alpha and industry safety issues in general.\n\nThe incident was featured in the 1990 STV documentary television series \"Rescue\", about the RAF Search and Rescue Force at RAF Lossiemouth, in the episode \"Piper Alpha\". Coincidently, the film crew had been documenting the rescue teams at Lossiemouth at the time of the \"Piper Alpha\" accident.\n\nOn 6 July 2008, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 90-minute Drama on Three entitled \"Piper Alpha\". Drawing on the actual evidence given to the Cullen Inquiry the events of that night were retold twenty years to the minute after they happened.\n\nNational Geographic featured this incident in an episode of its \"Seconds From Disaster\" documentary. The 2013 documentary film \"Fire in the Night\" is about the disaster.\n\nIn 2018, the disaster was featured on \"James Nesbitt's Disasters That Changed Britain\". Testimonials were heard from survivors and relatives of victims.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1543002", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1543002", "title": "Polybius (urban legend)", "text": "Polybius (urban legend)\n\nPolybius is a fictitious arcade game, the subject of an urban legend that supposedly first emerged in early 2000. It has served as inspiration for several free and commercial games by the same name.\n\nThe real game allegedly was part of a government-run psychology experiment based in Portland, Oregon. Gameplay supposedly produced intense psychoactive and addictive effects in the player. These few publicly staged arcade machines were said to have been visited periodically by men in black for the purpose of data-mining the machines and analyzing these effects. Eventually, all of these \"Polybius\" arcade machines allegedly disappeared from the arcade market.\n\n\"Polybius\" is also the name of the Greek historian, Polybius, who was known for his assertion that historians should never report what they cannot verify through interviews with witnesses.\n\nAn entry for the title was added to arcade game resource coinop.org on February 6, 2000. The entry mentions the name \"Polybius\" and a copyright date of 1981, although no such copyright has ever been registered. The author of the entry claims in the description to be in possession of a ROM image of the game, and to have extracted fragments of text from it, including \"1981 Sinneslöschen\". The remainder of the information about the game is listed as \"unknown\", and its \"About the game\" section describes the \"bizarre rumors\" that make up the legend.\n\nThe story tells of an unheard-of new arcade game appearing in several suburbs of Portland, Oregon in 1981, something of a rarity at the time. The game is described as proving popular to the point of addiction, with lines forming around the machines often resulting in fighting over who would play next. The urban legend describes how the machines were visited by men in black, who collected unknown data from the machines, allegedly testing responses to the game's psychoactive effects. Players supposedly suffered from a series of unpleasant side effects, including amnesia, insomnia, night terrors and hallucinations. Approximately one month after its supposed release in 1981, \"Polybius\" is said to have disappeared without a trace.\n\nThe company named in most accounts of the game is \"Sinneslöschen\". The word is described by writer Brian Dunning as \"not-quite-idiomatic German\" meaning \"sense delete\" or \"sensory deprivation\". These meanings are derived from \"Sinne\", \"senses\" and \"löschen\", \"to extinguish\" or \"to delete\".\n\nSome time prior to September 2003, Kurt Koller, the owner of coinop.org, submitted a tip-off to the video game magazine \"GamePro\" about \"Polybius\". \"Polybius\" then appeared in the September 2003 issue of \"GamePro\", as part of a feature story on video games called \"Secrets and Lies.\" This was noteworthy, as it was the first known printed mention of the game, exposing the legend to a mass-market audience. The article declared the existence of the game to be \"inconclusive,\" helping to both spark curiosity and spread the story.\n\nFollowing the appearance in \"GamePro\" magazine, a number of individuals came forward claiming to have some involvement with \"Polybius.\" In 2006, a man named Steven Roach claimed he had been one of the original programmers and that his company developed a game with very intense and cutting-edge graphics. However, according to Roach, a boy experienced an epileptic seizure while playing, and the cabinets were withdrawn by the company in a panic. Although Roach offered no proof for his claims, his story added details on the gameplay, which later inspired Rogue Synapse's game based on the legend.\n\nThe original game's existence has never been authoritatively proven. Snopes.com claims to have debunked the existence of the game as a modern-day version of 1980s rumors of \"men in black\" visiting arcades and taking down the names of high scorers at arcade games. This led to the hypothesis that the government was hosting some sort of experiment and sending subliminal messages to the players. Magazines of the time period dedicated to electronic gaming make no mention of a \"Polybius\", and mainstream news also fails to note such a game. While a number of mockup cabinets and games inspired by the myth do exist, no authentic cabinets or ROM dumps have ever been located. Ben Silverman of Yahoo! Games remarked: \"Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the game ever existed, no less turned its users into babbling lunatics ... Still, \"Polybius\" has enjoyed cult-like status as a throwback to a more technologically paranoid era.\"\n\nSkeptics and researchers have differing ideas on how and why the story of \"Polybius\" came about. American producer and author Brian Dunning believes \"Polybius\" to be an urban legend that grew out of a mixture of influences in the 1980s. He notes that two players fell ill in Portland on the same day in 1981, one collapsing with a migraine headache after playing \"Tempest\", and another suffering from stomach pain after playing \"Asteroids\" for 28 hours in a filmed attempt to break a world record at the same arcade. Dunning records that the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided several video arcades in the area just ten days later, where the owners were suspected of using the machines for gambling, and the lead-up to the raid involved FBI agents monitoring arcade cabinets for signs of tampering and recording high scores. Dunning suggests that these two events were combined in an urban legend about government-monitored arcade machines making players ill. He believes that such a myth must have been established by 1984, and that it influenced the plot of the film \"The Last Starfighter\", in which a teenager is recruited by aliens who monitored him playing a covertly-developed arcade game. Dunning considers \"Sinneslöschen\" to be the kind of name that a non-German speaker would generate if they tried to create a compound word using an English-to-German dictionary.\n\nThe game \"Cube Quest\", released in arcades in 1983, is a shooting game with surreal visuals which played from a laserdisc; as such its visuals were far ahead of typical games of the time, and it would be frequently visited for maintenance (because of frequent breakdowns of laserdisc players in arcade games) and often removed from arcades after a short time for the same reason. Many commentators believe that players claiming to remember having played or seen \"Polybius\" may actually be recalling \"Cube Quest\".\n\nHowever, some skeptics believe that the \"Polybius\" myth has a far more recent origin. British filmmaker and video game journalist Stuart Brown, after his investigation of the legend's origin, did not find any evidence of the \"Polybius\" myth existing until the year 2000. He concluded that \"Polybius\" was an intentional hoax made by Kurt Koller, owner of coinop.org, in order to drive traffic to his website. The hoax capitalized on the popularity of conspiracy theories and the highly viral nature of other recent Internet hoaxes. In Brown's view, the reasons for a 1980s origin are simply retroactive justifications of the hoax's existence which served as inspiration to Koller to craft his tale. He also theorized that people remembering seeing something about it on Usenet in 1994 were misremembering articles on Publius Enigma. Brown also noticed striking similarities between the logo of Polybius, provided by the image on coinop.org in 2000, and other arcade video games like Bubbles and . He concluded that the bottom text is similar to that of Robotron: 2084, and the font in which the logo is made in is almost identical to that of Bubbles, with only the O different and the H flipped. He later stated that this could be a copycat fan of Williams Electronics as both Bubbles and Robotron: 2084 were made by them and that both were released a year later than when Polybius was said to first appear.\n\nThough the original has never been authoritatively located, several video games have been published using the name \"Polybius\", drawing upon the urban legend as inspiration. The claims made in the urban legend of psychoactive or subliminal effects do not apply to these games.\n\nIn 2007, PC freeware developers and arcade constructors Rogue Synapse registered the domain codice_1 and offered a free downloadable game titled \"Polybius\" for PC. The game's design is partly based on a contested description of the \"Polybius\" arcade machine posted on a forum by an individual named Steven Roach who had claimed to have worked on the original.\n\nRogue Synapse's \"Polybius\" is a 2D shooter resembling \"Star Castle\" with extremely intense graphical effects. It also exactly duplicates the distinctive title screen and font referred to in the urban legend, and is compatible with PCs mounted inside arcade cabinets. As a result, fans were able to create \"playable \"Polybius\" arcade machines\" using this version, which fueled the popularity of the urban legend. Most people claiming to have found the \"lost Polybius arcade machine\" are referring to this game.\n\nTo complete the illusion, Rogue Synapse's owner Dr. Estil Vance founded a Texas-based corporation bearing the name \"Sinnesloschen\" (without accents) in 2007. He transferred to it the \"Rogue Synapse\" trademark and a newly registered trademark on \"Polybius\". The author does not make any claim that his version of \"Polybius\" is the authentic original, stating clearly on its page that it is an \"attempt to recreate the \"Polybius\" game as it might have existed in 1981\".\n\nChris Trimiew, owner of Lost Classics, is the author of a homebrew Atari 2600 game named \"Polybius\". Gameplay is not claimed to be based on the original game, and the author expressed doubt that the Atari 2600 hardware would be able to emulate anything close to the claimed original arcade game. It is a simple crosshair-based shooting game resembling \"Star Raiders\", except that occasionally the screen flashes subliminal messages such as \"DEATH\", \"PAIN\", and \"SUFFER\". He marketed the game on October 5, 2013 at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, as a limited run of 30 cartridges.\n\nIn 2016, Llamasoft announced a game called \"Polybius\" for the PlayStation 4 with support for the PlayStation VR. \"Polybius\" was added on the PlayStation store on Tuesday, May 9, 2017. In early marketing, co-author Jeff Minter claimed to have been permitted to play the original \"Polybius\" arcade machine in a warehouse in Basingstoke, England. He later acknowledged that the game was inspired by the urban legend, but does not attempt to reproduce its alleged gameplay.\n\n\"Polybius\" machines have appeared in the background of arcade scenes on television shows and in other media. In the 2006 episode of \"The Simpsons\", titled \"Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em\", a \"Polybius\" cabinet appears in an arcade full of outdated arcade machines from the 1970s and 1980s, bearing a single button and printed with the words \"property of US Government\". The game also appears in the background of two episodes of the 2014 television show \"The Goldbergs\" and a poster advertising the game is present in the local theater, in the comic \"Batman Inc.\" No. 1 (2012), on a T-shirt in Vertigo's 2008 \"House of Mystery\" series, and as the central theme in the fourth episode of season one of the sci-fi series \"Dimension 404\" (2017). A \"Polybius\" arcade cabinet (with an Out of Order sign) can be seen in the background of a video arcade in the 2018 Canadian horror mystery film \"Summer of 84\".\n\nThe \"Polybius\" legend is an integral part of the plot of \"Doomsday Arcade\", a video series hosted by \"Escapist\". It is also used as part of the plot setup in \"Armada: A Novel\" by Ernest Cline.\n\nThe creation and promulgation of the Polybius myth were explored in the Radiotopia podcast \"The Polybius Conspiracy\", which originally aired in 2017. The story blends facts from the period with fictional characters and storylines.\n\nThe music video for the song \"Less Than\", by Nine Inch Nails, features a videogame named Polybius.\n\nThe game was the subject of episodes of \"Game Theory\" in 2012 and was the focus of a Halloween-themed episode of \"Angry Video Game Nerd\" in 2017. It will also be the subject of a feature film by YouTuber Stuart Ashen, labelled \"Ashens and the Polybius Heist\", to be released in 2019.\n\nAn arcade machine of the game can be seen in season 4, episode 29 of the cartoon series Bravest Warriors.\n\n"}
{"id": "25027822", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25027822", "title": "Rape in the United States", "text": "Rape in the United States\n\nRape in the United States is defined by the Department of Justice as \"Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.\" While definitions and terminology of rape vary by jurisdiction in the United States, the FBI revised its definition to eliminate a requirement that the crime involve an element of force.\n\nA 2013 study found that rape may be grossly underreported in the United States. Furthermore, a 2014 study suggested that police departments may eliminate or undercount rapes from official records in part to \"create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime\". For the last reported year, 2013, the prevalence rate for all sexual assaults including rape was 0.1% (prevalence represents the number of victims, rather than the number of assaults since some are victimized more than once during the reporting period). The survey included males and females aged 12+. Since rapes are a subset of all sexual assaults, the prevalence of rape is lower than the combined statistic. Of those assaults, the Bureau of Justice Statistics stated that 34.8% were reported to the police, up from 29.3% in 2004.\n\nIn the United States, at the Federal level, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) definitions are used when collating national crime statistics from states across the US. The UCR's definition of rape was changed on January 1, 2013 to remove the requirement of force against a female and to include a wider range of types of penetration. The new definition reads:\n\nFor 80 years prior to the 2013 change, the UCR's definition of rape was \"carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will\".\n\nAt the state level, there is no uniform legal definition of rape ; instead, each state has their own laws. These definitions can vary considerably, but many of them do not use the term \"rape\" anymore, instead using \"sexual assault\", \"criminal sexual conduct\", \"sexual abuse\", \"sexual battery\", etc.\n\nOne legal definition, which is used by the United States Armed Forces is found in the United States Uniform Code of Military Justice [Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 47X, Section 920, Article 120], defines rape as:\n\nRape prevalence among women in the U.S. (the percentage of women who experienced rape at least once in their lifetime so far) is in the range of 15–20% according to different studies (National Violence against Women survey, 1995, found 17.6% prevalence rate; a 2007 national study for the Department of Justice on rape found 18% prevalence rate.). According to a March 2013 report from the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1995 to 2010, the estimated annual rate of female rape or sexual assault declined 58%, from 5.0 victimizations per 1,000 females age 12 or older to 2.1 per 1,000. Assaults on young women aged 12–17 declined from 11.3 per 1,000 in 1994-1998 to 4.1 per 1,000 in 2005-2010; assaults on women aged 18–34 also declined over the same period, from 7.0 per 1,000 to 3.7.\n\nThe 2016 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), which measures rapes that are known to police, estimated that there were 90,185 rapes reported to law enforcement in 2015. The 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which measures sexual assaults and rapes that may not have been reported to the police, found that there were 431,840 incidents of rape or sexual assault in 2015.\n\nOther government surveys, such as the Sexual Victimization of College Women study, critique the NCVS on the basis it includes only those acts perceived as crimes by the victim, and report a much higher victimization rate. Estimates from other sources typically report much higher levels of both rape and sexual assault than either the NCVS or UCR. A 2010 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found that around 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men had experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. Differences in survey samples, definitions of rape and sexual assault, and the wording of survey questions likely contribute to these differences, and there is no consensus on the best way to measure rape and sexual assault. Both the NCVS and UCR are believed to significantly under-count the number of rapes and sexual assaults that occur.\n\nBased on the available data, 21.8% of American rapes of female victims are gang rapes.\n\nOver the last four decades, rape has been declining. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the adjusted per-capita victimization rate of rape has declined from about 2.4 per 1000 people (age 12 and above) in 1980 (that is, 2.4 persons from each 1000 people 12 and older were raped during that year) to about 0.4 per 1000 people, a decline of about 85%. There are several possible explanations for this, including stricter laws, education on security for women, and a correlation with the rise in Internet pornography.\n\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation have also collected data cases involving victims and perpetrators of rape:\n\nSex offense victims in 2012 (FBI):\nConvicted sex offenders in 2012 (FBI):\n\nMost rape research and reporting to date has concentrated on male-female forms of rape. Male-male and female-male rape has not been as thoroughly researched, and almost no research has been done on female-female rape.\n\nA 1997 report by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 91% of rape victims are female and 9% are male, and that 99% of arrestees for rape are male. However, these statistics are based on reports of \"forced penetration\". This number excludes instances where men were \"made to penetrate\" another person, which are assessed separately under \"sexual violence\". Denov (2004) states that societal responses to the issue of female perpetrators of sexual assault \"point to a widespread denial of women as potential sexual aggressors that could work to obscure the true dimensions of the problem.\"\n\nA 2014 study of college campus rape statistics by the BJS found that 63% of reported rapes against females aged 18 to 24 are done by white males, 19% are done by black males and 10% are done by another race and 8% are unknown. The study used data from 1995-2013, and show that rape in college are independent of race. The National Violence Against Women Survey found that 34% of American Indian female respondents had experienced attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. The rapist was more likely to be a non-Native than a Native.\n\nThe 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that 13.1% of lesbians, 46.1% of bisexual women, and 17.4% of heterosexual women have been raped, physically assaulted, or stalked.\n\nAn examination of the relationship between the victim and his or her attacker indicates the following:\n\nAbout four out of ten sexual assaults take place at the victim's own home.\n\nA 2013 study found that rape is significantly underreported in the United States. Furthermore, a 2014 study determined that police departments eliminate or undercount rapes from official records in part to \"create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime\".\n\nA 2014 report by the Department of Justice estimated that 34.8% cases of sexual assaults are reported to the authorities.\n\nWhen sufficient DNA or injury evidence was procured from a woman's body, she was more likely to follow through with the legal process of prosecution as there was more confidence in a favorable outcome for her. Women who experienced forced sexual assault more frequently were less likely to follow through with the legal process than women who do not experience forced sexual assault frequently.\n\nBased on Department of Justice and FBI data from 2010-2014, RAINN (Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network) calculates that for every 1,000 rapes, 384 are reported to police, 57 result in an arrest, 11 are referred for prosecution, 7 result in a felony conviction, and 6 result in incarceration. This compares to a higher rate at every stage for similar crimes, such as robbery. Out of 1,000 incidents of assault and battery, 627 are reported to police, 255 result in an arrest, 105 are referred to prosecution, 41 result in a felony conviction, and 33 result in incarceration.\n\nDefinitions of rape can vary, and since not all rapes are reported, researchers instead rely on surveys of student and nonstudent populations to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence. Survey design including the questions and the sample quality and scope can also create wide ranges in rates. Research estimates anywhere from approximately 10% to 29% of women have been victims of rape or attempted rape since starting college. Methodological differences, such as the method of survey administration, the definition of rape or sexual assault used, the wording of questions, and the time period studied contribute to these disparities.\n\nOne recent analysis, conducted by U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, represents a longitudinal study of US women from 1995 to 2013. For the year 2013, the study found that women aged 18–24 were more likely to be sexually assaulted at 4.3 per 1,000 (0.4%), than other women at 1.4 per 1,000 (0.1%).\n\nIn an effort to prevent rape on campuses, the Obama administration instituted policies requiring schools to investigate rape cases and adjudicate rape cases under a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard. These policies have been sharply criticized by civil libertarians concerned that they are eroding due process and will lead to wrongful convictions of the innocent. A number of lawsuits have been filed against colleges and universities by students claiming to have been wrongfully expelled for rape they did not commit. In 2016 the colleges with the highest rapes included Brown College and UConn tying for 43 rapes a year. Followed by Dartmouth college with 42, Wesleyan University with 35, University of Virginia with 35, Harvard with 33, University of NC at Charlotte with 32, Rutgers in New Brunswick with 32, University of Vermont with 27 and ending with Stanford with 26 rapes per year.\n\nPrevention programs vary across college campuses. Norms-based programs to inform students that they are not alone in knowledge of rape victims and perpetrators may encourage students to view sexual assault as a larger problem in their community. Additionally, creative campaigns on college campuses that market consent were found to be effective in raising awareness of campus sexual assaults and issues related to this problem.\n\nThe mean annual population was 5,130,004 for students and 8,614,853 for non-students.\n\nThe United States is composed principally of fifty states, each with its own criminal code, as well as the federal jurisdiction. Rape is prosecutable in all U.S. jurisdictions, as well as under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, although the terminology used varies by jurisdiction. Among the alternate names that may be used to prosecute a rape charge, the offense may be categorized as sexual assault, sexual battery, or criminal sexual conduct.\n\nIn the United States, the principle of dual sovereignty applies to rape, as to other crimes. If the rape is committed within the borders of a state, that state has jurisdiction. If the victim is a federal official, an ambassador, consul, or other foreign official under the protection of the United States, or if the crime took place on federal property or involved crossing state borders, or in a manner that substantially affects interstate commerce or national security, then the federal government also has jurisdiction.\n\nIf a crime is not committed within any state, such as in the District of Columbia or on a naval or U.S.-flagged merchant vessel in international waters, then federal jurisdiction is exclusive. In cases where the rape involves both state and federal jurisdictions, the offender can be tried and punished separately for each crime without raising issues of double jeopardy. When a state has jurisdiction over a rape case, as a matter of policy, federal prosecution will not be pursued for a rape charge unless the case presents a matter of federal interest, that interest was not adequately addressed by a state-level prosecution, and the government believes that a federal prosecution will be successful.\n\nJurisdiction issues also complicate the handling of campus rape, due in part to overlapping jurisdiction of campus and local law enforcement, and differences in how various police agencies and prosecutors handle sex offenses.\n\nFederal law does not use the term \"rape\". Rape is grouped with all forms of non-consensual sexual acts under chapter 109a of the United States Code ().\n\nUnder federal law, the punishment for rape can range from a fine to life imprisonment. The severity of the punishment is based on the use of violence, the age of the victim, and whether drugs or intoxicants were used to override consent. If the perpetrator is a repeat offender the law prescribes automatically doubling the maximum sentence.\n\nWhether the victim is an adult or of a child, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the death penalty is not available as a possible penalty if the victim does not die and death was not intended by the defendant. Capital punishment remains available as a penalty where the victim dies, or where the defendant acts with intent to kill the victim but the victim survives.\n\nDifferent categorizations and maximum punishments for rape under federal law a list of rape laws by state.\n\nMedical personnel in the United States of America typically collect evidence for potential rape cases commonly referred to as rape kits. Though normally collected, the rape kits are not always sent off for testing. Reasons given by the police for rape kits not being tested include cost (processing a kit can cost up to $1,500), decisions being made to not prosecute, and victims either recanting or declining to progress the case.\n\nAs identifying injury is an important part of identifying rape victims, particular attention must be given to examinations of patients with dark skin, particularly the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis.\n\nNewspaper \"Northern Virginia Sun\" drew national attention in the late 1970s when owner Herman J. Obermayer said the Sun would print the name of accusers in rape cases that came to trial, out of a sense of \"fairness\" between the two sides. \"Time magazine\" reported that Obermayer's policy was \"hotly denounced by local feminists, police, prosecutors, hospital officials and nearly all the Sun readers who have written or telephoned Obermayer to comment.\" \"Time\" quoted Benjamin C. Bradlee, executive editor of the Washington Post, as saying, \"It's wrong. It's misguided. We wouldn't do it.\"\n\nIt is important for lawyers selecting jury members to be aware of the stigmas surrounding rape victims and to be able to determine which jurors would be able to come to a guilty verdict according to the law, without being clouded by one's preconceived ideas of what a \"typical\" rape victim or perpetrator should look like.\n\nInsurance companies have denied coverage for rape victims, claiming a variety of bases for their actions. In one case, after a victim mentioned she had previously been raped 17 years before, an insurance company refused to pay for her rape exam and also refused to pay for therapy or medication for trauma, because she \"had been raped before\" – indicating a preexisting condition. Some insurance companies have allegedly denied sexual-assault victims mental-health treatment, stating that the service is not medically necessary.\n\nThe 2005 Violence Against Women Act requires states to ensure that victims receive access to a forensic examination free of charge regardless of whether the victim chooses to report a sexual assault to law enforcement or cooperate with the criminal-justice system. All states must comply with the VAWA 2005 requirement regarding forensic examination in order to receive STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program (STOP Program) funds. Under 42 U.S.C. § 3796gg-4, a State is not entitled to funds under the STOP Program unless the State or another governmental entity \"incurs the full out-of-pocket cost of forensic medical exams ... for victims of sexual assault.\" This means that, if no other governmental entity or insurance carrier pays for the exam, states are required to pay for forensic exams if they wish to receive STOP Program funds. The goal of this provision is to ensure that the victim is not required to pay for the exam. The effect of the VAWA 2005 forensic examination requirement is to allow victims time to decide whether to pursue their case. Because a sexual assault is a traumatic event, some victims are unable to decide whether they want to cooperate with law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of a sexual assault. Because forensic evidence can be lost as time progresses, such victims should be encouraged to have the evidence collected as soon as possible without deciding to initiate a report. This provision ensures victims receive timely medical treatment.\n\nDue to bureaucratic mismanagement in some areas, and various loopholes, the victim is sometimes sent a bill anyway, and has difficulty in getting it fixed.\n\nDuring the era of slavery, slave women were frequently sexually abused and raped by slave owners, the sons of slave owners, and overseers. The sexual abuse of slaves that occurred prior to the Civil War was so prevalent that it strongly influenced the genetic make-up of the overwhelming majority of African Americans alive today. White men who raped black women were protected by impunity under Southern society, and children of such unions usually inherited the status of their mothers as slaves. Sexual assaults affected girls as young as 12 years old; a young slave girl named Celia was the frequent target of her master, Robert Newsom's abuse. After having three children with him in a relationship that began when she was only 14, Celia killed her master in self-defense after another attempt at sexual assault. She was found guilty in court and sentenced to death by hanging. Slave women were also subject to sexual abuse by slave traders and were routinely assaulted on slave ships; the perpetrators faced no legal punishment. The rape of slave women was also done by masters to result in a substantial growth of their slaves as property and increase profit. Slave owners would attempt to justify the abuse of black women during slavery through the stereotype of the Jezebel, a seductive woman who wanted to submit to them. According to authors Judith Worell and Pamela Remer, because \"African American women were sexually exploited during slavery\" and because of stereotypes originating from slavery such as the Jezebel, black women \"are not viewed as credible complainants, and are stereotyped (e.g., as promiscuous) in ways that blame them for their rapes.\"\n\nRape, in many US states, before the 1970s, could incur capital punishment. The 1977 Supreme Court case of \"Coker v. Georgia\" held that the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution forbade the death penalty for the crime of rape of an adult woman. The court held that \"Life is over for the victim of the murderer; for the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was, but it is not over, and normally is not beyond repair\".\n\nFeminism politicized and publicized rape as an institution in the late 20th century.\n\nFeminist writings on rape include \"Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape\", by Susan Brownmiller. Concepts such as date rape and marital rape were brought to public attention.\n\nThe murder of Megan Kanka, which occurred in 1994 in New Jersey, when the seven-year-old girl was raped and murdered by her neighbor, has led to the introduction of Megan's Law, which are laws which require law enforcement to disclose details relating to the location of registered sex offenders.\n\nSeveral developments in regard to rape legislation have occurred in the 21st century. Following the intensely publicized case of the 2005 murder of Jessica Lunsford, a 9-year-old girl from Florida who was kidnapped, raped and murdered by a man with prior convictions for sexual attacks, states have started enacting laws referred to as Jessica's Law, which typically mandate life imprisonment with a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years in prison, and lifetime electronic monitoring, for adults convicted of raping children under 12 years. Furthermore, US sex offender registries contain other sanctions, such as housing and presence restrictions.\n\n\n\n"}

In some countries, it is known as National Day or Proclamation Day, or by some other sort of name.\n\nIndia gained its independence on 15 August 1947, after which the process of preparing a constitution was started. The Constitution was passed on 26 November 1949 in the Constituent Assembly. It was adopted on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system. 26 January was selected, because it was this day in 1930 when the Declaration of Indian Independence was passed.\nIndia achieved independence from British rule on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement noted for largely peaceful nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience led by the Indian National Congress. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c. 30), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations): India and Pakistan. India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 28 August 1947, the Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr.B. R. Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates of coming into force of its constitution.\n\nA draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Assembly on 4 November 1947. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document (one in Hindi and one in English) on 24 January 1950. Two days later, it came into effect throughout the nation. The main Republic Day celebration is held in the national capital of New Delhi at the Rajpath before the President of India.\n\nThe Memorial Day of the Republic (\"A köztársaság emléknapja\") commemorates the proclamation of the Republic of Hungary on 1 February 1946. Since 2004, this day is a national commemoration day, not a public or national holiday.\n\nOn 23 February 1970, Guyana was declared a \"cooperative republic\" within the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nIn Pakistan, 23 March marks two related events, the Lahore Resolution in 1940, by the leaders of the All India Muslim League, essentially demanding a separate state (Pakistan) for Muslims of post British India in 1947. The second event was the formal declaration of Pakistan as an Islamic Republic in 1956, having previously held the status of a Dominion. The main events of this day include a full military parade and the awarding of honors at the Presidential Palace by the President.\n\nIranian Islamic Republic Day (روز جمهوری اسلامی) is celebrated on Farvardin 12 of the Iranian calendar to mark the anniversary of the 1979 establishment of the Islamic Republic. Farvardin 12 falls on or around 1 April in the Gregorian calendar.\n\nOn 24 April 1970, the Gambia became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly of Lithuania met for the first time on 15 May 1920. The day is commemorated as Constituent Assembly Day.\n\nOn 22 May 1972, Ceylon changed its name to Sri Lanka, adopted a new constitution, and officially became a republic.\n\nOn 28 May 1918, Azerbaijan declared independence from the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic, thus forming the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic. Azerbaijan was the first democratic parliamentary republic in the Muslim world. The holiday was not celebrated during Soviet times, and it only achieved consistency after the collapse of the USSR.\n\nA decade-long People's Revolution by the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) along with several months of mass protests by all major political parties of Nepal in 2006, culminated in a peace accord and the ensuing elections for the constituent assembly which voted overwhelmingly in favor of the abdication of the last Nepali monarch Gyanendra Shah and the establishment of a federal democratic republic on 28 May 2008.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1994, 31 May was celebrated in South Africa as Republic Day. This practice was discontinued in 1995 following the attainment of majority rule and the re-organisation of public holidays as a consequence. On the last Republic Day, in 1994, South Africa rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nRepublic Day is celebrated on 2 June. It commemorates the referendum of 1946, when the Italian population was called to decide what form of government (monarchy or republic) to give to the country after World War II and the fall of Fascism. After 85 years of monarchy, Italy became a Republic, and the monarchs of the House of Savoy were deposed and exiled. This is one of the most important Italian public holidays which, like 14 July in France and 4 July in the USA, celebrates the birth of the nation. A grand military parade is held in central Rome.\n\n\"Lýðveldisdagurinn\" (literally, \"the Republic's Day\") commemorates the independence of Iceland on 17 June 1944.\n\nOn 1 July 1960, Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana proclaimed a republic and became its first president.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1961, this day was celebrated as Independence Day, in honour of the country's freedom from the United States of America and the establishment of the Third Republic in 1946. In 1962, President Diosdado Macapagal changed the date of Independence Day to 12 June \"in commemoration of our people's declaration of their inherent and inalienable right to freedom and independence\", and designating 4 July as \"Philippine Republic Day\" according to Republic Act № 4166. The current date of 12 June celebrates the First Philippine Republic's secession from the Spanish Empire in 1898, which received limited recognition as the islands were among the possessions that Spain had already ceded to the United States as a consequence of the Spanish–American War.\n\nToday, 4 July is no longer a public holiday though it is sometimes referred to as \"Filipino-American Friendship Day\".\n\nSince 2013, through Proclamation No.5, 23 January is set as the 1899 Philippine Republic Day (\"Araw ng Republikang Filipino, 1899\") and is only a public holiday in Bulacan Province, in honor of the proclamation of the Republic in its capital city of Malolos on 23 January 1899, with ongoing plans to be a national holiday in the coming years in celebration of this event.\n\n14 July 1958 is the day the Hashemite monarchy was overthrown in Iraq by popular forces led by Abdul Karim Kassem, who became the nation's new leader. The event was commemorated in Baghdad with a statue in 14 July Square.\n\nRepublic Day in Tunisia celebrates the abolition of the monarchy by the National Assembly, resulting in the proclamation of the Republic of Tunisia. Habib Bourguiba was chosen to be the first President of Tunisia.\n\nIn the Republic of Macedonia, 2 August is celebrated as the Day of the Republic (, ). It commemorates the Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising of 2 August 1903, and the first meeting of the Anti-fascist Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia on 2 August 1944. The day is also celebrated as St. Elijahs Day, or \"Ilinden\".\n\nThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea was founded on 9 September 1948 following its release from Soviet occupation and a provisional government.\n\nThe national holiday is known locally as the Day of the Foundation of the Republic (\"Korean\": 인민정권 창건일) and is celebrated annually.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago officially became a republic on 1 August 1976. Republic Day is celebrated on 24 September every year because that is when the first parliament met under the new republican constitution, although it was removed from the official calendar of holidays from 1999 to 2001 to make way for Spiritual Baptist/Shouter Liberation Day, celebrated on March 30, before being reinstated in 2002.\n\n5 October in Portugal is known as \"Implantação da República\". It celebrates the proclamation of the First Portuguese Republic in 1910.\n\nThe \"Tag der Republik\" commemorated the establishment of the German Democratic Republic on 7 October 1949. East Germany was dissolved on 3 October 1990.\n\n10 October in Taiwan is a national holiday commemorating the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the symbolic start of the Chinese revolution with the Wuchang Uprising. It is also known as the Double Ten Day.\n\nAlthough the government of Ian Smith declared Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) a republic on 2 March 1970, the annual Republic Day holiday took place on the second-to-last Monday in October. It was abolished in October 1979 by the interim government of Zimbabwe Rhodesia.\n\nOn 29 October 1923, the Turkish constitution was amended and Turkey became a republic. This formally declared the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Republic Day (Turkish: \"Cumhuriyet Bayramı\") is celebrated throughout Turkey every year. Commemorative events usually begin in the afternoon on the previous day. In observance of the holiday, government offices and schools close for a day. Also, there are fireworks shows in all cities of Turkey.\n\nOn 11 November 1968, the monarchy of the Maldives was replaced by a republic.\n\nOn 15 November 1889, in the city of Rio de Janeiro (the Brazilian capital at that time), a military coup led by Field Marshal Deodoro da Fonseca overthrew Emperor Pedro II and declared Brazil a republic.\n\nOn 15 November 1983, Northern Cyprus was proclaimed.\n\nOn 28 November 1958, Chad became an autonomous state within the French Community.\n\nOn 29 November 1943, the Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia established the foundations of post-war Yugoslavia as a federal republic, which was officially proclaimed on the same date in 1945. Republic Day (local name: \"Dan Republike\" or Дан Републике) marked the occasion two consecutive days, 29 and 30 November, and was likely the most important holiday (the other two-day holidays were New Year and May Day).\n\nIn elementary schools first graders were inducted into the Pioneer Movement on or around Republic Day. Employees merged the holiday with weekends and extra days off to form weekends of three, four or even five days. Urban dwellers took the occasion to visit their relatives in the country, who marked the event with pig slaughter and the ensuing feast.\n\nIn the 1980s, as the authority of the central government and League of Communists eroded, dissenters targeted Republic Day celebrations for criticism. In 1987, Bosnian garage rock band \"Zabranjeno pušenje\" published a song entitled \"Dan Republike\", in which they criticized the state of the economy and protested the general indifference to the ideals behind the holiday. The band had to change some of the lyrics before being allowed to air the song.\n\nIn 1990, Slovenia was the first federal republic to cease observing the holiday. Other seceded republics followed suit as Yugoslavia dissolved. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia kept the holiday until 2002.\n\nThe date \"29.XI.1943\" figured prominently on the Yugoslav coat of arms.\n\nOn 1 December 1958, Ubangi-Shari became an autonomous territory within the French Community as the Central African Republic.\n\nOn 11 December 1958, Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French Community. This is commemorated in Burkina Faso as the Proclamation of the Republic.\n\nKenya gained independence from the United Kingdom on 12 December 1963. For one year, its head of state was Elizabeth II as Queen of Kenya. It then became a republic and Jomo Kenyatta became its first president.\n\nOn 13 December 1974, the constitution of Malta was substantially revised, transforming the State of Malta into a republic within the Commonwealth. The British monarch was no longer \"Reġina ta' Malta\" (Queen of Malta) and the new head of state was President Sir Anthony Mamo. This occasion is marked every year as \"Republic Day\" (Maltese: \"Jum ir-Repubblika\") in Malta. The monument of Republic Day is at Marsa.\n\nIn the waning days of Soviet rule, individual republics of the Soviet Union sought greater autonomy. The Soviet Union agreed in early 1990 to give up its monopoly of political power. Following the lead of Lithuanian SSR, Russian SFSR and others, Kazakh SSR declared its sovereignty on 25 October 1990, and Kazakhstan subsequently became independent on 16 December 1991 as the Soviet Union collapsed. 16 December is now commemorated as Republic Day (), a public holiday in Kazakhstan.\n\n18 December 1958 is commemorated in the Republic of Niger as Republic Day, the national holiday. Although not the date of formal independence from France, 18 December marks the founding of the Republic and creation of the Presidency of the Republic of Niger, following the constitutional changes of the French Fifth Republic, and the elections of 4 December 1958 held across the French colonial possessions. Nigerians consider this date to be the founding of their nation. Between 18 December 1958 and 5 August 1964, Niger remained a semi-autonomous republic within the French Community.\n\nThe 18th is celebrated in Niger with official festivals and appearances of political leaders, as well as public parties and festivities.

Saturday is a traditional day of prayer for the dead, because Christ lay dead in the Tomb on Saturday.\nThere are several Soul Saturdays throughout the year:\n\nIn the Bulgarian Orthodox Church there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel, i.e. on 8 November (instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday).\nThese days are devoted to prayer for departed relatives and others among the faithful who would not be commemorated specifically as saints. The Divine Services on these days have special hymns added to them to commemorate the departed. There is normally a Panikhida (Memorial Service) either after the Divine Liturgy on Saturday morning or after Vespers on Friday evening, for which Koliva (a dish made of boiled wheatberries or rice and honey) is prepared and placed on the Panikhida table. After the Service, the priest blesses the Koliva. It is then eaten as a memorial by all present.\n\nAll Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics observe Soul Saturdays on Meatfare Saturday (i.e., two Saturdays before the beginning of Great Lent); the second, third and fourth Saturdays of Great Lent; and the Saturday before Pentecost.\nOthers, such as the Serbian Orthodox, observe commemorations of the dead on the Saturdays before 8 August and before 24 October. The Russians observe memorials on the Saturdays closest to 26 October (Saint Demetrius) and 23 September (Conception of St. John the Forerunner).\n\nAnother Memorial Day, Radonitsa, does not fall on a Saturday, but on either Monday or Tuesday of the second week after Pascha (Easter). Radonitsa does not have special hymns for the dead at the Divine Services. Instead, a Panikhida will follow the Divine Liturgy, and then all will bring paschal foods to the cemeteries to greet the departed with the joy of the Resurrection.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17038785", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17038785", "title": "Saturday sports paper", "text": "Saturday sports paper\n\nIn the UK, a Saturday sports paper was a local newspaper published on a Saturday evening containing information about sports matches played on that day. Throughout most of the twentieth century they were very popular, representing one of the few up to date sources of information available to sports fans. Gradually, circulations fell and all had ceased publication by December 2017.\n\nSaturday sports papers were published locally, with a different paper produced in each area covering local teams in depth. They were often connected to the local newspaper. In Cardiff, for example, the Western Mail and Echo published the South Wales Sport Echo (previously the Football Echo.) In all areas Saturday sports papers were commonly nicknamed according to the colour of the paper they were printed on, which usually was not white. The \"sports pink\" or \"green 'un\" were common names.\n\nMost Saturday sports papers focus on football, providing match reports of games involving local teams and a full listing of final scores. Many also cover other traditional sports such as rugby or cricket and some have expanded into covering newer sports such as ice hockey. Saturday sports papers are published as soon after full-time as possible. Cardiff's South Wales Sports Echo was available to buy within twenty minutes of the end of the game, featuring half-time reports and full-time scores, with a fuller edition later in the evening. Many sports fans have fond memories of going out to buy a Saturday sports paper as soon as it was printed to find out how their team had done.\n\nBefore the advent of radio, Saturday sports papers were the only way most fans had of finding out sporting results and consequently they were very popular, some with circulations of more than 50,000. Since the start of the 21st century, however, Saturday sports papers declined dramatically in sales. Birmingham's \"Sports Argus\", which used to be the biggest selling Saturday sports paper in the country, was one of many to be forced to close, publishing its last issue on 13 May 2006. Those that remained saw declining sales or switched to providing websites.\n\nA number of factors have adversely affected the popularity of Saturday sports papers. Televised sport means that matches (particularly football) frequently do not take place on Saturday afternoons so they cannot be adequately covered by a Saturday evening publication. Another issue is the rise of alternative sources of information. The internet, mobile phones and teletext services also allowed sports fans to follow their team's progress without the need for Saturday sports papers.\n\nThe Sheffield Star Green 'Un closed in the summer of 2013 and the Sunderland Echo Pink followed at the end of the same year. This left only two Saturday sports papers in existence - Portsmouth's Sports Mail which had only just been resurrected for the 2013-14 season (having originally run from 1903 until 2012) and the Southern Daily Echo's Sports Pink. \n\nThe Sports Mail moved its publication date to a Sunday in October 2016. The Southern Daily Echo's Sports Pink therefore remained the final Saturday Sports paper until it too closed on 9 December 2017.\n\n"}

The town of Soest opposed this attempt on 5 June 1444 by accepting a new suzerain, John I, the Duke of Cleves-Mark, who guaranteed the town its old rights as well as new ones. As a result Emperor Frederick III imposed the imperial ban on the town. The victory of the town (as a result of the Archbishop of Cologne abandoning his attempt) meant that Soest had \"de facto\" more freedom than a free imperial city until it was annexed by Prussia, but at the same time it had to forfeit its economic power because it was now an enclave within Cologne's territory.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21454663", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21454663", "title": "Somali Civil War (2009–present)", "text": "Somali Civil War (2009–present)\n\nThe 2009–present phase of the Somali Civil War is concentrated in southern Somalia. It began in early February 2009 with the conflict between the forces of the Federal Government of Somalia, assisted by African Union peacekeeping troops, and various militant terrorist groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen fighting between the Sufi Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a and Al-Shabaab. \n\nOn 16 October 2011, the Kenyan Army crossed the border into Somalia in Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab. It aimed to seize Kismayo and set up a buffer zone against Al-Shabaab. In 2012, Kismayo was captured.\n\nIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside.\n\nIn 2017, the 14 October and 28 October Mogadishu bombings killed more than 500 and injured more than 400.\n\nEstablished in 2004 and internationally recognized, the Transitional Federal Government's (TFG) support in Somalia was waning until the United States-backed 2006 intervention by the Ethiopian military, which helped drive out the rival Islamic Courts Union (ICU) in Mogadishu and solidify the TFG's rule. Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al-Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an underequipped African Union (AU) peacekeeping force. A power sharing deal ensued between an Islamist splinter group led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia Djibouti faction (ARS-D) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in Djibouti. Al-Shabaab, which had separated from the moderate Islamists of the insurgency, rejected the peace deal and continued to take territories. It was joined by Hizbul Islam, which is an amalgamation of four Islamist group including the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia – Asmara faction. Another Islamist group, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, which was allied with the TFG and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al-Shabaab and take over towns as well although they have been effective only in the central region of Galguduud, where they ousted al-Shabaab from most of the region.\n\nAfter the parliament took in 275 officials from the moderate Islamist opposition, ARS leader Sheikh Ahmed was elected TFG President on 31 January 2009. Since then, the al-Shabaab radical Islamists have accused the new TFG President of accepting the secular transitional government and have continued the civil war since he arrived in Mogadishu at the presidential palace in early February 2009.\n\nOn 4 February 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys' Eritrean branch of the ARS merged and created the group Hisbi Islam, to fight the new government of Sharif Ahmed. Al-Shabaab also vowed to fight the government. On 8 February 2009, they declared war on the new government of Sharif Ahmed and the AU peace-keepers.\n\nNew TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on 7 February 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government.\n\nOn 8 February, heavy fighting broke out in southern Mogadishu. al-Shabaab leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur) met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to Mogadishu, while Omar Iman rejected the president. During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce Sharia Law in Somalia, which is now the radical groups' main demand. However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former Al-Shabab spokesman, denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned Nigeria against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab views the AU peace keepers as occupying forces and will continue fighting them until they withdraw from the country.\n\nOn 10 February, al-Shabaab launched an offensive to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital where they started a battle against government forces.\nIn Galmudug, Clan militia took the town of Masagaway from al-Shabaab. There was also fighting in Warsheekh.\n\nOn 12 February, the spokesman for al-Shabaab, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. He also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an \"apostate\" government. The same day, they vowed war against the new government.\n\nOn 22 February, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen.\n\nAt the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the north-west, in fighting that killed another 20 people: 10 TFG soldiers, 6 insurgents and 4 civilians.\n\nOn 28 February, it appeared that Hisbi Islam would sign a ceasefire with the Transitional Federal Government. However, by 1 March, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President Sharif Ahmed having agreed to proposals for a truce and having offered to accept the implementation of Sharia Law but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so.\n\nOn 6 May, al-Shabaab announced that it would continue the war even if AMISOM withdrew.\n\n25 May, the government announced an immediate blockade on airstrips and seaports under insurgent control to stop the flow of weapons reaching them.\nOn 7 May, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced. By 11 May, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking over most of the capital. Fighting continued until 14 May and, though they came close, the rebels didn't manage to overthrow the government. There were new rounds of fighting all through August.\n\n16 May, al-Shabaab captured the strategic town of Jowhar, which connects Mogadishu with central Somalia.\n5 June, Hizbul Islam captured Wabho in one of the largest battles of the war, which left 123 combatants killed. It was also rumoured Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys was injured in this battle.\n\nOn 19 June, the transitional parliament speaker Sheikh Adan Mohamed Nuur Madobe asked the international community to send foreign troops to Somalia within the following 24 hours. He stated that the government's power is on the verge of being defeated by Islamist forces in the Somali capital. The Cabinet declared a state of emergency and Somalia asked for help from neighbors Kenya, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Yemen. Ethiopia refused saying intervention needs an international mandate. On 21 June, a spokesman for the al-Shabaab Islamists said they would fight any foreign troops. Al-Qaeda also made threats against Kenyan intervention.\n\n22 June, Somali President Sheikh Sharif Ahmed declared state of emergency in the country as a new round of fighting in Mogadishu left 12 dead and 20 injured. Hundreds were said to be fleeing the city\n4 July, Sheik Abdinasir Jalil, a former commander of the training for ICU administration in Beledweyn town joined Hizbul Islam with his men and vowed to fight TFG forces in the city and attack Ethiopian forces in El-gal village, which lies 18 km from Beledweyn. He said that the government officials want to bring Ethiopian troops inside town and that is the reason they switched sides. Former ICU officials who joined Hizbul Islam, held a press conference and announced that the ICU administration in Hiraan had collapsed as they joined the insurgents. Sheikh Ibrahim Yusuf, a top security commander in Beledweyn, also defected along with his forces. General Muktar Hussein Afrah was sent to Beledweyn along with TFG troops and put in charge there by the TFG as the ICU administration had collapsed. Many ICU officials including MPs resigned that day next to Sheikh Abdinasir Jalil Ahmed (head of training) and Sheikh Ibrahim Yusuf (head of security); Sheik Osman Abdulle Barqadle, the army commander of Ugas Khalif airport, and Sheik Abdullahi Garamgaram, the deputy chief of the emergency forces also resigned.\n\nIn response, TFG forces led by general Muktar Hussein Afrah started military manoeuvers in the East side of the city.\n\n6 July, Sheikh Moktar Ali Zubeyr, the Amir of al-Shabaab gave government forces an ultimatum of 5 days to hand over their weapons. The ultimatum was rejected by Indho Ade.\n\n17 July, two French security advisors to the government were captured by insurgents. The Somali government gave permission for French commandos to launch operations inside Somalia to free the 2 French nationals that held by al-Shabaab. On 22 July, French warships and helicopters were seen near the ports of Mogadishu and Marka as France declared they would undertake military operations to free the two French military advisers who had been captured by insurgents. One hostage, Marc Aubriere, escaped a month later in August 2009. The second, Denis Allex, was seen in a video released in June 2010 asking for assistance to effect his release.\n\nOn 15 September, a helicopter raid conducted by the US military killed 6, including a key Al-Qaeda member, Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan.\n\nThe armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed \"Madoobe\" and al-Shabaab, over a power sharing agreement in Kisimayo. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place. This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as its ARS-A and JABISO factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan \"Turki\" refusing to back Ahmad \"Madoobe\" and instead siding with al-Shabaab.\n\nOn 1 October, heavy fighting broke out. By the afternoon, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with dozens of casualties reported. At least 17 people were killed in a series of battles overnight on 5 October. A Hizbul Islam spokesman claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle. The battle was decisively won by al-Shabaab which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city.\n\nThroughout November 2009, fighting between the two factions continued in Southern Somalia and as a result insurgent attacks in Mogadishu targeting TFG and AMISOM forces decreased. However Sheikh Ahmad Madobe's forces were soon overpowered by al-Shabaab and its local allies and forced to withdraw from the Lower Jubba region and most of Southern Somalia. In February 2010, Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades declared a merge with al-Shabaab. He encouraged other groups in Hizbul Islam to also join al-Shabaab.\n\nIn early 2010 the two groups clashed in Hiran region, in central Somalia. This battle was also won by al-Shabaab which took control of the region. In late 2010 they also expelled Hizbul Islam from Bay region after seizing control of Bur Hakab, after a two days battle in which 30 militants were killed. In Lower Shabelle region al-Shabaab seized control of Hizbul Islam strongholds: Furuqley, Farsooley and Dugulle villages and then started preparing an offensive in Afgooye, the last town Hizbul Islam controlled in the region. Soon after Hizbul Islam was forced to surrender the Luuq District in Gedo region to al-Shabaab, after which it was announced that Hizbul Islam would merge with al-Shabaab. From mid-December al-Shabaab fighters started taking over Hizbul Islam positions. Hizbul Islam fighters also started entering al-Shabaab controlled areas of Mogadishu. The merge was confirmed on 20 December, when Hizbul Islam Chairman Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys and Sheikh Mohammad Osman Arus, the organisation's official spokesman, surrendered to al-Shabaab and disbanded the organisation.\n\nGovernment officials from the Galmudug administration in the north-central Hobyo district also reportedly attempted to use pirate gangs as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents from southern Somalia's conflict zones. Other pirates are alleged to have reached agreements of their own with the Islamist groups, although a senior commander from the Hizbul Islam militia vowed to eradicate piracy by imposing sharia law when his group briefly took control of Harardhere in May 2010 and drove out the local pirates.\n\nAn early 2011 offensive was dubbed by AU Representative Wafula Wamunyinyi as the \"Battle of Gashandiga.\"\n\nOn 20 February 2011, it was reported that AMISOM troops destroyed a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, and killed six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu. Two AMISOM troops died in those battles.\n\nOn 21 February, at least 20 people, including TFG policemen were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in Mogadishu.\n\nBetween 21 and 22 February, twelve people were killed in heavy shelling in Mogadishu.\n\nOn 25 February, 15 people were killed as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory in Mogadishu. Additionally, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers.\n\nOn 26 February, an offensive by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers was opened in the southern Somali town of Bula Hawo. Until 28 February, 33 people were killed in TFG and Ethiopian shelling.\n\nBy 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits, while the Bakaara Market, where many of the goods were bound to be sold, was controlled by the insurgents. It was reported that by 5 March, up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes. Of those, 43 Burundian and 10 Ugandan.\n\nBy 16 March, AMISOM was bolstered by an additional 1,000 peacekeepers to assist in the TFG's renewed offensive against al-Shabaab, bringing the total manpower of AMISOM to nearly 9,000.\n\nOn 6 August 2011, the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of Baidoa. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have suggested that the pullout may at least in part have been caused by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization.\n\nAfter their withdrawal, al-Shabaab has however continued hit and run tactics in the North of the city as they vowed to continue guerilla attacks in Mogadishu. On 4 October 2011, a suicide bomb on a lorry detonated and killed more than 70 people near a compound housing several government ministries. Two weeks later a car bomb killed at least two people.\n\nOn 11 October 2011, AU troops claimed to have driven the remnants of al-Shabaab out of the city. As of November 2012, Mogadishu was still firmly in AMISOM and TFG hands, although the city continued to suffer from suicide bomb attacks.\n\nOn 2 to 3 September, fighting was reported in Puntland that resulted in the deaths of up to 60 people, including 8 Puntland soldiers and 40 Al-Shabaab militants, with Insurgents being repelled. Al-Shabaab claimed on 7 September that they have captured 2 Kenyan troops who were on a surveillance mission near the Kenyan-Somalian Border. Puntland forces captured 18 members of Al-Shabaab in counter-terrorism operations on 8 September.\n\nAl-Shabaab attacked the southern town of Elwaq on 10 September 2011, resulting in the deaths of 12 insurgents and soldiers. The next day, Somali troops fought back, retaking the town after militants fled on captured technicals. The bodies of 30 militants were later found, some of them children. Conversely, Al-Shabaab claimed they killed around 70 government aligned troops and captured 10 technicals.\n\nThe Burundian military lost 51 soldiers in October, causing anger among Burundians, who believe that their country is sacrificing too much. Many Burundians have urged other AU members to contribute troops to the Somalia mission. Nigeria, Djibouti, and Guinea have indicated sending troops, but all have yet to contribute.\n\nOn 4 September 2012 the Kenyan Navy shelled Kismayo. This was part of an AU offensive to capture the city from al-Shabab fighters. The harbour was shelled two times and the airport three times. According to a UN report the export of charcoal through Kismayo is a major source of income for al-Shabab.\n\nOn 28 September 2012, the Somali National Army assisted by AMISOM troops and Ras Kamboni militia launched an assault on Kismayo, Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold. The allied forces reportedly managed to re-capture much of the city from the insurgents.\n\nIn August 2014, the Somali government-led Operation Indian Ocean was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside. On 1 September 2014, a U.S. drone strike carried out as part of the broader mission killed Al-Shabaab leader Moktar Ali Zubeyr. U.S. authorities hailed the raid as a major symbolic and operational loss for Al-Shabaab, and the Somali government offered a 45-day amnesty to all moderate members of the militant group. Political analysts also suggested that the insurgent commander's death will likely lead to Al-Shabaab's fragmentation and eventual dissolution.\n\nAt the end of the month of July 2015, AMISOM and Somalia National Army regained many villages and major towns of Baardhere and Dinsoor.\n\nOn 15 January 2016, Al Shabaab attacked a Kenyan-run AMISOM base in El Adde Somalia, overrunning the compound and killing approximately 60 soldiers. Al Shabaab then regained the important town of Marka, 45 km from the capital, and the port of Gard in Puntland region (March 2016). The resurgence of Al Shabaab could entail serious implications for the humanitarian sector.\n\nOn 5 March 2016, U.S. airstrikes carried out by aircraft and unmanned drones killed more than 150 Al-Shabaab terrorists at a terrorist training camp called \"Camp Raso\", located about 120 miles north of Mogadishu as they were completing \"training for a large-scale attack\" according to a Pentagon spokesman. The camp had been under surveillance for some time before the strike. In the early hours of 9 March 2016, U.S. special forces and Somali national army special forces killed between 1 and 15 Al-Shabaab terrorists in a heliborne-attack on the Al-Shabaab-controlled town of Awdhegele, as well as capturing an undisclosed number of high-value Al-Shabaab figures the mililtants were training for a major operation against coalition forces.\n\nOn 11/12 April 2016, two U.S. airstrikes on Al-Shabaab targets in the town of Kismayo killed about a dozen suspected militants who posed a \"imminent threat\" to American troops in the country. As of May 2016, roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia, with their headquarters at the airport in Mogadishu; advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab. Also in that month, U.S. personnel helped those forces plan an operation against illegal checkpoints.\n\nOn 12 May 2016, a small group of U.S. military advisers accompanied some Ugandan soldiers during a raid on an illegal taxation checkpoint just west of Mogadishu, when the Ugandans came under fire from 15-20 al Shabaab militants, the U.S. commander on the ground called in a \"defensive\" airstrike, killing five militants and wounding two more. Two days previously, the U.S. provided helicopters and advise and assist in support of a Somali military mission against a group of al Shabaab militants, which one defense official said was also defensive because they had intelligence that the al Shabaab fighters were planning an attack on the AMISOM installation nearby. No word on how many al Shabaab were killed or wounded in that operation. On 13 May, a U.S. strike targeted nine al-Shabab militants, three of them were allegedly killed.\n\nOn the night of 31 May 2016, two senior Al-Shabaab operatives; Mohamud Dulyadeyn, the plotter behind the Garissa University attack in April 2015 and Maalim Daud, head of Al-Shabaab's intelligence hit squads and another 16 members from Al-Shabaab were killed by the Somali National Army and anti-terror partners. Defense Department spokeswoman Lt. Col. Michelle L. Baldanza told CNN \"U.S. forces supported this Somali-led operation in an advise-and-assist role,\".\n\nOn 1 June 2016, Al Shabaab militants attacked with a car bomb on the gate of Ambassador Hotel in Mogadishu, Somalia. At least 15 people have been killed in the attack, among 10 civilian pedestrians and two members of parliament near the gate. Also that day, the Pentagon announced that it had conducted an airstrike that killed a senior Al-Shabaab leader in Somalia on 27 May. On 3 August 2016, a contingent of elite American troops acting as military advisers assisted Somali commandos in an assault on an al-Shabaab checkpoint in Saakow, as the Somali-led force approached the checkpoint the militants opened fire, a gun battle ensued that resulted in 3 militants killed.\n\nOn 29 September 2016, a Somalian regional government demanded an explanation from the United States after an airstrike killed 22 civilians and other soldiers instead of the targeted al-Shabab militants in Galmudug. The \"Military Times\" also reported that on 26 September a bomb-manufacturing network linked al-Shabaab attacked a small team of U.S. and Somali troops, who were conducting an operation near Kismayo, with small-arms fire. A Pentagon spokesman said the U.S. military \"conducted a self-defense strike to neutralize the threat and in doing so killed nine enemy fighters.\" Also on 28 September, near the town of Galkayo, a Somali army unit conducting counterterrorism operations nearby, when the Somali soldiers came under fire from al-Shabab militants. The Somali soldiers engaged them, then broke contact and rejoined with their nearby American advisers and soon afterwards the militants \"began to maneuver in an offensive manner\" so the U.S. conducted a self-defense airstrike, killing 4 militants.\n\nIn late March 2017, President Donald Trump signed off a new strategy granting AFRICOM more freedom in counterterrorist operations.\n\n\"Stars and Stripes\" reported that in addition to the stepping-up of airstrikes, US special forces on the frontlines with Somali forces have also been increased, conventional US troops give lessons in building defense institutions, with added support from other nations.\n\n\"CNN\" reported that General Thomas Waldhauser, commander of AFRICOM, told reporters in April that the US seeks to help Somali security forces gain the ability to provide for their own security by 2021.\n\nThe \"New York Times\" reported that on 4 May 2017, a US Navy SEAL team partnered with Somali National Army forces, carried out a mission on an al-Shabaab-occupied complex around west of Mogadishu. \"Fox News\" reported that they targeting what Pentagon spokesperson Captain Jeff Davis said was a \"group of people\" associated with attacks on Mogadishu. The \"New York Times\" reported that Defence Department officials said that Somali forces were to have led the operation, with the SEALs hanging back in an advise, assist and accompany role, however Brig.Gen. David J. Furness, the commander of the military’s task force for the Horn of Africa, said that American and Somali forces were traveling together in a single group. Whilst approaching the complex, the militants opened fire and the mission was aborted, Senior chief petty officer Kyle Milliken was killed, 2 other SEALs and an interpreter were wounded. Captain Jeff Davis said that the mission \"resulted in the death of three Shabaab operatives including Moalin Osman Abdi Badil,\" the group quickly returned to the aircraft that had taken it to the area and was exfilled. Davis described Badil as an al-Shabaab leader responsible for gathering information on troop movements in order to support attacks on Somali and African Union forces and that he had been linked to the death of several soldiers and at least one civilian.\n\n\"CNN\" reported that on 11 June 2017, that a US air strike killed 8 al-Shabaab militants in Sakow, the president of Somalia said that \"This was a successful strike which destroyed a key Al-Shabaab command and supply hub,\" and that \"This will ultimately disrupt the enemy's ability to conduct new attacks within Somalia.\" \"CNN\" reported that on 23 July 2017, The US carried out a targeted airstrike an al-Shabaab regional commander in Banadir. \"Fox News\" reported that on 30 July 2017, a US strike near Tortoroow in southern Somalia which was coordinated with regional partners as a direct response to al-Shabaab's actions which included attacks on Somali forces, killed Ali Jabal, who was considered a senior al-Shabaab terrorist and was responsible for leading forces operating in the Mogadishu and Banadiir area, including planning and carrying out attacks in Mogadishu.\n\n\"ABC\" reported that on 10 August 2017, airstrikes conducted by drones in Banaadir in a joint operation against al-Shabaab fighters, killing a high-level al-Shabaab leader. The airstrikes marked the fourth offensive airstrike against al-Shabaab since the new authorisation in March. \"CNN\" reported that on 17 August 2017, the US conducted a \"self defense\" drone strike in Jilib after a joint US-Somali force, consisting of Somali troops and US advisors, came under direct attack by al-Shabaab militants and a firefight ensued, 7 militants were killed.\n\n\"Military.com\" reported that on 3 November 2017, that a US drone conducted two airstrikes against Islamic State in Somalia, at least six missiles were used which struck in Buqa, 37 miles north of Qandala, AFRICOM said in a statement that \"several terrorists\" were killed and that the strikes were carried out in coordination with Somalia's government; marking the first time the US has conducted airstrikes against ISS terrorists in Somalia. \"CNN\" reported that US drone aircraft conducted 5 strikes between 9 and 12 November against al-Shabaab and ISS linked militants, killing 36 al-Shabaab and 4 ISS terrorists. One of the strikes killed an al-Shabaab terrorist who had attacked a joint US-Somali military convoy in Gaduud. \"CNN\" reported that a US airstrike on a camp 125 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed more than 100 al-Shabaab militants; the US now estimates there are between 3,000 and 6,000 al-Shabaab fighters and less than 250 ISIS operatives in Somalia \"Military Times\" reported that on 14 November, a US drone strike roughly 60 miles northwest of Mogadishu killed several al-Shabaab militants.\n\n\"CNN\" reported that on 24 December, a US airstrike in southern Somalia killed 13 al-Shabaab terrorists.\n\nThe African Union has deployed more than 16,000 soldiers to Somalia, mandated to support transitional governmental structures, implement a national security plan, train the Somali security forces, and assist in creating a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian aid. As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the Transitional Federal Government's forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants.\n\nAMISOM was created by the African Union's Peace and Security Council on 19 January 2007 with an initial six month mandate. On 21 February 2007 the United Nations Security Council approved the mission's mandate. Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorised by the United Nations Security Council.\n\nAMISOM's UN mandate was extended for a further six months in August 2008 by UNSCR 1831. The AMISOM’s mandate has been extended each period that it has been up for review. It is now set to be reviewed again on 16 January 2013.\n\nOn 12 November 2013, the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 2124 (2013) extending AMISOM's mandate from 28 February 2014 to 31 October 2014. Acting upon the force's request, the resolution also increases AMISOM's maximum authorized strength from 17,731 to 22,126 troops.\n\nThe force, which has been reportedly engaged in fighting in Mogadishu and throughout the country, has reportedly suffered significant casualties during their mission, although no precise figures have been issued by the contributing countries.\n\nThe United National Development Program for Somalia spends about $50 million each year, though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER). As of October 2010, the U.S. State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body.\n\nIn January 2013, the U.S. announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the Department of State, the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process. In addition to diplomatic ties; roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab.\n\nAt the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093 during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year arms embargo on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons. On 9 April 2013, the U.S. government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government. At the request of the Somali authorities and AMISOM, the U.S. military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces.\n\nThe United Kingdom is also involved in combating Islamist terrorists in Somalia, since 2009, members of the Special Air Service and the Special Reconnaissance Regiment have been deployed to Camp Lemonnier to conduct counter-terrorist operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia; they have carrying out surveillance missions of Britons believed to be travelling to Somalia for terrorist training and they are also working with US counterparts observing and \"targeting\" local terror suspects. They have also been carrying out a similar role in Yemen. In May 2016, it was reported that 70 UK military personnel have arrived in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab as part of a UN peacekeeping mission; 10 soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical support to AMISOM. Personnel will also be sent to South Sudan to carry out a similar role.\n\nOn 16 October 2016, the \"New York Times\" reported that American officials said the White House had quietly broadened the president’s authority for the use of force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. SEAL Team 6 has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in Puntland, before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington Think tank) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle, U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country.\n\nOn 30 March 2017, CNN reported that US President Donald Trump signed off a decision by the White House which approved a new strategy granting AFRICOM the authority to step up counterterrorism strikes in Somalia; under the new strategy, the US military will now be able to conduct precision airstrikes in support of the Somalia National Army and AMISOM forces. The new authorization designates some regions of Somalia an \"area of active hostilities,\" freeing counterterrorism strikes there from restrictions governing other strikes outside the areas; an official said that the designated areas will not include Mogadishu and Puntland. Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon Spokesman said that \"The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabaab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region.\" Another official said that the legal basis for the new authority is the 2001 AUMF. In mid-April 2017, it was reported that 40 soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somalia Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army's logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that \"This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics\" and that the Somali government requested the training.\n\nOn 16 February, Somali MP Mohamud Sayid Adan, former Mogadishu mayor Mohamed Omar Habeeb and local police officer Hassan Dhicisow, were arrested by Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolow in Gedo region.\n\nOn 28 May, 2 Ethiopian soldiers, 1 Ethiopian civilian, 2 Somali soldiers, 4 Somali civilians (working for the government) and 4 Somali insurgents were killed when insurgents attacked a convoy carrying Omar Hashi Aden, who was returning from his visit to Ethiopia.\n\nOn 31 May, Ethiopian forces launched search and seizure operations in Hiraan, in Kalaberyr village, near Beledweyn.\n\nOn 12 June, Ethiopian forces with several battle wagons entered in Balanbal town in Galgudud and set up military bases.\n\nOn 14 June, the Ethiopian military said it had come to fight foreign mujahedin which the military described as \"foreign enemies of Ethiopia and Somalia\" and launched operations to search for them in Balanbal town which they control. Sheik Hassan Ya'qub Ali, head of the information affairs for Islamic administration in Kisimayo warned the Ethiopians that \"there is no candy and dates to eat from here in Somalia. But the men who chased you forcibly from the country are here in Somalia.\"\n\nThe suicide bombing on 18 June targeted a meeting between TFG and Ethiopian commanders.\n\nOn 19 June, Ethiopian forces entered Bakool and reached Elberde town. They withdrew after holding talks with local clan elders.\n\n22 June, Ethiopian forces started launching search and seizure operations in Kala-beyrka intersection in Hiran region.\n\nThe Ethiopian government then announced it would not intervene without an international mandate.\n\n30 June, Ethiopian forces entered El-gal and Ilka'adde villages which are less than 20 km north of regional capital Beledweyn. Reports from Kala-beyrka intersection say that more extra troops from Ethiopia crossed from the border.\n\n4 July, Ethiopians withdrew from their bases in Banabal town in Galgudug.\n\n18 July, Ethiopian forces vacated their bases in Yed Village in insurgent-controlled Bakool region.\n\nDuring the weekend of 29–30 August, Ethiopian forces advanced to Beledweyne, supporting a government offensive on the insurgent part of, Beledweyne. They withdrew on 31 August. The assault on Beledweyne by government forces came as the TFG governor of Hiraan (belonging to Sharif Ahmed's ARS-Djibouti faction), Sheikh Abdirahman Ibrahim Ma'ow, which controls the other part of Beledweyne, withdrew his administration's support for the TFG.\n\n19 March, Mohammed wali Odowa, spokesman of Hizbul Islam's Hiraan administration in Beledweyne, threatened that Hizbul Islam forces would attack any Ethiopian forces which entered Hizbul Islam controlled territories in Hiraan.\n\n20 May, Ethiopian forces seized control of the previously al-Shabaab held towns of Yeed and Elbarde, in Bakool region. Al-Shabaab had captured Elbarde from the TFG on 20 April.\n\nOn 18 July, Ethiopian forces withdrew from all their bases in Hiraan and Bakool regions. Ethiopian forces had held these territories for two months, during which they clashed several times with al-Shabaab forces which control most of Hiraan. Before they withdrew they released over 20 lorries which used to travel between the South and Central regions of Somalia.\n\nOn 1 August, 27,000 Ethiopian troops entered Somalia through the border town of Dolo, where 6,000 Ethiopian forces are based. They advanced deep into Gedo region in the direction of the towns of Beledehawa and Elwak, accompanied by militia of pro-Ethiopian, Somali fraction leaders. In Hiraan, Ethiopian forces which entered along with TFG-forces exchanged fire with al-Shabaab militants and advanced until the Kalaber junction, near Beledweyne. The Ethiopian troops then withdrew to Ferfer.\n\nOn 29 August, there was a second Ethiopian incursion. A large number of Ethiopian forces in military vehicles, accompanied by highly trained TFG forces, entered several villages in al-Shabaab controlled Hiraan region. This came at a time when al-Shabaab militants regularly ventured near the border. Hussein Abdallah, an ASWJ loyalist claimed that the movements were a preliminary action to signal that Ethiopian authorities are able of weakening the Islamist insurgents, to al-Shabaab's leadership.\n\nOn 1 September, Ethiopian forces moved deeper into Gedo region, via Dolow, entering the TFG-held village of Yeed. TFG officials in the region reported they were planning to capture the entire Bay and Bakool regions from al-Shabaab.\n\nOn 30 December, TFG forces clashed with Ethiopian troops in the Jawil district, near Beledweyne, after Ethiopian forces took a TFG soldier into custody. One TFG soldier and one civilian were injured in the clashes.\n\n3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa official Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi, complained about Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were doing this because they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability.\n\nOn 19 November, eyewitness reported large number of Ethiopian troops crossing into Somalia. Ethiopian authorities denied this.\n\nAfter a multinational conference held on 25 November in Addis Ababa, IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces' campaign against Al-Shabaab.\n\nOn 31 December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked Beledweyne in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting. They later took control of Baidoa, among other areas.\n\nOn 22 October 2012, the Spokesman of African Union Mission to Somalia (AMISOM) Col. Ali Aden Humed speaking to journalists in Mogadishu on Saturday said that Ethiopian forces present in parts of the regions of Somalia will soon pull out from the country.\nThe spokesman said AMISOM troops will take over the areas where Ethiopian forces are holding at the moment. \"The plan by AMISOM is to take over the positions held by Ethiopian forces in parts of the regions of the country, Ethiopian troops will soon retreat back to their position along Somalia border\" said Col. Ali Aden Humed.\n\nIn 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom announced that Ethiopian troops were pulling out of Baidoa as the situation on the ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting Al-Shabaab. Following the Westgate shooting in Nairobi by Al Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted its plans to withdraw completely out of Somalia. In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia. The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group. According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure. Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members. It is also believed that some Ethiopian troops in Somalia operate independently from AMISOM.\n\nIn December 2014, the Ethiopian government offered to replace the last AMISOM contingent from Sierra Leone with fresh Ethiopian military reinforcements.\n\nIn 2015, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), announced a new military operation against Al Shabaab, for removing it in the last strong holds in Somalia. The operation involved Ethiopian National Defence and Kenya Defence Forces too.\n\nAt the end of the month of July 2015, AMISOM and Somalia National Army regained many villages and major towns of Baardhere and Dinsoor.\n\nAccording to press reports, Somali and Kenyan government officials have recruited and trained Somali refugees in Kenya and Kenyan nationals who are ethnic Somalis to fight insurgents in Somalia. However, the Somali chief of military staff and spokesmen from the Kenyan government have denied this.\n\nOn 20 July 2010 border clashes between Kenya and Al-Shabaab insurgents occurred when gunmen from the militia attacked a Kenyan border patrol along the border area in Liboi, Lagdera. There was a subsequent fierce exchange of fire between the two sides leading to the deaths of 2 militia and the wounding of one Kenyan officer. Hundreds of security personnel were later deployed to the border following the clash and because of continued fighting between two militia groups in the neighbouring town of Dobley, Somalia. Al-Shabaab had previously claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing in Uganda in July.\n\nIn October 2011, the Kenya Defence Forces began Operation Linda Nchi against Al-Shabaab in southern Somalia. The mission was officially led by the Somali armed forces , with the Kenyan armed forces providing supporting role. In early June 2012, Kenyan forces were formally integrated into AMISOM.\n\n"}

The origins of the fair can be traced back to medieval times where it became one of England's dynamic trading centers. The fair has survived medieval times and is organised for a two-day duration in September each year\nby the Oxford City Council with the London and Home Counties section of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain.\n\nThe earliest reference for the fair is from The Session Rolls of James I, and the origins of the fair related to St Giles' Church at the north end of St Giles (Oxford, Oxfordshire)'. This was originally completed in 1120, but the church was not actually consecrated until 1200, by St Hugh of Lincoln, a Carthusian monk and bishop. As part of the commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established. The fair was parted between the `college' and the `city' side, with the college side tracing its rights to the fair from the Manor of Walton. \n\nThe medieval fair was held in Walton Manor, where it took place in the St Giles' churchyard on St Giles Day and during the following week. There were also various pleasant traditions, such as anyone with a beershop was allowed to bring barrels of beer to St Giles' Fair for sale. Another custom was that any householder in St Giles itself could sell beer and spirits during the fair by hanging the bough of a tree over their front door.\n\nThe fair had Queen Elizabeth I stayed in Oxford between 3–10 September 1567 and watched the fair from the windows of St John's College on the east side of St Giles'. It evolved from the St Giles' parish wake, first recorded in 1624, and which became known as St Giles' Feast. In the 1780s, it was a toy fair, with cheap items for sale. By 1800, it had become a more general fair with stalls and rides. From the 1830s, the fair included adult amusements and it became more rowdy, so much so that there were calls for it to be closed.\nBy the Victorian era, with train travel excursions becoming available, the fair was attracting people from places as far away as Birmingham and Cardiff. In 1930 Oxford's city corporation, now the Oxford City Council, took over the running of the fair. In the 1930s the poet John Betjeman described the fair as follows:\n\"It is about the biggest fair in England. The whole of St Giles' and even Magdalen Street by Elliston and Cavell's right up to and beyond the War Memorial, at the meeting of the Woodstock and Banbury roads, is thick with freak shows, roundabouts, cake-walks, the whip, and the witching waves.\"\nThe fair continues to this day, nowadays as a funfair, held on the Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday following 1 September, which is St Giles' Day. It is unusual for an English fair, being held in a major street of a city and blocking traffic for its two-day duration in September each year.\nIt is organised by the Oxford City Council with the London and Home Counties section of the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain.\n\nThe street is closed to traffic for two days each September for this traditional fair. Formerly, the University Parks were also closed at the same time to show that they are owned by the University of Oxford rather than formally being public. The fair also extends into Magdalen Street to the south and Banbury Road and Woodstock Road to the north.\n\n"}

The cartoon was nominated for the 1945 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), which it lost to the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon \"Mouse Trouble\".\n\nPorky Pig is the supervisor of the \"Flockheed Eggcraft Factory\", where dozens of hens lay eggs for the war effort (in this case, World War II). The hens suddenly get distracted from their egg laying when a handsome rooster named Frankie (who sings like Frank Sinatra) is heard singing outside. Frankie's renditions of \"It Can't Be Wrong\" by Dick Haymes and \"As Time Goes By\" (from \"Casablanca\", 1942) causes all the hens to swoon.\n\nPorky rushes to investigate. Soon, he is auditioning for a new crooner; those showing up are rooster caricatures of Nelson Eddy (\"Shortnin' Bread\"), Al Jolson (\"September in the Rain\"), Jimmy Durante (\"Lullaby of Broadway\"), Cab Calloway (\"Minnie the Moocher\", \"Blues in the Night\"), and Bing Crosby (\"When My Dream Boat Comes Home\").\n\nPorky asks the Bing Crosby rooster (who introduced himself as \"The Old Groaner\") to be the crooner, provoking a competition with Frankie. Between the two of them, the overexcited hens' egg production is increased to a level beyond what Porky can handle, including a just-hatched hen chick laying an egg many times her own size.\n\nSurveying literal hills and mountains of eggs all over his farm, Porky is impressed and asks the two roosters, \"How did you ever m-m-make 'em lay all those eggs.\" The roosters demonstrate their technique by crooning at Porky, who lays a mountainful of eggs himself as a result.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1356949", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1356949", "title": "Tertulia", "text": "Tertulia\n\nA tertulia (; ; ; ) is a social gathering with literary or artistic overtones, especially in Iberia or in Latin America. Tertulia also means an informal meeting of people to talk about current affairs, arts, etc. The word is originally Spanish (borrowed by Catalan and Portuguese), but it has only moderate currency in English, used mainly in describing Latin cultural contexts.\n\nA tertulia is rather similar to a salon, but a typical tertulia in recent centuries has been a regularly scheduled event in a public place such as a bar, although some tertulias are held in more private spaces, such as someone's living room. Participants, known as \"contertulios\", may share their recent creations such as poetry, short stories, other writings, and even artwork or songs. Usually, but not always, the participants in a regularly scheduled tertulia are in some respects like-minded, with similar political or literary tastes.\n\nPhilip II of Spain, in the 16th century, was very interested in the ancient world and its cultures. Within his court, he employed polymaths such as Juan de Mal Lara to compose poetry to accompany artworks which enriched his various palaces. Of great interest to the king were the works of the Christian author Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus. Courtiers and academics would gather to discuss such works with their royal patron, and so \"tertulia\" emerged as a term for learned discussion.\n\nAt \"tertulias\" before 1810 in at the houses of Buenos Aires society women such as Mercedes de Lasalde Riglos, Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson and Flora Azcuénaga the discussions led up to the May Revolution, the first stage in the struggle for Argentine independence from Spain.\n\"Madame Riglos\" could be seen as the chief lady of the Tory (conservative) faction in Buenos Aires.\nShe was sparkling and familiar, although highly aristocratic.\nDoña Melchora de Sarratea, queen of fashion and of the Buenos Aires salons, was so well aware of public and private affairs that she was held to be an enthusiastic supporter of Whig (liberal) principles.\nMariquita Sánchez de Thompson's forte was foreign relations.\nSimilar \"tertulias\" were being held during this period in Lima, Peru, by women such as Manuela Rábago de Avellafuertes de Riglos and Narcisa Arias de Saavaedra.\n\nHe wrote that it was a widespread custom among the more notable and well-to-do families, and also with many decent families, to give \"tertulias\" at least once a week.\nUsually the guests danced only from 8:00 to 12:00 at night, in which case only mate was served, but if it went on later chocolate would be added.\nDress was not elaborate, and dancing, music and conversation were the only entertainment, so the cost was low.\nA piano player might be hired, or the young people might play dance pieces, or some old and complacent aunt might play some contradanza.\nEven if it was old, the thing was to dance.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "33493008", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33493008", "title": "Thunderbirds (TV series)", "text": "Thunderbirds (TV series)\n\nThunderbirds is a British science-fiction television series created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, filmed by their production company AP Films (APF) and distributed by ITC Entertainment. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic marionette puppetry (dubbed \"Supermarionation\") combined with scale model special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of thirty-two 50-minute episodes; production ceased following the completion of the second series' sixth episode when Lew Grade, the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television.\n\nSet in the mid-2060s, \"Thunderbirds\" is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions \"Four Feather Falls\", \"Supercar\", \"Fireball XL5\" and \"Stingray\". It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the \"Thunderbirds\" and launched from IR's secret base in the Pacific Ocean. The main characters are ex-astronaut Jeff Tracy, the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the \"Thunderbird\" machines.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" began its first run in the United Kingdom on the ITV network in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries. Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring various merchandising campaigns, the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels (\"Thunderbirds Are Go\" and \"Thunderbird 6\", released in 1966 and 1968 respectively), a 2004 live-action film adaptation and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", premiered in 2015, in honour of the original show's 50th anniversary.\n\nWidely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series, \"Thunderbirds\" has received particular praise for its effects (directed by Derek Meddings) and musical score (composed by Barry Gray). It is also well remembered for its title sequence, which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor Peter Dyneley (who voiced the character of Jeff): \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1: \"Thunderbirds\" Are Go!\" A real-life rescue service, the International Rescue Corps, is named after the organisation featured in the series.\n\nSet between 2065 and 2067, \"Thunderbirds\" follows the exploits of the Tracy family, headed by American ex-astronaut turned multi-millionaire philanthropist Jeff Tracy. He is a widower with five adult sons: Scott, John, Virgil, Gordon and Alan. The Tracys form International Rescue (IR), a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life. They are aided in this mission by technologically advanced land, sea, air and space vehicles, which are called into service when conventional rescue techniques prove ineffective. The most important of these are five machines named the \"Thunderbirds\", each assigned to one of the five Tracy brothers:\n\n\nWith the engineer Brains and Jeff's elderly mother, as well as the Malaysian manservant Kyrano and his daughter Tin-Tin (who serves as Brains' assistant), the family reside in a luxurious villa on Tracy Island, their hidden base in the South Pacific Ocean. In this location, IR is safe from criminals and spies who envy the organisation's technology and seek to acquire the secrets of its machines.\n\nDespite its humanitarian principles, some of IR's operations are necessitated not by misadventure but deliberate sabotage motivated by greed for power and wealth. For missions that require criminal investigation, the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by English aristocrat Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward and her butler Aloysius Parker. Based at Creighton-Ward Mansion in Kent, Penelope and Parker's primary mode of transport is FAB 1, a specially-modified Rolls-Royce. The most persistent of IR's adversaries is the criminal known only as the \"Hood\". Operating from a temple in the Malaysian jungle, and possessing abilities of hypnosis and dark magic, he exerts a powerful telepathic control over Kyrano, his estranged half-brother, and manipulates the Tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs. This allows him to spy on the \"Thunderbird\" machines and, by selling their secrets, make himself rich.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" was the fourth Supermarionation puppet TV series to be produced by APF, which was founded by the husband-and-wife duo of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (née Thamm) with their business partners Arthur Provis, Reg Hill, and John Read. Pitched in late 1963, the series was commissioned by Lew Grade of ITC, APF's parent company, on the back of the positive audience response to \"Stingray.\"\n\nGerry Anderson drew inspiration for the series' underlying concept from the West German mining disaster known as the \"Wunder von Lengede\" (\"Miracle of Lengede\"). In October 1963, the collapse of a nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of Lengede, killing 29 miners and trapping 21 others underground. Lacking the means to drill an escape shaft, the authorities were forced to requisition a heavy-duty bore from Bremen; despite the considerable time necessary to transport the bore by rail significantly reducing the chances of a successful rescue, 11 of the trapped miners were eventually saved. Recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response, Anderson conceived the idea of an \"international rescue\" organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances.\n\nSeeking to distinguish his 26-episode proposal from APF's earlier productions, Anderson attempted to pitch stories at a level that would appeal to both adults and children. Whereas previous series had been shown during the late afternoon, Anderson wanted \"Thunderbirds\" to be broadcast in a family-friendly primetime slot. Sylvia remembers that \"our market had grown and a 'kidult' show ... was the next step.\" The Andersons retired to their holiday villa in Portugal to expand the premise, script the pilot episode and compose a scriptwriters' guide. According to Sylvia, the writing process depended on a \"division of labour\", whereby Gerry created the action sequences while she managed characterisation. The decision to make a father and his sons the main characters was influenced by the premise of \"Bonanza\", as well as Sylvia's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series' appeal. The Tracy brothers were named after Mercury Seven astronauts: Scott Carpenter, John Glenn, Virgil \"Gus\" Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Alan Shepard.\n\nThe series' title was derived from a letter written by Gerry's brother, Lionel, while he had been serving overseas as an RAF flight sergeant during World War II. While stationed in Arizona, Lionel had made reference to Thunderbird Field, a nearby United States Army Air Forces base. Drawn to the \"punchiness\" of \"\"Thunderbirds\", Anderson dropped his working title of \"International Rescue\"\" and renamed both the series and IR's rescue vehicles, which had previously been designated \"Rescues 1\" to \"5\". His inspiration for the launch sequences of \"Thunderbirds 1\", \"2\" and \"3\" originated from contemporary United States Air Force launch procedure: Anderson had learnt how the Strategic Air Command would keep its pilots on permanent standby, seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take-off at a moment's notice.\n\nIn the DVD documentary \"The Thunderbirds Companion\", Anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused \"Thunderbirds\" to be made \"as an American show\". During the character development and voice casting process, the Andersons' main priority was to ensure that the series had transatlantic appeal, thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer. Scripts were typed in American English and printed on US-style quarto-size paper.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" was filmed at APF's studios on the Slough Trading Estate between 1964 and 1966. In preparation, the number of full-time crew was expanded to 100. Shooting began in September 1964 after five months of pre-production. Due to the new series' technical complexity, this was a period longer than for any of APF's earlier productions. To speed up the filming, episodes were shot in pairs, at a rate of one per month, on separate soundstages and by separate crews (designated \"A\" and \"B\"). By 1964, APF was the UK's largest commercial user of colour film, consuming more than three million feet (570 miles or 910 kilometres) of stock per year.\n\nAlan Pattillo, a longtime scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official script editor in late 1964. This move was aimed to reduce the burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself. Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and David Elliott alternated with the less-experienced Desmond Saunders and newcomer David Lane for each month's filming. Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage. In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that \"Thunderbirds\" contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series. He explained that rapid editing was necessary on account of the characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest for more than a few seconds per shot.\n\nAfter viewing the completed 25-minute pilot, \"Trapped in the Sky\", Lew Grade was so impressed by APF's work that he instructed Anderson to double the episode length and increased the series' budget per episode from £25,000 to £38,000. As a result, \"Thunderbirds\" became not only the company's longest and highest-budgeted production, but also among the most expensive TV series to have been made up to that point. The crew, who had been filming at a rate of two 25-minute episodes per fortnight, faced significant challenges during the transition to the new format: eight episodes had already been completed, scripts for up to ten more had been written, and substantial rewrites would be necessary to satisfy the longer running time. Anderson lamented: \"Our time-scale was far too drawn out. ITC's New York office insisted that they should have one show a fortnight ... Everything had to move at twice the speed.\" APF spent over seven months extending the existing episodes.\n\nTony Barwick, who had impressed Pattillo and the Andersons with an unsubmitted script that he had written for \"Danger Man\", was recruited to assist in the writing of subplots and filler material. He found that the longer format created opportunities to strengthen the characterisation. Science-fiction writer John Peel suggests that \"small character touches\" make the puppet cast of \"Thunderbirds\" \"much more rounded\" than those of earlier APF series. He compares the writing favourably to that of live-action drama. The new footage proved useful during the development of the first series finale, \"Security Hazard\": since the previous two episodes (\"Attack of the Alligators!\" and \"The Cham-Cham\") had overspent their budgets, Pattillo devised a flashback-dominated clip show containing only 17 minutes of new material to reduce costs.\n\nFilming of Series One was completed in December 1965. A second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in March 1966. Barwick became a full-time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing Pattillo. The main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt; in addition, the art department expanded some of the standing sets, including the Tracy Villa lounge and the \"Thunderbird 5\" control room. To accommodate the simultaneous filming of the TV series and \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", APF purchased two more buildings on the Slough Trading Estate and converted them into new stages. As crew and studio space were divided between the two productions, filming of the TV series progressed at half the previous speed, as APF's B crew produced one episode per month. Filming on \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" was completed by June, allowing A crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode, \"Ricochet\".\n\nProduction of \"Thunderbirds\" ended in August 1966 with the completion of the sixth episode of Series Two. In February that year, it had been reported that Grade had been unable to sell the series in the United States due to disagreements over timeslots. In July, he cancelled \"Thunderbirds\" after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer. The three major US networks of the time – NBC, CBS and ABC – had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price. When NBC withdrew its offer, the other two immediately followed.\n\nBy the time of its cancellation, \"Thunderbirds\" had become widely popular in the UK and was being distributed extensively overseas. Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs. He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market. This became \"Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons\".\n\nVoice-recording sessions were supervised by Pattillo and the Andersons, with Sylvia Anderson in charge of casting. Dialogue was recorded once per month at a rate of two scripts per session. Supporting parts were not pre-assigned, but negotiated by the cast among themselves. Two recordings would be made at each session: one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming, the other to be added to the soundtrack during post-production. The tapes were edited at Gate Recording Theatre in Birmingham.\n\nIn the interest of transatlantic appeal, it was decided that the main characters would be mostly American and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used. British, Canadian and Australian actors formed most of the voice cast; the only American involved was stage actor David Holliday, who was noticed in London's West End and given the part of Virgil Tracy. Following the completion of the first series, Holliday returned to the US. The character was voiced by English-Canadian actor Jeremy Wilkin for \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", Series Two and \"Thunderbird 6\".\n\nBritish actor David Graham was among the first to be cast. He had previously voiced characters in \"Four Feather Falls\", \"Supercar\", \"Fireball XL5\" and \"Stingray\". Beyond the APF productions, he had supplied one of the original Dalek voices on \"Doctor Who\". Cast alongside Graham was Australian actor Ray Barrett. Like Graham, he had worked for the Andersons before, having voiced Titan and Commander Shore in \"Stingray\". A veteran of radio drama, Barrett was skilled at performing a range of voices and accents in quick succession. Villains of the week would typically be voiced by either Barrett or Graham. Aware of the sensitive political climate of the Cold War and not wishing to \"perpetuate the idea that Russia was the enemy with a whole generation of children watching\", Gerry Anderson decided the Hood (voiced by Barrett) should be Oriental and placed his temple hideout in Malaysia to defy the viewer's expectations.\n\nAlthough Lady Penelope and Parker (the latter voiced by Graham) were among the first characters developed, neither was conceived as a major role. Parker's Cockney manner was based on a waiter at a pub in Cookham that was sometimes visited by the crew. On Gerry Anderson's recommendation, Graham dined there regularly to study the accent. Anderson's first choice for the role of Penelope had been Fenella Fielding, but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself. Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and Joan Greenwood. On Penelope and Parker's secondary role as comic relief, Gerry explained, \"We British can laugh at ourselves, so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team. And in America they love the British aristocracy too.'\"\n\nAs well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the recurring character of Commander Norman, chief of air traffic control at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen. Shane Rimmer, the voice of Scott, was cast on the strength of his performance on the BBC soap opera \"Compact\". Meanwhile, fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process. The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: \"They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother. David, who [was] a bit older than I am, told them that he had this friend, me, who would be great.\"\n\nChristine Finn, known for her role in the TV serial \"Quatermass and the Pit\", provided the voices of Tin-Tin Kyrano and Grandma Tracy. With Sylvia Anderson, she was also responsible for voicing most of the female and child supporting characters. Supporting parts were occasionally voiced by John Tate (the father of \"\" actor Nick Tate), Paul Maxwell and Charles Tingwell; the latter two joined the cast in Series Two following their contributions to \"Thunderbirds Are Go\". None of these three actors were credited for their performances.\n\nThe puppet stages used for the filming of \"Thunderbirds\" were only one-fifth the size of those used for a standard live-action production, typically measuring in length, width and height. Bob Bell, assisted by Keith Wilson and Grenville Nott, headed the art department for Series One. During the simultaneous filming of Series Two and \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" in 1966, Bell attended mainly to the film, entrusting set design for the TV series to Wilson.\n\nSince it was necessary for the art department's interior sets to conform to the effects department's exterior plans, each team closely monitored the other's work. According to Sylvia Anderson, Bell's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department's push for \"more extravagant\" design. This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets: Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands. He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem: \"As soon as we positioned [the puppets] standing alongside [the model], they looked ridiculous, as the car towered over them.\" He ultimately adopted a \"mix-and-match\" approach, in which smaller items, such as tableware, were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies.\n\nWhile designing the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell and his staff strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting in the shape of a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.\n\nThe head puppet sculptor was Christine Glanville, who also served as the lead puppeteer. Glanville's four-person team built the 13 members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between £250 and £300 per puppet (approximately £ and £ in ). Since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages, the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate. Facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads: as well as a head with a neutral expression, each main character was given a \"smiler\", a \"frowner\" and a \"blinker\". The finished puppets were approximately tall, or adult human height.\n\nThe puppets were made up of more than 30 individual components, the most important of which was the solenoid that synchronised lip movements with the characters' pre-recorded dialogue. This device was positioned inside the head unit; consequently, torsos and limbs appeared relatively small. The puppets' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown, who preferred the \"Thunderbirds\" marionettes over the accurately-proportioned ones that first appeared in \"Captain Scarlet\": \"The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them ... Even some of the more normal-looking faces, such as Scott and Jeff, for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards.\" Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets' still being \"very much caricatures\", since it made them \"more lovable and appealing ... There was a naive quality about them and nothing too complex.\"\n\nThe appearances of the main characters were inspired by those of actors and other entertainers, who were typically selected from the show business directory \"Spotlight\". According to Glanville, as part of a trend away from the strong caricature of previous series, APF was seeking \"more natural faces\" for the puppets. The face of Jeff Tracy was based on that of Lorne Greene, Scott on Sean Connery, Alan on Robert Reed, John on Adam Faith and Charlton Heston, Brains on Anthony Perkins and Parker on Ben Warriss. Sylvia Anderson brought the character of Penelope to life in likeness as well as voice: after her test moulds were rejected, sculptor Mary Turner decided to use Anderson herself as a template.\n\nMain character heads were initially sculpted in either Plasticine or clay. Once the general aspect had been finalised, this served as the template for a silicone rubber mould. This was coated with Bondaglass (fibreglass mixed with resin) and enhanced with Bondapaste, a putty-like substance, to accentuate contours. The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid, leather mouth parts and plastic eyes, as well as incisor teeth – a first for a Supermarionation production. Puppets known as \"revamps\", which had plastic heads, portrayed the supporting characters. These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes; their faces were remoulded from one episode to the next. Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and, as their numbers increased, photographed to compile an internal casting directory.\n\nWigs were made of mohair or, in the case of the Penelope puppet, human hair. Puppet bodies were built in three sizes: \"large male\" (specifically for the Tracys and the Hood), \"small male\" and \"small female\". Sylvia Anderson, the head costume designer, devised the main characters' attire. To give the puppets increased mobility, the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials, instead working with cotton, silk and wool. Between 1964 and 1966, the department's stock numbered more than 700 costumes.\n\nEach puppet's head was fitted with about 10 thin tungsten steel wires. During the filming, dialogue was played into the studio using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses. Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process. The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility, were made even less noticeable through the application of powder paint that matched the background colours of the set. Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: \"[The puppeteers] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [paint] here, anti-flare there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'\" Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements with the help of a viewfinder-powered CCTV feedback system. As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor using rods.\n\nDue to their low weight and the fact that they had only one control wire per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes involving movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a \"bobbing\" action to simulate motion. Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with \"New Scientist\", director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets \"appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed).\" Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.\nThe effects for all the APF series from \"Supercar\" to \"UFO\" were directed by Derek Meddings, who later worked on the \"James Bond\" and \"Superman\" films. Knowing that \"Thunderbirds\" would be the \"biggest project [APF] had worked on\", Meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for \"Stingray\". He therefore established a second unit under technician Brian Johncock, and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences. This expansion increased the number of APF crews and stages to five each. A typical episode contained around 100 effects shots; Meddings' team completed up to 18 per day.\n\nAn addition to the effects department was Mike Trim, who served as Meddings' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings. Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an \"organic\" design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children's toys. Models and sets were also \"dirtied down\" with powder paint or pencil lead to create a used look. Toy cars and vans were used in long shot, while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and suspension for added realism. Miniature fans and Jetex pellets, which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust, were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails. Another of Meddings' inventions was a closed, cyclical effects stage nicknamed the \"rolling road\": consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds, this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space. Airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a \"rolling sky\", with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds.\n\nOne of Meddings' first tasks was to shoot stock footage of the \"Thunderbird\" machines and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion. The finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately. The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the Stourhead Estate in Wiltshire. In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as associate producer, Meddings was further tasked with designing the \"Thunderbird\" fleet and FAB 1. Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex. Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the \"Thunderbird\" machines were created for the series.\n\nDuring the designing and filming process, Meddings' first priorities were realism and credibility. With the exception of \"Thunderbird 5\", each vehicle was built in three or four scales. Meddings' swing-wing concept for \"Thunderbird 1\" was inspired by his wish to create something \"more dynamic\" than a fixed-wing aircraft. He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of \"Thunderbird 2\" until he inverted the wings, later commenting, \"... at the time, all aircraft had swept-back wings. I only did it to be different.\" This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings' part. He described the \"Thunderbird 2\" launch as \"probably the most memorable\" sequence that his team devised for an APF production.\n\nThe largest model of \"Thunderbird 3\", whose design was loosely based on the Soviet \"Soyuz\" rocket, was tall. \"Thunderbird 4\" was particularly difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective. \"Thunderbird 5\", the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, was based on the Tracy Island Round House. Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed. Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from balsa wood, Jelutong wood or fibreglass. To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.\n\nAs the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker needed to fit inside, the largest of all the models was the seven-foot FAB 1, which cost £2,500 (approximately £ in ) to build. The Rolls-Royce's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson. Rolls-Royce Ltd. supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic radiator grille for close-up shots of the front of the car. In exchange for its cooperation, the company requested that a Spirit of Ecstasy be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as \"Rolls\".\n\nScale explosions were created using substances such as fuller's earth, petrol gel, magnesium strips and Cordtex explosive. They were originally filmed at up to 120 frames per second (f.p.s.), so that when slowed down to the regular 24 f.p.s., their apparent magnitude and length would be increased. Gunpowder canisters were ignited to create rocket jets. The wires that electronically fired the rockets also allowed a member of the crew, holding a cruciform and positioned on an overhead gantry, to \"fly\" the model over the set. By far the most unwieldy model was \"Thunderbird 2\", which Meddings remembered as being \"awful\" to fly. A combination of unreliable rockets and weak wiring frequently caused problems: should the former be slow to ignite, the current quickly caused the latter to overheat and snap, potentially damaging the model and even setting fire to the set. Conditions above the studio floor were often dangerous due to the heat and smoke. Although many of the exhaust sound effects used in the series were drawn from an audio library, some were specially recorded during a Red Arrows display at RAF Little Rissington in Gloucestershire.\n\nBy 1966, Meddings' commitments were split between Series Two and \"Thunderbirds Are Go\". While Meddings worked on the film, camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects. By this stage, the basic frame of \"Thunderbird 2\" had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch. Meddings was displeased with the result, reflecting that the replacement was \"not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape ... I never felt our model-makers managed to recapture the look of the original.\"\n\nCritic David Garland suggests that the challenge facing the \"Thunderbirds\" effects department was to strike a balance between the \"conventional science-fiction imperative of the 'futuristic'\" and the \"seeping hyper-realist concerns mandated by the Andersons' approach to the puppets\". \"Thunderbirds\" has been praised for the quality of its effects. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, writers of \"Collins Telly Guide\", consider the model work \"uniformly impressive\". To Paul Cornell, Martin Day and Keith Topping, writers of \"The Guinness Book of Classic British TV\", the effects are \"way beyond anything seen on TV previously\". Impressed by their work on \"Thunderbirds\", film director Stanley Kubrick hired several members of Meddings' staff to supervise the effects shooting for \"\".\n\nThe series' title sequence, storyboarded by Gerry Anderson, is made up of two parts. It opens with a countdown of \"5, 4, 3, 2, 1: \"Thunderbirds\" Are Go!\", provided by Dyneley in character as Jeff Tracy. In a departure from the style of \"Stingray\", the \"Thunderbirds\" title sequence varies with each episode: the first part consists of an action montage that serves as a preview of the plot. Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, biographers of Gerry Anderson, compare this device favourably to a film trailer.\n\nThe second part, accompanied by composer Barry Gray's \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\", features portraits of the main puppet cast superimposed on various vehicles and settings. Peel describes this as \"ostensibly a return to the 'series stars' concept long known in TV\", while Garland considers such imagery demonstrative of Anderson's commitment to \"incremental realism\" through a convergence of human and puppet characteristics. Essayist Jonathan Bignell suggests that the use of portraits conveys Anderson's partiality to \"visual revelation of machines and physical action\".\n\nAccording to Daniel O'Brien, writer of \"SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World\", the \"Thunderbirds\" title sequence encapsulates the reasons for the series' enduring popularity. Dyneley's countdown is particularly well remembered and has been widely quoted. Dean Newman of the Syfy channel website ranks \"Thunderbirds\" eighth in a list of \"Top 10 TV title sequences\", while Den of Geek's Martin Anderson considers the sequence the best of any TV series.\n\nThe score was composed by Gray, who served as musical director for all of the Anderson productions up to the first series of \"\". In response to Gerry Anderson's request that the main theme have a \"military feel\", Gray produced a brass-dominated piece titled \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\", which was recorded in December 1964 at Olympic Studios in London. The end titles were originally to have been accompanied by \"Flying High\", a lyrical track sung by Gary Miller with backing by Ken Barrie. Ultimately, a variation of the march was used instead. Incidental music was recorded over nine months between March and December 1965. As most of the music budget was spent on the series' earlier episodes, later instalments drew heavily on APF's ever-expanding music library.\n\nPeel considers \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\" to be \"one of the best TV themes ever written – perfect for the show and catchy when heard alone\". Morag Reavley of BBC Online argues that the piece is \"up there ... in the quintessential soundtrack of the Sixties\" with the \"James Bond\" films and the songs of Frank Sinatra, Elvis and The Beatles. More generally, he praises the series' \"catchy, pulse-quickening tunes\", as well as Gray's aptitude for \"musical nuance\" and the mixing of genres. Heather Phares of Allmusic considers \"Thunderbirds Are Go!\" – the track accompanying the launch sequences of \"Thunderbirds 1\", \"2\" and \"3\" – to be a reflection of the mod aspect of 1960s British spy fiction. She also highlights Gray's homage to – and divergence from – musical norms, commenting that his score \"sends up the spy and action/adventure conventions of the '60s very stylishly and subtly\".\n\nDavid Huckvale identifies Wagnerian homage in both the theme music and the series' premise. Noting that the theme's opening string ostinato is similar in effect to a recurring motif in \"Ride of the Valkyries\", he also likens the \"Thunderbird\" machines to Valkyries themselves: \"Their function is more benevolent than those warrior maidens, but they \"do\" hover over danger, death and destruction.\" Kevin J. Donnelly of the University of Southampton acknowledges the series' \"big-sounding orchestral score\", which he compares to that of a live-action film. He also suggests that the music serves partly to draw attention away from the physical imperfections of the puppets.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" premiered on British television on 30 September 1965 on the ITV franchises ATV Midlands, Westward and Channel. Other broadcasters, including ATV London and Granada, started transmissions the following month. The Christmas-themed series finale, \"Give or Take a Million\", was first broadcast on 25 December 1966. Despite Grade's decision to extend the running time, the series was also sold in a 25-minute format that effectively doubled the number of episodes; this was the version used by Granada for their original broadcasts. In this area, two instalments aired on the same night, separated by the ITN Evening News, and the conclusion would begin with a narration by Shane Rimmer summarising the previous episode's action. In the Midlands, ATV broadcast the complete hour-long versions in a 7.00pm slot for the first 26 episodes. The second series, together with repeats of series one, was shown in the two-part format on consecutive evenings in a 5.25pm slot. \n\nGranada transmitted \"Thunderbirds\" in its original, 50-minute format for the first time with the start of repeats in 1966. In 1968, the franchise briefly aired episodes in three parts due to timeslot restrictions. The availability of repeats during the 1960s and 1970s varied among regions. ATV Midlands screened the series regularly into the early 1970s; by contrast, \"Thunderbirds\" was entirely absent from Yorkshire Television between 1968 and 1976. The series was last transmitted on the ITV franchises in 1981.\n\nIn 1990, 8 of the 19 audio episodes released by APF Records were converted into radio dramas, which were transmitted on BBC Radio 5. The success of the radio series encouraged the BBC to acquire the rights to the TV episodes, which it broadcast simultaneously in all regions from September 1991 on BBC2.\n\nSince the end of the first network run, which achieved average viewing figures of more than six million, the BBC has repeated the series six times: between 1992 and 1993 (Series One only), 1994 and 1995 (nine episodes only), and 2000 and 2001 (in remastered form), as well as in 2003, 2005 and 2006. Other channels that have shown repeats include UK Gold (1994–95), Bravo (1996–97), Cartoon Network (2001–02), Boomerang (2001–03) and Syfy (2009). In Scotland, the BBC screened a Gaelic dub, \"Tairnearan Tar As\" (\"Thunderbirds Are Go\") in the early 1990s.\n\nBefore its UK debut, \"Thunderbirds\" was distributed to 30 other countries including the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. Pre-sales revenue totalled £350,000 (approximately £ million today). In the year following the series' first appearance, the number of countries increased to 66. In Japan, where it was first broadcast by NHK, \"Thunderbirds\" attracted a sizeable fan following and influenced series such as \"Ultraman\", \"Mighty Jack\", \"Himitsu Sentai Gorenger\", \"Super Rescue Solbrain\" and \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\". In the US, the 25-minute format entered first-run syndication, to modest success, in 1968. Other overseas broadcasters have included TechTV and Family Room HD (US), BBC Kids and YTV (Canada), Nine Network and Foxtel (Australia), TVNZ (in the 1980s) and later TV3 (New Zealand), MediaCorp TV12 Kids Central (Singapore) and RTÉ Two (Republic of Ireland).\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" is generally considered the Andersons' most popular series and their greatest critical and commercial success. In 1966, the show received a Royal Television Society Silver Medal for Outstanding Artistic Achievement and Gerry Anderson received an honorary fellowship of the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society. In 2007, \"Thunderbirds\" achieved 19th place in a \"Radio Times\" magazine reader poll to determine the best science-fiction TV programme of all time. It is ranked fourth by the 2013 Channel 5 list show \"50 Greatest Kids' TV Shows\".\n\nFor Peel, \"Thunderbirds\" is \"without a doubt the peak of the Supermarionation achievement\". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a \"more adult\" level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, effective humour and \"gripping and convincing\" episodes ensured that \"everyone in the audience found something to love about it.\" Simon Heffer, a fan of \"Thunderbirds\" in childhood, commented positively on the series for \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2011: \"All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in \"Thunderbirds\": dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, at a time when the whole of Britain was in a cultural cringe to them; and, of course, glamorous locations ... Then, of course, there was the nail-biting tension of the rescues themselves ...\" Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a \"television perennial\".\n\nIn his foreword to John Marriott's book, \"Thunderbirds Are Go!\", Anderson put forward several explanations for the series' enduring popularity: it \"contains elements that appeal to most children – danger, jeopardy and destruction. But because International Rescue's mission is to save life, there is no gratuitous violence.\" According to Anderson, \"Thunderbirds\" incorporates a \"strong family atmosphere, where Dad reigns supreme\". Both O'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series' positive \"family values\". In addition, Heffer and others have written of its cross-generational appeal. In 2000, shortly before the series' BBC revival, Brian Viner remarked in \"Radio Times\" that \"Thunderbirds\" was on the point of \"captivating yet another generation of viewers\". Stuart Hood, writing for \"The Spectator\" in 1965, praised \"Thunderbirds\" as a \"modern fairy tale\"; adding that it \"can sometimes be frightening\", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents. Writing for \"Dreamwatch\" in 1994, Andrew Thomas described \"Thunderbirds\" as only \"nominally\" a children's programme: \"Its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult.\"\n\nJeff Evans, author of \"The Penguin TV Companion\", argues that the series' 50-minute format allows for stronger character development and \"tension-building\". O'Brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing, asserting that the plots are often \"formulaic\" and are sometimes \"stretched to snapping point\" by the extended running time. Cornell, Day and Topping are critical: they consider the writing at times \"woefully poor\" and argue that \"Thunderbirds\" as a whole is \"often as clichéd as previous Anderson series\". Peel, despite praising the storylines and characterisation, suggests that the \"tongue-in-cheek\" humour of \"Stingray\" is less evident. Where \"Thunderbirds\" improves on its predecessor, Peel believes, is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices, child and animal characters, comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the \"standard Anderson sexism\": female characters, marginalised in earlier series, are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles.\n\nNoting the attention to detail of the series' launch sequences, Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the \"Thunderbird\" craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast. The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull, who comments that of all the Andersons' series, \"Thunderbirds\" is the most evocative of a recurring theme: the \"necessity of the human component of the machine\", whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by \"brave human beings and technology working together\". This makes the series' vision of the 2060s \"wonderfully humanistic and reassuring\". O'Brien similarly praises this optimism, comparing the Tracy family to guardian Übermensch. Writing for \"Wired UK\" magazine, Warren Ellis asserts that the series' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of \"mad and frightening engineers\", adding that \"Thunderbirds\" \"trades in vast, demented concepts ... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems.\"\n\nThomas argues that the world of \"Thunderbirds\" is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths. According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series' lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines. Newman, for his part, suggests that \"the point isn't realism. The 21st century of \"Thunderbirds\" is detailed ... but also de-populated, a high-tech toyland\". He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the \"square, almost 50s\" attitudes to race, gender and class. With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he \"would be happier if [villains] didn't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation\". Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of \"positive non-white characters\" such as Kyrano and Tin-Tin. However, he deems many of the one-off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as \"corrupt businessmen, spivs and gangsters familiar from crime films\".\n\nVarious commentators – including Bignell, Cull and O'Brien – have also discussed \"Thunderbirds\" as a product of the Cold War era. Bignell comments that the Hood's Oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with \"James Bond\" villains and fears of China operating as \"a 'third force' antagonistic to the West\". Cull observes that, despite the series' focus on the dangers of nuclear technology, the \"Thunderbird\" machines contradict this particular theme: in their case, \"an image of technology associated with the threat of Cold War mass destruction – the rocket emerging from the hidden silo – was appropriated and deployed to \"save\" life rather than to take it.\" He argues that the series adheres more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the \"Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown\", noting Lady Penelope's role as a spy in addition to two episodes (\"30 Minutes After Noon\" and \"The Man from MI.5\") that are heavily influenced by the \"James Bond\" novels and film adaptations.\n\nDuring a 2001 exhibition dedicated to the series, Masaaki Hirakata, curator at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, likened \"Thunderbirds\" to \"a modern sci-fi expression of bunraku, which probably explains why it was accepted so readily [in Japan]\".\n\nThe series' presentation of smoking was the subject of a study published in the medical journal \"Tobacco Control\" in 2002. Despite identifying examples in 26 episodes, Kate Hunt of the University of Glasgow concluded that \"Thunderbirds\" does not actively promote smoking – a view opposed by the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation (RCLCF) at the time of the series' relaunch on BBC 2. Rejecting the RCLCF's proposal that the remastered episodes be edited to digitally erase all visible cigarettes and cigars, the BBC stated that the series \"does not glorify or encourage smoking\" and described the activity as \"incidental to the plot\".\n\nMore than 3,000 \"Thunderbirds\"-themed products have been marketed since the series' debut. To accommodate the high demand for tie-ins, APF established three dedicated subsidiaries: AP Films Merchandising, AP Films Music and AP Films Toys. Some British commentators dubbed the 1966 end-of-year shopping season \"\"Thunderbirds\" Christmas\" due to the series' popularity. In the early 1990s, Matchbox launched a new toy range to coincide with the BBC 2 repeats. Sales figures for Christmas 1992 exceeded those achieved by the \"Star Wars\" merchandising campaigns of the 1970s and 1980s. Demand for Matchbox's Tracy Island Playset overwhelmed supply, resulting in shop fights and a substantial black market for the toy.\n\nA comic strip featuring the characters of Lady Penelope and Parker debuted in the early issues of APF Publishing's children's title \"TV Century 21\" in 1965. A full-length \"Thunderbirds\" strip appeared a year later, at which point the Lady Penelope adventures were given their own comic. \"Thunderbirds\", \"Lady Penelope\" and \"Captain Scarlet and Thunderbirds\" annuals were published in the late 1960s; during the same period, eight original novels were written. In 2008, FTL Publications of Minnesota launched a new series of tie-in novels.\n\nBetween 1965 and 1967, APF Records released 19 audio episodes in the form of vinyl EPs. Three are original stories; the rest are adapted from TV episode soundtracks, with additional narration provided by a member of the voice cast. The series' first video game tie-in, developed for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum computers, was released by Firebird Software in 1985. Other titles have since been released for the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance and PlayStation 2. During the late 1980s, the series was issued on home video for the first time by PolyGram and its subsidiary Channel 5. Following its acquisition by Carlton International Media in 1999, \"Thunderbirds\" was digitally remastered for the release of the first DVD versions in 2000. Blu-ray Disc editions followed in 2008.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" has been followed by two film sequels, a live-action film adaptation, two animated TV remakes and several re-edited presentations for TV broadcast and home video. The second of the remakes, \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", premiered on ITV in 2015, the 50th anniversary year of the original.\n\nThe feature-length film sequels \"Thunderbirds Are Go\" and \"Thunderbird 6\" were released in 1966 and 1968. The first was greenlit by Lew Grade before the TV series had started its broadcast run. Written and produced by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, both films were distributed by United Artists. Neither was a critical or commercial success, and Century 21 Cinema's plans for further sequels were abandoned.\n\nIn the early 1980s, episodes of \"Thunderbirds\" and other Supermarionation series were re-edited by ITC's New York offices to create a series of compilation films. Branded \"Super Space Theater\", this format was mostly intended for family viewing on American cable and syndicated TV. Three \"Thunderbirds\" features were produced: \"Thunderbirds to the Rescue\", \"Thunderbirds in Outer Space\" and \"Countdown to Disaster\".\n\nPlans for a live-action film adaptation were first announced in 1993. These eventually culminated in the 2004 film \"Thunderbirds\", directed by Jonathan Frakes and produced by StudioCanal and Working Title Films. It was a critical and commercial failure and was poorly received by fans of the TV series.\n\nThe Andersons sold their intellectual and profit participation rights to \"Thunderbirds\" and their other productions in the 1970s. As a result, they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works. \"Thunderbirds\" was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as \"Thunderbirds 2086\". In this anime re-imagining, set 20 years after the original, the vastly expanded IR is based within an arcology and operates 17 \"Thunderbird\" machines. It was inspired by \"Thunderhawks\", an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served as the basis for Anderson's Supermacromation series \"Terrahawks\".\n\nTwo re-edited series, based on condensed versions of 13 of the original episodes, aired in the US in 1994. The first, \"Thunderbirds USA\", was broadcast as part of the Fox Kids programming block; the second, \"Turbocharged Thunderbirds\", was syndicated by UPN. Developed as a comedy, \"Turbocharged Thunderbirds\" moved the action to the planet \"Thunder-World\" and combined the original puppet footage with new live-action scenes featuring a pair of human teenagers.\n\nAs well as \"Thunderhawks\", Anderson developed other ideas for a remake. A 1976 concept, \"Inter-Galactic Rescue 4\", was to have featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it. This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, \"T-Force\", which at first could not be pursued owing to a lack of funding. Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled \"GFI\", using cel animation. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.\n\nIn 2005, Anderson re-affirmed his wish to remake \"Thunderbirds\" but stated that he had been unable to secure the necessary rights from Granada Ventures. His negotiations with the company and its successor, ITV plc, continued for the next few years. In 2008, he expressed his commitment to creating an \"updated\" version, ideally using CGI; three years later, he announced that work on the series had commenced. Following Anderson's death in December 2012, it was confirmed that a deal had been struck between ITV Studios and Pukeko Pictures to remake \"Thunderbirds\" using a combination of CGI and live-action model sets. The new version, \"Thunderbirds Are Go\", was commissioned for two series of 26 episodes each. The first 13 episodes of Series One were broadcast on ITV HD and CITV between April and June 2015.\n\nIn July 2015, to celebrate the series' 50th anniversary, \"Filmed in Supermarionation\" documentary director Stephen La Rivière launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise the funds necessary to produce three new puppet episodes based on the \"Thunderbirds\" mini-albums of the 1960s. The project, titled \"Thunderbirds 1965\", is supported by ITV, Sylvia Anderson and the estate of Gerry Anderson.\n\n\"Thunderbirds\" has influenced TV programmes, films and various other media. The puppet comedy of the film \"\" was directly inspired by the idiosyncrasies of \"Thunderbirds\"-era Supermarionation techniques. Allusion and homage are also evident in \"Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave\", \"\" and \"Spaced\", as well as the character design of \"\". The BBC sketch comedy \"Not Only... But Also\" included a segment titled \"Superthunderstingcar\" – a parody of \"Thunderbirds\", \"Supercar\" and \"Stingray\".\n\nIR's life-saving mission inspired the founding of the volunteer International Rescue Corps, originally made up of a group of British firemen who contributed to the humanitarian effort following the 1980 Irpinia earthquake. Virgin Group has used the series in branding its services: Virgin Atlantic operates a Boeing 747-400 airliner named \"Lady Penelope\", while Virgin Trains owns a fleet of locomotives that are all named after main characters and vehicles and used specifically to \"rescue\" broken-down trains.\n\nA mimed stage show, \"Thunderbirds: F.A.B.\", has toured internationally and popularised a staccato style of movement known colloquially as the \"\"Thunderbirds\" walk\". The production has periodically been revived as \"Thunderbirds: F.A.B. – The Next Generation\".\n\nCover versions of \"The \"Thunderbirds\" March\" have been released by musicians and bands such as Billy Cotton, Joe Loss, Frank Sidebottom, The Rezillos and The Shadows. Groups who have written songs inspired by the series include Fuzzbox (with \"International Rescue\"), TISM (with \"Thunderbirds Are Coming Out\"), Busted (with \"Thunderbirds / 3AM\") and V6 (with \"Thunderbirds – Your Voice\"). In 1991, Anderson filmed the music video for the Dire Straits single \"Calling Elvis\" with a collection of \"Thunderbirds\"-style puppets.\n\nDuring the 1960s, APF produced themed TV advertisements for Lyons Maid and Kellogg's. Aspects of \"Thunderbirds\" have since been used in advertising for Swinton Insurance, Nestlé Kit Kat, Specsavers and the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.\nFootnotes\n\n"}
{"id": "77744", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77744", "title": "Wayne's World (film)", "text": "Wayne's World (film)\n\nWayne's World is a 1992 American comedy film directed by Penelope Spheeris, produced by Lorne Michaels, and written by Mike Myers and Bonnie and Terry Turner. It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and Dana Carvey as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a public-access television show. It also features Rob Lowe, Tia Carrere, Lara Flynn Boyle, Brian Doyle-Murray, Chris Farley, Ed O'Neill, Ione Skye, Meat Loaf, and Alice Cooper.\n\n\"Wayne's World\" was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing film based on \"Saturday Night Live\" skits. A sequel, \"Wayne's World 2\", was released on December 10, 1993.\n\nIn Aurora, Illinois, rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a public-access television show, \"Wayne's World\", from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his Cantonese. He purchases a 1964 Fender Stratocaster electric guitar he has long coveted.\n\nBenjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an Alice Cooper concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a music video for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.\n\nWhile filming the revamped \"Wayne's World\" under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their sponsor, Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of amusement arcades. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.\n\nWayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.\n\nThe \"Wayne's World\" crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.\n\nDissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as \"Old Man Withers\" in a \"Scooby-Doo\" parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a \"mega happy ending\" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.\n\n\n\"Wayne's World\" was greenlit by Paramount Pictures in 1991. It was the second film based on a \"Saturday Night Live\" sketch following \"The Blues Brothers\" in 1980. Producer Lorne Michaels hired Penelope Spheeris to direct, who had directed several music documentaries. Spheeris said, \"I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And \"Wayne's World\" happened, and it sort of flipped my life around.\"\n\nSpheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told \"Entertainment Weekly\" that Myers was \"emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'\" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks, and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel. Myers and Spheeris argued over the final cut of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing \"Wayne' World 2\".\n\nThe movie was a box office success, debuting at number one. The film's final domestic gross was $121,697,323, making it the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and the highest-grossing of the 11 films based on \"Saturday Night Live\" skits.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 84% \"Certified Fresh\" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, \"An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, \"Wayne's World\" is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Roger Ebert said in his review: \"I walked into \"Wayne's World\" expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent.\" However, Desson Howe wrote in the \"Washington Post\" that making a movie out of such a \"teeny sketch\" is \"better than you'd expect\" but criticized the finale as \"an attempt to lampoon movie endings\" \"and a despair-driven inability to end the movie\".\n\nFilled with pop culture references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as \"Schwing!\" and \"Schyea\", as well as popularizing \"That's what she said\", \"Party on!\" and the use of \"Not!\" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary.\n\nAmerican Film Institute recognition:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "25203291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25203291", "title": "Winter of 1990–91 in Western Europe", "text": "Winter of 1990–91 in Western Europe\n\nThe winter of 1990–91 was a particularly cold winter in Western Europe, noted especially for its effect on the United Kingdom, and for two significantly heavy falls of snow which occurred in December 1990 and February 1991. Sandwiched in between was a period of high winds and heavy rain which caused widespread damage. The winter was the coldest since January 1987, and the snowfall experienced in many parts of the United Kingdom would not be seen again until the snowfall of February 2009.\n\nThe snowfall of early December 1990 was particularly disruptive to large parts of the United Kingdom, although heavy snow was also reported across much of Western Europe.\n\nIn the United Kingdom snow began to fall over the Midlands, Wales and the Pennines on the night of 7–8 December 1990 and continued for much of the following day. The rate of snowfall was quite heavy, around an hour, and as a result many areas were covered within half an hour of the snow starting to fall. Coupled with this were high winds which reached gale force in many areas leading to blizzard conditions. Many parts of the Midlands reported at least of snow while depths reached in the Derby area. On the Welsh Mountains there were drifts of up to . Snow fell in Western Europe the following day, 9 December.\n\nTransport was severely disrupted with many people trapped in their cars and all rail services in the Midlands cancelled, while elsewhere in western Europe, roads and airports were closed. In northern Spain traffic officials were forced to shut mountain passes due to heavy snow while rail services in Tessin, southern Switzerland were also severely disrupted. The state's Lugano Airport was also closed. In France the main highway between Lyon and Grenoble was blocked and traffic had to be rerouted, while the Mont Blanc tunnel linking France and Italy through the Alps was also inaccessible. Many roads in parts of Austria's East Tyrol and western Carinthia were closed due to avalanche fears. Snow also fell in Italy where Turin saw its first pre-Christmas snow since 1964. At the same time much of southern Europe experienced high winds and heavy rain, with ferry services suspended in Venice following floods.\n\nThe harsh weather conditions brought down power lines across England leading to loss of electricity for many areas. Power was also disrupted in parts of France. In the UK some 650,000 people were without power, and about 1.2 million without water supplies for several days. The Army was called in to help restore utility supplies to outlying areas. In addition, the adverse weather conditions had a negative economic impact with takings at stores on what was the third Saturday before Christmas considerably lower than normal.\n\nThe severe weather led to the deaths of ten people in the United Kingdom. Three were killed in road accidents in Northern Ireland which was hit by gale force winds. In Austria a 21 car pile up was caused by ice on the Inntal highway injuring several people.\n\nMost of the snow had gone within four days, but its effects were felt for several days afterward. Much of the rest of December was unsettled, and the United Kingdom was hit by heavy storms over the Christmas and New Year period. High winds and heavy rain on Christmas Day caused disruption and power cuts for some parts of the United Kingdom, while the UK and Ireland experienced severe gales on 5 and 6 January 1991. Gusts of up to 70 mph brought down trees and power lines leaving thousands of homes blacked out across Ireland and the southwest of England, resulting in the deaths of 30 people. The dead included 11 crew members who were lost off two merchant vessels, a couple out walking on the beach near Brighton and 13 people who died in Ireland as a result of falling trees and other accidents. Seven of the Irish deaths occurred when a tree crashed onto a minibus.\n\nThe second snow event of the winter occurred in early February 1991 and brought the coldest weather since January 1987. Unlike the previous storm it hit much of Europe, freezing rivers and lakes, and even the canals of Venice which froze over for the first time since 1985. In France the French Riviera experienced its heaviest snowfall for five years leading to traffic chaos – many drivers were stranded on the coastal road between Nice and Antibes, while elsewhere two people were killed after becoming exposed to the cold weather, and horse racing at the Mediterranean resort of Cagnes-sur-Mer was cancelled due to snowfall. The southern Soviet Union which usually experienced fairly mild winters saw temperatures fall to −10C, while Spitsbergen in Norway enjoyed unseasonably mild weather.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the snow was brought in by a cold easterly wind. At first it was mostly concentrated in the eastern counties of England, although it quickly spread inland. By the evening of 6 February many parts of England and Wales were experiencing snow showers, and by the following morning many areas woke to a covering of powdery snow. Along with this came a severe frost coupled with sub-zero temperatures, and heavy snowfalls which continued to fall throughout the day. Temperatures were as low as and did not exceed in many areas. Snow depths were in excess of across England and drifted in the easterly wind. On higher ground levels reached . Villages on Exmoor were cut off by drifts approaching .\n\nOnce again the snow brought travel chaos to much of the country, particularly to the railways, with British Rail making its now infamous excuse that severe delays to services were being caused by the wrong type of snow. Heathrow Airport was forced to cancel flights, while Birmingham and Gatwick were closed.
