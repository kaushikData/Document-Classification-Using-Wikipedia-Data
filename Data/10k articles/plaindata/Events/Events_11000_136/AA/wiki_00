The aim of the offensive was to establish a new supply line into Aleppo city, after an Army-initiated summer campaign had cut off all rebel access to Aleppo.\n\nThe rebels called the operation \"the mother of all battles\", or \"the grand battle of Aleppo\", and described it as possibly deciding the outcome of the war.\n\nAfter making early advances, the rebel offensive soon slowed and stalled. By mid-November, government troops regained control of all areas lost at the start of the rebel offensive, as well as areas lost in the earlier rebel offensive during the summer campaign.\n\nOn 28 October, rebel forces outside Aleppo fired more than 150 shells, mainly BM-21 Grad rockets, at western Aleppo and the Aleppo International Airport, killing more than 15 civilians and wounding at least 100. Rebel groups then announced that they had begun an offensive against the city after detonating three suicide car bombs, one of which was a tank driven by a French Jabhat Fateh al-Sham suicide bomber. The Army also reportedly destroyed two or four other car bombs.\n\nRebels in tanks, armored vehicles, bulldozers, makeshift mine sweepers, pick-up trucks and on motorcycles approached the city. The offensive took place along a 15-kilometer stretch of the frontline. Following the attack by the suicide-bombers on the western outskirts of the city, the rebels seized the Minyan Sawmills, Al-Surah Checkpoint, the Cardboard Factory and most of the Dahiyat Al-Assad suburb, while government troops withdrew to the eastern side of the district so they would not be overrun.\n\nConcurrently, a rebel attack from the southwest in the area of the 1070 Housing Project was repelled, with one rebel tank destroyed and the Army retaining its presence in the northeast section of the Housing Project. Rebel attacks on the nearby 3000 Housing Project and the northwestern Zahra district were also repelled.\n\nIn all, up to eight car bombs, some remotely controlled, were detonated or destroyed at the start of the offensive. In the evening, the Army launched several surface-to-surface missiles on rebel positions in the west of the city.\n\nThe next day, government forces launched a counter-attack against Minyan Industrial and Dahiyat Al-Assad districts. Fighting also took place at the 1070 Housing Project. Later, the rebels started shelling the Hamdaniyah district, in preparation for a new assault, and soon after a suicide car bomb exploded near the Zahra district. The assault against Zahra was eventually repelled, while government troops managed to retake several positions in Dahiyat Al-Assad, where a second suicide car bombing of the day took place. However, by the evening, the rebels managed to take control of the Minyan residential district.\n\nOver the next two days, back and forth fighting took place at the Minyan district, and as of 31 October, control of the district was divided in half.\n\nDuring this time, the Army had also conducted a new counter-attack against Dahiyat Al-Assad. The rebels also launched their own assault on the New Aleppo district and the 1070 and 3000 Housing Projects, where two suicide car bombers blew themselves up. A rebel tank and a technical were destroyed in the fighting at the 3000 Housing Project. During the clashes, the rebels reportedly shelled a residential area of the Hamdaniyah district with chlorine gas, leaving one civilian dead and 15 people injured. The rebels denied this and claimed government forces had themselves used poison gas at one point of the frontline. Ultimately, the rebel attack on the 3000 Housing Project as well as the nearby military complex was repelled.\n\nBy 31 October, the rebel offensive had slowed due to heavy government resistance and pro-government forces had taken the initiative. Three days into the offensive, the rebels were in control of the Minyan Industrial district, most of the Dahiyat Al-Assad district and half of the Minyan residential district. The frontline had stabilized and settled into a stalemate. Since the start of the offensive, the rebels had used 12 suicide car bombers in their attacks.\n\nOn 3 November, the rebels launched the second phase of their offensive, with a triple suicide-bombing against Army positions in the western part of the New Aleppo district and at the Minyan district, in an attempt to revitalize the operation since it had made little progress after the first day. They managed to advance and capture several positions. The rebels also assaulted the 3000 Housing Project and the Al-Assad Military Academy. During the clashes, another rebel tank was destroyed, as well as two Army anti-tank positions. Still, the rebels were not able to break into New Aleppo and their assault was repelled.\nOn 6 November, Army special forces and Hezbollah militiamen launched a counter-attack on the southwestern edge of Aleppo, advancing in the area of Al-Mutha hill and the 1070 Housing Project. The next day, government forces broke through the rebel's first line of defense on Tal Rakhem hill, making advances, while also seizing six buildings in the 1070 Housing Project. Later that day, government forces further advanced in the area and managed to impose fire control over the nearby al-Hikmah school.\n\nOn 8 November, government troops fully captured the 1070 Housing Project, as well as three nearby hills. The rebels additionally withdrew from al-Hikmah school, so to regroup at the Rashiddeen 5 Suburb, but the Army had not yet reached the school due to heavy rebel shelling. Later, government troops launched a large assault inside the Dahiyat Al-Assad and Minyan districts, recapturing Minyan and reportedly advancing inside Dahiyat Al-Assad. That night, the rebels managed to recapture the western half of Minyan. The next day, government troops seized the strategic Hikmah school and secured the Hikmah area, while they made their first push towards the Rashiddeen 5 and Aqrab districts in southwest Aleppo. Later, government troops made their first assault against the Rashiddeen 5 and Aqrab districts in southwest Aleppo.\n\nOn 10 November, government troops recaptured half of the Dahiyat Al-Assad district, including the Science Academy and nearby church. Violent clashes continued between government troops and the rebels in the western part of the district, around the Sourah and Shair checkpoints. The next day, the rebels recaptured all areas lost in Dahiyat Al-Assad, but a new Army attack on the district was soon under way and they once again regained several areas. In an attempt to stop the Army's counter-attack, the rebels sent reinforcements. Concurrently, government forces recaptured the entire Minyan residential district after breaking the rebel's last line of defense. The Army then continued with its assault, attacking the nearby Minyan Sawmills and Carton Factory, and seized the factory. Fighting continued at the sawmills and the Tires Barracks. Later that evening, the Army retook control of Dahiyat Al-Assad district.\n\nOn 12 November, the Army attacked and captured the Sourah checkpoint, west of Dahiyat Al-Assad, turning their attention then to the northern perimeter of the Souq Al-Jabas area. They also fully secured the Minyan industrial district after recapturing the Minyan Sawmills. By this point, government forces had regained control of all areas lost at the start of the rebel offensive, as well as areas lost in the earlier rebel offensive during the summer campaign.\n\nFollowing the successful campaign by pro-government forces, the rebels in eastern-Aleppo were given 24 hours to surrender before the Army started an offensive to completely recapture the rebel-held districts in the east.\n\nAfter the offensive, food and medicine were reportedly smuggled from the YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood into rebel-held eastern Aleppo.\n\nAmnesty International stated that the \"armed opposition groups have displayed a shocking disregard for civilian lives\", deploying weapons \"whose use in the vicinity of densely populated civilian areas flagrantly violates international humanitarian law\". The organization called the rebel groups to \"end all attacks that fail to distinguish between military targets and civilians\".\n\nThe United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, expressed that he was \"appalled and shocked\" by the attacks targeting civilians in Aleppo. He later stated that some rebel groups had been preventing civilians leaving eastern Aleppo.\n"}

It is celebrated in Cambodia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Laos, Myanmar and in countries with Theravada Buddhist populations. Asalha Puja, also known as Dhamma Day, is one of Theravada Buddhism's most important festivals, celebrating as it does the Buddha's first sermon in which he set out to his five former associates the doctrine that had come to him following his enlightenment. This first pivotal sermon, often referred to as “setting into motion the wheel of dhamma,” is the teaching which is encapsulated for Buddhists in the four noble truths: there is suffering (dukkha); suffering is caused by craving (tanha); there is a state (nibbana) beyond suffering and craving; and finally, the way to nirvana is via the eightfold path. All the various schools and traditions of Buddhism revolve around the central doctrine of the four noble truths.\n\nThis first sermon is not only the first structured discourse given by the Buddha after his enlightenment, it also contains the essence of all his subsequent teaching. At the end of the talk, one of the five participants recounted his understanding of what had been said and asked to be received as a disciple, a request the Buddha granted, thus establishing the first order of monks.\n\nThe day is observed by donating offerings to temples and listening to sermons. The following day is known in Thailand as \" Wan Khao Phansa\"; it is the first day of vassa, the Theravada rains retreat.\n\nIn Indonesia, this festival is centered at Mendut Temple, near Borobudur.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "54520422", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=54520422", "title": "Battle of Xiao", "text": "Battle of Xiao\n\nThe Battle of Xiao or Yao () was a battle between Qin and Jin, both of which were major principality states during the Spring and Autumn Period of Zhou dynasty. It occurred in 627 BC at the Xiao Mountains, a branch of the Qinling Range between Yellow River and Luo River, in modern-day Henan province of China.\n\nIn 632 BC, the Battle of Chengpu broke out between Jin and Chu. Chu was defeated, and the Duke Wen of Jin became one of Five Hegemons of Spring and Autumn Period. State of Zheng was an ally of Chu, so after the battle, Jin planned to invade Zheng for revenge. In 630, Jin attacked Zheng and besieged its capital city. Qin also joined the force of Jin as Duke Mu of Qin was a follower to the Duke Wen of Jin.\n\nZhu Zhiwu, a person from Zheng, visited Duke Mu of Qin at night. He told the Duke Mu of Qin that if Zheng was conquered, there would be no benefit to Qin because they did not share a border at that time. On the other hand, Jin would occupy Zheng's territory. It would make Jin stronger and a greater threat to Qin. He pointed out that if Qin gave up attacking the city, Zheng would be willing to be an ally of Qin in the future to potentially fight against Jin. He successfully persuaded Duke Mu of Qin to retreat. Before going back, Duke Mu of Qin appointed three generals to stay at Zheng in order to help Zheng defend their capital city. Since then, the ally between Qin and Jin did not exist any more.\n\nJin failed to conquer Zheng because of the absence of Qin. Two years later, Duke Wen of Jin died. His son succeed the crown as Duke Xiang of Jin. Meanwhile, state Qin gradually became stronger under Duke Mu's reign. Qin defeated several small states and extended its territory towards Zheng. As Zheng was not so far away anymore, Qin began to think about conquering Zheng. At this time, those three generals stayed with Zheng sent a message to Qin that if the army of Qin attacked Zheng, they would open the northern gate of Zheng's capital city to coordinate with the campaign. \n\nJian Shu, a governor of Qin, disliked the idea of attacking Zheng. He asked Duke Mu to abandon this plan because it might cause potential crisis. However, Duke Mu had made his mind and continued the plan. In 627 BC, the duke appointed Baili Mengming (son of Baili Xi), Xi Wi Shu and Bai Yibing as generals to launch a surprise attack to Zheng. To enter the territory of Zheng, Qin army had to pass by the northern gate of Luoyang, the city in which the king of Zhou lives. The king of Zhou was regarded as the son of heaven. According to traditional manners, soldiers needed to take off their hamlets when passing by the city of Luoyang. Qin soldiers, however, did not do so. People in the city were astonished, and some people pointed out that Qin soldiers could not win the war because they were too arrogant. \n\nWhen the Qin army reached State of Hua, a hunter from Zheng noticed them. The hunter knew that there was not enough time for him to run back to Zheng to warm everybody, so he decided to fool the Qin army on his own. He paid tribute to generals of Qin in the name of Zheng. After receiving the tribute, generals of Qin thought that Zheng knew they were coming and was well prepared for the war, so they gave up the plan of attacking Zheng. Instead, they conquered Hua and retreated. In reality, Zheng did not know anything about the coming Qin army.\n\nThe Duke Xiang of Jin learned what Qin was trying to do. He was annoyed because he knew that Qin was not only trying to conquer Zheng but also trying to challenge the authority of Jin. To give Qin a lesson, Duke Xiang of Jin allied with the Jiang Rong tribe (a Rong people living in the Han River valley) to launch a campaign against Qin. They planned to ambush Qin in the Xiao Mountains which was on the route of Qin's retreat. The army of Qin led by those three generals were still retreating from Hua, and they were not prepared to fight against the mighty Jin. These two forces collided at Xiao. Jin army was superior and easily won the battle. Three generals of Qin were all captured by Jin.\n\nAfter that, Wen Ying, who was a concubine of Duke Wen of Jin, also a daughter of Duke Mu of Qin, entreated Duke Xiang of Jin to release the three generals so that they would be punished in Qin, which was the desire of Duke Mu of Qin as she said. Her entreaty was accepted by Duke Xiang of Jin and the three generals were released and went back to Qin later.\n\nWhen the Qin army returned, Duke Mu of Qin put on white clothes to wait for them, crying that it was all his fault because he had not listened to Jian Shu's advice. Therefore, the three generals were not punished by Duke Mu of Qin.\n\nAs a result of this battle, Jin solidified its status as the most powerful state in northern China for next several decades. Qin suffered a significant loss. About 30,000 men, most of who were elite soldiers in the army, were killed in the battle. For a long period of time after the battle, Qin had no power to continue its eastward expansion. Instead, they turned around and began to expand towards the west. During this process, they clashed with several barbarians and nomadic groups and conquered several smaller states in the west and northwest. The westward expansion helped Qin to build up its power and laid the root for its being a strong state and the eventual unification of China.\n"}

Cal Expo is governed by an appointed 11-member Board of Directors and daily operations are managed by the chief executive officer (selected by the Board). During the annual State Fair more than 2,000 seasonal temporary employees are hired. The California Exposition is a self-sufficient operation that receives no government funding but still has an estimated economic impact of more than $250 million on the region.\n\nThe California legislature created the State Agricultural Society to promote California's reputation for farming and industry. An agricultural exposition was organized and held in San Francisco in 1854, and California Historic Landmark #861 marks the site. Given that travel was difficult in that era, the next several annual expositions were moved around the state, to Sacramento, San Jose, Stockton, and Marysville.\n\nIn 1859 the exposition returned to Sacramento, and it was decided that a permanent site should be found. Capitol Park, a six block site bounded by E, H, 20th and 22nd Streets () was purchased and was home to the state fair for the next fifty years.\n\nGrowth in population and attendance forced the purchase of just outside the city limits on Stockton Boulevard (), and the first fair was held there in 1909. Continued growth caused that site to be expanded by in 1937. During and after World War II, from 1942 to 1947, the Fair was suspended and the fairgrounds were occupied by the Army. During its formative years(1929-1942?), the California Highway Patrol used some of the State Fair facilities as an unofficial \"training academy\", later using other state-owned areas in the Sacramento area for training use until the current CHP Academy was opened in 1976.\n\nIn 1948, the state purchased approximately 900 acres of undeveloped land along the American River north of downtown Sacramento. Funds were not allocated to begin construction on this land until 1963, and the State Fair continued at the Stockton Boulevard grounds until 1967. In 1968, Governor Ronald Reagan opened the new \"Cal Expo\" site, which covers over of developed land at .\n\nCal Expo has seen limited changes over the years. Following the tragic attacks of 9/11, a memorial plaza was installed in 2002. In 2012, the Disneyland Resort donated to Cal Expo the iconic 'CALIFORNIA' letters that previously stood in front of Disney California Adventure from its 2001 opening until 2011. The letters now stand at the entrance to the Expo.\n\nIn addition to the annual State Fair, Cal Expo hosts a number of other community, trade and business events, including the annual State Fair Gala (supporting scholarships), Sacramento County Fair, International Sportsman Expo, Western States Horse Expo and a number of other RV, auto and special collectible trade shows.\n\nThe one-mile dirt racetrack at Cal Expo hosts live thoroughbred racing during the annual State Fair and live harness racing (September through May), in addition to special events like the Sacramento Mile Auto-race. The old California State Fairgrounds Race Track hosted USAC National Championship races.\n\nCal Expo is home to one of two operating permanent monorail system in California - the only other can be found at Disneyland. The iconic monorail was installed during the creation of its existing grounds in 1968 by Universal Mobility Incorporated. The Monorail ride is only open for public use during the annual State Fair and is a great way to see the grounds from above. The storage facility for the monorail trams are located in the northwest corner of the grounds. Each tram features a different California symbol, like the California Golden Poppy or California Quail.\n\nCarnival rides and games are operated by Butler Amusements, Inc. Butler Amusements' first year at the state fair was in 2009. Rides and games were operated by RCS Amusements for a number of years before that.\n\n"}

A research paper presented to the UK Parliament in July 2013 proposed a number of alternatives to membership which would continue to allow access to the EU internal market. These include remaining in the European Economic Area (EEA) as a European Free Trade Association (EFTA) member (alongside Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway), or seeking to negotiate bilateral terms more akin to the Swiss model with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements. The exit from the EU without EEA membership or a trade agreement is known as the WTO option.\n\nA transitional arrangement may apply between the time the UK leaves the EU and the coming into force of the final relationship. The report from the first phase of Brexit negotiations (June to December 2017) mentioned the possibility of agreeing a transitional arrangement during the second phase.\n\nThe UK could seek to continue to be a member of the European Economic Area as a member of EFTA. In January 2017, Theresa May, the British Prime Minister, announced a 12-point plan of negotiating objectives and said that the UK government would not seek continued membership in the single market. EEA membership would mean being under existing EU internal market legislation that is part of the EEA Agreement. Some EU law originates from various international bodies on which non-EU EEA countries have a seat. EFTA members are free to set their own policies in areas such as agriculture, fisheries, Customs Union, trade, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, direct and indirect taxation and criminal matters. EEA countries are required to contribute to the EU Budget in exchange for access to the internal market. The UK would be subject to the EFTA Court rather than the European Court of Justice.\n\nSeeking to negotiate bilateral terms more along the Swiss model with a series of interdependent sectoral agreements. Britain has not negotiated a trade agreement since before 1973, and the government is looking to the private sector for assistance. \n\nThe WTO option would involve the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without any Free Trade Agreement and relying on the trading rules set by the World Trade Organization.\n\nThe EEA Agreement and the agreement with Switzerland cover free movement of goods, and free movement of people. Many supporters of Brexit want to restrict freedom of movement; Liechtenstein has a de facto permanent limit on the free movement of persons, though the EEA Joint Committee said this was because of Liechtenstein's specific geographical situation. Also, an EEA Agreement would include free movement for EU and EEA citizens, although the EEA Agreement allows EEA EFTA states to suspend it temporarily due to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties. Passport systems allow EEA institutions to access markets in EU Member States, for the most part, without having to establish subsidiaries in each EU Member State and incur the costs of full authorisation in those jurisdiction. Others present ideas of a Swiss solution, that is tailor-made agreements between the UK and the EU, but EU representatives have claimed they would not support such a solution. The Swiss agreements contain free movement for EU citizens. (The Swiss immigration referendum, February 2014 voted narrowly in favour of an end to the 'free movement' agreement, by February 2017. However, the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union are all co-dependent: if one is terminated then all are terminated. Consequently, should Switzerland choose unilaterally to cancel the 'free movement' agreement then all its agreements with the EU will lapse unless a compromise is found. A compromise was reached in December 2016, effectively canceling quotas on EU citizens but still allowing for favorable treatment of Swiss-based job applicants c).\n\nSeveral thousand British citizens resident in other EU countries have after the referendum applied for citizenship where they live, since they fear losing the right to work there.\n\nAn EU position paper stated: “The Withdrawal Agreement should establish institutional arrangements to ensure the effective management, implementation and enforcement of the Agreement. It should include appropriate dispute settlement mechanisms regarding the application and interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement.\nThe Withdrawal Agreement should respect the Union's autonomy. The Withdrawal Agreement should provide that both The Union and the United Kingdom supervise the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement.”\n"}
{"id": "14876828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14876828", "title": "Croatian–Bulgarian wars", "text": "Croatian–Bulgarian wars\n\nThe Croatian–Bulgarian Wars were a series of conflicts that erupted three times during the 9th and 10th centuries between the medieval realms of Croatia and Bulgaria. During these wars, Croatia formed alliances with Eastern Francia and Byzantium against the Bulgarian Empire.\n\nDuring the middle of the 9th century, Bulgaria was the dominant power in the central, eastern, and northern Balkans. In 854, the Bulgarian ruler Boris I forged an official alliance with the Moravian prince Rastislav against Louis the German of East Francia. Duke Trpimir of Croatia was a faithful Frankish vassal and was wary of Bulgaria's ongoing expansion when it reached Croatian borders after the wars against Rascia. Bulgaria is said to have invaded Croatia in approximately 854, but there is also a possibility that King Louis gave some compensation to Trpimir to attack Bulgaria. During the war of 854, there was only one great battle on the territory of present-day northeastern Bosnia, and neither side emerged victorious. Soon afterward, peace negotiations began between Boris of Bulgaria and Trpimir of Croatia, resulting in gifts exchanged and the establishment of peace, with the border between the Croatian Duchy and Bulgaria stabilized at the river of Drina (between modern-day Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republic of Serbia).\n\nA very long and arduous war was prosecuted between the Bulgarian Tsar Simeon I, who wanted to take over the Byzantine Empire, and the Empire's monarch Romanos I. Under heavy pressure from the Bulgarians and amassing defeat after defeat, the Byzantine Empire negotiated with Serbia and Croatia in an effort to forge an alliance against the Bulgarians. Having been informed of these plans by Prince Michael of Zachlumia, who was forced to the islands as the Serbian rulers took direct control of most of his local lands for themselves, Simeon overran Serbia in 924, destroyed it by tricking its nobility, and made it directly part of the Bulgarian Empire. Serbia's ruler Zaharija Pribislavljević fled and found exile at the Croatian court, while after the realm's destruction massive waves of Serb refugees fled and found refuge in Tomislav's Croatia. Trying to gain Croatian entry into this coalition, Romanos I ordered the province of Dalmatia in ca. 925 to pay taxes not to Byzantium but rather to the Croatian state; the Dalmatian territories, including most cities and the northern islands, were henceforth administered by King Tomislav and were to remain under Croatia. Tsar Simeon sent Duke Alogobotur to drive the Serb refugees further into Croatia, causing outright war in ca. 926.\n\nThe climax of the war was the Battle of the Bosnian Highlands that same year, when Croatian forces under the command of King Tomislav completely defeated the Bulgarian forces under the command of Alogobotur, killing most of the Bulgarians in the battle. The Croatian victory was so decisive and the battle so big that contemporary sources greatly overestimated Croatia's Army at 160,000 men, with a slightly bigger force on the Bulgarian side. This was the only battle Tsar Simeon ever lost. Since both rulers maintained good relations with Pope John X, the pope was able to negotiate an end to the war soon afterward without any further border changes. Although the eastern border was extended down to the river of Bosnia, the Croatian realm was greatly strengthened both militarily and in natural resources: it emerged from the war as one of the most modern realms of the period and was able to consolidate a moderately sized navy. On the same day as the battle Simeon died in Preslav and his successor Peter I faced internal difficulties and revolts by his brothers Michail and Ivan. The Serbs were able to take advantage of this situation and many of them returned by 931 to their homes in the renewed Serbian realm, thus terminating Croatia's short-lived Bulgarian neighbor at the east.\n\nIn the second half of the 10th century, the Croatian realm was ruled by Stjepan Držislav. Stjepan formed an alliance with the Byzantine Empire, which in turn recognized him as the King of his lands. After his death in 997, his son Svetoslav Suronja continued his pro-Byzantine policy. His brothers Krešimir III and Gojslav did not want Svetoslav as ruler and attempted a coup d'etat, asking the Bulgarian tsar Samuil for help. Answering their call, Samuil went on a rampage in 998 and razed the Dalmatian cities of Trogir and Split, but he was stopped at the siege of Zadar. The Bulgarian forces then returned home, using the Bosnian route. Territory taken by Samuil during the war was given to Krešimir III and Gojslav, who, with further Bulgarian support, won the Croatian civil war and took over the realm in the year 1000. Svetoslav Suronja, a Byzantine and Venetian ally, was sent to exile in Venice, but after a change in government there he was exiled to Hungary. Following the death of Ivan Vladislav in 1018, Bulgaria fell under Byzantine rule, and Krešimir III and Gojslav, the two Croatian kings, became Byzantine vassals.\n"}

{"id": "336211", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=336211", "title": "Ern Malley", "text": "Ern Malley\n\nErnest Lalor \"Ern\" Malley was a fictitious poet and the central figure in Australia's most famous literary hoax. He and his entire body of work were created in one day in 1943 by conservative writers James McAuley and Harold Stewart in order to hoax Max Harris and his modernist magazine \"Angry Penguins\", which Harris co-edited with John Reed of Heide, Melbourne. Imitating the modernist poetry they despised, the hoaxers deliberately created what they thought was bad verse and submitted sixteen poems to \"Angry Penguins\" under the guise of Ethel, Ern Malley's surviving sister. Harris and other members of the Heide Circle fell for the hoax, and, enraptured by the poetry, devoted the next issue of \"Angry Penguins\" to Malley. The hoax was revealed soon after, resulting in a \"cause célèbre\" and the humiliation of Harris, who was put on trial, convicted and fined for publishing the poems on the grounds that they contained obscene content. \"Angry Penguins\" folded in 1946.\n\nIn the decades that followed, the hoax proved to be a significant setback for modernist poetry in Australia. Since the 1970s, however, the Ern Malley poems, though known to be a hoax, became celebrated as a successful example of surrealist poetry in their own right, lauded by poets and critics such as John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch and Robert Hughes. The poems of Ern Malley are now more widely read than those of his creators, and the affair has inspired works by major Australian writers and artists, such as Peter Carey and Sidney Nolan. American poet and anthologist David Lehman called Ern Malley \"the greatest literary hoax of the twentieth century\".\n\nJames McAuley and Harold Stewart were both, in 1944, in the Army Directorate of Research and Civil Affairs. Before the war they had been part of Sydney's Bohemian arts world. McAuley had acted and sung in left-wing revues at Sydney University. Both preferred early Modernism to its later forms. McAuley, for example, claimed that T. S. Eliot's \"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\" (1917) was genius, but the subsequent \"The Waste Land\" (1922), regarded by many as Eliot's finest achievement, was an incoherent mess. Both men lamented \"the loss of meaning and craftsmanship\" in poetry. They particularly despised the well-funded modernist poetry magazine \"Angry Penguins\" and were resentful of the precocious success of Max Harris, the magazine's founder and editor.\n\nHarris was a 22-year-old \"avant-garde\" poet and critic in Adelaide, who in 1940, at the age of 18, had started \"Angry Penguins\".\n\nMcAuley and Stewart decided to perpetrate a hoax on Harris and \"Angry Penguins\" by submitting to the magazine nonsensical poetry, which they felt captured the worst of modernist tendencies, under the guise of a fictional poet. They came up with a fictional biography for the poet \"Ernest Lalor Malley\", who, they claimed, had died the year before at the age of 25. The name is a \"highly Australian-sounding handle\": \"Malley\" is a pun on the word \"mallee\", denoting a class of Australian vegetation and a bird, the native malleefowl, and \"Lalor\" recalls Peter Lalor, leader of the 1854 Eureka Rebellion. Then, in one afternoon, they wrote his entire body of work: 17 poems, none longer than a page, and all intended to be read in sequence under the title \"The Darkening Ecliptic\".\n\nTheir writing style, as they described it, was to write down the first thing that came into their heads, lifting words and phrases from the \"Concise Oxford Dictionary\", a \"Collected Shakespeare\", and a \"Dictionary of Quotations\": \"We opened books at random, choosing a word or phrase haphazardly. We made lists of these and wove them in nonsensical sentences. We misquoted and made false allusions. We deliberately perpetrated bad verse, and selected awkward rhymes from a \"Ripman's Rhyming Dictionary\".\" They also included many bits of their own poetry, though in a deliberately disjointed manner.\n\nThe first poem in the sequence, \"Durer: Innsbruck, 1495\", was an unpublished serious effort by McAuley, edited to appeal to Harris:\n<poem>I had often cowled in the slumbrous heavy air,\nClosed my inanimate lids to find it real,\nAs I knew it would be, the colourful spires\nAnd painted roofs, the high snows glimpsed at the back,\nAll reversed in the quiet reflecting waters –\nNot knowing then that Durer perceived it too.\nNow I find that once more I have shrunk\nTo an interloper, robber of dead men's dream,\nI had read in books that art is not easy\nBut no one warned that the mind repeats\nIn its ignorance the vision of others. I am still\nThe black swan of trespass on alien waters.</poem>\n\nDavid Brooks theorises in his 2011 book, \"The Sons of Clovis: Ern Malley, Adoré Floupette and a Secret History of Australian Poetry\", that the Ern Malley hoax was modelled on the 1885 satire on French Symbolism and the Decadent movement, \"Les Déliquescences d'Adoré Floupette\" by Henri Beauclair and Gabriel Vicaire. Stewart claimed to have never heard of Floupette at the time of the Ern Malley hoax, and while there is no evidence McAuley had, his Masters thesis titled \"Symbolism: an essay in poetics\", included a study of French Symboliste poetry and poetics.\n\nAccording to his inventors' fictitious biography, Ernest Lalor Malley was born in Liverpool, England, on 14 March 1918. His father died in 1920, and Malley's mother migrated to Petersham, a suburb of Sydney, Australia, with her two children: Ern, and his older sister Ethel. After his mother's death in August 1933, Ern Malley left school to work as an auto mechanic. Shortly after his seventeenth birthday, he then moved to Melbourne where he lived alone and worked as an insurance salesman, and later as a watch repairman. Diagnosed with Graves' disease sometime in the early 1940s, Malley refused treatment. He returned to Sydney, moving in with his sister in March, 1943, where he became increasingly ill (as well as temperamental and difficult) until his death at the age of 25 on 23 July of that same year.\n\nMalley's life as a poet became known only after his sister Ethel (another fictitious creation of McAuley and Stewart) found a pile of unpublished poems among his belongings. These poems featured a brief preface, which explained that they had been composed over a period of five years, but it left no instructions as to what was to be done with them. Ethel Malley supposedly knew nothing about poetry, but showed the poems to a friend, who suggested that she send the poems to someone who could examine them. Max Harris of \"Angry Penguins\" was to be that someone.\n\nMcAuley and Stewart then sent Harris a letter, purported to be from Ethel, containing the poems, and asking for his opinion of her late brother's work.\n\nHarris read the poems with, as he later recalled, a mounting sense of excitement. Ern Malley, he thought, was a poet in the same class as W. H. Auden or Dylan Thomas. He showed them to his circle of literary friends, who agreed that a hitherto completely unknown modernist poet of great importance had been discovered in suburban Australia. He decided to rush out a special edition of \"Angry Penguins\" and commissioned a painting by Sidney Nolan, based on the poems, for the cover.\n\nThe \"Autumn 1944\" edition of \"Angry Penguins\" appeared in June 1944 owing to wartime printing delays. Harris eagerly promoted it around the small world of Australian writers and critics. The reaction was not what he had hoped or expected. An article appeared in the University of Adelaide student newspaper ridiculing the Malley poems and suggesting that Harris had written them himself in some elaborate hoax.\n\nOn 17 June, the Adelaide \"Daily Mail\" raised the possibility that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or had ever done so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney \"Sunday Sun\", which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.\n\nThe South Australian police impounded the issue of \"Angry Penguins\" devoted to \"The Darkening Ecliptic\" on the grounds that Malley's poems were obscene.\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax was on the front pages of the newspapers for weeks, and Harris was humiliated.\n\nAfter the hoax was revealed, McAuley and Stewart wrote:\nMr. Max Harris and other \"Angry Penguins\" writers represent an Australian outcrop of a literary fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be \"intellectuals\" and \"Bohemians\", both here and abroad, as \"great poetry\". [...] However, it was possible that we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair enough. If Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.\n\n\"Angry Penguins\" soon folded, although the magazine's demise had more to do with a libel case brought against Harris for an unconnected review and the emotional fallout from events in the open marriage of its backers John Reed and his wife, Sunday.\n\nMost people, including most educated people with an interest in the arts, were persuaded of the validity of McAuley and Stewart's \"experiment.\" The two had deliberately written bad poetry, passed it off under a plausible alias to the country's most prominent publisher of modernist poetry, and completely taken him in. Harris, they said, could not tell real poetry from fake, good from bad.\n\nThe Ern Malley hoax had long-lasting repercussions. To quote the \"Oxford Companion to Australian Literature\", \"More important than the hoax itself was the effect it had on the development of Australian poetry. The vigorous and legitimate movement for modernism in Australian writing, espoused by many writers and critics in addition to the members of the \"Angry Penguins\" group, received a severe setback, and the conservative element was undoubtedly strengthened.\"\n\nControversy over Ern Malley continued for more than twenty years. It spread beyond Australia when it was learned that the British literary critic Herbert Read had been taken in by the hoax. Modernist novelists like Patrick White and abstract painters found themselves tarred with the Ern Malley brush. Since both McAuley and Stewart and the left-wing nationalist school around Vance and Nettie Palmer disliked the \"Angry Penguins\" version of modernism with equal venom, though for different reasons, Ern Malley cast a long shadow over Australian cultural life.\n\nIn a 1975 interview with Earle Hackett, Sidney Nolan credited Ern Malley with inspiring him to paint his first Ned Kelly series (1946–47), saying \"It made me take the risk of putting against the Australian bush an utterly strange object.\"\n\nMcAuley went on to publish several volumes of poetry and, with Richard Krygier, founded the literary and cultural journal \"Quadrant\". From 1961 he was professor of English at the University of Tasmania. He died in 1976.\n\nStewart settled permanently in Japan in 1966 and published two volumes of translations of traditional Japanese poetry which became best-sellers in Australia. He died in 1995.\n\nHarris, however, once he recovered from his humiliation in the Ern Malley hoax, made the best of his notoriety. From 1951 to 1955, he published another literary magazine, which he called \"Ern Malley's Journal\". In 1961, as a gesture of defiance, he re-published the Ern Malley poems, maintaining that whatever McAuley and Stewart had \"intended\" to do, they had, in fact, produced some memorable poems. Harris went on to become a successful bookseller and newspaper columnist. His political views moved significantly to the right as he got older (he had been a member of the Communist Party at the time of the hoax), and in the mid-1960s, he claimed to sympathise with McAuley and Stewart's motivations in creating Ern Malley. Harris died in 1995.\n\nThe fictional Ern Malley achieved a measure of celebrity. The poems are regularly re-published and quoted. There have been at least 20 publications of the \"Darkening Ecliptic\", either complete or partial. It has reappeared – not only in Australia, but in London, Paris, Lyons, Kyoto, New York and Los Angeles – with a regularity that would be the envy of any real Australian poet.\n\nSome literary critics take the view that McAuley and Stewart outsmarted themselves in their concoction of the Ern Malley poems. \"Sometimes the myth is greater than its creators,\" Max Harris wrote. Harris, of course, had a vested interest in Malley, but others have agreed with his assessment. Robert Hughes wrote:\n\nThe basic case made by Ern's defenders was that his creation proved the validity of surrealist procedures: that in letting down their guard, opening themselves to free association and chance, McAuley and Stewart had reached inspiration by the side-door of parody; and though this can't be argued on behalf of all the poems, some of which are partly or wholly gibberish, it contains a ponderable truth... The energy of invention that McAuley and Stewart brought to their concoction of Ern Malley created an icon of literary value, and that is why he continues to haunt our culture.\n\nIn the \"Individual Notes on Works and Authors\" in the \"Special Collaborations Issue\" of Locus Solus, Kenneth Koch wrote, \"Though Harris was wrong about who Ern Malley 'was' (if one can use that word here), I find it hard not to agree with his judgment of Malley's poetry.\"\n\nThe American poet John Ashbery said of Ern Malley, in a 1988 interview in the magazine \"Jacket\":\nI think it was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, and I discovered a wonderful bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of \"The Darkening Ecliptic\" with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course [at Brooklyn College, NY], which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up there is no way of examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... [the] fraudulent poem.\n\nTwo exhibitions by major Australian galleries have been based on Ern Malley. In 1974 the Art Gallery of South Australia’s Adelaide Festival Exhibitions included the Sidney Nolan exhibition \"Ern Malley and Paradise Garden\". The 2009 exhibition \"Ern Malley: The Hoax and Beyond\" at Heide Museum of Modern Art was the first exhibition to thoroughly investigate the genesis, reception and aftermath of the hoax.\n\nThe final irony is enduring fame: Malley is better known and more widely read today than either McAuley or Stewart.\n\nThe Australian historian Humphrey McQueen alluded to the poems in calling his 1979 history of modernism in Australia \"The Black Swan of Trespass\".\n\nSeveral works of fiction attribute the poems to a third party who actually wrote them; they then fall into the hands of McAuley and Stewart. In 1977 in \"Overland\", Barbara Ker Wilson wrote a short story \"Black Swan of Trespass\", in which she has Davydd Davis, who presents as an antipodean Dylan Thomas, writing the poems. \"Malarky Dry\", by Ian Kennedy Williams, was published in 1990 and tells of a sickly, insipid Ern who writes a manual of motorcycle maintenance while a boring bureaucrat Henry Fitzhubert-Ireland writes the poems. Two more recent fictions invent a \"real\" Ern: \"Strangers in the House of the Mind\" which appears in Martin Edmond's 2007 collection \"Waimarino County & Other Excursions\", and David Malley's \"Beyond is Anything\".\n\nJoanna Murray-Smith's play \"Angry Young Penguins\" (1987) is based on these events.\n\nPeter Carey's 2003 novel \"My Life as a Fake\" draws some of its inspiration from the Ern Malley affair. Elliot Perlman recounts the tale of the Ern Malley hoax in his 2003 novel \"Seven Types of Ambiguity\". In 2005, \"The Black Swan of Trespass\", a surrealist play about the real life of a fictional Ern Malley by Lally Katz and Chris Kohn, premiered at the Melbourne Malthouse Theatre.\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, the artist Garry Shead produced a series of well-received paintings based on the Ern Malley hoax.\n\nIn the 2013 novel \"Cairo\", after the success of a fictionalized version of the theft of the one of Picasso's studies for \"The Weeping Woman\", one of characters quotes Malley's \"Durer: Innsbruck, 1495\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is pattern or shadow team dancing by couples in a formation team. The choreography may be based on a particular dance or a medley of dances. Formation dancing may be done for exhibition or for competition between teams. There is also a type of formation in Bhangra.\n\nFormation dancing originated in 1932 in London's Astoria Ballroom. It was Olive Ripman who introduced it under the name \"pattern dancing\". Soon it became a competitive dance form. \n\nFormation team contests began in the 1930s in England, and spread to many other countries. International matches have taken place. Formation dances were an important part of the BBC TV program \"Come Dancing\" when Frank and Peggy Spencer's formation teams competed against Constance Millington's team. The peak of popularity was in the 1960s, and is now growing from strength to strength with formation teams from all over the world competing against each other.\n\nThe choreography of a formation team includes both choreography of a dancesport routine of an individual couple and the overall pattern of movements of the couples on the floor. All couples are expected to follow the beat of the music and movements should be executed simultaneously. Teams are marked on their synchronicity\n\nLatin Dancesport formation is a medley of dances that include the 5 International Latin dances: Cha Cha, Rumba, Jive, Paso Doble and Samba. \n\nStandard or Ballroom formation is a medley of the 5 international ballroom dances Waltz, Quickstep, Tango, Viennese Waltz and Foxtrot.\n\nThe routines generally feature at least some free-form choreography in the walk on and walk off, which may include movements from jazz dance, ballet, or any other type of dance. This is clearly marked by a gong.\nA complete routine usually lasts a total of 6 minutes.\n\nFormation routines allow dancers to show off their own technique in addition to their ability to move as a team.\nUnlike individual competitions tricks such as \"round abouts\", \"chain reactions\" form a large section of the choreography.\n\nShapes (also known as patterns or images) that are an accepted part of choreography are diamonds, squares, diagonals, circles and lines. The routine is judged by the distribution of competitors across the floor, how \"readable\" the patterns are and the transitions between these patterns.\n\nSpecialist formation choreographers include Ona Skaistutė Idzelevičienė, Roberto Albanese, Horst Beer, and Rachael Holland.\n\nThe international governing body is the International DanceSport Federation (IDSF) (which has Olympic recognition). Competing teams must be a member of one of its member organisations such as the English amateur dancesport association ltd (EADA)\n\nThe following is a summary of the IDSF rules for European and World Formation competitions.\n\nIn early rounds, judges mark if they believe teams should go through to the next round. In final rounds teams are ranked and the skating system applies.\n\nOther competitions of note are the Blackpool Dance Festival and the Donaupokal Invitational Competition Vienna.\nGermany is notable in having several leagues of formation teams, and holds several competitions each year.\n\nThis is a list of Adult Formation Teams competing in 2013 in the IDSF World Ranking Competition.

It was premiered at the Teatro Regio in Turin on 19 February 1914, and is still staged occasionally.\n\nThis opera is Zandonai's best-known work. In the \"New Grove Dictionary of Opera\", Renato Chiesa calls it \"one of the most original and polished Italian melodramas of the 20th century, [which] combines a powerful gift for Italian melody ... with an exceptional command of orchestration.\" Celebrated performers of the title role have included Gilda Dalla Rizza, Magda Olivero (who recorded excerpts from the opera in 1969, for Decca Records) and Renata Scotto. \n\nThe story takes place in Ravenna and Rimini.\n\nFrancesca, daughter of Guido I da Polenta, for state reasons, is to be married to Giovanni, known as Gianciotto, the malformed son of Malatesta da Verucchio. But as Francesca would certainly refuse to marry the lame and deformed Gianciotto, she is introduced in the first act, by means of a well-laid plot, to his handsome younger brother, Paolo, known as \"Il bello\". Under the impression that Paolo is her destined bridegroom, Francesca falls deeply in love with him at first sight; he also falls passionately in love with her, although they do not exchange a single word.\n\nThe next act shows a fight in progress between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, and on the platform of a tower of the Malatesti. Francesca, now married to Gianciotto, meets Paolo and gently reproaches him for the fraud practised on her. He protests his innocence of the plot and reveals his intense passion for her. Gianciotto brings the news of Paolo's election as Captain of the People and Commune of Florence. Paolo departs for Florence.\n\nIn the third act Francesca, in her luxurious apartment, is reading the story of Lancelot and Guinevere to her women. They then dance and sing in celebration of the advent of Spring, until, on a whispered word from her slave, Francesca dismisses them. Paolo, sick with longing for her, has returned from Florence. He enters; they continue reading the story of Guinevere together, until, no longer in control of their feelings, they let their lips meet in a long kiss.\n\nIn the fourth act Malatestino, Gianciotto's youngest brother, who himself lusts for Francesca, has discovered her secret meetings with Paolo. After Francesca refuses to give in to his sexual advances, Malatestino betrays Francesca and Paolo to Gianciotto, who determines to find out the truth for himself. Accordingly, Gianciotto lies in wait outside Francesca's door, and surprising her and Paolo together at early dawn, he slays them both.\n\n\n"}

The festival is held each September at Wolf Trap National Park for the Performing Arts in Fairfax County, Virginia, which is the United States' only national park devoted solely to the performing arts. First conceived in 1971 as \"International Children's Day\", the festival provides opportunities for children to share aspects of their culture through the arts. The founder of the Wolf trap National Park for Performing Arts, Catherine Filene Shouse, also originated the festival.\n\nThe International Children's Festival is sponsored by the Arts Council of Fairfax County in cooperation with the Wolf Trap Foundation for the Performing Arts and the National Park Service. Proceeds from the annual festival support the educational programs and services of the Arts Council of Fairfax County. It is held annually in September, typically on the 3rd weekend of the month. By the end of 2011, it was decided to conclude the tradition, amid financial issues.\n\nThe two-day weekend festival features many performers from several countries in musical and dance performances in four stages representative of their cultural heritage. The performers are dressed in traditional clothing and play many traditional songs which they dance to. Also featured are an Arts and Technology Pavilion with hands-on technology stations, international experiential tents where attendees can meet the international performers, learn the moves they saw on stage, and participate in craft projects to help them learn about international culture, and the Creative Kids Workshop featuring pavilions for hands-on arts projects and an instrument petting zoo.\n\nAn educational curriculum co-developed by the Arts Council of Fairfax County and Fairfax County Public Schools supports the learning opportunities available to students at the International Children's Festival. The curriculum is directed toward fifth grade classes and is also available for home-school and private school programs.\n\nEach year since 1994 the Festival has been the designated fine arts field trip for the entire 5th grade population in Fairfax County Public Schools – resulting in over 13,000 students coming to Wolf Trap during the week to see and meet the featured performers. The year 2001 was a particularly interesting year for the festival as thousands of students were en route to Wolf Trap when the events of September 11, 2001 took place.\n\nThe Festival includes not only the featured international performers, but also dozens of Fairfax County and Washington DC metropolitan area arts organizations. In total, the festival features over 400 area performing and visual artists representing a diverse range of art forms, genres, and cultures. With the assistance of the community, each year free tickets, gifts, and snacks are provided to nearly 2,000 Washington DC area children and their families who would otherwise be unable to attend.\n\nThe International Children's Festival relies on over 3,500 volunteer hours from 700 volunteers from local corporations and service organizations. Volunteers for the actual festival must be at least 16 years of age and available to work a 3.5 hour shift.\n\nFor over 15 years Bob McGrath from Sesame Street acted as host and consultant to the International Children's Festival.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "296136", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=296136", "title": "International Physics Olympiad", "text": "International Physics Olympiad\n\nThe International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) is an annual physics competition for high school students. It is one of the International Science Olympiads. The first IPhO was held in Warsaw, Poland in 1967.\n\nEach national delegation is made up of at most five student competitors plus two leaders, selected on a national level. Observers may also accompany a national team. The students compete as individuals, and must sit for intensive theoretical and laboratory examinations. For their efforts the students can be awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals or an honourable mention.\n\nThe theoretical examination lasts 5 hours and consists of three questions. Usually these questions involve more than one part. The practical examination may consist of one laboratory examination of five hours, or two, which together take up the full five hours.\n\nSeveral months before the first IPhO took place in 1967, invitations were sent to all the Central European countries. The invitations were accepted by Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania (five countries including Poland, the organiser of the competition). Each team consisted of three secondary school students accompanied by one supervisor. The competition was arranged along the lines of the final stage of the Polish Physics Olympiad: one day for theoretical problems and one day for carrying out an experiment. One obvious difference was that the participants had to wait for the scripts to be marked. During the waiting period the organisers arranged two excursions by plane to Kraków and to Gdańsk. At the first IPhO the students had to solve four theoretical problems and one experimental problem.\n\nThe second Olympiad was organised by Prof. Rezső Kunfalvi in Budapest, Hungary, in 1968. Eight countries took part in that competition. The German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia joined the participating countries. Again, each country was represented by three secondary school students and one supervisor. Some time before the second IPhO a preliminary version of the Statutes and the Syllabus were produced. Later these documents were officially accepted by the International Board consisting of the supervisors of the teams that participated in the competition. This took place during a special meeting organised in Brno, Czechoslovakia, several months after the second IPhO.\n\nThe third IPhO was arranged by Prof. Rostislav Kostial in Brno, Czechoslovakia, in 1969. On that occasion each team consisted of five students and two supervisors. The competition in Brno was organised according to the official Statutes accepted earlier.\n\nThe next Olympiad took place in Moscow, Soviet Union, in 1970. Each country was represented by six students and two supervisors. During that Olympiad several small changes were introduced into the Statutes.\n\nSince the fifth IPhO, held in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1971, each team has consisted of five pupils and two supervisors. In 1978 and 1980, the IPhO was not organized. This was due to the accession of the Western countries. The first western country to participate was France. At first, the few Western countries participating declined to accept the principle that the IPhO be organized every second year in a Western and Eastern bloc country. Thus the Eastern block countries declined from organising the 1978 and 1980 olympiads. From 1982 onwards, the yearly competition was resumed as there were enough participating Western countries to share the load. At present, the venue of the Olympiad is decided for years ahead. After accession into IPhO, every country must notify the others within three years about its willingness to host the IPhO. After this, the country is placed on a waiting list which as of 2006 stretches well into the 2050s. The failure to organize the IPhO on turn will lead to temporary expulsion from the IPhO. This happened to France in 1986.\n\nThe competition lasts for two days. One day is devoted to theoretical problems (three problems involving at least four areas of physics taught in secondary schools, total number of marks is 30). Another day is devoted to experimental problems (one or two problems, total number of marks 20). These two days are separated by at least one day of rest. On both occasions the time allotted for solving the problems is five hours. Each team consists of students from general or technical secondary schools (not colleges or universities) or have graduated but are yet to enter university, and must be under the age of 20. Typically each team consists of five students (pupils) and two supervisors. Smaller teams may also participate(consisting 4 or less students with 1 supervisors).\n\nThe minimal scores required for Olympiad medals and honourable mentions are chosen by the organizers according to the following rules: A gold medal should be awarded to the top 8% of the participants. A silver medal or better should be awarded to the top 25%. A bronze medal or better should be awarded to the top 50%. An honourable mention or better should be awarded to the top 67%. All other participants receive certificates of participation. The participant with the highest score (absolute winner) receives a special prize, in addition to a gold medal.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4405128", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4405128", "title": "Jacco Macacco", "text": "Jacco Macacco\n\nJacco Macacco was a fighting ape or monkey who was exhibited in monkey-baiting matches at the Westminster Pit in London in the early 1820s. He achieved some measure of fame among the sporting community through his reputed prodigious record of victories against dogs, but was brought to wider attention by depiction in popular literature, artworks and by citation in speeches to Parliament by the animal welfare campaigner Richard Martin. Jacco's most famous fight, against the equally well-known bitch Puss, seems to have marked the end of his career: he may have died as a result of injuries received during the match or of an unrelated illness sometime afterwards. His ashes are housed at the True Crime Museum in Hastings, East Sussex.\n\nMost details on Jacco come from second-hand or fictionalized accounts. In \"Pictures of Sporting Life and Character\" (1860), William Pitt Lennox gives a detailed account of Jacco's career: he was landed at Portsmouth where he fought dogs in a number of local sporting arenas before being purchased by a London sporting impresario and transported to Hoxton from where he continued his career, fighting in the Chick Lane and Tottenham Court Road pits, and earned one of his monikers as the \"Hoxton Ape\". Lennox writes that after biting his owner he was sold to the proprietor of the Westminster Pit, Charles Aistrop. Although he was already somewhat famous, at the Westminster Pit Jacco's fights began to attract spectators from the higher reaches of society and considerable wagers were placed on his fights.\nAistrop gave a somewhat different account of Jacco's history. In a statement published in 1825 he claimed that Jacco had belonged to a sailor who had kept him for three years. Jacco had always been very calm but one day suddenly became aggressive over a saucer of milk and lacerated three of the sailor's fingers. The sailor had sold him to a silversmith called Carter from Hoxton. Carter had taught Jacco many tricks, but because the ape was extremely aggressive Carter had to purchase a large sheet of iron to use as a shield whenever he approached him. Carter finally tired of Jacco's constant attempts to attack him and took the ape into a nearby field where he set a dog on him. Jacco defeated both this dog and a second dog, and was then matched against a dog bred for fighting at Bethnal Green. When he also defeated this dog, his reputation began to grow and a fight was fixed for him at the Westminster Pit. Reputable historians frequently point to this fight as the first documentable episode of exacting what later came to be referred to as \"monkey justice.\" \n\nLewis Strange Wingfield (1842–1891) wrote in his 1883 novel \"Abigail Rowe: a Chronicle of the Regency\" of an advertisement for a hundred guinea match between Jacco and \"Belcher's celebrated dog Trusty\". Pierce Egan also wrote about a battle between the \"monkey phenomenon\" and a dog in his popular account of the adventures of the characters Tom and Jerry in various sporting venues, \"Scenes from London Life\". Although Egan's account of Tom and Jerry's visit to the Westminster Pit to see the fight between Jacco and the dog is detailed and is accompanied by a fine print by George Cruikshank, it is a humorous fiction and even though it may be based on real events it is impossible to judge how accurate the record of the fight is.\n\nIt appears that there was at least one contest between Jacco and the equally renowned white Bull and Terrier bitch, Puss, who belonged to the former prizefighter Tom Cribb. The various accounts of the fight and its outcome appear contradictory: the two animals may have been matched more than once, so reports may be from different fights. Aistrop puts the date of the contest as 13 June 1821. Lennox gives the terms of the fight on which he reports as a wager of fifty pounds that Puss could either kill Jacco or last five minutes with him (almost double the length of time which any of Jacco's previous opponents had managed) and reported Jacco as the victor though he did not record the eventual fate of the dog. Thomas Landseer produced an etching from his own sketch of \"Fight between Jacko Maccacco a celebrated Monkey and Mr Tho. Cribbs well known bitch Puss\" which shows the two combatants locked together tearing at one another's throats.\n\nRichard Martin, the MP for Galway who was known as \"Humanity Dick\" for his philanthropy and constant attempts to introduce legislation improve the treatment of animals, gave an impassioned speech to Parliament in 1822 when introducing a bill to prevent the mistreatment of horses, cattle and sheep (his earlier attempt in 1821 had been defeated in the Lords). He claimed that he had seen a bill advertising a fight between Jacco and Puss:\n\nThe result, according to Martin, was that after the fight had gone on for half an hour the dog had its carotid artery severed and Jacco's jaw had been torn away causing the death of both animals within two hours. Martin's bill passed, but later his accounts of acts of animal cruelty were challenged in Parliament. Protected by Parliamentary privilege, he could not be accused of lying, but opponents managed to discredit some of his claims of acts of cruelty. Martin also revised his own account of the outcome of Jacco and Puss's match when he used the fight as an example of cruelty in an 1824 speech, claiming that the dog had been killed, but although the monkey's jaw had been torn away he had not been humanely dispatched but \"allowed to languish in torment\". Martin's version of Jacco's death was disputed by the owner of the Westminster Pit who claimed that Jacco had dealt with Puss in two and a half minutes (although he had not injured her fatally) and had died 15 months later of an unrelated illness. According to Aistrop, Jacco was then stuffed and sold to a Mr Shaw of Mitchum Common, which would have been impossible if the monkey's jaw was torn away. An account from George Charles Grantley Fitzhardinge Berkeley in \"My Life and Recollections\" also contradicted Martin's tale. Berkeley stated that he had attended the pit on the night of the match and had seen Tom Cribb cradling the dog's head in a suspicious manner before the fight began. When the dog was turned loose it immediately latched onto the monkey and gave Jacco no opportunity to fight back. Despite this the dog had appeared to be bleeding and slowly weakened. Cries from the audience eventually led to the contest being declared a draw and the two combatants were separated. Berkeley realised that Cribb had cut the dog before releasing it and this was confirmed by the unrepentant Cribb who claimed that it was for the purposes of giving the audience a good show. There is a possibility that the two animals fought twice: a extant poster from 1821 advertised a match between Jacco and a 19-pound bitch that was to take place on 27 November 1821 and referred to a match between Jacco and Puss that had already taken place.\n\nJacco was reported to weigh and was pitched against dogs of up to twice his weight. The 1821 advertising broadsheet for his match against the bitch states he was open to challenges from \"any dog in England for 100 Guineas of 24lbs being double his own weight\". According to Lennox:\nLennox writes that after several fights, Jacco adapted his technique and would overcome his canine opponents by leaping directly on their backs and manoeuvring himself into a position where he could tear at their windpipes while remaining out of reach of their jaws. Lennox reports him as having overcome fourteen opponents in total and the advertising broadsheet states he had already been involved in thirteen matches \"with some of the best dogs of the day including his combat with the wonderful bitch Puss of T. Cribbs and the famed Oxford one\". Both Berkeley and Lawrence Fitz-Barnard (writing in \"Fighting Sports\" in 1922) cast doubt on Jacco's ability to beat any canine opponent in an un-rigged match though. Berkeley points to the bleeding of the dogs by Cribb and stresses the tendency of writers to exaggerate their accounts of simian ferocity and strength, while Fitz-Barnard dismisses out-of-hand the possibility of any but the largest apes being able to prevail against a fighting dog. Fitz-Barnard claims that Jacco was a \"stock performer and put up a great battle with an indifferent dog. The monkey was given a club to assist him...\" Most accounts agree that Jacco was held in a small cage when not fighting and was secured by a short length of thin metal chain during his matches.\n\nWhich species of monkey or ape Jacco belonged to is unknown. Lennox initially describes him as coming from Africa, but later writes that he belonged to the Asian gibbon family:\nEgan describes him as the \"famed Italian monkey\", Umberto Cuomo writing in \"Il Bulldog\" in 2002 says he was probably a mandrill. Before Aistrop had acquired Jacco, he had featured a baboon at the Westminster Pit in an attempt to capitalise on Jacco's growing fame, but, according to Lennox, this had only served to emphasise Jacco's skill by comparison. Neither the Cruikshanks' aquatint nor Henry Aitken's depiction of Jacco fighting an unidentified opponent are detailed enough to identify Jacco's species, even if they are taken from life (the Cruickshanks are more interested in depicting the spectators than in the accuracy of the depiction of the monkey). Landseer's etching shows Jacco with a short tail and is annotated with \"...from a sketch made at the time by himself\", so it is liable to be the most accurate of the illustrations of Jacco. Aistrop described Jacco as \"canine mouthed and much larger than the common monkey\".\n\nThe term Macacco was in use as a general term for a monkey at the time; it came from the Portuguese \"macaco\" meaning \"monkey,\" a derivative of a Bantu word that had been exported to Brazil where it was used to describe various type of monkey in the 17th century. As different authors applied the term to different species it is difficult to know which species, genus or family was meant. Macaca was given as a name to a widespread genus of Old World monkeys (the macaques) in 1799. Jaco was the specific name for a lemur and the term \"Macauco\" was also in general use to mean lemur, but there is no suggestion that Jacco was a lemur — Lennox specifically discounts this, and credits Jacco's forename as deriving from the \"Jolly Jack Tars\" that transported him to England and first observed his fighting abilities. Jacco's fame may have been associated with the rise of a Cockney slang word for a monkey \"Murkauker\" in the middle of the 19th century (although this was already obsolete by the 1890s), and \"Jacco Macacco\" itself was at least sometimes used as a generalised term for a monkey at the same period. Aistrop claimed that the sailor that had originally owned him had taken him from the \"Isle of Maccacco\".\n\n"}
{"id": "47503006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47503006", "title": "Karam (festival)", "text": "Karam (festival)\n\nKaram is the worship of Karam-Devta (Karam-Lord/God), the god of power, youth, and youthfulness. The Karam festival is an agricultural festival celebrated by diverse groups of people, including: the Khortha, Korba , Nagpuri, Kurmali, Sambalpuri, Oraon, Munda, Kharia and Santal . The festival is held on the 11th day of a full moon (Purnima) of the Hindu month of Bhado (Bhadra), which falls between August and September. Groups of young villagers go to the jungle and collect wood, fruits, and flowers. These are required during the puja (worship) of the Karam God. During this period, people sing and dance together in groups. The entire valley dances to the drumbeat \"day of the phases\".\n\nIn the ritual, people go to the jungle accompanied by groups of drummers and cut one or more branches of the Karam tree. The branches are usually carried by unmarried, young girls who sing in praise of the deity. Then the branches are brought to the village and planted in the center of the ground which is plastered with cow-dung and decorated with flowers. A tribal priest (Jhankar or Dehuri) offers germinated grains and liquor in propitiation to the deity who grants wealth and children. A fowl is also killed and the blood is offered to the branch. The tribal priest then recites a legend to the villagers about the efficacy of Karam puja. The legend varies from tribe to tribe.\n\nThe Karam festival is celebrated usually on Bhado Ekadashi, on the eleventh day of the bright full moon (Purnima) of the month of Bhado (August–September). The Karam tree, scientifically named \"Nauclea Parvifolia\" is the center of the proceedings of the festival. The preparations for the Karam festival begin around ten or twelve days before the festival.\n\nThe morning of the Karam festival begins with women pounding rice in the dheki, a wooden implement, to obtain rice flour. This rice flour is used to make a local tribal delicacy which can be sweet as well as salty. This delicacy is cooked in the morning of the Karam festival for consumption, and shared throughout the neighborhood.\n\nThen the people begin the ritual dance with a yellow bloom tucked behind their ear. A branch of the Karam tree is carried by the Karma dancers and passed among them while they are singing and dancing. This branch is washed with milk and rice beer (locally known as hariya). Then, the branch is raised in the middle of the dancing arena. After reciting the legend - the story behind the worshiping of Karam (Nature/God/Goddess) - all the men and women drink liquor and spend the entire night singing and dancing; both are essential parts of the festival.\n\nWomen dance to the beat of drums and folk songs (\"siring\"). The Puja is followed by a community feast and the drinking of hariya. The next day, the Karam tree is sprinkled with curd of the seas and immersed in the river bed.\n\nKaram is a festival of sisterhood, friendship, and cultural unity. The festival also has a close link to nature. Tribes worship trees during this festival as they are a source of livelihood, and they pray to mother nature to keep their farmlands green and ensure a rich harvest. It is believed that the worship for good germination increases the fertility of grain crops. Karam/Karma Devta/Karam Deviis (the God of power, youth and youthfulness) is worshiped during the festival. The devotees keep a day-long fast and worship the branches of karam/kadam and sal. Girls celebrate the festival for welfare, friendship and sisterhood by exchanging a jawa flower.\n\nThere are multiple versions of the story behind the origin of Karam Puja. Anthropologist Hari Mohan writes that after the rituals are over, the karam story is narrated to boys and girls. The story behind the festival, according to Mohan, is this:\n\nOnce upon a time there were seven brothers who labored hard at agriculture work. They had no time even for lunch; therefore, their wives carried their lunches to the field daily. Once it so happened that their wives did not bring the lunches for them. They were hungry. In the evening they returned home and found that their wives were dancing and singing near a branch of the karam tree in the court yard. This made them angry, and one of the brothers lost his temper. He snatched the karam branch and threw it into the river. The karam deity was insulted; as a result, the economic condition of their family continued to deteriorate and they were brought to the point of starvation. One day a Brahman (priest) came to them, and the seven brothers told him the whole story. On hearing it, the Brahman told them that the Karam Rani was angry and she must be appeased. If it was not done their condition would further deteriorate, the Brahman told them. The seven brothers then left the village in search of the Karam Rani. They kept on moving from place to place and, one day, they found the karam tree. Subsequently, they worshiped it and their economic condition began to improve.\n\nAmong the Bhumij and the Orans the legend is that there were seven brothers living together. The six oldest used to work in the field and the youngest stayed at home. He was indulging in dance and songs round a karam tree in the courtyard with his six sisters-in-law. One day, they were so engrossed in dance and song that the brothers' morning meal was not carried to the field by the wives. When the brothers arrived home, they became agitated and threw the karam tree into a river. The youngest brother left home in anger. Then evil days fell on the remaining brothers. Their house was damaged, the crops failed, and they virtually starved. While wandering, the youngest brother found the karam tree floating in the river. Then he propitiated the god, who restored everything. Thereafter he returned home and called his brothers and told them that because they insulted Karam Devta, they fell on evil days. Since then the Karam Devta has been worshipped.\n\nAnother legend prevalent among the Pauri Bhuiyans is that a merchant returned home after a very prosperous voyage. His vessel was loaded with precious metals and other valuables which he had brought from distant lands. He waited in the vessel to be ceremoniously received by his wife and relatives, as was the custom. As it was the day of the Karama festival, all the women were engrossed with dancing and the men with playing the drums, so no one came to receive him. The merchant became furious with them. He uprooted the karam tree and threw it away. Then the wrath of Karam Devta fell on him. His vessel immediately sank in the sea. The merchant consulted astrologers who told him to propitiate Karam Devta. He launched another vessel, set out in search of the deity, and found him floating in the sea. He propitiated him with great devotion and all his wealth was restored. From that day on, the annual festival of Karam Puja has been held. After spending the whole night with dance and songs, the people uproot the branches and carry them to nearby rivers or rivulets for immersion.\n\n\n8. http://asbbs.org/files/2009/PDF/E/EkkaR.pdf Dr.DR.

Mitigation efforts created several new islands between the two towns and altered the western-side flow of the Susquehanna around these.\n\nThe River Slope Mine, an anthracite coal mine owned by the Knox Coal Company, flooded when coal company management had the miners dig illegally out under the Susquehanna River. Tunneling sharply upwards toward river bed without having drilled boreholes to gauge the rock thickness overhead, the miners came to a section with a thickness of about — was considered the minimum for safety. The insufficient \"roof\" cover caused the waters of the river to break into the mine.\n\nIt took three days to plug the hole in the riverbed, which was done by dumping large railroad cars, smaller mine cars, culm, and other debris into the whirlpool formed by the water draining into the mine.\n\nTwelve mineworkers died; 69 others escaped. Amedeo Pancotti was awarded the Carnegie Medal for climbing up the abandoned Eagle Air Shaft and alerting rescuers, which led to the safe recovery of 33 men including Pancotti himself. The bodies of the twelve who died were never recovered, despite efforts to pump the water out of the mine. The victims were Samuel Altieri, John Baloga, Benjamin Boyar, Francis Burns, Charles Featherman, Joseph Gizenski, Dominic Kaveliski, Frank Orlowski, Eugene Ostrowski, William Sinclair, Daniel Stefanides, and Herman Zelonis.\n\nThe Knox catastrophe was less deadly than the Twin Shaft disaster in Pittston in 1896, which claimed 58 lives.\n\nEventually, an estimated of water filled the mines. \n\nTen people were indicted in the disaster's aftermath, including the mine superintendent, Robert Dougherty; owner Louis Fabrizio; secret owner August J. Lippi, who was also the president of District 1 of the United Mine Workers; and three union officials. Six served jail time.\n\nJanuary 22, 2009, marked the fiftieth anniversary of the Knox Mine Disaster, with an annual memorial mass at St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church in Pittston, Pennsylvania, and a ceremony held at the former St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Port Griffith, which is the site of a commemorative monument and a State Historic Marker erected in 1999 by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission. The church was closed in May 2008 owing to a consolidation of area parishes and put up for sale in July 2008. The property was purchased on January 15, 2009, exactly one week prior to the fiftieth anniversary, by Susan Baloga and John Baloga, the grandson of John Baloga, one of the twelve miners who perished in the event. The property is now the site of Baloga Funeral Home. The fiftieth anniversary also included a special program at the Anthracite Heritage Museum in Scranton, which organized an annual program on the disaster in January.\n\n"}

Muktsar, originally called Khidrana, was named as Muktsar (\"the pool of liberation\") following the battle. These forty Sikhs, led by their leader Mahan Singh, had formally deserted Sri Guru Gobind Singh in the need of hour, and signed a written memorandum to the effect. When Mai Bhago, a valiant and upright lady, heard of this cowardly act, she scolded the Singh's and inspired them refresh with spirit of bravery for which Sikhs are known. Hence, the unit went back and joined the Guru who was already engaged in action at Khidrana. All forty of them attained martyrdom. The memorandum (\"bedawa\") was torn-down by the Guru himself just before Mahan Singh died.\n\nPeople gather from all over Punjab, even other parts of India to join the festival which is in fact spread over many days. Merchants display their wares for sale, which include from trinkets to high-end electronics, the weapons Nihangs bear and especially agricultural machinery (since most around are farmers). The country's biggest circuses, Apollo and Gemini, are there as a matter of rule, merry-go-rounds and giant wheels, and the famous Well of Death (trick motorcycling inside consortium of wood planks) are the special attraction for children.\n\nWhile kids enjoy the rides, there are tuck shops that are quite a find. Women buy crockery and home decor, men mostly interest in special (name embedded on rice grain) keyrings, posters. Kids have special corner for toys and other things. The shops sell out goggles, kitchen utensils, makeup, shoes and clothes, all in average quality and lowest market possible cost. You don't need big bucks to shop a lot. However, very limited use of electronic payments is done, as the end merchant is a poor villager, hardly touched by digital world.\n\nIt is also a very important occasion from the political point of view, as all the significant politicos, including the chief minister are there on the main day. All major political leaders/ parties hold separate stages to throw political dirt at one another. Such arrangement needs extremely tight police -up which is met by calling out forces, sometimes even CRPF and BSF battalions from neighboring areas.\n"}

Drake Bell, Josh Peck, Miranda Cosgrove, Nancy Sullivan, and Jonathan Goldstein reappear as their respective characters, with several recurring characters from the TV series also reappearing. The film was shot in July 2008.\n\nThe film premiered on December 5, 2008, as a Nickelodeon Original Movie. It was the third most viewed TV movie on cable behind \"High School Musical 2\" and \"\", both owned by Disney Channel.\n\nThe film premiered 15 months after the end of the original \"Drake & Josh\" series in September 2007.\n\nShortly before Christmas, Walter (Jonathan Goldstein) and Audrey (Nancy Sullivan) decide to leave home for a tropical vacation. Their children Drake (Drake Bell) and Megan (Miranda Cosgrove) come home while Josh (Josh Peck) shows them his snowman air balloon decoration, which Megan sabotages. Later at the mall, Drake tells Josh that he will be throwing a Christmas party on the roof of his workplace the Premiere, which Josh is unsure of, but Helen (Yvette Nicole Brown) approves. Helen then hands Drake a Santa costume to wear in the mall. While hiding from a woman looking to kiss him, Drake meets a little girl named Mary Alice (Bailee Madison) who says she and her family want the best Christmas ever. He makes an unbreakable promise that he will make it so.\n\nAt the party, Josh's co-worker Crazy Steve (Jerry Trainor) shows the two pictures of his favoured wood chipper \"Sally\". Craig (Alec Medlock) and Eric (Scott Halberstadt) suggest to Drake that he perform a song in the upcoming Christmas parade, but Drake explains that he will be in Las Vegas at a concert. Later on, some party crashers show up whom Josh calls the police on, but he falls off the roof after they arrive during a mix-up, landing in the back of a pickup truck with the police trailing close behind, eventually rolling out only to be arrested. In jail, he meets his cellmate, Bludge (Kimbo Slice). At first, Bludge tries to beat him up until Josh entertains him with magic tricks.\n\nKnowing he must fulfill his promise after Mary Alice tells him about her sick foster mom and busy foster dad, Drake attempts to break Josh out to help him, only to get caught and arrested. Drake and Josh are sent to court, with Helen acting as their lawyer. She informs Judge Newman (Henry Winkler) of Drake's promise to Mary Alice, who decides that they will not be sent to jail as long as they fulfill it. Afterwards, they meet their cruel and embittered parole officer Perry Gilbert (David Pressman), who says that he will hold a vote with Mary Alice's family asking if they had the best Christmas ever. If any of them say \"no\", they will go to jail. The duo soon meet Mary Alice's foster family, which include frequently feuding twins Lily and Violet (Camille and Cosette Goldstein), Zigfee (David Gore), a foreign boy who speaks an unknown language, know-it-all Trey (Daven Wilson), and Mary Alice's rebellious, loner older brother Luke (Devon Graye). They find many possibilities to give the family the best Christmas ever, but their attempts are foiled by Officer Gilbert. Drake and Josh enlist Megan's help to sabotage Officer Gilbert's doings by bribing her with Trevor's rare Smith Royal oboe; however, she stops upon discovering it was an empty bribe.\n\nJosh then visits Officer Gilbert's mother, who explains that as a child, Officer Gilbert always wanted a pet chimpanzee for Christmas. When he found one sitting in a cage by the tree and opened the cage door, it attacked him, causing him to hate Christmas ever since. Drake and Josh realize that since Christmas was ruined for him, he wants to ruin it for everyone else.\n\nDrake and Josh eventually decide to take Mary Alice's family caroling; however, nobody in their neighborhood listens to them. The group decides to put on a concert, performing a rock rendition of 12 Days of Christmas, which the entire family, even Luke, loves so much they decide to perform it in the Christmas parade. At the parade, Officer Gilbert tricks Crazy Steve into loudly reminding the duo in front of Mary Alice that they will go to prison if they do not keep their promise. Believing they were only being nice to avoid punishment, Mary Alice and her family leave. Despite the family's anger towards them, Drake and Josh are determined to keep their promise. Meanwhile, they also send Officer Gilbert a nice chimpanzee as a Christmas present, which causes him to begin loving Christmas again. They then borrow Steve's wood chipper to make it snow in front of Mary Alice's house by putting ice in the machine, but it inadvertently shoots large chunks towards the house. After the machine knocks both brothers unconscious, Officer Gilbert brings them home.\n\nThe brothers enter the living room the next morning, where Mary Alice's family surprises them, having learned from Officer Gilbert that the two were not actually using them to stay out of prison. The vote is held, with everyone voting \"yes\". Bludge, dressed as Santa, then comes down the chimney to deliver gifts to everyone, including a Smith Royal oboe for Megan. Josh's girlfriend Mindy, who had left town for the holidays, arrives too after hearing about everything that happened, and Steve gets \"Sally\" to make snow by using 7,000 pounds of hard cheese. Drake and Josh's parents then arrive home from their troubled vacation at their \"bungalow\", which was blown away earlier in a tropical storm. As everyone plays in the blanket of \"snow\", they truly have the best Christmas ever.\n\nThe show's vast majority of recurring characters returned for the special, all played by their original actors. Crazy Steve takes a more major role in this film, having a larger role in the film than Audrey or Walter.\nThese characters all have a larger role than most characters, second only to Drake, Josh, and Megan.\nThe opening theme for the movie entitled \"Christmas Promise\" was composed and performed by Drake & Josh series composer Backhouse Mike. Miranda Cosgrove did a cover of \"Christmas Wrapping\", and the song became the single of the movie, but no soundtrack was released. The cast featuring Drake Bell, Josh Peck, and the kids do a cover of \"12 Days of Christmas\" in the movie. Drake Bell made a music video for his cover of \"Jingle Bells\" which promoted the movie and can be seen on the DVD.\n\nThe premiere of \"Merry Christmas, Drake & Josh\" had 8.095 million viewers.\n\n"}

It was discovered by the French astronomer Charles Messier in 1764, who described it as a circular nebula without a star. In the New General Catalogue, compiled during the 1880s, it was described as a \"remarkable globular, bright, large, slightly oval.\" This cluster can be easily viewed with a pair of 10×50 binoculars, forming a patch of hazy light some 4 arcminutes wide that is slightly elongated along the east–west axis. With a larger instrument, individual stars can be resolved and the cluster will cover an angle of up to 12 arcminutes across with a compressed core one arcminute wide. It is best observed around August.\n\nM30 is located at a distance of about 27,100 light-years from Earth, and is about 93 light-years across. The estimated age is roughly 12.93 billion years and it has a combined mass of about 160,000 times the mass of the Sun. The cluster is following a retrograde orbit through the inner galactic halo, suggesting that it was acquired from a satellite galaxy rather than forming within the Milky Way. It is currently located at a distance of about from the center of the galaxy, compared to an estimated for the Sun.\n\nThe M30 cluster has passed through a dynamic process called core collapse and now has a concentration of mass at its core of about a million times the Sun's mass per cubic parsec. This makes it one of the highest density regions in the Milky Way galaxy. Stars in such close proximity will experience a high rate of interactions that can create binary star systems, as well as a type of star called a blue straggler that is formed by mass transfer. A process of mass segregation may have caused the central region to gain a greater proportion of higher mass stars, creating a color gradient with increasing blueness toward the middle of the cluster.\n\n"}

Each festival includes a wide variety of narrative films, documentaries, and animations submitted by independent filmmakers from all parts of the world.\n\nAll filmmakers are invited to submit entries for consideration. Each film selected for the festival is awarded the distinctive Shoestring Trophy. The festival offers appreciative, movie-wise audiences to view accepted films at the Dryden Theatre, George Eastman House International Museum of Film and Photography in Rochester, NY.\n\nMovies on a Shoestring Inc. was founded in 1959 by a group of Rochester-area movie enthusiasts to provide a venue for independent filmmakers to present their cinematic creations. The name was a double entendre: most amateur filmmakers shot on 8 mm back then, and the narrowness of the stock led it to call it \"the shoestring gauge.\"\n\nThe first public exhibition at the Rochester Public Library. It consisted of 16 films made by people from the Rochester area. During the second year a film from Toronto, Ontario, Canada was included, and in a modest sense Movies on a Shoestring became an international festival. That was also the year the show moved to the Dryden Theatre through the courtesy of George Eastman House. Three hundred people attended the performance.\n\n1964 was their first truly international year. The festival received films from all over the United States as well as five foreign countries. This international activity prompted them in 1965 to identify their shows as the Rochester International Movie Film Festival and to become a charter member of the International Association of Amateur Film Festivals, a worldwide organization dedicated to establishing standards and consistency among festivals of this type.\n\nBy 1971 Movies on a Shoestring had firmly established itself among the world's leading amateur festivals, so they modified their name to the Rochester International Amateur Film Festival. In 1983 they accepted their first video entries. The worldwide growth of film schools and of the film industry in general has led to a great increase in the number of professional quality short films being produced and competing for spots in the festival, so in 1996 they dropped the word \"amateur\" from our name and became The Rochester International Film Festival.\n\nTo provide independent filmmakers even greater public exposure, beginning in 1972, selected films from each year's festival, based on audience surveys taken at each show, have been assembled into a collection called The Best of the Fest. It has been made possible to borrow films from the collection, free of charge, by organizations around the state.\n\nThe festival is screened at the George Eastman House's Dryden Theatre each spring usually in April.\n\nThe festival is associated with \"Movies on a Shoestring, Inc.\" - an independent non-profit organization. The \"Rochester International Film Festival\" is a member of the \"Arts & Cultural Council for Greater Rochester\".\n\nFor one year, in 2008, the festival merged with the High Falls Film Festival to become the Rochester-High Falls International Film Festival. The two festivals have since separated, although the High Falls Film Festival changed their name in 2010 to become the 360 365 Film Festival.\n\n"}
{"id": "761899", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=761899", "title": "Sayings of Jesus on the cross", "text": "Sayings of Jesus on the cross\n\nThe Sayings of Jesus on the cross (also called the Seven Last Words from the Cross) are seven expressions biblically attributed to Jesus during his crucifixion. Traditionally, the brief sayings have been called \"words\". They are gathered from the four Canonical Gospels. Three of the sayings appear only in the Gospel of Luke and three only in the Gospel of John. The other saying appears both in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Mark. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus cries out to God. In Luke, he forgives his killers, reassures the penitent thief, and commends his spirit to the Father. In John, he speaks to his mother, says he thirsts, and declares the end of his earthly life.\n\nA person's final articulated words said prior to death or as death approaches generally are taken to have particular significance. These seven sayings, being \"last words\", may provide a way to understand what was ultimately important to this man who was dying on the cross. The sparsity of sayings recorded in the biblical accounts suggests that Jesus remained relatively silent for the hours he hung there.\n\nSince the 16th century they have been widely used in sermons on Good Friday, and entire books have been written on theological analysis of them. The Seven Last Words from the Cross are an integral part of the liturgy in the Anglican, Catholic, Protestant, and other Christian traditions.\n\nThe seven-sayings tradition is an example of the Christian approach to the construction of a Gospel harmony in which material from different Gospels is combined, producing an account that goes beyond each Gospel. Several composers have set the Seven Last Words to music.\n\nThe seven sayings form part of a Christian meditation that is often used during Lent, Holy Week and Good Friday. The traditional order of the sayings is:\n\n\nTraditionally, these seven sayings are called words of 1. \"Forgiveness\", 2. \"Salvation\", 3. \"Relationship\", 4. \"Abandonment\", 5. \"Distress\", 6. \"Triumph\" and 7. \"Reunion\".\n\nAs can be seen from the above list, not all seven sayings can be found in any one account of Jesus' crucifixion. The ordering is a harmonisation of the texts from each of the four canonical gospels. In the gospels of Matthew and Mark, Jesus is quoted in Aramaic, shouting the \"fourth\" phrase.. In Luke's Gospel, the first, second, and seventh sayings occur. The third, fifth and sixth sayings can only be found in John's Gospel. In other words:\n\nThis first saying of Jesus on the cross is traditionally called \"The Word of Forgiveness\". It is theologically interpreted as Jesus' prayer for forgiveness for the Roman soldiers who were crucifying him and all others who were involved in his crucifixion.\n\nSome early manuscripts do not include this sentence in Luke 23:34.\n\nThis saying is traditionally called \"The Word of Salvation\". According to Luke's Gospel, Jesus was crucified between two thieves (traditionally named Dismas and Gestas), one of whom supports Jesus' innocence and asks him to remember him when he comes into his kingdom. Jesus replies, \"Truly, I say to you...\" (, \"amēn legō soi\"), followed with the only appearance of the word \"Paradise\" in the Gospels (, \"paradeisō\", from the Persian \"pairidaeza\" \"paradise garden\").\n\nA seemingly simple change in punctuation in this saying has been the subject of doctrinal differences among Christian groups, given the lack of punctuation in the original Greek texts. Catholics and most Protestant Christians usually use a version which reads \"today you will be with me in Paradise\". This reading assumes a direct voyage to Heaven and has no implications of purgatory. On the other hand, some Protestants who believe in soul sleep have used a reading which emphasizes \"I say to you today\", leaving open the possibility that the statement was made today, but arrival in Heaven may be later.\n\nThis statement is traditionally called \"The Word of Relationship\" and in it Jesus entrusts Mary, his mother, into the care of \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".\n\nMethodist minister Adam Hamilton's 2009 interpretation: \"Jesus looked down from the cross to see his mother standing nearby. As far as we know, only one of the twelve apostles was there at the foot of the cross: \"the disciple whom Jesus loved,\" usually identified as John. Naked and in horrible pain, he thought not of himself but was concerned for the well-being of his mother after his death. This shows Jesus' humanity and the depth of love he had for his mother and the disciple into whose care he entrusted her.\"\n\nIt is the only saying that appears in more than one Gospel, and is a quote from . This saying is taken by some as an abandonment of the Son by the Father. Other theologians understand the cry as that of one who was truly human and who felt forsaken. Put to death by his foes, very largely deserted by his friends, he may have felt also deserted by God.\n\nOthers point to this as the first words of Psalm 22 and suggest that Jesus recited these words, perhaps even the whole psalm, \"that he might show himself to be the very Being to whom the words refer; so that the Jewish scribes and people might examine and see the cause why he would not descend from the cross; namely, because this very psalm showed that it was prophetized that He would suffer these things.\"\n\nTheologian Frank Stagg points to what he calls \"a mystery of Jesus' incarnation: \"...he who died at Golgotha (Calvary) is one with the Father, that God was in Christ, and that at the same time he cried out to the Father\".\n\nIn Aramaic, the phrase was/is rendered, \"אלי אלי למה שבקתני\".\n\nWhile \"the nails in the wrists are putting pressure on the large median nerve, and the severely damaged nerve causes excruciating pain\", the Lamb of God experiences the abandonment of the soul by God, a deeply excruciating pain that \"is the essence of eternal condemnation in Hell\". Demonic powers were given the transitory power to physically and psychically torment the Son of God and eventually to kill Him, and like in the Lord's Prayer He asks God the Father to deliver away the evil one – the devil.\n\nThis statement is traditionally called \"The Word of Distress\" and is compared and contrasted with the encounter of Jesus with the Samaritan Woman at the Well in .\n\nAs in the other accounts, the Gospel of John says Jesus was offered a drink of sour wine, adding that this person placed a sponge dipped in wine on a hyssop branch and held it to Jesus' lips. Hyssop branches had figured significantly in the Old Testament and in the Book of Hebrews.\n\nThis statement of Jesus is interpreted by John as fulfilment of the prophecy given in (cf. ), hence the quotation from John's Gospel includes the comment \"to fulfill the scriptures\".\n\nThis statement is traditionally called \"The Word of Triumph\" and is theologically interpreted as the announcement of the end of the earthly life of Jesus, in anticipation for the Resurrection.\n\nAdam Hamilton writes: \"These last words are seen as a cry of victory, not of dereliction. Jesus had now completed what he came to do. A plan was fulfilled; a salvation was made possible; a love shown. He had taken our place. He had demonstrated both humanity's brokenness and God's love. He had offered himself fully to God as a sacrifice on behalf of humanity. As he died, it was finished. With these words, the noblest person who ever walked the face of this planet, God in the flesh, breathed his last.\"\n\nThe verse has also been translated as \"It is consummated.\"\n\nFrom , this saying, which is an announcement and not a request, is traditionally called \"The Word of Reunion\" and is theologically interpreted as the proclamation of Jesus joining God the Father in Heaven.\n\nHamilton has written that \"When darkness seem to prevail in life, it takes faith even to talk to God, even if it is to complain to him. These last words of Jesus from the cross show his absolute trust in God: 'Father, into your hands I commend my spirit'. This has been termed a model of prayer for everyone when afraid, sick, or facing one's own death. It says in effect:\"\nThe last words of Jesus have been the subject of a wide range of Christian teachings and sermons, and a number of authors have written books specifically devoted to the last sayings of Christ.\n\nPriest and author Timothy Radcliffe states that in the Bible, seven is the number of perfection, and he views the seven last words as God's completion of the circle of creation and performs analysis of the structure of the seven last words to obtain further insight.\n\nThe saying \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me\" is generally given in transliterated Aramaic with a translation (originally in Greek) after it. This phrase is the opening line of , a psalm about persecution, the mercy and salvation of God. It was common for people at this time to reference songs by quoting their first lines. In the verses immediately following this saying, in both Gospels, the onlookers who hear Jesus' cry understand him to be calling for help from Elijah (Eliyyâ). The slight differences between the two gospel accounts are most probably due to dialect. Matthew's version seems to have been more influenced by Hebrew, whereas Mark's is perhaps more colloquial.\n\nThe phrase could be either:\n\nThe Aramaic word šabaqtanî is based on the verb šabaq, 'to allow, to permit, to forgive, and to forsake', with the perfect tense ending -t (2nd person singular: 'you'), and the object suffix -anî (1st person singular: 'me').\n\nA. T. Robertson noted that the \"so-called Gospel of Peter 1.5 preserves this saying in a Docetic (Cerinthian) form: 'My power, my power, thou hast forsaken me!\n\nJames Dunn considers the seven sayings weakly rooted in tradition and sees them as a part of the elaborations in the diverse retellings of Jesus' final hours. Dunn, however, argues in favour of the authenticity of the Mark/Matthew saying in that by presenting Jesus as seeing himself 'forsaken' it would have been an embarrassment to the early Church, and hence would not have been invented. Geza Vermes, states that the first saying from (Matthew and Mark) is a quotation from Psalm 22, and is therefore occasionally seen as a theological and literary device employed by the writers. According to Vermes, attempts to interpret the expression as a hopeful reference to scripture provide indirect evidence of its authenticity. Leslie Houlden, on the other hand, states that Luke may have deliberately excluded the Matthew/Mark saying from his Gospel because it did not fit in the model of Jesus he was presenting.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "9142905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9142905", "title": "Sensation (event)", "text": "Sensation (event)\n\nSensation is an indoor electronic dance music event which originated in Amsterdam, Netherlands and organized by ID&T. The original event, which ran exclusively in the Amsterdam Arena for a period of five years until 2005, is now located throughout Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Denmark, Germany, South Korea, Romania, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, India and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2000 and 2001, it was made up of one edition, just called Sensation, but it has now been split up into two editions: Sensation Black and Sensation White. This was done to differentiate the music and feeling more than would have been possible if it were one event. Sensation Black focuses more on 'darker' music, like Hardstyle and Hardcore, whereas Sensation White focuses more on trance music. Every year, Sensation also releases two doublediscs (Black and White) and two singles they call the Anthem. 2008 the names of both events have been changed: \"Sensation\" (formerly \"Sensation White\"), and \"Black\" (formerly \"Sensation Black\").\n\nThe first edition of Sensation, in 2000, did not sell out. The media announced that it was sold out in order to boost interest in the event, which eventually attracted 20,000 people. In this first edition, the DJs only used one side of the Amsterdam Arena as the stage. Later editions have the stage in the middle. This Sensation was the only one that did not have a dress code. All subsequent editions of Sensation White have sold out, usually well in advance (usually all 45,000 tickets are sold in a few hours). Sensation Black has not been as successful, but is usually either close to selling out, or sold out a few days before the event.\n\nIn 2005, Sensation White was also held in Belgium and Germany. In 2006, ID&T started Sensation International, an international tour, based on the simplified version which could be seen in the Amsterdam ArenA, in 2005. The first edition was held in the Antwerp Sportpaleis. In 2008 Sensation White was held at SCC Peterburgsky in Saint Petersburg, and a New Year version was held at the Telstra Dome in Melbourne on the 31 December 2008 (38,380 attendance). Sensation White's new anthem put place in 2014 is \"Tremor\" by Martin Garrix, and Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Sensation White's official slogan is \"Be part of the night, dress in white\".\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that July's event was to be the last Sensation to take place in Amsterdam, with all future editions to be held outside of Holland. Titled 'The Final', the last Amsterdam event took place on Saturday the 8th of July (breaking with the tradition of always taking place on the first Saturday of July) and attracted a sold-out capacity crowd of over 50,000 party people. At the time of writing (July 2017) it's not clear how much longer the Sensation brand will continue outside of Holland, but there are parties booked toward the end of 2017 in Australia, Jakarta and Dubai.\n\nSensation White used to be a trance event, but in later years it has become a pure house event. All the attendees are required to wear white and the Amsterdam ArenA itself is decorated to match. Sensation White's slogan is \"Be Part Of The Night - Dress in White\". Every event has around 40,000-45,000 tickets available. The Amsterdam ArenA event takes place every year on the first Saturday in July while the German event in the LTU Arena in Düsseldorf is held on New Year's Eve. In 2009 it was organized for the first time on two subsequent nights on 3 and 4 July in the Amsterdam Arena where the opening of the Wicked Wonderland took place.\n\nNotable DJs that have appeared at Sensation include Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Swedish House Mafia, Hardwell, Martin Garrix, Nicky Romero, Afrojack, André Tanneberger, Darren Emerson (one of the Underworld members), David Guetta, NERVO, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, Erick E, Erick Morillo, Ferry Corsten, Marco V, Paul van Dyk, Sven Väth, Johan Gielen, Sander Kleinenberg, Steve Angello, Fedde Le Grand, Sebastian Ingrosso, Sander van Doorn, Mason, Felix Da Housecat, Chuckie, Laidback Luke, Tocadisco, Rank 1, DJ Jean, Judge Jules, Carl Cox, Martin Solveig and Dada Life.\n\nThe event has recently been criticized by trance fans who think there is too much house and electro and too few trance DJs in the recent events. However, in the eyes of the organizers, the popularity of trance has been receding in the past few years, and therefore Sensation White has adapted to this by altering its programming to add house and electro house. Nonetheless, the popularity of trance and indeed the DJs associated with the genre still seem to be a major force in Europe. Trance Energy, with over 30,000 people, has been selling out faster than ever before. In the 2008 edition of Sensation, there was only one trance DJ present in the line-up: Marco V. In 2009, trance was left out completely in favor of house (classics) and techno, however the music of the 2009 Amsterdam event turned out to be more trance like again.\n\nIn 2010, Sensation, to enforce the notion that they are now a House event, came up with the theme \"Celebrate Life with House\". It featured performances by Chuckie, Swedish House Mafia, Sunnery James and Ryan Marciano, and Joris Voorn & 2000 And One. The event became exclusively a party for house music. This change in genre caused that for the first time since 2000, the tickets did not sell out the same day they went on sale, as audiences are much more demanding. In the end, about 35,000 people attended the festival held 3 July. To create interest in the now House event, Sensation came up with a contest where the fans, via the social networks, would vote for their favorite theme and make it the anthem for 2010. The competing songs, featuring a selection of house and minimal themes, were not well received by Sensation followers and the competition was eventually cancelled. During the main event in Amsterdam, Sensation decided to go back to its origins, by playing their trademark anthem \"Superstring\", reminding its fans that although it is now a House event, it stays true to its origins as promulgated by Ron Manager and the Three Musketeers.\n\nBLACK slowly builds up the pace, starting from hard trance, hardstyle and then hardcore. Sensation Black is always held in the second weekend of July. All attendees are required to dress completely in black.\n\nNotable DJs that have appeared at Sensation Black include Showtek, Angerfist, Headhunterz, Marcel Woods, Chris Liebing, DJ Lady Dana, DJ Luna, DJ Zany, The Prophet, Technoboy, Tommyknocker, Yoji Biomehanika and Mauro Picotto.\n\nAn incident occurred at Sensation Black in 2006, where DJ Rob Gee and his live band Ampt performed at the event against the recommendations of the majority of ID&T's staff, and were subsequently booed and catcalled during the performance, which was more rock/metal oriented. Slight mayhem ensued as a member of the audience climbed onto the stage and hit Rob Gee himself and was then repeatedly kicked and punched in the head by Rob and his band. The rest of Rob Gee's performance was cancelled and ID&T's manager, Duncan Stutterheim, later acknowledged his mistake in allowing Rob Gee to perform against the wishes of his employees.\n\nThe 2009 edition of BLACK was not held in the Netherlands, but only in Belgium because ID&T is looking for a better location.\nAdditionally Sensation (formerly known as \"Sensation White\") was held on two subsequent nights in the Amsterdam ArenA in 2009, but will be sharing one of the two available night licences for the Amsterdam ArenA in 2010 with the one time replacement of BLACK called the \"Feestfabriek\" from ID&T's sister organisation Q-dance.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Slumdance showed seven features and two shorts. Besides two screening rooms, there was a Build Your Own Festival option that used videocassettes and VCRs. Slumdance was set up like a slum, and had a mission area that served free soup, a \"Tent City\" which was decorated like hobo housing. The converted Slumdance space was 6000 square feet in total. A total of 150 submissions were entered by opening night, and made a press release that stated \"Slumdance Stuns Movie World by Existing\".\n\nThe event garnered some media attention, and the parties attracted celebrities including Tim Robbins. A brief interview followed on the Sundance Channel and included what the \"Deseret News\" called \"uncomfortable comments\" directed at Sundance mogul Robert Redford. An internet based site calling itself the \"Slumdance Historical Preservation Society\" confirmed that Slumdance would not occur the following year. An online-only festival was held in 2000.\n"}
{"id": "32845879", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32845879", "title": "Thanatosensitivity", "text": "Thanatosensitivity\n\nThanatosensitivity describes an epistemological-methodological approach into technological research and design that actively seeks to integrate the facts of mortality, dying, and death into traditional user-centered design. First coined by Michael Massimi and Andrea Charise from the University of Toronto in a joint paper presented at CHI 2009, \"thanatosensitivity\" refers to a humanistically grounded approach to human–computer interaction (HCI) research and design that recognizes and engages with the conceptual and practical issues surrounding death in the creation of interactive systems.\n\nThe term thanatosensitive is derived from the ancient Greek mythological personification of death, Thanatos (Greek: Θάνατος (Thánatos), \"Death\"), which is itself a term associated with the notion of the death drive common to 20th-century post-Freudian thought. This inter- or multi-disciplinarity is crucial to thanatosensitive investigation because, unlike many areas of HCI research, studies of death and mortality are rarely amenable to laboratory study or traditional fieldwork approaches. As Massimi and Charise argue, the critical humanist aspect of thanatosensitivity effectively offers \"a non-invasive strategy for better understanding the conceptual and practical issues surrounding death, computing, and human experience\".\n\nHistorically, design and research in the computer sciences has rarely considered the issues pursuant to the death of the user. However, Lindley et al. note, \"[s]hifts in the field of HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) coupled with the growing maturity of interactive technologies is leading researchers and designers to consider issues relating to mortality.\" The proliferation of digitally mediated (and often password-protected) personal data and online identities, as well as biometrical practices, \"routinely assume a living body for access\", which makes access to data following death increasingly problematic for individuals and relatives, as well as institutions and corporations, that may have claims to or stakes in such materials. A 2004 news story describes how Yahoo! denied the family of Justin Ellsworth, a deceased US marine, access to his email, preventing them from accessing information necessary for handling the aftermath of the account owner's death. Determining how digital information and artefacts \"can be bequeathed, inherited, and appropriately repurposed\" while accounting for the complexity of privacy concerns presents a new horizon of human-computer interaction research. \"At a fundamental level, such issues are becoming increasingly prominent as technology companies decide how to handle email accounts or webpages belonging to people who are now deceased.\" Recent scholarship in this area has called for the development of more purposive applications for facilitating the inheritance of digital materials.\n\nMoreover, the ways in which people use technology in practices concerning mortality, dying, and death are areas of HCI research that have historically received little attention. Although technological artefacts that address issues of the end of life are increasingly common (e.g. online memorials), academic research in this area is at an early stage. Such \"thanatechnologies\" seek to meet numerous needs, including memorialisation, bereavement support and communication, archiving, access to information and resources, and so on. While many thanatechnologies exist, relatively few are the product of a thanatosensitive design process; rather, they are appropriations of general purpose technologies. For example, forum management software is not explicitly concerned with the mortality of its users; however, online forums are a common place for the bereaved to communicate regarding loss in the form of formal and (more commonly) informal online memorials. Additionally, 3D virtual worlds are beginning to be explored as spaces for informal memorialization.\n\n"}

The show is run in Hollywood, with satellite choreographer’s balls in Chicago, New York, Sydney, London, and Tokyo.\n\nThe show is considered the dance community's ultimate competitive venue for choreographers to perform or display their work.\n\nThe show was created by Los Angeles choreographers' Carey Ysais and Paulette Azizian in 1998 to give working choreographers and dancers a venue where they could have free artistic expression without the constraints of an artist, a director, or a script. Ysais modeled the show after a similar choreographer showcase that had run at Prince's Glam Slam nightclub in Los Angeles in the 1990s.\n\nIn order to be on the show, choreographers have to submit video tapes of their work in advance and/or audition, with established and elite choreographers given free access.\n\nPerformances include street dance, popping, funk, hip hop, tap dancing, modern, ballet, lyrical dance, spoken word, and performance art. Each show has up to 14 choreographers and/or their dancers who are given up to \"five minutes of freedom\" to work artistically and perform before their peers.\n\nEach performance (i.e., \"piece\") in the show is similar to a mini-musical, with an overall theme, props, costumes, and dance styles. Virtually any kind of dance music might be played or various music styles combined. However, many pieces are known for being edgy and provocative.\n\nSome choreographers use the show for dance experimentation.\n\nThe first show of the year is usually an anniversary show, the latest 'The Carnival: Choreographer's Ball 14th Anniversary Show,\" where the dance community celebrates the year in review. Choreographer awards and/or tributes are presented to their peers, or a person or group is recognized for outstanding achievement in the field of dance or choreography, including Lifetime Achievement Awards.\n\nTalent agents for movie, music, and television productions regularly attend The Carnival: Choreographer's Ball shows searching for talent.

Founded in 1999, TromaDance was originally held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, operating concurrently alongside the Sundance Film Festival in order to showcase an independent alternative to Sundance's perceived mainstream offerings. Between 2010 and 2013, the festival had been relocated to various locations throughout New Jersey. Since 2014, TromaDance has relocated to New York City.\n\nTromaDance advertises itself as \"the first and only film festival of the people, for the people, and by the people\", dedicated to \"bringing independent art back to the people\". In direct opposition to Sundance, TromaDance doesn't charge an entry fee for filmmakers to submit their films and doesn't charge admission fees for people to attend the film screenings. Although Troma themselves are notorious for their violent low-budget horror films, TromaDance showcases both shorts and features of varying genres and formats, including comedy, drama, documentary, animation and experimental film, though horror, fantasy and sci-fi usually make up a significant portion of the entries.\n\nTromaDance is primarily funded by donations, and the festival's employees and volunteers are entirely unpaid. TromaDance has been sponsored over the years by \"Filmmaker Magazine\", G4, Jägermeister, Kodak, \"MovieMaker Magazine\", PETA, \"Rue Morgue Magazine\", \"SLUG Magazine\", and Stella Artois. Troma also sponsors fan-organized events called TromaPaloozas, music festivals that serve as fundraisers for TromaDance. TromaPaloozas have been held in Denver, Las Vegas, Minneapolis, Murfreesboro, and Tulsa.\n\nThe idea for TromaDance was developed by Troma president Lloyd Kaufman, who got the idea from \"South Park\" co-creator Trey Parker (whose debut film, \"Cannibal! The Musical\", was distributed by Troma). Feeling that Sundance had become too \"Hollywood\" by charging high entry fees, showing multimillion-dollar \"independent\" movies and practicing an elitist structure and film selection process, Parker urged Kaufman to create his own film festival that was the direct independent opposite of Sundance, one that was completely free and focused on independently produced film that was made without the Hollywood system in order to give first-time filmmakers a chance at getting their work seen.\n\nTroma has released five volumes of \"The Best of TromaDance\", DVDs of selected shorts each from two years worth of the festival. The press conference for the 2005 festival held in October 2004 featured the introduction of the official TromaDance Theme Song by longtime Troma character Count Smokula.\n\n\n"}

It contains 2,300 graves and is the only United Nations cemetery in the world. Laid out over , the graves are set out in 22 sites designated by the nationalities of the buried servicemembers.\n\nThe Korean War began when North Korean People's Army forces attacked south in June 1950. As the fighting progressed, temporary military cemeteries for battle casualties were established by United Nations forces near the towns of Taejon (July 9, 1950), Kwan-ui (Kwan-ni), Kum-chon, and Sindong. When the North Korean forces pushed towards Pusan, these cemeteries had to be abandoned. Later, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter developed, temporary cemeteries were established at Masan, Miryang, and Taegu, with a Pusan cemetery being established on July 11, 1950. As the fighting pushed into North Korea, temporary cemeteries were established in or near the towns of Kaesong, Sukehon, Wonsan, Pupchong (Pukchong County), Yudarn-ni and Koto-ri. Some 11 division-level cemeteries were established in the first two months of fighting and later 5 UN military cemeteries were established in North Korea.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, the nearest U.S. Army mortuary affairs unit was the 108th Graves Registration Platoon in Yokohama, Japan, which was searching for the remains of missing World War II American airmen. The 108th was reconfigured as the 114th Graves Registration Company and deployed to establish temporary cemeteries at Hungnam, Pyongyang, and Suchon as the fighting continued. Supporting the 2nd Infantry Division was the Graves Registration Section of the 2nd Quartermaster Company, which collected the remains of Allied and American soldiers to be further processed by the 148th Graves Registration Company. When UN forces launched the Inchon Invasion in September 1950, a platoon from the 565th Graves Registration Company accompanied them. Other mortuary affairs units included the 293rd Graves Registration Company, activated in April 1951. It was difficult to recover remains and conduct burials in Korea, due to the rugged geography and harsh climate, and the threat of unexploded ordnance and booby-traps.\n\nConstruction of the United Nations Military Cemetery (UNMC) at Tanggok began on January 18, 1951 and was carried out by hand-labor over a site. It was dedicated by General Matthew Ridgway on April 6, 1951. Graves Registration units then concentrated American and allied remains at Tanggok before they were permanently buried or repatriated. Besides burial services, refrigeration units to store remains were added, as were cremation facilities. Today the 2,300 graves in the cemetery are set out in 22 sites designated by the nationalities of the buried service members.\n\nFollowing the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in July 1953, the United Nations Command sought to recover bodies interred in North Korean territory. Cemeteries for POWs in North Korea were established at 16 POW camps. From September to October 1954, the resulting exchange of casualties, dubbed Operation Glory, between United Nations forces and the North Koreans resulted in 4,219 remains being recovered, of which 1,275 were non-US casualties. (Also exchanged were the remains of approximately 14,000 North Korean and Chinese casualties.) From 1950 to 1954, approximately 11,000 casualties were interred at UNMC, which was maintained by the United States Army Graves Registration Agency.\n\nIt was officially established as the United Nations Memorial Cemetery on December 15, 1955 with the passage of UN General Assembly Resolution 977(X). Following the war, the cemetery was funded from the United Nations budget, but the Sino-Soviet world objected to this funding. In 1973, the cemetery was transferred from the UN to the Commission for the United Nations Memorial Cemetery (CUNMCK), which is composed of representatives from the 11 countries who have servicemembers buried there.\n\nThe cemetery is designated as Site 359 in the listing of Registered Cultural Heritage Sites in Korea by the Cultural Heritage Administration of Korea. Also, it is a visitor attraction for Pacific Rim tourists. In 2011, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon described it as the only United Nations cemetery in the world.\n\nAn Honour Guard from the Republic of Korea 53rd Division carries out flag ceremonies daily.\n\nThe UN Sculpture Park was established in October 2001 and twenty-nine permanent memorials are in the cemetery. The memorials include:\n\nThe Wall of Remembrance, completed in 2006, has the names of the 40,896 United Nations casualties (killed and missing) inscribed on 140 marble panels.\n\nThe UNMCK maintains a website in Korean, English, and Turkish (Türkçe), which allows website visitors to post online flowers and tributary messages.\n\nThe cemetery contains the graves of 2,289 military personnel and 11 non-combatants. Amongst those are the graves of Bill Madden GC, 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, (who died as a prisoner of war), Kenneth Muir VC (killed in action in the Battle of Hill 282 while serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders), and Philip Curtis VC (killed in action in the Battle of the Imjin River while serving with The Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry). Also buried is Lt. Col. Charles Hercules Green DSO, commander of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, who was mortally wounded at Battle of Chongju and died at nearby Anju. Dutch Lt. Col. , commander of the Regiment Van Heutsz, was killed in action during Operation Roundup in 1951 and is buried with members of his regiment—posthumously, den Ouden was awarded Netherlands' highest military award, the Military Order of William. In the early days of the war, journalist Christopher Buckley died from a land mine explosion, and was subsequently buried at the cemetery.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1954 there were about 11,000 burials of UN troops in 21 countries. As of 2012, there are 2,300 wards of eleven countries, including 36 of the Republic of Korea troops deployed to the United Nations military bases. Because burials of seven counties graves were retrieved back to their homeland, including Belgium, Colombia, Ethiopia, Greece, Luxembourg, Philippines and Thailand.\nThe burials of British Commonwealth Forces Korea are located in United Nations Memorial Cemetery. The numbers are 885 British troops, in accordance with the English customs of the dead.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "215257", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215257", "title": "Victory in Europe Day", "text": "Victory in Europe Day\n\nVictory in Europe Day, generally known as V-E Day, VE Day or simply V Day, was celebrated on 8 May 1945 to mark the formal acceptance by the Allies of World War II of Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender of its armed forces. The formal surrender of the German forces occupying the Channel Islands did not occur until the following day, 9 May 1945. It thus marked the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThe term VE Day existed as early as September 1944, in anticipation of victory. On 30 April 1945, Adolf Hitler, the Nazi leader, committed suicide during the Battle of Berlin. Germany's surrender, therefore, was authorized by his successor, \"Reichspräsident\" Karl Dönitz. The administration headed by Dönitz was known as the Flensburg Government. The preliminary act of military surrender was signed on 7 May in Reims, France, and the final document was signed on 8 May in Berlin, Germany.\n\nThe former Soviet Union, Serbia, Israel, and Eastern Bloc countries have historically celebrated the end of World War II on 9 May. In Ukraine since 2015, 8 May is designated as a day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, but it is not a public holiday.\n\nUpon the defeat of Germany, celebrations erupted throughout the western world. From Moscow to Los Angeles, people celebrated.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, more than one million people celebrated in the streets to mark the end of the European part of the war. In London, crowds massed in Trafalgar Square and up the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, appeared on the balcony of the palace before the cheering crowds. Princess Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth II) and her sister Princess Margaret were allowed to wander incognito among the crowds and take part in the celebrations.\n\nIn the United States, the victory happened on President Harry Truman's 61st birthday. He dedicated the victory to the memory of his predecessor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who had died of a cerebral hemorrhage less than a month earlier, on 12 April. Flags remained at half-staff for the remainder of the 30-day mourning period. Truman said of dedicating the victory to Roosevelt's memory and keeping the flags at half-staff that his only wish was \"that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to witness this day\". Later that day, Truman said that the victory made it his most enjoyable birthday.\n\nMassive celebrations also took place in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and especially in New York's Times Square.\n\nThe instrument of surrender stipulated that all hostilities had to stop at 23:01 (CET), 8th of May, just an hour before midnight. Since it was already 9th of May in the European part of the USSR, most post-Soviet states, including Russia, as well as Israel commemorate Victory Day on 9 May instead of 8 May.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14529239", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14529239", "title": "Zoophilia", "text": "Zoophilia\n\nZoophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between human and non-human animals. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).\n\nAlthough sex with animals is not outlawed in some countries, in most countries, bestiality is illegal under animal abuse laws or laws dealing with buggery or crimes against nature.\n\nThree key terms commonly used in regards to the subject — \"zoophilia\", \"bestiality\", and \"zoosexuality\" — are often used somewhat interchangeably. Some researchers distinguish between zoophilia (as a persistent sexual interest in animals) and bestiality (as sexual acts with animals), because bestiality is often not driven by a sexual preference for animals. Some studies have found that a preference for animals is rare among people who engage in sexual contact with animals. Furthermore, some zoophiles report that they have never had sexual contact with an animal. People with zoophilia are known as \"zoophiles\", though also sometimes as \"zoosexuals\", or even very simply \"zoos\". Zooerasty, sodomy, and zooerastia are other terms closely related to the subject but are less synonymous with the former terms, and are seldom used. \"Bestiosexuality\" was discussed briefly by Allen (1979), but never became widely established. Ernest Bornemann (1990, cited by Rosenbauer, 1997) coined the separate term \"zoosadism\" for those who derive pleasure – sexual or otherwise – from inflicting pain on animals. Zoosadism specifically is one member of the Macdonald triad of precursors to sociopathic behavior.\n\nThe term \"zoophilia\" was introduced into the field of research on sexuality in \"Psychopathia Sexualis\" (1886) by Krafft-Ebing, who described a number of cases of \"violation of animals (bestiality)\", as well as \"zoophilia erotica\", which he defined as a sexual attraction to animal skin or fur. The term \"zoophilia\" derives from the combination of two nouns in Greek: ζῷον (\"zṓion\", meaning \"animal\") and φιλία (\"philia\", meaning \"(fraternal) love\"). In general contemporary usage, the term \"zoophilia\" may refer to sexual activity between human and non-human animals, the desire to engage in such, or to the specific paraphilia (\"i.e.,\" the atypical arousal) which indicates a definite preference for non-human animals over humans as sexual partners. Although Krafft-Ebing also coined the term \"zooerasty\" for the paraphilia of exclusive sexual attraction to animals, that term has fallen out of general use.\n\nThe term \"zoosexual\" was proposed by Hani Miletski in 2002 as a value-neutral term. Usage of \"zoosexual\" as a noun (in reference to a person) is synonymous with zoophile, while the adjectival form of the word – as, for instance, in the phrase \"zoosexual act\" – may indicate sexual activity between a human and a non-human animal. The derivative noun \"zoosexuality\" is sometimes used by self-identified zoophiles in both support groups and on internet-based discussion forums to designate sexual orientation manifesting as romantic or emotional involvement with, or sexual attraction to, non-human animals.\n\nThe legal term \"bestiality\" has three common pronunciations: or in the United States, and in the United Kingdom. Some zoophiles and researchers draw a distinction between \"zoophilia\" and \"bestiality\", using the former to describe the desire to form sexual relationships with animals, and the latter to describe the sex acts alone. Confusing the matter yet further, writing in 1962, Masters used the term \"bestialist\" specifically in his discussion of zoosadism.\n\nStephanie LaFarge, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the New Jersey Medical School, and Director of Counseling at the ASPCA, writes that two groups can be distinguished: bestialists, who rape or abuse animals, and zoophiles, who form an emotional and sexual attachment to animals. Colin J. Williams and Martin Weinberg studied self-defined zoophiles via the internet and reported them as understanding the term \"zoophilia\" to involve concern for the animal's welfare, pleasure, and consent, as distinct from the self-labelled zoophiles' concept of \"bestialists\", whom the zoophiles in their study defined as focused on their own gratification. Williams and Weinberg also quoted a British newspaper saying that \"zoophilia\" is a term used by \"apologists\" for \"bestiality\".\n\nThe Kinsey reports rated the percentage of people who had sexual interaction with animals at some point in their lives as 8% for men and 3.6% for women, and claimed it was 40–50% in people living near farms, but some later writers dispute the figures, because the study lacked a random sample in that it included a disproportionate number of prisoners, causing sampling bias. Martin Duberman has written that it is difficult to get a random sample in sexual research, and that even when Paul Gebhard, Kinsey's research successor, removed prison samples from the figures, he found the figures were not significantly changed.\n\nBy 1974, the farm population in the USA had declined by 80 percent compared with 1940, reducing the opportunity to live with animals; Hunt's 1974 study suggests that these demographic changes led to a significant change in reported occurrences of bestiality. The percentage of males who reported sexual interactions with animals in 1974 was 4.9% (1948: 8.3%), and in females in 1974 was 1.9% (1953: 3.6%). Miletski believes this is not due to a reduction in interest but merely a reduction in opportunity.\n\nNancy Friday's 1973 book on female sexuality, \"My Secret Garden\", comprised around 190 fantasies from different women; of these, 23 involve zoophilic activity.\n\nIn one study, psychiatric patients were found to have a statistically significant higher prevalence rate (55 percent) of reported bestiality, both actual sexual contacts (45 percent) and sexual fantasy (30 percent) than the control groups of medical in-patients (10 percent) and psychiatric staff (15 percent). Crépault and Couture (1980) reported that 5.3 percent of the men they surveyed had fantasized about sexual activity with an animal during heterosexual intercourse. In a 2014 study, 3% of women and 2.2% of men reported fantasies about having sex with an animal. A 1982 study suggested that 7.5 percent of 186 university students had interacted sexually with an animal.\nSexual arousal from watching animals mate is known as \"faunoiphilia\". A frequent interest in and sexual excitement at watching animals mate is cited as an indicator of latent zoophilia by Massen (1994). Sexual fantasies about zoophilic acts can occur in people who do not have any wish to experience them in real life. Nancy Friday notes that zoophilia as a fantasy may provide an escape from cultural expectations, restrictions, and judgements in regard to sex. Masters (1962) says that some brothel madams used to stage exhibitions of animals mating, as they found it aroused potential clientele, and that this may have encouraged the clients to engage in bestiality..\nSeveral studies have found that women show stronger vaginal responses to films depicting bonobo copulation than to non-sexual stimuli.\n\nZoophilia has been partly discussed by several sciences: Psychology (the study of the human mind), sexology (a relatively new discipline primarily studying human sexuality), ethology (the study of animal behavior), and anthrozoology (the study of human-animal interactions and bonds).\n\nThe nature of animal minds, animal mental processes and structures, and animal self-awareness, perception, emotion in animals, and \"map of the world\", are studied within animal cognition and also explored within various specialized branches of neuroscience such as neuroethology.\n\nIn the fifth edition of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM-5), zoophilia is placed in the classification \"other specified paraphilic disorder\" (\"paraphilias not otherwise specified\" in the DSM-III and IV). The World Health Organization takes the same position, listing a sexual preference for animals in its ICD-10 as \"other disorder of sexual preference\". In the DSM-5, it rises to the level of a diagnosable disorder only when accompanied by distress or interference with normal functioning.\n\nZoophilia may also be covered to some degree by other fields such as ethics, philosophy, law, animal rights and animal welfare. It may also be touched upon by sociology which looks both at zoosadism in examining patterns and issues related to sexual abuse and at non-sexual zoophilia in examining the role of animals as emotional support and companionship in human lives, and may fall within the scope of psychiatry if it becomes necessary to consider its significance in a clinical context.\nThe Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine (Vol. 18, February 2011) states that sexual contact with animals is almost never a clinically significant problem by itself; it also states that there are several kinds of zoophiles:\n\nAdditionally, zoophiles in categories 2, 3, and 8 (romantic zoophiles, zoophilic fantasizers, and regular zoophiles) are the most common, while zoophiles found in categories 6 and 7 (sadistic bestials and opportunistic zoophiles) are the least common.\n\nZoophilia may reflect childhood experimentation, sexual abuse or lack of other avenues of sexual expression. Exclusive desire for animals rather than humans is considered a rare paraphilia, and sufferers often have other paraphilias with which they present. Zoophiles will not usually seek help for their condition, and so do not come to the attention of psychiatrists for zoophilia itself.\n\nThe first detailed studies of zoophilia date from prior to 1910. Peer reviewed research into zoophilia in its own right started around 1960. However, a number of the most oft-quoted studies, such as Miletski, were not published in peer-reviewed journals. There have been several significant modern books, from Masters (1962) to Beetz (2002); their research arrived at the following conclusions:\n\nBeetz also states the following:\n\n\"The phenomenon of sexual contact with animals is starting to lose its taboo: it is appearing more often in scholarly publications, and the public are being confronted with it, too.[...] Sexual contact with animals – in the form of bestiality or zoophilia – needs to be discussed more openly and investigated in more detail by scholars working in disciplines such as animal ethics, animal behavior, anthrozoology, psychology, mental health, sociology, and the law.\"\n\nMore recently, research has engaged three further directions – the speculation that at least some animals seem to enjoy a zoophilic relationship assuming sadism is not present, and can form an affectionate bond. Similar findings are also reported by Kinsey (cited by Masters), and others earlier in history. Miletski (1999) notes that information on sex with animals on the internet is often very emphatic as to what the zoophile believes gives pleasure and how to identify what is perceived as consent beforehand. For instance, Jonathan Balcombe says animals do things for pleasure. But he himself says pet owners will be unimpressed by this statement, as this is not news to them.\n\nBeetz described the phenomenon of zoophilia/bestiality as being somewhere between crime, paraphilia and love, although she says that most research has been based on criminological reports, so the cases have frequently involved violence and psychiatric illness. She says only a few recent studies have taken data from volunteers in the community. As with all volunteer surveys and sexual ones in particular, these studies have a potential for self-selection bias.\n\nMedical research suggests that some zoophiles only become aroused by a specific species (such as horses), some zoophiles become aroused by multiple species (which may or may not include humans), and some zoophiles are not attracted to humans at all.\n\nResearchers who observed a monkey trying to mate with a deer in 2017 (interspecies sex) said that it may provide clues into why humans have interspecies sex.\n\nInstances of this behavior have been found in the Bible. In a cave painting from at least 8000 BC in the Northern Italian Val Camonica a man is shown about to penetrate an animal. Raymond Christinger interprets that as a show of power of a tribal chief, and so we do not know if this practice was then more acceptable, and if the scene depicted was usual or unusual or whether it was symbolic or imaginary. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Prehistoric Art says the scene may be humorous, as the penetrating man seems to be waving cheerfully with his hand at the same time. Potters seem to have spent time depicting the practice, but this may be because they found the idea amusing. Dr \"Jacobus X\", said to be a nom-de-plume for a French author, said this was clearly \"before any known taboos against sex with animals existed.\" Marc Epprecht states that authors such as Jacobus X do not deserve respect because their methodology is based on hearsay, and was designed for voyeuristic titillation of the reader. Masters said that since pre-historic man is prehistoric it goes without saying that we know little of his sexual behaviour, depictions in cave paintings may only show the artist's subjective preoccupations or thoughts.\n\nPindar, Herodotus, and Plutarch claimed the Egyptians engaged in ritual congress with goats. Such claims about other cultures do not necessarily reflect anything about which the author had evidence, but be a form of propaganda or xenophobia, similar to blood libel.\n\nBestiality was accepted in some North American and Middle Eastern indigenous cultures. Sexual intercourse between humans and non-human animals was not uncommon among certain Native American indigenous peoples, including the Hopi. Voget describes the sexual lives of young Native Americans as \"rather inclusive,\" including bestiality. In addition, the Copper Inuit people had \"no aversion to intercourse with live animals\".\n\nSeveral cultures built temples (Khajuraho, India) or other structures (Sagaholm, barrow, Sweden) with zoophilic carvings on the exterior, however at Khajuraho these depictions are not on the interior, perhaps depicting that these are things that belong to the profane world rather than the spiritual world, and thus are to be left outside.\n\nIn the Church-oriented culture of the Middle Ages zoophilic activity was met with execution, typically burning, and death to the animals involved either the same way or by hanging, as \"both a violation of Biblical edicts and a degradation of man as a spiritual being rather than one that is purely animal and carnal.\" Some witches were accused of having congress with the devil in the form of an animal. As with all accusations and confessions extracted under torture in the witch trials in Early Modern Europe, their validity cannot be ascertained.\n\nPassages in Leviticus 18 (Lev 18:23: \"And you shall not lie with any beast and defile yourself with it, neither shall any woman give herself to a beast to lie with it: it is a perversion.\" RSV) and 20:15–16 (\"If a man lies with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death, their blood is upon them.\" RSV) are cited by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim theologians as categorical denunciation of bestiality. However, the teachings of the New Testament have been interpreted by some as not expressly forbidding bestiality.\n\nIn Part II of his Summa Theologica, medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas ranked various \"unnatural vices\" (sex acts resulting in \"venereal pleasure\" rather than procreation) by degrees of sinfulness, concluding that \"the most grievous is the sin of bestiality.\" Some Christian theologians extend Matthew's view that even having thoughts of adultery is sinful to imply that thoughts of committing bestial acts are likewise sinful.\n\nThere are a few references in Hindu scriptures to religious figures engaging in symbolic sexual activity with animals such as explicit depictions of people having sex with animals included amongst the thousands of sculptures of \"Life events\" on the exterior of the temple complex at Khajuraho. The depictions are largely symbolic depictions of the sexualization of some animals and are not meant to be taken literally. According to the Hindu tradition of erotic painting and sculpture, having sex with an animal is believed to be actually a human having sex with a God incarnated in the form of an animal. However, in some Hindu scriptures, such as the \"Bhagavata Purana\" and the \"Devi Bhagavata Purana\", having sex with animals, especially the cow, leads one to Hell, where one is tormented by having one's body rubbed on trees with razor-sharp thorns.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, all forms of zoophilic acts are prohibited; others outlaw only the mistreatment of animals, without specific mention of sexual activity. In the United Kingdom, Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 (also known as the Extreme Pornography Act) outlaws images of a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive). Despite the UK Ministry of Justice's explanatory note on extreme images saying \"It is not a question of the intentions of those who produced the image. Nor is it a question of the sexual arousal of the defendant\", \"it could be argued that a person might possess such an image for the purposes of satire, political commentary or simple grossness,\" according to \"The Independent\".\n\nMany new laws banning sex with animals have been made recently, such as in New Hampshire, Ohio, Germany, Sweden, Denmark,Thailand, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Guatemala. The number of jurisdictions around the world banning it has grown in the 2000s and 2010s.\n\nThe only EU countries where zoophilia remains legal are Finland, Hungary, and Romania.\n\nLaws on zoophilia are sometimes triggered by specific incidents. While some laws are very specific, others employ vague terms such as \"sodomy\" or \"bestiality\", which lack legal precision and leave it unclear exactly which acts are covered. In the past, some bestiality laws may have been made in the belief that sex with an animal could result in monstrous offspring, as well as offending the community. Current anti-cruelty laws focus more specifically on animal welfare while anti-bestiality laws are aimed only at offenses to community \"standards\".\nNotable legal views include Sweden, where a 2005 report by the Swedish Animal Welfare Agency for the government expressed concern over the increase in reports of horse-ripping incidents. The agency believed current animal cruelty legislation was not sufficient in protecting animals from abuse and needed updating, but concluded that on balance it was not appropriate to call for a ban. In New Zealand, the 1989 Crimes Bill considered abolishing bestiality as a criminal offense, and instead viewing it as a mental health issue, but they did not, and people can still be prosecuted for it. Under Section 143 of the Crimes Act 1961, individuals can serve a sentence of seven years duration for animal sexual abuse and the offence is considered 'complete' in the event of 'penetration'. In Canada a clarification of the anti-bestiality law was made in 2016 which legalizes most forms of sexual contact with animals other than penetration.\n\nSome countries once had laws against single males living with female animals, such as Alpacas. Copulating with a female alpaca is still specifically against the law in Peru.\n\nAs of 2017, bestiality is illegal in 45 U.S. states. Most state bestiality laws were enacted between 1999 and 2017. Until 2005, there was a farm near Enumclaw, Washington that was described as an “animal brothel”, where people paid to have sex with animals. After an incident on 2 July 2005, when a man was pronounced dead in the emergency room of the Enumclaw community hospital after his colon ruptured due to having been sodomized by a horse, the farm garnered police attention. The state legislature of the State of Washington, which had been one of the few states in the United States without a law against bestiality, within six months passed a bill making bestiality illegal. Arizona, Alaska, Florida, Alabama, New Jersey, New Hampshire, Ohio, Texas, Vermont, and Nevada have banned sex with animals between 2006 and the present, with the latter 5 all banning it in 2017. When such laws are proposed, they are never questioned or debated. Laws which prohibit non-abusive bestiality have been criticized for being discriminatory, unjust and unconstitutional.\n\nPornography involving sex with animals is widely illegal, even in most countries where bestiality itself is not explicitly outlawed.\n\nIn the United States, zoophilic pornography would be considered obscene if it did not meet the standards of the Miller Test and therefore is not openly sold, mailed, distributed or imported across state boundaries or within states which prohibit it. Under U.S. law, 'distribution' includes transmission across the Internet. Production and mere possession appears to be legal, however. U.S. prohibitions on distribution of sexual or obscene materials are in some doubt, having been ruled unconstitutional in \"United States v. Extreme Associates\" (a judgement which was overturned on appeal, December 2005).\n\nSimilar restrictions apply in Germany (see above). In New Zealand the possession, making or distribution of material promoting bestiality is illegal.\n\nThe potential use of media for pornographic movies was seen from the start of the era of silent film. \"Polissons and Galipettes\" (re-released 2002 as \"The Good Old Naughty Days\") is a collection of early French silent films for brothel use, including some animal pornography, dating from around 1905 – 1930.\n\nMaterial featuring sex with animals is widely available on the Internet, due to its ease of production. Prior to the advent of mass-market magazines such as Playboy, so-called Tijuana Bibles were a form of pornographic tract popular in America, sold as anonymous underground publications typically comprising a small number of stapled comic-strips representing characters and celebrities.\nThe promotion of \"stars\" began with the Danish Bodil Joensen, in the period of 1969–72, along with other porn actors such as the Americans Linda Lovelace (\"Dogarama\", 1969), Chessie Moore (multiple films, c. 1994), Kerri Downs (three films, 1998) and Calina Lynx (aka Kelly G'raffe) (two films, 1998). Another early film to attain great infamy was \"Animal Farm\", smuggled into Great Britain around 1980 without details as to makers or provenance. The film was later traced to a crude juxtaposition of smuggled cuts from many of Bodil Joensen's 1970s Danish movies.\n\nInto the 1980s the Dutch took the lead, creating figures like \"Wilma\" and the \"Dutch Sisters\". In the 1980s, \"bestiality\" was featured in Italian adult films with actresses like Denise Dior, Francesca Ray, and Marina Hedman, manifested early in the softcore flick \"Bestialità\" in 1976.\n\nToday, in Hungary, where production faces no legal limitations, zoophilic materials have become a substantial industry that produces numerous films and magazines, particularly for Dutch companies such as \"Topscore\" and \"Book & Film International\", and the genre has stars such as \"Hector\", a Great Dane starring in several films. Many Hungarian mainstream performers also appeared anonymously in animal pornography in their early careers. For example, Suzy Spark.\n\nIn Japan, animal pornography is used to bypass censorship laws, often featuring Japanese and Swedish female models performing fellatio on animals, because oral penetration of a non-human penis is not in the scope of Japanese mosaic censor. Sakura Sakurada is an AV idol known to have appeared in animal pornography, specifically in the AV \"The Dog Game\" in 2006. While primarily underground, there are a number of animal pornography actresses who specialize in bestiality movies. A box-office success of the 1980s, \"24 Horas de Sexo Explícito\" featured zoophilia.\n\nIn the UK Section 63 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 criminalises possession of realistic pornographic images depicting sex with animals (see extreme pornography), including fake images and simulated acts, as well as images depicting sex with dead animals, where no crime has taken place in the production. The law provides for sentences of up to two years in prison; a sentence of 12 months was handed down in one case in 2011.\n\nPornography of this sort has become the business of certain spammers such as Jeremy Jaynes and owners of some fake TGPs, who use the promise of \"extreme\" material as a bid for users' attention.\n\nInfections that are transmitted from animals to humans are called zoonoses. Some zoonoses may be transferred through casual contact, but others are much more readily transferred by activities that expose humans to the semen, vaginal fluids, urine, saliva, feces and blood of animals. Examples of zoonoses are Brucellosis, Q fever, leptospirosis, and toxocariasis. Therefore, sexual activity with animals is, in some instances, a high risk activity. Allergic reactions to animal semen may occur, including anaphylaxis. Bites and other trauma from penetration or trampling may occur.\n\nThe love of animals is not necessarily sexual in nature. In psychology and sociology the word \"zoophilia\" is sometimes used without sexual implications. Being fond of animals in general, or as pets, is accepted in Western society, and is usually respected or tolerated. However, the word zoophilia is used to mean a sexual preference towards animals, which makes it a paraphilia. Some zoophiles may not act on their sexual attraction to animals. People who identify as zoophiles may feel their love for animals is romantic rather than purely sexual, and say this makes them different from those committing entirely sexually motivated acts of bestiality.\n\nAn online survey which recruited participants over the internet concluded that prior to the arrival of widespread computer networking, most zoophiles would not have known other zoophiles, and for the most part, zoophiles engaged in bestiality secretly, or told only trusted friends, family or partners. The internet and its predecessors made people able to search for information on topics which were not otherwise easily accessible and to communicate with relative safety and anonymity. Because of the diary-like intimacy of blogs and the anonymity of the internet, zoophiles had the ideal opportunity to \"openly\" express their sexuality. As with many other alternate lifestyles, broader networks began forming in the 1980s when participating in networked social groups became more common at home and elsewhere. Such developments in general were described by Markoff in 1990; the linking of computers meant that people thousands of miles apart could feel the intimacy akin to being in a small village together. The popular newsgroup alt.sex.bestiality, said to be in the top 1% of newsgroup interest (i.e. number 50 out of around 5000), – and reputedly started in humor – along with personal bulletin boards and talkers, chief among them Sleepy's multiple worlds, Lintilla, and Planes of Existence, were among the first group media of this kind in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These groups rapidly drew together zoophiles, some of whom also created personal and social websites and internet forums. By around 1992–1994, the wide social net had evolved. This was initially centered around the above-mentioned newsgroup, alt.sex.bestiality, which during the six years following 1990 had matured into a discussion and support group. The newsgroup included information about health issues, laws governing zoophilia, bibliography relating to the subject, and community events. Since the 1990s, other zoophile websites have been created and have grown in size; for example, the zoophile website and internet forum \"beastforum.com\" has more than one million members as of March 2012.\n\nWeinberg and Williams observe that the internet can socially integrate an incredibly large number of people. In Kinsey’s day contacts between animal lovers were more localized and limited to male compatriots in a particular rural community. Further, while the farm boys Kinsey researched might have been part of a rural culture in which sex with animals was a part, the sex itself did not define the community. The zoophile community is not known to be particularly large compared to other subcultures which make use of the internet, so Weinberg and Williams surmised its aims and beliefs would likely change little as it grew. Those particularly active on the internet may not be aware of a wider subculture, as there is not much of a wider subculture, Weinberg and Williams felt the virtual zoophile group would lead the development of the subculture.\n\nThere also exist websites which aim to provide support and social assistance to zoophiles (including resources to help and rescue abused or mistreated animals), but these are not usually well publicized. Such work is often undertaken as needed by individuals and friends, within social networks, and by word of mouth. One notable early attempt at creating a zoophile support structure focused on social and psychological support was the newsgroup soc.support.zoophilia, which was proposed in 1994 but narrowly failed to meet the 2/3 majority needed to be created. There was also a German support group called \"Interessengemeinschaft Zoophiler Menschen (\"Zoophile Interest Group\").\n\nZoophiles tend to experience their first zoosexual feelings during adolescence, and tend to be secretive about it, hence limiting the ability for non-Internet communities to form:\n\n\"I asked him [a zoophile] when he had his first inkling of being a zoophile. 'When you're a kid, you're not really aware of too much sexually,' he says. 'But I was always interested in animals, starting around age 10. It was an extension of my affection for the dog and of my discovery of sex. He's a male. I'm a male. I wanted to make him feel good.' His attraction to dogs became stronger in his teens and stronger yet in his 20s. 'For years, I thought I was the only one who did this,' James says. 'I felt like there was no one I could talk to about this. I definitely knew I wasn't going to be talking to my parents or my friends about this.'[...] 'This is not a fetish,' James says of his attractions. 'It's an orientation, a lifestyle.'\"\n\nBecause of its controversial nature, people have developed arguments both for and against zoophilia. Arguments for and against zoosexual activity from a variety of sources, including religious, moral, ethical, psychological, medical and social.\n\nBestiality is seen by the government of the United Kingdom as profoundly disturbed behavior (as indicated by the UK Home Office review on sexual offences in 2002). Andrea Beetz states there is evidence that there can be violent zoosadistic approaches to sex with animals. Beetz argues that animals might be traumatized even by a non-violent, sexual approach from a human; however, Beetz also says that in some cases, non-abusive bestiality can be reciprocally pleasurable for both the human and non-human animal.\n\nAn argument from human dignity is given by Wesley J. Smith, a senior fellow and Intelligent Design proponent at the Center for Science and Culture of the conservative Christian Discovery Institute: – \"such behavior is profoundly degrading and utterly subversive to the crucial understanding that human beings are unique, special, and of the highest moral worth in the known universe—a concept known as 'human exceptionalism' ... one of the reasons bestiality is condemned through law is that such degrading conduct unacceptably subverts standards of basic human dignity and is an affront to humankind's inestimable importance and intrinsic moral worth.\"\n\nOne of the primary critiques of bestiality is that it is harmful to animals and necessarily abusive, because animals are unable to give or withhold consent.\n\nThe Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has said that as animals do not have the same capacity for thinking as humans, they are unable to give full consent. The HSUS takes the position that all sexual activity between humans and animals is abusive, whether it involves physical injury or not. In his 1993 article, Dr. Frank Ascione stated that \"bestiality may be considered abusive even in cases when physical harm to an animal does not occur.\" In a 1997 article, Piers Beirne, Professor of Criminology at the University of Southern Maine, points out that 'for genuine consent to sexual relations to be present...both participants must be conscious, fully informed and positive in their desires.'\n\nSome defenders of bestiality argue that the issue of sexual consent is irrelevant because many legal human practices (such as semen collection, artificial insemination, hunting, laboratory testing, and slaughtering animals for meat) do not involve the consent of the animal. Brian Cutteridge states the following regarding this argument:\n\n\"Animal sexual autonomy is regularly violated for human financial gain through procedures such as [artificial insemination and slaughter]. Such procedures are probably more disturbing physically and psychologically than acts of zoophilia would be, yet the issue of consent on the part of the animal is never raised in the discussion of such procedures. To confine the 'right' of any animal strictly to acts of zoophilia is thus to make a law [against zoophilia] based not on reason but on moral prejudice, and to breach the constitutional rights of zoophiles to due process and equality before the law. [...] Laws which criminalize zoophilia based on societal abhorrence of such acts rather than any real harm caused by such acts are an unjust and unconstitutional infringement on individual liberty.\"\n\nMiletski believes that \"Animals are capable of sexual consent – and even initiation – in their own way.\" It is not an uncommon practice for dogs to attempt to copulate with (\"hump\") the legs of people of both genders. Rosenberger (1968) emphasizes that as far as cunnilingus is concerned, dogs require no training, and even Dekkers (1994) and Menninger (1951) admit that sometimes animals take the initiative and do so impulsively. Those supporting zoophilic activity feel animals sometimes even seem to enjoy the sexual attention or voluntarily initiate sexual activity with humans. Animals such as dogs can be willing participants in sexual activity with humans, and \"seem to enjoy the attention provided by the sexual interaction with a human.\" Animal owners normally know what their own pets like or do not like. Most people can tell if an animal does not like how it is being petted, because it will move away. An animal that is liking being petted pushes against the hand, and seems to enjoy it. To those defending bestiality this is seen as a way in which animals give consent, or the fact that a dog might wag its tail.\n\nUtilitarian philosopher and animal liberation author Peter Singer argues that bestiality is not unethical so long as it involves no harm or cruelty to the animal (see \"Harm principle\"). In the article \"Heavy Petting,\" Singer argues that zoosexual activity need not be abusive, and that relationships could form which were mutually enjoyed. Singer and others have argued that people's dislike of bestiality is partly caused by irrational speciesism and anthropocentrism. Because interspecies sex occurs in nature, and because humans \"are\" animals, supporters argue that zoosexual activity is not \"unnatural\" and is not intrinsically wrong.\n\nResearch has proven that non-human animals can and do have sex for non-reproductive purposes (and for pleasure). In 2006, a Danish Animal Ethics Council report concluded that ethically performed zoosexual activity is capable of providing a positive experience for all participants, and that some non-human animals are sexually attracted to humans (for example, dolphins).\n\nSome zoophiles claim that they are not abusive towards animals:\n\n\"In other recent surveys, the majority of zoophiles scoffed at the notion that they were abusive toward animals in any way—far from it, they said. Many even consider themselves to be animal welfare advocates in addition to zoophiles.\"\n\nBecause of its controversial nature, different countries vary in the discussion of bestiality. Often sexual matters are the subject of legal or regulatory requirement. In 2005 the UK broadcasting regulator (OFCOM) updated its code stating that freedom of expression is at the heart of any democratic state. Adult audiences should be informed as to what they will be viewing or hearing, and the young, who cannot make a fully informed choice for themselves, should be protected. Hence a watershed and other precautions were set up for explicit sexual material, to protect young people. Zoophile activity and other sexual matters may be discussed, but only in an appropriate context and manner.\n\nThe IPT was replaced after the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act in 1993, replaced with bodies designed to allow both more debate and increased consistency, and possession and supply of material that it is decided are objectionable was made a criminal offence.\n\nMention in the media is often comical in nature. References to bestiality are not uncommon in some media, especially adult cartoon series such as \"Family Guy\" and \"South Park\", satirical comedy such as \"Borat\", and films (especially shock exploitation films), although a few broadcasters such as Howard Stern (who joked about bestiality dial-a-date on NBC) and Tom Binns (whose XFM London Breakfast Show resulted on one occasion in a live discussion about the ethics of zoophilic pornographic movies at peak child listening time) have been reprimanded by their stations for doing so.\n\nIn literature, American novelist Kurt Vonnegut refers to a photo of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a Shetland Pony in \"The Sirens of Titan\", \"Slaughterhouse Five\", and \"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater\". Philip K. Dick also refers to a photo of a woman copulating with a Shetland Pony in \"Flow My Tears The Policeman Said\". John Irving's novel \"The Cider House Rules\" repeatedly mentions a pornographic photograph depicting oral sex on a pony. In \"Clerks II\" Randal orders a donkey show as a going away present for his best friend Dante, in which it is referred to as \"interspecies erotica\" by the male performer.\n\nPu Songling refers to zoophilia in the \"Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio\" short story \"The Fornicating Dog\", which talks about sexual relations between a woman and her white dog.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n"}
