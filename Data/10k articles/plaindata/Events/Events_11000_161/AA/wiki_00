The tornado outbreak produced several significant tornadoes including an F5 tornado which traveled through Barneveld, Wisconsin, in the early hours of June 8, 1984. The entire outbreak killed at least 13 people across three states including 9 in Barneveld alone.\n\nA low pressure system entered the Midwestern United States on June 7, 1984, and intensified while bringing a surge of moist and humid air coming from the Gulf of Mexico. After most of the affected areas were hit by a Mesoscale Convective Complex earlier during the morning of June 7, the unstable atmosphere, as well as wind shear and high CAPE values produced a favorable environment for the development of extensive severe weather with possible tornadoes. Starting at around mid-afternoon, it started to produce several tornadoes across southern Minnesota and northwestern and southern Iowa including three F3s and a long-track F4 which traveled over 130 miles from extreme northern Missouri to southwest of Iowa City. That tornado killed 3 people including one in Missouri's Harrison County. Another person was killed in Ringgold County in Iowa by an F2 tornado at around 9:00 PM CDT. Activity continued through the overnight hours as a new cluster of storms developed across Wisconsin near the Iowa and Illinois borders and produced strong tornadoes including the Barneveld tornado up until the early morning hours of June 8, 1984, before dissipating.\n\nStraight-line winds in excess of 100 mph and very large hail were also reported in eastern Iowa from the storm that went on to drop the tornado in Barneveld, Wisconsin.\n\nAs the tornado activity calmed down across Iowa and Minnesota in which numerous strong to severe tornadoes struck those areas from mid-afternoon to mid-evening, the severe weather shifted east towards Wisconsin after dark where a tornado watch was issued at about 11:00 PM CDT. By this time, most of the residents of Barneveld had gone to bed and were unaware of the tornado watch. A supercell thunderstorm, which affected portions of southeastern Iowa with a few tornadoes at around 9:00 PM CDT before weakening and intensifying shortly after, entered Wisconsin from the Iowa/Illinois border at around 12:00 AM CDT near Dubuque. Shortly after 12:30 AM CDT, June 8, it produced its first tornado near Belmont in Lafayette County and lifted near Mineral Point in Iowa County about fifteen miles southwest of Barneveld.\n\nA few minutes later, this storm system produced one of the few F5 tornados to hit Wisconsin, developing northeast of Mineral Point (five to six miles southwest of Barneveld). At 12:41 CDT this F5 tornado drove through the center of Barneveld in full force, finally dissipating in northern Dane County around 1:40 AM CDT after traveling 36 miles (62 kilometers) for 59 minutes. A sharp bolt of lightning followed by a deafening clap of thunder cut the electricity to the town just a few minutes before the tornado struck Barneveld, awakened many residents. (It is said that the loss of power prevented the tornado siren from being activated prior to its arrival. In actuality, the town did not have a distinctive tornado siren from the siren used to activate the town's volunteer fire and EMT squad. If a siren had been activated, the residents would not have known it was a tornado warning.) At its peak, the tornado was nearly a quarter-mile wide. Other tornadoes rated from F1 to F3 touched down from Columbia County to Dodge County until after 3:00 AM CDT when activity finally weakened.\n\nThe tornado was responsible for nine deaths and nearly 200 injuries in Barneveld while causing about $25 million in damage. In total, all three churches (the Congregational United Church of Christ, the Lutheran Church, and the Roman Catholic Church),<!--<ref>\n"}

This led to unsanitary water conditions in the greater Boston area, which resulted in Governor Deval Patrick declaring a state of emergency and an order for residents to boil drinking water. The leak was stopped on May 2. On May 4, the order was lifted. President Barack Obama signed an emergency disaster declaration offering federal help, authorizing the Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency to coordinate disaster relief efforts with Massachusetts.\n\nMWRA executive director Frederick Laskey called the break \"catastrophic\" and \"everyone's worst nightmare in the water industry\".\n\nAt about 10 am on May 1, a collar connecting two sections of pipe ruptured in Weston, Massachusetts, disrupting the connection between the MetroWest Water Supply Tunnel and the City Tunnel.\n\nWith the water supply cut off, the emergency water supply reserve system from surrounding ponds was routed to the main water supply.\n\nThe rupture worsened as the afternoon progressed, eventually resulting in the loss of access to clean water from the Quabbin and Wachusett Reservoirs for approximately two million residents of 31 cities and towns, including Boston. At the height of the spill, approximately of water entered the Charles River per hour. By evening, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority had activated the backup water system, which was drawing water from the Chestnut Hill Reservoir, and Spot Pond Reservoir. The Sudbury Aqueduct supplied additional water to the Chestnut Hill reservoir from the Sudbury Reservoir and the Framingham #3 reservoir. Because water from these older surface reservoirs is not treated, the MWRA issued a boil order for the affected communities.\n\nThe Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) issued an emergency water notice for the Boston area. Governor Deval Patrick issued a state of emergency and a boil-water advisory for Boston and a dozen surrounding communities, affecting nearly 2 million people.\n\nLocal agency officials used a variety of means to inform locals about the situation including Everbridge, Boston's reverse 911 citizen alert system, highway alert signs, driving through affected neighborhoods with bullhorns, and other emergency management systems. As a result of the water boil order, many residents rushed to purchase bottled water at local stores. Many stores quickly sold out of water, and bottled water companies increased shipments at the request of the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, maintaining availability at other stores.\n\nLocal stores quickly sold out their supplies of bottled water, and the Massachusetts National Guard was dispatched to deliver additional bottled water. The state government also asked bottled-water suppliers to increase their deliveries to the area. Many cafes such as Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts that depended on municipal water for coffee production were closed or forced to operate with limited functionality.\n\nBy May 2, workers had stopped the spill and begun repairs on the pipe and MWRA officials reported steady water pressure on the night of May 2.\n\nExperts and officials associated with the MWRA interviewed by reporters stated that the boil-water order was necessary because the backup reservoirs were untreated and unmonitored by bacterial cultures, which take a few days to run; similar situations had resulted in bacterial contamination bad enough to cause distressing gastrointestinal symptoms in otherwise healthy adults.\n\nOn May 4, 2010, at 3 am, Massachusetts Water Resources Authority announced that Governor Patrick had lifted the water-boil order for all but one of affected communities, Saugus. In a press conference later that morning, Patrick stated that tests had since cleared the water in Saugus as well.\n\nThe test results indicated that the bacteria levels in the emergency supply were not atypical for a normal day. If this had been known earlier, the boil-water order would have been unnecessary. No health effects for vulnerable classes, such as infants, pregnant women, and those with a compromised immune system, were reported in secondary sources during this event.\n\nThe engineering investigation following the incident found that the break was caused by failure of the coupling bolts. Inspection of recovered bolts and bolt fragments found that the bolts were poorly manufactured and sized incorrectly for the load.\n"}

The festival is programmed each March the week prior to the music portion of SXSW in Austin, Texas.\n\n35 Denton is organized by a core staff of volunteers. The music festival has featured many nationally touring acts, such as The Pains of Being Pure At Heart, Local Natives, Portugal. The Man, The Flaming Lips, The Jesus and Mary Chain, The Mountain Goats, Bun B, Devin the Dude, Dr. Dog, Big Boi, Reggie Watts, The Civil Wars, Best Coast, Danny Brown, A Place to Bury Strangers, and more. Likewise, it also has a roster of notable local acts, such as Neon Indian, Midlake, Sarah Jaffe, Brave Combo, Riverboat Gamblers, Seryn, and more.\n\n2005 – 2008: The Austin Years\n\nDuring SXSW 2005, festival founder Chris Flemmons planted the seeds of 35 Denton in the soil of Big Red Sun, a floral design boutique in Austin. Thirteen Denton acts performed on a stage in the business's outdoor garden for an invite-only crowd of international journalists and industry types. The beer was free, the Tex-Mex was homemade, and the goal was uncomplicated: Show the world what Denton's all about. Flemmons called the event NX35: The Afternoon Party of the Other, Smaller, Music Town in Texas. In 2006, it took place at Club DeVille, and in 2007 and 2008, the party moved to Momo's. Some notable performers from the event's years in Austin include Centro-matic's Will Johnson, Midlake, Sarah Jaffe, and the Baptist Generals.\n\n2009 – Present: The Denton Years\n\nIn 2009, after four years in Austin, Flemmons and a small staff of volunteers brought the day party home and turned it into a multi-day festival. The goal of showcasing Denton's performers and people did not change, but the name did: NX35 Music Conferette, which opened with a keynote address led by American Splendor creator Harvey Pekar. Before the inaugural festival ended, more than 4000 people had watched over 120 acts play on the stages of Denton's numerous clubs and coffeeshops.\n\nIn 2010, more than 250 acts performed on and around Denton's downtown square – to an estimated audience of 20,000 people. The event began with keynote speaker Steve Albini and featured a now storied free Saturday night performance by the Flaming Lips and Denton's own Midlake at the North Texas Fairgrounds. Other notable performers from this era include Neon Indian, Centro-matic, Health, The Black Angels, The Baptist Generals, Brave Combo, Sarah Jaffe, Monotonix, Riverboat Gamblers, and True Widow.\n\nIn 2011, the festival changed its name to 35 Conferette. The name wasn't the only big change, as the fest expanded into the streets of downtown Denton with the addition of three outdoor stages, one of which was on the courthouse lawn. Performers included a growing roster of national talent like Big Boi, Mavis Staples, Dr. Dog, Reggie Watts, Japanther, and Damien Jurado. In the months that followed, 35 Conferette was named Best Promotional Event of 2011 by the Texas Downtown Association. Festival founder Chris Flemmons handed the event's future to a new leadership staff led by Creative Director Kyle La Valley and Programming Director, Natalie Dávila. The festival's name changed to 35 Denton in July 2011.\n\nIn 2012, 35 Denton was headlined by The Jesus and Mary Chain – though they performed a few days later than anticipated. After visa issues prevented their Saturday night appearance, the band played the following Wednesday at the North Texas Fairgrounds, with Ty Segall as an opening act. Other notable 2012 acts included Built to Spill, Bun B, The Raincoats, OM, Best Coast, Thee Oh Sees, and Dum Dum Girls.In 2013, 35 Denton featured performances by Solange, Sleep, Roky Erickson, Com Truise, Silver Apples, Killer Mike, Thee Oh Sees, Akron/Family, Man Man, Mikal Cronin, Mac DeMarco, Beach Fossils, Reigning Sound, Marnie Stern, Soul Clap, and the live Texas debut of Thurston Moore's side-project Chelsea Light Moving.\n\nAfter 2013, La Valley and Dávila left the festival leadership and the organization's primary investors withdrew funding. The festival did not take place in 2014, opting instead to take a year off to reorganize and locate new investors. During this time, a new Denton music festival in Oaktopia was formed to run opposite 35 Denton in the fall of each year.\n\nIn 2015, 35 Denton returned under the theme \"Back To The Music\", and featured performances by the 1970s The Zombies, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Cymbals Eat Guitars, Chastity Belt (band), Lowell (musician), S U R V I V E, and the reunion performance of Ten Hands (band) led by local musician Paul Slavens.\n\nIn 2016, was headlined by the soul artist Charles Bradley (singer) and his Extraordinaires, hip-hop throwback Biz Markie, and Eliot Sumner, the child of English rock musician Sting (musician). Other notable performances were by Electric Six, Fat Tony (rapper), Class Actress, Tacocat, Sheer Mag, Alesia Lani and the Mydolls.\n\nThe 2017 event was canceled without firm plans to revive the festival.\n\nA unique aspect of the festival is its evolving name and image; each change coming from a different impetus.\n\nIn May 2012, 35 Denton announced a one-day end of summer party to take place on September 1, 2012 entitled 'The Hot Wet Mess.' The festival's first venture into event production outside the 35 Denton festival took place at the North Texas Fairgrounds and featured Black Lips, No Age, Reggie Watts, Big Freedia, Unknown Mortal Orchestra as well as local acts Fergus & Geronimo, DJ Sober and RTB2. The event was sponsored by Vitamin Water and Corona Light, and consisted of attractions such as a water slide to overlook the stage.\n\n\n"}

He served as Mayor of Christchurch from 2007 to 2013.\n\nParker grew up in the Christchurch suburbs of Heathcote Valley and Somerfield. He attended Christchurch South Intermediate and Cashmere High School. He studied an intermediate year in zoology at the University of Canterbury before undertaking casual work.\n\nParker got his first job on radio, in Nelson. His broadcasting career then took him to Christchurch, Wellington and then Auckland. He was the associate producer and original host (1984–1996) of the New Zealand version of the \"This is Your Life\" series after he purchased the New Zealand television rights for the show from Ralph Edwards Productions in California. He returned to Christchurch in 1992.\n\nParker's local government career spanned more than two decades. He first became politically active when he filled a councillor vacancy on the Banks Peninsula District Council in 1994. Having lived in Akaroa for several years, he served as mayor of Banks Peninsula District for two terms (2001–2006). He favoured amalgamation of the district with Christchurch City and led a high profile and controversial campaign leading to a poll in 2005. Amalgamation with the City was supported by 65% of the Peninsula's voters Amalgamation took place on 3 March 2006, at which Parker, after winning a by-election, became a Christchurch city councillor, and the sole Banks Peninsula representative on the council.\n\nIn 2006 Parker was elected as the independent chair of the Greater Christchurch Urban Development Strategy. This saw the bringing together of four local councils—Christchurch, Selwyn, Waimakariri and the Canterbury Regional Council—for a major planning undertaking based on creating a sustainable growth plan for the greater Christchurch area. The Strategy was adopted in 2007 by all of the member councils and is today the basis for all spatial planning in the greater Christchurch area.\n\nIn October 2007, Parker successfully stood in the local government elections for the Christchurch mayoralty, after the retirement of Garry Moore. He received 47,033 votes, with Megan Woods (32,821) and Jo Giles (14,454) in the election contested by ten candidates.\n\nParker announced in 2009 that he would seek re-election at the 2010 Christchurch mayoral election.\n\nDespite being the incumbent, he initially polled behind his major challenger until the large 2010 Canterbury earthquake on 4 September 2010. His high-profile handling of the civil emergency was widely praised, and polls taken later showed him taking the lead. It was announced on 9 October that Parker had been re-elected for a second term with 68,245 of the votes to Jim Anderton's 51,566 based on 98% of the votes counted.\n\nParker was the incumbent mayor at the time of the September 2010 Canterbury earthquake. During the days following the quake, he worked with Civil Defence, the police and the New Zealand Army to get the city back up and running. In October 2010, Christchurch band The Bats and many others played at a free earthquake relief concert in Hagley Park in front of about 140,000 people. Parker joined The Bats for the performance and played guitar.\n\nBefore the earthquake, some polls had Parker trailing Anderton but his high profile since 4 September and cool handling of the earthquake's aftermath won him widespread praise and the support of voters who overwhelmingly backed him to run the city for a second term.\n\nParker was the media face of the recovery efforts in the aftermath of the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, working with the police and the army and rescue squads, as well as answering the media's questions.\n\nOn 18 March 2011, Parker addressed the national Christchurch memorial service at Hagley Park of Christchurch in the presence of Prince William, Prime Minister John Key, Dame Malvina Major, Hayley Westenra, ChristChurch Cathedral Choir, dignitaries, international rescue teams and tens of thousands of New Zealanders.\n\nAfter the February earthquake the New Zealand Government brought in a special act of Parliament, The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act, which essentially passed ultimate responsibility for the rebuilding of post-quake Christchurch to the Government. The Council was given the task of preparing a new plan to rebuild the central business district of the city. The project, chaired by Parker, was titled \"share an idea\". It won international acclaim for the Council, including the international \"Co Creation\" award - the first time this award had been granted outside of Europe.\n\nOutrage was expressed at the Council, after Christchurch City Council CEO Tony Marryatt was given a near $70,000 pay rise in 2011. A protest was held at the City Council Building on 1 February 2012. Approximately 4000 citizens turned up to protest the decision of the City Council, and to call for a mid-term election.\n\nIn April 2013 when the government announced the cost of the rebuild was going to be as much as $40 billion, Parker said it was \"no surprise\", and welcomed the extra investment as being \"good for GDP\".\nIn mid-June 2013, Minister for Earthquake Recovery Gerry Brownlee revealed in a press conference that International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) had written to Christchurch City Council threatening to revoke its accreditation for issuing building consents. This caught Parker by surprise, as he knew nothing of this threat, and he criticised Brownlee for not communicating with him before the press conference; Parker famously labelled Brownlee's practice a \"media missile\". Brownlee and Parker had at times a strained relationship, with the government taking an increasing amount of control in local decision making.\n\nIn July 2013, Parker announced on \"Campbell Live\" he would not be running for re-election in the 2013 Christchurch mayoral elections, citing exhaustion and not having the required energy for a third term as mayor. He stated that although staff had assured him they would satisfy the requirements of the consenting process the accreditation had been withdrawn; as this had happened on \"his watch\" as Mayor he felt he should take responsibility for the loss.\n\nIn July 2013 an editorial in \"The Press\" noted that a tribute paid to Parker by the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key was \"well deserved\". The Prime Minister in a speech to the Local Government New Zealand organisation in 2013 stated that Parker's \"commitment to the city during its darkest hours will be his legacy\".\n\nIn the 2014 New Year Honours, Parker was appointed a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to local-body affairs and the community. An editorial in \"The Press\" stated that Parker had \"fronted the media coverage of the two disasters and the ensuing civil emergencies to local and international media. His calm leadership throughout the emergency periods were noted for providing reassurance and hope to the people of Christchurch.\"\n\n\nParker has three sons from his first marriage, plus three grandchildren. His second marriage is to Joanna Nicholls-Parker.\n"}

The controversy was fueled by social media and crowdsourced investigations finding additional alleged infringement and plagiarism. The incident became an international topic of news and analysis, which expanded to become an internet meme. On the issue of copyright, the incident illustrates that \"masses of Internet users are very good at finding examples of copyright infringement, which counterbalances how easy the Internet has made plagiarism in the first place.\" At the same time, the response by the \"Cooks Source\" editor \"may well become a digital textbook example of how not to respond to grievances in the internet age.\" The incident was named Journalistic Error of the Year for 2010 by Craig Silverman on his website Regret the Error. The fallout from the controversy drove \"Cooks Source\" out of business within two weeks of it breaking in full.\n\nAs reported by Dan Crowley of the local \"Daily Hampshire Gazette\", \"Cooks Source\" was founded in 1997 by Judith D. Griggs, a former town planner and conservation agent, who had art directed and edited several small magazines previously. The magazine stated its goal was \"to help educate readers about sustainable sources of foods and products, farms, cooking, restaurants and businesses,\" and to provide a marketing tool for small businesses and farms which create and sell food for local businesses and consumers. At the time of the incident, \"Cooks Source\" was published by Cooks Source Publications in the second-floor office of a rented duplex in Sunderland, Massachusetts, almost north of Springfield. Griggs, who was 59 years old at the time of the incident, hand-delivered the monthly publication with her adult daughter along a 2,000-mile distribution route to locations in western New England, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont, and some of New Hampshire. The magazine's circulation varied, but it was under 10,000 a month.\n\nGriggs rose to internet notoriety on November 4, 2010, after it became known that an article published on page 10 in the October 2010 \"Cooks Source\" issue infringed on the copyright of Monica Gaudio, the piece's author. In 2005, Gaudio had published the copyrighted piece under the title \"A Tale of Two Tarts\" on a website devoted to medieval cookery.\n\nGaudio was credited in \"Cooks Source\" for the 1,300-word piece, which was retitled \"As American As Apple Pie — Isn't!\" and was revised from Gaudio's original in places. Griggs neither paid Gaudio nor notified her when the piece had run. Gaudio notified Griggs of the infringement and asked for an apology and a small donation to the Columbia School of Journalism. (Gaudio chose the Columbia School of Journalism so \"Cooks Source\" could easily comply with her request; she has stated that she is neither a journalist herself nor is she affiliated with that institution.) The ensuing response by Griggs \"has become the stuff of internet legend,\" and said in part:\n\nBut honestly Monica, the web is considered 'public domain' and you should be happy we just didn't 'lift' your whole article and put someone else's name on it! It happens a lot, clearly more than you are aware of, especially on college campuses, and the workplace. If you took offence and are unhappy, I am sorry, but you as a professional should know that the article we used written by you was in very bad need of editing, and is much better now than was originally. Now it will work well for your portfolio. For that reason, I have a bit of a difficult time with your requests for monetary gain, albeit for such a fine (and very wealthy!) institution. We put some time into rewrites, you should compensate me! I never charge young writers for advice or rewriting poorly written pieces, and have many who write for me... ALWAYS for free!\n\nGriggs' response, particularly her statement that all web content is considered public domain, was publicized by a number of online celebrities, including Nick Mamatas, Wil Wheaton, John Scalzi, Neil Gaiman, and Warren Ellis. The tone of Griggs' response and her erroneous claims led to what Gaudio described as \"nerd rage\". The magazine's Facebook page received a slew of mocking messages. In less than 24 hours, a list of the magazine's advertisers was generated and the advertisers contacted, with secondary campaigns begun to reward advertisers who had pulled their ads from the magazine. One blog campaigned for making \"griggs\" a verb meaning \"to take something without permission then demand compensation from the victim\". The hashtags #buthonestlymonica and #crookssource went viral on Twitter.\n\n\"Cooks Source\"s web hosting company, Intuit, experienced an outage on November 4, prompting speculation that a denial-of-service attack aimed at \"Cooks Source\" may have been the reason. Several parodic Twitter accounts and a bogus Facebook page titled \"Cooks Source Mag\" were created on November 5, containing additional inflammatory statements purportedly by the magazine staff. It also inspired editorials by Robert X. Cringely and John Birmingham, \"Downfall\" parodies, a tribute song, and a satirical proposed apology composed entirely of unattributed famous quotations. Cringely later named it fourth among the Top 10 Dumbest Tech Moves of 2010.\n\nGaudio said she never intended the online response to go as far as it had, but she expected mainstream media coverage once Gaiman re-tweeted it. She said she knew one or more \"Cooks Source\" advertisers had been contacted, but she did not intend for any small businesses or people to be harmed or harassed. She said she found many of the Facebook comments amusing.\n\nGaudio did not receive a direct response from Griggs or \"Cooks Source Magazine\" in relation to the affair after Gaudio posted about their email communication.\n\nOn November 9, the \"Cooks Source\" website was updated with an unsigned statement indicating \"Cooks Source\" had complied with Gaudio's requests for redress and were changing their business practices. Gaudio was unable to confirm immediately if the requested donation had in fact been made. Linda Holmes, a writer at NPR, characterized the statement as \"a very strange semi-apology\", adding, \"It actually sounds a lot like the e-mail Gaudio got in the first place: defiant, sure of its correctness, and, in the end, kind of baffling.\" \"New York\" declared the publication's apparent retention of Griggs \"a victory for passive-aggressive e-mail writers everywhere.\" The \"Cooks Source\" statement was quickly parodied and mocked. John Scalzi graded the apology a D+, adding, \"This is the apology of someone who is sorry she got caught, not the apology of someone who feels she has done wrong.\" Robert X. Cringely called the statement \"one of the oddest things I've ever read.\"\n\nIn her first interview after the incident, Griggs said she had received hundreds of emails and disconnected her phone after getting over 100 calls. Though the November issue was scheduled for delivery, Griggs said, \"I don't know if I'm going to continue \"Cooks Source\". At this point, it's looking doubtful.\" The article elaborated that \"Cooks Source\" commonly received cookbooks and recipes from publishers and that its content was routinely duplicated from those sources, sometimes with express permission. Shortly after the interview's publication, Gaudio was able to confirm Griggs' donation, and therefore considered the matter \"all resolved, at least to my satisfaction.\"\n\nOn November 17, 2010, the \"Cooks Source\" homepage was updated again, with a personal statement from Griggs which claimed Gaudio's email was \"antagonistic and just plain rude\", that Gaudio had neglected to post \"nice\" things Griggs had said in her email alongside the rude things, and that Griggs had offered to compensate Gaudio for the article, but that Gaudio \"never gave [her] a chance\" to address the issue. Griggs reiterated that she would likely close down \"Cooks Source\" due to the backlash. Gaudio responded by posting her side of her correspondence with Griggs; she explained that she was unable to post Griggs' portion of the email conversation due to Griggs holding copyright on her own words. The \"Cooks Source\" and \"Travel Source\" homepages were later taken offline completely, and Facebook deleted the related sites originally created by Griggs.\n\nThe incident prompted editorials from a range of journalists including Melissa Block of NPR's \"All Things Considered\", Zachary Hunchar of Technorati, and CNN's Eatocracy. Journalist Ivor Tossell opined that this may be the first major Facebook-based internet vigilantism where many participants used their real names instead of remaining anonymous. He noted that Griggs resembled a cartoonish \"pantomime villain\", and her passive-aggressive attitude, and not the infringement itself, caused the response. TechRepublic offered tips to avoid having one's online work used without credit. One author compared the incident to the 2008 sourcing dispute that led to the demise of \"The Bulletin\", a small Texas alternative weekly. Glenn Fleishman wrote that \"regardless of the provenance of the email, it was scary to watch the net awake as one.\"\n\nThe NPR program \"On the Media\" discussed the episode as an example of how quickly and severely anger can spread on the Internet, noting that the episode had made the phrase \"but honestly, Monica\" into an internet meme and had spawned the verb \"to Griggs\", defined as \"to use content on the Web without permission, then request payment from the original author for rewrites and editing.\" Paul Bradshaw reviewed professional options for Griggs that might have mitigated the impact of the negative response. Joseph P. Kahn used the \"Cooks Source\" incident to illustrate how senders should have no expectation of privacy once something is electronically transmitted to a recipient, especially if it is potentially controversial or embarrassing.\n\nAfter Gaudio posted Griggs' email, online investigators created a Google Spreadsheet and compiled almost 170 instances where \"Cooks Source\" appeared to have lifted copyrighted material, including text and images, from other sources, \"including NPR, Hallmark and the website of Food Network personality Paula Deen.\" Blogger Edward Champion contacted the original authors or publishers of several pieces published in \"Cooks Source\" and confirmed that many of them had been used without permission. NPR sent the magazine a cease-and-desist letter.\n\n"}

They are almost exclusively gentlemen, typically between the ages of 40 and 70, who excel in social ballroom dancing.\n\nMany cruise lines allocate cabins for dance host programs. Dance hosts are expected to socialize with passengers and dance with the female passengers, who happen to greatly outnumber male passengers on most cruises. Dance hosts must be present nightly at dance floor locations and \"work the room\", offering a dance to each unescorted female passenger, while being careful to not to show favoritism.\nThey are also responsible for attending all ship-sponsored parties and are often asked to host tables at dinner time. They serve as general companions, making conversation and joining in for shipboard activities and games. All the while, romance is not involved, so these gentlemen must have their wits and tact about them. Crossing another passenger's cabin threshold can result in disembarkation. The film Out to Sea, a comical interpretation of the position, is basically a guide of what \"not\" to do.\n\nIdeal applicants come from well travelled and well educated backgrounds who find it easy to converse on a variety of subjects. It is important that hosts have polished appearances and refined, approachable manners. They must also be in good shape, as dancing, most nights, lasts for hours.\nCruise lines usually allocate one passenger cabin for two hosts and allow a placement agency to charge a small daily fee. This covers the cost of recruiting, qualifying, and booking hosts for the cruise lines' itineraries. Qualification procedures include a background check, a dance audition with a local dance instructor or video audition, and a written biography with a photograph which can be used as an introduction and conversation starter once on board.\n\nA host must have an inherent love for dancing and socializing and not consider his responsibilities a job, because he'd be disappointed to learn that dance hosting is not a paid position. On the other hand, he will be sailing to exciting destinations on a luxury vessel for a small fraction of the ticket price that the regular guests pay. There are often perks associated with this position including paid airfare for some long sailings, discounts for laundry, bar tabs, and internet, and opportunities to serve as an escorts for shore excursions - which means they may join in on $150+ land-based itineraries for free.\n"}
{"id": "1815222", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1815222", "title": "Engelbrekt rebellion", "text": "Engelbrekt rebellion\n\nThe Engelbrekt rebellion was a rebellion in 1434–1436 led by Swedish miner and nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson against Eric of Pomerania, the king of the Kalmar Union. It resulted in the deposing of Eric and the erosion of the union.\n\nIn 1434, Sweden was part of the Kalmar Union, a personal union that united Sweden with Denmark and Norway under a single monarch, the current monarch being Eric of Pomerania. The Swedes were not happy with the Danes' frequent warfare on Schleswig, Holstein, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania, which disturbed Swedish exports (notably iron) to the Continent. During the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war, while the exports were brought to a halt, the collection of taxes continued, enraging Swedish peasants. Furthermore, the centralization of government in Denmark raised suspicions. The Swedish Privy Council wanted to retain a fair degree of self-government.\n\nThe rebellion was ignited by the tax situation, where Eric showed arrogance by not negotiating with the four Estates of the Swedish realm at a Diet.\n\nIn the summer of 1434, enraged miners and peasants burned the castle of Borganäs near Borlänge. The tension spread, causing several assaults on castles across the country. Nobleman Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson with mining interests in the Bergslagen area stood out as the rebel leader, commanding a peasant army. Negotiations with Eric took place in Vadstena in August 1434, but were unsuccessful.\n\nIn January 1435 Engelbrekt summoned representatives from the four Estates to a Diet in Arboga, which later has been called the first Riksdag of the Estates (although it is uncertain whether the peasants really participated). Engelbrekt was elected Captain (\"Rikshövitsman\") of the Swedish realm. The antagonism abated when Eric promised changes for the better. However, as before, people felt these promises were not being fulfilled, hence the rebels picked up their axes once more. On April 27, 1436, a rebel army unit was sent marching towards Stockholm, where people still supported Eric due to the strong and influential Danish presence in the city.\n\nA certain degree of inner tension among the rebelling forces occurred because the Nobility and Clergy decided to support Karl Knutsson Bonde, who in 1436 had risen to the position of \"Rikshövitsman\". Neither dared remove Engelbrekt completely because of his strong support among the two lower Estates (Burghers and Peasants). However, Engelbrekt fell sick and became less active. In a twist of fate highly beneficial to Knutsson, Engelbrekt was assassinated on May 4 by Måns Bengtsson (Natt och Dag), the cause being an unrelated personal conflict. Consequently, Knutsson won the power struggle (and became King Charles VIII of Sweden in 1448). A man named Erik Puke attempted to rally Engelbrekt's old supporters in the \"Pukefejden\", but it was too late. Puke was apprehended and executed in Stockholm in 1437.\n\nThe Engelbrekt rebellion caused the unity of the Kalmar Union to erode, leading to the expulsion of Danish forces from Sweden. Although later Danish kings regained influence over Sweden, the rebellion had set a precedent for Swedish claims to sovereignty. It also set a precedent for peasants to engage actively in Swedish politics; in the future power claimants always took pains to appeal to peasant and peasant interests.\n\nFurthermore, where it is uncertain whether all four Estates participated in the Diet (\"Riksdag\") in Arboga, this was in fact the case in 1436, when a Diet was held in Uppsala following the death of Engelbrekt. Thus, the Engelbrekt rebellion marked the start of a democratic institution which to a certain extent included the peasants.\n"}

{"id": "66154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=66154", "title": "Festival of Britain", "text": "Festival of Britain\n\nThe Festival of Britain was a national exhibition and fair that reached millions of visitors throughout the United Kingdom in the summer of 1951. Historian Kenneth O. Morgan says the Festival was a \"triumphant success\" as people:\n\nLabour cabinet member Herbert Morrison was the prime mover; in 1947 he started with the original plan to celebrate the centennial of the Great Exhibition of 1851. However it was not to be another World Fair, for international themes were absent, as was the British Commonwealth. Instead the 1951 festival focused entirely on Britain and its achievements; it was funded chiefly by the government, with a budget of £12 million. The Labour government was losing support and so the implicit goal of the festival was to give the people a feeling of successful recovery from the war's devastation , as well as promoting British science, technology, industrial design, architecture and the arts. \n\nThe Festival's centrepiece was in London on the South Bank of the Thames. There were events in Poplar (Architecture), Battersea (The Festival Pleasure Gardens), South Kensington (Science) and Glasgow (Industrial Power). Festival celebrations took place in Cardiff, Stratford-upon-Avon, Bath, Perth, Bournemouth, York, Aldeburgh, Inverness, Cheltenham, Oxford, Norwich, Canterbury and elsewhere and there were touring exhibitions by land and sea. \n\nThe Festival became a \"beacon for change\" that proved immensely popular with thousands of elite visitors and millions of popular ones. It helped reshape British arts, crafts, designs and sports for a generation. Journalist Harry Hopkins highlights the widespread impact of the \"Festival style\". They called it \"Contemporary\". It was:\n\nThe first idea for an exhibition in 1951 came from the Royal Society of Arts in 1943, which considered that an international exhibition should be held to commemorate the centenary of the 1851 Great Exhibition. In 1945, the government appointed a committee under Lord Ramsden to consider how exhibitions and fairs could promote exports. When the committee reported a year later, it was decided not to continue with the idea of an international exhibition because of its cost at a time when reconstruction was a high priority. Herbert Morrison took charge for the Labour government and decided instead to hold a series of displays about the arts, architecture, science, technology and industrial design, under the title \"Festival of Britain 1951\". Morrison insisted there be no politics, explicit or implicit. As a result Labour-sponsored programs such as nationalisation, universal health care and working class housing were excluded; instead what was allowed was town planning, scientific progress, and all sorts of traditional and modern arts and crafts.\n\nMuch of London lay in ruins and models of redevelopment were needed. The Festival was an attempt to give Britons a feeling of recovery and progress and to promote better-quality design in the rebuilding of British towns and cities. The Festival of Britain described itself as \"one united act of national reassessment, and one corporate reaffirmation of faith in the nation's future.\" Gerald Barry, the Festival Director, described it as \"a tonic to the nation\".\n\nA Festival Council to advise the government was set up under General Lord Ismay. Responsibility for organisation devolved upon the Lord President of the Council, Herbert Morrison, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, who had been London County Council leader. He appointed a Great Exhibition Centenary Committee, consisting of civil servants, who were to define the framework of the Festival and to liaise between government departments and the festival organisation. In March 1948, a Festival Headquarters was set up, which was to be the nucleus of the Festival of Britain Office, a government department with its own budget. Festival projects in Northern Ireland were undertaken by the government of Northern Ireland.\n\nAssociated with the Festival of Britain Office were the Arts Council of Great Britain, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Book League. In addition, a Council for Architecture and a Council for Science and Technology were specially created to advise the Festival Organisation and a Committee of Christian Churches was set up to advise on religion. Government grants were made to the Arts Council, the Council of Industrial Design, the British Film Institute and the National Museum of Wales for work undertaken as part of the Festival.\n\nGerald Barry had operational charge. A long-time editor with left-leaning, middle-brow views, he was energetic and optimistic, with an eye for what would be popular, and a knack on how to motivate others. Unlike Morrison, Barry was not seen as a Labour ideologue. Barry selected the next rank, giving preference to young architects and designers who had collaborated on exhibitions for the wartime Ministry of Information. They thought along the same lines socially and aesthetically, as middle-class intellectuals with progressive sympathies. Thanks to Barry a collegial sentiments prevailed that minimised stress and delay.\nThe arts were displayed in a series of country-wide musical and dramatic performances. Achievements in architecture were to presented in a new neighbourhood, the Lansbury Estate, planned, built and occupied in the Poplar district of London.\n\nThe Festival's centrepiece was the South Bank Exhibition, in the Waterloo area of London, which demonstrated the contribution made by British advances in science, technology and industrial design, displayed, in their practical and applied form, against a background representing the living, working world of the day.\n\nThere were other displays elsewhere, each intended to be complete in itself, yet each part of the one single conception. Festival Pleasure Gardens were set up in Battersea, about three miles up river from the South Bank. Heavy engineering was the subject of an Exhibition of Industrial Power in Glasgow. Certain aspects of science, which did not fall within the terms of reference of the South Bank Exhibition, were displayed in South Kensington. Linen technology and science in agriculture were exhibited in \"Farm and Factory\" in Belfast. A smaller exhibition of the South Bank story was put on in the Festival ship \"Campania\", which toured the coast of Britain throughout the summer of 1951, and on land there was a travelling exhibition of industrial design.\n\nThe University of Brighton Design Archives have digitised many of the Design Council's files relating to the planning of the festival.\n\nExhibitions\n\nFestival Pleasure Gardens, Battersea Park, London\n\nLondon Season of the Arts\n\nArts Festivals\n\nPageant of Wales, Sophia Gardens, Cardiff\n\nSt Fagan's Folk Festival, Cardiff\n\nWelsh Hillside Farm Scheme, Dolhendre\n\nArts Festivals\n\nExhibitions\n\nArts Festivals\n\nGathering of the Clans, Edinburgh\n\nUlster Farm and Factory, Belfast\n\nArts Festival\n\nFestival Ship \"Campania\",: England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\n\nLand Travelling Exhibition : England\n\nConstruction of the South Bank site opened up a new public space, including a riverside walkway, where previously there had been warehouses and working-class housing. The layout of the South Bank site was intended to showcase the principles of urban design that would feature in the post-war rebuilding of London and the creation of the new towns. These included multiple levels of buildings, elevated walkways and avoidance of a street grid. Most of the South Bank buildings were International Modernist in style, little seen in Britain before the war.\n\nThe architecture and display of the South Bank Exhibition were planned by the Festival Office's Exhibition Presentation Panel, whose members were:\n\n\nThe theme of the Exhibition was devised by Ian Cox.\n\nThe Exhibition comprised the Upstream Circuit: \"The Land\", the Dome of Discovery, the Downstream Circuit: \"The People\", and other displays.\n\n\"Architect\": Misha Black\n\"Theme\": Ian Cox\n\"Display Design\": James Holland\n\nThe exhibits comprised:\n\n\"Architect\": Ralph Tubbs\n\"Theme\": Ian Cox\n\"Display\": Design Research Unit\n\nThe exhibits focused on scientific discovery. They included:\n\n\"Architect\": Hugh Casson\n\"Theme\": M.Hartland Thomas\n\"Display Design\": James Gardner\n\nThe exhibits comprised:\n\n\nAn unusual cigar-shaped aluminium-clad steel tower supported by cables, the Skylon was the “Vertical Feature” that was an abiding symbol of the Festival of Britain. The base was nearly 15 metres (50 feet) from the ground, with the top nearly 90 metres (300 feet) high. The frame was clad in aluminium louvres lit from within at night. It was designed by Hidalgo Moya, Philip Powell and Felix Samuely, and fabricated by Painter Brothers of Hereford, England, between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. It had a steel latticework frame, pointed at both ends and supported on cables slung between three steel beams. The partially constructed Skylon was rigged vertically, then grew taller in situ. The architects' design was made possible by the engineer Felix Samuely who, at the time, was a lecturer at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square, Bloomsbury. The Skylon was scrapped in 1952 on the orders of Winston Churchill, who saw it as a symbol of the preceding Labour Government. It was demolished and sold for scrap after being toppled into the Thames.\n\nDesigned by Leslie Martin, Peter Moro and Robert Matthew from the LCC's Architects' Department and built by Holland, Hannen & Cubitts for London County Council. The foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Clement Attlee 1949 on the site of the former Lion Brewery, built in 1837. Martin was 39 when he was appointed to lead the design team in late 1948. He designed the structure as an 'egg in a box', a term he used to describe the separation of the curved auditorium space from the surrounding building and the noise and vibration of the adjacent railway viaduct. Sir Thomas Beecham used similar imagery, calling the building a \"giant chicken coop\". The building was officially opened on 3 May 1951. The inaugural concerts were conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and Sir Adrian Boult. In April 1988 it was designated a Grade I listed building, the first post-war building to become so protected.\n\n\nThe Festival Pleasure Gardens were created as the lighter side of the Festival of Britain. They were put up in Battersea Park, a few miles from the South Bank Exhibition. They included:\n\n\nMost of the buildings and pavilions on the site were designed by John Piper.\" There was also a \"Guinness Festival Clock\". The Pleasure Gardens received as many visitors as the South Bank Festival. They were managed by a specially-formed private company financed by loans from the Festival Office and the London County Council. As they failed to cover their costs, it was decided to keep them open after the rest of the Festival closed.\n\nThe Festival architects tried to show by the design and layout of the South Bank Festival what could be achieved by applying modern town planning ideas. The Festival Style, (also called \"Contemporary\") combining modernism with whimsy and Englishness, influenced architecture, interior design, product design and typography in the 1950s. William Feaver describes the Festival Style as \"Braced legs, indoor plants, lily-of-the valley sprays of lightbulbs, aluminium lattices, Costswold-type walling with picture windows, flying staircases, blond wood, the thorn, the spike, the molecule.\" The influence of the Festival Style was felt in the new towns, coffee bars and office blocks of the fifties. Harlow new town and the rebuilding of Coventry city centre are said to show the influence of the Festival Style \"in their light structures, picturesque layout and incorporation of works of art\", and Coventry Cathedral (1962), designed by Basil Spence, one of the Festival architects, was dubbed \"The Festival of Britain at Prayer\".\n\nThere was an exhibition about building research, town planning and architecture, the \"Live architecture\" exhibit of buildings, open spaces and streets in the Lansbury Estate, Poplar (named after the former Labour Party leader George Lansbury. Plans for social housing in the area had commenced in 1943. By the end of the war nearly a quarter of the buildings in the area had been destroyed or badly damaged. In 1948, the Architecture Council decided that the Poplar site would make a good exhibition partly because it was near to the other Festival exhibitions. Despite funding problems, work began in December 1949 and by May 1950 was well advanced. The wet winter of 1950–51 delayed work, but the first houses were completed and occupied by February 1951. The exhibition opened on 3 May 1951 along with the other Festival exhibitions. Visitors first went to the Building Research Pavilion, which displayed housing problems and their solutions, then to the Town Planning Pavilion, a large, red-and-white striped tent. The Town Planning Pavilion demonstrated the principles of town planning and the urgent need for new towns, including a mock up of an imaginary town called \"Avoncaster\". Visitors then saw the buildings of the Lansbury Estate. Attendance was disappointing, only 86,426 people visiting, compared to 8 million who visited the South Bank exhibition. Reaction to the development by industry professionals was lukewarm, some criticising its small scale Subsequent local authorities concentrated on high rise, high density social housing rather than the Lansbury estate model. The estate remains popular with residents. Among the remaining 1951 buildings are Trinity Independent Chapel, and The Festival Inn and Festive Briton (now Callaghans) pubs.\n\nMisha Black, one of the Festival architects, said that the Festival created a wide audience for architectural modernism but that it was common currency among professional architects that the design of the Festival was not innovative. The design writer Reyner Banham has questioned the originality and the Englishness of the Festival Style and indeed the extent of its influence. Young architects in 1951 are said to have despised the Festival of Britain for its architecture. \"It was equated with the ‘Contemporary Style’, and an editorial on New Brutalism in \"Architectural Design\" in 1955 carried the epigraph, ‘When I hear the word “Contemporary” I reach for my revolver.’\"\n\nThe South Bank Exhibition included a Design Review that presented \"an illustrated record of contemporary achievement in British industry\", showing \"the high standard of design and craftsmanship that has been reached in a wide range of British products.\" The exhibits were based on the stock list of the Council of Industrial Design (CoID) and were chosen for appearance, finish, workmanship, technical efficiency, fitness for purpose and economy of production. In selecting and promoting designs in this way, the Festival was an influential advocate of the concept of \"Good Design\", a rational approach to product design in accordance with the principles of the Modern Movement. Its advocacy of Good Design had grown partly out of the standards of utility furniture created during the war (Gordon Russell, the Director of the CoID, had been Chairman of the Utility Furniture Design Panel) and partly out of the CoID's Britain Can Make It exhibition of 1946. The CoiD's stock list was retained and inherited by its successor, the Design Council.\n\nDesign, science and industry came together in the Festival Pattern Group, which commissioned textiles, wallpaper, domestic objects and Festival exhibits based on x-ray crystallography. The idea of using the molecular patterns revealed in x-ray crystallography in surface patterns was first suggested by Dr Helen Megaw, a leading Cambridge University crystallographer. After hearing a presentation by Dorothy Hodgkin to the Society of Industrial Artists, Mark Hartland Thomas, chief industrial officer of the CoID, took up the idea and formed the Festival Pattern Group. Hartland Thomas was a member of the Festival of Britain Presentation Panel and was co-ordinating the CoID's stock list. He secured the Regatta Restaurant, one of the temporary restaurants on the South Bank, for an experiment in pattern design based on the crystal structure of haemoglobin, insulin, wareite, china clay, mica and other molecules, which were used for the surface patterns of the restaurant furnishings. The designs that were sponsored by the Festival Pattern Group chimed in with displays in the Dome of Discovery about the structure of matter and the Festival's emphasis on progress, science and technology\n\nLettering and type design featured prominently in the graphic style of the Festival and was overseen by a typography panel including the lettering historian Nicolete Gray. A typeface for the Festival, Festival Titling, was specially commissioned and designed by Philip Boydell. It was based on condensed sans-serif capitals and had a three-dimensional form making it suitable for use in exhibition display typography. It has been said to bear \"a vague resemblance to bunting\". The lettering on the Royal Festival Hall and the temporary Festival building on the South Bank was a bold, sloping slab serif letter form, determined by Gray and her colleagues, including Charles Hasler and Gordon Cullen, illustrated in Gray’s \"Lettering on Buildings\" (1960) and derived in part from typefaces used in the early 19th century. It has been described as a \"turn to a jauntier and more decorative visual language\" that was \"part of a wider move towards the appreciation of vernacular arts and the peculiarities of English culture\". The lettering in the Lion and Unicorn Pavilion was designed by John Brinkley.\n\nThe graphic designer for the Festival was Abram Games, who created its emblem, the Festival Star.\n\nThe South Bank Exhibition showed the work of contemporary artists such as William Scott, including murals by Victor Pasmore, John Tunnard, Feliks Topolski and John Piper and sculptures by Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Lynn Chadwick, Jacob Epstein and Reg Butler.\n\nArts festivals were held throughout the summer as part of the Festival of Britain:\n\nThe London Season of the Arts comprised exhibitions specially arranged for the Festival of Britain. They included:\n\nBarbara Jones and Tom Ingram organised \"Black Eyes and Lemonade\", an exhibition of British popular and traditional art, in association with the Society for Education in Art and the Arts Council. In the same year she surveyed the popular arts in her influential book, \"The Unsophisticated Arts\", which included taxidermy, fairgrounds, canal boats, seaside, riverside, tattooing, the decoration of food, waxworks, toys, rustic work, shops, festivals and funerals. She said of the popular arts,\" some of it is made for themselves by people without professional training in the arts or in the appreciation of them, and some of it has been made for those people by professionals who work to their taste.\"\n\nThe Festival was the occasion of the first performance of steelpan music in Britain by the Trinidad All Steel Percussion Orchestra.\n\nThe British Film Institute was asked by Herbert Morrison in 1948 to consider the contribution that film could make to the Festival. It set up a panel including Michael Balcon, Antony Asquith, John Grierson, Harry Watt and Arthur Elston, which became a committee of sponsorship and distribution. Over a dozen sponsored documentary films were made for the Festival, including,\n\n\nSeveral feature films were planned, but only one was completed in time, \"The Magic Box\", a biographical film about cinema pioneer William Friese-Greene, made by Festival Film Productions.\n\nThere was a purpose-built film theatre on the South Bank, the Telecinema (sometimes called the \"Telekinema\"), designed by Wells Coates, which showed documentary and experimental film exploiting stereophony and stereoscopy and the new invention of television. It was one of the most popular attractions of the Festival, with 458,693 visitors. When the Festival ended, the Telecinema was handed over to the BFI for use as a members-only repertory cinema club, re-opening in 1952 as the National Film Theatre.\n\nFilm was integral to the South Bank Exhibition, used to explain manufacturing, science and technology. The Dome of Discovery, the Exhibition of Science in South Kensington and the travelling Festival Exhibition made extensive use of educational and explanatory film.\n\nFilm festivals, including those at Edinburgh Film Festival, Bath and Glasgow participated in the Festival of Britain, and local authorities put on film festivals, helped by a BFI pamphlet, \"How to put on a Film Show\".\n\nCommercial cinema chains and independent cinemas also joined in, the Gaumont and Odeon chains programming seasons of British films. \"And finally, if the Festival visitor had not tired of the medium, they could purchase colour 16mm film of Britain’s historic buildings and pageantry and filmstrips of the Festival of Britain and London as souvenirs.\"\n\nOne of the British Broadcasting Corporation's contributions to the Festival was a television musical called \"The Golden Year\", broadcast on 23 June and 2 July. T\n\nA new wing was built for the Science Museum to hold the \"Exhibition of Science\". The first part of the exhibition showed the physical and chemical nature of matter and the behaviour of elements and molecules. The second part, \"The Structure of Living Things\", dealt with plants and animals. The third part, \"Stop Press\", showed some of the latest topics of research in science and their emergence from the ideas illustrated in the earlier sections of the exhibition. They included \"the penetrating rays which reach us from outer space, what goes on in space and in the stars, and a range of subjects from the electronic brain to the processes and structures on which life is based.\"\n\nThere were hundreds of events associated with the Festival, some of which were:\n\nThe Festival was highly popular in every part of Britain. Richard Weight estimates that of the national population of 49 million, about half participated. The Festival largely ignored foreign tourists, with most of the visitors from the Continent being expatriate Britons.\n\nThere were over ten million paid admissions to the six main exhibitions over a period of five months: The most popular event was the centerpiece at South Bank Exhibition with almost 8.5 million visitors, over half of them from outside London. The Festival Pleasure Gardens had over 8 million visitors, three-quarters of them from London. The Festival Ship Campania, which docked in ten cities, was visited by almost 900,000 people. The Travelling Land Exhibition, which went to four English cities, attracted under half a million. The most specialised events, in terms of attracting few visitors, were the architecture exhibition in Poplar, with 87,000 visitors and the exhibition of books in South Kensington, with 63,000.\n\nThe idea of holding the Festival became a party political issue. Although Herbert Morrison said that he did not want the Festival to be seen as a political venture, it became associated with the Labour Party, which had won the 1950 general election, and it was opposed by the Conservative Party. Hugh Casson said that, \"Churchill, like the rest of the Tory Party, was against the Festival which they (quite rightly) believed was the advanced guard of socialism.\" Churchill referred to the forthcoming Festival of Britain as \"three-dimensional Socialist propaganda.\"\n\nIn an essay on the Festival, Michael Frayn characterised it as an enterprise of \"the radical middle-classes, the do-gooders; the readers of the \"News Chronicle\", \"The Guardian\", and \"The Observer\"; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the B.B.C.,\" whom he called \"Herbivores\". In Frayn's view, \"The Festival was the last, and virtually the posthumous, work of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the Crown Film Unit, the sweet ration, the Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac, Sylvia Peters.\" In making the Festival the Herbivores \"earned the contempt of the Carnivores – the readers of the \"Daily Express\"; the Evelyn Waughs; the cast of the Directory of Directors\".\n\nSome prominent members of the Labour government considered the Festival to be a Labour undertaking which would contribute to their future electoral success, and Clement Attlee, the Labour Leader, wrote to Morrison saying that an election in autumn 1951 would enable the Labour Party to benefit from its popularity. In the event, Labour lost the autumn election. Churchill's contempt for the Festival led him to make his first act as Prime Minister in October 1951 an instruction to clear the South Bank site.\n\nThe \"Guide Book\" to the Festival described its legacy in these words: \"It will leave behind not just a record of what we have thought of ourselves in the year 1951 but, in a fair community founded where once there was a slum, in an avenue of trees or in some work of art, a reminder of what we have done to write this single, adventurous year into our national and local history.\"\n\nWhile the idea of the Festival was being worked out, the government and the London County Council were at the same time planning the redevelopment of the South Bank site, including \"a number of great buildings, which will form part of a co-ordinated design.\" The first of these was the Royal Festival Hall. The Festival hastened the reclamation of four and a half acres of land from the river, which \"transformed the familiar patchwork of rubble and half-derelict buildings which had for so long monopolised the propect from the North Bank\". The Festival site was, over the following thirty years, developed into the South Bank Centre, an arts complex comprising the Royal Festival Hall, the National Film Theatre, the Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Purcell Room and the National Theatre.\n\nA 1951 office building at 219 Oxford Street, London, designed by Ronald Ward and Partners (now a Grade II* listed building), incorporates images of the Festival on its facade.\n\nThe Festival cost about £10.5 million, (apart from the loans for the Festival Gardens) with revenues of about £2.5m. The net cost was £8 million (equivalent to £ million today).\n\nIn 1953 the Festival of Britain Office was abolished and its records were taken over by the Ministry of Works.\n\nAs well as the material legacy, the Festival gave rise to new traditions, in particular the performances of medieval mystery plays in York and Chester. There was an explosion of interest in these plays, regular performance of which have continued in those cities ever since.\n\nSeveral images of the South Bank Exhibition can be found on the internet, including many released by The National Archives on the 60th anniversary of the festival.\n\nA filmed retrospective of the South Bank Exhibition, \"Brief City\" (1952), with special reference to design and architecture, was made by Richard Massingham for \"The Observer\" newspaper. A film comedy, \"The Happy Family\", was made about working-class resistance to the demolition that the festival required. The Festival is featured in the early portion of the film \"Prick up your Ears\".\n\nThe archive of the Design Council held at the University of Brighton Design Archives includes several hundred images of the festival. They can be searched via the Visual Arts Data Service (VADS).\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

She retrieved 750 drawers from dressers, kitchen cabinets, desks and bureaus. The empty drawers were cleaned, and the addresses of the houses were marked on the back. Napoli stated that \"\"Floodwall\" was made in an attempt to give voice to the silence of a city in ruin and a people in diaspora.\"\n\nThe contents that remained were then photographed.

{"id": "147685", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=147685", "title": "Geomagnetic storm", "text": "Geomagnetic storm\n\nA geomagnetic storm (commonly referred to as a solar storm) is a temporary disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave and/or cloud of magnetic field that interacts with the Earth's magnetic field. The increase in the solar wind pressure initially compresses the magnetosphere. The solar wind's magnetic field interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field and transfers an increased energy into the magnetosphere. Both interactions cause an increase in plasma movement through the magnetosphere (driven by increased electric fields inside the magnetosphere) and an increase in electric current in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.\n\nDuring the main phase of a geomagnetic storm, electric current in the magnetosphere creates a magnetic force that pushes out the boundary between the magnetosphere and the solar wind. The disturbance in the interplanetary medium that drives the storm may be due to a solar coronal mass ejection (CME) or a high speed stream (co-rotating interaction region or CIR) of the solar wind originating from a region of weak magnetic field on the Sun's surface. The frequency of geomagnetic storms increases and decreases with the sunspot cycle. CME driven storms are more common during the maximum of the solar cycle, while CIR driven storms are more common during the minimum of the solar cycle.\n\nSeveral space weather phenomena tend to be associated with or are caused by a geomagnetic storm. These include solar energetic particle (SEP) events, geomagnetically induced currents (GIC), ionospheric disturbances that cause radio and radar scintillation, disruption of navigation by magnetic compass and auroral displays at much lower latitudes than normal. In 1989, a geomagnetic storm energized ground induced currents that disrupted electric power distribution throughout most of the province of Quebec and caused aurorae as far south as Texas.\n\nIn 1931, Sydney Chapman and Vincenzo C. A. Ferraro wrote an article, \"A New Theory of Magnetic Storms\", that sought to explain the phenomenon. They argued that whenever the Sun emits a solar flare it also emits a plasma cloud\",\" now known as a coronal mass ejection. They wrote that this plasma travels at a velocity such that it reaches Earth within 113 days, though we now know this journey takes 1 to 5 days. They wrote that the cloud then compresses the Earth's magnetic field and thus increases this field at the Earth's surface.\n\nA geomagnetic storm is defined by changes in the Dst (disturbance – storm time) index. The Dst index estimates the globally averaged change of the horizontal component of the Earth’s magnetic field at the magnetic equator based on measurements from a few magnetometer stations. Dst is computed once per hour and reported in near-real-time. During quiet times, Dst is between +20 and −20 nano-Tesla (nT).\n\nA geomagnetic storm has three phases: initial, main and recovery. The initial phase is characterized by Dst (or its one-minute component SYM-H) increasing by 20 to 50 nT in tens of minutes. The initial phase is also referred to as a storm sudden commencement (SSC). However, not all geomagnetic storms have an initial phase and not all sudden increases in Dst or SYM-H are followed by a geomagnetic storm. The main phase of a geomagnetic storm is defined by Dst decreasing to less than −50 nT. The selection of −50 nT to define a storm is somewhat arbitrary. The minimum value during a storm will be between -50 and approximately -600 nT. The duration of the main phase is typically 2–8 hours. The recovery phase is when Dst changes from its minimum value to its quiet time value. The recovery phase may last as short as 8 hours or as long as 7 days.\n\nThe size of a geomagnetic storm is classified as moderate (−50 nT > minimum of Dst > −100 nT), intense (−100 nT > minimum Dst > −250 nT) or super-storm (minimum of Dst < −250 nT).\n\nThe first scientific observation of the effects of a geomagnetic storm occurred early in the 19th century: From May 1806 until June 1807, Alexander von Humboldt recorded the bearing of a magnetic compass in Berlin. On 21 December 1806, he noticed that his compass had become erratic during a bright auroral event.\n\nOn September 1–2, 1859, the largest recorded geomagnetic storm occurred. From August 28 until September 2, 1859, numerous sunspots and solar flares were observed on the Sun, with the largest flare on September 1. This is referred to as the Solar storm of 1859 or the Carrington Event. It can be assumed that a massive coronal mass ejection (CME) was launched from the Sun and reached the Earth within eighteen hours—a trip that normally takes three to four days. The horizontal field was reduced by 1600 nT as recorded by the Colaba Observatory. It is estimated that Dst would have been approximately −1760 nT. Telegraph wires in both the United States and Europe experienced induced voltage increases (emf), in some cases even delivering shocks to telegraph operators and igniting fires. Aurorae were seen as far south as Hawaii, Mexico, Cuba and Italy—phenomena that are usually only visible in polar regions. Ice cores show evidence that events of similar intensity recur at an average rate of approximately once per 500 years.\n\nSince 1859, less severe storms have occurred, notably the aurora of November 17, 1882 and the May 1921 geomagnetic storm, both with disruption of telegraph service and initiation of fires, and 1960, when widespread radio disruption was reported.\n\nIn early August 1972, a series of flares and solar storms peaks with a flare estimated around X20 producing the fastest CME transit ever recorded and a severe geomagnetic and proton storm that disrupted terrestrial electrical and communications networks, as well as satellites (at least one made permanently inoperative), and unintentionally detonated numerous U.S. Navy magnetic-influence sea mines in North Vietnam.\n\nThe March 1989 geomagnetic storm caused the collapse of the Hydro-Québec power grid in seconds as equipment protection relays tripped in a cascading sequence. Six million people were left without power for nine hours. The storm caused auroras as far south as Texas. The storm causing this event was the result of a coronal mass ejected from the Sun on March 9, 1989. The minimum of Dst was −589 nT.\n\nOn July 14, 2000, an X5 class flare erupted (known as the Bastille Day event) and a coronal mass was launched directly at the Earth. A geomagnetic super storm occurred on July 15–17; the minimum of the Dst index was -301 nT. Despite the storm's strength, no power distribution failures were reported. The Bastille Day event was observed by Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, thus it is the farthest out in the Solar System that a solar storm has been observed.\n\nSeventeen major flares erupted on the Sun between 19 October and 5 November 2003, including perhaps the most intense flare ever measured on the GOES XRS sensor—a huge X28 flare, resulting in an extreme radio blackout, on 4 November. These flares were associated with CME events that caused three geomagnetic storms between 29 October and 2 November, during which the second and third storms were initiated before the previous storm period had fully recovered. The minimum Dst values were −151, −353 and −383 nT. Another storm in this sequence occurred on 4–5 November with a minimum Dst of −69 nT. The last geomagnetic storm was weaker than the preceding storms, because the active region on the Sun had rotated beyond the meridian where the central portion CME created during the flare event passed to the side of the Earth. The whole sequence became known as the Halloween Solar Storm. The Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) operated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was offline for approximately 30 hours due to the storm. The Japanese ADEOS-2 satellite was severely damaged and the operation of many other satellites were interrupted due to the storm.\n\nThe solar wind also carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. This field will have either a North or South orientation. If the solar wind has energetic bursts, contracting and expanding the magnetosphere, or if the solar wind takes a southward polarization, geomagnetic storms can be expected. The southward field causes magnetic reconnection of the dayside magnetopause, rapidly injecting magnetic and particle energy into the Earth's magnetosphere.\n\nDuring a geomagnetic storm, the ionosphere's F layer becomes unstable, fragments, and may even disappear. In the northern and southern pole regions of the Earth, auroras are observable.\n\nMagnetometers monitor the auroral zone as well as the equatorial region. Two types of radar, coherent scatter and incoherent scatter, are used to probe the auroral ionosphere. By bouncing signals off ionospheric irregularities, which move with the field lines, one can trace their motion and infer magnetospheric convection.\n\nSpacecraft instruments include:\n\n\nComputers have made it possible to bring together decades of isolated magnetic observations and extract average patterns of electrical currents and average responses to interplanetary variations. They also run simulations of the global magnetosphere and its responses, by solving the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a numerical grid. Appropriate extensions must be added to cover the inner magnetosphere, where magnetic drifts and ionospheric conduction need to be taken into account. So far the results are difficult to interpret, and certain assumptions are needed to cover small-scale phenomena.\n\nIt has been suggested that a geomagnetic storm on the scale of the solar storm of 1859 today would cause billions or even trillions of dollars of damage to satellites, power grids and radio communications, and could cause electrical blackouts on a massive scale that might not be repaired for weeks, months, or even years.\n\nWhen magnetic fields move about in the vicinity of a conductor such as a wire, a geomagnetically induced current is produced in the conductor. This happens on a grand scale during geomagnetic storms (the same mechanism also influenced telephone and telegraph lines before fiber optics, see above) on all long transmission lines. Long transmission lines (many kilometers in length) are thus subject to damage by this effect. Notably, this chiefly includes operators in China, North America, and Australia, especially in modern high-voltage, low-resistance lines. The European grid consists mainly of shorter transmission circuits, which are less vulnerable to damage.\n\nThe (nearly direct) currents induced in these lines from geomagnetic storms are harmful to electrical transmission equipment, especially transformers—inducing core saturation, constraining their performance (as well as tripping various safety devices), and causing coils and cores to heat up. In extreme cases, this heat can disable or destroy them, even inducing a chain reaction that can overload transformers. Most generators are connected to the grid via transformers, isolating them from the induced currents on the grid, making them much less susceptible to damage due to geomagnetically induced current. However, a transformer that is subjected to this will act as an unbalanced load to the generator, causing negative sequence current in the stator and consequently rotor heating.\n\nAccording to a study by Metatech corporation, a storm with a strength comparable to that of 1921 would destroy more than 300 transformers and leave over 130 million people without power in the United States, costing several trillion dollars. The Daily Mail even claims that a massive solar flare could knock out electric power for months, but these predictions are contradicted by a NERC report that concludes that a geomagnetic storm would cause temporary grid instability but no widespread destruction of high-voltage transformers. The report points out that the widely quoted Quebec grid collapse was not caused by overheating transformers but by the near-simultaneous tripping of seven relays.\n\nBesides the transformers being vulnerable to the effects of a geomagnetic storm, electricity companies can also be affected indirectly by the geomagnetic storm. For instance, internet service providers may go down during geomagnetic storms (and/or remain non-operational long after). Electricity companies may have equipment requiring a working internet connection to function, so during the period the internet service provider is down, the electricity too may not be distributed.\n\nBy receiving geomagnetic storm alerts and warnings (e.g. by the Space Weather prediction Center; via Space Weather satellites as SOHO or ACE), power companies can minimize damage to power transmission equipment, by momentarily disconnecting transformers or by inducing temporary blackouts. Preventative measures also exist, including preventing the inflow of GICs into the grid through the neutral-to-ground connection.\n\nHigh frequency (3–30 MHz) communication systems use the ionosphere to reflect radio signals over long distances. Ionospheric storms can affect radio communication at all latitudes. Some frequencies are absorbed and others are reflected, leading to rapidly fluctuating signals and unexpected propagation paths. TV and commercial radio stations are little affected by solar activity, but ground-to-air, ship-to-shore, shortwave broadcast and amateur radio (mostly the bands below 30 MHz) are frequently disrupted. Radio operators using HF bands rely upon solar and geomagnetic alerts to keep their communication circuits up and running.\n\nMilitary detection or early warning systems operating in the high frequency range are also affected by solar activity. The \"over-the-horizon radar\" bounces signals off the ionosphere to monitor the launch of aircraft and missiles from long distances. During geomagnetic storms, this system can be severely hampered by radio clutter. Also some submarine detection systems use the magnetic signatures of submarines as one input to their locating schemes. Geomagnetic storms can mask and distort these signals.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration routinely receives alerts of solar radio bursts so that they can recognize communication problems and avoid unnecessary maintenance. When an aircraft and a ground station are aligned with the Sun, high levels of noise can occur on air-control radio frequencies. This can also happen on UHF and SHF satellite communications, when an Earth station, a satellite and the Sun are in alignment. In order to prevent unnecessary maintenance on satellite communications systems aboard aircraft AirSatOne provides a live feed for geophysical events from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center. AirSatOne's live feed allows users to view observed and predicted space storms. Geophysical Alerts are important to flight crews and maintenance personnel to determine if any upcoming activity or history has or will have an effect on satellite communications, GPS navigation and HF Communications.\n\nTelegraph lines in the past were affected by geomagnetic storms. Telegraphs used a single long wire for the data line, stretching for many miles, using the ground as the return wire and fed with DC power from a battery; this made them (together with the power lines mentioned below) susceptible to being influenced by the fluctuations caused by the ring current. The voltage/current induced by the geomagnetic storm could have diminished the signal, when subtracted from the battery polarity, or to overly strong and spurious signals when added to it; some operators learned to disconnect the battery and rely on the induced current as their power source. In extreme cases the induced current was so high the coils at the receiving side burst in flames, or the operators received electric shocks. Geomagnetic storms affect also long-haul telephone lines, including undersea cables unless they are fiber optic.\n\nDamage to communications satellites can disrupt non-terrestrial telephone, television, radio and Internet links. The National Academy of Sciences reported in 2008 on possible scenarios of widespread disruption in the 2012–2013 solar peak.\n\nSystems such as GPS, LORAN and the now-defunct OMEGA are adversely affected when solar activity disrupts their signal propagation. The OMEGA system consisted of eight transmitters located throughout the world. Airplanes and ships used the very low frequency signals from these transmitters to determine their positions. During solar events and geomagnetic storms, the system gave navigators information that was inaccurate by as much as several miles. If navigators had been alerted that a proton event or geomagnetic storm was in progress, they could have switched to a backup system.\n\nGPS signals are affected when solar activity causes sudden variations in the density of the ionosphere, causing the GPS signals to scintillate (like a twinkling star). The scintillation of satellite signals during ionospheric disturbances is studied at HAARP during ionospheric modification experiments. It has also been studied at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory.\n\nOne technology used to allow GPS receivers to continue to operate in the presence of some confusing signals is Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM). However, RAIM is predicated on the assumption that a majority of the GPS constellation is operating properly, and so it is much less useful when the entire constellation is perturbed by global influences such as geomagnetic storms. Even if RAIM detects a loss of integrity in these cases, it may not be able to provide a useful, reliable signal.\n\nGeomagnetic storms and increased solar ultraviolet emission heat Earth's upper atmosphere, causing it to expand. The heated air rises, and the density at the orbit of satellites up to about increases significantly. This results in increased drag, causing satellites to slow and change orbit slightly. Low Earth Orbit satellites that are not repeatedly boosted to higher orbits slowly fall and eventually burn up.\n\nSkylab's 1979 destruction is an example of a spacecraft reentering Earth's atmosphere prematurely as a result of higher-than-expected solar activity. During the great geomagnetic storm of March 1989, four of the Navy's navigational satellites had to be taken out of service for up to a week, the U.S. Space Command had to post new orbital elements for over 1000 objects affected and the Solar Maximum Mission satellite fell out of orbit in December the same year.\n\nThe vulnerability of the satellites depends on their position as well. The South Atlantic Anomaly is a perilous place for a satellite to pass through.\n\nAs technology has allowed spacecraft components to become smaller, their miniaturized systems have become increasingly vulnerable to the more energetic solar particles. These particles can physically damage microchips and can change software commands in satellite-borne computers.\n\nAnother problem for satellite operators is differential charging. During geomagnetic storms, the number and energy of electrons and ions increase. When a satellite travels through this energized environment, the charged particles striking the spacecraft differentially charge portions of the spacecraft. Discharges can arc across spacecraft components, harming and possibly disabling them.\n\nBulk charging (also called deep charging) occurs when energetic particles, primarily electrons, penetrate the outer covering of a satellite and deposit their charge in its internal parts. If sufficient charge accumulates in any one component, it may attempt to neutralize by discharging to other components. This discharge is potentially hazardous to the satellite's electronic systems.\n\nEarth's magnetic field is used by geologists to determine subterranean rock structures. For the most part, these geodetic surveyors are searching for oil, gas or mineral deposits. They can accomplish this only when Earth's field is quiet, so that true magnetic signatures can be detected. Other geophysicists prefer to work during geomagnetic storms, when strong variations in the Earth's normal subsurface electric currents allow them to sense subsurface oil or mineral structures. This technique is called magnetotellurics. For these reasons, many surveyors use geomagnetic alerts and predictions to schedule their mapping activities.\n\nRapidly fluctuating geomagnetic fields can produce geomagnetically induced currents in pipelines. This can cause multiple problems for pipeline engineers. Pipeline flow meters can transmit erroneous flow information and the corrosion rate of the pipeline is dramatically increased. If engineers incorrectly attempt to balance the current during a geomagnetic storm, corrosion rates may increase even more. Pipeline managers thus receive space weather alerts and warnings to allow them to implement defensive measures.\n\nIntense solar flares release very-high-energy particles that can cause radiation poisoning. \n\nEarth's atmosphere and magnetosphere allow adequate protection at ground level, but astronauts are subject to potentially lethal doses of radiation. The penetration of high-energy particles into living cells can cause chromosome damage, cancer and other health problems. Large doses can be immediately fatal.\n\nSolar protons with energies greater than 30 MeV are particularly hazardous. \n\nSolar proton events can also produce elevated radiation aboard aircraft flying at high altitudes. Although these risks are small, monitoring of solar proton events by satellite instrumentation allows the occasional exposure to be monitored and evaluated and eventually flight paths and altitudes adjusted in order to lower the absorbed dose of the flight crews.\n\nScientists are still studying whether or not animals are affected by this, some suggesting this is why whales beach themselves. Some have stated the possibility that other migrating animals including birds and honey bees, might be affected since they also use magnetoreception to navigate, and geomagnetic storms alter the Earth's magnetic fields temporarily. \n\n\nLinks related to power grids:\n"}

It was a world tour that began in Asia where her album, \"The Force Behind the Power\" had gone gold. The tour was recorded live for a television special in Japan. The tour hit the English-speaking world in Australia with the second live recorded special from Perth. She landed in America, determined to play smaller markets like Syracuse and Poughkeepsie before sweeping across America. The summer dates were across Europe beginning in a continued 6 sold out Wembley/London across the continent as the 3rd single, \"One Shining Moment\" was hitting the Top 10. The Palais de Sportes in Paris was a highlight for two nights.\nThe album continued to do well for the holidays when her huge Japanese hit \"If We Hold on Together\" became a European smash supported by the airing of \"Christmas in Vienna\" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras. Television exposure had been key throughout this tour. Earlier in the spring, Diana was invited to close the entire \"Royal Command Performance for the Queen\". It was there her first single from the album was destined for #1! The Royal Command Performance once again was instrumental in making the song a hit. \nShe returned to America to do second round dates in major markets like New York. The tour had successfully conquered North America (Canada dates were after the first run of New York dates), Asia, the English-speaking world and Europe for over 100 dates.\n\n"}

On an international level, approximately 80 percent of small-scale mining operations can be categorized as illegal. Despite strategic developments towards \"responsible mining,\" even big companies can be involved in (partially) illegal mineral digging and extraction, if only on the financing side.\n\nSpurred by widespread poverty and a lack of alternative income-earning opportunities, illegal artisanal mining is a well-documented phenomenon in sub-Saharan Africa. While legalization opportunities for artisanal and small scale mining are often available, inefficient government bureaucracy structures can make noncompliance more appealing for workers. In addition, in an effort to attract foreign investment, many governments in sub-Saharan Africa have loosened national mining investment codes. An expansion of the large-scale mining projects fueled by foreign investment has displaced rural mining communities, many of which revert to illegal mining on concessions given to the formal mining sector.\n\nIllegal gold mining in Latin America is a particular concern because of the scale of organized crime and significant rate of environmental degradation (through mercury and other toxic chemicals routinely used in gold mining) that accompany it. \n\nIllegal mining operations are often located in remote areas, making it more difficult to enforce mining standards. Furthermore, mining requirements can vary substantially from region to region, further complicating adherence with labor laws, environmental regulations, and tax legislation. Emissions of mercury originating in artisanal mining, most of which is unregulated and illegal, are substantial, contributing to 37 percent of the atmospheric mercury emitted annually.\n\nWhile drug trafficking has historically been a prominent criminal enterprise, lower risks associated with illegal mining have propelled a shift toward lucrative illegal gold mining operations. In order to transfer illegal gold into the marketplace, criminal actors sometimes attempt to mask its illicit origins by melting together processed legal and illegal gold. This gold laundering task is generally facilitated by middlemen who falsify documentation to ease the transition into the legitimate international marketplace.\n\n"}
{"id": "1301454", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1301454", "title": "John Bingham", "text": "John Bingham\n\nJohn Armor Bingham (January 21, 1815 – March 19, 1900) was an American Republican Representative from Ohio, an assistant to Judge Advocate General in the trial of the Abraham Lincoln assassination, and a prosecutor in the impeachment trials of Andrew Johnson. He is also the principal framer of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nBorn in Mercer County, Pennsylvania, where his carpenter and bricklayer father, Hugh, had moved after service in the War of 1812, Bingham attended local public schools. After his mother's death in 1827, his father remarried. John moved west to Ohio to live with his merchant uncle, Thomas, after clashing with his new stepmother. The teenager apprenticed as a printer for two years, helping to publish the \"Luminary\", an anti-Masonic newspaper. He then returned to Pennsylvania to study at Mercer College, after which Bingham studied law at Franklin College in New Athens, Harrison County, Ohio. There, Bingham befriended former slave Titus Basfield, who became the first African American to graduate college in Ohio. They continued to correspond for many years.\n\nBoth Hugh and Thomas Bingham were long time abolitionists as well as active in local politics. They initially allied with the Anti-Masonic Party, led by Pennsylvania Governor Joseph Ritner and Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly Thaddeus Stevens. Hugh became clerk of the Mercer County court and later a perennial Whig candidate in the county, known for opposing war with Mexico. Rev. John Walker, of the Associated Reform Congregational Church, ran Franklin College and was a prominent abolitionist in Ohio as well as mentor to Titus Basfield, who, after further studies, became a Presbyterian minister. Another of Bingham's longtime and childhood friends was Matthew Simpson, who later became a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church, urged President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, and ultimately delivered funeral orations for the assassinated President at the White House and his interment at Springfield, Illinois.\n\nBingham married his uncle Thomas' daughter, Amanda Bailey Bingham, in 1844. During 41 years of marriage, they raised three daughters, two of whom survived their parents, but one died in Japan.\n\nAfter graduation, Bingham returned to Mercer, Pennsylvania to read law with John James Pearson and William Stewart, and he was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar on March 25, 1840 and the Ohio bar by year's end. Bingham then returned to Cadiz, Ohio, to begin his legal and political career. An active Whig, Bingham campaigned for President William Henry Harrison. His uncle, Thomas, a prominent Presbyterian in the area, had served as associate judge in the Harrison County Court of Common Pleas from 1825 to 1839. The young lawyer's practice extended to Tuscarawas County, Ohio, and its seat, New Philadelphia. In 1846, Bingham won his first election, as district attorney for Tuscarawas County, serving from 1846 to 1849.\n\nBingham's political activity continued despite the Whig Party's decline. Campaigning as candidate of the Opposition Party, he was elected to the Thirty-fourth Congress, representing the 21st Congressional District. In Washington, DC, he roomed at the same boarding house as fellow Ohio Representative Joshua Giddings, a prominent abolitionist Bingham admired. Voters re-elected Bingham to the Thirty-fifth, Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses as a Republican. However, the district was one of two Ohio districts eliminated in the redistricting following the census of 1860. Bingham thus ran for re-elected from what became the 16th District. Known for his abolitionist views, he lost to Democratic peace candidate Joseph W. White, and thus failed to return for the Thirty-eighth Congress, in part because Union soldiers (mostly-Republican leaning), who were away from home fighting in the war, were not allowed to vote by mail in Ohio at the time. Nonetheless, the House of Representatives appointed him as one of the managers of impeachment proceedings against West H. Humphreys.\n\nDuring the Civil War, Bingham strongly supported the Union and became known as a Radical Republican. President Abraham Lincoln appointed him Judge Advocate of the Union Army with the rank of major during his hiatus from Congress, and Bingham briefly became solicitor of the United States Court of Claims in 1865.\n\nBingham defeated White in the next congressional election (Ohio had changed its law and now allowed soldiers away from home to vote by mail) and thus returned to serve in the Thirty-ninth Congress, which first met on March 4, 1865.\n\nThe following month, the capital fell into chaos as John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln, and Booth's co-conspirator Lewis Powell severely injured Secretary of State William H. Seward on the night of April 14, 1865. Booth died on April 26, 1865 from a gunshot wound. When the trials for the conspirators involved in the Lincoln assassination were ready to start, Bingham's old friend from Cadiz, Edwin Stanton, appointed him to serve as Assistant Judge Advocate General along with General Henry Burnett, another Assistant Judge Advocate General, and Joseph Holt, the Judge Advocate General.\n\nThe accused conspirators were George Atzerodt, David Herold, Lewis Powell (Paine), Samuel Arnold, Michael O'Laughlen, Edman Spangler, Samuel Mudd, and Mary Surratt. The trial began on May 10, 1865. The three prosecutors spent nearly two months in court, awaiting the jury's verdict. Bingham and Holt attempted to obscure the fact that there were two plots. The first plot was to kidnap the president and hold him hostage in exchange for the Confederate prisoners held by the Union. The second was to assassinate the president, Vice President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward and thereby throw the government into electoral chaos. The prosecution did not reveal the existence of a diary taken from Booth's body, which made clear that the assassination plan dated from 14 April. The defense surprisingly did not call for Booth's diary to be produced in court.\n\nOn June 29, 1865, the eight were found guilty for their involvement in the conspiracy to kill the President. Spangler was sentenced to six years in prison; Arnold, O'Laughlen and Mudd were sentenced to life in prison, and Atzerodt, Herold, Paine and Surratt were sentenced to hang. They were executed July 7, 1865. Surratt was the first woman in American history to be executed. O'Laughlen died in prison in 1867. Arnold, Spangler and Mudd were pardoned by President Andrew Johnson in early 1869.\n\nIn 1866, during the Thirty-ninth Congress, Bingham was appointed to a subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Reconstruction tasked with considering suffrage proposals. As a member of the subcommittee, Bingham submitted several versions of an amendment to the Constitution to apply the Bill of Rights to the States. His final submission, which was accepted by the Committee on April 28, 1866, read, \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" The Committee recommended for the language to become Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. It was introduced in the spring of 1866, passing both houses by June 1866.\n\nIn the closing debate in the House, Bingham stated:\n\nExcept for the addition of the first sentence of Section 1, which defined citizenship, the amendment weathered the Senate debate without substantial change. The 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868.\n\nDespite Bingham's likely intention for the 14th Amendment to apply the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights to the States, the US Supreme Court declined to interpret it that way in the Slaughter-House Cases and in \"United States v. Cruikshank\". In the 1947 case of \"Adamson v. California\", Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black argued in his dissent that the framers' intent should control the Court's interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, and he attached a lengthy appendix that quoted extensively from Bingham's congressional testimony. Though the Adamson Court declined to adopt Black's interpretation, the Court for the next 25 years, used a doctrine of selective incorporation that eventually extended the protections in the Bill of Rights as well as other, unenumerated rights.\n\nOhio ratified the Fourteenth Amendment on January 4, 1867, but Bingham continued to explain its extension of citizenship during the fall election season. The Fourteenth Amendment has vastly expanded civil rights protections and has come to be cited in more litigation than any other amendment to the Constitution.\n\nPresident Ulysses Grant then appointed his ally Bingham as United States Minister to Japan, which involved a salary increase but also economic responsibilities with respect to the small embassy. Initially, Bingham tried to switch ambassadorships with John Watson Foster of Indiana, whom Grant had appointed ambassador to Mexico, but Foster declined. Bingham thus sailed with his wife and two of his three daughters to Japan. Bingham ultimately served longer than any other US Ambassador to that nation, for more than twelve years and under four Republican presidents, from May 31, 1873 to July 2, 1885, when his successor, appointed by newly-elected Democratic President Grover Cleveland, arrived. (The next-longest serving American ambassador to Japan would prove to be former Democratic Senate Majority Leader Michael Joseph Mansfield, who served for ten years a century later).\n\nBingham initially moved the embassy from an unsuitable location and replaced a problematic interpreter with a Presbyterian missionary from Ohio and then mastered the art of consulting with his superiors in the State Department and trimmed the imperialistic ambitions of fellow Union veteran Charles Le Gendre. Bingham came to greatly respect Japanese culture, but he also presciently expressed his fear that Japan's military culture would hurt the country's development.\n\nBingham most distinguished himself from other Western diplomats by fighting against the unequal treaties imposed upon Japan by Britain, particularly provisions for extraterritoriality and tariff control by Westerners. Initially, Bingham supported Japan's right to restrict hunting by foreigners to certain times and places and later its right to regulate incoming ships via quarantines to restrict the spread of cholera. Bingham later negotiated return of the Shimonoseki indemnity in 1877 as well as a revision of Japan's treaty with the United States in 1879, which restored some tariff autonomy to Japan, conditioned upon other treaties with Westerners.\n\nBingham continued his career as a representative and was re-elected to the Fortieth, Forty-first, and Forty-second Congresses. He served as Chairman of the Committee on Claims from 1867 to 1869 and a member of the Committee on the Judiciary from 1869 to 1873.\n\nIn 1868, Bingham was one of the House managers in the impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. Bingham was also implicated in the Credit Mobilier scandal and in 1872, he lost the election. Three local Republican political bosses made a deal to cut out Bingham, instead selecting Lorenzo Danford as the party's candidate. Thus, Danford came to represent the 16th district in the Forty-third Congress and was re-elected several times but with a hiatus.\n\nBingham died in Cadiz, Ohio on March 19, 1900, nine years after his wife Amanda. He was interred next to her in the Old Cadiz (Union) Cemetery in Cadiz.\n\nIn 1901, Harrison County erected a bronze statue honoring Bingham in Cadiz.\n\nMercer County has John Bingham's house dedicated to him and now serves as the county's Republican Headquarters.\n\n\n.

{"id": "462495", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462495", "title": "Kelvin MacKenzie", "text": "Kelvin MacKenzie\n\nKelvin Calder MacKenzie (born 22 October 1946) is an English media executive and a former newspaper editor. Best known for being editor of \"The Sun\" from 1981, the publication was by then established as the Britain's largest circulation newspaper. After leaving \"The Sun\" in 1994, he was appointed to executive roles in satellite television and other broadcasting outlets, as well as being involved in a number of publishing enterprises.\n\nAfter short periods as a columnist at the \"Daily Mail\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", MacKenzie returned to his old paper in the same role. His contract was terminated in May 2017 after being suspended.\n\nMacKenzie was born in Thanet, Kent, to Ian and Mary MacKenzie, both journalists working for \"The South London Observer\". When the South London Press took over their paper, Mary became press chief for the Conservative leader of the Greater London Council, Horace Cutler. Kelvin's father died in April 2004 at the age of 84. Educated at Alleyn's School in Dulwich, MacKenzie left school with one O-level in English literature. He joined the \"South East London Mercury\" at 17, and worked on local and then national newspapers, such as the \"Daily Express\" for the next ten years.\n\nMacKenzie has said that he discovered early on in his career that he had little writing ability and that his talents lay in making up headlines and laying out pages. By 1978, at the age of 32, he was managing editor of the \"New York Post\", two years after it had been purchased by Rupert Murdoch.\n\nAfter moving back to the United Kingdom and a period as night editor of the \"Daily Express\", Murdoch appointed him \"The Sun\" editor in 1981. Conflict between the two groups meant that MacKenzie performed both jobs for a time.\n\nIn 1978, \"The Sun\" had finally overtaken the \"Daily Mirror\" in circulation becoming the newspaper with the highest sales in the UK. It was MacKenzie though who cemented the paper's image as a right-wing tabloid, not only increasing its profile, but also making it known for its attacks on left-wing political figures and movements and its sensationalist front-page celebrity exposés. These often proved to be misleading or false, with many controversies in this area occurring during MacKenzie editorship. Commentators including \"The Guardian\" contributor Roy Greenslade and journalist John Pilger have commented on the alleged 'Murdoch effect'. MacKenzie himself stated that he feels that his own spell as editor of \"The Sun\" had a \"positively downhill impact on journalism\".\n\nMacKenzie is quoted as saying in the early 1980s (on the subject of how he perceived \"The Sun\"s target audience):\nThe paper was frequently accused of dumbing down public discourse because of its preoccupations; Pilger blamed it for the promotion of jingoism, racism, homophobia, and intolerance.\n\nMacKenzie was widely criticised for his perceived cruelty to both the targets of his – sometimes false – newspaper allegations; his choice of targets frequently being not only left-wing politicians and celebrities but even ordinary members of the public, and also his alleged cruelty to his own staff and colleagues, to which MacKenzie has since responded:\n\nMacKenzie was responsible for the \"Gotcha\" front-page headline of 4 May 1982, which reported the contentious sinking of the Argentinian cruiser \"General Belgrano\" by a British submarine during the Falklands War. MacKenzie was heavily condemned by some commentators who felt he was glorifying death and the headline caused a storm of controversy and protest, although MacKenzie had actually changed the front-page of later editions to \"Did 1,200 Argies drown?\" after it was established that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties. MacKenzie later defended his \"Gotcha\" headline, saying:\nDespite MacKenzie's self-professed pride at having printed the \"Gotcha\" headline, Roy Greenslade has said that he had only chosen the headline prior to it becoming clear that there had been a large number of Argentine casualties resulting from the sinking of the \"Belgrano\" and that even he later became concerned that the headline may be seen as insensitive and distasteful.\n\nGreenslade states that MacKenzie insisted on changing the headline to \"Did 1,200 Argies Die?\" for later editions because of these concerns, and that he did so against the wishes of Rupert Murdoch, present in the newspaper building at the time because of an industrial dispute, who reputedly demanded that the \"Gotcha\" headline remain, despite the large number of casualties and later said of the headline, \"I rather liked it\". This is reportedly the only occasion that MacKenzie ever disobeyed a specific order from Murdoch.\n\nMacKenzie's coverage of the Falklands War was criticised by many commentators for being a glorification of war (Greenslade was working with MacKenzie on \"The Sun\" at the time).\nMacKenzie was responsible for the \"Freddie Starr Ate My Hamster\" front-page headline. The claims made in the accompanying article, that the comedian Freddie Starr had placed his girlfriend's hamster on a sandwich and proceeded to eat it, turned out to be entirely untrue and an invention of the publicist Max Clifford. The headline is often held up as the prime example of \"The Sun\"'s supposedly celebrity-obsessed, sensationalist and often inaccurate journalism.\n\nIn the general elections which were held during his time as editor, MacKenzie's \"Sun\" strongly supported the Conservative Party and its policies.\n\nAlthough the coverage of the 1992 election remains the best remembered, there were many other vitriolic personal attacks on Labour leaders by MacKenzie's \"Sun\" during elections, such as in 1983 campaign, when MacKenzie ran a front page featuring an unflattering photograph of Michael Foot, then nearly 70 years old, alongside the headline \"Do You Really Want This Old Fool To Run Britain?\".\n\nMacKenzie's coverage of the British miners' strike in 1984–1985 supported the police and the Thatcher government against the striking NUM miners. The paper was accused of making misleading or even outright false claims about the miners, their unions and leader Arthur Scargill. MacKenzie at one point prepared a front page with the headline \"Mine Führer\" and a photograph of Scargill with his arm in the air, a pose giving the appearance of him making a Nazi salute. The print workers at \"The Sun\", regarding it as an attempt at a cheap smear, refused to print it.\n\nAt the time of the 1987 general election MacKenzie ran a mock-editorial entitled \"Why I'm Backing Kinnock, by Joseph Stalin\".\n\nOn the day of the 1992 election MacKenzie used the front-page headline \"If Kinnock Wins Today, Will The Last Person To Leave Britain Please Turn Out The Lights\", accompanied by a picture of Kinnock's head superimposed over a lightbulb. While the paper initially supported the government of John Major, because it appeared that Major himself shared the ideological hostility of Thatcher towards European integration, this soon changed. Following the UK's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on Black Wednesday in September 1992, according to MacKenzie, Major telephoned him to ask about how the paper would report the story. While Major has denied the conversation ever took place, MacKenzie has claimed his response was: \"Prime Minister, I have on my desk in front of me a very large bucket of shit which I am just about to pour all over you.\"\n\nIn January 1987, MacKenzie published a totally unfounded front-page story alleging that pop singer Elton John had had sex with underage rentboys. Shortly afterwards, MacKenzie published further entirely false allegations that the singer had had the voiceboxes of his guard dogs removed because their barking kept him awake at night. MacKenzie confirmed their inaccuracy shortly after publication by sending a reporter to the singer's house, who quickly discovered that all of his guard dogs were quite capable of barking.\n\nMacKenzie later admitted that in retrospect he found it difficult to understand why he had believed, never mind published, the claims about the guard dogs which he later realised were self-evidently absurd. Elton John sued \"The Sun\" for libel over both these claims and was later awarded £1,000,000 in damages. MacKenzie later said of Elton John:\nThere were many other controversies during MacKenzie's time in charge of \"The Sun\". MacKenzie at one point ran a story about a previously unknown member of the public who had just undergone a heart transplant operation, the story denouncing the man as a \"love rat\", \"Sun\" journalists having been told that he had left his wife 15 years earlier. Aside from criticism about the story's highly questionable news value, the newspaper was furiously condemned as the story was run when the man's recovery was still in the balance.\n\nMacKenzie and his team were accused of simply inventing many of the stories that appeared in the newspaper, as well as interviews, and in some instances this proved to be the case, such as when an entirely fabricated interview with the disfigured Falklands war hero Simon Weston was published, which was criticised for \"inviting readers to feel revulsion at his disfigurement\". MacKenzie himself once told his staff: \"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\"\n\nSome other controversies that occurred under MacKenzie include a headline describing Australian Aborigines as \"The Abo's: Brutal and Treacherous\" (which was condemned as \"inaccurate\" and \"unacceptably racist\" by the Press Council) and MacKenzie's sending of photographers to break into a psychiatric hospital to ask actor Jeremy Brett, who was a patient in the hospital at the time and who was suffering from manic depression and dying of cardiomyopathy, whether he was \"dying of AIDS\". The newspaper apparently suspected Brett of being a homosexual and that his mystery illness might be AIDS, which it was not.\n\nThese incidents caused \"The Sun\" to be criticised, but the newspaper's profile increased dramatically during MacKenzie's time as editor although sales figures dipped. On the subject of the sensationalist and sometimes inaccurate reporting which appeared in \"The Sun\" during his time as editor, MacKenzie has said:\n\nIn April 1989, the single biggest controversy during MacKenzie's period as editor occurred, later described in a \"Sun\" editorial in 2004 as \"the most terrible mistake in our history\", during the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, a deadly crush which occurred during an FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield claiming the lives of 96 Liverpool fans.\n\n\"The Sun\" printed the front-page headline \"The Truth\", with three sub-headings, \"Some Fans Picked Pockets of Victims\", \"Some Fans Urinated on the Brave Cops\" and \"Some Fans Beat Up PC Giving Kiss of Life\". The accompanying article claimed that ticketless and drunken Liverpool fans were responsible for the disaster, having supposedly tried to fight their way into the stadium by rushing the turnstiles and attacking policemen outside the ground. Further specific allegations were made that during the disaster itself Liverpool fans inside the stadium had stolen wallets and other items from the dead, had urinated over policemen and the bodies of dead fans, that they had beaten policemen, ambulance men and rescue workers attempting to save the lives of other fans and had sexually abused the body of a dead girl after shouting \"throw her up and we'll fuck her\" to policemen moving her body.\n\nThe sources for these allegations were stated to be anonymous high-ranking police officers from Sheffield police and Irvine Patnick, then Conservative MP for Sheffield Hallam, who was not even present at the match. In 2007, on BBC television's \"Question Time\", MacKenzie additionally claimed that one of his sources was a regional news agency. The article was accompanied by graphic photographs showing Liverpool fans, including young children, choking and suffocating as they were being crushed against the perimeter fences surrounding the terraces – this was widely condemned as inappropriate.\n\nThe coverage and the allegations caused intense uproar throughout Merseyside, where \"The Sun\" was boycotted, with public burnings of the paper organised and many newsagents (including in Everton F.C.-supporting areas) refusing to stock it at all. There was widespread criticism and condemnation from many commentators. The Press Council described the allegations unequivocally as \"lies\". The official government enquiry into the disaster dismissed the allegation that drunken Liverpool fans had been responsible for the disaster and concluded that inadequate crowd control and errors by the police had been the primary cause of the tragedy.\n\nPrior to the publication of \"The Sun\"s initial article, a number of local newspapers in Yorkshire, such as the \"Sheffield Star\" and \"The Yorkshire Post\", published very similar allegations. It has since emerged that many British national newspaper editors were offered the same story from the same sources the day before \"The Sun\" article was published but while many national newspapers printed allegations about Liverpool fans being responsible for the disaster, only MacKenzie and his counterpart at the \"Daily Star\" newspaper were prepared to print the more outlandish allegations about theft and abuse of dead bodies, with many editors feeling that the claims sounded dubious. Furthermore, the other national papers which printed coverage claiming Liverpool fans to be responsible for the disaster, including the \"Daily Star\", withdrew their allegations and apologised the day after publication, whereas \"The Sun\" did not.\n\nIn their book about the history of \"The Sun\", Peter Chippindale and Chris Horrie wrote:\nMurdoch for his part ordered MacKenzie to appear on BBC Radio 4's \"The World This Weekend\" in the aftermath of the controversy to apologise. MacKenzie said on the programme: \"It was my decision and my decision alone to do that front page in that way and I made a rather serious error\".\n\nIn 1993 he told a House of Commons National Heritage Select Committee that\n\nIn 1996, MacKenzie again discussed the matter on Radio 4 but this time claimed: \"The Sun did not accuse anybody of anything. We were the vehicle for others\".\n\nSales of \"The Sun\" on Merseyside have not recovered, with News International (now News UK) losing several million pounds a year in revenue. Many newsagents on Merseyside continue to refuse to stock the newspaper.\n\nIn January 1994, MacKenzie moved to BSkyB, another of Murdoch's News Corporation assets, but left within a few months.\n\nIn 1995, MacKenzie joined Mirror Group Newspapers and was appointed joint boss of its fledgling L!VE TV British cable television channel. The station had previously been headed by Janet Street-Porter, who had set out to establish L!VE TV as an alternative, youth-orientated station. She clashed with MacKenzie over programme content and soon left, leaving him in sole charge.\n\nMacKenzie later said that he would agree to indulge in a \"night of passion\" with Janet Street-Porter and that he would be \"willing\" but only if she paid him £4.7m, a figure he had arrived at after calculating how much money he would lose from \"loss of reputation, the negative impact on future earnings etc\".\n\nMacKenzie took a radically different approach and was criticised for producing severely down-market programming. MacKenzie introduced features such as nightly editions of 'Topless Darts' (featuring topless women playing darts on a beach), 'The Weather in Norwegian' (with a young, typically blonde and bikini-clad Scandinavian woman presenting weather forecasts in both English and Norwegian), other weather forecasts featuring dwarfs bouncing on trampolines and stock exchange reports presented by Tiffany, a young female presenter who would strip to her underwear as she read out the latest share prices. A large amount of airtime was given over to tarot card readers and astrologers. L!VE TV's best known character was the News Bunny, a man dressed as a giant rabbit who popped up during news broadcasts to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to the various news stories to indicate whether or not he found them interesting or exciting.\n\nThe station had a budget of only £2,000 an hour and attracted a very small audience, with an average of 200,000 viewers, but it was well-known because of the controversy and criticism surrounding its programming, which led to the station being labelled \"Tabloid TV\" and even \"Sun TV\" (in reference to the newspaper, some critics accusing MacKenzie of doing nothing more than creating a television version of his old newspaper). MacKenzie has been accused of taking a \"shamelessly tacky approach\". He eventually left the station in 1997. He later said on LIVE TV:\n\nIn November 1998, MacKenzie headed a consortium, TalkCo Holdings, which purchased Talk Radio from CLT for £24.7 million. One of the financial backers was News International, News Corporation's UK subsidiary. In 1999 TalkCo was renamed The Wireless Group and in January 2000 Talk Radio was rebranded as TalkSport. The Wireless Group acquired The Radio Partnership in 1999, gaining control of its nine local commercial stations. In May 2005, it was announced that the Northern Irish media company, UTV plc, had made an agreed offer to buy the company, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. In June 2005, the takeover proceeded, with MacKenzie being replaced by UTV executive Scott Taunton. The station lost listeners during MacKenzie's tenure.\n\nIn September 2005, MacKenzie took over Highbury House Communications, a magazine publishing company based in Bournemouth and Orpington. HHC held a number of titles mainly in the leisure and computer games market with a 'ladette' title sitting uncomfortably in its portfolio. HHC was already suffering from massive debts when MacKenzie took the reins and despite efforts on his part to broker a life-line to save the ailing company, he had inherited a poisoned legacy. This venture also failed; Highbury closed in December 2005.\n\nMacKenzie then spent a year as chairman of one of the UK's largest marketing and communications groups, Media Square plc. This was unsuccessful and MacKenzie left in March 2007.\n\nDespite the aforementioned criticism of the corporation, in March 2006, MacKenzie joined BBC Radio Five Live as a presenter. He made his debut on the station over the summer, presenting a series of programmes telling the story of various scandals which have occurred at FIFA World Cup tournaments over the years. He then presented a retrospective look at the year gone by on Christmas Day.\n\nIn May 2006, MacKenzie returned to \"The Sun\", this time as a columnist, where he was accused using one of his columns to launch an attack on the people of Scotland (see below). On the subject of the columns themselves, he has said \"I want to get the Lonsdale Belt for vile and be personally rude to as many people as possible.\" In June 2011, it was announced that MacKenzie would leave \"The Sun\" to write a column for the \"Daily Mail\". It emerged in December 2016, during a civil case, that he had left \"The Sun\" because Rebekah Brooks, then head of News International, and Dominic Mohan, then editor of \"The Sun\", had not told him of the extent of the company's phone hacking scandal. MacKenzie was also concerned about their employment of Jeremy Clarkson whose privacy injunction against his ex-wife was then in force. However he left the \"Mail\" in July 2012 after writing for the title for one year, citing an \"increased commercial workload\". Subsequently, \"The Guardian\" reported that MacKenzie's departure was due to disagreements regarding the editing of his column.\n\nMacKenzie was an early investor in online video company Base79, established by his son Ashley MacKenzie in 2007. They sold the firm in 2014.\n\nIn 2011 MacKenzie launched the online TV channel Sports Tonight, describing the channel as \"Sky Sports News meets TalkSport\". The channel received investment from former Conservative Party treasurer Lord Ashcroft, who took a minority stake.\n\nMacKenzie joined \"The Daily Telegraph\" as an online columnist in 2013, however he was dropped by the newspaper after one column, with Roy Greenslade reporting in \"The Guardian\" that he was let go because of upset among staff on the \"Telegraph\" sports desk at his role in reporting on the Hillsborough disaster, in particular from football columnist and ex-Liverpool player Alan Hansen, who played at Hillsborough.\nIn April 2013, \"The Guardian\" reported that the \"Daily Mail\" was being sued for libel for £200,000 over a column by MacKenzie. The claim was brought by an NHS doctor, Antonio Serrano, whom MacKenzie had criticised in the paper.\n\nIn October 2014, MacKenzie was a contestant on gameshow \"Pointless Celebrities\". Angered viewers complained to host Richard Osman, who said that if he had known in advance, he would not have let him appear.\n\nIn December 2014 \"The Sun\" announced that MacKenzie would make a second return to the newspaper as a columnist.\n\nMacKenzie's commitment to Conservative, Thatcherite politics has led him to argue that Margaret Thatcher is the UK's greatest post-war prime minister. In 2003, he presented a documentary, \"Kelvin Saves the Tories\", in which he proposed a low-tax, anti-BBC and cautiously pro-capital punishment manifesto for the party. However, in February 2008, in a \"Sun\" newspaper article, MacKenzie claimed that he is now against the return of the death penalty.\n\nIn May 2008, MacKenzie stood for election as a local councillor in Elmbridge. He lost the election, gaining 227 votes whereas the Conservative seat holder Glenn Dearlove won 679.\n\nThat same year, after Conservative member of parliament David Davis announced that he would resign his seat in the House of Commons in order to fight a by-election as a protest against the Labour government's plans for 42-day detention without charge for terrorist suspects, MacKenzie announced that he was likely to contest the election on a pro-42-day detention platform, stating: \"I have been associated with \"The Sun\" for 30 years. \"The Sun\" is very, very hostile to David Davis because of his 28 day stance and \"The Sun\" has always been very up for 42 days and perhaps even 420 days\". Off-camera, before a BBC interview, MacKenzie referred to Hull, which the Haltemprice and Howden constituency borders, as \"an absolute shocker\". Asked to clarify those comments, he said it was \"a joke\" and that he has \"never actually been to Hull\".\n\nMacKenzie subsequently decided not to run for the Haltemprice and Howden seat, stating: \"The clincher for me was the money. Clearly \"The Sun\" couldn't put up the cash – so I was going to have to rustle up a maximum of £100,000 to conduct my campaign.\"\n\nDuring an after-dinner speech to Newcastle-based law firm Mincoffs Solicitors on 30 November 2006, MacKenzie is reported to have said of his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster:\n\nMacKenzie went on to compare Merseysiders with animal rights activists. \"If this got out, it would blow up all over again\", MacKenzie is said to have remarked.\n\nThe remarks were met with widespread incredulity and condemnation, particularly on Merseyside, where Liverpool F.C., the local \"Liverpool Echo\" and numerous local MPs condemned MacKenzie, with Walton MP Peter Kilfoyle arguing that the quotes confirmed that MacKenzie was \"never fit to edit a national newspaper\". The \"Liverpool Echo\" called for \"The Sun\" to sack MacKenzie as a columnist. \"The Sun\" issued a statement saying that they had \"already apologised for what happened and we stand by that apology.\" However, despite reports of consternation at \"The Sun\" over MacKenzie's statements, the newspaper chose to retain him as a columnist. MacKenzie refused to comment publicly on the controversy and pulled out of a scheduled appearance on BBC television's \"Question Time\" later that week.\n\nEarlier that autumn MacKenzie had already provoked controversy in Liverpool by stating in a \"Press Gazette\" interview that he had never knowingly printed any lies in \"The Sun\" and that even stories which later turned out to be untrue were still \"good stories\". In relation to the publishing of false or misleading reports in \"The Sun\", MacKenzie asked \"What am I supposed to feel ashamed about?\" MacKenzie was not specifically referring to the coverage of the Hillsborough disaster and made no mention of the tragedy during the interview, but the \"Liverpool Echo\" published a piece reporting MacKenzie's statements and criticising the apparent lack of shame or regret over the Hillsborough coverage implied by them (and the fact that MacKenzie may still regard the misleading coverage as a \"good story\").\n\nAlthough there was actually little reaction to the quotes on Merseyside at the time, they did draw comment from Phil Hammond, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, who said: \"I can't believe that even after all these years, there is no remorse or regret for the hurt he caused\". It was still thought at this point however that, although MacKenzie appeared not to regret the coverage, he no longer regarded it as having any factual basis after his apparent admissions in the past that the allegations made were lies fed to him by police officers and a Conservative MP.\n\nOn 6 January 2007, a protest took place at Anfield Stadium, the home of Liverpool F.C., during the FA Cup Third Round match against Arsenal F.C.. The protest was organised by fan group Reclaim The Kop, with the support of Liverpool F.C., and was directed towards MacKenzie personally and his continuing allegations about Hillsborough, and also towards the BBC (which was present at the stadium, broadcasting the game live on television) for employing MacKenzie as a radio presenter and paying him with television licence payers' (and therefore public) money. Almost 12,000 people in the Kop stand held up a mosaic which spelled out the words 'The Truth' whilst Liverpool supporters chanted \"Justice for the 96\" for six minutes, signifying the length of time that the Hillsborough game played on for before being abandoned. MacKenzie did not publicly respond to the protest.\n\nOn 11 January 2007, MacKenzie appeared on BBC television's \"Question Time\" programme, broadcast from a venue in Kent. Towards the end of the programme, MacKenzie was asked by presenter David Dimbleby about \"The Sun\"s claims about the Hillsborough disaster. MacKenzie said that he stood by his allegation that ticketless fans were the cause of the disaster but that he does not know whether the other allegations about theft from the dead and fans urinating over victims and policemen were true. Clare Short MP suggested MacKenzie should apologise to the bereaved families and survivors who say that his claims cause them distress and hurt but he refused, claiming that it would make no difference anyway due to the bad blood between himself and Liverpool F.C. MacKenzie suggested that those who feel angry at him should instead direct their anger towards \"someone who caused the disaster\". MacKenzie was heckled by some members of the audience while Short was applauded when she repeated her suggestion that he should retract his claims and apologise, but MacKenzie remained adamant that he had nothing to apologise for.\n\nIn February 2007, \"Independent\" journalist Matthew Norman claimed that MacKenzie was considering issuing a public apology for his coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, although at the time he was \"still unsure\" as to whether to do so. His former colleague at \"The Sun\", Roy Greenslade has suggested that the real reason why MacKenzie may be so hesitant to apologise and admit the inaccuracy of the coverage may be his \"anti-Scouse\" bias, which Greenslade suspects makes it difficult for MacKenzie to \"bring himself to say sorry to the city's people\".\n\nOn 12 September 2012, following the publication of the official report into the disaster using previously withheld government papers which has exonerated the Liverpool fans present at the match, MacKenzie issued the following statement:\n\nTrevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, rejected Mr MacKenzie's apology as \"too little, too late\", calling him \"lowlife, clever lowlife, but lowlife\".\nThe copy from White's news agency was available to other newspapers, who reported the story as allegations – \"The Sun\" reported the allegations, on McKenzie's say-so, as 'the truth'.\n\nFollowing the Warrington Inquests verdicts, Mackenzie was door-stepped by Alex Thomson of \"Channel 4 News\". He was filmed pleading \"Please Alex, this isn't reasonable\". Nine complaints were received by Ofcom asserting MacKenzie's privacy had been invaded, but in its adjudication, the regulator rejected the application.\n\nDespite apologising on a number of platforms, in 2016, MacKenzie made a joke in \"The Sun\" newspaper that if it was true that George Osborne (the then Chancellor of the Exchequer) was putting gongs up for sale, he should be made Lord MacKenzie of Anfield (Liverpool FC's home stadium).\n\nA day before the 28th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster in April 2017, MacKenzie's column in \"The Sun\" mentioned the Everton footballer Ross Barkley appearing to imply Barkley deserved to be beaten up in a nightclub incident earlier in the week. Comparing the player to a \"gorilla at the zoo\", MacKenzie was accused of racism (Barkley is of part-Nigerian descent). The column was removed from the newspaper's website on the afternoon of its day of publication. Later in the day, a spokesman for the newspaper apologised \"for the offence caused\" and said the columnist \"has been suspended from the paper with immediate effect. The views expressed by Kelvin Mackenzie about the people of Liverpool were wrong, unfunny and are not the view of the paper\". A month after the column appeared, it was announced that MacKenzie's \"contract with News Group Newspapers\", the \"Sun\"s publishers, \"has been terminated by mutual consent\".\n\nIn response to MacKenzie's article, on the day of its publication Everton FC banned \"The Sun\" and its reporters \"from all areas of its operation\" following Liverpool FC who had made such a decision about \"The Sun\" in February 2017.\n\nMacKenzie made a series of attacks on the people of Scotland in 2007, although he is partly of Scottish descent – his grandfather was from Stirling. In addition, his three names are all Scottish in origin. Kelvin is the name of one of the rivers that runs through Glasgow, Calder is the name of a river in the Highlands and the surname MacKenzie derives from the Scottish Gaelic \"Mac Coinnich\" meaning son of Coinneach, a Highland clan.\n\nIn July 2006, MacKenzie wrote a column for \"The Sun\" newspaper referring to Scots as \"Tartan Tosspots\" and apparently rejoicing in the fact that Scotland has a lower life expectancy than the rest of the United Kingdom. MacKenzie's column provoked a storm of protest, and was heavily condemned by numerous commentators including Scottish MPs and MSPs.\n\nOn 11 October 2007, MacKenzie appeared on the BBC's \"Question Time\" TV programme and launched another attack on Scotland. During a debate about tax, MacKenzie claimed that:\nThe comments came as part of an attack on prime minister Gordon Brown, whom MacKenzie said could not be trusted to manage the British economy because he was \"a socialist Scot\", and insisting that this was relevant to the debate. Fellow panellist Chuka Umunna from the think tank Compass called his comments \"absolutely disgraceful\", and booing and jeering were heard from the Cheltenham studio audience. The BBC received around 200 complaints and MacKenzie's comments drew widespread criticism, including comments from the Scottish entrepreneur Duncan Bannatyne who responded on BBC Radio 5 Live:\nOn 13 January 2012, MacKenzie once again appeared on the BBC's \"Question Time\" television programme and remarked on the move for Scottish independence: \n\nIn July 2016, after the 2016 Nice attack, MacKenzie wrote an article for \"The Sun\" in which he queried whether it was appropriate for \"Channel 4 News\" presenter Fatima Manji to read the news wearing a hijab. Manji accused MacKenzie of attempting to \"intimidate Muslims out of public life\" and attempting to smear 1.6 billion Muslims in suggesting they are inherently violent. She said, \"He has attempted to smear half of them further by suggesting they are helpless slaves. And he has attempted to smear me by suggesting I would sympathise with a terrorist\".\n\nThe Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) received 17 complaints about Manji wearing the hijab, an objection which was rejected. Eventually, the IPSO received 1,700 complaints about MacKenzie's article. The IPSO ruled in October 2016 that MacKenzie was \"entitled\" to make his comments, and a \"prejudicial or pejorative reference\" to Manji's religion was not present in the article. Manji said the ruling meant it was now \"open season on minorities, and Muslims in particular\".\n\nMacKenzie married Jacqueline Holland in 1968 in Camberwell. As a couple, they had a daughter (born 1969) and two sons (born 1972 and 1974). His elder son and his daughter worked at Talk Radio. In the late 1990s, MacKenzie was featured in \"The Mail on Sunday\" holidaying in what the paper described as a \"love nest\" in Barbados with News International secretary Joanna Duckworth. MacKenzie and his wife divorced on the grounds of his adultery in 2006. On 25 July 2008, he married Sarah McLean in Sunningdale, Berkshire; she works for McGraw-Hill.\n\nMacKenzie was a supporter of Charlton Athletic F.C. for 12 years but switched allegiance to Queens Park Rangers after Charlton's relegation from the Championship in 2009.\n\n"}

The series features childlike caricatures of members of the George W. Bush administration, and other American and international political leaders. Donick Cary created the series initially as content for Amp'd Mobile.\n\nThe first season's episodes each consist of two story segments, with each segment featuring a musical performance by a band composed of main characters. The second season, which premiered on March 13, 2008, consists of ten episodes, and features thirty minute storylines including the musical segment. The second season finale aired on May 15, 2008. The show was not renewed for a third season.\n\n\"Li'l Bush\" takes place in an alternate reality version of the present day, where George H. W. Bush is president and George W. Bush (\"Li'l George\" on the show), along with his cronies (members of George W. Bush's real life former staff), are children attending Beltway Elementary School. Issues in which the latter Bush Administration is involved (for example, the Iraq War) are transferred to the elder Bush, but feature the younger Bush interacting with them in various ways.\n\nAlso, just as George Bush's father is president, the parents of the other kids are members of the elder Bush's cabinet (all depicted as their real life adult counterparts, with the exception of the elder Cheney, who is depicted as Cheney with a Darth Vader helmet). The show pokes fun at George W.

A common complaint is that the show comes too late in Bush's presidency to remain topical. Other complaints accuse it of immaturity and lack of subtlety.\n\nNot all the reviews, however, have been negative. Among others, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" gave the show a positive review. A review from About.com cited the show's \"cleverness and maturity,\" likening it to \"a less bloody \"South Park\"\". Likewise, in a Netscape review, the show was credited as a political satire which \"pinpoints the logical extreme of real life.\"\n\n\n"}

Originally built on former marshland of the submerged Poltva River, the Lviv Opera now sits at the end of Freedom Avenue (), the tree-lined centerpiece of Lviv's historic Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in the city's Halych district.\n\nAccording to the inscription in the theater lobby, the building was constructed between 1897 and 1900, and has remained standing throughout several changes in history. Originally built when Lviv was the capital of the autonomous province of Galicia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Lviv Opera () first stood at the end of Archduke Karl Ludwig Avenue, was later known as the Grand Theatre () of the Second Polish Republic, and during the time of Soviet rule, entering patrons would pass by a towering statue of Vladimir Lenin. For four decades, the theater was known as the \"Ivan Franko Lviv State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet\", having been renamed in 1956 after the city's famous poet and political activist on the centenary of his birth. In 2000, the Lviv Opera celebrated its own centennial with another renaming, this time after one of the city's native daughters, Solomiya Krushelnytska, a renowned soprano of the early 20th century.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, local leaders felt the need for a large city theatre to be situated in the capital of Galicia (, ). In 1895, the city announced an architectural design competition, which attracted a large number of submissions. Among the participants were the renowned Viennese architects Fellner & Helmer, whose entry was rejected as too international and eclectic.\n\nAn independent jury chose the design by Zygmunt Gorgolewski, a graduate of the Berlin Building Academy and the director of city's Engineering Academy. Gorgolewski pleasantly surprised the jury by planning to locate the building in the center of the city, despite the area having been already densely built-up. In order to solve the space problem, he boldly proposed to enclose the Poltva River underground, and instead of using a traditional foundation, utilized a reinforced concrete base for the first time in Europe.\n\nIn June 1897, the cornerstone was placed. Gorgolewski oversaw construction, earthwork and design, employing the leading stonemasons from the city and beyond. Local materials were used wherever possible, however marble elements were manufactured in Vienna, special linen for painting in the foyer was imported from Belgium. The Austrian company Siemens was ran the electrical wiring and lights, while the hydraulic mechanization of the stage was built by the Polish railway workshop company in Sanok.\n\nConstruction continued for three years. Funding came from the city, the surrounding communities, and from voluntary donations. The cost of the works totaled 6 million Austrian crowns.\n\nStories remain that despite the engineering innovations used by Gorgolewski to construct the foundation of the building, it began to slowly sink because of the Poltva river running underneath it in a tunnel. Learning of the flaw, the architect took it to heart and fell into depression, and hung himself. This is not borne out by facts, as the engineer actually died of heart disease. After some initial settling, the building ceased 'sinking' and remains stable to this day, owing to the innovative design of Gorgolewski.\n\nThe Lviv Opera opened on October 4, 1900. The cultural elite—painters, writers, and composers, as well as delegations from various European theatres—attended the opening festivities. Among the guests attending the ceremony were writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, composer Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the painter Henryk Siemiradzki, the Chief magistrate of Lviv Godzimir Małachowski, the provincial governor Leon Piniński and head of the provincial assembly Count Stanisław Badeni. A delegation from the city of Prague was headed by mayor Vladimir Srb and former director of the National Theatre, František Adolf Šubert. Due to recent deaths of both the Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic archbishops, the building was blessed by the Armenian Catholic archbishop of Lviv, Izaak Mikołaj Isakowicz, alongside rabbi Ezechiel Caro and the Protestant pastor Garfel.\n\nThe grand opening gala that evening included excerpts from: \n\nThe Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet is built in the classical tradition with using forms and details of Renaissance and Baroque architecture, also known as the Viennese neo-Renaissance style. The stucco mouldings and oil paintings on the walls and ceilings of the multi-tiered auditorium and foyer give it a richly festive appearance. The Opera's imposing facade is opulently decorated with numerous niches, Corinthian columns, pilasters, balustrades, cornices, statues, reliefs and stucco garlands. Standing in niches on either side of the main entrance are allegorical figures representing Comedy and Tragedy sculpted by Antoni Popiel and Tadeusz Baroncz; figures of muses embellish the top of the cornice. The building is crowned by large bronze statues, symbolizing Glory, Poetry and Music.\n\nThe theatre, beautifully decorated inside and outside, became a centrefold of the achievements in sculpture and painting of Western Europe at the end of the 19th century. The internal decoration was prepared by some of the most renowned Polish artists of the time. Among them were Stanisław Wójcik (allegorical sculptures of Poetry, Music, Fame, Fortune, Comedy and Tragedy), Julian Markowski, Tadeusz Wiśniowiecki, Tadeusz Barącz, Piotr Wojtowicz (relief depicting the coat of arms of Lviv), Juliusz Bełtowski (bas-relief of Gorgolewski) and Antoni Popiel (sculptures of Muses decorating the façade).\n\nAmong the painters to decorate the interior were Tadeusz Popiel (staircases), Stanisław Rejchan (main hall), Stanisław Dębicki, Stanisław Kaczor-Batowski and Marceli Harasimowicz (foyer). The team supervised by the abovementioned artists included further painters, among them Aleksander Augustynowicz, Ludwik Kohler, Walery Kryciński, Henryk Kuhn, Edward Pietsch, Zygmunt Rozwadowski, Tadeusz Rybkowski and Julian Zuber. The main curtain was decorated by Henryk Siemiradzki.\n\n\"a.\" \"The Habsburg Empire. The World of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy in Original Photographs 1840-1916\" by Franz Hubmann, Vienna, 1971, attributes this theatre to Fellner & Helmer.\n\n"}

{"id": "5571803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5571803", "title": "Nicky Barr", "text": "Nicky Barr\n\nAndrew William \"Nicky\" Barr, (10 December 1915 – 12 June 2006) was a member of the Australian national rugby union team, who became a fighter ace in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World War II. He was credited with 12 aerial victories, all scored flying the Curtiss P-40 fighter. Born in New Zealand, Barr was raised in Victoria and first represented the state in rugby in 1936. Selected to play for Australia in the United Kingdom in 1939, he had just arrived in England when the tour was cancelled following the outbreak of war. He joined the RAAF in 1940 and was posted to North Africa with No. 3 Squadron in September 1941. The squadron's highest-scoring ace, he attained his first three victories in the P-40 Tomahawk and the remainder in the P-40 Kittyhawk.\n\nBarr's achievements as a combat pilot earned him the Distinguished Flying Cross and Bar. Shortly after taking command of No. 3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by Axis forces, and incarcerated in Italy. He escaped and assisted other Allied fugitives to safety, receiving for his efforts the Military Cross, a rare honour for an RAAF pilot. Repatriated to England, he saw action during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with No. 2 Operational Training Unit. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953. From the early 1960s he was heavily involved in the oilseed industry, for which he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1983. He died in 2006, aged 90.\n\nAndrew Barr was born in Wellington, New Zealand, on 10 December 1915; he had a twin brother, Jack. The family moved to Australia when the boys were six. Growing up in Melbourne, Andrew attended Kew Public School and played Australian rules football. He was also the Victorian Schoolboys' 100 yards athletics champion three years in succession, from 1926 to 1928. In 1931, aged fifteen, he began his association with the Lord Somers Camp and Power House social and sporting organisations located at Western Port. After leaving school, Barr studied construction at Swinburne Technical College, but later took a diploma course in accountancy and made it his profession. He started playing rugby union in 1935 through a friend in the Power House club. Weighing and just under tall, Barr gained selection for Victoria as a hooker the following year. In 1939, he was chosen to play in the United Kingdom with the Australian national team, the Wallabies. The tour was cancelled less than a day after the team arrived in the UK on 2 September, due to the outbreak of World War II. Keen to serve as a fighter pilot, Barr initially tried to enlist in the Royal Air Force, but withdrew his application when told that it was unlikely he would fly anytime in the near future, and that he could expect only administrative duties in the interim.\n\nReturning to Australia on the RMS \"Strathaird\", Barr joined the Royal Australian Air Force as an air cadet on 4 March 1940. After undergoing instruction on Tiger Moths at No. 3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon, and on Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons at No. 1 Service Flying Training School, Point Cook, he was commissioned as a pilot officer on 24 September. He gained a reputation as something of a rebel during training, and became forever known as \"Nicky\", for \"Old Nick\", or the Devil. In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students. By November 1940, he had been posted to No. 23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron, flying CAC Wirraways on patrol off the Queensland coast. The aircraft was, according to Barr, \"our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes that we were going to encounter, left much to be desired\". Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was grateful to have this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson, and also captained the RAAF rugby union team. He was promoted to flying officer on 24 March 1941.\n\nBarr was posted to North Africa on 28 September 1941, to fly with No. 3 Squadron under the command of Squadron Leader Peter Jeffrey. He converted to P-40 Tomahawk fighters at an RAF operational training unit in Khartoum. There he also received his \"goolie chit\", a piece of paper to be shown to local tribesmen in the event he was shot down, reading in Arabic: \"don't kill the bearer, feed him and protect him, take him to the English and you will be rewarded. Peace be upon you.\" Returning to North Africa, Barr achieved his first aerial victory, over a Messerschmitt Bf 110, on 12 December. He followed this up with a Junkers Ju 88 and a Messerschmitt Bf 109 the next day. The squadron then re-equipped with P-40 Kittyhawks; Barr was flying the new model when he became an ace on New Year's Day 1942, shooting down two Junkers Ju 87 \"Stukas\". On 8 March, he led a flight of six Kittyhawks to intercept a raid on Tobruk by twelve Ju 87s escorted by ten Macchi C. 202s and two Bf 109s. The Australians destroyed six Macchis and three Ju 87s without loss, Barr personally accounting for one of the Macchis.\n\nEventually credited with victories over twelve enemy aircraft, plus two probables and eight damaged, Barr became No. 3 Squadron's highest-scoring member. He flew a total of eighty-four combat sorties, twenty of them in one fortnight, and six on 16 June 1942 alone. His philosophy was that the P-40 was not a top-class fighter, but that its shortcomings \"could be offset by unbridled aggression\", so he resolved to treat aerial combat as he would a boxing match and \"overcome much better opponents by simply going for them\". Bobby Gibbes became No. 3 Squadron's commanding officer in February 1942, and made Barr his senior flight commander. Promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 April, Barr was raised to acting squadron leader and appointed to command the unit in May, barely six months after he commenced operations, following Gibbes's hospitalisation with a broken ankle. Barr had never sought leadership of the squadron, and felt that others were just as well qualified for the role. As a commander he delegated most administrative tasks to his adjutant but, contrary to normal practice, wrote letters to the next-of-kin of casualties himself.\nThree times while serving with No. 3 Squadron, Barr was himself shot down. The first occasion was on 11 January 1942 when, having destroyed a Bf 109 and a Fiat G.50, he was preparing to touch down in the desert to pick up a fellow pilot who had crash landed. He had his undercarriage halfway down when he was \"jumped\" by two other Bf 109s. He immediately engaged both and shot one down before more German fighters arrived and he was hit and forced to land behind enemy lines. As one of the German planes came in low to strafe the downed Kittyhawk, Barr ran straight at it in an attempt to throw the pilot off his aim, and was injured by fragments of rock sent airborne by impact from cannon shells. A tribe of friendly Senussi Arabs found him, dressed his wounds, and helped him return to Allied lines. For this exploit, and his earlier successes, Barr was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC), the full citation being published in the \"London Gazette\" on 20 February 1942:\n\nOn 25 May 1942, Barr had to land in the desert when his engine overheated. Having just taken off the engine cowling, he spotted enemy tanks approaching and immediately took off with the engine exposed to the elements, safely landing back at base. He was shot down for the second time on 30 May, when he engaged eight Bf 109s and destroyed one before being hit and forced to crash land at high speed in no-man's land. He came down in a minefield during a fierce tank battle, and was forced to remain where he was as troops of both sides slowly converged on him; British forces managed to reach him first and, after treatment for wounds, he again returned to his squadron. On 26 June, however, after being attacked by two Bf 109s and bailing out of his burning Kittyhawk, he was captured by Italian soldiers and taken as a prisoner-of-war, first to Tobruk, and then to Italy, where he received hospital treatment for serious wounds. He later learned that the pilot who shot him down was Oberleutnant Werner Schroer, a Luftwaffe ace credited with sixty-one victories in North Africa. Bobby Gibbes, having recovered from his own injuries, again took command of No. 3 Squadron. During his incarceration, on 5 February 1943, Barr was awarded a Bar to his DFC for \"destroying further enemy aircraft\".\nBarr tried to escape from his confinement four times. By November 1942 he had recovered sufficiently from the injuries he received in June to break out of the hospital where he was being held in Bergamo, northern Italy. He made his way to the Swiss border, but was challenged by an Italian customs official, whom he struck with a rock before being recaptured. Court-martialled on a charge of murder, he only avoided a death sentence when the Swiss Red Cross colonel representing him located the official and proved that he had not died. Barr was instead sentenced to ninety days solitary confinement in Gavi Prison Camp, Genoa. In August 1943, with Italy on the verge of surrender, prisoners of war were rounded up for transport to Germany. Barr jumped from a moving train bound for the Brenner Pass and joined a group of Italian partisans in Pontremoli, remaining at large for two months before again being captured. Taken to a transit camp just over the Austrian border, Barr and fourteen other prisoners escaped by tunnelling under the barbed wire. Eventually he managed to link up with an Allied special operations unit, which was gathering intelligence behind enemy lines, sabotaging Axis infrastructure, and helping Allied prisoners and Italian refugees escape over the Apennine Mountains along the so-called \"Alpine Route\". He was recaptured and escaped once more before finally making it through the Alpine crossing himself, leading a group of more than twenty. After reaching friendly lines in March 1944, he was sent to a military hospital in Vasto, weighing only and in poor health, suffering malaria, malnutrition, and blood poisoning. The assistance he rendered to fellow Allied fugitives earned him the Military Cross (MC) for \"Exceptional courage in organising escapes\"; the award was gazetted on 1 December 1944. He is thought to be one of only five or six RAAF pilots to receive the MC during World War II.\n\nPosted to Britain in April 1944, Barr went ashore at Omaha Beach two days after D-Day as part of an air support control unit. During the campaign in Normandy, he flew rocket-armed Hawker Typhoons on operations against V-1 flying bomb launch sites. After his return to Australia on 11 September, Barr was promoted to acting wing commander and appointed chief instructor at No. 2 Operational Training Unit in Mildura, Victoria, taking over from Bobby Gibbes. He also went to New Guinea and flew some ground-attack missions in the Kittyhawk to gain experience in the South West Pacific theatre. Following the end of hostilities in August 1945, Barr was treated for recurring fever and underwent two operations on his limbs in No. 6 RAAF Hospital, Heidelberg. He was discharged from the Air Force on 8 October.\n\nAfter leaving the Air Force, Barr remained in Mildura with his wife, Dorothy (Dot). They had met on a blind date in 1938 and been married only a few weeks when Nicky joined the RAAF. During the war she was told on three occasions that her husband was dead. The couple had two sons, born in 1945 and 1947. Barr's injuries prevented him from returning to a rugby career, and he took up yachting as a sport. He also briefly assisted fellow No. 3 Squadron veteran Bobby Gibbes in an airline venture in New Guinea, before going into business as a company manager and director with civil engineering and pharmaceutical firms. Barr rejoined the RAAF on 20 March 1951 as a pilot in the active Citizen Air Force (CAF), with the acting rank of wing commander. On 15 April 1953, he transferred to the CAF reserve. A member of the Royal Air Forces Escaping Society, Barr began travelling to Italy with his wife on a regular basis in the late 1950s to seek out and offer assistance to those who had helped him during his wartime escape attempts.\n\nIn 1961, Barr became General Manager of Meggitt Ltd, an oilseed-crushing firm; he eventually rose to become Executive Chairman. The firm's board was joined in 1971 by the recently retired Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sir Alister Murdoch. Barr's work in the industry led to his appointment in the 1983 New Year Honours as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE). The same year, he became Australian representative and Chairman of the International Oil Seed Group. In June 1987, Barr accepted an invitation to join John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, and fifteen other famed flyers in a so-called \"Gathering of Eagles\" for a seminar at the USAF Air Command and Staff College in Montgomery, Alabama. Generally reluctant to talk publicly about the war, he agreed to discuss his experiences during an episode of the television series \"Australian Story\" in 2002, appearing with his biographer Peter Dornan, and Bobby Gibbes. By this time Barr was said to be receiving daily treatment for the injuries he had suffered in combat. He died at the age of ninety on 12 June 2006, a few months after his wife. Four F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters from No. 3 Squadron overflew his funeral service on the Gold Coast, Queensland. He was further honoured at a rugby test match between Australia and England at Telstra Dome in Melbourne on 17 June, the day after his funeral. On 14 September 2006, No. 3 Squadron dedicated a stone memorial in Barr's honour; the unveiling was attended by his sons Bob and Brian.\n\n\n"}

Race pickup trucks are mechanically similar to coupé-shaped stock cars, with the main difference being the more boxy shape of the cab, which does not give as good aerodynamics as stock cars.\n\nNASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series vehicles have been rapidly evolving since the inception of the series in 1995, in terms of speed, aerodynamics, and engine equipment. The NASCAR series was also the first to use this type of vehicle, unveiled in 1994.\n\nThe concept of pickup truck racing started in 1983 when former NASCAR driver Buck Baker established the National Pickup Truck Racing Association to help Buck Baker Driving School graduates start their careers. The series, which did not plan to have a points system, had a ten-race schedule planned with intentions to sell the series to NASCAR. The trucks were built with a 1981 NASCAR Winston Cup Series car base; the four-barrel Cup Series carburetors were reduced to two to decrease speeds. The series began to increase in popularity, and the schedule was increased to eleven races. After the season ended, Baker's attempted sale of the series to NASCAR was denied, and was sold to Dick Moroso, with the series being rebranded the Moroso Performance All-Pro Pickup Truck Series.\n\nIn 1991, SCORE International racers Dick Landfield, Jimmy Smith, Jim Venable and Frank \"Scoop\" Vessels unveiled plans to create a pickup truck series for NASCAR. Three years later, the trucks were unveiled at the 1994 Daytona 500, and officially created as the SuperTruck Series. After hosting seven exhibition races, the series held its first season in 1995. The series, now known as the NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series, is one of three national series sanctioned by NASCAR (besides the Monster Energy Cup Series and Xfinity Series).\n\n"}
{"id": "4806848", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4806848", "title": "Predictions of the dissolution of the Soviet Union", "text": "Predictions of the dissolution of the Soviet Union\n\nThere were people and organizations who predicted that the USSR would fall before the eventual dissolution of the USSR in 1991.\n\nAuthors often credited with having predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union include Andrei Amalrik in \"Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?\" (1970), French academic Emmanuel Todd in \"La chute finale: Essais sur la décomposition de la sphère Soviétique (The Final Fall: An essay on the decomposition of the Soviet sphere)\" (1976), economist Ravi Batra in his 1978 book \"The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism\" and French historian Hélène Carrère d'Encausse. Additionally, Walter Laqueur notes that \"Various articles that appeared in professional journals such as \"Problems of Communism\" and \"Survey\" dealt with the decay and the possible downfall of the Soviet regime.\" Some US conservatives view Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative as not only predicting but causing the dissolution of the USSR.\n\nWhether any particular prediction was \"correct\" is still a matter of debate, since they give different reasons and different time frames for the Soviet collapse.\n\nPredictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise were discounted by many Western academic specialists, and had little impact on mainstream Sovietology. For example, Amalrik's book \"was welcomed as a piece of brilliant literature in the West\" but \"virtually no one tended to take it at face value as a piece of political prediction.\" Up to about 1980, the strength of the Soviet Union was widely overrated by critics and revisionists alike.\n\nIn 1983, Princeton University professor Stephen Cohen described the Soviet system as remarkably stable.\n\nThe Central Intelligence Agency also badly over-estimated the internal stability of the Soviet Union, and did not anticipate the speed of its collapse. Former DCI Stansfield Turner in 1991 wrote in the US Journal \"Foreign Affairs\", \"We should not gloss over the enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis . . . Yet I never heard a suggestion from the CIA, or the intelligence arms of the departments of Defense or State, that numerous Soviets recognized a growing, systemic economic problem.\"\n\nIn a symposium launched to review Michel Garder's French book: \"L'Agonie du Regime en Russie Sovietique\" (\"The Death Struggle of the Regime in Soviet Russia\"), which also predicted the collapse of the USSR, Yale Professor Frederick C. Barghoorn dismissed Garder's book as \"the latest in a long line of apocalyptic predictions of the collapse of communism.\" He warns that \"great revolutions are most infrequent and that successful political systems are tenacious and adaptive.\" In addition, the reviewer of the book, Michael Tatu, disapproved of the \"apocalyptic character\" of such a forecast and is almost apologetic for treating it seriously.\n\nAnalysts, organizations and politicians who predicted that the Soviet Union would one day cease to exist included:\n\nThe Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises argued in his 1921 book \"\" that the Soviet system was unsustainable and would eventually collapse. This book was published months before Lenin implemented the New Economic Policy reintroducing partial private property in agriculture. Mises' analysis was based on the economic calculation problem, a critique of central planning first outlined in 1920 journal articles. His argument was that the Soviet Union would find itself increasingly unable to set correct prices for the goods and services it produced:\n\nWe may admit that in its initial period a socialist regime could to some extent rely on the preceding age of capitalism [for the purpose of determining prices]. But what is to be done later, as conditions change more and more? Of what use could the prices of 1900 be for the director in 1949? And what use can the director in 1989 derive from knowledge of the prices of 1949?\n\nOne of the founders of the USSR, later expelled by Joseph Stalin, Leon Trotsky devoted much of his time in exile to the question of the Soviet Union's future. In time, he came to believe that a new revolution was necessary to depose the nomenklatura and reinstate working class rule as the first step to socialism. In 1936 he made the following prediction:\n\nIn 1941 Adolf Hitler of Nazi Germany decided to attack the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). In June 1941 the German Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union, and the Red Army retreated.\n\nMilitary observers around the world watched closely. It appears that most of them shared Hitler's opinion, expecting Germany to win, destroy the Soviet system, and establish its New Order in Europe. Very few American experts thought the Soviet Union would survive. After the beginning of the German invasion, the United States Department of War advised Franklin D. Roosevelt that the German army would conquer the Soviet Union within one to three months. In July 1941, the American general staff issued memoranda to the American press that a Soviet collapse was to be expected within several weeks. British analysts also shared this view, believing that Germany would win within three to six weeks without heavy losses. Negative predictions had an important impact on President Roosevelt; while the United States was not at the time at war, he favored the Allies (Britain and the Soviet Union), and decided to try to avert the collapse of the USSR by supplying them with munitions through Lend-Lease, and also to pressure Japan not to attack while the USSR was so vulnerable. The Red Army held the line at the outskirts of Moscow and predictions changed to \"uncertain.\"\n\nGeorge Orwell, author of \"Animal Farm\" and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", wrote in 1946 that \"the Russian regime will either democratize itself or it will perish\". He was regarded by US historian Robert Conquest as one of the first people who made such a prediction. According to a Conquest article published in 1969, \"In time, the Communist world is faced with a fundamental crisis. We can not say for certain that it will democratize itself. But every indication is that it will, as Orwell said, either democratize itself or perish...We must also, though, be prepared to cope with cataclysmic changes, for the death throes of the more backward apparatus may be destructive and dangerous\".\n\nAmerican diplomat George F. Kennan proposed his famous containment theory in 1946–47, arguing that, if the Soviet Union were not allowed to expand, it would soon collapse. In the X Article he wrote:\nThe United States would have to undertake this containment alone and unilaterally, but if it could do so without undermining its own economic health and political stability, the Soviet party structure would undergo a period of immense strain eventually resulting in \"either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.\"\n\nKennan later regretted the manner in which his theory was received and implemented, but it nevertheless became a core element of American strategy, which consisted of building a series of military alliances around the USSR.\n\nWinston Churchill made repeated claims about the imminent fall of the Soviet Union throughout his political career. In January 1920, he denounced Bolshevism as a \"rule of men who in their insane vanity and conceit believe they are entitled to give a government to a people which the people loathe and detest... The attempt to carry into practice those wild theories can only be attended with universal confusion, corruption, disorder and civil war.\" Later, he made a similar prediction in a journal article in 1931. After World War II, speaking about the recently established Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe, he stated in 1954: \"The forces of the human spirit and of national character alive in those countries cannot be speedily extinguished even by large-scale movements of populations and mass education of children.\" And in the epilogue to the one volume edition of his World War II memoirs, published in 1957, Churchill wrote: \"The natural forces are working with greater freedom and greater opportunity to fertilize and vary the thoughts and the power of individual men and women. They are far bigger and more pliant in the vast structure of a mighty empire than could ever have been conceived by Marx in his hovel... Human society will grow in many forms not comprehended by a party machine.\"\n\nZbigniew Brzezinski, National Security Advisor to U.S. President Jimmy Carter, predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union on several occasions. In a 2006 interview, Brzezinski stated that in his 1950 master's thesis (which has not been published) he argued that \"the Soviet Union was pretending to be a single state but in fact it was a multinational empire in the age of nationalism. So the Soviet Union would break up.\"\n\nAs an academic at Columbia University, Brzezinski wrote numerous books and articles that \"took seriously the option of collapse\", including \"Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics\" (1969) and \"Between Two Ages: America's Role in the Technetronic Era\" (1970).\n\n\"Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics\" contained fourteen articles dealing with the future of the Soviet Union. Six of them, by Brzezinski himself, Robert Conquest, Merle Fainsod, Eugene Lyons, Giorgio Galli, and Isaac Don Levine, considered \"collapse as a serious possibility although not immediately.\" \n\nOn the other hand, in 1976 Brzezinski predicted that the politics of the Soviet Union would be practically unchanged for several more generations to come:\n\nA central question, however, is whether such social change <nowiki>[</nowiki>modernization<nowiki>]</nowiki> is capable of altering, or has in fact already altered in a significant fashion, the underlying character of Soviet politics. That character, as I have argued, has been shaped largely by political traditions derived from the specifics of Russian / Soviet history, and it is deeply embedded in the operational style and institutions of the existing Soviet system. The ability of that system to resist de-Stalinization seems to indicate a considerable degree of resilience on the part of the dominant mode of politics in the Soviet context. It suggests, at the very least, that political changes are produced very slowly through social change, and that one must wait for at least several generations before social change begins to be significantly reflected in the political sphere.\n\nIn 1989, shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet power throughout Eastern Europe, Brzezinski published \"The Grand Failure: The Birth and Decay of Communism in the Twentieth Century\". In that work he wrote:\n\nMarxist-Leninism is an alien doctrine imposed on the region by an imperial power whose rule is culturally repugnant to the dominated peoples. As a result, a process of organic rejection of communism by Eastern European societies – a phenomenon similar to the human body's rejection of a transplanted organ – is underway.\"\n\nBrzezinski went on to claim that communism \"failed to take into account the basic human craving for individual freedom.\" He argued there were five possibilities for USSR:\nOption #5 in fact took place three years later, but at the time he wrote that collapse was \"at this stage a much more remote possibility\" than alternative #3: renewed stagnation. He also predicted chances of some form of communism existing in the Soviet Union in 2017 was a little more than 50%. Finally when the end did come in a few more decades, Brzezinski wrote, it would be \"most likely turbulent.\"\n\nFerenc Farkas de Kisbarnak, an exiled Hungarian general and leader of the Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations (ABN), predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union due to nationalist pressures. From June 12–14 of 1950, the Convention of the ABN was held in Edinburgh, Scotland under the auspices of the Scottish League for European Freedom. At the conference, Farkas gave a speech entitled \"The War Against Bolshevism and the Military Factors Represented by the Subjugated Nations\" where he predicted the disintegration of the USSR along ethnic lines which would eventually leave European Russia isolated. He predicted the eventual independence of Ukraine, the Baltic states, Turkestan, the Idel-Ural republics, and Siberia. The third resolution of the ABN convention further called for \"The destruction of Russian imperialism and the guarantee of world peace by splitting the USSR up and re-establishing on ethnic principles, the independent national states of all nations living under bolshevist oppression bearing among other things, in mind that whole national groups have been forcible [sic] deported and are awaiting the moment when they could return to their native land.\"\n\nOnly a handful of thinkers, ranging from French President Charles de Gaulle to the Soviet dissident Andrei Amalrik, foretold the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union itself, and even they saw it as likely to happen as a result of disastrous wars with China or pressures from the Islamic Soviet states of Central Asia.\n\nOn 23 November 1959, in a speech in Strasbourg, de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe: \"\" (\"Yes, it is Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals, it is Europe, it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.\") This phrase has been interpreted in various ways—on the one hand, as offering détente to the USSR, on the other, as predicting the collapse of communism throughout Eastern Europe.\n\nKonrad Adenauer has been cited predicting the reunification of Germany as early as the 1950s, but according to Hans-Peter Schwarz, in the last few years of Adenauer's life he repeatedly said that Soviet power would last a long time.\n\nIn 1966, at the Christian Democrats' party conference, Adenauer stated his hopes that some day the Soviets might allow the reunification of Germany. Some analysts say it might be considered a prediction:\n\nI have not given up hope. One day Soviet Russia will recognize that the division of Germany, and with it the division of Europe, is not to its advantage. We must be watchful for when the moment comes... we must not let it go unexploited.\n\nIn a posthumously published 1964 book entitled \"Cold Friday\", Communist defector Whittaker Chambers predicted an eventual Soviet collapse beginning with a \"satellite revolution\" in Eastern Europe. This revolution would then result in the transformation of the Soviet dictatorship.\n\nMichel Garder was a French author who predicted the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the book \"L'Agonie du Regime en Russie Sovietique\" (\"The Death Struggle of the Regime in Soviet Russia\") (1965). He set the date of the collapse for 1970.\n\nIn 1968 Egon Neuberger, of the RAND Corporation, predicted that \"[t]he centrally planned economy eventually would meet its demise, because of its demonstrably growing ineffectiveness as a system for managing a modernizing economy in a rapidly changing world.\"\n\nIn the book \"Dilemmas of Change in Soviet Politics\", which was a collection of authors edited by Zbigniew Brzezinski, Robert Conquest in his section, \"Immobilism and decay\", saw \"the USSR as a country where the political system is radically and dangerously inappropriate to its social and economic dynamics. This is a formula for change - change which may be sudden and catastrophic.\"\n\nConquest also predicted the fall in his book, \"The Nation Killers: The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities\" (1970).\n\nSun Myung Moon, founder of the Unification Church repeatedly predicted that Communism was inherently flawed and would inevitably collapse sometime in the late 1980s. In a speech to followers in Paris in April 1972, he stated:\n\n\"Communism, begun in 1917, could maintain itself approximately 60 years and reach its peak. So 1978 is the borderline and afterward communism will decline; in the 70th year it will be altogether ruined. This is true. Therefore now is the time for people who are studying communism to abandon it.\" \n\nIn 1969, prominent dissident Andrei Amalrik wrote in his book \"Will the Soviet Union Survive Until 1984?\":\n\nAmalrik predicted the collapse of the regime would occur between 1980 and 1985. The year in the title was after the novel of the same name.\n\nSoviet authorities were skeptical. Natan Sharansky explained that \"in 1984 KGB officials, on coming to me in prison\" when Amalrik's prediction was mentioned, \"laughed at this prediction. Amalrik is long dead, they said, but we are still very much present.\"\n\nHistorian Marian Kamil Dziewanowski \"gave a lecture titled 'Death of the Soviet Regime' at the Russian Research Center at Harvard University. The same lecture was delivered at Cambridge University in England in 1971 and 1979. The text of the lecture (titled 'Death of the Soviet Regime: a Study in American Sovietology, by a Historian') was published in \"Studies in Soviet Thought\". In 1980, he \"updated this study and delivered it as a paper at the International Slavic Congress at Garmish; titled 'The Future of Soviet Russia,' it was published in \"Coexistence: An International Journal\" (Glasgow 1982).\"\n\nEmmanuel Todd attracted attention in 1976 when he predicted the fall of the Soviet Union, based on indicators such as increasing infant mortality rates: \"La chute finale: Essais sur la décomposition de la sphère Soviétique\" (The Final Fall: an Essay on the Disintegration of the Soviet Sphere).\n\nBernard Levin drew attention in 1992 to his prophetic article originally published in \"The Times\" in September 1977, in which an uncannily accurate prediction of the appearance of new faces in the Politburo was made, resulting in radical but peaceful political change.\n\nU.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in a series of articles and interviews from 1975 onward discussed the possibility, indeed likelihood, of the breakup of the Soviet Empire. But Moynihan also expressed the view that liberal democracy, too, faced an uncertain future. He argued in January 1975 that the Soviet Union was so weak economically, and so divided ethnically, that it could not long survive. However he said it \"might have considerable time left before ethnicity breaks it up.\" By 1984 he argued \"the Soviet idea is spent.\nHistory is moving away from it at astounding speed.\" Some of his essays were published as \"Secrecy: The American Experience\" in 1999.\n\nIn her 1978 book \"L'Empire éclaté\", historian (and later member of the Académie française and the European Parliament) Hélène Carrère d'Encausse predicted that the Soviet Union's political legitimacy would be fatally strained by diverging fertility between its culturally Russian/Eastern European parts (dominant in government and industry but with plummeting birth rates) and its culturally Asian and/or Muslim parts (with growing birth rates but little representation in the established \"gerontocracy\"). \"L'Empire éclaté\" generated substantial media interest at the time, winning the 1978 .\n\nVarious essays published in samizdat in the early 1970s were on similar lines, some quite specifically predicting the end of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1973 the Marxist, Hillel H. Ticktin, wrote that the Soviet \"system is sinking deeper into crisis\". In 1976 he entitled an article: \"The USSR: the Beginning of the End?\". In 1978 he predicted that the Soviet Union would \"break asunder and develop either to capitalism or to socialism\". And in 1983 he wrote that \"the system is drawing to a close\". (For a summary of Ticktin's approach, see Wikipedia's Stalinism entry.)\n\nDavid Fromkin wrote of Raymond Aron's prediction,\n\nI know of only one person who came close to getting it right: Raymond Aron, the French philosopher and liberal anti-Communist. In a talk on the Soviet threat that I heard him give in the 1980s at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, he reminded the audience of Machiavelli's observation in \"The Prince\" that 'all armed prophets have conquered and all unarmed ones failed.' But what happens, Aron asked, if the prophet, having conquered and then ruled by force of arms, loses faith in his own prophecy? In the answer to that question, Aron suggested, lay the key to understanding the future of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe economist Ravi Batra predicted the collapse of the USSR in his 1978 book \"The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism\".\n\nIn 1980 the sociologist Randall Collins presented his paper \"The future decline of the Russian empire\" at the University of South Florida and at Columbia University and published his predictions in the book \"Weberian sociological theory\" (1986).\n\nIn 1980, the political scientist Robert M. Cutler published an article \"Soviet Dissent under Khrushchev\" that concluded that the following events were likely: (1) that in the generational turnover of elites after Brezhnev died (which began when he died in 1982), the Soviet regime would seek to increase public participation (which began in 1985 via glasnost, after 2 more top gerontocrats had died); (2) that the Communist Party's rule would be challenged in Central Asia (which occurred in the 1986 rioting in Kazakhstan before the Baltic republics erupted); and (3) that Party leaders at the local level would go their own way if the Party did not give them a reason to remain loyal to the Moscow center (which occurred in all republics in the late 1980s, but most dramatically when the new RCP and RSFSR sapped some of the power of the CPSU and USSR in 1990-1991).\n\nJames Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg predicted the collapse of the Soviet\nUnion in their book The Great Reckoning in the early 1980s.\n\nStewart Brand said when introducing the work of Philip Tetlock that Brand's partner had given a talk in the 1980s to top Central Intelligence Agency people about the future of the Soviet Union. One scenario he raised was that the Soviet bloc might break up; a sign of this happening would be the rise of unknown Mikhail Gorbachev through the party ranks. A CIA analyst said that the presentation was fine, but there was no way the Soviet Union was going to break up in his lifetime or his children's lifetime. The analyst's name was Robert Gates.\n\nOn the other hand, in hearings before the U.S. Senate on March 19, 1986, when Gates (then head of the CIA's Directorate of Intelligence) was asked \"what kind of work the Intelligence Community was doing to prepare policymakers for the consequences of change in the Soviet Union,\" he responded: \"Quite frankly, without any hint that such fundamental change is going on, my resources do not permit me the luxury of sort of just idly speculating on what a different kind of Soviet Union might look like.\"\n\nIn 1984, Anatoliy Golitsyn, an important KGB defector published the book \"New Lies For Old\", wherein he predicted the collapse of the communist bloc orchestrated from above.\n\nHe claimed this collapse was part of a long-term deception strategy designed to lull the West into a false sense of security, abolish all containment policies, and in time finally economically cripple and diplomatically isolate the United States.\n\nAmong other things, Golitsyn stated:\n\nCollaborating opinions can be found in an archive of classified documents collected by Vladimir Bukovsky, a defector also.\n\nJohn le Carré is a writer of fiction, but his \"spy novels\" are known for their keen insights on East-West relations in general and conflicts between Western and Soviet intelligence services in particular. In \"The Russia House\", published on May 22, 1989, there is the telling quote: \"The Soviet Knight is dying inside his armour.\"\n\nIn 1985 German economist Werner Obst published a book entitled \"Der Rote Stern verglüht. Moskaus Abstieg - Deutschlands Chance\" (The Red Star is Dying Away. Moscow's Decline - Germany's Chance), Munich: Wirtschaftsverlag Langen-Müller/Herbig, third edition in 1987, in which he predicted the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the reunification of Germany within the immediate future for about 1990, based on the analysis of economical statistics and trends.\n\nUnited States President Ronald Reagan, throughout his 1980 election campaign and first term in office presented a public view that the Soviet Union had been growing in power relative to the United States. In 1981 he stated that \"the Soviet Union has been engaged in the greatest military buildup in the history of man.\" and the next year stated that \"on balance the Soviet Union does have a definite margin of superiority\" compared to the U.S. military.\n\nThe Reagan administration used a perceived strength of the Soviet Union to justify a significant expansion of military spending according to David Arbel and Ran Edelist. In their study \"Western Intelligence and the dissolution of the Soviet Union\" they argue it was this position by the Reagan administration that prevented the American intelligence agencies from predicting the demise of the USSR. Arbel and Edelist further argued that CIA analysts were encouraged to present any information exaggerating the Soviet threat and justifying the military buildup, while contrary evidence of Soviet weakness was ignored and those presenting it sidelined.\n\nAt the same time Reagan expressed a long range view that the Soviet Union could eventually be defeated. On March 3, 1983, President Reagan told the National Association of Evangelicals in Orlando, Florida: \"I believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last — last pages even now are being written.\"\n\nIn his June 1982 address to the British Parliament he stated:\n\nIt is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than half of what it was then. The dimensions of this failure are astounding: A country which employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might be on the brink of famine... Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year after year the Soviet system pours its best resource into the making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of economic growth combined with the growth of military production is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic base, a society where productive forces are hampered by political ones. ...In the Communist world as well, man's instinctive desire for freedom and self-determination surfaces again and again. To be sure, there are grim reminders of how brutally the police state attempts to snuff out this quest for self-rule – 1953 in East Germany, 1956 in Hungary, 1968 in Czechoslovakia, 1981 in Poland. But the struggle continues in Poland. And we know that there are even those who strive and suffer for freedom within the confines of the Soviet Union itself. ...What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term – the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people. And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO even as we move forward with our Zero-Option initiative in the negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.\n\nAnalyst Jeffrey W. Knopf has argued that Reagan went beyond everyone else:\n\nReagan stands out in part because he believed the Soviet Union could be defeated. For most of the Cold War, Republican and Democratic administrations alike had assumed the Soviet Union would prove durable for the foreseeable future. The bipartisan policy of containment aimed to keep the Soviet Union in check while trying to avoid nuclear war; it did not seek to force the dissolution of the Soviet empire. Ronald Reagan, in contrast, believed that the Soviet economy was so weak that increased pressure could bring the Soviet Union to the brink of failure. He therefore periodically expressed confidence that the forces of democracy 'will leave Marxism-Leninism on the ash heap of history'.\n\nThe leader of the Ananda Marga cult in West Bengal, P.R. Sarkar, predicted in the 1980s that Soviet Communism would fall with \"a few blows from the hammer\". He cited \"inner and external stasis\" as major weaknesses of communism.\n\nOn 7 January 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, supreme leader of the Iran, sent a letter to Mikhail Gorbachev, the General Secretary of the Soviet Union. This letter was Khomeini's only written message to a foreign leader. Khomeini's letter was delivered by the Iranian politicians Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, Mohammad-Javad Larijani, and Marzieh Hadidchi. In the letter, Khomeini declared that Communism was dissolving within the Soviet bloc, and invited Gorbachev to consider Islam as an alternative to communist ideology.\n\nAccording to Kevin Brennan:\n\nSeymour Martin Lipset and György Bence write:\n\nRichard Pipes took a slightly different view, situating the failure of the Sovietological profession in the larger context of the failures of Social Science:\n\nIt seems likely that ultimately the reason for the failure of professionals to understand the Soviet predicament lay in their indifference to the human factor. In the desire to emulate the successes of the natural scientists, whose judgments are \"value free,\" politology (sic) and sociology have been progressively dehumanized, constructing model and relying on statistics (many of them falsified) and, in the process, losing contact with the subject of their inquiries—the messy, contradictory, unpredictable homo sapiens.\n\n\n"}

The term Annamiticus derives from the Annamite name of the Indochinese Mountains in Indochina, part of the distribution of this species, also known as the Javanese Javan rhinoceros or simply Vietnamese rhinoceros for Vietnam.\n\n\"R. sondaicus annamiticus\" once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia. The subspecific name \"R.s. annamiticus\" is derived from the Annamite Mountain Range in Southeast Asia, which was part of its range. In 2006, a single population, estimated at fewer than 12 remaining rhinos, lived in an area of seasonal tropical forest of Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam. Genetic analysis suggested this subspecies and the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros last shared a common ancestor between 300,000 and 2 million years ago. The last known individual of this population was shot by a poacher in 2010, and some conservation groups believe that the subspecies is extinct.\n\nAs with many other species, the two main factors in the decline of the Javan rhinoceros populations has been loss of habitat combined with over-hunting. Poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Because the rhinoceros' final range encompassed an area of human poverty, it was difficult to convince local people not to kill an animal which could be sold for an enormous sum of money.\n"}
{"id": "1643552", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1643552", "title": "Saint Joan (play)", "text": "Saint Joan (play)\n\nSaint Joan is a play by George Bernard Shaw about 15th century French military figure Joan of Arc. Premiering in 1923, three years after her canonization by the Roman Catholic Church, the play dramatises what is known of her life based on the substantial records of her trial. Shaw studied the transcripts and decided that the concerned people acted in good faith according to their beliefs. He wrote in his preface to the play:\n\nThere are no villains in the piece. Crime, like disease, is not interesting: it is something to be done away with by general consent, and that is all [there is] about it. It is what men do at their best, with good intentions, and what normal men and women find that they must and will do in spite of their intentions, that really concern us.\n\nMichael Holroyd has characterised the play as \"a tragedy without villains\" and also as Shaw's \"only tragedy\". John Fielden has discussed further the appropriateness of characterising \"Saint Joan\" as a tragedy.\n\nThe text of the published play includes a long Preface by Shaw.\n\n\nShaw characterised \"Saint Joan\" as \"A Chronicle Play in 6 Scenes and an Epilogue \". Joan, a simple peasant girl, claims to experience visions of Saint Margaret, Saint Catherine, and the archangel Michael, which she says were sent by God to guide her conduct.\n\nScene 1 (23 February 1429): Robert de Baudricourt complains about the inability of the hens on his farm to produce eggs. Joan claims that her voices are telling her to lift the siege of Orléans, and to allow her several of his men for this purpose. Joan also says that she will crown the Dauphin in Reims Cathedral. De Baudricourt ridicules Joan, but his Steward feels inspired by her words. De Baudricourt eventually begins to feel the same sense of inspiration, and gives his consent to Joan. The Steward enters at the end of the scene to exclaim that the hens have begun to lay eggs again. De Baudricourt interprets this as a sign from God of Joan's divine inspiration.\n\nScene 2 (8 March 1429): Joan talks her way into being received at the court of the weak and vain Dauphin. There, she tells him that her voices have commanded her to help him become a true king by rallying his troops to drive out the English occupiers and restore France to greatness. Joan succeeds in doing this through her excellent powers of flattery, negotiation, leadership, and skill on the battlefield.\n\nScene 3 (29 April 1429): Dunois and his page are waiting for the wind to turn so that he and his forces can lay siege to Orléans. Joan and Dunois commiserate, and Dunois attempts to explain to her more pragmatic realities of an attack, without the wind at their back. Her replies eventually inspire Dunois to rally the forces, and at the scene's end, the wind turns in their favour.\n\nScene 4 (June 1429): Warwick and de Stogumber discuss Joan's stunning series of victories. Joined by the Bishop of Beauvais, they are at a loss to explain her success. De Stogumber decides Joan is a witch. Beauvais sees Joan as a threat to the Church, as she claims to receive instructions from God directly. He fears she wants to instill national pride in the people, which would undermine the Church's universal rule. Warwick thinks she wants to create a system in which the king is responsible to God only, ultimately stripping him and other feudal lords of their power. All agree that she must die.\n\nScene 5 (17 July 1429): the Dauphin is crowned Charles VII at Reims Cathedral. A perplexed Joan asks Dunois why she is so unpopular at court. He explains that she has exposed very important people as incompetent and irrelevant. She talks to him, Bluebeard, and La Hire about returning home. Charles, who complains about the weight of his coronation robes and smell of the holy oil, is pleased to hear this. She then says to Dunois \"Before I go home, let's take Paris\", an idea which horrifies Charles, who wants to negotiate a peace immediately. The Archbishop berates her for her \"sin of pride\". Dunois warns her that if she is captured on a campaign he deems foolhardy, no one will ransom or rescue her. Now realizing that she is \"alone on earth\", Joan declares that she will gain the strength to do what she must from the people and from God. She leaves, leaving the men dumbfounded.\n\nScene 6 (30 May 1431): deals with her trial. De Stogumber is adamant that she be executed at once. The Inquisitor, the Bishop of Beauvais, and the Church officials on both sides of the trial have a long discussion on the nature of her heresy. Joan is brought to the court, and continues to assert that her voices speak to her directly from God and that she has no need of the Church's officials. This outrages de Stogumber. She acquiesces to the pressure of torture at the hands of her oppressors, and agrees to sign a confession relinquishing the truth behind her voices. When she learns she will be imprisoned for life without hope of parole, she renounces her confession:\n\nJoan: \"You think that life is nothing but not being dead? It is not the bread and water I fear. I can live on bread. It is no hardship to drink water if the water be clean. But to shut me from the light of the sky and the sight of the fields and flowers; to chain my feet so that I can never again climb the hills. To make me breathe foul damp darkness, without these things I cannot live. And by your wanting to take them away from me, or from any human creature, I know that your council is of the devil.\"\n\nJoan accepts death at the stake as preferable to such an imprisoned existence. De Stogumber vehemently demands that Joan then be taken to the stake for immediate execution. The Inquisitor and the Bishop of Beauvais excommunicate her and deliver her into the hands of the English. The Inquisitor asserts that Joan was fundamentally innocent, in the sense that she was sincere and had no understanding of the church and the law. De Stogumber re-enters, screaming and severely shaken emotionally after seeing Joan die in the flames, the first time that he has witnessed such a death, and realising that he has not understood what it means to burn a person until he has actually seen it happen. A soldier had given Joan two sticks tied together in a cross before the moment of her death. Bishop Martin Ladvenu also reports that when he approached with a crucifix to let her see it before she died, and he approached too close to the flames, she warned him of the danger from the stake, which convinced him that she could not have been under the inspiration of the devil.\n\nEpilogue: 25 years after Joan's execution, a retrial has cleared her of heresy. Brother Martin brings the news to Charles VII. Charles then has a dream in which Joan appears to him. She begins conversing cheerfully not only with Charles, but with her old enemies, who also materialise in the King's bedroom. An emissary from the present day (the 1920s) brings news that the Catholic Church is to canonise her. Joan says that saints can work miracles, and asks if she can be resurrected. At this, all the characters desert her one by one, asserting that the world is not prepared to receive a saint such as her. The last to leave is the English soldier, who is about to engage in a conversation with Joan before he is summoned back to Hell at the end of his 24-hour respite. The play ends with Joan ultimately despairing that mankind will never accept its saints:\n\nO God that madest this beautiful earth, when will it be ready to accept thy saints? How long, O Lord, how long?\n\nOne historian at the time (1925) reacted to the play by arguing that it was highly inaccurate, especially in its depiction of medieval society.\n\nShaw states that the characterization of Joan by most writers is \"romanticized\" to make her accusers come off as completely unscrupulous and villainous.\n\nMore general interpretation of Joan's character is to describe her as a rebel against general institutional authority, such as that of the Catholic Church and to the feudal system. Contemporary comments have noted her particularly strong form of religious belief and how it borders on religious fanaticism.\n\nTony Stafford discussed Shaw's use of imagery related to birds in the play. Frederick Boas has compared the different treatments of Joan in dramas by Shakespeare, Schiller, and Shaw.\n\nT. S. Eliot, discussing the play after its premiere in London in 1924, wrote that although \"Saint Joan\" was not the masterpiece that some claimed it to be, the play \"seems to illustrate Mr. Shaw's mind more clearly than anything he has written before.\" And although he credited Shaw with providing an \"intellectual stimulant\" and \"dramatic delight\", he took issue with his portrayal of the heroine: \"his Joan of Arc is perhaps the greatest sacrilege of all Joans: for instead of the saint or the strumpet of the legends to which he objects, he has turned her into a great middle-class reformer, and her place is a little higher than Mrs. Pankhurst\" (the militant leader of the British suffragettes).\n\nShaw's personal reputation following the Great War was at a low ebb, and it is thought that he wanted to first test the play away from Britain. The play received its premiere on 28 December 1923 at the Garrick Theatre on Broadway by the Theatre Guild with Winifred Lenihan in the title role. The London première, which opened on 26 March 1924 at the New Theatre, was produced by Lewis Casson and starred Shaw's friend Sybil Thorndike, the actress for whom he had written the part. Costumes and sets were designed by Charles Ricketts, and the play had an extensive musical score, specially composed and conducted by John Foulds.\n\nCaught between the forces of the Church and the Law, Joan is the personification of the tragic heroine and the part is considered by actresses (see below) to be one of the most challenging of roles to interpret. It is usually played by very experienced actresses who are much older than the age of the character, a teenager. For a film version, Joan was exceptionally played by Jean Seberg, who was 19.\n\n\nOther notable Joans include Judi Dench, Zoe Caldwell, Elisabeth Bergner, Constance Cummings, Ann Casson, Roberta Maxwell, Barbara Jefford, Pat Galloway, Sarah Miles, Ellen Geer, Jane Alexander, Lee Grant, Janet Suzman, Maryann Plunkett, Eileen Atkins, Kitty Winn and Sarah Snook.\n\nFilms<br>\n\nStage\n\nSound recordings\n\nOpera<br>\nThe play has also been adapted into an opera by composer Tom Owen.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The Italian-language libretto was by Giacomo Rossi. The story concerns the Roman dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla (138–78 BC) as recounted by Plutarch.\n\nThe opera appears to have been a \"pièce d'occasion\", which may have been performed only once. The music was recycled in Handel's later opera \"Amadigi di Gaula\".\n\nThe first performance might have been on 2 June 1713. A dedication from the librettist, Rossi, to the French ambassador, the Duc d'Aumont, appears with that date in a printed copy of the libretto. There may have been a private performance at the , London. However according to the Amadeus Almanac, the performance took place at Burlington House. The opera has been performed in modern times, for instance at the London Handel Festival in 2000 and at the Handel Festival, Halle in 2015.\n\n\nThe military leader Silla returns victorious to Rome, having subdued both rebellious foreign populations and his own personal enemy, Mario (the historical Gaius Marius) and his army. Silla passes through a specially constructed triumphal arch as trumpets sound and the populace acclaim him. When Silla announces that he is proclaiming himself dictator and sole law-giver for Rome, however, both his wife Metella and the tribune Lepido are appalled.\n\nFlavia, Lepido's wife, tells him of bad dreams she has been having about dangers to Rome but Lepido dismisses this as superstition.\n\nCelia, daughter of a high-ranking statesman who also opposed Silla's enemy Mario, is in love with the senator Claudio and he with her but she cannot bring herself to accept him as he is a supporter of Mario.\n\nClaudio confronts Silla and accuses him of destroying Roman liberty. Silla is furious and refuses to hear it, but, left alone, Claudio vows to continue to struggle against tyranny.\n\nSilla is discovered by his wife Metella attempting to seduce the lovely Celia. Metella puts a stop to this, for the moment.\n\nSilla next attempts the virtue of Lepido's wife Flavia, at her home. Lepido discovers him and intervenes, whereupon Silla accuses Lepido of conspiring with others to overthrow him and orders both Lepido and his wife to be imprisoned, awaiting execution. Husband and wife tearfully bid farewell.\n\nCelia has overcome her scruples about accepting a supporter of her father's enemy, Mario, and has admitted she loves Claudio. The couple are basking in their happiness when Claudio is placed under arrest for conspiring against Silla and also sentenced to death. Metella learns of her husband's cruel and tyrannical orders from her servant Scabro and vows to prevent them from being carried out.\n\nIn the tower where he is imprisoned, Claudio can see the arena where he has been condemned to be torn apart by wild beasts and says farewell to life.\n\nMetella takes a garment she has soaked with animal blood and tells her servant Scabro to take it to Silla and tell him it is Lepido's, shed when he was executed. Silla is pleased but still wants to see Claudio torn by beasts. News is brought to Silla that the supporters of Mario are staging a new rebellion and Silla rushes off to quell it. Metella orders both Claudio and Lepido released from prison.\n\nLepido thanks Metella for rescuing him and announces his attention of assassinating Silla in order to restore Roman freedom. Metella refuses to have anything to do with such a plot against her husband. They receive word that Silla is leaving Rome. While Metella regrets that she has not been able to say good-bye to him, she seizes the opportunity to tell her servant Scabro to take Lepido to his wife Flavia in her prison cell and help her to escape.\n\nSilla regrets the necessity of leaving Rome without satisfying his desires towards either Celia or Flavia. He attempts to seduce Celia again, but she repulses him and he informs her that her beloved Claudio has been torn alive by wild beasts and leaves her. Celia laments her lover's death and hears an echo of her words - it is Claudio himself, who has been listening. At first she thinks it must be a ghost, but she is then overjoyed to be re-united with the living Claudio.\n\nMore or less the same scenario then occurs in Flavia's prison cell where she awaits death. Silla appears with the bloodstained garment, telling her it is what her husband was wearing when he was shot by arrows, and threatens her with the same fate unless she will yield herself to his lust. She refuses, whereupon Silla storms out. Lepido appears to his wife and at first she too believes she is seeing a ghost, but he reassures her and they express their delight.\n\nAt the port where Silla is embarking to leave Rome, his wife Metella appears to bid him farewell. He expresses his regret at his treatment of her and the couple hope one day they will again be able to be together. Metella watches from the shore as the ship Silla is on flounders in a storm and sinks. Silla escapes the wreck and swims to a nearby island, Metella gets into a little boat, rows out to him and rescues her husband.\n\nLepido and Claudio are at the Capitol rallying their supporters for a revolt against Silla's monstrous tyranny when the god Mars appears on a cloud and announces Rome's salvation. Metalla leads in her repentant husband, who extends apologies to all for his behaviour and announces his retirement to a small estate where he will live quietly with his wife. Claudio and Celia will now marry. All rejoice in the fortunate outcome of events.\n\nThe German-born Handel, after spending some of his early career composing operas and other pieces in Italy, settled in London, where in 1711 he had brought Italian opera for the first time with his opera \"Rinaldo\". A tremendous success, \"Rinaldo\" created a craze in London for Italian opera seria, a form focused overwhelmingly on solo arias for the star virtuoso singers. \"Rinaldo\", a \"magic\" opera featuring enchantments, sorceresses and scenic ingenuity, was followed by \"Il Pastor Fido\", a shorter and simpler opera, which was not a success with London audiences at its first performances. The occasion for which \"Silla\" was written is not known and the presence of a part for a non-singing actor (Scabro) in a Handel opera is a unique feature of \"Silla\" for which the reason is again unknown.\nThe work is scored for strings,two recorders, two oboes, bassoon, trumpet, and continuo instruments.\n\nHandel: \"Silla\" – London Handel Orchestra\n\nHandel: \"Silla\" – Europa Galante\n\nSources\n\n"}

Musical entertainments are provided by Dame Edna May Oliver as \"The Lady in Red\", the Dionne quintuplets (who were in reality only two years old at the time) and Helen Morgan, sitting on the piano, turning on the tears with a torch song causing most of the guests to cry (except Ben Birdie and a few of the guests) and flooding the Grove in the process. Whereas other cartoons have cariacatured celebrities as either humans or animals, oddly, this short does both - half are seen as human, half as animal versions of the stars.\n\n"}

The diplomat prompted a mid-air terrorism alert after smoking in the aircraft lavatory, which led the Qatari government to recall him two days later.\nUnited no longer uses Flight 663 as a DCA-DEN-LAS route. UA663 is now used on the Houston-Edmonton route, flown by an Airbus A320.\n\nFlight 663 was a flight between Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, DC and Denver International Airport, continuing on to Las Vegas International Airport using a different aircraft than the one that operated the Washington–Denver sector. On 7 April 2010, a disturbance involving a passenger happened \"en route\" from Washington, DC to Denver. Officials identified the passenger as Mohammed al-Madadi, a diplomat from the Embassy of Qatar in Washington, D.C. Officials took al-Madadi into custody, and the plane landed safely in Denver. The North American Aerospace Defense Command scrambled two F-16 fighters to intercept and escort the aircraft into Denver. Officials said the incident was a misunderstanding after al-Madadi attempted to smoke a pipe in the lavatory, then made \"an unfortunate remark\" after being confronted by two members of the Federal Air Marshal Service. Law enforcement officials said al-Madadi mentioned \"lighting his shoes\", taken as a reference to shoe bomber Richard Reid.\n\nQatari Ambassador to the United States Ali Bin Fahad Al-Hajri issued a statement on the Embassy website:\n\nPress reports today regarding an incident aboard a commercial flight from Washington, DC to Denver, CO indicate that a Qatari diplomat was detained for suspicious behavior. We respect the necessity of special security precautions involving air travel, but this diplomat was traveling to Denver on official Embassy business on my instructions, and he was certainly not engaged in any threatening activity. The facts will reveal that this was a mistake, and we urge all concerned parties to avoid reckless judgments or speculation.\n\nThe Associated Press reported that al-Madadi was traveling on official Embassy business to visit Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a jailed al-Qaeda conspirator held at United States Penitentiary, Florence. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano praised the air marshals, who had been deployed in greater numbers following the attempted in-air bombing by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab on December 25, 2009.\n\nFelony charges would be applicable for non-diplomats. U.S. officials said al-Madadi would not face criminal charges because of diplomatic immunity. The suspect was released following interviews with law enforcement officials. United States Department of State officials said al-Madadi was removed from the country by Qatar, rather than being declared \"persona non grata\" by the U.S. government and expelled from the United States. Al-Madadi left the United States on April 9, 2010. Qatar's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ahmed bin Abdullah Al Mahmood said that al-Madadi would be disciplined.\n\nThe incident sparked international debate about how a matter of this nature should be handled. In the United States, some analysts objected that Qatar would not be asked to reimburse taxpayers, inconvenienced passengers, and the airline for costs of the incident. Though smoking was banned aboard U.S. commercial airliners in 1990, the cases brought by the Federal Aviation Administration rarely lead to more than a fine. Because of this, the \"Washington Post\" reported that some diplomats felt that the incident was a case of racial profiling of Arabs and Muslims. A \"Wall Street Journal\" editorial asserted that new profiling techniques based on behavior enjoy \"widespread public support.\" A Scripps News editorial agreed, stating \"the success so far of preventing a reprise of 9/11 may just depend on the highest-level reaction and then sorting it all out later.\" One passenger, author Michael Lind, argued in the \"Financial Times\" that \"there should have been a debate about overreaction to false alarms. I am as angry as anyone at the Qatari diplomat who escaped prosecution thanks to diplomatic immunity. But the incident was the result of the toxic interaction between his arrogance and foolishness and an airline security system that is irrational as a whole.\"\n\nIn Qatar, the incident provoked criticism of the foreign ministry. An editorial by Ahmad Al Sulaiti in the daily \"Al-Watan\" called the event \"embarrassing,\" adding, \"While I do not intend to give lessons to the foreign ministry, I wish [Minister] Al Mahmood would tell me if our diplomats are properly groomed before they are sent to our embassies abroad and whether they acquire skills from our veteran ambassadors.\" Al Mahmood replied that the incident was \"an individual misjudgment that should not be over-generalised.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "374909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=374909", "title": "United States Bicentennial", "text": "United States Bicentennial\n\nThe United States Bicentennial was a series of celebrations and observances during the mid-1970s that paid tribute to historical events leading up to the creation of the United States of America as an independent republic. It was a central event in the memory of the American Revolution. The Bicentennial culminated on Sunday, July 4, 1976, with the 200th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence.\n\nThe nation had always commemorated the Founding, as a gesture of patriotism and sometimes as an argument in political battles. Historian Jonathan Crider points out that in the 1850s, editors and orators both North and South claimed their region was the true custodian of the legacy of 1776, as they used the Revolution symbolically in their rhetoric.\n\nThe plans for the Bicentennial began when Congress created the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission on July 4, 1966. Initially, the Bicentennial celebration was planned as a single city exposition (titled Expo '76) that would be staged in either Philadelphia or Boston. After 6½ years of tumultuous debate, the Commission recommended that there should not be a single event, and Congress dissolved it on December 11, 1973, and created the American Revolution Bicentennial Administration (ARBA), which was charged with encouraging and coordinating locally sponsored events. David Ryan, a professor at University College Cork, notes that the Bicentennial was celebrated only a year after the humiliating withdrawal from Vietnam in 1975 and that the Ford administration stressed the themes of renewal and rebirth based on a restoration of traditional values, giving a nostalgic and exclusive reading of the American past.\n\nOn December 31, 1975, the eve of the Bicentennial Year, President Gerald Ford recorded a statement to address the American people by means of radio and television broadcasts. Presidential Proclamation 4411 was signed as an affirmation to the Founding Fathers of the United States principles of dignity, equality, government by representation, and liberty.\n\nBruce N. Blackburn, co-designer of the modernized NASA insignia, designed the logo. The logo consisted of a white five-point star inside a stylized star of red, white and blue. It was encircled by the inscription \"American Revolution Bicentennial 1776–1976\" in Helvetica Regular. An early use of the logo was on a 1971 U.S. postage stamp. The logo became a flag that flew at many government facilities throughout the United States and appeared on many other souvenirs and postage stamps issued by the Postal Service. NASA painted the logo on the Vehicle Assembly Building at the Kennedy Space Center in 1976 where it remained until 1998 when the agency replaced it with its own emblem as part of 40th anniversary celebrations.\n\nThe official Bicentennial events began April 1, 1975, when the American Freedom Train launched in Wilmington, Delaware to start its 21-month, tour of the 48 contiguous states. On April 18, 1975, President Gerald Ford traveled to Boston to light a third lantern at the historic Old North Church, symbolizing America's third century.\n\nThe next day, Ford delivered a major address commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in Massachusetts, which began the military aspect of the American Revolution against British colonial rule.\nFestivities included elaborate fireworks in the skies above major American cities. President Ford presided over the display in Washington, D.C. which was televised nationally. A large international fleet of tall-masted sailing ships gathered first in New York City on Independence Day and then in Boston about one week later. These nautical parades were named Operation Sail (Op Sail) and witnessed by several million observers. The gathering was the second of six such Op Sail events to date (1964, 1976, 1986, 1992, 2000, and 2012). The vessels docked and allowed the general public to tour the ships in both cities, while their crews were entertained on shore at various ethnic celebrations and parties.\n\nIn addition to the presence of the 'tall ships', navies of many nations sent warships to New York harbor for an International Naval Review held the morning of July 4. President Ford sailed down the Hudson River into New York harbor aboard the guided missile cruiser to review the international fleet and receive salutes from each visiting ship, ending with a salute from the British guided missile destroyer . The review ended just above Liberty Island around 10:30 am.\n\nSeveral people threw packages labeled \"Gulf Oil\" and \"Exxon\" into Boston Harbor in symbolic opposition to corporate power, in the style of the Boston Tea party.\n\nJohnny Cash was the Grand Marshall of the U.S. Bicentennial parade.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip made a state visit to the United States to tour the country and attend Bicentennial festivities with President and Mrs. Ford. Their visit aboard the Royal Yacht \"Britannia\" included stops in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Virginia, New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.\n\nWhile in Philadelphia on July 6, 1976, Queen Elizabeth presented the Bicentennial Bell on behalf of the British people. The bell is a replica of the Liberty Bell, cast at the same foundry—Whitechapel Bell Foundry—and bearing the inscription \"For the People of the United States of America from the People of Britain 4 July 1976 LET FREEDOM RING.\"\n\nLocal observances included painting mailboxes and fire hydrants red, white, and blue. A wave of patriotism and nostalgia swept the nation and there was a general feeling that the irate era of the Civil Rights Movement, the Vietnam War and the Watergate constitutional crisis of 1974 had finally come to an end.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., the Smithsonian Institution opened a long-term exhibition in its Arts and Industries Building that replicated the look and feel of the 1876 Centennial Exposition. Many of the Smithsonian's museum artifacts dated from the 1876 World's Fair in Philadelphia that commemorated the 100th anniversary of the independence of the United States. The Smithsonian also opened the new home of the National Air and Space Museum July 1, 1976.\n\nNASA commemorated the Bicentennial by staging a science and technology exhibit housed in a series of geodesic domes in the parking lot of the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) called \"Third Century America\". An American flag and the Bicentennial emblem were also painted on the side of the VAB; the emblem remained until 1998, when it was painted over with the NASA insignia. NASA originally planned for Viking 1 to land on Mars on July 4, but the landing was delayed to July 20, the anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing. On the anniversary of the signing of the Constitution, NASA held the rollout ceremony of the first space shuttle (which NASA had planned to name \"Constitution\" but was, instead, named \"Enterprise\" in honor of its fictional namesake on the television series \"\" ).\nMany commercial products appeared in red, white, and blue packages in an attempt to tie them to the Bicentennial. Liberty, a brand of Spanish olives, sold their product in glass jars replicating the Liberty Bell during that time. Products were only permitted to display the trademarked Bicentennial logo by paying a license fee to ARBA.\n\nMany national railroads and shortlines painted locomotives or rolling stock in patriotic color schemes, typically numbered 1776 or 1976, and many military units marked aircraft with special designs in honor of the Bicentennial.\n\nDisneyland and The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World presented \"America on Parade\", an elaborate parade celebrating American history and culture, and featured the Sherman Brothers' song \"The Glorious Fourth\". The parade featured nightly fireworks and ran twice daily from June 1975 to September 1976.\n\nJohn Warner, later U.S. Senator from Virginia, served as ARBA director.\n\nThe New Jersey Lottery operated a special \"Bicentennial Lottery\" in which the winner received $1,776 per week (before taxes) for 20 years (a total of $1,847,040).\n\nThe overall theme of the entertainment of Super Bowl X, held January 18, was to celebrate the Bicentennial. Players on both teams, the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Dallas Cowboys, wore a special patch with the Bicentennial Logo on their jerseys; the Cowboys also added red, white and blue striping to their helmets throughout their bicentennial season. The halftime show, featuring the performance group Up with People, was entitled \"200 Years and Just a Baby: A Tribute to America's Bicentennial\".\n\nThe United States Olympic Committee initiated bids to host both the 1976 Summer and Winter Olympic Games in celebration of the Bicentennial. Los Angeles bid for the 1976 Olympics but lost to Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Denver was awarded the 1976 Olympic Winter Games in 1970, but concern over costs led Colorado voters to reject a referendum to fund the games and the International Olympic Committee awarded the games to Innsbruck, Austria, the 1964 host. As a result, there was no Olympics in the United States in 1976 despite a last minute offer from Salt Lake City to host. However, Lake Placid would host the 1980 Winter Olympics, Los Angeles would eventually be awarded the 1984 summer games, and Salt Lake City would also eventually be awarded the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\nAs site of the Continental Congress and signing of the Declaration of Independence, Philadelphia served as host for the 1976 NBA All-Star Game, the 1976 National Hockey League All-Star Game, the 1976 NCAA Final Four, and the 1976 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at which President Ford threw out the first pitch. The 1976 Pro Bowl was an exception and was played in New Orleans, likely due to weather concerns.\n\nGeorge Washington was posthumously appointed to the grade of General of the Armies of the United States by the congressional joint resolution passed January 19, 1976, with an effective appointment date of July 4, 1976. This restored Washington's position as the highest-ranking military officer in U.S. history.\n\nThe Bicentennial Wagon Train Pilgrimage began a journey from Blaine, Washington on June 8, 1975 concluding at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania on July 4, 1976. The wagon train pilgrimage traced the original covered wagon trade and transportation routes across the United States encompassing the Bozeman Trail, California Trail, Gila Trail, Great Wagon Road, Mormon Trail, Natchez Trace Trail, Old Post Road, Old Spanish Trail, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail, and Wilderness Road.\n\nKaren Steele was the first baby born on July 4, 1976, 12 seconds after midnight, and was referred to as the \"Bicentennial Baby.\" She was featured on \"The Today Show\" and \"Good Morning America\", and received commemorations from President Ford, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne, and a host of other notables.\n\nRelated network television programs aired July 3–4, 1976\n\nThe Bicentennial Minutes were short vignettes aired on CBS from 1974 through the end of 1976 to mark the occasion.\n\nSaturday morning Bicentennial programs<br>\nIn the months approaching the Bicentennial, \"Schoolhouse Rock!\", a series of educational cartoon shorts running on ABC between programs on Saturday mornings, created a sub-series called \"History Rock,\" although the official name was \"America Rock.\" The ten segments covered various aspects of American history and government. Several of the segments, most notably \"I'm Just a Bill\" (discussing the legislative process) and \"The Preamble\" (which features a variant of the preamble of the Constitution put to music), have become some of \"Schoolhouse Rock\"'s most popular segments.\n\nIn 1975, CBS aired a new animated Archie series on Saturday mornings called \"The U.S. of Archie\"; unfortunately the program was unsuccessful, and was off the air by September 1976.\n\nFor the Bicentennial celebration, Hollywood filmmaker John Huston directed a short movie—\"Independence\" (1976)—for the U.S. National Park Service which continues to screen at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia to the present day (2018).\n\nThe movie \"Rocky\" cited the Bicentennial in several scenes, mostly during Apollo Creed's entering; Carl Weathers dressed first as George Washington then as Uncle Sam.\n\nA number of nations gave gifts to the US as a token of friendship. Among them were:\n\nCanada through the National Film Board of Canada produced the book \"Between Friends/Entre Amis\" which was a photographic essay of life along the US-Canada border. The book was given to libraries across the US and special editions were presented to President Gerald Ford and other officials.\n\nThe government of France and Musée du Louvre assembled an exhibit of paintings in cooperation with the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Metropolitan Museum of Art that traveled to Detroit and New York City after being shown in Paris. The exhibit, entitled \"French Painting 1774–1830: The Age of Revolution\", included the work of 94 French artists from that period. Many of the 149 works in the exhibit had never been seen outside France and included \"Liberty Leading the People\" by Eugène Delacroix, \"Jupiter and Thetis\" by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres and a portrait of Maximilien Robespierre by Adélaïde Labille-Guiard.\n\nJapan's government constructed and furnished the 513-seat Terrace Theatre of Kennedy Center in Washington. Fifty-three bonsai trees from the Nippon Bonsai Association were donated to the U. S. National Arboretum.\n\nKing Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofía of Spain presented sculptures of \"Bernardo de Gálvez\", a hero of the American Revolutionary War period and later Viceroy of New Spain; and \"Don Quixote\", Cervantes' fictional hero, on June 3, 1976, on behalf of their nation.\n\nThe United Kingdom loaned one of the four existing copies of the Magna Carta for display in the US Capitol. The document was displayed in a case designed by artist Louis Osman consisting of gold, stainless steel, rubies, pearls, saphires, diamonds and white enamel. This was on a base of pegmatite and Yorkshire sandstone. The document was displayed atop a gold replica from June 3, 1976 until June 13, 1977, when it was returned. The case and gold replica remain on display in the Capitol.\n\nKing of Norway Olav V, Prime Minister of Norway Odvar Nordli, and Norwegian Government established the Vinland National Health Sports Center in Loretto, Minnesota.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21347614", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21347614", "title": "Vinalia", "text": "Vinalia\n\nThe Vinalia were Roman festivals of the wine harvest, wine vintage and gardens, held in honour of Jupiter and Venus. The \"Vinalia prima\" (\"first Vinalia\"), also known as the \"Vinalia urbana\" (\"Urban Vinalia\") was held on 23 April to bless and sample last year's wine and ask for good weather until the next harvest. The \"Vinalia rustica\" (\"Rustic Vinalia\") was on 19 August, before the harvest and grape-pressing.\n\nThe \"Vinalia Urbana\" was held on 23 April. It was predominantly a wine festival, shared by Venus as patron of \"profane\" wine (\"vinum spurcum\") intended for everyday human use, and Jupiter as patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine (\"temetum\"). In honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with ordinary wine, men and women alike sampled the \"vinum spurcum\" of the previous autumn's pressing. As god of the weather on which the wine-harvest depended, Jupiter was offered a special libation of the previous year's sacred wine vintage, blessed by his high priest and poured into a ditch outside Venus' Capitoline temple, probably under the gaze of Rome's higher echelons. Common girls (\"vulgares puellae\") and prostitutes (\"meretrices\") gathered at Venus Erycina's Colline temple – probably on separate occasions, for propriety's sake – to offer the goddess myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches. In return, they asked her for \"beauty and popular favour\", and to be made \"charming and witty\".\n\nThe \"Vinalia Rustica\" was held on 19 August. It was originally a rustic Latin harvest festival, celebrating the grape harvest, vegetable growth and fertility. At the Roman \"Vinalia Rustica\", kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to \"Venus Obsequens\", the oldest known form of Venus. In Roman mythology, it marked the fulfillment of a vow by the ancient Latin allies of Rome's legendary ancestor Aeneas, who promised all wine of the next sacred vintage to Jupiter, in return for victory against the Etruscan tyrant Mezentius. According to some sources, the warlike Mezentius had claimed this vintage as his due, not Jupiter's. Roman opinions differ on which deity presided at the \"Vinalia Rustica\"; Varro insists that like the \"Vinalia Urbana\", it was sacred to Jupiter, who controlled the weather that governed the growing and ripening of grapes; moreover Jupiter's priest picked the first bunch of grapes, blessed the first sacred pressing and offered a sacrifice; these observations are borne out by Pliny the Elder. In practice, however, the festival had strong popular and cult connections to Venus as patron goddess of ordinary, religiously \"impure\" wine (\"vinum spurcum\"). Some of the rites took place at her various temples. The sacrificial victim offered by Jupiter's priest, a female lamb (\"agna\") may be evidence if not of Venus herself, then of an ancient, rustic Latin goddess very much like her. An account of the origins and rise of this festival is given by Festus.\n\n"}

Following the 2017 season, an agreement was reached for the World Touring Car Championship to become WTCR and use the TCR technical regulations. With titles for drivers and teams only, the WTCR series will receive 'World Cup' rather than 'World Championship' status when it runs for the first time in 2018.\n\nIn 1993, with the high popularity of the Supertouring category, the FIA hosted the FIA World Touring Car Cup — an annual event for touring car drivers hailing from national championships all over the world.
