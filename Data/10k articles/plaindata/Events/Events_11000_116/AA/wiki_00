The cause was ascribed to loss of flight control due to explosive decompression and structural failure. The accident marked the second operational loss and first fatal crash for the C-5 Galaxy fleet, and is the deadliest accident involving a U.S. military aircraft.\n\nEarly in April 1975, with much of South Vietnam overrun by North Vietnamese forces, the administration of US President Gerald Ford began instituting the evacuation of American citizens. To avoid alarming the host country, U.S. Ambassador to South Vietnam Graham Martin authorized Americans to be flown out under several conditions, one of which was Operation Babylift, in which American caregivers were paired with South Vietnamese orphans.\n\nOn the afternoon of Friday, 4 April 1975, C-5A, AF Ser. No. 68-0218, making the first flight of Operation Babylift, departed Tan Son Nhut Air Base for Clark Air Base in the Philippines. This first group of orphans would then transfer to charter flights and be welcomed by President Ford upon arriving in the United States at San Diego, California. At 4:15 p.m. the C-5A was over the South China Sea about off Vũng Tàu, South Vietnam, flying a heading of 136 degrees and climbing to an altitude of . At that moment the locks on the rear loading ramp failed, causing the cargo door to open explosively. This caused explosive decompression, temporarily filling the cabin with a whirlwind of fog and debris. The blowout severed control cables to the tail, causing two of four hydraulic systems to fail, including those for the rudder and elevator, and leaving the flight control with only the use of one aileron, spoilers, and power.\n\nThe pilot, Captain Dennis \"Bud\" Traynor, and copilot, Captain Tilford Harp, attempted to regain control of the airplane, and to perform a 180 degree turn in order to return to Tan Son Nhut. The aircraft began to exhibit phugoid oscillations, but the crew countered them and maintained a controlled descent of about . They were able to bring the plane to and begin the approach to Tan Son Nhut's runway 25L. While turning on final approach, the plane's descent rate suddenly began to increase rapidly. The crew increased power to the engines in an attempt to arrest the descent, but despite their efforts, the plane touched down at 4:45 p.m. in a rice paddy, and skidded for a quarter of a mile (400 m), became airborne again for another half-mile (800 m), crossing the Saigon River, then hit a dike and broke up into four pieces. The fuel caught fire and some of the wreckage was set ablaze.\n\nSurvivors struggled to extricate themselves from the wreckage. The crash site was in a muddy rice paddy near the Saigon River, one mile (1.6 km) from the nearest road. Fire engines could not reach the site, and helicopters had to set down some distance from the wreckage. About 100 South Vietnamese soldiers deployed around the site, which was near the site of an engagement with the Viet Cong the previous night. Out of 328 people on board, the death toll included 78 children, 35 Defence Attaché Office employees and 11 U.S. Air Force personnel; there were 173 survivors. All of the surviving orphans were eventually flown to the United States. The dead orphans were cremated and were interred at the cemetery of the St. Nikolaus Catholic Church in Pattaya, Thailand. The accident would also \"stand as the single largest loss of life\" in the Defense Intelligence Agency's history until the September 11 attacks because among the crash fatalities were five female DIA employees.\n\nSome members of the United States Congress called for a grounding of C-5s. In the end, the fleet was put under severe operational restrictions for several months while the cause was established. The U.S. Air Force Accident Investigation Board attributed the survival of any on board to Captain Traynors unorthodox use of power and his decision to crash-land while the aircraft allowed some control. Captains Traynor and Harp, who both survived, were awarded the Air Force Cross for extraordinary valor. Thirty-seven medals were awarded to crew members or their next of kin. USAF Flight Nurse, 1st Lieutenant Regina Aune, received the Cheney Award for 1975.\n\nGiven the explosive manner in which the rear doors failed, sabotage was initially suspected.\n\nMany of the components were looted from the crash site, thereby complicating the investigation; the U.S. Air Force paid a bounty for parts from the wreckage to recover them from the local populace. The United States Navy amphibious cargo ship , frigate , and command ship were assigned to search for the flight data recorder in the South China Sea. The recorder was found, and U.S. Navy ships and helicopters also discovered wreckage from the doors in the South China Sea as well as the body of a C-5 crewmember.\n\nWhen the rear doors were eventually recovered from the sea, investigation determined that some of the locks had not engaged properly. Maintenance records showed that locks had been cannibalized for spares, then subsequently improperly refitted so that not all the door locks were engaging correctly. Accounts also indicated the initial maintenance inspection noticed 5 of the 7 locks were not operating and failed the aircraft for flight. With external organizational pressure to get the flight airborne, a second off-shift maintenance team was called in. They subsequently missed the locks during inspection and the aircraft was cleared for flight. Furthermore, the flight crew confirmed that they had encountered difficulty closing the doors before take-off. As the air pressure differential increased with altitude, the few locks that were working correctly were unable to bear the load, and the door failed.\n\nThe story of the disaster was featured on the seventh season of the Canadian made, internationally distributed documentary series \"Mayday\", in the episode \"Operation Babylift\".\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1585862", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1585862", "title": "Acute stress reaction", "text": "Acute stress reaction\n\nAcute stress reaction (also called acute stress disorder, psychological shock, mental shock, or simply shock) is a psychological condition arising in response to a terrifying or traumatic event, or witnessing a traumatic event that induces a strong emotional response within the individual. It should not be confused with the unrelated circulatory condition of shock/hypoperfusion. Acute stress reaction (ASR) may develop into delayed stress reaction (better known as Posttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD) if stress is not correctly managed. ASR is characterized by re-living and avoiding reminders of an aversive event, as well as generalized hypervigilance after initial exposure to a traumatic event. ASR is differentiated from PTSD as a disorder that precedes it, and if symptoms last for more than one month, it will develop into PTSD. It can thus be thought of as the acute phase of PTSD.\n\nThe \"DSM-IV\" specifies that ASD must be accompanied by the presence of dissociative symptoms, which largely differentiates it from PTSD.\n\nDissociative symptoms include a sense of numbing or detachment from emotional reactions, a sense of physical detachment, such as seeing oneself from another perspective, decreased awareness of one’s surroundings, the perception that one’s environment is unreal or dreamlike, and the inability to recall critical aspects of the traumatic event (dissociative amnesia).\n\nIn addition to the characteristic dissociative symptoms, Acute Stress Disorder from the DSM-5 can present from four other distinct symptom clusters such as:\n\n\nThere are several theoretical perspectives on trauma response, including cognitive, biological, and psychobiological. While the theories are PTSD-specific, they are still useful in understanding ASD, as both share many symptoms.\n\nAcute stress disorder (abbreviated ASD, and not to be confused with autism spectrum disorder) is the result of a traumatic event in which the person experiences or witnesses an event that causes the victim/witness to experience extreme, disturbing, or unexpected fear, stress, or pain, and that involves or threatens serious injury, perceived serious injury, or death to themselves or someone else. A study of rescue personnel after exposure to a traumatic event showed no gender difference in acute stress reaction. Acute stress reaction is a variation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\n\nA recent study found that a \"single\" stressful event may cause long-term consequences in the brain. This result calls the traditional distinction between the effects of acute vs chronic stress into question.\n\nStress is characterized by specific physiological responses to aversive or noxious stimuli.\n\nHans Selye was the first to coin the term “general adaptation syndrome”, to suggest that stress induced physiological responses proceed through the stages of alarm, resistance, and exhaustion.\n\nThe sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system gives rise to a specific set of physiological responses in response to physical or psychological stress. The body’s response to stress is also termed “fight-or-flight response”, and it is characterized by an increase in blood flow to skeletal muscles, the heart and brain, a rise in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as dilation of pupils, and an increase in the amount of glucose released by the liver.\n\nThe onset of an acute stress response is associated with specific physiological actions in the sympathetic nervous system, both directly and indirectly through the release of adrenaline and to a lesser extent noradrenaline from the medulla of the adrenal glands. These catecholamine hormones facilitate immediate physical reactions by triggering increases in heart rate and breathing, constricting blood vessels. An abundance of catecholamines at neuroreceptor sites facilitates reliance on spontaneous or intuitive behaviors often related to combat or escape.\n\nNormally, when a person is in a serene, unstimulated state, the \"firing\" of neurons in the locus ceruleus is minimal. A novel stimulus, once perceived, is relayed from the sensory cortex of the brain through the thalamus to the brain stem. That route of signaling increases the rate of noradrenergic activity in the locus ceruleus, and the person becomes alert and attentive to the environment.\n\nIf a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (Thase & Howland, 1995). The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of norepinephrine from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. The other major player in the acute stress response is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Stress activates this axis and produces neurobiological changes. These chemical changes increase the chances of survival by bringing the physiological system back to homeostasis. \n\nThe autonomic nervous system controls all automatic functions in the body and contains two subsections within it that aids in response to an acute stress reaction. These two subunits are the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic response is colloquially known as the \"fight or flight\" response, indicated by accelerated pulse and respiration rates, pupil dilation, and a general feeling of anxiety and hyper-awareness. This is caused by the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal glands. The epinephrine and norepinephrine strike the beta receptors of the heart, which feeds the heart sympathetic nerve fibers in order to increase the strength of heart muscle contraction; as a result more blood gets circulated, increasing the heart rate and respiratory rate. The sympathetic nervous system also stimulates the skeletal system and muscular system in an effort to pump more blood to those areas to handle the acute stress. Simultaneously the sympathetic nervous system inhibits the digestive system and the urinary system in order to optimize blood flow to the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. This plays a role in the alarm reaction stage. The para-sympathetic response is colloquially known as the \"rest and digest\" response, indicated by reduced heart and respiration rates, and more obviously by a temporary loss of consciousness if the system is fired at a rapid rate. The parasympathetic nervous system stimulates the digestive system and urinary system in order to send more blood to those systems to increase the process of digestion. In order to do this, it must inhibit the cardiovascular system and respiratory system in an effort to optimize blood flow to the digestive tract causing low heart and respiratory rates. Parasympathetic plays no role in acute stress response (VanPutte Regan Russo 2014).\n\nStudies have shown that patients with ASD have overactive right amygdalae and pre-frontal cortices, both structures that are involved in the fear-processing pathway.\n\nAccording to the DSM 5, symptom presentation must last for 3 days in order for a diagnosis of ASD to be made. If symptoms persist past 1 month, the diagnosis of PSTD is explored. \nThere must be a clear temporal connection between the impact of an exceptional stressor and the onset of symptoms; onset is usually within a few minutes or days but may occur up to one month after the stressor. In addition, the symptoms show a mixed and usually changing picture; in addition to the initial state of \"daze,\" depression, anxiety, anger, despair, overactivity, and withdrawal may all be seen, but no one type of symptom predominates for long; the symptoms usually resolve rapidly in those cases where removal from the stressful environment is possible; in cases where the stress continues or cannot by its nature be reversed, the symptoms usually begin to diminish after 24–48 hours and are usually minimal after about 3 days.\n\nThe \"DSM-5\" specifies there is a higher prevalence rate of ASD in females compared to males due to higher risk of experiencing traumatic events and neurobiological gender differences in stress response that increase the risk of ASD.\n\nThis disorder may resolve itself with time or may develop into a more severe disorder such as PTSD. However, results of Creamer, O'Donnell, and Pattison's (2004) study of 363 patients suggests that a diagnosis of acute stress disorder had only limited predictive validity for PTSD. Creamer et al. did find that re-experiences of the traumatic event and arousal were better predictors of PTSD. Early pharmacotherapy may prevent the development of posttraumtic symptoms. Additionally, early trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TFCBT) for those with a diagnosis of ASD can protect an individual from chronic PTSD.\n\nStudies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of counselling and psychotherapy for people with ASD. Cognitive behavioral therapy which included exposure and cognitive restructuring was found to be effective in preventing PTSD in patients diagnosed with ASD with clinically significant results at 6 months follow-up. A combination of relaxation, cognitive restructuring, imaginal exposure, and in vivo exposure was superior to supportive counseling. Mindfulness based stress reduction programs also appear to be effective for stress management.\n\nIn a wilderness context where counseling, psychotherapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy is unlikely to be available, the treatment for acute stress reaction is very similar for the treatment of cardiogenic shock, vascular shock, and hypovolemic shock; that is, allowing the patient to lie down, providing reassurance, and removing the stimulus for the occurrence of the reaction. In traditional shock cases, this is generally the relieving of pain from injuries or the stopping of blood loss. In an acute stress reaction, this may be pulling a rescuer away from the emergency to calm down, or blocking the sight of an injured friend from a patient.\nThe term ASR was first used to describe the symptoms of soldiers during World War I and II, and it was therefore also termed combat stress reaction (CSR). Approximately 20% of U.S. troops displayed symptoms of CSR during WWII, and it was assumed to be a temporary response of healthy individuals to witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Symptoms include depression, anxiety, withdrawal, confusion, paranoia and sympathetic hyperactivity.\n\nThe APA officially included the term ASD in the \"DSM-IV\" in 1994, and prior to that, symptomatic individuals within the first month of trauma were diagnosed with adjustment disorder. According to the \"DSM IV\", ASR refers to the symptoms experienced right after exposure to a traumatic event, up until 48 hours after it. In contrast, ASD is defined by symptoms experienced after 48 hours of the event, up until one month past the event. Symptoms experienced for longer than one month are consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD.\n"}

He is most well known for being the first doctor to test the smallpox vaccine in the United States, which he carried out on his own family.\n\nWaterhouse was born into a Quaker family, although he never adopted the religion as his own. His parents were Timothy Waterhouse, a chair maker who also served on the Governor's Council, and Hannah Waterhouse. Born and raised in Rhode Island, his medical career began at age 16, when he apprenticed for a doctor in his hometown. At age 21, he left the United States to study medicine in Europe at several notable institutions, such as with Dr. John Fothergill in London, England. He was also educated in Edinburgh at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. He matriculated Oct. 28, 1778 at the Leiden University and received at the same University his medical degree Apr. 19, 1780. The title description of his thesis is: Dissertatio medica De sympathia partium corporis humani, ejusque, in explicandis et curandis morbis necessaria consideratione ... - Lugduni Batavorum : Th. Koet, 1780. - 38 p. ; 25 cm. His thesis is dedicated to John Fothergill, M.D., \"inspirer of my studies.\" \nWhile living in Holland, he roomed with future U.S. president John Adams.\n\nAfter returning to the United States in 1782, Waterhouse joined the faculty of the new medical school at Harvard as one of three professors, including John Warren and Aaron Dexter, in the area of Theory and Practice of Physic. He was also elected that same year as a Fellow at Rhode Island College (now \"Brown University\"). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1795. In 1814, Waterhouse resigned his Harvard professorship after opposing a plan to establish the Medical School in Boston and attempting to found a rival medical school.\n\nWaterhouse first wrote to then-President John Adams, his former roommate, hoping to spread the word about cowpox vaccinations preventing smallpox. When he found President Adams unresponsive, he wrote a letter to Vice President Thomas Jefferson entitled \"A prospect of exterminating the smallpox.\"\nJefferson replied with a letter dated Christmas Day, 1800, and soon offered his support. Once Jefferson became President the following year, Waterhouse introduced Edward Jenner's method of cowpox vaccination in the United States. He attempted to maintain a monopoly over the cowpox vaccine, for both financial reasons and to protect the vaccine from incompetent or fraudulent physicians. Waterhouse made the first vaccinations in the United States on four of his children. He commissioned a controlled experiment at the Boston Board of Health in which 19 vaccinated and 2 unvaccinated boys were exposed to the smallpox virus. The vaccinated boys demonstrated immunity and the 2 unvaccinated boys succumbed to the disease.\n\nIn 1788, he married Elizabeth Oliver, with whom he had six children. She died in childbirth in 1815. In 1819, he married Louisa Lee; no children resulted from this marriage.\n\nWaterhouse was a prickly character, with a tendency to become involved in controversy.\n\nWaterhouse had a commission in the U.S. Army during the War of 1812 in the days before military physicians were accorded rank. He held the position of \"Hospital Surgeon\", in 1818 he was promoted to \"Post Surgeon\", and in 1821 he was honorably discharged.\n\nThroughout the 1820s, Waterhouse was a strong supporter of Samuel Thomson's medical system. He died in his home in Cambridge in 1846, and was survived by his wife Louisa. He is interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery, where Louisa erected a small monument in his honor.\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on the life of the real-life French sculptor and graphic artist of the same name. The musical premiered at Goodspeed Musicals in 2003.\nThe show's opening scene is in 1913, when Camille was removed from society, then flashes back to 1881 and onward. The plot focuses on Claudel's career and her tempestuous relationship with Auguste Rodin, for whom she was a source of inspiration, a model, a confidante, and a lover. The show opens with Camille's love for her true passion - sculpting (\"In the Stone\"). The musical features Camille's sometimes troubling relationship with both her father (who had actually helped her) and brother, Paul Claudel. Despite not being a male, she insists she be allowed to be enrolled at Le Salon (\"Not a Man\"), yet she still manages to work and learn under Rodin. Act 1 concludes with Camille deciding she no longer needs Rodin, and attempts to live and create on her own, only to have Rodin tell her that she would be nothing without him (\"Taking Back My Life\"). \n\nAct II opens with Rodin reflecting on what he has done, and ailing with amiss for Camille (\"A Trembling Man\"). Camille now spends a lot of time with her father, and the two discuss older times and are at harmony (\"Snow Falls\"). When Paul realizes Camille's downward spiral into the unknown and her relations with Rodin, he attempts to save her and turn her to God, such as he had had his own conversion (\"Field of Angels\"). Instead, Camille cannot seem to understand why no one believes in her - including her family (\"What's Never Been Done Before\"). Rodin eventually rekindles his love with Camille, but the love is never returned (\"Learning How to Love You\"). After several more years, Camille's family decides that she is no longer stable (both emotionally & financially); they announce that her father has passed days earlier, and she is devastated that they did not tell her. Although she fights with Paul that she is not meant to be there, Paul and her mother send her to an insane asylum, where she comes to peace with the news of her father (\"Snow Falls (Reprise)\"). At the end of Act II, which switches to modern times, where Camille, now alone, reflects on the life she has lived (\"Gold\").\n\nThe world premiere was staged by Goodspeed Musicals in August through September 2003, in a \"developmental run\". Directed by Gabriel Barre and choreographed by Mark Dendy, the cast featured Linda Eder in the title role, Michael Nouri as Auguste Rodin, Matt Bogart as Paul Claudel and Milo O'Shea as Camille's father.\n\nThe musical was presented in a \"chamber-style\" form; the cast was minimum, and they attempted to do the most they could with small scale sets. Orchestrations (by Kim Scharnberg) were also on a smaller scale. Instead of bringing in statues, they used dancers to perform, and many of the scenes were strictly dancing for the statues (sometimes accompanied by music). \"The Waltz\" was one of these. There were also many book-scenes/moments, more than a common Wildhorn musical.

Although several changes have been made, many of the songs remain intact.\n\nNo cast recording have been released. In 2004, a studio demo recording was made, starring Linda Eder and the majority of the world premiere cast. While it was originally thought that the recording would be released (nearly all of Wildhorn's musicals have released a concept album prior to a major production), this did not happen.\n\nThe musical features the Linda Eder single \"Gold,\" which was included on two of her solo albums: \"Gold\" and \"Broadway, My Way\". The song was performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, and was covered by Brandi Burkhardt at several European concerts with Frank Wildhorn.\n\n"}

The children targeted by the knifeman are thought likely to be between six and eleven years of age. The attack occurred as the children were arriving for classes probably at 8:00 or maybe even 9:00.\n\nThe incident has followed other school attacks in China since 2010 by mentally disturbed perpetrators involved in personal disputes or unhappy with the rapid changes occurring in Chinese society. Security guards had been posted at schools across China, with all schools to have a security guard by 2013.\n\nDue to strict gun control laws in China, knives are usually the weapon of choice in violent crimes. The attack on the children occurred at the entrance of the school. Min first targeted the elderly woman, aged 85, who lived next to the school. He went to her house at around 7 a.m., stole one of her knives and attacked her head. The woman's daughter said an argument had occurred. At around 7:40 a.m., Min pursued the children with the knife he had stolen from the elderly woman's house and slashed them, many on their heads. \"Xinhua\" reported that some of the children had had fingers or ears cut off in the knife attack.\n\nMin was restrained at the primary school, and transferred to police custody. The victims were treated at three hospitals. Two of the children were taken to hospitals located outside Guangshan County to receive better care. None of the victims were fatally wounded.\n\nThe suspect was initially identified to be Min Yingjun (); however, later reports identified the perpetrator to be a different man, Min Yongjun (), of the same village as Min Yingjun. He is reported to have had a long history of epileptic seizures, and to have been influenced by the 2012 doomsday phenomenon. This has recently been propagated in China by the Oriental Lightning cult.\n\nThe Guangshan County government established an emergency response team for the incident. The coverage of the incident in local media was tightly controlled, with Beijing usually restricting coverage of such sensitive topics to dissuade copycat attacks, and an article in the \"Financial Times\" reported a backlash by Chinese citizens due to the lack of coverage of the school stabbings. An article in The Associated Press similarly wrote that a possible reason why authorities wanted to restrict the news was to either \"prevent encouraging others or to play down the crime to keep blame off the government.\"\n\nOfficials detained 52 people for spreading doomsday rumours, such as distributing leaflets.\n\nOn 16 December, the suspect was arrested and charged with the crime of endangering public safety by dangerous means.\n\nSix officials were fired. The reason for the dismissals have not been announced.\n\nSome commentaries situated the knife attacks in the wider context of China's social and economic transformation, noting the inadequacies in the country’s health care system for diagnosing and treating citizens suffering psychiatric distress and illnesses.\n\nAs the Chenpeng school attack was followed by the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in the United States hours later comparisons were drawn between the two. The difference in gun control laws between the two countries was used to explain the disparity in casualties of the school attacks by journalists and politicians, including U.S. Representative Jerry Nadler, and an article in the Associated Press noted that despite the different outcomes, an underlying commonality between the attacks was the increased frequency of school attacks because, \"attackers often seek out the vulnerable, hoping to amplify their outrage before they themselves often commit suicide.\"\n\nComparisons were also drawn between the incident handling by the local and national governments involved. The lack of coverage by Chinese state-run news channels, and the lack of any emotional response from the Chinese government at all levels were contrasted to the detailed US media coverage and US President Barack Obama's national speech, including his commitment to tackle the underlying issues.\n\nThe local police released footage from a security camera showing the attacker barging into the school and attacking a student. The video was noted and analysed by many news agencies, and contributed significantly to the widespread coverage of the incident.\n\n"}

The theme of this conference was equiveillance, the balance between surveillance and sousveillance. The equiveillance theme was reflected in the Opening Keynote Address, a panel discussion on equiveillance, and a pre-keynote sousveillance workshop, as well as a sousveillance performance. In keeping with this theme, every conference attendee received a sousveillance system consisting of a \"maybecamera\" attached to each conference bag. Some of the 500 conference bags contained cameras transmitting live 24/7 video whereas others contained no camera, but merely the familiar camera dome. A third category of conference bag included some with a subtle but visible flashing red light behind the dome. Not all of the wireless web cameras had flashing red lights, and some of the flashing red lights were dummy devices that did not transmit video. The bags that did transmit video also updated various video displays around the conference hall, visible to conference attendees.\n\nThe twenty-first annual CFP Conference in 2011, \"Computers, Freedom, and Privacy: The Future is Now\", was held at the Georgetown Law Center in Washington, DC June 14–16. Among the questions and issues explored were: What is social media’s role in the charged democracy movement in the Middle East and North Africa; How can technology and social media support human rights, What is the impact of mobile personal computing technology on freedom and privacy? Are the courts, policy and decision makers ready to address freedom and privacy in a 24-7 connected world? Are our leaders techs savvy enough to make good legal and policy decisions regarding the deployment of smart grid, e-health records, the spread of consumer location based advertising? Cybersecurity, cloud computing, net neutrality, federated ID, ubiquitous surveillance: Are they passing fads or here to stay? \n\n"}

McCollum is a New York City resident with a lengthy arrest record for crimes related to the transit system operated by the New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA). He has been fascinated with trains since his childhood, and has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.\n\nMcCollum has been interested in trains from an early age, frequently riding the New York Subway for days at a time. His fixation with trains has led McCollum to frequently impersonate MTA employees or a related entity, for which he has been jailed numerous times. McCollum has been rejected for employment by MTA on numerous occasions, although he is reported to know more about the trains, schedules, procedures and rail operations than any current employee.\n\nA prison psychiatrist who did an evaluation diagnosed him with Asperger syndrome. McCollum is said to have memorized the New York City Subway map by age 8.\n\nAccording to McCollum's mother, his interest with the New York City Subway system started in his youth, when subway motormen permitted him to drive trains. McCollum was first arrested in 1980, at age 15, when he drove an in-service New York City Subway E train for six stops. While he was in jail at Rikers Island, he wrote to the New York City Department of Correction and asked if he could drive one of their buses. By the mid-1990s, McCollum \"had become a minor cult figure\", particularly after the MTA posted thousands of wanted posters in trains and stations so that riders could report sightings. Occasionally, McCollum would appear as transit employees named \"Morning\" or \"Manning\", who riders invariably experienced as friendly and helpful.\n\nBy 2000, McCollum had been jailed 19 times for transit-related crimes. That year he pleaded guilty to charges of forgery and burglary for signing out a train according to proper MTA procedure to perform customary duties (extinguishing track fires, supervising maintenance), and then signing it back in. He was sentenced to a minimum of to 5 years in prison. In 2005, McCollum was apprehended at a Long Island Rail Road yard with the keys to an M-7 railcar in his pocket. They had been given to him by his MTA friends who had given him their shifts, but he pleaded guilty to attempting to steal a locomotive and was sentenced to three years in prison. Although he was released from Sing Sing in 2006, he was reimprisoned for breaking parole after he was found in possession of railroad property.\n\nOn June 13, 2008, McCollum, now 43, was arrested again. He was wearing a hardhat and carrying a knapsack, flashlight and gloves with an MTA logo. He was dressed in the blue T-shirt and work pants typically worn by track workers and was arrested as he tried to enter a restricted area of a midtown station. McCollum was charged with criminal impersonation, criminal trespass and possession of burglary tools—a hammer and screwdriver tucked in his backpack. These \"burglary tools\" are also the typical repair equipment that all MTA maintenance workers carry. When his mother was interviewed over the telephone, she said, \"Any time Darius wears anything remotely resembling the transit uniform, he gets arrested.\"\n\nMcCollum was released from the Downstate Correctional Facility on July 3, 2007—nine months after his arrest for violating parole by returning to the city from Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He was arrested at Penn Station on October 5, 2008, for impersonating a Long Island Rail Road employee and answering passengers' questions.\n\nOn August 31, 2010, McCollum was arrested for the 27th time and charged with grand larceny and possession of stolen property in connection with the theft of a private bus from a Trailways of New York terminal in Hoboken, New Jersey According to police, McCollum allegedly boarded the bus at approximately 6:30 a.m. that morning and discovered the keys left in the ignition. McCollum is accused of then commandeering the bus, with the theft reportedly going unnoticed for two hours as McCollum drove around John F. Kennedy International Airport and Jamaica, Queens. McCollum was taken into custody without incident. Police stated McCollum is \"very smart, he's not a dumb guy\" and that he was a \"gentleman\" during arrest and processing. At the time of his arrest, he had spent 18 years—more than a third of his life—in jail for transit-related offenses. In 2013, McCollum pleaded guilty to stealing the Trailways bus. On December 24 of that year, McCollum was released on parole and was to voluntarily enter cognitive behavioral therapy. The terms of the parole, which lasted until August 24, 2015, required that he does not operate a motor vehicle.\n\nOn November 11, 2015, McCollum was arrested for stealing a Greyhound bus from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. He drove the GPS-equipped bus for approximately 2 hours until his arrest at approximately 4 p.m. in Gowanus, Brooklyn. According to \"The New York Times\", McCollum said, “I’m stealing a plane next” after his arrest.\n\nAlthough his parents, who moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina, believe McCollum should leave New York to avoid the temptation of the trains, parole conditions have until recently repeatedly restricted McCollum to remain in New York City. Suggestions from his parents and autism advocates that the MTA find a way to hire McCollum in some capacity, in the manner of Frank Abagnale, are rejected by transit officials, who fear legal liability and anti-disability stigma. In January 2018, McCollum took a plea bargain in which he agreed to go to a psychiatric institution for an \"indefinite\" period of time.\n\nAfter McCollum used an insanity defense based on Asperger’s, he became a folk hero to people with autism spectrum disorder, especially children, celebrated for his “rebellion against what autistics often call the dreary world of the 'neurotypicals'”. In spite of his diagnosis from several psychiatrists, during at least two criminal proceedings, this defense was denied as the judge ruled he was “capable of controlling his impulses”.\n\nA \"Harper’s Magazine\" article on McCollum by Jeff Tietz was a finalist in profile writing for the 2003 American Society of Magazine Editors awards. At the 2003 Edinburgh Fringe, Paperhat Productions of New York mounted a play by Director Jude Domski called \"Boy Steals Train\", based on McCollum’s life and letters McCollum wrote to Domski, and described as “pointing a shaming collective finger at a judiciary that refuses to recognize Darius's condition”. The play was awarded a Fringe First by \"The Scotsman\" and the troupe won a Best Ensemble Acting Award. His story was also made into a BBC radio play, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in August 2005.\n\nMcCollum appears in Episode 2 of “The Dark End of The Spectrum,” a two-hour, two-part, radio documentary that aired on CBC’s radio show \"Ideas\" on June 2, 2008 and again on July 24 (Part 1) and July 31 (Part 2), 2009.\n\nA documentary film about McCollum, \"Off the Rails: The Darius McCollum Story\", directed by Adam Irving, premiered on April 7, 2016 at the Full Frame Documentary Film Festival in Durham, North Carolina.\n\n"}
{"id": "25262878", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25262878", "title": "Denis Avey", "text": "Denis Avey\n\nDenis Avey (11 January 1919 – 16 July 2015) was a British veteran of the Second World War who was held as a prisoner of war at Auschwitz. Whilst there, he saved the life of Jewish prisoner Ernst Lobethal, by smuggling cigarettes to him. For that he was made a British Hero of the Holocaust in 2010.\n\nHe also said that he exchanged uniforms with a Jewish prisoner and smuggled himself into Auschwitz to witness the treatment of Jewish inmates, whose camp was separate from but adjoined that of British POWs. His claim has been challenged. His memoir \"The Man who Broke into Auschwitz\", written with Rob Broomby, was published in 2011.\n\nAvey was born in Essex, outside London, in 1919. As a boy, he learned boxing, was head boy at school and studied at Leyton technical college. He joined the army in 1939 at the age of 20, and fought in the desert campaigns of North Africa in the 7th Armoured Division, known as the \"Desert Rats\". He was captured by the Germans while attacking Rommel's forces near Tobruk, Libya, and saw his best friend killed next to him. He claims to have escaped to Greece by crossing the Mediterranean Sea floating on top of a packing crate, but was recaptured after landing.\n\nAfter being retaken prisoner, he was placed in the E715 prison camp for British soldiers, next door to the Auschwitz concentration camp where Jews were imprisoned. He was there from 1943 until January 1945. While there he befriended a Jewish inmate of Auschwitz, Ernst Lobethal, from the adjoining Jewish section. He obtained cigarettes from Ernst's sister, who had escaped from Germany to Britain on a Kindertransport before the war. He secretly passed the cigarettes to Ernst who would use them as currency to help him survive.\n\nAvey also says that he twice exchanged uniforms with a Jewish inmate to smuggle himself into the inmate's camp in order to witness for himself the actual treatment of Jews, which he could see was completely different from the treatment of British POWs. While British POWs were forced to work six days a week, they could use their free time to play football and basketball. And while their conditions were dreadful, according to one British inmate, \"they were as nothing compared to what the Jews next door went through.\" Avey agreed, and describes the plight of the Jews:\n\nAvey explained to \"The Daily Telegraph\" during an interview that he was the type that needed to see things for himself:\n\nHe was aware that he was taking \"a hell of a chance,\" and states: \"When you think about it in today's environment it is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous. You wouldn't think anyone would think or do that, but that is how I was. I had red hair and a temperament to match. Nothing would stop me.\"\n\nAvey escaped during the \"death marches\" in April 1945 which followed the Nazis' evacuation of Auschwitz. Although suffering from tuberculosis caught in the camp, Avey broke away undetected, then made his way through Silesia, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. During the march Avey saw an estimated 15,000 dead prisoners, recalling that \"the road was littered with corpses.\" He eventually ran into Americans who helped get him back to England, and to his family who assumed he had died.\n\nAfter he returned to England, Avey spent the next year and a half hospitalized with tuberculosis. Afterwards, when he tried to report what he saw in Auschwitz, he encountered resistance and indifference. From then on, he chose to not to speak of it again to anyone:\n\nBritish author Sir Martin Gilbert explains that by 1947, after the war trials were finished, \"people just wanted to get on with their lives.\" Average citizens were not interested in discussing the war anymore, nor were they interested in hearing war stories from veterans or former POWs like Avey. \"It must have been very painful,\" says Gilbert.\n\nBesides tuberculosis, Avey suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) before it was recognized as a medical illness, an illness few people were aware of. For the following years he battled with nightmares, jumpiness, and an inability to speak about his POW experiences. He suffered from a violent temper, stomach pains, and loss of memory. From a beating during his incarceration, he also lost vision in one eye which became cancerous and required being replaced with a glass eye. The cause of the beating, Avey said, came when he cursed an SS officer who was beating a Jew in the camp. The officer took his pistol butt and gave Avey a blow directly on his eye.\n\nWhen war crime prosecutors later sought Avey's testimony for the Nuremberg Trials, they were unable to locate him. He kept the traumatic events about his wartime past a complete secret from everyone, including his first and second wives, along with his daughter. \"I knew there was something,\" said his wife, Audrey. \"Naturally, you ask questions. But I never got an answer.\" Avey explains: \"The sad irony was that I went in there to find out the truth, so I could tell everybody about the horrors of the Nazi regime. But I was so traumatised at my whole experience of the Auschwitz camps it took me 60 years to be able to recount the horrors I saw.\"\n\nHe first began disclosing these events when invited to appear on the BBC to talk about war pensions. His memories began tumbling out, shocking the television hosts who were unable to believe what they were hearing. As a result, the BBC began production of a documentary, discovering the name of the young Jewish prisoner Avey had befriended in Auschwitz, Ernst Lobethal.\" When asked why he risked his life to infiltrate the Jewish sections of the concentration camp, he states that he needed to see for himself \"the unspeakable things being done to the Jews at Auschwitz.\" At the age of 91, he reflects back on this episode:\n\nHe had assumed that Ernst had died during the death march, but did track down and meet Ernst's sister, Susanne, who also thought he died. She had escaped to England before war broke out in 1939.\n\nYears later, Susanne learned that her brother had actually survived, in part thanks to Avey, and had lived in America with his new family until his death. While he never got to meet Ernst, he said that his surviving was \"bloody marvellous.\" Ernst, like Avey, refused to burden anyone with his own suffering and never talked about Auschwitz until very late in life. But, says Avey, \"I, too, have left it late. I will always regret not tracking Ernst down while he was alive. If I’d known he was living in America, I would have gone and found him, without doubt. But I am proud to have played a small part in helping one man through the obscenity of Auschwitz.\"\n\nAvey married twice and pursued a career in engineering, which culminated in him building a factory near Newcastle. He retired to Bradwell, Derbyshire.\n\nAfter retirement he became active amongst ex-POWs seeking compensation for wartime imprisonment and began to talk about these experiences. In 2001 he described these in an interview with the Imperial War Museum in London, where he stated that he had obtained cigarettes for Ernst and also gave the name of Ernst's sister Susanne. He also stated that he had exchanged uniforms with a bunkmate of Ernst and entered Birkenau in the company of Ernst. Avey got details about events inside Birkenau which he sent home to his mother and sister in code. His mother sent two letters regarding this to the War Office but never received a reply. He was interviewed on BBC Radio Derby in 2003. In 2005 the \"Daily Mirror\" reported that Avey claimed to have swapped uniforms with Ernst and entered Birkenau where he witnessed prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.\n\nIn May 2009 the British Government announced the establishment of the British Hero of the Holocaust award. That autumn Rob Broomby, a reporter from the BBC, who had known of Avey's story for some years, was able to trace Ernst's sister in Birmingham. He learned that Ernst had in fact survived the death march and emigrated to the United States where he lived to the age of 77. Broomby also discovered that before his death, Ernst had recorded a video testimony of his experiences in Auschwitz, in which he mentions the British soldier whom he knew as \"Ginger\" who obtained cigarettes. This \"Ginger\" was Avey. BBC Television subsequently broadcast a documentary which included an emotional reunion between Avey and Susanne, where Avey sees Ernst's video testimony for the first time and realises that his cigarettes saved his life.\n\nAlthough Lobethal – now Lobet – made no mention on the video of having swapped uniforms with Avey, the documentary did include Avey's account of an exchange with an unnamed prisoner. An article by Broomby published at the time of the first broadcast suggested that he and the BBC had accepted the \"break-in\" story as also confirmed. Denis Avey was then received by British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to mark International Holocaust Remembrance Day, and in 2010 he was named a British Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government for having saved Ernst's life.\n\nThe following week Avey signed a book contract with Hodder and Stoughton to write his story. The book appeared in April 2011 with a foreword by Sir Martin Gilbert. The book, \"The Man who Broke into Auschwitz\", went on to be a best-seller and has been translated into a number of languages.\n\nBefore publication of his book, reaction from the mainstream media to his story was favourable. Subsequently, Guy Walters, writing in the \"Daily Mail\", doubted that Avey broke into Auschwitz as he claimed. Walters pointed out how hard it would have been to do without being caught, the absence of witness confirmation, and the length of Avey's silence, when his declared motive for entering the camp had been to report about his findings after the war.\n\nBrian Bishop, a British POW interviewed by Walters, while he did not claim to know Avey, stated \"I can’t understand how he did it. To do something like that you need to have several people helping on both sides — our side and the Jewish side.\" Similar doubt about the feat was expressed by Ron Jones, another British POW, who also found it hard to believe that Avey, a tall, fit, strong Englishman, could have passed himself off alongside \"starving six-stone Jews.\"\n\nNevertheless, British historian Lyn Smith, who interviewed Avey for the Imperial War Museum in 2001, insisted that he was an \"utterly reliable witness,\" and defended Avey in the face of these doubts, saying \"It's pitiful what happened to him.\" She included Avey in her book \"Heroes of the Holocaust\". Avey's publisher accepted that in his interview with Smith, Avey's recollections could be confused, but this was understandable given the stress suffered and that he was only then beginning to unburden himself after so many decades of silence.\n\nYad Vashem considered Avey for the honour Righteous among the Nations, but said it was unable to grant the award because it was unable to substantiate his account of the prisoner swap. In November 2014 Avey was reported as too ill to respond to further enquiries. He died on 16 July 2015 at Newholme Hospital in Bakewell, Derbyshire.\n\n\nAvey's 2001 interview with Lyn Smith is available online – see link below – and may also be heard in the \"Explore History\" section of the Imperial War Museum, London, during museum opening hours, without pre-booking. His account of entering Auschwitz is on reels 7 and 8, but is not mentioned in the index. The full text of Nicholas Hellen's article may be read through NewsBank.\n\n"}

According to the ritual, the building is identical; except that all the lights are out and the only thing the player would see outside is a red cross.\n\nThe ritual states that to return to the world that the player comes from, the player must use the same elevator. However, this may be difficult as you may be confused or the elevator goes farther away the closer you get. The steps must be done in the same sequence up to the fifth floor. Then the final button will return the player to the tenth floor, but the player must press another button in between and the first floor button to go to the first floor. The game rules ask the player to check for small things to be sure they are back in the real world and offer steps to do if the player considers this is not the case.\n\nAt the 5th floor, a mysterious woman may enter the elevator and try to lure the player. According to the rules of the game, the girl must not be talked to or acknowledged in any way. She is a spirit looking to misguide the player into bringing them into a different realm.\n"}

{"id": "5792266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5792266", "title": "Melvin Belli", "text": "Melvin Belli\n\nMelvin Mouron Belli (July 29, 1907 – July 9, 1996) was a prominent American lawyer known as \"The King of Torts\" and by insurance companies as \"Melvin Bellicose.\" He had many celebrity clients, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Errol Flynn, Chuck Berry, Muhammad Ali, The Rolling Stones, Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye Bakker, Martha Mitchell, Maureen Connolly, Lana Turner, Tony Curtis, and Mae West. He won during his legal career over $600 million in damages for his clients. He was also the attorney for Jack Ruby, who shot Lee Harvey Oswald for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nBelli was born in the California Gold Rush town of Sonora, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills. His parents were of Italian ancestry from Switzerland. His grandmother, Anna Mouron, was the first female pharmacist in California. By the 1920s, the family had moved to the city of Stockton, California where Belli attended Stockton High School.\n\nBelli graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1929. After traveling around the world, he received his law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley in 1933.\n\nFollowing his admission to the California bar, his first job was posing as a hobo for the Works Progress Administration and riding the rails to observe the Depression's impact on the country's vagrant population. His first major legal victory came shortly after graduation, in a personal injury lawsuit representing an injured cable car gripman. Over insurance lawyers' objections, Belli brought a model of a cable car intersection, and the gear box and chain involved in the accident, to demonstrate to jurors exactly what had happened.\n\nBesides his personal injury cases, which earned for him his byname \"King of Torts,\" Belli was instrumental in setting up some of the foundations of modern consumer rights law, arguing several cases in the 1940s and 1950s that formed the basis for later lawsuits and landmark litigation by such figures as Ralph Nader. Belli argued (in cases such as \"Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.,\" in 1944, which arose from an incident in which a restaurant manager from Merced, California was injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle) that all products have an implied warranty, that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people, not just the direct recipient of the manufactured product, and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective.\n\nIn his book \"Ready for the Plaintiff,\" Belli noted examples of negligence cited by himself and other personal-injury lawyers to win in court—for example, a colleague in Florida, who showed how a builder violated a building code in Miami Beach concerning the use of wooden shims in construction of outside walls (forbidden by the municipal code because of the effect of the ocean salt and air). The facing was a slab of Vitreous marble, whose adhesion was eventually weakened by the climate; it fell off the side of the building and injured a passerby, who sued the builder. After winning a court case, Belli would raise a Jolly Roger flag over his Montgomery Street office building in the Barbary Coast district of San Francisco (which Belli claimed had been a Gold Rush-era brothel) and fire a cannon, mounted on his office roof, to announce the victory and the impending party.\n\nIn his best-known case, Belli represented Jack Ruby, for free, after Ruby shot and killed Lee Harvey Oswald. Belli attempted to prove that Ruby was legally insane and had a history of mental illness in his family. On Saturday, March 14, 1964, Ruby was convicted of \"murder with malice\", and received a death sentence. Immediately thereafter, Ruby and his siblings fired Belli as they also hired and fired several other lawyers during the case. In late 1966, Ruby's conviction was overturned with help from other defense lawyers on the grounds that he did not receive a fair trial and a retrial was scheduled outside of Dallas, but Ruby died of cancer before the retrial could take place. Belli became very critical of FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover.\n\nIn 1969 a man called San Francisco police, identifying himself as the serial killer known as The Zodiac, and agreed to call talk show host Jim Dunbar on Dunbar's morning television talk show, \"A.M. San Francisco\" if either Belli or attorney F. Lee Bailey were present on air. The police contacted Belli and Dunbar to arrange this in the hopes of capturing the individual. As promised, the suspect called, spoke a few words, and then hung up, repeating this activity 54 times over the next two hours. Belli received a letter from the Zodiac that same year.\n\nBelli's firm filed for bankruptcy protection in December 1995. Belli was representing 800 women in a class action lawsuit against breast implant manufacturer Dow Corning. Belli won the lawsuit, but when Dow Corning declared bankruptcy, Belli had no way to recover the $5 million his firm had advanced to doctors and expert witnesses.\n\nIn the 1960s, Belli was among the leading members of the California plaintiffs bar who helped establish the California Trial Lawyers Association, which in the mid-1990s was renamed the Consumer Attorneys of California. The organization was established to help set standards and foment on-going legal education to help consumers have a better chance in court against the powerful legal teams amassed by the insurance companies and big corporations that typically were the defendants in accident, personal injury and other consumer lawsuits.\nBelli executive produced \"Tokyo File 212\" (1951), Hollywood's first film to be shot entirely in Japan. It featured Florence Marly and Robert Peyton in key roles.\n\nBelli appeared in \"And the Children Shall Lead\", a 1968 episode of the original \"\" series. In it he appears as \"Gorgan, the Friendly Angel\", an evil being who corrupts a group of children, one of whom was played by his son Caesar.\n\nHe appeared in the Albert and David Maysles documentary \"Gimme Shelter\" (1970), which featured his representation and facilitation of The Rolling Stones' staging of the disastrous December 6, 1969, Altamont Free Concert. Belli enjoyed his frequent television and movie appearances; in 1965, he told Alex Haley, interviewing him for \"Playboy\", that he \"might have been an actor\" if he had not become an attorney. In 1986 he played a criminal defense lawyer in an episode of the TV series \"Hunter\" entitled \"True Confessions.\"\n\nIn 1996 Belli recited the oratory to David Woodard's brass fanfare setting of Mark Twain's \"The War Prayer\" at Old First Church in San Francisco.\n\nBelli was played by Brian Cox in the 2007 film \"Zodiac\", in the scene that depicted Belli's conversation with the Zodiac suspect on \"A.M. San Francisco\".\n\nBelli was the author of several books, including the six-volume \"Modern Trials\" (written between 1954 and 1960) which has become a classic textbook on the demonstrative method of presenting evidence. Belli's unprecedented — and some thought undignified — use of graphic evidence and expert witnesses later became common courtroom practice. His autobiography, \"My Life on Trial\" is an account of his life and the noteworthy events he was involved in during his career. He also wrote the introduction to \"847.0 The Whiplash Injury\" by L. Ted Frigard, D.C. published in 1970. Dr. Frigard had helped Belli with his pain through chiropractic care.\n\nBelli was married six times and divorced five. His marriage to his fifth wife, the former Lia Georgia Triff, ended with a scandalous and acrimonious divorce proceeding in 1991. Belli accused his ex-wife of having an affair with archbishop Desmond Tutu and of throwing one of his dogs off the Golden Gate Bridge. He was fined $1,000 for repeatedly calling her \"El Trampo\". At one point, Belli was ejected from the courtroom after accusing the judge of sleeping with his former wife's lawyer. He was ultimately compelled to pay her an estimated $15 million. She later married a self-styled Romanian prince, Paul Lambrino. Belli married his sixth wife, Nancy Ho, on March 29, 1996. His youngest child, Melia, from fifth wife Lia, became an art history scholar, and is currently an assistant professor of Asian art history at the University of Texas at Arlington.\n\nBelli died of complications from pancreatic cancer, at his home in San Francisco, on July 9, 1996, aged 88. His death came suddenly, and in the presence of his wife Nancy. \"The New York Times\"' quoted his publicist Edward Lozzi saying, \"He was sitting; he just stopped breathing\". At the time of his death, he had three sons, three daughters, twelve grandchildren, and two dogs. He is buried in Odd Fellows Cemetery in Sonora, California, his birthplace.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Barrie's 1904 play \"Peter Pan\" and Barrie's own novelization of it, \"Peter and Wendy\". The music is mostly by Mark \"Moose\" Charlap, with additional music by Jule Styne, and most of the lyrics were written by Carolyn Leigh, with additional lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green.\n\nThe original 1954 Broadway production, starring Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook, earned Tony Awards for both stars. It was followed by NBC telecasts of it in 1955, 1956, and 1960 with the same stars, plus several rebroadcasts of the 1960 telecast. In 2014, the musical was broadcast on NBC featuring several new numbers, and starring Allison Williams and Christopher Walken. The show has enjoyed several revivals onstage.\n\nSeveral productions of Peter Pan were staged early in the 20th century, starting in London in 1904, starring Nina Boucicault as Peter and on Broadway in 1905, starring Maude Adams. In a nod to the original play, and the pantomime tradition it derives from, the title role of Peter Pan in the musical is usually played by a woman, including Mary Martin, Sandy Duncan and Cathy Rigby, among others.\n\nProducer Edwin Lester, founder and director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, acquired the American rights to adapt \"Peter Pan\" as a play with music for Mary Martin. The show was not successful in its pre-Broadway West Coast tour, so director Jerome Robbins hired lyricists Comden and Green and composer Jule Styne to add more songs, including \"Never Never Land,\" \"Distant Melody\" and several other numbers, turning the show into a full-scale musical. The musical, instead of using Barrie's original ending, in which Peter simply let Wendy and the other children return home, includes an additional scene that Barrie had written later and titled \"An Afterthought\" (later included by Barrie in his 1911 novelization \"Peter and Wendy\"). In this ending, Peter returns after many years to take Wendy back to Never Never Land for spring cleaning. He finds that he has been away so long that Wendy is now an adult, married woman with a daughter. Despondent at first, he is delighted when Wendy's daughter Jane offers to be his new mother, and instead takes her with him.\n\nThe musical premiered at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco on July 19, 1954. The initial four-week run was followed by an eight-week engagement in Los Angeles. The show opened on Broadway on October 20, 1954 at the Winter Garden Theatre for a planned limited run of 152 performances. The busy 1954 Broadway season also included \"The Boy Friend\", \"Fanny\", \"Silk Stockings\" and \"Damn Yankees\". While still in tryouts, a deal was made for \"Peter Pan\" to be broadcast on the NBC anthology series \"Producers' Showcase\" on March 7, 1955, which ensured that it was a financial success despite the limited run. The revised score and Tony Award-winning performances by Martin and Cyril Ritchard made the musical a critical success, and tickets sold out throughout the Broadway run. The show closed on February 26, 1955 to prepare for the television broadcast.\n\nA Broadway cast album was made of the songs, and it is still in print today.\n\nIn 1954, Fred Coe, production manager for NBC in New York, began work on \"Producers' Showcase\", a 90-minute anthology series that aired every fourth Monday for three seasons. One aim of the series was to broadcast expensive color spectaculars to promote the new color television system developed by NBC's parent company RCA.\nOn March 7, 1955, NBC presented \"Peter Pan\" live as part of \"Producers' Showcase\" (with nearly all of the show's original cast) as the first full-length Broadway production on color TV. The show attracted a then-record audience of 65-million viewers, the highest ever up to that time for a single television program. Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard had already won Tony Awards for their stage performances, and Martin won an Emmy Award for the television production. It was so well received that the musical was restaged live for television (again on \"Producers' Showcase\") on January 9, 1956. Both of these broadcasts were produced live and in color, but only black-and-white kinescope recordings survive.\n\n\"Peter Pan\" was restaged on December 8, 1960, this time in a 100-minute version rather than 90 minutes (not counting the commercials), and with a slightly different cast because the original children had outgrown their roles. \"Producers' Showcase\" had long since gone off the air, so the 1960 production was intended as a \"stand alone\" special instead of an episode of an anthology series. Act II was split into two acts, for a total of five acts instead of three, to allow for more commercial breaks. This version was videotaped in color at NBC's Brooklyn studio. Martin was also starring in Broadway's \"The Sound of Music\" at the time. The production was directed for television by Vincent J. Donehue, who received a Director's Guild Award for it. Peter Foy re-created the signature flying sequences he had staged for the 1954 Broadway production and the two Producers' Showcase broadcasts.\nThis 1960 version was rebroadcast in 1963, 1966 and 1973. The video tape of that production was restored and rebroadcast by NBC on March 24, 1989, then again on March 31, 1991, after which it went to the Disney Channel, where it was shown several times more. Beginning in 1989, the program was slightly cut to make room for more commercial time. Eliminated completely was a dance that Liza (the Darling family maid) and the animals of Neverland perform to an orchestral version of \"Never Never Land\". Also eliminated was Mary Martin's curtain speech at the end thanking NBC for making the program possible, which, in the 1960, 1963, and 1966 telecasts led directly into the closing credits. Gone also was the intertitle bearing the credit \"Peter Pan: Act III\", but not the other intertitle credits, so that the show seemed to be performed in three acts, just as in the stage version.\n\nThis 1960 production of \"Peter Pan\" was released on VHS home video in 1990 and on DVD on October 19, 1999. None of the three Mary Martin television versions of \"Peter Pan\" was telecast from a theatre with a live audience. All three were performed in the NBC studios. In 2000, A&E presented a TV production of the Broadway show, starring Cathy Rigby, recorded in front of a live audience.\n\nIn 2014, NBC broadcast \"Peter Pan Live!\", a new production of the musical starring Allison Williams as Peter, Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, Kelli O'Hara as Mrs. Darling, Christian Borle as Mr. Darling/Smee and Minnie Driver as the adult Wendy. Critical reviews were mixed, with many reviewers expressing relief that the broadcast was not a disaster.\n\nThe show was revived in 1979 on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, produced by Nancy and Ronnie Horowitz, starring Sandy Duncan and George Rose, and ran for 554 performances. Duncan was nominated for the Best Actress Tony, and the show was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical.\n\nA third Broadway production was mounted in 1990, originally at the Lunt-Fontanne, running for 45 performances. A return engagement opened 10 months later, this time at the Minskoff Theatre, running for an additional 48 performances. Both engagements starred former Olympic gymnast Cathy Rigby as Peter; the first co-starred Stephen Hanan and the second J. K. Simmons. The production was nominated for Best Revival of a Musical at the 1991 Tonys, and Rigby was nominated for Best Actress. Rigby returned to Broadway as Peter Pan in 1998 at the Marquis Theatre, with Paul Schoeffler co-starring. This production ran for 48 performances. A return engagement with the same stars opened in 1999 at the George Gershwin Theatre and ran for 166 performances. This engagement was nominated for the 1999 Tony for Best Revival of a Musical.\nIt was then recorded at the La Mirada Theater for broadcast in October 2000 on the A&E Network. The video release cuts the program to about 96 minutes and was shot using eight cameras, produced by Line By Line Productions for McCoy/Rigby Entertainment, directed by Gary Halvorson and produced by Marc Bauman. Designers of the production were John Iacovelli (set), Shigeru Yaji (costumes) and Martin Aronstein (lights). Flying illusions are by ZFX Inc. Craig Barna is the musical director. It reconceived the potentially offensive \"Ugg-a-Wugg\" song about Native Americans as a percussive dance number. The flying effects were changed to include some flights that were not practical to do in the theatrical version, such as the somersault flips during \"I'm Flying\", and electronically erasing the wires.\n\nJack Noseworthy is the only male actor to have played Peter Pan on Broadway; he was an understudy in the revue \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\".\n\nThe Darling Nursery\n\nAs Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for an evening out, two of their children, Wendy and John, play at being their parents. When Mrs. Darling notices Michael is left out, she gets him into the game and joins in with all of them (\"1, 2, 3\") watched by the dog Nana, their nursemaid. When Mr. Darling comes in to have his tie tied, he questions having a dog as a nursemaid, but Mrs. Darling defends her. The previous week, while the children slept, Nana saw a boy in the room who flew out of the window before she could catch him, leaving behind his shadow, which Mrs. Darling has put away in a drawer. In spite of this, Mr. Darling insists on Nana spending the night downstairs. Mrs. Darling and the children sing a lullaby (\"Tender Shepherd\").\n\nThe children fall asleep. A fairy, Tinker Bell, and Peter Pan fly in through the window to look for his shadow. Wendy is woken up by the boy's cries when he is unable to re-attach his shadow and helps him by sewing it back on. Peter is thrilled when his shadow is re-attached (\"I've Gotta Crow\") and tells her that he lives in Neverland (\"Never Never Land\") with the Lost Boys. Wendy wakes her brothers up, and Peter invites them all to Neverland, and promises to teach them to fly. Peter happily launches himself into the air (\"I'm Flying\").\n\nPeter sprinkles the children with fairy dust and tells them to \"think lovely thoughts\" (\"I'm Flying – Reprise\"). The children follow Peter, but Michael goes back when maid Liza comes into the room, giving her some of his fairy dust and inviting her to come to Neverland with them.\n\nNever Land\n\nPeter's \"Lost Boys\" are standing outside their underground lair, wondering when he will return, when they hear Captain Hook and his pirates (\"Pirate Song\"). The boys hide. Hook tells Smee, his right-hand man, that he wants to kill Peter, because he cut off his hand and threw it to a crocodile, which has since then developed a taste for Hook and follows him around. Luckily for Hook, the crocodile has swallowed a clock that ticks and alerts Hook to its presence. Hook accidentally stumbles upon the entrance to the hideout, and summons Smee and his men to provide background music while he plans the Boys' demise (\"Hook's Tango\"), a rich cake with poisonous icing. Hook suddenly hears a loud tick-tock; the crocodile appears but Hook escapes. The pirates flee, and the Boys reappear, thinking they are safe. Suddenly, a group of \"Indians\" appears, led by Tiger Lily (\"Indians\"). They leave the Boys alone, and go on hunting the pirates.\n\nThe Lost Boys suddenly spot Wendy in the sky and taking her for a bird, one of them shoots an arrow. Peter, Michael and John land to find the arrow lodged in her heart, although she isn't dead. The Lost Boys build a house around her, hoping that she will become their mother (\"Wendy\"), to which, when she wakes up, she agrees. Hook plants the cake, but Wendy doesn't let the children eat it as she knows it wouldn't be good for them; instead, she tells the Boys stories. Hook is infuriated that the Boys have found a mother. He plots to kidnap Wendy and the Boys, while Smee and the pirates play a \"Tarantella\". After the pirates leave for their ship, Liza arrives and dances with the animals of Neverland while Peter keeps watch outside the house.\n\nA few days pass with everyone having adventures. One day in the forest, after Peter leads the Boys in their anthem (\"I Won't Grow Up\"), they almost run into the pirates, who have captured Tiger Lily and tie her to a tree. Peter hides and mimics Hook's voice, ordering the men to release her. When Hook arrives, he is enraged and demands that the \"spirit of the forest\" speak to him. Peter tricks them all into thinking he is Hook, and that the real Hook is a codfish. Hook asks the \"spirit\" to reveal its true identity. Peter obliges, pretending to be a \"beautiful lady\" (\"Oh, My Mysterious Lady\") and Hook and his pirates try to ambush Peter, but they are chased away by Tiger Lily and her tribe of Native Americans.\n\nBack at the hideout, Tiger Lily and her tribe are almost shot by the Boys, until Peter reveals the truce between them. They smoke a peace pipe and vow eternal friendship (\"Ugg-a-Wugg\"). Tiger Lily and her Indians leave to stand guard around the house above. Wendy asks Peter to sing the Boys a lullaby (\"Distant Melody\"). Michael and John want to return home, and Wendy admits to being homesick, too. The Boys wish they had parents, and Wendy offers hers to all of them. Everyone is excited about being adopted, except Peter, who says he will not go because he knows he will grow up if he does. Wendy tells him she will come back once a year to do his spring cleaning.\n\nThe pirates attack and subdue the Indians. They give Peter a fake all-clear signal, so Peter sadly sends Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys on their way. Before she leaves, Wendy sets out Peter's \"medicine\" for him to take before bed. After she tearfully leaves, Peter, who pretended not to care, throws himself on a bed and cries himself to sleep. As they leave the underground house, Wendy and the boys are captured by the pirates. Hook then sneaks into the lair and poisons Peter's medicine. Tinker Bell awakens Peter, tells him of the ambush, and warns him about the poison, but he waves her off as he prepares for a rescue. Desperate, she drinks the poison herself. Dying, she tells Peter that if every boy and girl who believes in fairies would clap their hands, she would live. Peter asks the audience to believe and clap their hands. They do, and Tinker Bell is saved. Peter grabs his sword and heads off to rescue Wendy and the Boys.\n\nThe Jolly Roger\n\nHook revels in his success (\"Hook's Waltz\"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the \"doodle-doo\" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (\"I've Gotta Crow\" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (\"I Gotta Crow\" [2nd reprise]).\n\nBack home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (\"Tender Shepherd\" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (\"We Will Grow Up\"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her.\n\nYears pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, \"Boy, why are you crying?\" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, \"Oh, if only I could go with you!\" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, \"You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up\". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, \"just for Spring cleaning.\" Her daughter and the \"boy who wouldn't grow up\" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window.

Serber's lectures explaining the basic principles and goals of the project were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as \"The Los Alamos Primer\". The \"New York Times\" called him “the intellectual midwife at the birth of the atomic bomb.”\n\nHe was born in Philadelphia as the eldest son of David Serber and Rose Frankel in a Jewish family. He married Charlotte Leof (26 Jul 1911 – 1967) in 1933, the daughter of his stepmother's uncle. Rose Serber died in 1922 and David married Charlotte's cousin Frances Leof in 1928. He earned his B.S. in engineering physics from Lehigh University in 1930 and earned his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with John Van Vleck in 1934. \n\nShortly before receiving his doctorate, Serber was selected for a National Research Council postdoctoral fellowship and planned on conducting research at Princeton University with Eugene Wigner. However, after spontaneously enrolling at the University of Michigan's physics summer school, he changed his plans and went to work with J. Robert Oppenheimer at the University of California, Berkeley. For the next four years, he shuttled with Oppenheimer between Berkeley and the California Institute of Technology, where Oppenheimer held a secondary faculty appointment. In 1938, he took one of the era's few tenure-track professorships in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he stayed until he was recruited for the Manhattan Project.\n\nHe was recruited for the Manhattan Project in 1941, and was in Project Alberta on the dropping of the bomb. When the Los Alamos National Laboratory was first organized, Oppenheimer decided not to compartmentalize the technical information among different departments. This increased the effectiveness of the technical workers in problem solving, and emphasized the urgency of the project in their minds, now they knew what they were working on. So it fell to Serber to give a series of lectures explaining the basic principles and goals of the project. These lectures were printed and supplied to all incoming scientific staff, and became known as \"The Los Alamos Primer\", LA-1. It was declassified in 1965. Serber developed the first good theory of bomb assembly hydrodynamics.\nSerber's wife Charlotte Serber was appointed by Oppenheimer to head the technical library at Los Alamos, where she was the only wartime female section leader.\n\nSerber created the code-names for all three design projects, the \"Little Boy\" (uranium gun), \"Thin Man\" (plutonium gun), and \"Fat Man\" (plutonium implosion), according to his reminiscences (1998). The names were based on their design shapes; the \"Thin Man\" would be a very long device, and the name came from the Dashiell Hammett detective novel and series of movies of the same name; the \"Fat Man\" bomb would be round and fat and was named after Sydney Greenstreet's character in \"The Maltese Falcon\" (from Hammett's novel). \"Little Boy\" would come last and be named only to contrast to the \"Thin Man\" bomb. This differs from the unsupported theory, now abandoned, that \"Fat Man\" was named after Churchill and \"Thin Man\" after Roosevelt (see Links).\n\nSerber was to go on the camera plane for the Nagasaki mission, \"Big Stink\", but it left without him when group operations officer Major James I. Hopkins ordered him off the plane as he had forgotten his parachute, reportedly after the B-29 had already taxied onto the runway. Since Serber (who was commissioned as a colonel in the United States Army for the mission and thus technically outranked Hopkins) was the only crew member who knew how to operate the high-speed camera, Hopkins had to be instructed by radio from Tinian on its use. Serber was with the first American team to enter Hiroshima and Nagasaki to assess the results of the atomic bombing of the two cities.\n\nIn 1948, Serber had to defend himself against anonymous accusations of disloyalty, mostly because his wife Charlotte's family were Jewish intellectuals with socialist leanings, and also because he tried to remove politics from discussions of the feasibility of the fusion bomb, leading to arguments with Edward Teller. Although he had been cleared of any potential wrongdoing at a subsequent hearing that year, he was denied a prerequisite security clearance for a Japanese physics conference in 1952, precipitating his refusal to join a Teller-chaired Department of Defense advisory group. \n\nNevertheless, Serber went on to consult numerous labs, businesses, and commissions, including Brookhaven National Laboratory (where he worked one day a week during the academic year and occasional summers for twenty years) and Fermilab. Although largely bereft of any ideology, he refused to join JASON because of his previous clearance issues and opposition to the Vietnam War.\n\nIn 1951, he became a professor of physics at Columbia University. He served as chair of the department from 1975 until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1978.\n\nIn 1972 Serber was awarded the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize.\n\nRobert Serber is interviewed in the Oscar-nominated documentary, \"The Day After Trinity\" (1980). In the 1989 movie dramatization of the Manhattan Project, \"Fat Man and Little Boy\", the role of Robert Serber is played by H. David Politzer, a professor of theoretical physics at Caltech. Politzer was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2004.\n\nSerber died June 1, 1997 at his home in Manhattan from complications following surgery for brain cancer.\n\n\n"}

It has grown from a gathering of 5 hot air balloons to a competition where over 3500 people volunteer, and has gained a reputation as one of the top ballooning competitions in the world. It is also a popular time for tourists as the Karatsu Kunchi Festival is held at the same time in Karatsu City. Since 1980 the launch site has been visited by over 10 million spectators.\n\nFor the duration of the event, a temporary JR station (Balloon Saga Station) ferries passengers between Saga City and Kubota. \n\nThe fiesta started in 1978 in Amagi City, Fukuoka Prefecture, as a smaller ballooning event, the \"Balloon Fiesta in Kyushu.\" In 1980 the Fiesta was moved to the outskirts of Saga City, where there is more room. In 1984 it became an international competition and was given its present name; in the same year the first Japanese National Hot Air Balloon Championship was held, and balloonists from all over Japan came to the grounds.\n\nSince 1984 there have been approximately 640 balloons from overseas participants (nearly 3000 crew and pilots). In 1990 the first Pacific Championship was held in Saga. Between 1990 and 1996 women from around the world gathered to participate in the Ladies World Cup. Saga was the first place to have a competition of this kind.\n\nBeginning in 1992 a category for special shaped balloons, called \"Balloon Fantasia\" was created.

{"id": "3582100", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3582100", "title": "Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)", "text": "Shakespeare in the Park (New York City)\n\nShakespeare in the Park (or Free Shakespeare in the Park) is a theatrical program that stages productions of Shakespearean plays at the Delacorte Theater, an open-air theater in New York City's Central Park. The theater and the productions are managed by The Public Theater and tickets are distributed free of charge on the day of the performance. Originally branded as the New York Shakespeare Festival (NYSF) under the direction of Joseph Papp, the institution was renamed in 2002 as part of a larger reorganization by the Public Theater.\n\nThe festival was originally conceived by director-producer Joseph Papp in 1954. Papp began with a series of Shakespeare workshops, then moved on to free productions on the Lower East Side. Eventually, the plays moved to a lawn in front of Turtle Pond in Central Park. In 1959, parks commissioner Robert Moses demanded that Papp and his company charge a fee for the performances to cover the cost of \"grass erosion.\" A court battle ensued. Papp continued to fight Moses, winning his enduring respect and the quote \"well, let's build the bastard a theater.\" Following this, Moses requested funds from the city for the construction of an amphitheater in the park. In 1961, the Delacorte Theater was built. The first performance held in the theater in 1962 was Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice\", starring George C. Scott and James Earl Jones.\n\nThe Delacorte Theater is an open-air amphitheater located on the southwest corner of the Great Lawn in Central Park, closest to the entrance at 81st Street and Central Park West. It was built in 1961 and named for George T. Delacorte, Jr., who donated money for its creation. Belvedere Castle and Turtle Pond provide a backdrop for the shows at the Delacorte. As shows at the Delacorte begin in the early evening, shows usually start in daylight; as the play rolls on, the sun sets and the audience is drawn into the illuminated action on the stage. Since 1962 the Public has had the privilege of its exclusive use.\n\nTickets to Shakespeare in the Park are free and tickets for a given performance are distributed the same day by various methods:\n\nShakespeare in the Park also offers specific performances throughout the summer for patrons with hearing and/or vision loss including Sign Language interpreted performances, audio-described performances, and open-captioned performances.\n\nEach summer since the Delacorte's opening has seen between one and three works produced, with two works being standard since 1973. The plays of Shakespeare account for about four-fifths of the works produced, and, except for 1977 and 1980, each summer's line-up has included at least one work by Shakespeare (or, in the case of 1970, one work adapted from Shakespeare). Non-Shakespeare productions have included plays such as Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" and Henrik Ibsen's \"Peer Gynt\" and musicals such as \"On the Town\", \"Two Gentlemen of Verona\", and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\", the latter two having made their world debuts at the Delacorte.\n\nThe 2017 production of \"Julius Caesar\" stirred up controversy over the similarities between President Donald Trump and the production's portrayal of Caesar. Despite the fact that the play, which revolves around the murder of Caesar, is widely viewed as a cautionary tale against political violence and \"the use of antidemocratic means to defend a democracy\", commentators objected to what they characterized as the murder of a stand-in for President Trump. In response to online backlash, Delta and Bank of America withdrew their sponsorship of the production. One performance was interrupted by activists Laura Loomer and Jack Posobiec.\n\nThe Public Theater is heavily reliant on private donors. In 2005, the theater company was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation, which was made possible through a donation by then-NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg.\n\nMany plays from the summer festival have gone on to Broadway, including Wilford Leach's staging of \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood\" from the 1984–1985 season and \"The Tempest\" from the 1995–1996 season. The festival has also attracted many well-known actors, such as Meryl Streep, Morgan Freeman, Martin Sheen, and Al Pacino – the latter two of whom appeared as Brutus and Marc Antony in a toga-clad historical production of \"Julius Caesar\", directed by Stuart Vaughan in 1987, in the first of the NYSF's Shakespeare Marathon. Since its inception, the festival has become popular with both New York natives and visitors to the city, and while the Delacorte Theater has 1,872 seats, prospective theatergoers can expect to sit in line for hours before the early afternoon ticket distribution. Approximately 80,000 people attend Shakespeare in the Park every year.\n\nOver the years, the New York Shakespeare Festival supported other theatre companies throughout New York, helping to foster the growth of Off-Broadway, as well as specific theatre programs and projects. Among these companies that benefited from NYSF during critical periods of their development was the Theatre for a New Audience. The Theatre for a New Audience developed a number of productions sponsored by the NYSF, including \"A Midsummer Nights Dream\", presented at the Ansbacher Theatre, and through this sponsorship, the company was able to grow and expand its outreach to new audiences. Another such company was the Riverside Shakespeare Company. The Festival, under Papp's leadership, sponsored several Riverside Shakespeare Company productions at a critical stage in its development, beginning with Riverside's New York premiere production of Brecht's \"Edward II\" in 1982 at The Shakespeare Center on the Upper West Side (dedicated by Joseph Papp in 1982), followed by Equity parks tours of free Shakespeare throughout the five boroughs of New York City, much as the NYSF had done for years before. Riverside Shakespeare Company summer parks tour of Free Shakespeare sponsored by the NYSF began with \"A Comedy of Errors\" in 1982, followed by \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", featuring Anna Deavere Smith in her New York stage debut as Mistress Quickly, \"Romeo and Juliet\", and \"The Taming of the Shrew\". During the NYSF period of support, the Riverside Shakespeare Company expanded greatly, offering for the first time The Shakespeare Project in 1983, and serving a wide range of audiences in the five boroughs.\n\n\n"}

It was released in Europe only, on 12\" vinyl. This song failed to follow up on the success of \"Radio Free Europe\" released earlier in the year, as it did not chart. A live performance at Larry's Hideaway, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from July 9, 1983 was released on the 2008 Deluxe Edition reissue of Murmur.\n\n\"Talk About the Passion\" is a \"hunger song\", although the only direct reference in the song is to \"empty mouths\". Michael Stipe has stated, \"Talk About the Passion\" was a song about hunger but the lyrics weren't clear enough. The video, made in 1988 and featured on the compilations \"Pop Screen\" and \"When the Light Is Mine\", made this meaning of the song more explicit by showing images of homeless people and images of an aircraft carrier, ending with the caption, \"in 1987 the cost of one destroyer-class warship was 910 million dollars.\"\n\nThe song contains a line in French—\"Combien de temps?\", which means \"How much time?\" or \"For how long?\" The song also includes the line \"Combien reaction?\", which is a blend of English and French that can be taken to mean, \"How much reaction?\"\n\nThe song was included on R.E.M.'s first I.R.S.

It was originally claimed that the book was written by a Tibetan monk named Lobsang Rampa. On investigation the author was found to be a British plumber named Cyril Henry Hoskin (1910-1981), who claimed that his body was occupied by the spirit of a Tibetan monk named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa. The book is considered a hoax.\n\nThe story of \"The Third Eye\" begins in Tibet during the reign of the 13th Dalai Lama. Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, the son of a Lhasa aristocrat, takes up theological studies and is soon recognised for his prodigious abilities. As he enters adolescence, the young Rampa undertakes increasingly challenging feats until he is recognised as a crucial asset to the future of an independent Tibet. Tibet's Lamas had foretold a future in which China would attempt to reassert its authority, and Rampa is operated upon to help him preserve his country. A third eye is drilled into his forehead, allowing him to see human auras and to determine people's hidden motivations.\n\nWith his third eye, Rampa can serve as an aide in the Dalai Lama's court and spy on visitors to the court as they are being received. The visitors upon whom Rampa spies include the scholar Sir Charles Alfred Bell, deemed by Rampa as naive but benevolent. In contrast, Rampa and others are certain that Chinese visitors are nefarious and are soon to attempt to bring conquest and destruction to Tibet. Tibet must then prepare for an invasion. During the story, Rampa meets yetis, and at the end of the book he encounters a mummified body that was him in an earlier incarnation. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the planet Earth was struck by another planet, causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today. The popularity of the book led to two sequels, \"The Doctor from Lhasa\" and \"The Rampa Story\", and Lobsang Rampa wrote over a dozen books in all.\n\nAlthough it is claimed by the author to be an authentic autobiography of Rampa's education as a monk born in Tibet, the book's emphasis on the occult made scholars doubtful about its origins. The book includes a description of a surgical operation similar to trepanation in which a third eye is drilled into the forehead of Rampa, allegedly in order to enhance his psychic powers. After the book became a bestseller, Heinrich Harrer, explorer and Tibetologist, hired the private detective Clifford Burgess to investigate the background of the author. In February 1958 the results of the investigation were published in the \"Daily Mail\". The author of the book turned out to be a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who came from Plympton in Devon and was the son of a plumber. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. When interviewed by the British press, Hoskin (who had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon So in 1948) admitted that he had written the book. He claimed in his 1960 book \"The Rampa Story\" that his body had been taken over by the Tibetan monk's spirit after falling out of an apple tree in the garden of his home. Hoskin always maintained that his books were true stories and denied any suggestions of a hoax.\n\nAlthough detractors regard the book as a myth of Cyril Hoskin's own creation, \"The Third Eye\" and its sequels remain the most popular publications claiming to represent life in Tibet. The dismissal of the book as a fabrication by scholars did not undermine its popularity, despite the lack of records of Rampa ever having lived and its depiction of events that are not found in the standard literature describing life in a Tibetan monastery.\n\nGordon Stein in \"Encyclopedia of Hoaxes\" (1993) has written:\n\n"}

In general, road managers handle small to medium-sized tours, and tour managers are used on large-scale tours.\n\nThe performances on a concert tour are booked by the act’s booking agent, who works with concert promoters to place the act in suitable venues and festivals in a time frame and territory agreed with the act’s management. Individual concert promoters negotiate the financial, technical and hospitality requirements of the artist and make an offer to the booking agent for the show. The tour is announced and tickets put on sale when agreement is reached on the tour dates. As modern concert touring involves complex financial, legal and technical arrangements, the booking agent or artist manager hire a concert tour manager to organize the logistics. Concert tour managers are usually freelancers working on a tour-by-tour basis.\n\nThe tour manager is given the itinerary for the tour by the booking agent. Working from this itinerary, the tour manager handles the following activities.\n\nThe itinerary includes information about the potential ticket income (fees) for each show. Using this information the tour manager can produce a budget for the tour, calculating costs for crew wages, per diems, accommodation, transport, sound, lighting and video equipment, visas and work permits, rehearsals and other expenses such as booking agent commissions.

Throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 of March in 1999 during the Kosovo War, most of the men were killed from the Yugoslav Army. The women and children fled Krushe e Madhe and headed to the Albanian border. Once the war was over and they returned, their entire village was flat because all their houses, schools, etc. had been burned to the ground.\n\nThese women who were now the heads of households decided to change their fate and become the income generators of the village. Not only did they bring in money for their families, but also drastically developed Krusha and its economy. When they returned, they lived in extreme poverty and horrible living conditions but through opening small businesses and continuously expanding their market share, they managed to get out of it. Although this village still needs growth and improvement. Maximum dexterity has been given by the women towards trying to help their families have a better life and seeing the village’s economy thrive.\n\nKrusha e Madhe is located in the municipality of Rahovec, Kosovo. It is considered to be the second biggest village in Kosovo.\nThe population of Krusha e Madhe is estimated to be around 7,000 citizens.\n\nThe agricultural areas of Krusha e Madhe are rich with an overall of 630 hectares of fertile land. The fertile lands of Krusha e Madhe impact the economy. More than 16 hectares of the land are used for planting different vegetables, including 6 hectares of peppers, 2 hectares of potatoes, 2 hectares of onions and cucumbers, and other vegetables. An agricultural cooperative is currently open, which is mostly renowned for processed vegetables. Through it, farmers aim to increase the market share of vegetables in Kosovo and in neighboring countries. In general, Kosovo is rich with fertile land in which different vegetables and fruits are cultivated. Thus, Kosovo tends to be a country with a variety of traditional recipes and common vegetables such as ajvar, pickles, cheese and other dairy products. After the war and Massacre at Krusha e Madhe in 1999, the women of Krusha e Madhe formed multiple women’s associations and presented themselves to the marketplace by selling pickles alone at the beginning. Afterwards, they managed to expand their market share by opening micro-enterprises such as Apetiti, \"Krushe\" cooperative, and Drita e Krushes. These small businesses are supplied with processed vegetables and other traditional.\n\nThe people of Krusha e Madhe have witnessed one of the greatest war disasters of the Kosovo War in 1999. The interesting yet tragic fact about the Massacre at Krusha e Madhe is that most, if not all, of the men there were killed and most of their bodies have still not been found.\n\nThe war in Krusha e Madhe is noted to be a massacre due to the population indictment against the Serbian Military.\nIn 1999, the village of Krusha e Madhe has been attacked by the Serbian armed forces and most of the territory was destroyed. At first, it started with the residents of Krusha e Madhe being forced to leave their own village and once they did, the houses of these villagers were all burnt to their roots. The Serbian army ordered the male villagers to gather and line up. The men ranged from the age of 14 to 73. Afterwards, their houses, personal documents, and valuables were burned. Most importantly, all of these men were Killed. Their families (women and children) were forced to leave the place and head to the forests near the village. Many immediately went in the direction of the country of Albania.\n\nTwo years after the devastation of the resident, there has been an exhibition held in Krusha e Madhe in which everything experienced from these villagers was presented. In this event, the massacre was being presented with different pictures, real skeletons, and executed bodies. There have been statistical data about this massacre and the overall number of these deaths throughout the dates 25, 26 and 27 March 1999. According to BBC news approximately 105 Kosovo Albanian males were murdered by the Serbian Police and 793 houses were burned down. However, there are also a lot of people missing whose bodies were never found, so the number of casualties totals up to 241 civilians. Additionally, there were 8 massive graves, 2 crematoriums and many other individual graves. Overall, today there are 139 widows and approximately 500 children left as orphans.\n\nBased on reports from OSCE, Human Rights Watch and many other press accounts, Krusha e Madhe is considered to be one of the most damaged villages as a result of the 1999 war in Kosovo, and it is known to be the village of widowed women. The women, in absence of their men, had to become the heads of households and protect their families. Years after the war, their houses were finally rebuilt, which was the first step towards recovery.\n\nAfter the war, some of the women of Krusha e Madhe established an association called “Widowed Women” (Grate e Veja) which initially wanted to focus on finding missing people from the region. After it received no attention or support, the women of the association decided to get to work and provide for their families. They started doing work that used to be done by the men like planting the soil and farming. The association quickly became well-known and was changed to the “Krusha” agricultural cooperative which sold vegetables and processed (canned) ones. As the requests multiplied, so did the number of workers and productions. There are currently around 25 women who work full-time with the help of almost a hundred others who contribute in different ways. Out of the 25 women, 23 of them are widows whose husbands are either missing or were killed during the Massacre of Krusha e Madhe. Today, the cooperative supplies 28 markets around Kosovo with different products that are based on traditional recipes. \nAlthough, even with the cooperative’s success, many of the families of Krusha still need social assistance to get by. This is mainly because the work they do is seasonal (when the crops grow). \nWomen of Krusha e Madhe have changed their own fate. Before the women of this place changed the state of it and developed its economy, extreme poverty and horrible life conditions were the norm. They gave their absolute maximum to help their families live a better, secure life.\n\nThe Rahovec municipality, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD), USAID, and other sponsors, were all supporters of a workshop for farmers and the growing of their crops. Around €80,000 were invested in this workshop and 30 women of Krusha who are widows are hired full-time to work with the crops. The workshop's opening was on May 30, 2011 in Krusha e Madhe with various politicians and donors present. This investment in the village’s agriculture is considered to be one of the best initiatives by the MAFRD to help female farmers who suffered during the war provide a more secure future for their families. In this workshop, the village residents learn to take care of crops, use them to create final products, and then sell them in the markets. Before this project, the women of Krusha e Madhe worked by hand, but now, with donations from different organizations and ministries, they can work faster and more efficiently with the use of different machines. These investments are a huge success as Krusha e Madhe is a leader in the selling of vegetables like pickles, tomatoes, peppers, potatoes etc. It is also known for the production of ajvar, a widely popular type of relish in Kosovo. The opening of the new production line which included ajvar was made possible by additional donations from USAID and Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Rural Development (MAFRD).\n\nPurchases and sales presented in the following table (Table 1) describe the detailed flow of \"Ola\" Enterprise and women processors from Krushe. One can clearly see the usefulness of this type of business model since the gross profit justifies the investments made initially.\n\nTable 1. Purchases and sales of \"Ola\" Enterprise - September 2008 - August 2009\n\nIn 1999, the women of Krusha e madhe were left without homes and with no source of income. One of the first initiatives to help these women was from Ms. Ola Syla, the founder and manager of an NGO called \"Drita e Krushes\"\n\n\"Drita e Krushes\" representatives traveled from Prishtina to Krusha e Madhe for many times ever since 1999, in order to help the women who were left widows after the massacre of Krusha. At first, they had to set up a non-governmental organization (NGO) in which the assistance would be donations from different international organizations. These projects were donor drive since the women of Krusha e Madhe had no previous experience in entrepreneurship. With the aids given, the goods were initially transported from Krusha e Madhe to the citizens of Prishtina. For four years, the goods were ordered from familiar people of heads of the organization and it got popular in that manner. However, this way of exporting goods was not efficient enough. With the help of Swiss InterCoropration the women of Krusha were supplied with jars to use for the processed vegetables. They were placed on shelves in a store which was opened in Prishtina in 2001. At that period, the production of processed vegetables was promoted and once it started, the business had great success. First they started off with a small room where 20 employees were hired and only 300 kg of peppers were available. Looking at the fact that these were sold out very fast, the quantity of production had to increase. In 2002, the women participated in the AgroKos fair, which is an agricultural fair which aims to give farmers the opportunity to present their crops and products. For their traditional recipes, the women of Krusha won the gold medal.\n\nFor seven years in a row, \"Drita e Krushes\" was the only business in Kosovo selling traditional products and processed vegetables which were made in rural areas. In 2004, the business which was opened in Prishtina expanded with a depot and a working space due to the funds collected from donations. In this year, the store had 300 women employed working on the products. The women received a wage monthly and this income was used in a very beneficial way to develop their lives.\n\nDonators:\n\nIn the initial phases of “Drita e Krushes”, its representatives in association with Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation organized various informal trainings for the women in the organization. This skills development program in Krusha had three main intervention strategies: Opportunity Groups (learning groups), Private Sector training and Supply Chain linkages. The trainings were very basic and tackled matters like sanitation maintenance, reading and writing, and working with the machines donated from the organizations mentioned above. The purpose of all this is to deliver enhanced services to developing communities, unemployed people, and private, small businesses like those in Krusha e Madhe.\n\nIn 2005, Fahrije Hoti from Krusha e Madhe, whose husband is still on the missing persons list, initiated an organization called “Grate e Veja” (The widowed Women), to seek assistance on investigation of the missing persons. However, achieving minimal results on revealing the fate of missing persons, the women of Krusha e madhe had to get back to their primary duties such as nurturing their children, normalize their life and generate income. In the same year, they started operating under the name of the organization, planting and renewing their lands. Soon they started producing traditional recipes and conserving winter food. With the demands rising, this organization expanded its producing capacities and started hiring more women. This was important because with the help of various organizations, families of Krusha e Madhe could live their lives again with better life conditions.\n\nIn 2010, “Grate e veja” was transformed in the agricultural cooperative called “Krusha\", an independent non-profit organization (NGO). Its profits and any other income generated are used to support those in financial need and further expand their NGO. The main offices of “Krusha” are located in the village of Krusha e Madhe and in the Municipality of Rahovec. The official representative of this organization is Fahrije Hoti and there are in overall five members that make up the organization’s board. In addition, “Krusha” has both permanent and seasonal workers.\n\nOne of the primary goals of “Krusha” organization is to create the necessary conditions for the widowed women to run their businesses on their own. So far, positive results are seen regarding the development of women’s organizational and entrepreneurial skills. This has helped them to be engaged in cultivating their agricultural goods and be able to manage the economical as well as financial aspects of their businesses. One of the many projects of “Krusha” organization involved enabling women to receive driving licenses so that they would be more independent in terms of moving freely from the village to other business destinations. In addition, with the unique traditional recipe, this cooperative has managed to supply its products to approximately 28 markets in numerous cities of Kosovo.\n\n\n"}

World Youth Day is a celebration of faith begun by Pope John Paul II held on an international level every two to three years, and WYD2002 was the 10th such event. Although WYD is designed for Catholics, it attracts sizable numbers of youths from other faiths and denominations and was presented as a multi-faith celebration of young people from all over the world.\n\nAs the event is ultimately an expression of faith, and a critical expression of faith is through service to others, World Youth Day 2002 had the support of some 25,000 volunteers; and some 100,000 pilgrims themselves spent three hours each on one of 750 service projects.\n\nThe groundswell of Catholic spirituality following World Youth Day 2002 in Canada led to the establishment of Canada's first national Catholic television network, Salt + Light Television. Fr. Thomas Rosica, who was the National Director of WYD2002, is also the founder and Chief Executive Officer of this new television station.\n\nFor the third time (after Buenos Aires 1987 and Denver 1993) the World Youth Day was celebrated in the Américas.\nThe Chief Executive Officer and National Director of these WYD was Father Thomas Rosica.\n\nThe Pope announced the decision to organize the WYD in Toronto during the Angelus of August 20, 2000 held on the large esplanade of Tor Vergata at the end of the World Youth Day 2000. These are his words:\n\n\"Before I dissolve this great and beautiful assembly, I wish to announce that the next World Youth Meeting will take place in Toronto, Canada, in the summer of the Duemilayue. As I now invite the young people of the world to walk towards that goal, I address a special greeting to the Canadian Delegation, who wanted to be present at this celebration to collect the delivery of the future commitment. On them and on the assignment I assume today I invoke the protection of the Blessed Virgin.\"\n\nThe theme of the event was a fragment from Jesus' speech on the Mount of Beatitudes:\n\n\"You are the salt of the earth ... you are the light of the world\". (Matthew 5:13-14).\n\nThe World Youth Day began with a pre-program in numerous Canadian dioceses.\n\nFrom 18 to 21 July, for the first time the international guests were also invited to stay in 35 dioceses throughout Canada (mostly in Montreal and Quebec). In this way they experienced local culture; they also carried out social activities in the cities where they resided; they prayed with the young Canadians, and they organized parties and concerts.\n\nThe young pilgrims arrived to the Canadian diocese to Toronto on 22 July. They took up accommodation in the lodgings. They had the first meetings with the young people of the city.\n\nThe official start in Toronto was the opening show on Tuesday, July 23 at 16:00 local time. Archbishop of Toronto, Cardinal Aloysius Ambrozic celebrated the opening mass at 5 pm in the Exhibition Place, a vast exhibition area near Lake Ontario.

An area of the park was also dedicated to Eucharistic adoration. In the afternoon the Youth Festival opened, where they found space for a varied panorama of artistic, cultural and spiritual experiences based on the life and faith of young people from all over the world; exhibitions, vigils, concerts, round tables, films, dances and theatrical events were organized at Exhibition Place.\nAt the Molson Amphitheatre in Toronto, there was a meeting between Italians and Italian young people, many in Canada. Among the artists present were Antonella Ruggiero, Paolo Vallesi, Ceppe Cantarelli, Massimo Varini Trio, Lisa, Hope Music Group and Anna Tatangelo.\nFor the first time some social assistance projects were included in the Youth Festival, to allow young pilgrims to spend a few hours of their time at the service of the most needy and forge new bonds of solidarity with the community that hosted them.\n\nThe Pope arrived in Toronto on Thursday, July 25, and was welcomed with a welcome event at the Exhibition Park.\n\nCatecheses continued by following the theme:\n\n\"You are the light of the world\" (Mt 5:14).\n\nIn the evening the Youth Festival continued. In the meantime the Duc reconciliation service continued in Altum Park.\n\nDuring the day the catecheses ended by following the theme:\n\n\"Let yourselves be reconciled with God\" (2Co 5,20).\n\nIn the evening, the stations of the cross was held at University Avenue, one of Downtown Toronto's main arteries.

On the former military airfield, Pope John Paul II early in the morning celebrated the final Holy Mass Holy Mass. The number of participants reaches 800,000 persons.\n\nAs part of the final event, the Pope announced that the next International World Youth Day 2005 will take place in Cologne. In an appeal, he then turned to the German-speaking youth:\n\n\"Dear young German! It is especially important to you to keep alive the spirit of World Youth Day in view of the meeting in Cologne in 2005. Join in a civilization of love and justice! Be yourself a shining example that leads many others to the kingdom of Christ, the kingdom of truth, justice and peace. \"\n\nPope John Paul II\n\nIt was also Pope John Paul II's last World Youth day.\n\nWorld Youth Day 2002 solidified \"Days of the Diocese\", held in various dioceses - with the majority in Montreal, Quebec and London, Ontario - as a major component leading up to the actual WYD Celebrations.\n\nThe scale is massive: Days of the Diocese involved the participation of 35 of Canada's 72 dioceses.
