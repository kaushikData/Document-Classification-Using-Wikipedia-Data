Although the helicopter's loss was initially blamed on enemy action, a subsequent inquiry found \"Cardiff\"s missile to be the cause.\n\nOn the night of 5 June, HMS \"Cardiff\" was stationed to the east of the islands to provide gunfire support to the land forces and intercept enemy aircraft. At around 02:00 a radar contact was detected; a British Army Air Corps Gazelle helicopter was making a routine delivery of personnel and equipment to a radio rebroadcast station on East Falkland. From the contact's speed and course, \"Cardiff\"s operations room crew assumed it to be hostile. One Sea Dart missile was fired, destroying the target. The Gazelle's wreckage and crew were discovered the next morning, and the loss was attributed to enemy fire. Although \"Cardiff\" was suspected, later scientific tests on the wreckage proved inconclusive.\n\nNo formal inquiry was held until four years later. Defending their claim that the helicopter had been lost in action, the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (MoD) stated that they had not wanted to \"cause further anguish to relatives\" while they were still trying to ascertain how the Gazelle had been shot down. The board of inquiry finally confirmed that the soldiers fell due to friendly fire. It recommended that \"neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual\", but identified several factors. A lack of communication between the army and the navy meant that 5th Infantry Brigade had not notified anyone of the helicopter's flight. The navy had not informed the land forces that \"Cardiff\" had changed position to set up an ambush for Argentine aircraft travelling over the area. The helicopter's identification friend or foe (IFF) transmitter was turned off, because it caused interference with the army's Rapier anti-aircraft missile system. The board of inquiry's findings prompted criticism of the MoD's initial response to the incident.\n\nOn 2 April 1982, the British overseas territory of the Falkland Islands was invaded by neighbouring Argentina. The United Kingdom, nearly away, assembled and dispatched a naval task force of 28,000 troops to recapture the islands. The conflict ended that June with the surrender of the Argentine forces; the battles fought on land, at sea, and in the air had cost the lives of some 900 British and Argentine servicemen.\n\nIn early May, British troops landed at San Carlos on the western side of East Falkland, and from there moved overland towards the islands' capital of Stanley. To support the advance, logistical supplies were ferried to the troops by helicopter from San Carlos. The Argentine forces occupying Stanley were supplied throughout the war by C-130 Hercules aircraft from the Argentine mainland. These \"milk-runs\", as the British termed them, were a source of concern to the Royal Navy, and various attempts were made to intercept them.\n\nOn the night of 5 June, the British Type 42 destroyer took up station on the \"Bluff Cove Gunline\" to the east of the islands. Tasked with a dual mission, \"Cardiff\" was to provide fire support to the Royal Marines of 3 Commando Brigade, and to interdict any Argentine aircraft attempting to fly into Stanley. The destroyer had performed a similar role four nights previously, when she unsuccessfully attempted to shoot down a re-supply aircraft as it landed, and again as it took off.<ref name=\"L/Cpl. S. J. Cockton\"></ref>\n\nMeanwhile, pilots Staff Sergeant Christopher Griffin and Lance Corporal Simon Cockton, of 656 Squadron Army Air Corps, had been ordered to fly equipment and personnel to a malfunctioning radio re-broadcast station on top of Pleasant Peak. The station had been established the previous day to provide a communications link between the 5th Infantry Brigade headquarters at Darwin, and the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment at Fitzroy. Night flying conditions were excellent, with a clear sky, a prominent moon and a wind speed of . The crew departed from Goose Green in Gazelle serial number \"XX377\" and collected the replacement equipment from the headquarters at Darwin. They also took on board two passengers; Major Michael Forge, the OC of 205 Signal Squadron, and A Tp Staff Sergeant, Staff Sergeant John Baker. Griffin was an experienced pilot; the flight to the re-broadcast station was expected to take ten minutes.\n\nAt 02:00 local time, \"Cardiff\"s operations room detected \"XX377\" on her surface plot radar at a range of . The helicopter's identification friend or foe (IFF) system was turned off, so receiving no friendly transmissions and with the contact apparently heading towards Stanley, the operations room crew assumed it to be hostile. After calculating its speed they believed they were tracking an Argentine fixed-wing aircraft—either a Hercules conducting a resupply mission, or a FMA IA 58 Pucará ground-attack aircraft sent to retaliate for \"Cardiff\"s shelling. \"Cardiff\" fired one of her Sea Dart missiles. 5th Infantry Brigade lost radio contact with the Gazelle, and simultaneously the exploding missile was seen and heard by the re-broadcast station's personnel atop Pleasant Peak. \"Cardiff\"s crew were able to see the fireball, but only with the aid of night vision goggles.\n\nThe helicopter's loss caused the British to suspect that Argentine forces were still operating in the area, so patrols were mounted by Gurkha soldiers. When the Gurkhas came across the personnel manning the Pleasant Peak station there was potential for another friendly fire incident to occur. At first light a proper search was carried out, and the Gazelle's wreckage was found along with the dead aircrew and passengers; 5th Infantry Brigade's first casualties of the war. Immediately there were suspicions that \"Cardiff\" had been responsible for the shootdown, and later that evening Rear Admiral \"Sandy\" Woodward declared a \"Weapons Tight\" order, forbidding the engagement of any aircraft not positively identified as hostile, for all contacts detected flying over East Falkland at less than and under .\n\nThe crew's bodies were initially examined by senior medical officer, Surgeon-Captain Richard \"Rick\" Jolly of the Royal Navy. The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British were unable to determine if it had been destroyed by \"Cardiff\"s missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and \"XX377\" was declared \"lost in action\". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle might have been lost to friendly fire, it would add to their grief. After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at RAE Farnborough for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found \"several hundred yards\" away from the wreckage.\n\nIn December 1982 an inquest was held by a Southampton coroner into the death of Lance Corporal Cockton after his body was repatriated to the UK. Based on RAE Farnborough's test results, the Army Air Corps submitted evidence stating that the analysis of the warhead fragments found in the wreckage indicated that the helicopter had been destroyed by a type of anti-aircraft missile \"known to have been in the possession of the enemy\". The test results were reviewed in November 1985 and determined that there could be \"no definitive conclusion as to the exact source of the missile fragments recovered from the crash site\". In June 1986, John Stanley, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, announced in his written answers to the House of Commons: \"the [Southampton] coroner has been informed accordingly.\"\nIn October 1986, partly due to pressure from Cockton's mother and the anti-war politician Tam Dalyell, an official board of inquiry was finally opened. The board took a month to reach the conclusion that \"XX377\" was shot down by \"Cardiff\". Historian Hugh Bicheno remarks: \"It took [the] MoD four years and two investigations, the first either incompetent or a deliberate cover-up, even to admit the Gazelle blue-on-blue.\" The board's findings were made public by a Freedom of Information Act request in July 2008, although Paragraph 13 of the report was redacted under Section 26 of the act as it \"contains operational details of the Royal Navy's activities, which, even with the passage of time since the Falklands campaign, would be of use to potential enemies.\"\n\nThe board of inquiry found that standard operating procedure dictated that the commanders of 5th Infantry Brigade were not required to declare the helicopter's mission to any other authority, as the flight was to occur in brigade airspace on a brigade task. Gazelle \"XX377\" was equipped with an IFF transmitter, but this was turned off. In the opinion of the board, \"had IFF been in use there is little doubt that Cardiff would not have engaged the aircraft that night.\" At the time, less than half of the land force's helicopters were fitted with IFF transmitters, and those that were had been ordered not to use them because they inhibited the tracking systems of the British ground-based Rapier anti-aircraft missile batteries. A misconception about the Royal Navy's ability to engage air targets over land led to the navy not being informed that the army's helicopters were not using IFF. The board of inquiry concluded that it was this failure to communicate, together with the navy's assumption that all helicopters would be operating IFF, which \"had a cumulative effect [and] was a major cause of [the] accident.\" However, the board recommended that \"neither negligence nor blame should be attributed to any individual\".\n\nGiven that the role of helicopters in land force operations was increasing, as was the integration of guided missile destroyers for coastal defence, the board of inquiry recommended an amendment to NATO procedures for amphibious warfare and naval gunfire support, to alert other armed forces to the danger of underestimating a ship's missile engagement zone over land. During the late 1980s, the British government placed more emphasis on joint warfare training, with exercises, such as Purple Warrior, taking place in Oman and Scotland. The board noted the establishment of the Permanent Joint Headquarters, designed to put an end to the \"ad hoc and reactive way\" in which operations had been carried out while under single service control. IFF transmitters were fitted to all Army Air Corps and Royal Marine Gazelle and Lynx helicopters, and the problem of operating IFF in the vicinity of Rapier batteries was successfully addressed. The board supported a recommendation that the responsibilities of naval gunfire-support liaison officers could be broadened to include the interpretation of air defence problems during inshore joint warfare operations.\n\nA memorial cross was installed on Pleasant Peak, and the number \"205\" was painted at the crash site by the soldiers of 205 Signal Squadron. The number is approximately wide and can be seen from the air ().\n\n"}

This request by Arturo Navarro, an ex-Comité employee, resulted in a grant of seven thousand dollars, and APSI was born.\n\nAPSI was published on a weekly basis. Due to the climate of censorship in Chile the magazine focused initially on international news. \"APSI\" was published with support of the Popular Unitary Action Movement until late 1978.

The pit area was normally surrounded by a high fence, above which the spectators would look down on the bears.\n\nThe most traditional form of maintaining bears in captivity is keeping them in pits, although many zoos replaced these by more elaborate and spacious enclosures that attempt to replicate their natural habitats, for the benefit of the animals and the visitors.\n\nA noteworthy example is found in Bern, Switzerland. Known as the \"Bärengraben\", it was built in 1857 and is still in use though much modified.\n\nAnother meaning is for an unusually aggressive political arena, in which direct, heated attacks are common.\n\nA bear pit also refers to a type of trap used to deter or trap bears. It usually consists of a large earthen pit with sharpened pikes in the bottom to impale the bear. They are most often used to deter bears from approaching a cabin, rather than as a means of actually catching them.\n\nThe term \"bear pit\" is also used to describe a tournament or sparring format sometimes also referred to as \"king of the hill\". The participants form a queue behind the first two to compete. Once each match is over, the winner remains to face the next opponent in line while the loser goes to the end of the queue. For tournaments, it is usual that the process is continued for a set period of time during which the victor of each match is noted. At the end of the tournament the winner is determined to be the contestant that won the most matches. Multiple bear pits may also be employed, with defeated contestants able to choose which queue to re-enter.\n\nIn Scotland, the phrase \"Bear pit\" is used to describe bars or public houses that are known to have a violent reputation.\n\n\n"}

Its most important association was with the Williams-Wynn family, which extended for around 200 years from 1690. It is now a Grade II* Listed Building and is open to the public as a historic house museum.\n\nThe castle was bought from the Humphreys by Sir William Williams, Speaker in the House of Commons from 1680–1681.\n\nFurther refurbishment work was carried out in the 1880s by Sir Herbert, 7th Baronet, who inherited Bodelwyddan Castle from his heirless cousin.By the First World War the house had become a recuperation hospital for wounded soldiers. During this time, the grounds of the estate were used by soldiers based at the nearby Kinmel Camp for trench warfare training. Traces of these trenches can still be seen.\n\nBy 1920, the cost of maintaining the castle and estate had grown too burdensome, and the Williams-Wynn family leased Bodelwyddan to Lowther College, a girls private school. The school was formed in 1896 at Lytham St. Annes in Lancashire, by Mrs Florence Morris (later Lindley). Lowther College purchased the property five years later, in 1925. The school is thought to be one of the first private schools for girls to have its own swimming pool. It also had a private golf course. The Lowther College Tableaux were well regarded within the community for their musical excellence. Boys were admitted from 1977. The school closed in 1982 due to financial problems.\n\nIn the 1980s, the site was bought by Clwyd County Council with the aim of developing the castle as a visitor attraction. Partnerships were formed with the National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Academy of Arts, so that the castle could be used to display objects from these collections. In order to house these items, the interior of the castle was restored by Roderick Gradidge, an expert on Victorian architecture. Part of the site was leased to the Rank Organisation in 1994 for development into a luxury hotel, Bodelwyddan Castle Hotel, and is now run by Warners, who are part of the Bourne Leisure. The historic house and grounds are not part of the hotel but are managed by Bodelwyddan Castle Trust, an independent registered charity, and are open to the public.\n\nThe castle's association with the National Portrait Gallery came to an end in 2017 after its funding was cut by Denbighshire County Council.\n\nThe castle is set within a large area of parkland, and formal gardens, the most recent of which was originally designed by Thomas Hayton Mawson in 1910.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39618510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39618510", "title": "Boundless Informant", "text": "Boundless Informant\n\nBoundless Informant (stylized as BOUNDLESSINFORMANT) is a big data analysis and data visualization tool used by the United States National Security Agency (NSA). It gives NSA managers summaries of the NSA's worldwide data collection activities by counting metadata. The existence of this tool was disclosed by documents leaked by Edward Snowden, who worked at the NSA for the defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton. Those disclosed documents were in a direct contradiction to the NSA's assurance to United States Congress that it does not collect any type of data on millions of Americans.\n\nIntelligence gathered by the United States government inside the United States or specifically targeting US citizens is legally required to be gathered in compliance with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) and under the authority of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court).\n\nNSA global data mining projects have existed for decades, but recent programs of intelligence gathering and analysis that include data gathered from inside the United States such as PRISM were enabled by changes to US surveillance law introduced under President Bush and renewed under President Obama in December 2012.\n\nBoundless Informant was first publicly revealed on June 8, 2013, after classified documents about the program were leaked to \"The Guardian\". This report contained a Top Secret heat map produced by the Boundless Informant program summarizing data records from 504 separate DNR and DNI collection sources or SIGADs. In the map, countries that are under surveillance are assigned a color from green to red (which does not correspond to intensity of surveillance).\n\nAs this map shows that almost 3 billion data elements from inside the United States were captured by the NSA over a 30-day period ending in March 2013, Snowden stated that this tool was collecting more information on Americans located within the United States than on Russians in Russia. Snowden stated that he raised concerns with two superiors in the Hawaii regional base of the NSA Threat Operations Center and two superiors in the Technology Directorate of the NSA beginning in October 2012, and therefore that counted as using internal dissent channels in the NSA.\n\nSnowden added that coworkers often were \"astonished to learn\" about this detail and did not wish to know any more about the program, and that until April 2012 he often asked these colleagues \"What do you think the public would do if this was on the front page?\" Vanee Vines, an NSA spokesperson, stated that \"After extensive investigation, including interviews with his former NSA supervisors and co-workers, we have not found any evidence to support Mr. Snowden's contention that he brought these matters to anyone's attention.\"\n\nThe first publication about Boundless Informant was followed by screenshots from this program showing charts with details about the data that NSA allegedly collected from several European countries between December 10, 2012 and January 8, 2013. These charts were published by a major news outlet from each of these countries:\n\nInitially, these media wrote that the BoundlessInformant charts showed how much phonecalls NSA intercepted from a particular country. A first correction of this interpretation is that the program doesn't count the content of phone calls, but only the metadata thereof (see below).\n\nA second correction is about by whom and where these data were collected. On August 5, a week after the publication of a chart from BoundlessInformant in Germany, the German intelligence agency BND said that they collected these data from foreign communications, related to military operations abroad. A similar statement was made by the Norwegian military intelligence service, after a chart about Norway was published on November 19. On February 4, 2014, the Dutch government revealed that the 1.8 million metadata in the chart about the Netherlands were not collected by NSA, but instead by the Dutch military intelligence service MIVD, also to support military operations, which almost led to the resignation of the Dutch interior minister.\n\nOn October 29, 2013, NSA-director Keith B. Alexander declared that accusations in French, Spanish and Italian media about NSA intercepting millions of phone calls from these countries are \"completely false\". He added that \"This is not information that we collected on European citizens. It represents information that we and our NATO allies have collected in defense of our countries and in support of military operations.\"\n\nAlthough the initial reports in European media stated that the various charts presented the numbers of phone calls intercepted by NSA, a powerpoint presentation and a FAQ document published by \"The Guardian\" say that BoundlessInformant is counting and analysing DNI (internet) and DNR (telephony) metadata records passing through the NSA's signals intelligence systems, and are therefore not showing how much content of internet and telephone communications is intercepted.\n\nData analyzed by Boundless Informant includes electronic surveillance program records and telephone call metadata records stored in an NSA data archive called GM-PLACE. It does not include FISA data, according to the FAQ memo. PRISM, a government codename for a collection effort known officially as US-984XN, which was revealed at the same time as Boundless Informant, is one source of DNR data.\n\nAccording to published slides, Boundless Informant leverages Free and Open Source Software—and is therefore \"available to all NSA developers\"—and corporate services hosted in the cloud. The tool uses HDFS, MapReduce, and Accumulo (formerly Cloudbase) for data processing.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "53073278", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=53073278", "title": "Bowling Green massacre", "text": "Bowling Green massacre\n\nThe Bowling Green massacre is a fictitious incident alluded to by U.S. Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway in interviews with \"Cosmopolitan\" and TMZ on January 29, 2017 and in an interview on the MSNBC news program \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\" on February 2, 2017. Conway cited it as justification for a travel and immigration ban from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by United States President Donald Trump. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on charges including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al-Qaeda in Iraq\". She stated that she had mentioned the incident because it led President Barack Obama to tighten immigration procedures for Iraqi citizens.\n\nHer false statement went viral and became the top trending topic on Twitter, with many tweets parodying it. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for supposed victims. Facebook users used the site's safety check feature to act as if the event were real. Mock vigils were held in Kentucky and New York in commemoration. It provoked widespread press reaction, with many relating it to Conway's earlier use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" to describe false statements by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer in the wake of the inauguration of Donald Trump.\n\nIn 2011, two Iraqi men who had entered the country as refugees were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on federal terrorism charges after they attempted to send both money and weapons to al-Qaeda in Iraq. Both were convicted of supporting attacks on the U.S. military while they were still in Iraq as well as attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda in Iraq after they emigrated to the United States. Arrests were made on various charges, including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al Qaeda in Iraq\".\n\nBefore entering the U.S., both had used improvised explosive devices in Iraq, although this was not known at the time of their admission. Both pleaded guilty; one is serving a life sentence while the other is serving 40 years in federal prison. The two did not attack anyone in the U.S., and there was no evidence that the men traveled back to Iraq or had any contact with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant after being admitted to the U.S. Neither was charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.\n\nIn response to the arrests, the administration of Barack Obama re-vetted 58,000 refugees already in the country, imposed vetting on 25,000 other Iraqi citizens still in Iraq, and significantly tightened the processing of Iraqi visa and refugee applications for six months. Obama also instituted a requirement for new background checks on visa applicants from Iraq; as a result, Iraq travel visas were issued more slowly. The changes in visa verification were temporary, and some Iraqi refugees continued to be admitted to the United States throughout the period.\n\nIn September 2014, on \"Fox News Sunday\", U.S. Representative Peter King of New York referred to the 2011 arrest of Iraqi nationals in Kentucky as an attempt to \"attack either Fort Campbell or Fort Knox\". The fact-checking site PolitiFact.com, which evaluated the statement as being false, found that he had said something similar at least seven times previously.\n\nOn January 29–30, 2017, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated that Islamist terrorists perpetrated a terrorist attack in Atlanta, even though Atlanta has never had a terrorist attack carried out by Islamists. The initial comment was made on ABC's \"This Week\", and then Spicer repeated the claim on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" the following day. Spicer later said that he meant Orlando, referring to the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, which was carried out by U.S.–born Omar Mateen. There have been two terrorist attacks in Atlanta: the 1996 Centennial Olympic Park bombing, which was carried by domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph, and the 1958 Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing.\n\nA day later, on January 31, two days before the \"Hardball\" interview with Conway, Kentucky senator Rand Paul referenced the 2011 case in an interview with MSNBC by mentioning \"the possibility or the attempted bombing in Bowling Green, Kentucky, where I live\". \"The Washington Post\" Fact Checker noted that Paul's statement was truer than Conway's because the Iraqi nationals did discuss bombing an Army target in the United States, even though neither was charged with making actual plans to do so.\n\nOn January 29, 2017, in an interview with \"Cosmopolitan\", Conway said that Obama had limited Iraqi immigration because \"two Iraqi nationals came to this country, joined ISIS, traveled back to the Middle East to get trained and refine their terrorism skills, and come back here, and were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre of taking innocent soldiers' lives away\".\n\nOn the same day, in a brief interview with TMZ, Conway stated: \"He did that because, I assume, there were two Iraqis who came here, got radicalized, joined ISIS, and then were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green attack on our brave soldiers.\"\n\nThree days later, on February 2, in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC's \"Hardball with Chris Matthews\", Conway described the \"Bowling Green massacre\" as an attack of terrorism carried out within the United States by refugees. Conway said:\n\nAlthough the interviews with \"Cosmopolitan\" and TMZ were conducted first, they did not become public until after the MSNBC interview aired.\n\nOn February 3, the day after her MSNBC interview, Conway said she misspoke and that she meant to use the term \"Bowling Green terrorists\" instead of \"Bowling Green massacre\", referring to the two Iraqi men arrested in 2011. \"The Washington Post\" subsequently mentioned previous statements by Conway where she had made reference to the nonexistent massacre, indicating that \"she doesn't appear to have misspoken at all\".\n\nConway's statement that the men became \"radicalized\" in the United States was found to be incorrect, as they had been radicalized outside of the country. Conway's statement that President Obama \"had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program\" was misleading, as the Obama administration move was not a formal ban. Contrary to Conway's claims, there is no evidence that the men had traveled back to the Middle East or had any contact with ISIS after being admitted to the United States. Neither of the two was ever charged with plotting attacks inside the United States.\n\nConway, in her February 3 statement, said that there was no coverage of the Bowling Green investigation, which she intended to refer to. However, there were approximately 90 news articles that covered the arrest and charges at the time. Conway's February 3 statement cited an example of that coverage, without acknowledging that her claim that \"it didn't get covered\" was also incorrect.\n\nOn February 5, CNN declined an interview with Conway, partly because of \"serious questions about her credibility\" and partly because CNN could not get Mike Pence, whom the administration made available to all the other major Sunday shows. That day, she said in a text exchange, \"Frankly they were terrorists in Bowling Green but their massacre took place in Iraq.\" Two days later, she was a guest on CNN, interviewed on air by Jake Tapper. In the interview, Conway apologized for repeatedly referencing a \"Bowling Green massacre\" that did not happen.\n\nIn a March 2017 interview with \"New York\", Conway said she intended to say \"Bowling Green masterminds\" rather than \"Bowling Green massacre\", in reference to \"would-be terrorists who were apprehended before they staged an attack\".\n\nThe video clip of Conway's \"massacre\" statement went viral online, with the phrase becoming the top trending topic on Twitter. Some Twitter users wrote that, despite Conway's clarification, substituting \"terrorists\" for \"massacre\" in her statement did not make sense. Her statement was parodied on Twitter and other platforms with people creating fake tributes. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for victims of the imaginary massacre; the donation link on the website goes to the ACLU's donation page. Facebook users mocked the Bowling Green massacre by using Facebook's safety check feature to pretend the event was real. In New York City's Bowling Green, people held a mock vigil to commemorate the \"victims\" of the \"massacre\". Another mock vigil took place on February 3, 2017, in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Responses on the Donald Trump-centric subreddit :/r/The Donald were \"varied – and rather muted\", with some redditors speculating that it was an intentional part of a larger strategy by the Trump administration.\n\nSamantha Schmidt wrote in \"The Washington Post\": \"Conway has taken 'alternative facts' to a new level\". \"The Atlantic\" wrote that her \"false statement stands out because it is simultaneously inaccurate and has the potential to be extremely inflammatory\". Brian Stelter on CNN criticized the Trump administration for \"hammering\" the media for mistakes but going easy on Conway's error. British journalist Marina Hyde wrote a column in \"The Guardian\" criticizing the Trump administration for creating a fictional massacre when it was silent on the Quebec City mosque shooting. UK talk show \"The Last Leg's\" Alex Brooker commented: \"Are there so few shootings in America that they're having to make them up?\" \"Cosmopolitan\" reporter Kristen Mascia said: \"It didn't surprise me that the comment was premeditated and that she'd tried it on multiple writers (who knows who else she auditioned it with, frankly). But others out there may not know this about her, and they should. We must call out the [White House] for stuff like this because it's egregious and totally unacceptable.\" After Chelsea Clinton posted a tweet that stated, in part: \"Please don't make up attacks\", Conway replied: \"Bosnia lie a Great reminder\", referring to how Clinton's mother Hillary Clinton falsely claimed to have landed in Bosnia \"under sniper fire\" during the Bosnian War.\n\nWriting in \"The New York Times\", A.C Thompson mentioned the 2012 case of a man who the authorities suspected of trafficking in counterfeit goods. His home and his store in Bowling Green, Ohio, were raided, and 18 firearms were found in his possession. Federal authorities believed that he was planning on killing African Americans and Jews. The man, who the prosecutors called a white supremacist, pleaded guilty to weapons and counterfeit charges, but prosecutors failed to establish that he was a political terrorist.\n\nThe mayor of Bowling Green, Kentucky, issued a statement clarifying that \"there was no massacre in Bowling Green\", adding that he understood \"how during a live interview one can misspeak and we appreciate the clarification\".\n\nConway's statement was parodied in two segments of season 42 of \"Saturday Night Live\". In the cold open for that season's episode 13, Alec Baldwin, playing the role of Donald Trump, said that in the Bowling Green massacre, \"[s]o many people died, but really they're the lucky ones. They don't have to see how bad \"The Apprentice\" has gotten\". In episode 14's cold open, Melissa McCarthy, playing the role of Sean Spicer, recited a list of terrorist incidents that \"you [the news media] never even write about\", referencing a list of 78 supposedly under-reported terrorist incidents that the White House had released earlier that week. McCarthy, as Spicer, said: \"The Bowling Green massacre—not the Kellyanne one, the real one. The Horror in Six Flags. The Slaughter at Fraggle Rock. The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down. Okay?!\"\n\n"}

Should the stone later be removed, the relics may be found. Though this tradition is still practiced, such memorials are deposited in the hope that they will never be disturbed.\n\nLiving victims were once entombed as \"a sacrifice to the gods\" and to ensure the stability of the building.\n\nGrimm remarked \"It was often thought necessary to immure live animals and even men in the foundation, on which the structure was to be raised, to secure immovable stability.\" This gruesome practice is well evidenced, in multiple cultures. \"The old pagan laid the foundation of his house and fortress in blood.\" Under the walls of two round towers in Ireland (the only ones examined) human skeletons were discovered. In the 15th century, the wall of Holsworthy church was built over a living human being, and when this became unlawful, images of living beings were substituted.\n\nReferences to this practice can be found in Greek folk culture in a poem about \"Arta's bridge\". According to the poem, the wife of the chief builder was sacrificed to establish a good foundation for a bridge that was of grave importance to the secluded city of Arta. The actual bridge was constructed in 1602. A similar legend appears in the Romanian folk poem Meșterul Manole, about the building of the church in the earliest Wallachian capital city.\n\n"}

It was associated with Emcee Africa - The Battle Chronicles, a talent show televising the competition. It was a continent-wide search for the premier freestyle MC/Rapper. The tour started in Accra, Ghana, and then went through Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, Nairobi, Kenya, Luanda, Angola, Lagos, Nigeria and Johannesburg, South Africa. Gaborone, Botswana was included in the second season, while Luanda, Angola and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania were cut from the tour.\n\nThe motive of the tour was not only to find the best freestyle MC, but to initiate international awareness of the 'street life' surrounding social and cultural context of the localized music. In other words, the tour was attempting to better contextualize the application and reception of hip hop culture in each visited country.\n\nThe winner received $10,000, a video and a song deal.\n\nThe first season of \"Emcee Africa\" followed the host Leslie 'Lee' Kasumba to the various host cities, where the local MC/Rapper's were invited to an audition. The final eight MC's were selected to face off in a knockout competition to determine the winner. During the auditions, each performer had two minutes to prove their candidacy for the final eight to a panel of judges. A topic was given to each contender to Freestyle about in order to ensure each contestant was truly improvising and not using any written material. After eight contestants were selected from each country, a separate contest was held, where the eight members would face off to battle each other in two 30 second parts, divided into 2 rounds, followed by the Final. The winner from each country was then flown into Johannesburg to compete for the \"Emcee Africa\" title, as well as the grand prize. A judge from each country's panel was then flown in to ensure neutrality in the final competition.\n\nThe second season followed a similar format with similar rules, except that ten contenders were selected from the auditions, rather than eight. In the second season, contestants who made it through to the second round did not Battle each other but were rather judged based on a performance. From the performance, the judges panel selected two finalists to face off in a final battle.\n\nFor the Final Battle in the first season, audiences could log into www.channelo.co.za, and vote for their favorite MC/Rapper from the previous competitions, to reappear in the final stages.\n\nLeslie 'Lee' Kasumba (a top hip hop radio DJ from South Africa's YFM station) is the host. She also corresponds for Africanhiphop.com.\n\nOn the tour called 'the Battle Chronicles', she was chosen to narrate her daily experiences of traveling.\n\n\"Never before has a continental Hip Hop

{"id": "38668379", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38668379", "title": "Charlie Wilson (criminal)", "text": "Charlie Wilson (criminal)\n\nCharles Frederick \"Charlie\" Wilson (30 June 1932 – 23 April 1990) was an English career criminal. A member of the Great Train Robbery gang, of which he was treasurer, he was killed by a hitman on a bicycle in 1990 whilst living in Marbella, Spain.\n\nWilson was born on 30 June 1932 to Bill and Mabel Wilson in Battersea, London. Possessing a heavy build, a handsome appearance and piercing blue eyes, Wilson was, from an early age, an intimidating presence. His friends from childhood included Jimmy Hussey, Tommy Wisbey, Bruce Reynolds and Gordon Goody. Later on, he met Ronald \"Buster\" Edwards and the young driving enthusiasts Mickey Ball and Roy James, who had taken up car theft.\n\nFrom 1948 to 1950 he was called up for National Service, and in 1955 he married Patricia (Pat) Osbourne, with whom he had three children.\n\nWilson turned to crime early in life and spurned his father's legitimate but low-income wage. While he did have legitimate work in his in-laws' grocer's shop, he also was a thief and his criminal proceeds went into buying shares in various gambling enterprises. He went to jail for short spells for numerous offences.\n\nIn 1960, Wilson began to work with Bruce Reynolds and planned to get into the criminal big league. In 1962, a gang led by Reynolds stole £62,000 in a security van robbery at London Heathrow Airport. They then attempted to rob a Royal Mail train at Swindon, which netted only £700. But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment, started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months.\n\nReynolds organised a gang of 17 men to undertake the Great Train Robbery (1963). Wilson was the gang's treasurer who gave each of the robbers their cut of the haul: £150,000 each. He was captured quickly, and during the trial at Aylesbury Crown Court in April 1964 he got the nickname \"the silent man\" as he refused to say anything at all. Sentenced to 30 years, he was held at HMP Winson Green, where after just four months on 12 August 1964, he arranged for a three-man gang to break-in and break him out.\n\nWilson and his family settled in Rigaud, Quebec, Canada, situated west from Montreal and east from Ottawa. For Christmas 1964, the family travelled to Acapulco to join Reynolds and Edwards, who had not yet been caught. Reynolds and his family later moved to Montreal, but a proposed theft of Canadian dollars with Wilson was stopped due to Royal Canadian Mounted Police observation. Reynolds then moved to Vancouver, before returning that summer to the South of France.\n\nHaving successfully evaded capture for four years, Wilson was caught on 24 January 1968, after his wife telephoned her parents in England, thus enabling Scotland Yard to track them down. Returned to England, Wilson served 10 more years in the train robbers secure unit at HMP Durham. He was the final train robber to emerge from prison in 1978.\n\nA later suspect in a £100 million gold fraud, Wilson moved to Marbella, Spain, where he was suspected to be involved in drug smuggling. Engaged to launder some of the proceeds from the Brink's-Mat robbery, he lost the investors £3 million.\n\nOn 23 April 1990, Wilson's cousin and his wife who were staying with the Wilsons, left the house, noticing a young man with badly dyed spiky blond hair sunning himself beside his yellow bicycle on a nearby roundabout. The same man knocked on the front door of Wilson's hacienda north of Marbella, and when Pat Wilson opened the door, he asked (in a London accent) to speak to Wilson, as he had a message from Eamon, a baseball cap pulled down shielding his eyes from view. Pat got him to leave the bike near the front door, and let him go out the back yard to talk to Wilson who was preparing a barbecue dinner to celebrate his and Pat's wedding anniversary.\n\nAfter five minutes of conversation, the visitor kicked Wilson in the groin, broke his nose, and shot him twice, once in the neck and the other in the head. One of Wilson's two guard dogs sustained a broken leg trying to defend its master (it later had to be put down). The killer then jumped over the back fence in the one spot where it was possible to do and land on the ground outside safely, and circled back to the front of the house to grab the yellow bike. An accomplice pulled up in a van nearby and the killer was able to put the bike in the back and escape. The whole hit was expertly designed to take out Wilson alone, and leave his wife alive. \n\nCharlie's wife Pat, moved back to London to live near her daughters, leaving her terrier with Gordon Goody, and her surviving guard dog with the neighbour. \n\nIt is likely that Wilson was murdered on the orders of Roy \"The Lump\" Adkins, with killers identified by Pat Wilson as Bill \"Porky\" Edmunds, with Danny \"Scarface\" Roff as the accomplice. The two men were known to work as a team. Adkins was furious with Wilson, that he had supposedly given 'permission' for smuggler Jimmy Rose to admit to police that a drug shipment he was carrying was owned by Adkins, who was already on the run from police. After a request from Rose, Wilson rung one of Adkins' associates, Eamon Evans, to ask whether Rose could name him. While Rose denies naming Adkins, two days after Wilson's call to Evans, police raided Adkins hideout in Amsterdam, only shortly after he had left it. Adkins, a heavy drug user as well as dealer was furious with Wilson, and would not agree to peaceful terms arranged by intermediaries. Whether or not the three men were guilty, they were widely held responsible and Adkins was himself gunned down on 28 September 1990. On 10 February 1996, Danny 'Scarface' Roff who had recently been released from prison was shot in the spine when a gunman walked into a club where he was present and sprayed him with bullets. In March 1997, a crippled Roff, now no longer able to walk, was shot dead in his car when he returned home. Edmunds has survived by going on the run.\n\n \n"}

It took place at Forum, Copenhagen on 22 October 2005. The host broadcaster was Danmarks Radio (DR). Fourteen songs from the Contest's first half-century, chosen through an internet poll and by a jury, contested the event. Thirty-one EBU-member countries broadcast the concert (although notably the United Kingdom, Italy and France did not) and televoting and juries in these countries decided the winner. A total of 2.5 million votes were cast during the night.\n\nThe event was hosted by Katrina Leskanich and Renārs Kaupers. The event was won by Swedish group ABBA, performing \"Waterloo\"; the band had originally won the Contest for Sweden in 1974.\n\nTo coincide with the event, the EBU released two double album CDs featuring Eurovision songs from the previous fifty years. Two DVDs with original Eurovision performances of these songs were also released.\n\nIn November 2002, Jürgen Meier-Beer from the Reference Group of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced plans to organize a special jubilee concert in 2005 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nIn June 2004, the EBU announced that it was to hold a concert to celebrate fifty years of the contest. The event was to be held on 16 October 2005 at the Royal Albert Hall in London, England. The BBC was to be the host broadcaster for the concert. The Royal Albert Hall was reportedly unavailable, so in August 2004 the EBU announced that DR would stage the event instead. Eurovision Song Contest supervisor Svante Stockselius said that Denmark's previous experience of hosting Eurovision events (the 2001 Contest and the first Junior Eurovision Song Contest in 2003) were influential in the Union's choice. The event was codenamed \"Extravaganza\". 1998 Eurovision winner Dana International, who appeared at the event, later went to suggest that the reason behind the change of host country was also due to the fact that the BBC wanted to present the show \"with humour\" as though to poke fun at the Contest, an idea that proved to be less popular with the EBU. The BBC went on to broadcast their own 50th anniversary program, \"\", in May 2006.\n\nOn 25 October 2004 Copenhagen was confirmed as the host city for the event, which was now scheduled to take place on 22 October 2005. In May 2005 \"Congratulations\" was confirmed as the official name of the concert. A month later DR announced that Forum Copenhagen would host the programme. The chosen venue had previously hosted the first junior edition of the Eurovision Song Contest in 2003.\n\nOn 9 September 2005, DR announced that Katrina Leskanich and Renārs Kaupers would present the concert. Leskanich was the lead singer of Katrina and The Waves, who won the Contest for the United Kingdom in . Kaupers is the lead singer of Latvian group Brainstorm, who represented Latvia on its debut in the Contest in . Tickets for the event went on sale on 22 August 2005 from 10:00 (CET) and sold out in just over one hour. The event was attended by an audience of 6,000.\n\nFourteen songs would compete in \"Congratulations\". In May 2005 the EBU opened a poll on its website to decide ten songs that would contest the event. Voters chose their two favourite songs from each of five decades: 1956 to 1965, 1966 to 1975, 1976 to 1985, 1986 to 1995 and 1996 to 2005. The remaining four songs would be selected by the EBU's Reference Group. On 16 June 2005 the fourteen chosen songs were announced, although no indication was given as to which had been chosen online and which by the Reference Group. Eleven of the fourteen songs were Eurovision winners; only \"Nel blu di pinto di blu\", \"Congratulations\" and \"Eres Tú\" (which all finished in the top three at the Contest) were not. Two countries, the United Kingdom and Ireland, were represented twice on the list. Johnny Logan, who won the Contest twice for Ireland as a singer, had both of his songs featured on the list.\n\nAll 31 countries broadcasting the contest voted in the first round. The five songs that are marked in orange qualified to the second and final round.\n\nAll 31 countries broadcasting the contest voted in the second round.\n\nThe show started with the traditional Eurovision \"Te Deum\" theme followed by a message from Cliff Richard. After a quick montage of all 14 songs, the orchestra began playing \"Ding-A-Dong\" (Netherlands 1975), with dancers on stage. \"A-Ba-Ni-Bi\" (Israel 1978), \"Le dernier qui a parlé...\" (France 1991), and \"Dschinghis Khan\" (Germany 1979) was also played and accompanied by choreography, which was then followed by \"Love Shine a Light\" (UK 1997) sung by the co-host, Katrina Leskanich, who came out with flag holders of all the nations who ever participated in Eurovision.\n\nThroughout the telecast, a number of highlights segments were presented which showed montages of various Eurovision performances which were either interesting, notable or unorthodox. There were 6 assortments, which were under the categories described by the hosts as 'past winners', 'political, daring, larger than life', 'cute men', 'unforgettable interpretation of dance', 'girlpower' and 'close/narrow second-place finishers'. A number of high-profile Eurovision artists returned to help introduce and present the show, these were: Carola Häggkvist, Massiel, Dana International, Birthe Wilke, Anne-Marie David, Sandra Kim, Elisabeth Andreassen, Hanne Krogh, Olsen Brothers, Emilija Kokić, Marie Myriam, Sertab Erener, Elena Paparizou, Nicole & Hugo, Cheryl Baker and Lys Assia. Cliff Richard and Nicole gave pre-recorded messages as they were unable to attend.\n\nDuring the show, there were many presentations by various guest artists during the voting and tallying period. These consisted of the Finnish shouting choir Mieskuoro Huutajat, Riverdance (the 1994 interval act), Ronan Keating (the 1997 co-host), and Johnny Logan, singing his new single \"When a Woman Loves a Man\", as well as an appearance by the Belgian duo of 1973, Nicole & Hugo.\n\nThere were three medleys, consisting of performances of past Eurovision songs. The first consisted of : Dana International, singing \"Parlez-vous Francais\" (originally performed by Baccara for Luxembourg in Eurovision Song Contest 1978); Carola Haggkvist, singing \"Främling\" (1983, 3rd place); Alsou, singing \"Solo\" (2000, 2nd); Fabrizio Faniello, singing \"Another Summer Night\" (2001 9th); Marie Myriam, singing \"L'Amour est bleu\" (originally performed by Vicky Leandros for Luxembourg in 1967); Richard Herrey, singing \"Let Me Be the One\" (originally performed by The Shadows for United Kingdom in 1975); and Thomas Thordarson, singing \" Vi Maler Byen Rød\" (originally performed by Birthe Kjær for Denmark in 1989).\n\nThe second consisted of: Gali Atari, singing \"Hallelujah\" (1979, winner); Bobbysocks, singing \"La Det Swinge\" (1985, winner); Anne-Marie David, singing \"Après Toi\" (originally sung by Vicky Leandros for Luxembourg in 1972, winner); Lys Assia, singing \"Refrain\" (1956, winner), Sandra Kim singing \"Non ho l'Eta\" (originally sung by Gigliola Cinquetti for Italy in 1964, winner) and Bucks Fizz singing \"Making your Mind Up\" (1981, winner).\n\nThe final medley was sung by Eimear Quinn, Charlie McGettigan, Jakob Sveistrup and Linda Martin, the Eurovision winners of 1996, 1994 and 1992, and (in Sveistrup's case), the 2005 Danish representative. All four acted as backup singers during the show.\n\nBoth juries and televoting were used at \"Congratulations\"; both having an equal influence over the vote. In the first round of voting, the number of songs was reduced to five. Each country awarded points from one to eight, then ten and finally twelve for their ten most popular songs. Unlike in the Contest proper, viewers were allowed to vote for songs which had represented their country. The top five songs were then subjected to another round of voting, where only six points and above were awarded. The voting was conducted in private, and the results were not announced until after the show. The song with the most points in the second round was the winner.\n\nThe full scoreboard is as follows:\n\nBelow is a summary of the maximum 12 points each country awarded in the first round:\nBelow is a summary of the maximum 12 points each country awarded in the second round:\nA total of thirty-four countries broadcast the event, but only thirty-two participated in the voting.\n\nCountries that broadcast the contest live and were allowed to vote were;\n\nCountries that broadcast the contest delayed and therefore lost the right to vote were;\n\nOther countries that broadcast the contest;\n\nCountries that have previously competed but were not involved with the broadcast or voting of the contest;\nThe BBC (UK), RAI (Italy) and France Télévisions chose not to broadcast the event. Søren Therkelsen, the commissioning editor of the event, said he was \"disappointed\" at the broadcasters' decision not to transmit the show. The BBC chose not to carry the event as it was \"too remote\" for British audiences.\n\n The Very Best Of The Eurovision Song Contest (also known as \"Congratulations: 50 Years Of The Eurovision Song Contest\") was the official compilation album for the 50th anniversary, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by CMC International on 21 October 2005. The compiltation featured over 100 songs, including all Eurovision Song Contest winners from 1956 until 2005 and a selection of all-time favourites, that was divided into 2 separate double CDs: 1956–1980 and 1981–2005.

{"id": "38992", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38992", "title": "Cosmological constant", "text": "Cosmological constant\n\nIn cosmology, the cosmological constant (usually denoted by the Greek capital letter lambda: Λ) is the energy density of space, or vacuum energy, that arises in Albert Einstein's field equations of general relativity. It is closely associated to the concepts of dark energy and quintessence. \n\nEinstein originally introduced the concept in 1917 to counterbalance the effects of gravity and achieve a static universe, a notion which was the accepted view at the time. Einstein abandoned the concept in 1931 after Hubble's discovery of the expanding universe. From the 1930s until the late 1990s, most physicists assumed the cosmological constant to be equal to zero. That changed with the surprising discovery in 1998 that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, implying the possibility of a positive nonzero value for the cosmological constant. \n\nSince the 1990s, studies have shown that around 68% of the mass–energy density of the universe can be attributed to so-called dark energy. The cosmological constant Λ is the simplest possible explanation for dark energy, and is used in the current standard model of cosmology known as the ΛCDM model. While dark energy is poorly understood at a fundamental level, the main required properties of dark energy are that it functions as a type of anti-gravity, it dilutes much more slowly than matter as the universe expands, and it clusters much more weakly than matter, or perhaps not at all.\n\nAccording to quantum field theory (QFT) which underlies modern particle physics, empty space is defined by the vacuum state which is a collection of quantum fields. All these quantum fields exhibit fluctuations in their ground state (lowest energy density) arising from the zero-point energy present everywhere in space. These zero-point fluctuations should act as a contribution to the cosmological constant Λ, but when calculations are performed these fluctuations give rise to an enormous vacuum energy. The discrepancy between theorized vacuum energy from QFT and observed vacuum energy from cosmology is a source of major contention, with the values predicted exceeding observation by some 120 orders of magnitude, a discrepancy that has been called \"the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!\". This issue is called the cosmological constant problem and it is one of the greatest unsolved mysteries in science with many physicists believing that \"the vacuum holds the key to a full understanding of nature\".\n\nEinstein included the cosmological constant as a term in his field equations for general relativity because he was dissatisfied that otherwise his equations did not allow, apparently, for a static universe: gravity would cause a universe that was initially at dynamic equilibrium to contract. To counteract this possibility, Einstein added the cosmological constant. However, soon after Einstein developed his static theory, observations by Edwin Hubble indicated that the universe appears to be expanding; this was consistent with a cosmological solution to the \"original\" general relativity equations that had been found by the mathematician Friedmann, working on the Einstein equations of general relativity. Einstein reportedly referred to his failure to accept the validation of his equations—when they had predicted the expansion of the universe in theory, before it was demonstrated in observation of the cosmological red shift—as his \"biggest blunder\".\n\nIn fact, adding the cosmological constant to Einstein's equations does not lead to a static universe at equilibrium because the equilibrium is unstable: if the universe expands slightly, then the expansion releases vacuum energy, which causes yet more expansion. Likewise, a universe that contracts slightly will continue contracting.\n\nHowever, the cosmological constant remained a subject of theoretical and empirical interest. Empirically, the onslaught of cosmological data in the past decades strongly suggests that our universe has a positive cosmological constant. The explanation of this small but positive value is an outstanding theoretical challenge, the so-called cosmological constant problem.\n\nSome early generalizations of Einstein's gravitational theory, known as classical unified field theories, either introduced a cosmological constant on theoretical grounds or found that it arose naturally from the mathematics. For example, Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed that the cosmological constant version of the vacuum field equation expressed the \"epistemological\" property that the universe is \"self-gauging\", and Erwin Schrödinger's pure-affine theory using a simple variational principle produced the field equation with a cosmological term.\n\nThe cosmological constant formula_1 appears in Einstein's field equation in the form\n\nwhere the Ricci tensor/scalar \"R\" and the metric tensor \"g\" describe the structure of spacetime, the stress-energy tensor \"T\" describes the energy and momentum density and flux of the matter in that point in spacetime, and the universal constants \"G\" and \"c\" are conversion factors that arise from using traditional units of measurement. When \"Λ\" is zero, this reduces to the field equation of general relativity usually used in the mid-20th century. When \"T\" is zero, the field equation describes empty space (the vacuum).\n\nThe cosmological constant has the same effect as an intrinsic energy density of the vacuum, \"ρ\" (and an associated pressure). In this context, it is commonly moved onto the right-hand side of the equation, and defined with a proportionality factor of 8\"π\": , where unit conventions of general relativity are used (otherwise factors of \"G\" and \"c\" would also appear, i.e. , where \"κ\" is Einstein's constant). It is common to quote values of energy density directly, though still using the name \"cosmological constant\", with convention . The true dimension of Λ is a length.\n\nGiven the Planck (2018) values of Ω = and H = = , Λ has the value of\n\nor in reduced Planck units or eV in natural units.\n\nA positive vacuum energy density resulting from a cosmological constant implies a negative pressure, and vice versa. If the energy density is positive, the associated negative pressure will drive an accelerated expansion of the universe, as observed. (See dark energy and cosmic inflation for details.)\n\nInstead of the cosmological constant itself, cosmologists often refer to the ratio between the energy density due to the cosmological constant and the critical density of the universe, the tipping point for a sufficient density to stop the universe from expanding forever. This ratio is usually denoted Ω, and is estimated to be , according to results published by the Planck Collaboration in 2018.\n\nIn a flat universe, Ω is the fraction of the energy of the universe due to the cosmological constant, i.e., what we would intuitively call the fraction of the universe that is made up of dark energy. Note that this value changes over time: the critical density changes with cosmological time, but the energy density due to the cosmological constant remains unchanged throughout the history of the universe: the amount of dark energy increases as the universe grows, while the amount of matter does not.\n\nAnother ratio that is used by scientists is the equation of state, usually denoted \"w\", which is the ratio of pressure that dark energy puts on the universe to the energy per unit volume. This ratio is for a true cosmological constant, and is generally different for alternative time-varying forms of vacuum energy such as quintessence. The Planck Collaboration (2018) has measured \"w\" = , consistent with , assuming no evolution in \"w\" over cosmic time.\n\nObservations announced in 1998 of distance–redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae indicated that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. When combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation these implied a value of Ω ≈ 0.7, a result which has been supported and refined by more recent measurements. There are other possible causes of an accelerating universe, such as quintessence, but the cosmological constant is in most respects the simplest solution. Thus, the current standard model of cosmology, the Lambda-CDM model, includes the cosmological constant, which is measured to be on the order of 10m, in metric units. It is often expressed as 10s or 10 in other unit systems. The value is based on recent measurements of vacuum energy density, formula_4, or 10 GeV, 10 g/cm in other unit systems.\n\nAs was only recently seen, by works of 't Hooft, Susskind and others, a positive cosmological constant has surprising consequences, such as a finite maximum entropy of the observable universe (see the holographic principle).\n\nA major outstanding problem is that most quantum field theories predict a huge value for the quantum vacuum. A common assumption is that the quantum vacuum is equivalent to the cosmological constant. Although no theory exists that supports this assumption, arguments can be made in its favor.\n\nSuch arguments are usually based on dimensional analysis and effective field theory. If the universe is described by an effective local quantum field theory down to the Planck scale, then we would expect a cosmological constant of the order of formula_5 (formula_6 in natural unit or formula_7 in reduced Planck unit). As noted above, the measured cosmological constant is smaller than this by a factor of ~10. This discrepancy has been called \"the worst theoretical prediction in the history of physics!\".\n\nSome supersymmetric theories require a cosmological constant that is exactly zero, which further complicates things. This is the cosmological constant problem, the worst problem of fine-tuning in physics: there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in cosmology from particle physics.\n\nOne possible explanation for the small but non-zero value was noted by Steven Weinberg in 1987 following the anthropic principle. Weinberg explains that if the vacuum energy took different values in different domains of the universe, then observers would necessarily measure values similar to that which is observed: the formation of life-supporting structures would be suppressed in domains where the vacuum energy is much larger. Specifically, if the vacuum energy is negative and its absolute value is substantially larger than it appears to be in the observed universe (say, a factor of 10 larger), holding all other variables (e.g. matter density) constant, that would mean that the universe is closed; furthermore, its lifetime would be shorter than the age of our universe, possibly too short for intelligent life to form. On the other hand, a universe with a large positive cosmological constant would expand too fast, preventing galaxy formation. According to Weinberg, domains where the vacuum energy is compatible with life would be comparatively rare. Using this argument, Weinberg predicted that the cosmological constant would have a value of less than a hundred times the currently accepted value. In 1992, Weinberg refined this prediction of the cosmological constant to 5 to 10 times the matter density.\n\nThis argument depends on a lack of a variation of the distribution (spatial or otherwise) in the vacuum energy density, as would be expected if dark energy were the cosmological constant. There is no evidence that the vacuum energy does vary, but it may be the case if, for example, the vacuum energy is (even in part) the potential of a scalar field such as the residual inflaton (also see quintessence). Another theoretical approach that deals with the issue is that of multiverse theories, which predict a large number of \"parallel\" universes with different laws of physics and/or values of fundamental constants. Again, the anthropic principle states that we can only live in one of the universes that is compatible with some form of intelligent life. Critics claim that these theories, when used as an explanation for fine-tuning, commit the inverse gambler's fallacy.\n\nIn 1995, Weinberg's argument was refined by Alexander Vilenkin to predict a value for the cosmological constant that was only ten times the matter density, i.e. about three times the current value since determined.\n\n\n"}

Inclusion in this list does not necessarily imply that anyone involved was guilty of a crime. For accidents or crimes that involved radioactive substances unbeknownst to those involved, see the list of radiation accidents.\n\nAn unnamed man was convicted of attempting to poison his ex-wife in 2001 with plutonium stolen from WAK (Wiederaufbereitungsanlage Karlsruhe), a small scale reprocessing plant where he worked. He did not steal a large amount of plutonium, only rags used for wiping surfaces and a small amount of liquid waste. At least two people (besides the criminal) were contaminated by the plutonium. Two flats in Landau in the Rhineland-Palatinate were contaminated, and had to be cleaned at a cost of two million euro. Photographs of the case and details of other nuclear crimes have been presented by a worker at the Institute for Transuranium Elements.\n\nAlexander Litvinenko died from polonium-210 poisoning in 2006. British officials said investigators had concluded the murder of Litvinenko was \"a 'state-sponsored' assassination orchestrated by Russian security services.\" On 20 January 2007 British police announced that they had \"identified the man they believe poisoned Alexander Litvinenko,\" Andrei Lugovoi.\n\nOn the 21st of September 2012 a story was posted in various UK newspapers suggesting the existence of an ongoing cover-up by the British Government over the material facts of the case.\nThe report suggests that many aspects of the case may \"never see the light of day\" due to the significant risk to UK/Russian relations and the implications of the declaration that an act of nuclear terrorism took place on British soil.\n\nRoman Tsepov, a politically influential Russian who provided security to Vladimir Putin and others, fell sick on September 11, 2004 after a trip to Moscow, and died on September 24. A postmortem investigation found a poisoning by an unspecified radioactive material. He had symptoms similar to Aleksandr Litvinenko.\n\nAn unnamed truck driver was killed by 5 months of radiation exposure to a cesium-137 source that had been put into the door of his truck around February 1995. He died of radiation-induced leukemia on 27 April 1997.\n\nIn 1993, director of the Kartontara packing company Vladimir Kaplun was killed by radioactive material (cobalt-60 and/or cesium-137) placed in his chair. He died of radiation sickness after a month of hospitalization. The source of the radiation was found after his death.\n\nOn November 5, 1974, Kerr-McGee worker and labor union activist Karen Silkwood found herself exposed to plutonium-239 after working to grind and polish plutonium pellets by way of a glovebox to be used in nuclear fuel rods at the Cimarron Fuel Fabrication Site in Oklahoma. Inspection of the gloves would yield no evidence of external leakage of radioactive contaminant from the glovebox, despite the fact that plutonium had been found on those surfaces of the gloves that had contact with Silkwood's hands, and no other source for a plutonium leak could be ascertained despite thorough inspections of the air vents and surrounding surfaces. However, on November 6, despite Silkwood's prior decontamination and self-inspection, a detection on her part the next day yielded more signs of alpha activity on her hands, while health physics staff at the plant subsequently detected further alpha activity on her right forearm, neck and face. On November 7, Silkwood tested positive for very significant levels of alpha activity, and an inspection of her apartment showed high levels of radioactive contamination. Thereafter, Silkwood and two other co-workers personally associated with her (roommate Sherri Ellis and boyfriend Drew Stephens) would be tested at Los Alamos National Laboratory; while the latter two only tested positive for insignificant amounts of plutonium exposure, Silkwood was found to have of plutonium-239 in her lungs, though researcher Dr. George Voelz insisted that this amount was still negligible and non-harmful. Later posthumous measurements taken after Silkwood's death under separate but likewise controversial circumstances were shown to be roughly consistent with the initial findings described by Dr. Voelz, but also indicated that she had somehow ingested plutonium prior to her demise. It would also be found that Karen Silkwood would not have had access to plutonium-239 for months after her transfer from metallography to rod assembly.\n\nAllegations that Silkwood's exposure to plutonium-239 was a deliberate act of radiation poisoning are fueled by the fact that she was in possession of potentially compromising evidence that linked Kerr-McGee with egregious safety violations, encompassing unsafe workplace conditions at the plant, faulty manufacture of fuel rod components that posed a potential public safety risk, and even substantial missing plutonium supplies that were unaccounted for; Silkwood also contended that she had evidence that photographs containing evidence of hairline cracks in the fuel rods may have been doctored by company personnel as a cover-up. As Silkwood was coordinating with fellow union members and had been \"en route\" to meet a journalist to present and discuss evidence she had found of Kerr-McGee's actions at the time of her death, unverified assertions that Kerr-McGee or other associated parties may have been involved in her radiation exposure and later fatal car accident have circulated in the following period.\n\nFor accidental theft or attempted theft of radioactive materials, see the list of radiation accidents.\n\nOn 13 September 1999, six people attempted to steal radioactive cobalt-60 rods from a chemical plant in the city of Grozny in the Chechen Republic. During the theft, the suspects opened the radioactive material container and handled it, resulting in the deaths of three of the suspects and injury of the remaining three. The suspect who held the material directly in his hands died of radiation exposure 30 minutes later. This incident is described as an attempted theft, but some of the rods are reportedly still missing.\n\nSome former East German dissidents claim that the Stasi used X-ray equipment to induce cancer in political prisoners.\n\nSimilarly, some anti-Castro activists claim that the Cuban secret police sometimes used radioactive isotopes to induce cancer in \"adversaries they wished to destroy with as little notice as possible\". In 1997, the Cuban expatriate columnist Carlos Alberto Montaner called this method \"the Bulgarian Treatment\", after its alleged use by the Bulgarian secret police.\n\nIn the early 20th century a series of products claiming medicinal properties, which contained radioactive elements were marketed to the general public. This does not include certain medications that contain radioactive isotopes (e.g. iodine-131 for its oncological uses) but pertains to elixirs and other medications that made preposterous claims (see below) that were neither scientific nor verifiable.\n\nRadithor, a well known patent medicine/snake oil, is possibly the best known example of radioactive quackery. It consisted of triple distilled water containing at a minimum each of the radium-226 and radium-228 isotopes.\n\nRadithor was manufactured from 1918 - 1928 by the Bailey Radium Laboratories, Inc., of East Orange, New Jersey. The head of the laboratories was listed as Dr. William J. A. Bailey, not a medical doctor. It was advertised as \"A Cure for the Living Dead\" as well as \"Perpetual Sunshine\".\n\nThese radium elixirs were marketed similar to the way opiates were peddled to the masses with laudanum an age earlier, and electrical cure-alls during the same time period such as the Prostate Warmer.\n\nThe eventual death of the socialite Eben Byers from Radithor consumption and the associated radiation poisoning led to the strengthening of the Food and Drug Administration's powers and the demise of most radiation based patent medication.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5031680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5031680", "title": "Dating violence", "text": "Dating violence\n\nDating abuse or dating violence is defined as the perpetration or threat of an act of violence by at least one member of an unmarried couple on the other member within the context of dating or courtship. It is also when one partner tries to maintain power and control over the other through abuse/violence. This abuse/violence can take a number of forms: sexual assault, sexual harassment, threats, physical violence, verbal, mental, or emotional abuse, social sabotage, and stalking. It can include psychological abuse, emotional blackmail, sexual abuse, physical abuse and psychological manipulation.\n\nDating violence crosses all racial, age, economic and social lines. The Center for Relationship Abuse Awareness describes dating abuse as a \"pattern of abusive and coercive behaviors used to maintain power and control over a former or current intimate partner.\" The Family & Community Development support group at eCitizen in Singapore has described what it calls tell-tale signs of an abusive relationship.\n\nIndividuals of all walks of life can find themselves in an abusive relationship. Abuse can occur regardless of the couple's age, race, income, or other demographic traits. There are, however, many traits that abusers and victims share in common. \n\nThe Centre for Promoting Alternatives to Violence describes abusers as being obsessively jealous and possessive, overly confident, having mood swings or a history of violence or temper, seeking to isolate their partner from family, friends and colleagues, and having a tendency to blame external stressors.\n\nMeanwhile, victims of relationship abuse share many traits as well, including: physical signs of injury, missing time at work or school, slipping performance at work or school, changes in mood or personality, increased use of drugs or alcohol, and increasing isolation from friends and family. Victims may blame themselves for any abuse that occurs or may minimize the severity of the crime. This often leads to victims choosing to stay in abusive relationships.\n\nStrauss (2005) argues that while men inflict the greater share of injuries in domestic violence, researchers and society at large must not overlook the substantial minority of injuries inflicted by women. Additionally, Strauss notes that even relatively minor acts of physical aggression by women are a serious concern:\n\nSimilarly, Deborah Capaldi reports that a 13-year longitudinal study found that a woman's aggression towards a man was equally important as the man's tendency towards violence in predicting the likelihood of overall violence: \"Since much IPV [Intimate Partner Violence] is mutual and women as well as men initiate IPV, prevention and treatment approaches should attempt to reduce women's violence as well as men's violence. Such an approach has a much higher chance of increasing women's safety.\" However, Capaldi's research only focused on at-risk youth, not women in general, and, therefore, may not apply to the entire population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "617574", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=617574", "title": "Era of Stagnation", "text": "Era of Stagnation\n\nThe Era of Stagnation (, Stagnation Period, also called the Brezhnevian Stagnation) was the period in the history of the Soviet Union which began during the rule of Leonid Brezhnev (1964–1982) and continued under Yuri Andropov (1982–1984) and Konstantin Chernenko (1984–1985). The term \"Era of Stagnation\" was coined by Mikhail Gorbachev in order to describe the negative way in which he viewed the economic, political, and social policies of the period.\n\nDuring the period of Brezhnev's leadership, the term \"Era of Stagnation\" was not used. Instead Brezhnev used the term \"period of developed socialism\" (Russian: период развитого социализма) for the period which started in 1971. This term stemmed from Khrushchev's promise in 1961 of reaching communism in 20 years. It was in the 1980s that the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev coined the term \"Era of Stagnation\" to describe the economic difficulties that developed when Leonid Brezhnev ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982. Scholars have subsequently disagreed on the dates, significance and causes of the stagnation. Supporters of Gorbachev have criticised Brezhnev, and the Brezhnev administration in general, for being too conservative and failing to change with the times.\n\nThe 1964–82 period in the Soviet Union began hopefully but devolved into disillusionment. Social stagnation began following Brezhnev's rise to power, when he revoked several of the relatively liberal reforms of his predecessor, Nikita Khrushchev, and partially rehabilitated Stalinist policies. Some commentators regard the start of social stagnation as being the Sinyavsky–Daniel trial in 1966, which marked the end of Nikita Khrushchev's \"Thaw\", while others place it at the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968.\nThe period's political stagnation is associated with the establishment of gerontocracy, which came into being as part of the policy of stability.\n\nThe majority of scholars set the starting year for economic stagnation at 1975, although some claim that it began as early as the 1960s. Industrial growth rates declined during the 1970s as heavy industry and the arms industry were prioritized while Soviet consumer goods were neglected. The value of all consumer goods manufactured in 1972 in retail prices was about 118 billion rubles ($530 billion). Historians, scholars, and specialists are uncertain what caused the stagnation, with some arguing that the command economy suffered from systemic flaws which inhibited growth. Others have argued that the lack of reform, or the high expenditures on the military, led to stagnation.\n\nBrezhnev has been criticised posthumously for doing too little to improve the economic situation. Throughout his rule, no major reforms were initiated and the few proposed reforms were either very modest or opposed by the majority of the Soviet leadership. The reform-minded Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Government), Alexei Kosygin, introduced two modest reforms in the 1970s after the failure of his more radical 1965 reform, and attempted to reverse the trend of declining growth. By the 1970s, Brezhnev had consolidated enough power to stop any \"radical\" reform-minded attempts by Kosygin.\n\nWhen Brezhnev died in November 1982, the Soviet Union he handed over to his successor, Yuri Andropov, was much less dynamic than when he assumed power. During his short rule, Andropov introduced modest reforms; he died little more than a year later in February 1984. Konstantin Chernenko, his successor, continued much of Andropov's policies. The economic problems that began under Brezhnev persisted into these short administrations and scholars still debate whether the reform policies that were followed improved the economic situation in the country.\n\nThe Era of Stagnation ended with Gorbachev's rise to power during which political and social life was democratised even though the economy was still stagnating. Under Gorbachev's leadership the Communist Party began efforts to accelerate development in 1985 through massive injections of finance into heavy industry \"(Uskoreniye)\". When these failed, the Communist Party restructured \"(perestroika)\" the Soviet economy and government by introducing quasi-capitalist \"(Khozraschyot)\" and democratic \"(demokratizatsiya)\" reforms. These were intended to re-energize the Soviet Union but inadvertently led to its dissolution in 1991.\n\nRobert Service, author of the \"History of Modern Russia: From Tsarism to the Twenty-first Century\", claims that with mounting economic problems worker discipline decreased, which the Government could not counter effectively because of the full employment policy. According to Service, this policy led to government industries, such as factories, mines and offices, being staffed by undisciplined and unproductive personnel ultimately leading to a \"work-shy workforce\" among Soviet workers and administrators. While the Soviet Union under Brezhnev had the \"second greatest industrial capacity\" after the United States, and produced more \"steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and [...] tractors\" than any other country in the world, Service treats the problems of agriculture during the Brezhnev era as proof of the need for decollectivization. In short, Service considers the Soviet economy to have become \"static\" during this time period, and Brezhnev's policy of stability was a \"recipe for political disaster\".\n\nRichard Sakwa, author of the book \"The Rise and Fall of the Soviet Union: 1917–1991\", takes a dimmer view of the Brezhnev era by claiming that growth rates fell \"inexorably\" from the 1950s until they stopped completely in the 1980s. His reasoning for this stagnation was the growing demand for unskilled workers resulted in a decline of productivity and labour discipline. Sakwa believes that stability itself led to stagnation and claimed that without strong leadership \"Soviet socialism had a tendency to relapse into stagnation.\"\n\nAccording to Edwin Bacon and Mark Sandle, authors of \"Brezhnev Reconsidered\", the economy under Brezhnev was as dynamic as the economy presided over by Nikita Khrushchev, but this dynamism had stalled by the time Yuri Andropov, and subsequently Konstantin Chernenko, became General Secretary. Mark Harrison claims that the economic performance of the Brezhnev era has not been looked at objectively as analysis of the period sometimes used lower estimates. Harrison further claims that in the period between 1928 and 1973 the Soviet economy grew in a phase that would surpass the United States \"one day\". During the international oil crisis, growth in the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc halted abruptly and stalled for a longer period than in the West causing the economy to begin stagnating. One explanation, according to Harrison, is that the Soviet economy could not sustain its extensive growth patterns. Other explanations include: the lack of Soviet, and communist bloc, transparency with other nations hindering globalisation and misinterpretation of a \"permanent\" post–World War II economic boom leading to faulty economic decisions. He claims that the economic policies of Andropov, and Chernenko, had improved the economic situation in the country and Mikhail Gorbachev inherited a more dynamic and vibrant economy in a \"pre-crisis situation\" where the economy was still growing with low internal and external debts, compared to the economy that Andropov and Chernenko inherited.\n\nArchie Brown, author of \"The Rise and Fall of Communism\", claims in his book that the term Era of Stagnation \"was in many ways a fitting description, for this was a period of declining growth\", but noted it could be misleading in non-economic spheres. Brown states there were high growth rates in the mid-to-late 1960s (during the Eighth Five-Year Plan) claiming that the Soviet economy \"enjoyed stronger growth in the second half of the 1960s than it ever did thereafter\". The link between these growth rates and the Kosygin reform is, according to Brown, \"tenuous\", but says that \"From the point of view of communist rulers, the Brezhnev era was in many ways successful\". While the Soviet Union was in no way an economic power, its natural resources provided a strong economic foundation, which bore fruit during the 1973 oil crisis and \"turned out to be an energy bonanza\". On the other hand, Brown states it was a sign of weakness that the Soviet Union grew so dependent on her natural resources, as she did in the 1970s.\n\nPhilip Hanson, author of \"The Rise and Fall of the Soviet economy: an Economic History of the USSR from 1945\", claims that the label stagnation is not \"entirely unfair\". Brezhnev, according to Hanson, did preside over a period of slowdown in economic growth, but claims that the era started with good growth that was at a higher rate than during the end of Khrushchev's rule. Economic slowdown began in 1973 \"when even the official estimates began to show Soviet per capita production no longer closing the gap with the US.\" Before 1973, there was a reform period launched by Alexei Kosygin, which many believed would become as radical as those in the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia and the previous reform attempts in Hungary. According to Hanson, many assumed that growth during the Brezhnev era did not stop but started to stagnate. However, not everything stagnated as per capita consumption grew by 1.9% during the 1970s, which is a \"highly respectable rate\" of growth. Another point which Hanson makes is that, in contrast to the repressive policies of Joseph Stalin and instability-inducing policies of Khrushchev, the Brezhnev era was stable and a \"period of (comparative) plenty\".\n\nRobert Vincent Daniels in his book, \"Russia's Transformation: Snapshots of a Crumbling System\", claimed that the hallmark of the Brezhnev era was the \"status quo\", which in turn led to the development of a great \"paradox\"; \"the contradictions of what it was and what it could be became obvious\". Net growth, in excess of 50% and as high as two thirds, was primarily in the urban sector resulting in high population growth and urban growth higher than that of the United States. Industrial development continued to grow rapidly, and in certain sectors surpassed the United States. As an example, coal production in the Soviet Union increased from 85 million metric tons in 1964 to 149 million metric tons in 1981 while in the United States it grew from 100 million to 130 million metric tons in the same period. The Soviet Union became the largest exporter of petroleum in the world and by the end of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) the Soviet GNP \"reached about 60% of the American level, and the net current investment was actually greater in absolute terms\". The failure then, according to Daniels, was that the Soviet economy was not able to deliver in certain sectors; agriculture is a sector where this failure occurred. Throughout Soviet history, deficiencies in agriculture and consumer goods always existed. During Brezhnev's reign, the Soviet Union became the largest producer of wheat in the world but was unable to produce meat in sufficient quantities. According to Daniels, the economy began to stagnate in 1975 rather than 1973 and that the following period contradicted the previous one \"in almost every way\".\n\nThe research in second economy in the Soviet Union, pioneered by Gregory Grossman, indicated that during 1970s-1980s the effects of the central planning were progressively distorted due to the rapid growth of the shadow economy. It is suggested that failure to account for it by Gosplan contributed to the stagnation, and ultimately to the collapse of the Soviet economy.\n\nOne of the suggested causes of stagnation was the increased military expenditure over consumer goods and other economic spheres. Andrei Sakharov, the veteran dissident, claimed in a 1980 letter to Brezhnev that the increasing expenditure on the armed forces was stalling economic growth. However, David Michael Kotz and Fred Weir, authors of \"Revolution from Above: The Demise of the Soviet System\", argue that militarisation cannot be the prime cause for the economic stagnation, as military spending had historically been high (17% of GNP in 1950) and had increased on par with economic growth without previously destabilising the economy.\n\nDuring the Nixon Shock and the 1973 oil crisis, economic growth in the rest of the world plummeted but the Soviet hard currency earnings grew as a result of oil exports. Following the crisis, overall economic activity decreased markedly in the Soviet Union, the Western Bloc and Japan, but in the Soviet Union it was much more pronounced. Kotz and Weir argued that ultimately, economic stagnation in the Soviet Union could only have been caused by internal problems rather than external.\n\nSome Marxist-Leninist writers have argued that economic stagnation was a result of revisionism in Soviet economic policy during Khrushchev's leadership. According to authors like Harpal Brar, Khrushchev's de-Stalinization program was also used to implement economic reforms that would move the USSR away from central planning and towards market socialism. This is also supported by comparing economic performance preceding the reforms with post-reform economic performance.\n\nOne of the main causes for Khrushchev's dismissal from power was the relatively poor economic growth during the early 1960s. Overall economic growth was 6% from 1951 to 1955 but had fallen to 5.8% in the subsequent 5 years and to 5% from 1961 to 1965. Labour productivity, which had grown 4.7% from the 1950s to 1962, had declined to 4% by the early 1960s. Growth, capital out and investments were all showing signs of steady decline. Another problem was Khrushchev's unrealistic promises such as committing to reach communism in 20 years, a near impossibility with the then-current economic indicators. Ultimately, as a result of his failure to deliver on his promises and the problems engendered, Khrushchev was dismissed in October 1964 by a collective leadership led by Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin. To counter Khrushchev's promise of reaching communism, the Soviet leadership created the term developed socialism, which meant that the Soviet Union had developed to a sufficiently advanced stage that the country would move \"naturally\" to communism (in an unspecified amount of time).\n\nKhrushchev's dismissal led to the establishment of a more conservative Politburo; Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny and Andrei Kirilenko were the most liberal members, Brezhnev and Arvīds Pelše belonged to the moderate faction while Mikhail Suslov retained his leadership of the party's hardliners. Kosygin and Brezhnev strongly disagreed over economic policy; Kosygin wanted to increase investments in consumer goods and light industry whereas Brezhnev wanted to increase investment in heavy industry, agriculture and defence. In 1965, Kosygin introduced an economic reform, widely referred to as the \"Kosygin reform\", which aimed to reform the planned economy within a socialist framework. In a bid to improve the Soviet economy Kosygin copied some of the measures used in the Western Bloc, such as profit making, which Brezhnev agreed to as the Soviet economy was entering a period of low growth. Kosygin's reforms on agriculture gave considerable autonomy to the collective farms, giving them the right to the contents of private farming. As a result, during the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1966–1970), large-scale land reclamation programmes, construction of irrigation channels, and other measures, were enacted. Overall, the reform failed and links to any high growth rates during the Eighth Five-Year Plan are considered to be \"tenuous\".\n\nThe Brezhnev era, which had begun with high growth, began to stagnate some time in the early-1970s. Kosygin's \"radical\" reform attempts were halted in 1971 and his second reform was more modest. The second reform was halted because of the 1973 oil crisis, when an international increase in oil price prompted economic growth based on selling oil. Another reform was implemented in 1979 but this, too, failed as by this time the Soviet economy had become \"addicted\" to high oil prices.\n\nIn 1980, RIA Novosti reported that the Soviet Union showed the highest, in Europe, and second highest, worldwide, industrial and agricultural output. The Soviet statistics claimed that in 1960, the Soviet Union's industrial output was only 55% that of America, but this increased to 80% by 1980. The 18 years of Brezhnev's leadership of the Communist Party saw real incomes grow by more than 1.5 times. More than 1.6 billion square meters of living space was commissioned and provided to over 160 million people. At the same time, the average rent for families did not exceed 3% of the family income. Housing, health care, and education were affordable and low-priced. As the circulation of the work force could not be balanced by salaries, there was a lack of workers in some areas, largely in the agricultural sector. This was partly solved by forcing \"nonproductive\" urban population (older pupils, students, scientists, soldiers, etc.) to work during the harvesting time as agricultural workers. The practice has been informally called \"naryady na kartoshku\" ( \"assignments to potato fields\").\n\nActs of protest took place in reaction to the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia with protesters being dismissed from their jobs, beaten or arrested. Eight protesters held a demonstration in Red Square in Moscow and were subsequently imprisoned. A number of suspected dissidents had their homes and property searched and a group of Moscow lawyers specialised in defending people charged with anti-Soviet activity. Supporters of these meetings and demonstrations claimed that the arrests were illegal, because there is no criminality in the realization of the human right to obtain and distribute information. They asserted this right was part of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the final act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (1975).\n\nDuring the introduction of glasnost, many writers claimed that they did not know about the repression of citizens who did not support the Brezhnev politics. However, artists propagating \"Soviet values\" within the framework of Socialist realism formed a well paid, elite group that enjoyed an easy life and high social status.\n\nNevertheless, a noticeable part of Soviet scientists and artists (collectively known as \"the dissidents\") continued both open and clandestine political opposition to the regime which they began during the Khruschev rule. Prominent nuclear physicist Andrey Sakharov and Soviet Army General Pyotr Grigorenko are well-known representatives of this movement.\n\nMany other members of the Soviet intelligentsia systematically criticized the social and moral manifestations of the Stagnation without overtly challenging the authorities. Examples include writers Viktor Astafyev and Oles Honchar, playwright Grigory Gorin, directors Eldar Ryazanov and Mark Zakharov.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2359611", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2359611", "title": "Famine scales", "text": "Famine scales\n\nFamine scales are the ways in which degrees of food security are measured, from situations in which an entire population has adequate food to full-scale famine. The word \"famine\" has highly emotive and political connotations and there has been extensive discussion among international relief agencies offering food aid as to its exact definition. For example, in 1998, although a full-scale famine had developed in southern Sudan, a disproportionate amount of donor food resources went to the Kosovo War. This ambiguity about whether or not a famine is occurring, and the lack of commonly agreed upon criteria by which to differentiate food insecurity has prompted renewed interest in offering precise definitions. As different levels of food insecurity demand different types of response, there have been various methods of famine measurement proposed to help agencies determine the appropriate response.\n\nA tension that has existed in all attempts to define a famine is between definitions of famine as an event and definitions as a process. In the first case, famine is defined (roughly) as the event of many people dying of starvation within a locality or region. In the second, famine is described as a chronology beginning with a disruption or disruptions that gradually leads to widespread death. However, these general definitions have little utility for those implementing food relief as \"region\", \"widespread\", etc. are undefined.\n\nOne of the earliest methods of measurement was the Indian Famine Codes developed by the colonial British in the 1880s. The Famine Codes defined three levels of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine. \"Scarcity\" was defined as three successive years of crop failure, crop yields of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress. \"Famine\" further included a rise in food prices above 140% of \"normal\", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality. The Punjab Food Code stated, \"Imminence of death is the sole criterion for declaration of famine.\" Inherent in the Famine Codes was the assumption that famine was an event, and not a process.\n\nThe basic premise of the Famine Codes formed the basis of numerous subsequent early warning systems. One of the most efficacious is the Turkana District Early Warning System in northern Kenya in which indicators include rainfall levels, market prices of cereals, status of livestock, rangeland conditions and trends, and enrollment on food-for-work projects. The system identifies three levels of crisis: alarm, alert and emergency, each of which is linked to a planned response to mitigate the crisis and try to prevent a worsening of the situation.\n\nInternational organizations responding to recent food crises created \"ad hoc\" measurements. In 2002, the World Food Programme created a number of \"pre-famine indicators\" for Ethiopia and combined it with measurements of nutrition levels to create recommendations. The Food Security Assessment Unit (FSAU) devised a system for Somalia with four levels: Non-alert (near normal), Alert (requires close attention), Livelihood Crisis (basic social structures under threat) and Humanitarian Emergency (threat of widespread mortality requiring immediate humanitarian assistance).\n\nThe FSAU system is one of several recent systems that draws a distinction between \"saving lives\" and \"saving livelihoods\". Older models concentrated simply on the mortality of famine victims. However, relief agencies gradually realized that the means by which families and individuals supported themselves were threatened first.\n\nPreviously famines had been perceived as a threat to individuals, even large numbers of individuals. Inherent in the livelihoods strategies outlook is the conception of famine as a social problem. Populations affected by increased food stress will try to cope through market structures (i.e. selling possessions for food) and reliance upon community and family support structures. It is only when such social structures collapse under the strain that individuals are faced with the malnutrition and starvation that has commonly been viewed as \"famine\".\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, studies of the process by which populations adapted to food stress as food security worsened received much attention. Four stages of the process were identified:\n\nVarious nutrition benchmarks have been proposed as the cut-off points for food insecurity levels. The United Nations Refugee Nutrition Information System lists a number of such indicator cutoff points:\n\n\nThe use of these cut-offs is contentious. Some argue that a crude mortality rate of one death per ten thousand people per day is already a full-scale emergency. Others note that while most indicators are focused on children, parents will often reduce their own food consumption in favor of their children. Child malnutrition may thus be a trailing indicator, indicating non-emergency levels even after adult malnutrition has reached crisis levels. It has also been noted that malnutrition is often not directly related to food availability; malnutrition is often the result of disease or poor child-care practices, even with adequate food availability.\n\nIn an influential paper published in 2004, Paul Howe and Stephen Devereux, both of the Institute of Development Studies at the University of Sussex, set forth a measurement of famine with scales for both \"intensity\" and \"magnitude\", incorporating many of the developments of recent decades. The intensity scale is:\n\nOn the magnitude scale:\nUsing this framework, each famine would receive a Magnitude designation, but locations within the affected region would be classified at varying Intensities. The 1998 southern Sudan famine would be a C: Major Famine, with an intensity of 5: Extreme famine in Ajiep village ranging to 3: Famine in Rumbek town. In comparison, the 2000 Ethiopian famine in Gode district would be classified as a B: Moderate famine, and would thus should demand proportionally less of the limited resources available for famine relief.\n\nWhile each organization working in famine-related areas has its own operational interpretation of specific indicators, the Howe-Devereaux framework has been widely adopted as a common framework by which famine warning and famine relief may be discussed worldwide, in particular in the use of the intensity scale. This has led organizations such as the World Food Programme to refrain from referring to the 2005 Niger food crisis as a famine, as indicators had not deteriorated into a Level 3: Famine.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1054273", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1054273", "title": "Ganser syndrome", "text": "Ganser syndrome\n\nGanser syndrome is a rare dissociative disorder characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions and other dissociative symptoms such as fugue, amnesia or conversion disorder, often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. The syndrome has also been called nonsense syndrome, balderdash syndrome, syndrome of approximate answers, hysterical pseudodementia or prison psychosis. The term prison psychosis is sometimes used because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may be seen as an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials. Psychological symptoms generally resemble the patient's sense of mental illness rather than any recognized category. The syndrome may occur in persons with other mental disorders such as schizophrenia, depressive disorders, toxic states, paresis, alcohol use disorders and factitious disorders. Ganser syndrome can sometimes be diagnosed as merely malingering, but it is more often defined as dissociative disorder.\nThe discovery of Ganser syndrome is attributed to Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser (24 January 1853–4 January 1931). In 1898, he described the disorder in prisoners awaiting trial in a penal institution in Halle, Germany. He named impaired consciousness and distorted communication, namely in the form of approximate answers (also referred to as Vorbeireden in literature), as the defining symptoms of the syndrome. Vorbeireden involves the inability to answer questions precisely, although the content of the questions is understood.\nGanser syndrome is described as a Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (NOS) in the DSM-IV, and is not currently listed in the DSM-V. It is a rare and an often overlooked clinical phenomenon. In most cases, it is preceded by extreme stress and followed by amnesia for the period of psychosis. In addition to approximate answers, other symptoms include a clouding of consciousness, somatic conversion disorder symptoms, confusion, stress, loss of personal identity, echolalia, and echopraxia.\n\nGanser syndrome was listed under Factitious Disorder with Psychological Symptoms in the DSM-III. The criteria of this category emphasized symptoms that cannot be explained by other mental disorders, psychological symptoms under the control of the individual, and the goal of assuming a patient role, not otherwise understandable given their circumstances. \nThe DSM-IV-TR classified Ganser syndrome as a dissociative disorder defined by the giving of approximate answers to questions (e.g. '2 plus 2 equals 5' when not associated with dissociative amnesia or dissociative fugue). The ICD-10 and DSM-IV do not specify any diagnostic criteria apart from approximate answers, as a requirement for a Ganser syndrome diagnosis. Most case studies of the syndrome also depend on the presence of approximate answers and at least one of the other symptoms described by Ganser in his original paper. Usually when giving wrong answers, individuals are only slightly off, showing that the individual understood the questionFor instance, when asked how many legs a horse has, they might say, \"five.\" Although subjects appear confused in their answers, in other respects they appear to understand their surroundings. Amnesia, loss of personal identity, and clouding of consciousness were among the most common symptoms apart from approximate answers.\nAlthough there is currently no uniform way to diagnose the syndrome, a full neurological and mental state examination is recommended to determine its presence as well as tests that assess malingering. In addition to mental examination, other investigations should be done to exclude other underlying causes. These include computer tomography scans (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to exclude structural pathology, lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis or encephalitis, and electroencephalography (EEG), to exclude delirium or seizure disorder.\nDiagnosing Ganser syndrome is challenging because of its rarity and symptom variability. The manifested symptoms may be dependent on the individual’s conception of what mental illness entails, creating the possibility of a wide range of combinations of symptoms present in an individual with Ganser syndrome.\n\nWith about 100 cases studies, the incidence of the disorder is not precisely known. Individuals of multiple backgrounds have been reported as having the disorder. The syndrome tends to be more common in men (75%), with a male to female ratio of 4:1. It has been most frequently seen in individuals ages 15 to 40 and has also been observed in children. This wide age range is derived from case studies, and therefore may not be an accurate estimate. Ganser syndrome has also been observed in groups other than prison populations.\nTo date, no definitive cause or reason of the disorder has been established. The sources that classify the syndrome as a dissociative disorder or a factitious disorder, conflict in their proposed etiologies. As a result, there are a number of theories as to why the syndrome develops. \nGanser syndrome was previously classified as a factitious disorder, explaining the symptoms as mimicking of what patients perceive as typical of a psychosis, even though they are not really sick. However, the DSM-IV placed the syndrome under “Dissociative Disorders Not Otherwise Specified.” There has been evidence of a strong correlation between approximate answers and amnesia, suggesting that these have an underlying dissociative mechanism.\n\nBoth Ganser’s syndrome and Dissociative Disorders have been linked to histories of hysteria, psychosis, conversion, multiple personality and possible feigning. Despite this, the condition’s etiology remains under question due to associations with established psychiatric disorders, as well as organic states. \nAccording to Stern and Whiles (1942), Ganser syndrome is a fundamentally psychotic illness. As evidence, they describe the case of a woman suffering from recurrent mania and a head injury before being submitted to treatment and the report of a schizophrenic male who suffered from alcoholism and had recently been in prison.\nGanser syndrome is also sometimes referred to as “prison psychosis,” emphasizing its prevalence among prisoners, generating discussion about whether the disorder only appears in this population. In a study of prisoners, Estes and New concluded that escaping an intolerable situation, such as being incarcerated, prompted the syndrome’s key symptoms, touching on the malingering controversy surrounding the syndrome, as well as the stress component that often precedes the disorder.\nAccording to F.A. Whitlock, Ganser syndrome is a hysterical disorder, on par with Ganser’s description of the disorder. Whitlock pointed to the number of cases in which Ganser syndrome was reported in settings of organic brain disease or functional psychosis as evidence of its hysterical foundations. Kraepelin and Bumke also believed the syndrome to be of a hysterical nature.Bumke thought the syndrome had to be hysterical because amnesia for a traumatic emotional event tends to occur in hysteria more than in other disorders.The giving of approximate answers is thought to be produced in hysterical personalities. \nAccording to Mayer-Gross and Bleuler, Ganser syndrome occurs mainly in epileptic or schizophrenic patients, as if Ganser patients are followed long enough, some display schizophrenic reactions.\nStill others, claim that an organic condition that could lead to the manifestation of Ganser syndrome symptoms would have to be at an advanced stage in which a diagnosis could be easily given.\nThere have also been reports of trauma and stroke patients with the syndrome. A study investigating the neurological basis of Ganser syndrome, described a patient with symptoms of the disorder who had a history of stroke and bifrontal infarcts. They discovered that hyperglutamatergic states (link to wikipedia page), which are caused by both strokes and stress, share a relationship with dissociative symptoms, suggesting a possible organic pathology that can predispose individuals to the syndrome. Wirtz and colleagues (2008) described a patient with Ganser syndrome after a left-hemispheric middle cerebral artery infarct.A neuropsychological examination revealed atypical lateralisation of cognitive functions, leading to the conclusion that the giving of approximate answers might be related to frontal-executive cerebral dysfunction.\nIn many cases, the symptoms seem to dwindle after a few days, and patients are often left with amnesia for the period of psychosis. Hospitalization may be necessary during the acute phase of symptoms, and psychiatric care if the patient is a danger to self or others. A neurological consult is advised to rule out any organic cause. Psychotherapy may also recommended for ensuring and maintaining safety.\nGanser patients typically recover quickly and completely. Since Ganser syndrome can be a response to psychic deterioration, its resolution may be followed by other psychiatric symptoms, such as schizophrenia and depression, hence the rationale behind the recommendation of psychotherapy. Medication is usually not required.\nThere is controversy regarding whether Ganser syndrome is a valid clinical entity. For example, Bromberg (1986) has argued that the syndrome is not due to or related to mental illness, but rather a sort of defense against legal punishment. Some see it as conscious lying, denial and repression, presenting Ganser syndrome symptoms as malingering instead of a dissociative or factitious disorder.\nOne case study of Ganser syndrome presented a middle-aged man who had been in a car crash and wanted disability insurance benefits. Since he had a big incentive, psychologists took careful measures and implemented testing with malingering instruments, which showed that the man performed below chance on simple memory tests and claimed to experience nonexistent symptoms. Upon further inspection of the collateral information, they found that the patient took part in high-level sports and other activities that were inconsistent with the cognitive dysfunctions he reported, and they determined it to be a case of malingering.\nEstes and New concluded that the motivation for the symptoms of the syndrome was escaping an “intolerable situation.” Stern and Whiles proposed an alternative explanation, citing Ganser syndrome presented itself in individuals who, although not psychologically well, do not realize it, and want to appear so. \nStill others attribute the syndrome to inattention, purposeful evasion, suppression, alcoholic excess, head injury, and to unconscious attempts to deceive others as a means to free themselves from responsibility for their actions. This denial of behavior can be seen as a way to overcome anxiety and helplessness brought on by the stressful event that often precedes the syndrome.\nThese aetiological debates focus on the main symptom of Ganser syndrome and its importance in its diagnosis. Approximate answers are prominent in the Ganser syndrome literature, causing concern in those who believe that this is a relatively simple symptom to feign.\nGanser syndrome was regarded as an Adjustment Reaction of Adult Life in the DSM-II and later was moved under the category of Factitious Disorder with Psychological Symptoms in the DSM-III. Ganser syndrome can also be found under the Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (DDNOS) section of the DSM-IV-TR, however it is not listed in the DSM-V, which got rid of the DDNOS section and replaced it with Other Specified Dissociative Disorder (OSDD) and Unspecified Dissociative Disorder (USDD).. Despite this, the International Classification of Diseases has Ganser syndrome listed under dissociative disorders.\n \n"}

He became involved in what, at the time, were regarded as revolutionary and anarchist causes and needed to be recalled. He had supposedly been involved in plans to assassinate heads of state, including French Emperor Napoleon III, or foment causes to bring about democratic reform. During the Civil War, he was involved in activities in Montreal that were supposed to support the Confederacy by unorthodox means.

His book alleges that in June 1864, Sanders was in Montreal, Canada, Sanders was plotting against Lincoln with the Confederate Secret Service. Higham asserts that when John Wilkes Booth, Lincoln's assassin, arrived in Montreal in October of 1864, he fell under the influence of Sanders and arranged Lincoln's assassination there. In 1864, General Ulysses S. Grant suspended trade with the Confederate Army, which Lincoln had allowed a limited amount.

As a form of coercive monopoly, government-granted monopoly is contrasted with a \"coercive monopoly\" or an \"efficiency monopoly\", where there is no competition but it is not forcibly excluded. Amongst forms of coercive monopoly it is distinguished from government monopoly or state monopoly (in which \"government agencies\" hold the legally enforced monopoly rather than private individuals or firms) and from government-sponsored cartels (in which the government forces \"several independent\" producers to partially coordinate their decisions through a centralized organization). Advocates for government-granted monopolies often claim that they ensure a degree of public control over essential industries, without having those industries actually run by the state. Opponents often criticize them as political favors to corporations. Government-granted monopolies may be opposed by those who would prefer free markets as well as by those who would prefer to replace private corporations with public ownership.\n\nUnder mercantilist economic systems, European governments with colonial interests often granted large and extremely lucrative monopolies to companies trading in particular regions, such as the Dutch East India Company.\n\nToday, government-granted monopolies may be found in public utility services such as public roads, mail, water supply, and electric power, as well as certain specialized and highly regulated fields such as education and gambling. In many countries lucrative natural resources industries, especially the petroleum industry, are controlled by government-granted monopolies. Franchises granted by governments to operate public transit through public roads are another example.\n\nA patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a state or national government to an inventor or his/her assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for a public disclosure of an invention.\n\nThe procedure for granting patents, the requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a patent application must include one or more claims defining the invention which must be new, inventive, and useful or industrially applicable. In many countries, certain subject areas are excluded from patents, such as business methods and mental acts. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others from making, using, selling, or distributing the patented invention without permission.\n\nCopyright is a legal right created by the law of a country that grants the creator of an original work exclusive rights for its use and distribution. This is usually only for a limited time. The exclusive rights are not absolute but limited by limitations and exceptions to copyright law, including fair use. A major limitation on copyright is that copyright protects only the original expression of ideas, and not the underlying ideas themselves.\n\nA trademark or trade mark is a distinctive sign or indicator used by an individual, business organization, or other legal entity to identify that the products or services to consumers with which the trademark appears originate from a unique source, and to distinguish its products or services from those of other entities.\n\nTrademarks can act as a form of consumer protection that lowers the transaction costs between a buyer and seller who are not personally acquainted.\n\nGovernments have granted monopolies to forms of copy prevention. In the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, for example, the proprietary Macrovision copy prevention technology is required for analog video recorders. Though other forms of copy prevention aren't prohibited, requiring Macrovision effectively gives it a monopoly and prevents more effective copy prevention methods from being developed.\n\nOpponents of government-granted monopoly often point out that such a firm is able to set its pricing and production policies without fear of breeding potential competition. They argue that this causes inefficiencies in the market place, such as unnecessarily high prices to consumers for the good or service being supplied. It has been argued that government-imposed price caps might avert this problem.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "17448", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17448", "title": "Kuwaiti oil fires", "text": "Kuwaiti oil fires\n\nThe Kuwaiti oil fires were caused by Iraqi military forces setting fire to a reported 605 to 732 oil wells along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as oil lakes and fire trenches, as part of a scorched earth policy while retreating from Kuwait in 1991 due to the advances of Coalition military forces in the Persian Gulf War. The fires were started in January and February 1991, and the first well fires were extinguished in early April 1991, with the last well capped on November 6, 1991.\n\nThe dispute between Iraq and Kuwait over alleged slant-drilling in the Rumaila oil field was one of the reasons for Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.\n\nIn addition, Kuwait had been producing oil above treaty limits established by OPEC. By the eve of the Iraqi invasion, Kuwait had set production quotas to almost , which coincided with a sharp drop in the price of oil. By the summer of 1990, Kuwaiti overproduction had become a serious point of contention with Iraq.\n\nSome analysts have speculated that one of Saddam Hussein's main motivations in invading Kuwait was to punish the ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait for not stopping its policy of overproduction, as well as his reasoning behind the destruction of said wells.\n\nIt is also hypothesized that Iraq decided to destroy the oil fields to achieve a military advantage, believing the intense smoke plumes serving as smoke screens created by the burning oil wells would inhibit Coalition offensive air strikes, foil allied precision guided weapons and spy satellites, and could screen Iraq’s military movements. Furthermore, it is thought that Iraq’s military leaders may have regarded the heat, smoke, and debris from hundreds of burning oil wells as presenting a formidable area denial obstacle to Coalition forces. The onset of the oil well destruction supports this military dimension to the sabotage of the wells; for example, during the early stage of the Coalition air campaign, the number of oil wells afire was relatively small but the number increased dramatically in late February with the arrival of the ground war.\n\nThe Iraqi military combat engineers also released oil into low-lying areas for defensive purposes against infantry and mechanized units along Kuwait’s southern border, by constructing several \"fire trenches\" roughly 1 kilometer long, 3 meters wide, and 3 meters deep to impede the advance of Coalition ground forces.\n\nThe military use of the land based fires should also be seen in context with the coinciding, deliberate, sea based Gulf War oil spill, the apparent strategic goal of which was to foil a potential amphibious landing by U.S. Marines.\n\nAs an international coalition under United States command assembled in anticipation of an invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, the Iraqi regime decided to destroy as much of Kuwait's oil reserves and infrastructure as possible before withdrawing from that country. As early as December 1990, Iraqi forces placed explosive charges on Kuwaiti oil wells. The wells were systematically sabotaged beginning on January 16, 1991, when the allies commenced air strikes against Iraqi targets. On February 8, satellite images detected the first smoke from burning oil wells. The number of oil fires peaked between February 22 and 24, when the allied ground offensive began.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's report to Congress, \"the retreating Iraqi army set fire to or damaged over 700 oil wells, storage tanks, refineries, and facilities in Kuwait.\" Estimates placed the number of oil well fires from 605 to 732. A further thirty-four wells had been destroyed by heavy coalition bombing in January. The Kuwait Petroleum Company's estimate as of September 1991 was that there had been 610 fires, out of a total of 749 facilities damaged or on fire along with an unspecified number of oil filled low-lying areas, such as \"oil lakes\" and \"fire trenches\". These fires constituted approximately 50% of the total number of oil well fires in the history of the petroleum industry, and temporarily damaged or destroyed approximately 85% of the wells in every major Kuwaiti oil field.\n\nConcerted efforts to bring the fires and other damage under control began in April 1991. During the uncontrolled burning phase from February to April, various sources estimated that the ignited wellheads burnt through between four and six million barrels of crude oil, and between seventy and one hundred million cubic meters of natural gas per day. Seven months later, 441 facilities had been brought under control, while 308 remained uncontrolled. The last well was capped on November 6, 1991. The total amount of oil burned is generally estimated at about one billion barrels of the entire one hundred four billion supply. Almost one in every 100 barrels was destroyed forever. Daily global oil consumption in 2015 is about 91.4 million barrels; the oil lost to combustion would last 11 days at modern usage rates.\n\nOn March 21, 1991, a Royal Saudi Air Force C-130H crashed in heavy smoke due to the Kuwaiti oil fires on approach to Ras Mishab Airport, Saudi Arabia. 92 Senegalese soldiers and 6 Saudi crew members were killed, the largest accident among Coalition forces.\n\nThe smoke screening was also used by Iraqi anti-armor forces to a successful extent in the Battle of Phase Line Bullet, having aided in achieving the element of surprise against advancing Bradley (IFV)s, along with increasing the general fog of war.\n\nThe fires burned out of control because of the dangers of sending in firefighting crews during the war. Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells and military demining was necessary before the fires could be put out. Around of oil were lost each day. Eventually, privately contracted crews extinguished the fires, at a total cost of US$1.5 billion to Kuwait. By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately ten months, causing widespread pollution.\n\nThe fires have been linked with what was later deemed Gulf War Syndrome, a chronic disorder afflicting military veterans and civilian workers that include fatigue, muscle pain, and cognitive problems; however, studies have indicated that the firemen who capped the wells did not report any of the symptoms that the soldiers experienced. The causes of Gulf War Syndrome have yet to be been determined.\n\nFrom the perspective of ground forces, apart from the occasional \"oil rain\" experienced by troops very close to spewing wells, one of the more commonly experienced effects of the oil field fires were the ensuing smoke plumes which rose into the atmosphere and then precipitated or fell out of the air via dry deposition and by rain. The pillar-like plumes frequently broadened and joined up with other smoke plumes at higher altitudes, producing a cloudy grey overcast effect, as only about 10% of all the fires corresponding with those that originated from \"oil lakes\" produced pure black soot filled plumes, 25% of the fires emitted white to grey plumes, while the remainder emitted plumes with colors between grey and black. For example, one Gulf War veteran stated:\n\nA paper published in 2000 analyzed the degree of exposure by troops to particulate matter, which included soot but the paper focused more-so on silica sand, which can produce silicosis. The paper included troop medical records, and in its conclusion: \"A literature review indicated negligible to nonexistent health risk from other inhaled particulate material(other than silica) during the Gulf War\".\n\nThe burning wells needed to be extinguished as, without active efforts, Kuwait would lose billions of dollars in oil revenues. It was predicted that the fires would burn from two to five years before losing pressure and going out on their own, optimists estimating two years and pessimists estimating five while the majority estimated three years until this occurred.\n\nThe companies responsible for extinguishing the fires initially were Bechtel, Red Adair Company (now sold off to Global Industries of Louisiana), Boots and Coots, and Wild Well Control. Safety Boss was the fourth company to arrive but ended up extinguishing and capping the most wells of any other company: 180 of the 600. Other companies including Cudd Well/Pressure Control, Neal Adams Firefighters, and Kuwait Wild Well Killers were also contracted.\n\nAccording to Larry H. Flak, a petroleum engineer for Boots and Coots International Well Control, 90% of all the 1991 fires in Kuwait were put out with nothing but sea water, sprayed from powerful hoses at the base of the fire. The water supply to the arid desert region was supplied by re-purposing the oil pipelines that prior to the arson attack, pumped oil to the Persian Gulf, the pipeline was mildly damaged and once repaired its flow was reversed to pump Persian gulf seawater to the burning oil wells. The extinguishing rate was approximately 1 every 7–10 days at the start of efforts but then with experience gained and the removal of the mine fields that surrounded the burning wells, the rate increased to 2 or more per day.\n\nFor stubborn oil well fires, the use of a gas turbine to blast a large volume of water at high velocity at the fire proved popular with firefighters in Kuwait and was brought to the region by Hungarians equipped with MiG-21 engines mounted originally on a T-34 (later replaced with T-55) tank, called Big wind. It extinguished 9 fires in 43 days.\n\nIn fighting a fire at a directly vertical spewing wellhead, high explosives, such as dynamite were used to create a blast wave that pushes the burning fuel and local atmospheric oxygen away from the well. (This is a similar principle to blowing out a candle.) The flame is removed and the fuel can continue to spill out without igniting. Generally, explosives were placed within 55 gallon drums, the explosives surrounded by fire retardant chemicals, and then the drums are wrapped with insulating material with a horizontal crane being used to bring the drum as close to the burning area as possible.\n\nThe firefighting teams titled their occupation as \"Operation Desert Hell\" after Operation Desert Storm.\n\nThe fires were the subject of a 1992 IMAX documentary film, \"Fires of Kuwait\", which was nominated for an Academy Award. The film includes footage of the Hungarian team using their jet turbine extinguisher.\n\nLessons of Darkness is a 1992 film by director Werner Herzog that explores of the ravaged oil fields of post-Gulf War Kuwait.\n\nBetchel Corporation produced a short documentary titled \"Kuwait: Bringing Back the Sun\" that summarizes and focuses upon the fire fighting efforts, which were dubbed the Al-Awda (Arabic for \"The Return\") project.\n\nImmediately following Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, predictions were made of an environmental disaster stemming from Iraqi threats to blow up captured Kuwaiti oil wells. Speculation ranging from a nuclear winter type scenario, to heavy acid rain and even short term immediate global warming were presented at the World Climate Conference in Geneva that November.\n\nOn January 10, 1991, a paper appearing in the Journal \"Nature\", stated Paul Crutzen's calculations that the setting alight of the Kuwait oil wells would produce a \"nuclear winter\", with a cloud of smoke covering half of the Northern Hemisphere after 100 days had passed and beneath the cloud, temperatures would be reduced by 5-10 Celsius. This was followed by articles printed in the Wilmington morning star and the Baltimore Sun newspapers in mid to late January 1991, with the popular TV scientist personality of the time, Carl Sagan, who was also the co-author of the first few nuclear winter papers along with Richard P. Turco, John W. Birks, Alan Robock and Paul Crutzen together collectively stated that they expected catastrophic nuclear winter like effects with continental sized impacts of \"sub-freezing\" temperatures as a result if the Iraqis went through with their threats of igniting 300 to 500 pressurized oil wells and they burned for a few months.\n\nLater when Operation Desert Storm had begun, Dr. S. Fred Singer and Carl Sagan discussed the possible environmental impacts of the Kuwaiti petroleum fires on the ABC News program \"Nightline\". Sagan again argued that some of the effects of the smoke could be similar to the effects of a nuclear winter, with smoke lofting into the stratosphere, a region of the atmosphere beginning around above sea level at Kuwait, resulting in global effects and that he believed the net effects would be very similar to the explosion of the Indonesian volcano Tambora in 1815, which resulted in the year 1816 being known as the \"Year Without a Summer\".\n\nHe reported on initial modeling estimates that forecast impacts extending to south Asia, and perhaps to the northern hemisphere as well. Singer, on the other hand, said that calculations showed that the smoke would go to an altitude of about and then be rained out after about three to five days and thus the lifetime of the smoke would be limited. Both height estimates made by Singer and Sagan turned out to be wrong, albeit with Singer's narrative being closer to what transpired, with the comparatively minimal atmospheric effects remaining limited to the Persian Gulf region, with smoke plumes, in general, lofting to about and a few times as high as .\n\nAlong with Singer's televised critique, Richard D. Small criticized the initial \"Nature\" paper in a reply on March 7, 1991 arguing along similar lines as Singer.\n\nSagan later conceded in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" that his prediction did not turn out to be correct: \"it \"was\" pitch black at noon and temperatures dropped 4–6 °C over the Persian Gulf, but not much smoke reached stratospheric altitudes and Asia was spared.\"\n\nAt the peak of the fires, the smoke absorbed 75 to 80% of the sun’s radiation. The particles rose to a maximum of , but were scavenged by cloud condensation nuclei from the atmosphere relatively quickly.\n\nSagan and his colleagues expected that a \"self-lofting\" of the sooty smoke would occur when it absorbed the sun's heat radiation, with little to no scavenging occurring, whereby the black particles of soot would be heated by the sun and lifted/lofted higher and higher into the air, thereby injecting the soot into the stratosphere where it would take years for the sun blocking effect of this aerosol of soot to fall out of the air, and with that, catastrophic ground level cooling and agricultural impacts in Asia and possibly the Northern Hemisphere as a whole.\n\nIn retrospect, it is now known that smoke from the Kuwait oil fires only affected the weather pattern throughout the Persian Gulf and surrounding region during the periods that the fires were burning in 1991, with lower atmospheric winds blowing the smoke along the eastern half of the Arabian Peninsula, and cities such as Dhahran and Riyadh, and countries such as Bahrain experienced days with smoke filled skies and carbon soot rainout/fallout.\n\nThus the immediate consequence of the arson sabotage was a dramatic regional decrease in air quality, causing respiratory problems for many Kuwaitis and those in neighboring countries.\n\nAccording to the 1992 study from Peter Hobbs and Lawrence Radke, daily emissions of sulfur dioxide (which can generate acid rain) from the Kuwaiti oil fires were 57% of that from electric utilities in the United States, the emissions of carbon dioxide were 2% of global emissions and emissions of soot reached 3400 metric tons per day.\n\nIn a paper in the DTIC archive, published in 2000, it states that \"Calculations based on smoke from Kuwaiti oil fires in May and June 1991 indicate that combustion efficiency was about 96% in producing carbon dioxide. While, with respect to the incomplete combustion fraction, Smoke particulate matter accounted for 2% of the fuel burned, of which 0.4% was soot.\"[With the remaining 2%, being oil that did not undergo any initial combustion].\n\nPeter V. Hobbs also narrated a short amateur documentary titled \"Kuwait Oil Fires\" that followed the University of Washington/UW's \"Cloud and Aerosol Research Group\" as they flew through, around and above the smoke clouds and took samples, measurements, and video of the smoke clouds in their Convair C-131(N327UW) Aerial laboratory.\n\nAlthough scenarios that predicted long-lasting environmental impacts on a global atmospheric level due to the burning oil sources did not transpire, long-lasting ground level oil spill impacts were detrimental to the environment regionally.\n\nForty-six oil wells are estimated to have gushed, and before efforts to cap them began, they were releasing approximately 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil per day, with the last gusher being capped occurring in the latter days of October 1991.\n\nThe Kuwaiti Oil Minister estimated between twenty-five and fifty million barrels of unburned oil from damaged facilities pooled to create approximately 300 oil lakes, that contaminated around 40 million tons of sand and earth. The mixture of desert sand, unignited oil spilled and soot generated by the burning oil wells formed layers of hard \"tarcrete\", which covered nearly five percent of Kuwait's land mass.\nCleaning efforts were led by the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research and the Arab Oil Co., who tested a number of technologies including the use of petroleum-degrading bacteria on the oil lakes.\n\nVegetation in most of the contaminated areas adjoining the oil lakes began recovering by 1995, but the dry climate has also partially solidified some of the lakes. Over time the oil has continued to sink into the sand, with potential consequences for Kuwait's small groundwater resources.\n\nThe land based Kuwaiti oil spill surpassed the Lakeview Gusher, which spilled nine million pounds in 1910, as the largest oil spill in recorded history.\n\nSix to eight million barrels of oil were directly spilled into the Persian Gulf, which became known as the Gulf War oil spill.\n\nDuring the second US invasion of Iraq in 2003, approximately 40 oil wells were set on fire in the Persian gulf within Iraqi territory, ostensibly to once again hinder the invasion.\n\nThe \"Kuwait Wild Well Killers\", who successfully extinguished 41 of the Kuwait oil well fires in 1991, used their experience to tackle blazes in the Iraqi Rumaila oilfields in 2003.\n\n\n\n"}

It was the fourth series in Dick Wolf's successful \"Law & Order\" franchise. The show's almost exclusive focus was on the criminal trial of the accused, showing both the prosecution's and defense's preparation for trial, as well as the trial itself. The series premiered on Thursday, March 3, 2005, and ended on January 21, 2006. Its regular time slot was Fridays 10/9 p.m. ET on NBC. The last episode aired on Court TV months after the series' cancellation.\n\n\"Trial by Jury\" focuses on criminal legal procedures and preparation that are rarely depicted on other \"Law & Order\" series, such as jury selection, deliberations in the jury room, as well as jury research and mock trials prepared by the defense to use psychological studies and socioeconomic status profiling to their advantage. The episodes usually start with a witness or victim's personal account of a crime. This is a departure from the other \"Law & Order\" series, which usually begin by depicting either the actual crime or its discovery/reporting by civilians. The show progresses on from that point, showing how both sides develop their strategies for winning the case. In addition, a few episodes show jury deliberations. The show develops the judges as characters, showing scenes of them conferring with each other and reusing the same judges in multiple episodes.\n\nThe series follows Bureau Chief Tracey Kibre (Bebe Neuwirth), an Executive A.D.A. assigned to Manhattan's homicide division. Kibre's team, including Detective Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) and A.D.A. Kelly Gaffney (Amy Carlson), follows up on leads and interview witnesses, as well as participating in trials, during which both sides examine witnesses and give arguments. Similarly, the defense's preparation varies from episode to episode, running the gamut from testing arguments in front of jury focus groups to deal-making between co-defendants. Several pretrial meetings are held where some procedural issue is argued and ruled on.\n\n\n\nNBC announced on May 16, 2005, that \"Trial by Jury\" would not be returning for the 2005–2006 fall television season. The rival CBS procedural \"Numbers\" debuted in the midseason in late January 2005 and consistently beat NBC's \"Medical Investigation\" in the ratings, sending the latter show into hiatus and eventual cancellation, freeing up the time slot for \"Law & Order: Trial by Jury\". Despite \"Trial by Jury\"s pedigree, \"Numb3rs\" ratings remained strong, often beating \"Trial by Jury\" in both overall and key demographic ratings.\n\n\"Trial by Jury\" was the first series of the \"Law & Order\" franchise to be canceled, although \"TV Guide\" reported at one point that NBC had reconsidered its decision and would pick up the series once again, or hand it off to Turner Network Television (TNT), which also airs reruns of the original series. The sets were reused by a series Wolf produced for NBC entitled \"Conviction\" which premiered Friday, March 3, 2006, lasting only one season before cancellation. In an October 2005 interview with the Associated Press, Wolf stated that NBC had assured him \"Trial by Jury\" would return for the fall of 2005, but had \"blindsided\" him by canceling it, instead.\n\nCourt TV (now TruTV) re-aired the entire series, including the episode \"Eros in the Upper Eighties\", which never aired on NBC before the show's cancellation. TNT has aired the episode \"Skeleton\" on occasion, as the conclusion to the original series episode \"Tombstone\".\n\nOn April 25, 2006, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released \"Law & Order: Trial by Jury – The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1.\n\n"}

Ellis gained notoriety when, as a fighter pilot in the Vietnam War, he was shot down, captured, and spent 5 ½ years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi and surrounding areas with former Presidential candidate and Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and others. His capture occurred on November 7, 1967, and he was released on March 14, 1973. He was one of the youngest, junior members in the camps. Ellis is an international speaker and consultant on the subjects of leadership and human performance, organizational integrity, operational effectiveness, and personal accountability. He frequently consults with various organizations—from small businesses to Fortune 500 organizations on these subjects.\nEllis’ latest book, \"Engage with Honor: Building a Culture of Courageous Accountability\" published in 2016 and his last award-winning book, \"Leading with Honor: Leadership Lessons from the Hanoi Hilton\" published in 2012, shares his POW experience and the leadership principles that helped him and his compatriots resist, survive, and return with honor. His previous book, \"Leading Talents, Leading Teams\", was published by Northfield Publishing and shares in-depth team concepts on how to lead and manage based on individual, innate gifts and talents. Additionally, Lee co-authored three books and workbooks on career planning.\n\nEllis was born in Commerce, Georgia, to Leon and Molene Ellis. His father was a food service manager at the University of Georgia, and his mother was a middle school science teacher. He has one brother, Robert Ellis. Ellis had early memories of being interested in airplanes and flying. He recalls a moment at 5-years old when he climbed on a World War II airplane in a local park and told his parents this is what he wanted to do when he grew up. His parents encouraged his early interest in flying. He went to Ila Elementary and Commerce High School; and though he maintained good grades, he admittedly was not a disciplined student. He lettered in multiple sports including football, basketball, and baseball and was a good athlete.\n\nAfter high school, Ellis attended the University of Georgia in Athens and enrolled in Air Force ROTC. He graduated with a B.A. degree in History while pursuing his passion for a military aviation career. Upon graduation from the University of Georgia in 1965, he was selected as a Distinguished Graduate of AFROTC and was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force.\n\nEllis entered pilot training program at Moody Air Force Base, Valdosta, Georgia. Fifty-three weeks later he received his Wings and an assignment to combat training in the F-4C Phantom fighter bomber with follow-on orders to Vietnam.\nIn addition to his academic achievements mentioned above, Ellis also earned graduated from the Armed Forces Staff College and the Air War College, and earned a Master of Science Degree in Counseling and Human Development from Troy University in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nAfter arriving in Vietnam, Ellis was assigned to execute bombing raids in North Vietnam, one of the heaviest guarded regions of the country. On his 53rd mission, he and aircraft commander, Captain Ken Fisher, received serious damage to their F-4C Phantom aircraft. Both men had to eject from the fighter jet and were immediately captured on the ground when they landed with their parachutes. After two weeks of traveling through various regions in a Vietnamese military vehicle, they arrived at the Hoa Loa Prison in Hanoi, Vietnam (also known as the Hanoi Hilton). Hoa Loa was an old French Bastille prison fortified strongly to keep prisoners from escaping. For the next 9 months, Lee and three other comrades shared 6'x7.5' cell.\n\nOver the next 5 ½ years, Ellis' described his POW experience as \"moments of boredom interrupted by stark moments of terror.\" In addition to physically torturing prisoners for information, the prison would broadcast anti-American propaganda several times a day throughout the entire camp as a means of breaking their spirit and confidence. Ellis and his comrades began using several forms of subversive communication to stay in touch with each other without being caught. Ellis became one of the key communicators in the camps using a tap code system used by American World War II POWs in Germany. (This was also highlighted in Arthur Koestler's book about the Soviet Gulags, \"Darkness at Noon\"). The code uses a 5x5 matrix composed of the 26 letters of the alphabet, with K and C being the same tap code. For example, the word \"Hi\" would two taps, then three taps for \"H\"; and two taps, then four taps for \"I\". The POWs tapped letters and words through the thick walls to form messages that each cell would pass along to the next.\n\nSome of Ellis' fellow senior ranking officers in the camps were Colonel Robbie Risner USAF, CAPT Jeremiah Denton USN, and CAPT Jim Stockdale USN. In the prison camps, frequently the senior-ranking officers received the first and most harsh treatment in an effort to obtain propaganda and information. Much of the torture abuse was aimed at discouraging the senior officers from carrying out leadership duties.\n\nPrisoners of war were released from the camps in order of capture through Operation Homecoming. On March 14, 1973, Lee and several comrades, include Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), were flown from Vietnam to Clark Air Base, Philippines. From there, Ellis and others eventually landed at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama where he was reunited with his family. Ellis was single at the time of his capture.\n\nAfter repatriation he returned to flying duties with increasing positions of leadership. Rising to the rank of colonel before retirement, Ellis's assignments included duty as a pilot, flight instructor, staff officer, chief of flight standardization and evaluation, flying squadron commander, and supervisor in higher education. He supervised, educated, and trained officers for the last 17 years of his U.S. Air Force career. Ellis served as the Vice Commandant of the Squadron Officer School, the Air Force's leadership school for captains. He completed his Air Force career as Professor of Aerospace Studies and Commander of Air Force ROTC at the University of Georgia, retiring with almost twenty-five years of service.\n\nEllis is a command pilot whose decorations include the Silver Star with one Oak Leaf Cluster; the Legion of Merit with one Oak Leaf Cluster; the Bronze Star with Valor Device; the Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters; the Purple Heart; the Air Medal with eight Oak Leaf Clusters; and the Prisoner of War Medal. In addition, he was awarded four Air Force Commendation Medals and four Meritorious Service Medals for performance excellence. He retired after 24 years of service with the rank of colonel. He was selected in 1975 as the Air Force nominee for the U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce's \"Ten Outstanding Men of the Year\" Award.\n\nBased on Ellis' previous education and experience with behavioral assessment and human development, he accepted the role as Director of Career/Life Pathways from 1990 – 1998.

The 'Haight' was a neighborhood of run-down turn-of-the-20th-century housing that was the center of San Francisco's counterculture in the 1960s.\n\nThe major instigators of the rally were Allen Cohen and artist Michael Bowen, the creators of the \"San Francisco Oracle\", which first hit the streets in September 1966. The occasion was the banning of LSD, by the California legislature in Sacramento, an enactment which virtually created a neighborhood of outlaws in the Haight, where 'acid' was a staple of community culture. Since the new law was to go into effect on October 6, 1966, Cohen and others related the event to the number of the Beast of \"Revelation\". On a more serious level, busts for drugs were ramping up locally and on the national level, and confrontations between the hippie communes and the local police were getting more intense and led to street protests and rioting, followed by neighborhood curfews. A better form of protest, more suited to hippie culture was needed.\n\n\"Without confrontation,\" said Allen Cohen, \"we wanted to create a celebration of innocence. We were not guilty of using illegal substances. We were celebrating transcendental consciousness. The beauty of the universe. The beauty of being.\"\n\nPosters advertising the event invited participants to \"Bring the color gold... Bring photos of personal saints and gurus and heroes of the underground... Bring children... Flowers... Flutes... Drums... Feathers... Bands... Beads... Banners, flags, incense, chimes, gongs, cymbals, symbols, costumes, joy.\"\n\nThousands showed up for the event, read a \"prophecy of a declaration of independence\" written by Cohen, after which many placed a tab of acid on their tongues and swallowed in unison. Music was provided by the Grateful Dead and Janis Joplin, both invited to play by Michael Bowen for free. Ken Kesey was on hand with the Merry Pranksters in the legendary bus.\n\nThe Love Pageant Rally drew several thousand people. It was a warm-up for the Human Be-In the following January, which brought 30,000 together and established media attention to hippie culture that then led to The Summer of Love.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "45611529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=45611529", "title": "Next Mars Orbiter", "text": "Next Mars Orbiter\n\nThe Next Mars Orbiter (NeMO, earlier known as the Mars 2022 orbiter) is a proposed NASA Mars communications satellite with high-resolution imaging payload and two solar-electric ion thrusters.\n\nThe orbiter was initially proposed to be launched in September 2022 to link ground controllers with rovers and landers and extend mapping capabilities expected to be lost when the \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" and \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" stop functioning, but officials elected to focus on flying a sample-return mission first and incorporate a Mars telecom orbiter in that mission architecture, now envisioned for the late 2020s.\n\nKey features under study include solar electric ion drive engines, better solar arrays, and broadband laser communications (optic communication) between Earth and Mars.\n\nThe orbiter is conceptually similar to the Mars Telecommunications Orbiter, canceled in 2005, and could be a technology precursor for a future round-trip sample return mission and human expeditions to Mars. Robert Lock is leading the concept studies for the 2022 orbiter.\n\nConcern in NASA is that the currently used relay satellites, \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" and \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\", may stop functioning, resulting in the need to press the \"MAVEN\" science orbiter into use as a backup telecommunications relay. Since the highly elliptical orbit of \"MAVEN\" limits its usefulness as a relay for surface operations, NASA will lower its orbit from to between altitude, where it can serve as a relay while continuing its science mission.\n\nAnother suggested feature under study is \"the sample rendezvous capture and return capability.\" The samples cached by the Mars 2020 rover would be placed in Mars orbit by a future Mars ascent vehicle. From there, the orbiter would rendezvous, transfer the samples into a capsule and send it back to Earth.\n\nThe proposed orbiter would be propelled with two solar-electric ion thrusters; one engine would be active while the other one would be a spare. Electrical power to the engines would be provided by advanced solar arrays that generate 20 kW.\n\nAn ion engine would give the spacecraft significant orbital flexibility for long-term support of future missions, opportunistic flybys of Phobos and Deimos, as well as the added capability of orbit support—rendezvous and capture—for a sample return mission. An ion engine would also allow access to multiple latitudes and altitudes to optimize relay contacts.\n\n\nThe orbiter mission has been suggested by the Planetary Science Decadal Survey to be one of three missions comprising the proposed Mars Sample Return (MSR) campaign. Samples would be collected and cached by the first mission, the Mars 2020 rover, and would be left on the surface of Mars for possible later retrieval. The orbiter would be launched on a medium-class vehicle, reaching Mars in about nine months and set to aerobrake down to a circular orbit over six to nine months. The third mission of the proposed MSR campaign, the lander, would nominally be launched two years after the orbiter launch. The lander would deploy a \"fetch rover\" to retrieve the sample caches. A container holding the samples would be launched by a Mars ascent vehicle (MAV) and placed in a 500 km orbit comparable with the new orbiter and perform a rendezvous while in Mars orbit. The container would be transferred to an Earth entry vehicle (EEV) which would bring it to Earth, enter the atmosphere under a parachute and hard-land for retrieval and analyses in specially designed safe laboratories.\n\nSome NASA officials consider the Mars 2022 orbiter an \"essential orbital support for sample return\", \"significant\" in maintaining the Martian communications infrastructure, and desirable for the continuity in remote sensing. The President's FY2017 Budget provided $10 million to begin early conceptual work on the proposed Mars orbiter. In July 2016 the Jet Propulsion Laboratory awarded five $400,000 sub-contracts to conduct concept studies. The five engineering companies are Boeing, Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Orbital ATK, and Space Systems/Loral.\n\nHowever, in August 2017, Jim Green of NASA's Planetary Science Division stated that a 2022 launch for the orbiter was \"probably off the table\", as it would be too difficult to assemble an orbiter with all of the desired features in that time frame. Jim Watzin of NASA's Mars Exploration Program stated in September 2017 that the orbiter may have to be cancelled, citing that \"the likelihood of all of the relay orbiters failing is so low that no more investments are needed for that purpose.\"\n\nIn February 2018, NASA announced that it was moving ahead with plans to alter the orbit of the \"MAVEN\" orbiter to have it serve as a communications relay. It will be lowered to altitude, where it can serve as a relay while allowing it to continue its science mission. In March 2018, NASA officials decided that the ageing \"Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\" (MRO) will be managed such that it will continue service for about ten more years, and the program will now focus its resources on flying a sample-return mission first. The \"2001 Mars Odyssey\" orbiter will also be managed to continue operating until about 2025. A new Mars relay orbiter is likely to take part in the sample-return architecture envisioned for the late 2020s.\n"}
{"id": "35810434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35810434", "title": "Orange Man (advertisement)", "text": "Orange Man (advertisement)\n\nOrange Man is a British television advertisement for the soft drink Tango Orange. Created by advertising agency HHCL (Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners), a longtime collaborator of Tango who would go on to create many of their advertisements, the advertisement was produced in 1991 and aired in 1992, and became the first in the brand's \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\" campaign that would continue until 1996 before returning for several years in the 2000s.\n\nThe advertisement features an orange man slapping a Tango drinker across the cheeks, a wacky metaphor for tasting Tango, and was intended as a reaction against the norm of \"cause and effect\" television advertising at the time was largely focused on scenarios where peoples lives were improved by the product being advertised. \"Orange Man\" caused controversy after reports of injuries when children began copying the events of the advertisement in school playgrounds, and was subsequently banned, with two other versions of \"Orange Man\" replacing it, both showing different scenarios aside from slapping.\n\nDespite the controversy, it contributed to a boost of sales by more than a third, and has gained acclaim in later years, even featuring and ranking highly in several lists of the greatest advertisements ever made. A Channel 4/\"The Sunday Times\" poll in 2000 named \"Orange Man\" the third best advertisement of all time. It has also been credited as pioneering viral marketing and guerrilla marketing. Different commentators have named it the best advertisement for Tango and the best advertisement created by HHCL. \"Orange Man\" precedes other Tango advertisements that have been banned, and has been parodied several times.\n\nThe advertisement begins with three young men standing outside a fruit shop or cornershop. One of them takes a sip out of a can of Tango he is holding. The voice-over of \"commentators\" Ralph and Tony (voiced by Hugh Dennis and Ray Wilkins) appear. Ralph says \"oh, I think we could use a video replay here\" and the footage of the man drinking the Tango is \"rewound\" (with the visual effect of a tape recorded being rewound on screen) to some ten seconds before he drinks the Tango, for a \"replay\". Then, a man painted completely orange (Peter Geeves) comes onto the scene, who runs around the men and then taps the Tango drinker on the back.\n\nThe Tango drinker turns around, and the orange man slaps him across the cheeks, and then runs off, leaving the drinker startled, although the other men beside the drinker do not observe or respond to the orange man and the slap. Ralph becomes excited as he reveals this to be \"Tango taste sensation\" and asks Tony to rewind the clip again to the same point as before, this time showing the orange man sprint out from behind a pillar box and shows the same events as before with Ralph and Tony providing commentary. The advertisement ends with the drinker looking at his Tango can in question, followed by a behind shot of the Tango can on top of the orange man's head, which bears the slogan \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\". A deep male voice (Gil Scott-Heron) says the slogan at the same time.\n\nAt the time of the advertisement's production, successful soft drink television advertising was dominated by Coca-Cola; Trevor Robinson, co-creator of \"Orange Man\", recalled that \"Coca-Cola was the big name in soft-drink advertising then. Nothing was taking on the Coke ads; nothing came close.\" Robinson recalled that \"cause and effect advertising\" was very popular on British advertisement at the time, which he described as advertisements where \"you come into contact with the product and somehow it changes your life for the better, was a big trend.\" The most recent television advertising campaign for Tango at the time was a series of advertisements featuring the slogan \"the whole fruit\" that had aired from 1987–1991. These advertisements featured musical soundtracks throughout and lacked the surreal humour that would later dominate the soft drink's advertising from \"Orange Man\" onwards.\n\nBritvic, who had acquired the Tango brand in 1988, were looking to radicalize Tango's image and advertising. They hired London-based advertising agency Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury and Partners (HHCL) to create a brand new television advertisement for the brand, which would form the basis of a new advertising campaign. HHCL, who had been operating since 1987, had earned a reputation in the business for breaking several norms in advertising and established a avant-garde theme in 1989, when, in launching the direct banking service, First Direct, aired two advertisements simultaneously on ITV and Channel 4, interrupting an Audi advert, one offering an optimistic and the other a pessimistic view, and a number of short, surreal spots in which the visual had little or nothing to do with the message. \"Orange Man\" was created by HHCL, using their staff Trevor Robinson OBE as art director, Al Young as copywriter, John Leach as planner, Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry as creative directors and Matt Forrest as director. Production company Limelight also worked on the project. Robinson and Young were creative partners, and were \"pretty anti-advertising in [their] mindsets\" at the time because of their boredom and frustration with the industry norm of \"cause and effect advertising\", and were desperate to make a name for themselves after \"spending what felt like eons trying to get into a West End agency.\"\nRobinson said that the nucleus of their idea for \"Orange Man\" came as a reaction to cause and effect advertising, and that he and the team decided to focus on word of mouth as their media, which was a reaction to Coca-Cola's big budget dominance in soft drink advertising. He told Channel 4 in 2000 that the advertisement was \"meant to be taking the mickey out of other ads that were on the television at the time\", comparing it to coffee advertisements where \"they have a drink and go 'oh, whoopy' and flowers bloom,\" noting that \"Orange Man\" decided to \"express this in an really OTT fashion\". The idea for the advertisement originally started out as a joke, with Robinson recalling \"We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened.\" The idea to use commentators in the advert were taken from another idea they had for another advert, but they decided to mash the two ideas together, a \"cardinal sin in adland.\" One commentary considered the advertisement to be a \"riff on the sort of sports commentary Andy Gray with his video tapes and ranty shouting at the time.\"\n\nThe project, including research, lasted two to three months in 1991. The plot of the advertisement originally involved the orange man punching the Tango drinker in the mouth, as they were trying to make the advertisement as \"stupid\" and slapstick as possible; before they then changed the idea to the orange man kicking Tango drinker up the buttocks, but both ideas were deemed too aggressive, so their final idea of the orange man slapping the drinker across the cheeks, described by Robinson as a \"Morecambe and Wise-esque little tap on the cheeks,\" was used.\n\nThe team originally used American football commentators, but we were asked to make \"everything more British,\" so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' \"Eddie Waring-esque commentary\" was deliberately intended to contrasted with the \"dry and amusing delivery\" of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed. Robinson praised him, saying that he was a \"really good actor, and he was just the best at reacting to being hit, he never made a big deal out of it,\" calling his performance \"cool and dopey.\"\n\nThe orange man was portrayed by serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves; the advert's co-creator Al Young recalled that \"the guy we used [Geeves] was like a Shakespearean actor,\" and noted that out of all who auditioned for the role, \"he was the one who made [the creators] laugh the most,\" adding that the way he ran \"was surreal\". Robinson recalled, \"We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect.\" Geeves recalled in 2006, \"I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was at that point I thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'.\" The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming. Geeves himself was scared of hitting the finally chosen actor in the role of the Tango drinker too hard, though the actor did not mind, telling him a hard hit would \"make it look real\".\n\nRobinson and Young went to the shooting location–a park–to do a test film, which essentially involved them \"mucking about, 'Tangoing' each other;\" as they \"messed around\" they decided the \"little slap\" just wasn't powerful enough, so they exaggerated it; Robinson recalled that \"if you watch the ad, the Orange Man's arms go way back before he slaps the person in the face.\" Seminal American jazz poet Gil Scott-Heron was hired to perform the voice who says the slogan at the end because of \"his deep, charismatic voice;\" Scott-Heron was the first person to see the final advert, and, much to the relief of a fearful Robinson, he loved it.\n\nAlthough \"Orange Man\" was produced in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as ITV and Channel 4, where it became the first advertisement in the \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\" campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005. \"Orange Man\" was an instant success; Robinson recalled in 2015 that \"I first knew the ad was huge when I fell asleep on the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear a group of kids talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: 'I did that!'\"\n\nNonetheless, \"Orange Man\" soon sparked large controversy in the media and in public after it was discovered children had copied the events of the advertisement in playgrounds and injured themselves; Rupert Howell, a Tango advertisement executive, stated in 2000 that \"Orange Man\" \"sparked a playground craze\" where \"people used to go round sort of slapping each other and saying 'You've Been Tango'd', and it was all very entertaining and great fun. There were no problems until we got a phone call once from a surgeon who said 'look, I'm not the complaining type but I thought you'd like to know that I did an operation on a child this morning with a damaged ear drum, and I was wheeling him in to the operating table, and said to him 'what happened to you then?' and replied 'I got Tango'd.'\" As a result, Howell pulled the advertisement from television that afternoon, although other reports erroneously state that the advertisement was banned.\n\n\"Orange Man\" was replaced by two similar versions of the advertisement, the first of these instead showing the orange man putting his hand on the Tango drinker's mouth and kissing it, and the other, which came later, showing the Tango drinker simply running off as the orange man approaches him. The former version was noted by Howell to be \"just as good\", although presenter Phillip Schofield comically noted in a later commentary that \"happy kissing never really caught on.\" These later versions were also changed to incorporate the recently redesigned Tango Orange can.\n\nDespite the controversy, \"Orange Man\" was very successful at rising Tango's sales and profile, and sales of Tango Orange rose by more than a third following the airing of \"Orange Man\". Such was its success that in 2001, \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that the brand \"eclipsed\" the brand's better-known competitors due to the advertisement. The public received \"Orange Man\" with great acclaim, but regardless, at the time of its broadcast, television advertising tended to be very slick with \"beautiful scripting\" and big budgets, so most of the advertising industry did not enjoy \"Orange Man\", with one of the big advertising professionals, who has remained unspecified, calling it \"oik advertising.\" However, HHCL \"loved that\" and felt they were brave enough to \"do stuff that nobody else would do, or think about doing,\" with Robinsion rhapsodizing in an article he wrote in 2015 that \"I think that's what made the ad what it is. Now, years later, that's what makes my own agency what it is.\"\n\nDespite the original industry hostility, critical favour towards \"Orange Man\" has increased in later times and has gone on to become considered one of the greatest television advertisements of all time by numerous sources; in 2000, \"Orange Man\" was ranked at number 3 in Channel 4 and \"The Sunday Times\" poll of the \"100 Greatest TV Ads Ever.\" Channel 4 aired the final top 100 of the poll on 29 April 2000 as part of their \"100 Greatest\" series. In 2006, ITV ranked the advertisement ranked at number 5 in its list of \"ITV's Best Ads Ever 2\", a list of the top 20 television advertisements ever broadcast on the channel. In the commentary for the latter list, \"Orange Man\" is credited as a humorous precursor to happy slapping. Sarah McCartney referred to the advertisement in her 2011 book \"100 Great Branding Ideas: From Leading Companies Around the World\", where she comments that despite the controversy surrounding its slogan, \"the phrase had captured the public's imagination.\" In 2016, Ben Priest, founding partner and chief creative officer at communications agency adam&eveDDB, included the advert in his list of \"3 Great Ads I Had Nothing to Do With\", part of a series for \"Campaign Live\", where he said \"the hype it created and the fondness with which people remember the ad makes it one of the most successful of its time.\"\n\nIn 2013, \"The Guardian\" referred to Tango as the \"original gangster of viral marketing\", saying that \"Orange Man\" \"was all it took to engage viewers\", and that no \"Tango crusade since has managed to recapture that lightning in a 500ml bottle.\" Marketing Society's website The Library states that \"Orange Man\" is the reason why Tango is included in their list of the \"golden brands of 1992\". Furthermore, \"Campaign Live\" stated that \"no commercial better symbolized the creative iconoclasm of Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury during the early 90s\" than \"Orange Man\", and presenter Jenni Falconer said the advert was \"brilliant, and everybody loved it and everyone thought it was great.\" In Nicholas Kochan's 1997 book \"The World's Greatest Brands\", he wrote that the advertisement \"succeeded not only in entertaining its audience but also in communicating its taste attributes–the \"hit\" of real oranges,\" adding that \"the ad's fun scenarios of 'being hooked on Tango' have been extended into other promotions.\"\n\n\"Orange Man\" is also credited by Curveball Media for pioneering what would later become known as guerilla advertising, with Tim Delaney of Legas Delaney saying \"the whole point was that this radical, strong, full-of-attitude campaign worked – it shifted cans of fizzy pop in a way that got Britvic's rivals panicking. It also showed what potential there was in thinking of completely fresh ideas. And better than that – it became part of our culture.\" Trevor Robinson told \"The Guardian\" in 2015 that \"You can say 'Tango ad' to people and they still remember it. Some even dress up as the Orange Man today. That, for me, is what makes a piece of work great – when the general public take it on, play with it and it becomes theirs.\" In the mid-1990s, \"Orange Man\" appeared on the brand's promotional VHS tape \"Now That's What I Call Tango 3\", which contained multiple advertisements for the brand from \"Orange Man\" until the publication of the VHS tape.\n\n\"Orange Man\" was the first of Tango advertisements produced by HHCL, who would work with the brand for many years after, and is now credited as the first of the brand's controversies, as later advertisements for the brand were also banned; in 2000 a \"Tango Megaphone\" advertisement was banned for fears it provoked bullying. This advertisement also had a replacement advert produced, the first time Tango had done this since \"Orange Man\", although this was not an altered version of the original \"Tango Megaphone\" advertisement, but instead a short advertisement satirising the ban. \"Orange Man\" is considered one of two definitive Tango television advertisements, alongside \"St George\", also produced by HHCL, which aired in 1996 in promotion of the brand's Blackcurrant variant, and is the only Tango advertisement besides \"Orange Man\" to feature in lists of the best television advertisements of all time.\n\n\"Orange Man\" was parodied in a sketch from a 1992 episode of \"The Real McCoy\" that also parodies the assault of Rodney King, showing the Tango drinker, an actor portraying King, getting assaulted by the Los Angeles Police Department after drinking a \"Tango'd\" can in his car, ending with the slogan \"You Know When You Have Been L.A.P.D'd\". Tango themselves later parodied the slap in a 1997 advertisement, \"Vote Orange Tango\", which was a parody of a party political broadcast that was broadcast in the run-up to the 1997 general election; the advertisement sees a mock politician criticising the flavours of the drink that were not orange before praising the orange flavour, with a man painted orange later slapping the politician's cheeks several times with an orange fish as part of the politician's parade to celebrate the orange flavour.\n\n\"Orange Man\" marked the debut for the highly successful \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\" television campaign, created by HHCL throughout its first run, which would continue in its first run until 1996. Although \"Orange Man\" was the most notorious of the advertisements, other advertisements in the campaign also proved to be controversial and were banned, including \"Exploding Pensioner\" (1993) which offended pensioners and several charity groups such as Age Concern, \"Scotsman\" (1994)–which featured a legless, blue afro-sporting orange Scotsman–for scaring children, and another 1994 advertisement featuring a man's head pop off from his body, which was banned during children's programming for also being too frightening. Nonetheless, by 1994, the campaign had helped Tango double its share on the soft drinks market. One commentary later said \"While it's a matter of debate as to how offensive these ads were deemed, as opposed to how good HHCL were at pretending they were offensive and exploiting the publicity, the phrase 'You Know When You've Been Tango'd' wasn't going anywhere for the next decade.\"\n\nIn May 2002, the \"You Know When You've Been Tango'd\" campaign relaunched with the advertisements \"Helmet\" and \"Porcupine\" on the tenth anniversary of the campaign and \"Orange Man\", although this campaign was created by Chi instead of HHCL, who ended their ten-year relationship the year before. However, these advertisements were intended to hark back to the \"irreverent orange hit\" motif established in \"Orange Man\". In 2004, the \"Pipes\" advertisement from the campaign, which drew comparisons to \"Orange Man\" in the media, was banned, becoming the last Tango advertisement to do so; however the ban was not because children had already injured themselves, but because there were fears that children were going to. In August 2006, Tango's main rival drink, Fanta, aired an advertisement with similarly saw a man being slapped, however unlike \"Orange Man\" it escaped being banned.\n\n"}
{"id": "2014938", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2014938", "title": "Polly (Nirvana song)", "text": "Polly (Nirvana song)\n\n\"Polly\" is a song by the American rock band, Nirvana, written by vocalist and guitarist, Kurt Cobain. It is the sixth song on their second album, \"Nevermind\", released in September 1991.\n\nOriginally titled \"Hitchhiker\" and later \"Cracker,\" \"Polly\" dates back to at least 1988. The earliest known version is a home demo featuring Cobain on vocals and guitar.\n\nThe song was first recorded in the studio by Steve Fisk at Music Source in Seattle, Washington in August, 1989. The sessions were for a planned EP to coincide with the band's European tour, but only two of the five songs recorded, \"Stain\" and \"Been a Son,\" were officially released, on the \"Blew\" EP later that year. On October 26, 1989, the band recorded a version during their first BBC \"Peel Session\", at Maida Vale Studios in London, England. The session, engineered by Ted de Bono, was originally broadcast on November 22, 1989.\n\nThe song was re-recorded by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin in April 1990. This acoustic version, featuring Chad Channing on drums, later appeared on the band's major label debut, \"Nevermind\", released in September 1991. It was the only recording from Vig's original session with the band to appear on the album, the rest of which was recorded by Vig in May 1991 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The recording features Cobain playing a five string Stella guitar that he said he purchased from a pawn shop for $20. \"I didn't bother changing the strings,\" Cobain told Jeff Gilbert in a 1992 \"Guitar World\" interview. \"It barely stays in tune. In fact, I had to use duct tape to hold the tuning keys in place.\" Vig remembers that the guitar's \"strings were so old they didn't have any tone to them. A real plunky sound.\" Cobain's guitar and Krist Novoselic's bass were recorded live, after which Cobain recorded lead and harmony vocals, and then Channing added the cymbal crashes.\n\nThe band recorded another version of the song for the BBC on November 9, 1991 at Maida Vale in London during their appearance on Radio 1's \"Mark Goodier Radio Session\". The session, their last for the BBC, was first broadcast on November 18, 1991, and three of the four songs from the session, including \"Polly,\" appeared on the band's compilation album \"Incesticide\" on December 1992. This faster version of the song appeared under the title \"(New Wave) Polly.\"\n\nCobain wrote \"Polly\" about an incident in Tacoma, Washington involving the abduction and rape of a 14-year-old girl in August 1987. Gerald Arthur Friend kidnapped the girl while she was leaving a rock concert, suspended her upside down from a pulley in his mobile home and raped and tortured her with a blow torch. She managed to escape by jumping from his truck at a gas station, attracting attention from surrounding people. Cobain's addition to the story was to have the victim fool the kidnapper into thinking she was enjoying what he was doing to her, causing him to let his guard down long enough for her to escape. In his 2001 biography \"Heavier than Heaven\", Charles Cross compared to the song to Truman Capote's \"In Cold Blood\" in that it was written from the criminal's point of view.\n\nIn his Nirvana biography \"Come As You Are\", journalist Michael Azerrad noted that rape seemed to be a consistent theme in Cobain's songs and interviews, as if Cobain was \"apologizing for his entire gender.\" However, Cobain explained, \"I don't feel bad about being a man at all. There are all kinds of men that are on the side of the woman and support them and help influence other men.\" In the liner notes to the band's 1992 compilation album \"Incesticide\", Cobain wrote that \"last year, a girl was raped by two wastes of sperm and eggs while they sang the lyrics to our song 'Polly'. I have a hard time carrying on knowing there are plankton like that in our audience.\"\n\nNirvana recorded \"Polly\" in the key of E minor with the chords E5-G5-D5-C5 for all verses and then the chords D5-C5-G5-B♭5 for all choruses. The song starts with Cobain playing the verse progression on an acoustic guitar and singing the vocals until the first chorus when bass enters and a cymbal crash is played. This is done for all verses and choruses. After the second chorus the guitar stops playing and a bass break starts. According to \"Nevermind\" producer Butch Vig on \"Classic Albums: Nevermind\", Cobain sang the line \"Polly said\" too early, but they decided to leave it in. The song ends with a final cymbal crash after the third chorus.\n\n\"Polly\" was ranked number 18 in \"NME's\" 2004 \"Top 20 Nirvana Songs\" list. In 2015, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 29 in their ranking of 102 Nirvana songs.\n\nAccording to \"Heavier than Heaven\", American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan was impressed with \"Polly\" upon hearing the song while at a Nirvana concert, remarking of Cobain that \"that kid has heart.\"\n\nSeveral versions of \"Polly,\" both studio-recorded and live, were released during the band's lifetime, and numerous others have been released posthumously. The following tables list all studio versions of the song, and all officially released live versions.\n\n"}

It stood on the corner of Long Acre (formerly Charles Street) and Endell Street, with entrances in Wilson Street and Long Acre. The site is within the modern Camden, part of Covent Garden.\n\nSt Martin's Hall contained a 3,000-seat main hall and a 500-seat lecture hall. It was used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings. The Queen's Theatre, one of the largest in London, had a capacity of 4,000 seats. The theatre closed after barely more than a decade, in 1878.\n\nThe name Queen's Theatre has been used for other theatres in central London, including the Queen's Theatre, Dorset Garden (from 1685 to 1705), Her Majesty's Theatre (from 1705 to 1714), Scala Theatre (during the period 1831–1865) and the modern Queen's Theatre in Shaftesbury Avenue (since 1907).\n\nSt Martin's Hall was built for John Hullah, in 1847, by William Cubitt, from a design by Richard Westmacott. The scheme was financed by subscription and it was built on a parallelogram of land, by wide, connected to a plot on Long Acre ( by ); and consisted of a main hall with connected anterooms, galleries and a 500–seat lecture hall. It was built in the Elizabethan style, with a large domed iron roof. The music hall was capable of seating 3,000 persons and was opened in 1850 by Hullah, the founder of a new \"school of choral harmony\". In addition to his singing classes, Hullah directed oratorios and concerts, both instrumental and vocal, at the hall. The hall was then used for musical recitals, lectures and political meetings.\n\nThe German Reed Entertainments were initially presented here in 1855 – known as \"Miss P. Horton's Illustrative Gatherings\" – before moving to the more intimate Gallery of Illustration and later St George's Hall. Charles Dickens first appeared as a public lecturer in St Martin's Hall, in April, 1858, speaking on behalf of the Hospital for Sick Children, in Great Ormond Street. A week or two later, he spoke on his own account.\n\nOn 26 August 1860, a fire broke out in a nearby coach factory and the hall was destroyed, together with its organ. The hall was rebuilt as a concert hall, opening in 1862. The First International was founded in St Martin's Hall in 1864. The final musical entertainment was given in 1867.\n\nIn 1867, a 4,000-seat theatre was built within the shell of the existing building by C. J. Phipps for Henry Labouchère and his partners, with interior decoration by Albert Moore and Telbin. A new company of players was formed, including Charles Wyndham, Henry Irving, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, Ellen Terry and Henrietta Hodson. The theatre opened as the New Queen's Theatre, with a production of Charles Reade's \"The Double Marriage\" on 24 October 1867. An early success was \"Dearer Than Life\", by H. J. Byron, with Brough, Toole, Wyndham, Hodson and Irving, coupled with W. S. Gilbert's \"La Vivandière\", a burlesque of \"La fille du régiment\". The theatre continued with melodrama, adaptions and classic revivals, dropping the epithet 'new' the following year.\nInitially, the management was run by the actor Alfred Wigan, who also appeared in its productions. By 1868, Hodson and Labouchère were living together out of wedlock, as they could not marry until her first husband finally died in 1887. Labouchère bought out his partners and used the theatre to showcase Hodson's talents. The theatre hosted comedies, such as F. C. Burnand's \"The Turn of the Tide\" (1869, starring Hermann Vezin and George Rignold with Hodson), historical dramas, such as Tom Taylor's \"Twixt Axe and Crown\" (1870), popular revivals of Shakespeare (starring such famous actors as Samuel Phelps) and Tommaso Salvini, dramatisations of Dickens novels, burlesques and extravaganzas. Although the theatre was among the largest and best equipped in London, and featured some of London's most famous stars, it lacked the guidance of an actor-manager of the stature of Henry Irving or Herbert Beerbohm Tree.\n\nIn 1877, the theatre became the National Theatre and hosted a series of promenade concerts under Riviere and Alfred Cellier followed by an ambitious dramatisation of \"The Last Days of Pompeii\" (Lord Lytton's eponymous novel) that was meant to feature a staged eruption of Vesuvius, an earthquake and a sybriatic Roman feast. However, the earth did not quake, the volcano did not erupt, acrobats fell onto the cast below, and the production was an expensive flop. The same year, the theatre was joined by overhead wires to the Canterbury Music Hall in Lambeth, and public demonstrations of the Cromwell Varley telephone were given. Several simple tunes were transmitted and emitted softly from a large drum-like apparatus suspended over the proscenium.\n\nThe theatre was open for little more than a decade, closing in April 1878. The interior was converted into a department store for the \"Clerical Co-operative Society\" and later occupied by the Odhams Press. The façade remained until redeveloped into a residential block in the 1970s.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "26592953", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=26592953", "title": "Segregated prom", "text": "Segregated prom\n\nA segregated prom refers to the practice of United States high schools, generally located in the Deep South, of holding racially segregated proms for white and black students. The practice spread after these schools were integrated, and persists in a few rural places to the present day. The separate proms have been the subject of frequent (often negative) press coverage, and several films.\n\nPrior to the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in \"Brown v. Board of Education\", most schools in the southern United States were racially segregated. The process of integration of schools was slow, and many schools did not become integrated until the late 1960s and early 1970s. In order to avoid having to hold an integrated prom, many high schools stopped sponsoring any prom, and private segregated proms were organized as a replacement. Sometimes a concern over interracial dating was cited as the reason for not holding a single prom. Other schools cited liability concerns as the reason for not sponsoring a prom.\n\nIn addition to segregated proms, some schools have also elected black and white homecoming kings and queens, class officers, and even awarded separate black and white superlatives such as \"Most Likely To Succeed.\" School sponsored separate events, including separate homecoming queens or superlatives, have been deemed to violate federal law by the United States Department of Justice.\nIn 1990, \"The New York Times\" reported that 10 counties in Georgia were still holding segregated proms. Though the practice has been reported to be on the decline, occasional press reports seem to show it persists in some rural locations. Since 1987, media sources have reported on segregated proms being held in the U.S. states of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas. \n\nWhen two separate proms are held for a school, generally the \"black prom\" is open to attendance by all students. Only the \"white prom\" is racially exclusive. \n\nSchool alumni at schools which held segregated proms sometimes hold segregated class reunions as well.\n\nEven prior to integration in the South, there have been instances of segregated proms being held in integrated schools in the northern United States. In the late 1920s, for example, separate proms for black and whites are recorded as occurring at Froebel High School in Gary, Indiana.\n\n\n"}

It starred Elsa Aguirre and Julio Alemán along Cosmo Alessio, Rodolfo Landa, Herbert Meneses and Regina Torné. The plot is about a forbidden romance that takes place during Holy Week in a city in Central America. In the 21st century \"Sólo de noche vienes\" is also an important film documentary of the Holy Week processions in Guatemala of the 1960s.\n\nAndrés Villalta is a Mexican tourist visiting a city in Central America to enjoy the Holy Week processions and meets Remedios -a local socialite who is married to one of the most powerful men in the country-, with whom has an instant spark. Then, Carmen -Remedios sister-in-law- suddenly appears and Remedios hides from her without giving any explanations to Andrés. Afterwards, when Andrés takes her home in his fancy sports car, Remedios lies to him telling that her name is Carmen -his sister-in-law's name- and omitting to say that she is married. confusion ensues, which makes Remedios even more mysterious to Andrés.\n\nDuring the climax, the whole family has gathered to watch Virgen Mary's silent procession, and then Andrés sees Remedios and when tries to reach for her, Remedios husband's cronies kill him on the spot. Andrés dies in Remedios arms, still calling her \"Carmen\".\n\nThe movie was directed by Sergio Véjar, and is based on a screenplay written specifically for the movie by the Mexican writer Elena Garro; Garro producer Manuel Zeceña and Véjar all worked on the final version of the screenplay. The plot shows the impossible love between a Mexican tourist and a mysterious lady that appears and vanishes as if she were a spirit or coming from a different dimension; Guatemala during Holy Week is the perfect frame for the mysterious romance. The elusive woman was actually married to a powerful character, who upon discovering her liaison orders the killing of her lover right there during a procession. The climatic scene shows both the infinity of the horizon, the rigidity of the religious and the volatility of love. Since the plot was originally written for the movie it was not included in the literary works of Garro.\n\nThe film was filmed in Guatemala and El Salvador and at the time the most intriguing part of it all was the fact that producer Manuel Zeceña was able to get Alemán and Aguirre to work together after they had been strained for a while. Interiors were filmed mainly in San Salvador, in private homes in Santa Tecla and the exclusive neighborhoods of Escalón and San Benito. The exteriors, on the other hand, were filmed in tourist attractions in \"Puerta del Diablo\" and \"Planes de Renderos\", also in El Salvador; however, since the plot is around a tourist that went to Central America to watch the Holy Week processions, several processions were filmed in Guatemala City. Therefore, the movie takes place in a fictitious city which is represented alternatively by San Salvador and Guatemala City.\n\nSoundtrack was composed by French composer Charles Trenet. The Salvadorian singers \"Los Hermanos Cárcamo\" (The Cárcamo Brothers) sang the title song \"Te deseo, amor\" (\"I lust for you, love\"). Roberto Cárcamo, lead singer, told to an interviewer on February 2002, that they had the opportunity to perform for the move after Julio Alemán heard them at Hotel El Salvador Intercontinental where he was staying during filming.\n\nIn Costa Rica, the movie opened on May 1967 and due to the strong controversy the plot had for the times, it was shown in a censored version and only for mature audiences that were at least 21 years old.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36825527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36825527", "title": "The Butler", "text": "The Butler\n\nThe Butler (full title Lee Daniels' The Butler) is a 2013 American historical drama film directed and produced by Lee Daniels and written by Danny Strong. It is inspired by Wil Haygood's \"Washington Post\" article \"A Butler Well Served by This Election\".\n\nLoosely based on the real life of Eugene Allen who worked in the White House for decades, the film stars Forest Whitaker as Cecil Gaines, an African-American who is a witness of notable political and social events of the 20th century during his 34-year tenure serving as a White House butler. In addition to Whitaker, the film's all-star cast also features Oprah Winfrey, John Cusack, Jane Fonda, Alex Pettyfer, Cuba Gooding Jr., Terrence Howard, Lenny Kravitz, James Marsden, David Oyelowo, Vanessa Redgrave, Alan Rickman, Liev Schreiber, Robin Williams, Minka Kelly, Mariah Carey, and Clarence Williams III. It was the last film produced by Laura Ziskin, who died in 2011.\n\nThe film was theatrically released by The Weinstein Company on August 16, 2013, to mostly positive reviews from critics, grossing over $176 million worldwide against a budget of $30 million.\n\nIn 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines recounts his life story while waiting at the White House to meet the newly inaugurated president.\n\nIn 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a cotton plantation in Macon, Georgia. When the farm's owner rapes Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.\n\nIn 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a Washington, D.C. hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the White House during Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration. White House maître d'hôtel Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by racially integrating Little Rock Central High School in Arkansas.\n\nLouis, the elder son, becomes a university student at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, although Cecil feels that the South is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) activist James Lawson, which leads to a nonviolent sit-in at a segregated diner, where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into alcoholism.\n\nIn 1961, after John F. Kennedy's inauguration, Louis and others are attacked by members of the Ku Klux Klan while on a freedom ride to Birmingham, Alabama. Louis participates in the 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade, where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver a national address proposing the Civil Rights Act of 1964. After Kennedy is assassinated his successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, Jackie Kennedy gives Cecil one of the former president's neckties.\n\nLouis participates in the 1965 Selma Voting Rights Movement, which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965. Johnson also gives Cecil a tie bar.\n\nIn the late 1960s, after civil rights activist Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination, Louis tells his family that he has joined the Black Panthers. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President Richard Nixon's plans to suppress the Black Panthers.\n\nCharlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the war in Vietnam. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at Arlington National Cemetery. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his master's degree in political science and eventually running for a seat in Congress, although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.\n\nCecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President Ronald Reagan's support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support economic sanctions against Apartheid South Africa, Cecil resigns.\n\nGloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against South African apartheid; they are arrested and jailed together.\n\nIn 2008, Gloria dies shortly before Barack Obama is elected as the nation's first African-American president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly inaugurated President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. Stephen W. Rochon approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama and civil rights leader Jesse Jackson are depicted in archival footage.\n\nMelissa Leo and Orlando Eric Street were cast as First Lady Mamie Eisenhower and Barack Obama, respectively, but did not appear in the finished film.\n\nDanny Strong's screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's \"Washington Post\" article \"A Butler Well Served by This Election\". The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached Sheila Johnson for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with Cassian Elwes, with whom they were working on \"The Paperboy\". Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, Icon U.K., a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, Michael Finley, and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started Weinstein Co. picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, \"a story that's a movie within itself.\"\n\nThe Weinstein Company acquired the distribution rights for the film after Columbia Pictures put the film in turnaround.\n\nThe film's title was up for a possible rename due to a Motion Picture Association of America claim from Warner Bros., which had inherited from the defunct Lubin Company a now-lost 1916 silent short film with the same name. The case was subsequently resolved with the MPAA granting The Weinstein Company permission to add Daniels' name in front of the title, under the condition that his name was \"75% the size of \"The Butler\". On July 23, 2013, the distributor unveiled a revised poster, displaying the title as \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\".\n\nPrincipal photography started in June 2012 in New Orleans. Production was originally scheduled to wrap in early August 2012 but was delayed by the impact of Hurricane Isaac.\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film debuted in first place with $24.6 million. The film topped the North American box office in its first three consecutive weeks. The film has grossed $116.6 million in Canada and the United States, it earned $51.1 million elsewhere, for a total of $167.7 million.\n\n\"The Butler\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 71% rating on the film critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 175 reviews. The site's consensus says, \"Gut-wrenching and emotionally affecting, \"Lee Daniels' The Butler\" overcomes an uneven narrative thanks to strong performances from an all-star cast.\" Another review aggregator, Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 66 based on 47 reviews, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".\n\nTodd McCarthy praised the film saying, \"Even with all contrivances and obvious point-making and familiar historical signposting, Daniels' \"The Butler\" is always engaging, often entertaining and certainly never dull.\" Richard Roeper lauded the film's casting in particular, remarking that \"Forest Whitaker gives the performance of his career\". \"Rolling Stone\" also spoke highly of Whitaker writing that his \"reflective, powerfully understated performance...fills this flawed film with potency and purpose.\" \"Variety\" wrote that \"Daniels develops a strong sense of the inner complexities and contradictions of the civil-rights landscape.\" \"USA Today\" gave the film three out of four stars and noted that \"It's inspiring and filled with fine performances, but the insistently swelling musical score and melodramatic moments seem calculated and undercut a powerful story.\" Miles Davis of the \"New York Tribune\" gave the film a negative review, claiming the film to be \"Oscar bait\", a cliche film designed to attract Oscar nominations.\n\nKenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" was more negative; \"An ambitious and overdue attempt to create a Hollywood-style epic around the experience of black Americans in general and the civil rights movement in particular, it undercuts itself by hitting its points squarely on the nose with a 9-pound hammer.\" Several critics compared the film's historical anecdotes and sentimentality to \"Forrest Gump\".\n\nPresident Barack Obama said, \"I teared up thinking about not just the butlers who worked here in the White House, but an entire generation of people who were talented and skilled. But because of Jim Crow and because of discrimination, there was only so far they could go.\"\n\nRegarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in \"Time\": \"Allen was born on a Virginia plantation in 1919, not in Georgia... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was added for dramatic effect... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie.\"\n\nParticular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President Ronald Reagan. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to Michael Reagan, the former president's son, \"The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there.\" Paul Kengor, one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, \"I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan.\" In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa, Kengor said, \"Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "18445050", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18445050", "title": "The No Asshole Rule", "text": "The No Asshole Rule\n\nThe No Asshole Rule: Building a Civilized Workplace and Surviving One That Isn't is a book by Stanford professor Robert I. Sutton, based on a popular essay he wrote for the \"Harvard Business Review\". It sold over 115,000 copies and won the Quill Award for best business book in 2007.\n\nThe theme of this book is that bullying behaviour in the workplace worsens morale and productivity. A rule is suggested to screen out the toxic staff—the \"no asshole rule\". The author insists upon use of the word asshole since other words such as bully or jerk \"do not convey the same degree of awfulness\". In terms of using the word in the book's title, he said \"There's an emotional reaction to a dirty title. You have a choice between being offensive and being ignored.\"\n\nTwo tests are specified for recognition of the asshole:\n\n\nTheir unpleasant behaviours were catalogued by Sutton as \"The Dirty Dozen\":\n\n\nSutton believes there is a difference between ‘temporary’ assholes who might be having a bad moment or day and certified ‘assholes’ who are “persistently nasty.” He gives the example of when he sent a scornful email to a colleague because he wrongly believed she was trying to take an office away from his group. In this instance, he was acting like a temporary asshole and to be a certified asshole he would have to act like a jerk persistently. Famous bosses who are cited as having weakened their position by bad behaviour include Al Dunlap and Michael Eisner. Another example of a certified asshole is the Hollywood boss Scott Rudin. Rudin has fired 250 personal assistants for reasons such as bringing him the wrong muffin. Rudin also qualifies as an asshole as his targets are less powerful than him and are left feeling humiliated.\n\nSutton makes the caveat that while it is essential to screen for assholes, a company should not recruit “spineless wimps.” He believes constructive arguments benefit firms and help workers come up with better ideas. Sutton cites the Intel co-founder Andy Grove as someone who believes workers should challenge each other's thoughts. Intel teaches employees “how to fight” and requires new employees to take classes in ‘constructive confrontation.’\n\nThe necessity of the No Asshole Rule and the damage assholes do is discussed by Sutton. He relays Bennett Tepper’s research on 712 employees. Many of these workers had bosses who would oppress and belittle them, and Tepper studied the effect these bosses had on them. After six months he found workers with abusive bosses “quit their jobs at accelerated rates, and those still trapped in their jobs suffered from less work and life satisfaction, reduced commitment to employers, and heightened depression, anxiety, and burnout.” Sutton relays even minor things such as treating someone as invisible and giving nasty stares can accumulate and adversely affect someone’s mental health. Sutton describes how assholes not only effect victims themselves but also the bystanders and witnesses that see and hear about the abuse. Co-workers, family members, and friends are among those who are negatively affected. One British study of more than seven hundred employees in the public sector found “73 percent of the witnesses to bullying incidents experienced increased stress and 44 percent worried about becoming targets themselves”. This shows assholes can harm and lessen the productivity of not only their victims but everyone in the workplace. Sutton states the assholes themselves also suffer from their actions in the form of “career setbacks and, at times, humiliation.” Even when these jerks do their jobs well they can still be fired. He cites the example of the Indiana Hoosiers coach Bob Knight who despite all his achievements was fired from repeatedly losing his temper.\n\nSutton discusses the total cost of assholes or the ‘TCA’ for organizations. While it is impossible to calculate the exact TCA for an organization, Sutton believes it is instructive for companies to estimate how much assholes are costing them. Factors to consider include the number of hours managers and HR professionals devote to ‘asshole management’ and the costs of lost clients. Future legal costs resulting from lawsuits against assholes and the cost of recruiting and training new employees should also be considered. Researchers Charlotte Rayner and Loraleigh Keashly have used data based on studies in the UK to calculate a company’s TCA. They estimate that “25 percent of bullying 'targets' and 20 percent of 'witnesses' leave their jobs, and that the 'average' bullying rate in the U.K. is 15 percent”. This means if 25% of victims leave a company of 1,000 people the replacement cost is $20,000 and the annual replacement cost is $750,000. If 20% of victims leave and there is an average of two witnesses for each victim, the replacement cost is $1.2 million, and the total replacement cost is just shy of $2 million. A senior executive from Silicon Valley has previously calculated the cost of an employee Sutton calls Ethan. The expenses relating to Ethan’s poor treatment of others totaled around $160,000, and his company deducted some of this money from his bonus. \n\nCompanies who are listed as having appropriate recruitment policies include: Barclays Capital, Google, JetBlue, Men's Wearhouse, and IDEO. IDEO offers jobs to candidates who have interned with the company before and have “demonstrated under real working conditions that they aren’t assholes.” They advise candidates they have not previously worked with to have strong recommendations and to have taught in university classrooms. Every candidate at IDEO is also interviewed “by people who will be above, below, and alongside them, status-wise.” This method ensures if one high up manager is an asshole he will not be able to hire more jerks. \n\nSutton also stresses companies should mean what they say. While many companies have written versions of the no asshole rule, few entirely abide by them. A group of Sutton’s students did a case study on a security company who said they value “respect for the individual, teamwork, and integrity.” The study revealed in actuality the company was disrespectful to young analysts and treated them with mistrust. These analysts were top students from prestigious universities and were working at the company for a few years until they returned to school get their MBAs. As a result of treating these employees poorly, the company had a low rate of return and had a hard time recruiting employees back when they finished school. \n\nSutton discusses how to enforce the no asshole rule and gives the Men's Wearhouse and a Fortune 500 company as examples of businesses who have done this successfully. The Men’s Warehouse fired a selfish and difficult employee even though he was one of the company’s most successful salespeople, and as a result, the total sale volume in the store increased. A CEO at a fortune 500 company evaluated employees and fired people on his ‘hit list’ over a period of two years. The firm benefited from firing these assholes as they have risen from the “middle of the pack” to one of the top firms in the industry. A special chapter is also dedicated to \"the virtues of assholes\", in which Steve Jobs is discussed as a prime example.\n\nSutton advises companies to adopt the “one asshole rule.” Sutton believes by having a couple of token jerks in a company, coworkers will observe their bad behavior and be more likely to do the right thing. He based his hypothesis on a series of studies on littering done by Robert Cialdini. In one trial of the study researchers spewed garbage and litter around a parker lot, and in a separate trial, they made sure the lot was spotless. They placed a flyer on a driver’s windshield and observed what the driver did with that flyer. As part of the experiment half of the drivers encountered a researcher who picked up the flyer on their car and threw it on the ground. Watching this one driver litter affected the subject as “drivers who saw the 'norm violation' were less likely to throw their handbill into a clean parking lot (6 percent vs. 14 percent) but more likely to throw it into a messy lot (54 percent vs. 32 percent)”. This study shows when one person is caught breaking a rule others are more likely to follow it whereas if everyone seems to be breaking the rule we are more likely to break it as well. Sutton has applied this theory to companies and believes they should each have a “reverse role model” to remind others of the wrong behavior. \n\nThe book argues that asshole behavior is rather common by citing various studies: \n\nThe book also affirms that employees perceive \"upward\" nastiness – i.e. directed toward bosses – as the rarest form and occurring in only 1% of the cases, while perceived \"downward\" nastiness is estimated to account for 50%–80% of occurrences, with 20%–50% occurring among coworkers of roughly the same rank.\n\nIn 2010, Sutton published a sequel, \"Good Boss, Bad Boss: How to Be the Best... and Learn from the Worst\", which provided guidance on being a good boss. A follow-up book was released in 2017 called \"The Asshole Survival Guide: How to Deal with People Who Treat You Like Dirt\". \n\n"}

Health information and a description of events prior to death are acquired from conversations or interviews with a person or persons familiar with the deceased and analyzed by health professional or computer algorithms to assign a probable cause of death.\n\nVerbal autopsy is used in settings where most deaths are undocumented. Estimates suggest a majority of the 60 million annual global deaths occur without medical attention or official medical certification of the cause of death. The VA method attempts to establish causes of death for previously undocumented subjects, allowing scientists to analyze disease patterns and direct public health policy decisions.\n\nNoteworthy uses of the verbal autopsy method include the Million Death Study in India, China's national program to document causes of death in rural areas, and the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.\n\nThe term \"verbal autopsy\" was first coined in a project of the Department of International Health of Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health which ran from 1965 to 1973 in Punjab, India. Two research projects were located in villages near Ludhiana, with headquarters in Narangwal village.

The \"verbal autopsy\" method as originally developed in Narangwal was slightly modified to the Egyptian setting and again used to identify prevailing mortality patterns among preschoolers. Following implementation of different treatment schedules, child mortality rates dropped significantly in specific input villages over the period of study. The project site was re-visited six years following completion of the investigation confirming utility and effectiveness of the V.A. method, and applied intervention modalities respectively.\n\nAs early as the 1950s forms of VA called lay reporting were employed in countries with low coverage of medical access. The World Health Organization (WHO) continued to encourage lay reporting in such settings and in 1975 an official lay reporting form was established.\n\nMany iterations of the questionnaire used in VA have been developed by health professionals and researchers. The WHO now employs a standard verbal autopsy method, involving a recommended questionnaire.\n\nAnalysis of the interviews can be done by computer.\n"}

The story begins with Victor's arrival at the Deaf-Mute institute in Paris and Dr. Itard's enthusiasm that here was an opportunity to prove his theory that whatever a person's background, they could be brought into civilised society. Unfortunately, the task proves far more difficult than he anticipated...\n\nInspiration for the novel came from Uta Frith's 1989 book \"\" in which the Wild Boy of Aveynon is claimed to be the first documented autistic child.

He attended St. Mark's School of Texas from grade 1 through 12. At age 15, Hootkins found himself caught up in the FBI's investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy when he was interviewed about Ruth Paine, his Russian teacher. Marina Oswald, the Russian wife of the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, and their children had been living with Paine in Dallas. In school he also developed his taste for theatre, joining the same drama group as Tommy Lee Jones, who was a year ahead of him in high school. Hootkins would later say that, since Jones was better-looking and got all the best parts, \"I supported from then on in.\"\n\nHootkins attended Princeton University, studying astrophysics before transferring to oriental studies, where he became fluent in Mandarin Chinese. This stood him in good stead when he played the part of an interpreter in an episode of \"The West Wing\" titled \"Impact Winter\". He was a mainstay of the Theatre Intime, making a particular impact with his performance in Orson Welles' \"Moby Dick—Rehearsed\". On the recommendation of his friend John Lithgow, he moved to London in the early 1970s and trained as an actor at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). He made his home in London until 2002, when he moved to Los Angeles.\n\nIn England, Hootkins found work in the theatre as well as in film, and he would have his greatest success on stage portraying Alfred Hitchcock in Terry Johnson's 2003 hit play \"Hitchcock Blonde\", first at the Royal Court Theatre and in London's West End. The role was such a success that producers planned to take the show to Broadway, but it was canceled after he was diagnosed with cancer.\n\nHootkins appeared in many roles that made him a welcome figure at fan conventions, particularly for \"Star Wars\" in his role of Jek Tono Porkins. He also appeared in significant parts in films as \"Hardware\" (1990), \"Like Father, Like Santa\" (as Santa Claus), and \"Hear My Song\" (1991), where he was the Mr. X who was presumed to be the Irish tenor Josef Locke under a false name. He portrayed Fatty Arbuckle in Ken Russell's infamous 1977 flop \"Valentino\", and played Hans Zarkov's assistant in the 1980 \"Flash Gordon\". He also made appearances in such films as \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and Tim Burton's \"Batman\" (the latter as Lt. Eckhardt).\n\nHe also appeared in several roles on television, including Charles Frohman in \"The Lost Boys\" (1978), Colonel Cobb in the remake of \"The Tomorrow People\" and as Uncle George in the 2002 remake of \"The Magnificent Ambersons\".\n\nAt the time of his death, Hootkins was planning a screenplay on Fatty Arbuckle, focusing on the comic's life after his fall from grace in 1921; he had met Arbuckle's last wife, Addie McPhail.\n\nHe was also a voice artist, recording dozens of plays for BBC Radio Drama where his roles ranged from J. Edgar Hoover and Orson Welles to Winston Churchill. In audio books, he read works by Jack London, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Robert Bloch and Carl Hiaasen and performed a complete reading of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\" for Naxos Records Audiobooks in some 24 hours and 50 minutes. He also voiced Dingodile in \"\", Maximillian Roivas in the cult hit \"\", and Lucifer in the stop-motion film \"The Miracle Maker\". He played Bobby Mallory in BBC Radio4's dramatisations of Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski novels, alongside Kathleen Turner.\n\nHootkins died of pancreatic cancer in Santa Monica, California on October 23, 2005, at the age of 57.
