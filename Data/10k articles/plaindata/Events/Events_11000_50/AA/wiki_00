The Mine Safety and Health Administration of the United States Department of Labor reported the explosion was caused when an underburdened shot or blown-out shot ignited coal dust. At the time of the explosion, 142 men were in the mine; 65 were killed by burns and other injuries and 45 were killed by afterdamp. Eight men were rescued, but one died from the effects of afterdamp. Only 31 miners escaped.\n\nAmerican folksinger Woody Guthrie wrote and recorded a song about the Centralia mine disaster entitled \"The Dying Miner.\" Guthrie's recording of the song is now available on the Smithsonian-Folkways recording \"Struggle\" (1990). Songwriter Bucky Halker rearranged this song and recorded it for his \"Welcome to Labor Land\" CD (Revolting Records, 2002), a collection of Halker's renditions of labor songs from Illinois. Halker also recorded his version of \"New Made Graves of Centralia\" for his CD \"Don't Want Your Millions\" (Revolting Records, 2000). Halker based his version on an original recording of this song in the Country Music Hall of Fame, but the author and recording artist were unknown.\n\nAlong with \"The Dying Miner,\" Guthrie wrote two other songs regarding the 1947 disaster: \"Waiting at the Gate\" (from the perspective of a miner's son); and \"Talking Centralia\" (also known as \"Talking Miner\").\n\n\n"}

One of the officers and their driver died while resisting the attackers.\n\nOn 30 May 1990, a team of three health officers were returning to Kolkata after inspecting an immunization program in Gosaba. The team consisted of Anita Dewan, the Deputy District Extension Media Officer of the West Bengal Health Department; Uma Ghosh, a senior officer of the Health Department; and Renu Ghosh, a representative of UNICEF's World Health Organization office in New Delhi. Around 6:30 pm when they had reached Bantala near the Eastern metropolitan bypass, a group of 4-5 youths stopped their car near the CPI(M) party office. The driver Abani Naia made an attempt to escape, but he lost control and the car overturned. In the mean time, another gang of 10-12 youths arrived at the spot, who pulled one of the ladies out of the car, while the others pulled out the other two ladies. The driver of the car tried to resist the youths, but failed. The attackers killed the driver and set the car on fire. The lady officers were then taken to a nearby paddy field and raped. One of the ladies, who tried to resist the rapists was killed.\n\nThe police brought the naked bodies of the officers to the emergency department of Calcutta National Medical College at around 11:30 pm. Initially they were presumed to be dead, but later two of them was found to be alive and were admitted for treatment. One lady doctor who examined the dead woman fainted when she discovered a metallic torch in the vagina of the officer.\n\nThe injured driver was transferred to SSKM Hospital for treatment. He bore 43 wounds in his body caused by blunt, sharp and heavy weapons. His penis was smashed by the attackers. On 4 June 1990 at 5:40 am, he died.

{"id": "59094216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59094216", "title": "Accident triangle", "text": "Accident triangle\n\nThe accident triangle also known as Heinrich's triangle or Bird's triangle is a theory of industrial accident prevention. It shows a relationship between serious accidents, minor accidents and near misses and proposes that if the number of minor accidents is reduced then there will be a corresponding fall in the number of serious accidents. The triangle was first proposed by Herbert William Heinrich in 1931 and has since been updated and expanded upon by other writers, notably Frank E. Bird. It is often shown pictorially as a triangle or pyramid and has been described as a cornerstone of 20th century workplace health and safety philosophy. In recent times it has come under criticism over the values allocated to each category of accident and for focusing only on the reduction in minor injuries.\n\nThe triangle shows a relationship between the number of accidents resulting in serious injury, minor injuries or no injuries. The relationship was first proposed in 1931 by Herbert William Heinrich in his \"Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach\". Heinrich was a pioneer in the field of workplace health and safety. He worked as an assistant superintendent for an insurance company and wanted to reduce the number of serious industrial accidents. He commenced a study of more than 75,000 accident reports from the insurance company's files as well as records held by individual industry sites. From this data he proposed a relationship of one major injury accident to 29 minor injury accidents, to 300 no-injury accidents. He drew the conclusion that, by reducing the number of minor accidents, industrial companies would see a correlating fall in the number of major accidents. The relationship is often shown pictorially in the form of a triangle or pyramid. The triangle was widely used in industrial health and safety programmes over the following 80 years and was described as a cornerstone of health and safety philosophy. Heinrich's theory also suggested that 88% of all accidents were caused by a human decision to carry out an unsafe act.\n\nThe theory was developed further by Frank E Bird in 1966 based on the analysis of 1.7 million accident reports from almost 300 companies. He produced an amended triangle that showed a relationship of one serious injury accident to 10 minor injury (first aid only) accidents, to 30 damage causing accidents, to 600 near misses. Bird showed a relationship between the number of reported near misses and the number of major accidents and claimed that the majority of accidents could be predicted and prevented by an appropriate intervention. The numbers used by Bird were confirmed by a 1974 study by A. D. Swain, entitled \"The Human Element in Systems Safety\". The theory was later expanded upon by Bird and Germain in 1985's \"Practical Loss Control Leadership\".\n\nHeinrich's triangle had a significant impact on health and safety culture in the 20th century but has recently been criticised. Some of this criticism regards to the exact figures used in the relationship. A 2010 report relating to he oil and gas industry showed that the original values only held true when applied to a large dataset and a broad range of activities. A 1991 study showed that in confined spaces the relationship was significantly different: 1.2 minor injuries for each serious injury or death. A broad study of UK accident data in the mid 1990s showed a relationship of 1 fatality to 207 major injuries, to 1,402 injuries causing three or more days lost time injuries, to 2,754 minor injuries. Heinrich's original files have since been lost so his accident figures cannot be proven.\n\nW. Edwards Deming stated that Heinrich's theory attributing human action as the cause of most accidents in the workplace was incorrect and it was, in fact, poor management systems that caused the majority of accidents. There has also been criticism of the triangle for focusing attention on the reduction of minor accidents. It has been claimed that this has led to workplace supervisors to ignore more serious but less likely risks when planning works in order to focus on reducing the likelihood of more common but less serious risks. The 2010 oil and gas study claimed that this attitude had led to a halt in the reduction of fatalities in that industry in the preceding five to eight years, despite a significant reduction in minor accidents.\n"}

In the process of starting the large tour, Eminem wanted to include Nine Inch Nails into the list of artists, but Marilyn Manson joining the tour would raise the issues between him and Trent Reznor. Eminem decided to not ask Reznor to join the tour due to the friendship he has with Manson. Eminem also came up with the name for the tour, being quoted in \"Rolling Stone\" saying \"It's the perfect name for a tour like this, because most of the music featured in the tour is about anger, frustration, and the bullshit of our lives and the fans loving every minute of it. It's the blend of hardcore rap, industrial metal, and alternative metal that gives it the anger management feel, literally.\"\n\nIn the first tour, most of the concerts were extremely long, due to the number of artists that were chosen to headline the massive tour. Many of the concerts were praised for the production value and how each artist played like it was their own tour. Many critics agreed that one of the great things about the concerts were that they felt like they were made up of mini concerts.\n\nThe second tour took place in the summer of 2002. Eminem told LAUNCH, \"It's basically the same thing that it was the last Anger Management Tour without Limp Bizkit... Papa Roach are still cool though.\"\nThese concerts on the second tour were infamously just as long as the first time around, which in turn led to a controversial incident during a European Leg of the tour. During a stop in Milton Keynes, UK, fans grew restless and agitated at the prolonged 'stage changeovers' between artists and proceeded to throw bottles of liquid (liquor, water, and urine) at the stage. It is thought one of these bottles of liquid hit rapper Xzibit during his set, causing him to leave the stage having suffered a broken jaw.\n\nThe bottle throwing incident in Milton Keynes was referenced by Eminem and D12 in a song titled 'American Psycho 2', in which Em retorts 'go find out who did that shit to Xzibit, fill up a whole liquor bottle of piss and shatter his fucking face'\n\nThe third tour took place in the summer of 2005. 50 Cent missed the tour's first two stops because of a scheduling conflict; he was tied up shooting his film debut.

{"id": "6520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6520", "title": "Cow tipping", "text": "Cow tipping\n\nCow tipping is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright cow and pushing it over for entertainment. The practice of cow tipping is generally considered an urban legend, and stories of such feats viewed as tall tales. The implication that rural citizens seek such entertainment due to lack of other alternatives is viewed as a stereotype. The concept of cow tipping apparently developed in the 1970s, though tales of animals that cannot rise if they fall has historical antecedents dating to the Roman Empire.\n\nCows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing unless sick or injured. Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions. All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or \"cast\", such as for branding, hoof care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over. On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a figure of speech.\n\nThe urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. Some versions suggest that because cows sleep standing up, it is possible to approach them and push them over without the animals reacting. However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened. They lie down to sleep deeply. Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.\n\nA 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a zoologist at the University of British Columbia, and her student Tracy Boechler, concluded that tipping a cow would require a force of nearly and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow, based on an estimate that a single person could exert of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed. Further, cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing. Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its centre of mass were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way. Lillie stated, \"It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible.\"\n\nAlthough he agrees that it would take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a standing cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human. Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons, Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. \"If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity\", he says, \"about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be neededâquite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow.\"\n\nThe belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents, though cattle have never been so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely another name for the elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.\n\nIn 1255, Louis IX of France gave an elephant to Henry III of England for his menagerie in the Tower of London. A drawing by the historian Matthew Paris for his \"Chronica Majora\" can be seen in his bestiary at Parker Library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. An accompanying text cites elephant lore suggesting that elephants did not have knees and were unable to get up if they fell.\n\nJournalist Jake Steelhammer believes the American urban myth of cow tipping originated in the 1970s. It \"stampeded into the '80s\", he says, \"when movies like \"Tommy Boy\" and \"Heathers\" featured cow tipping expeditions.\" Stories about cow tipping tend to be second-hand, he says, told by someone who does not claim to have tipped a cow but who knows someone else who says he or she did.\n\nCattle may need to be deliberately thrown or tipped over for certain types of husbandry practices and medical treatment. When done for medical purposes, this is often called \"casting\", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip bowline knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in sternal recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.\n\nA calf table or calf cradle, also called a \"tipping table\" or a \"throw down\", is a relatively modern invention designed to be used on calves that are being branded. A calf is run into a chute, confined, and then tipped by the equipment onto its side for easier branding and castration.\n\nHydraulic tilt tables for adult cattle have existed since the 1970s and are designed to lift and tip cattle onto their sides to enable veterinary care, particularly of the animals' genitalia, and for hoof maintenance. (Unlike horses, cows generally do not cooperate with a farrier when standing.) A Canadian veterinarian explained, \"Using the table is much safer and easier than trying to get underneath to examine the animal\", and noted that cows tipped over on a padded table usually stop struggling and become calm fairly quickly. One design, developed at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, included \"cow comfort\" as a unique aspect of care using this type of apparatus.\n\nCows may tip themselves inadvertently. Due to their bulk and relatively short legs, cattle cannot roll over. Those that lie down and roll to their sides with their feet pointing uphill may become stuck and unable to rise without assistance, with potentially fatal results. In such cases, two humans can roll or flip a cow onto its other side, so that its feet are aimed downhill, thus allowing it to rise on its own.\nIn one documented case of \"real-life cow tipping\", a pregnant cow rolled into a gully in New Hampshire and became trapped in an inverted state until rescued by volunteer fire fighters. The owner of the cow commented that he had seen this happen \"once or twice\" before.\n\nTrauma or illness may also result in a cow unable to rise to its feet. Such animals are sometimes called \"downers.\" Sometimes this occurs as a result of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as mastitis. Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes. Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survivedâwith medical careâas long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling from one side to the other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of fodder, and access to clean water.\n\nDead animals may appear to have been tipped over. But this is actually the process of rigor mortis, which stiffens the muscles of the carcass, beginning six to eight hours after death and lasting for one to two days. It is particularly noticeable in the limbs, which stick out straight. Post-mortem bloat also occurs because of gas formation inside the body. The process may result in cattle carcasses that wind up on their back with all four feet in the air.\n\nAssorted individuals have claimed to have performed cow tipping, often while under the influence of alcohol. These claims, to date, cannot be reliably verified, with Jake Swearingen of \"Modern Farmer\" noting in 2013 that YouTube, a popular source of videos of challenges and stunts, \"fails to deliver one single actual cow-tipping video\".\n\nPranksters have sometimes pushed over artificial cows. Along Chicago's Michigan Avenue in 1999, two \"apparently drunk\" men felled six fiberglass cows that were part of a Cows on Parade public art exhibit. Four other vandals removed a \"Wow cow\" sculpture from its lifeguard chair at Oak Street Beach and abandoned it in a pedestrian underpass. A year later, New York City anchored its CowParade art cows, including \"A Streetcow Named Desire\", to concrete bases \"to prevent the udder disrespect of cow-tippers and thieves.\"\n\nCow tipping has been featured in films from the 1980s and later, such as \"Heathers\" (1988), \"Tommy Boy\" (1995), \" Barnyard\" (2006), and \"I Love You, Beth Cooper\" (2009). It was also used in the title of a 1992 documentary film by Randy Redroad, \"Cow TippingâThe Militant Indian Waiter\". The film \"Cars\" (2006) features a vehicular variant called tractor-tipping.\n\nIn The Little Willies song \"Lou Reed\" from their 2006 eponymous debut album, Norah Jones sings about a fictional event during which musician Lou Reed tips cows in Texas. In another medium, \"The Big Bang Theory\", a television show, uses cow tipping lore as an element to establish the nature of a rural character, Penny. \n\nThe term \"cow tipping\" is sometimes used as a figure of speech for pushing over something big. In \"A Giant Cow-Tipping by Savages\", author John Weir Close uses the term to describe contemporary mergers and acquisitions. \"Tipping sacred cows\" has been used as a deliberate mixed metaphor in titles of books on Christian ministry and business management.\n\n\n\n"}

In 1975 he founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers (AFIO), an alumni association comprising intelligence officers from all services.\n\nPhillips was born in Fort Worth, Texas and attended The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia and Texas Christian University in Fort Worth. Phillips was an actor prior to World War II. During the war, he served as a nose gunner in the United States Army Air Forces. He was shot down over Austria and captured by the Germans, but was somehow able to escape and make it back to Allied lines.\n\nPhillips joined the CIA as a part-time agent in 1950 in Chile, where he owned and edited \"The South Pacific Mail\", an English-language newspaper that circulated throughout South America and several islands in the Pacific. He became a full-time operative in 1954, and operated a major psychological warfare campaign in Guatemala during the US coup and its aftermath. He rose through the ranks to intelligence officer, chief of station and eventually chief of Western hemisphere operations, serving primarily in Latin America, including Cuba, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. Phillips retired from the agency in 1975 and founded the Association of Former Intelligence Officers in the same year.\n\nWhile investigating Lee Harvey Oswald's possible ties to certain radical groups around the time of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, the HSCA obtained statements from Alpha 66 founder Antonio Veciana that Oswald had met on several occasions with a CIA operative known as \"Maurice Bishop\". After one former CIA case officer (who had been assigned to the JM/WAVE station in Miami) stated to investigators that Phillips had been known to use the alias, the commission attempted to see if Veciana could identify Phillips as being \"Bishop\". Veciana insisted that he was not the same person and moreover that he had never met Phillips before either. Some committee members (and also lead investigator Gaeton Fonzi) doubted Veciana, reasoning that he should have at least recognized Phillips, a high-profile officer so heavily involved in Cuban operations. \n\nIn 2014, at a conference named \"The Warren Report and the JFK Assassination: Five Decades of Significant Disclosures\", Veciana reversed his previous statements, asserting unequivocally that he believed that the agent he knew as Bishop had in fact been David Atlee Phillips.\n\nIn their 1980 book \"Death in Washington\", authors Donald Freed and Fred Landis charged that the CIA was involved in the 1973 Chilean coup d'Ã©tat and the 1976 assassination of Orlando Letelier. The authors specifically named Phillips as being involved in a cover-up of the assassination and reiterated Fonzi's claim that Phillips served as Oswald's case officer while using the alias \"Maurice Bishop\". In 1982, Freed, Landis, and their publisher were named in a $230 million libel suit by Phillips and the AFIO. A settlement was reached in 1976 (?) with Phillips receiving a retraction and an unspecified amount of money. Phillips donated these proceeds to AFIO for the purpose of creating a legal defense fund for American intelligence officers who felt they were the victims of libel.\n\nAfter the death of former CIA agent and Watergate figure E. Howard Hunt in 2007, Saint John Hunt and David Hunt revealed that their father had recorded several claims about himself and others being involved in a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy. In the April 5, 2007 issue of \"Rolling Stone\", Saint John Hunt detailed a number of individuals implicated by his father including Phillips, as well as Lyndon B. Johnson, Cord Meyer, David SÃ¡nchez Morales, Frank Sturgis, William Harvey and an assassin he termed \"French gunman grassy knoll\" who many presume was Lucien Sarti. The two sons alleged that their father cut the information from his memoirs, \"American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA, Watergate and Beyond\", to avoid possible perjury charges. Hunt's widow and other children told the \"Los Angeles Times\" that the two sons took advantage of Hunt's loss of lucidity by coaching and exploiting him for financial gain. The newspaper said it examined the materials offered by the sons to support the story and found them to be \"inconclusive.\"\n\nPhillips wrote and lectured frequently on intelligence matters. He authored five books, including his CIA memoir \"The Night Watch\", \"Careers in Secret Operations: How to Be a Federal Intelligence Officer\", \"The Terror Brigade,\" \"The Carlos Contract,\" and \"The Great Texas Murder Trials: A Compelling Account of the Sensational T. Cullen Davis Case.\"\n\nPhillips died at his home in Bethesda, Maryland from complications of cancer on July 7, 1988; at the age of 65.\n\nIn 1948, Phillips married Helen Hausman Haasch. They had four children, then divorced in 1967. In 1969, he married his second wife, Virginia Pederson Simmons, who had three children from a previous marriage. Together, the couple had one other child.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29815796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29815796", "title": "Exhibition", "text": "Exhibition\n\nAn exhibition, in the most general sense, is an organised presentation and display of a selection of items. In practice, exhibitions usually occur within a cultural or educational setting such as a museum, art gallery, park, library, exhibition hall, or World's fairs. Exhibitions can include many things such as art in both major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive exhibitions, natural history museums and history museums, and also varieties such as more commercially focused exhibitions and trade fairs.\n\nIn British English the word \"exhibition\" is used for a collection of items placed on display, and the event as a whole, which in American English is usually an \"exhibit\". In both varieties of English each object being shown within an exhibition is an \"exhibit\".\n\nIn common usage, \"exhibitions\" are considered temporary and usually scheduled to open and close on specific dates. While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations and are called travelling exhibitions, and some are online exhibitions. Exhibitions featuring especially fragile or valuable objects, or live animalsâmay be shown only during a formal presentation, under the close supervision of attendant or educator. Temporary exhibits that are transported from institution to institution are traveling exhibits.\n\nThough exhibitions are common events, the concept of an exhibition is quite wide and encompasses many variables. Exhibitions range from an extraordinarily large event such as a World's fair exposition to small one-artist solo shows or a display of just one item. Curators are sometimes involved as the people who select the items in an exhibition. Writers and editors are sometimes needed to write text, labels and accompanying printed material such as catalogs and books. Architects, exhibition designers, graphic designers and other designers may be needed to shape the exhibition space and give form to the editorial content. Organizing and holding exhibitions also requires effective event planning, management, and logistics.\n\nThe exhibition came fully into its own in the 19th century, but various temporary exhibitions had been held before that, especially the regular displays of mostly new art in major cities. The Paris Salon of the AcadÃ©mie des Beaux-Arts was the most famous of these, beginning in 1667, and open to the public from 1737. By the mid-18th century this and its equivalents in other countries had become crucial for developing and maintaining the reputation of contemporary artists. In London the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition has been held annually since 1769, and the British Institution ran temporary exhibitions from 1805 to 1867, typically twice a year, with one of new British painting and one of loans of old masters from the Royal Collection and the aristocratic collections of English country houses. \n\nBy the mid-19th century many of the new national museums of Europe were in place, and holding exhibitions of their own collections, or loaned collections, or a mixture of objects from both sourcers, which remains a typical mix today. The \"Chronology of Temporary Exhibitions at the British Museum\" goes back to 1838. \n\nThe tradition of the Universal exposition \"world Expo\" or \"World's Fair\" began with the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London; these are only held every few years, most recently in 2015 in Milan and 2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was built for the Exposition Universelle (1889) and served as an entrance arch.\n\nModern exhibitions may be concerned with preservation, education and demonstration, early exhibitions were designed to attract public interest and curiosity. Before the widespread adoption of photography, the exhibition of a single object could attract large crowds. Visitors might even be overcome with Stendhal syndrome, feeling dizzy or overwhelmed by the intense sensory experience of an exhibit. Today, there is still tension between the design of exhibits for educational purposes or for the purpose of attracting and entertaining an audience, as a tourist attraction.\n\nArt exhibitions include an array of artifacts from countless forms of human making: paintings, drawings, crafts, sculpture, video installations, sound installations, performances, interactive art, etc. Art exhibitions may focus on one artist, one group, one genre, one theme or one collection; or may be organized by curators, selected by juries, or show any artwork submitted.\n\nFine arts exhibitions typically highlight works of art with generous space and lighting, supplying information through labels or audioguides designed to be unobtrusive to the art itself.\n\nExhibitions may occur in series or periodically, as in the case with Biennales, triennials and quadrennials. The first art exhibition to be called a blockbuster was allegedly the 1960 Picasso show at Tate in London.\n\nInterpretive exhibitions are exhibitions that require more context to explain the items being displayed. This is generally true of exhibitions devoted to scientific and historical themes, where text, dioramas, charts, maps and interactive displays may provide necessary explanation of background and concepts. Interpretive exhibitions generally require more text and more graphics than fine art exhibitions do.\n\nThe topics of interpretive graphics cover a wide range including archaeology, anthropology, ethnology, history, science, technology and natural history.\n\nCommercial exhibitions, generally called trade fairs, trade shows or expos, are usually organized so that organizations in a specific interest or industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products, service, study activities of rivals and examine recent trends and opportunities. Some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade) and members of the press.\n\nChanges in scholarly communication and the rise of the Internet have led to the creation of online exhibitions or digital exhibitions. These can include the digital viewing of physical exhibits; video tours of museums, art galleries and other cultural venues; and/or online exhibitions of \"born digital\" art, models or educational tools. The integration of information technology into museums and archives has also created opportunities for interactive and multimedia experiences inside cultural institutions. Many museums and galleries have extensive online resources that complement or enhance their physical exhibits. For example, in 2009, \"Public Poet, Private Man,\" an online exhibit on the work of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, was recognized as an outstanding digital exhibit by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ARCL).\n\n"}

{"id": "50780098", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=50780098", "title": "Gulal", "text": "Gulal\n\nGulal (à¤à¥à¤²à¤¾à¤²), also known as Abeer (à¤à¤¬à¥à¤°), is the traditional name given to the coloured powders used for the typical Hindu rituals, in particular for the Holi festival (though commonly associated with the pink color used in the festival). During this festival, which celebrates love and equality, people throw these powder solutions at each other while singing and dancing.\n\nA legend narrates that Lord Krishna complained to his mother about the darkness of his skin compared to that of his consort Radha. As a result, Krishnaâs mother smeared colours onto Radhaâs face. This explains why today Holi is celebrated by throwing colours on people.\n\nIn earlier times, Gulal powders were prepared from flowers coming from trees, such as the Indian Coral Tree and the Flame of the Forest, that had medicinal properties, beneficial to the skin. After the advent of synthetic dyes in the middle of 19th century, the disappearance of trees in urban areas and the pursuit of higher profits led to the abandonment of natural colours.\nThe new industrial dyes have been manufactured through chemical processes with non-standard parameters and hence the resulting colours are sometimes toxic for face and skin, causing problems such as eye irritation, allergies, skin infection and asthma. Unsafe products have often been sold on the road by small traders, in boxes with labels saying \"for industrial use only\".\n\nRecently, the various harmful effects and concerns for the environment (synthetic powders caused temporary wastewater pollution too) generated awareness and encouraged people to celebrate an eco-friendly Holi. For the preparation of Herbal Gulal, lots of safe dyes can be used, such as Turmeric (Curcuma Longa), Indigo (Indigofera) or Annatto (Bixa Orellana), which are all ingredients easily available on the market at moderate prices. For these reasons, it is also possible to prepare Gulal at home, as suggested by many websites on the Internet.\n\nIn the new natural processes to make Herbal Gulal, no salts of any heavy metal have been used and the combination of ingredients provides a powder having soft and supple touch with good sticking capacities to skin. The production profile of dry colour composition is eco-friendly as no toxic ingredients are released under the preparation. In this way, it has been possible to replace synthetic colours with natural ones. Herbal Gulal can be manufactured at higher scale and people who were scared about synthetic powders can now enjoy rituals with no restrictions.\n\nGulal powder has always had an important role in Hindu culture and has always been used for religious purposes. \nBesides Holi festival, the use of coloured powders appears in other ceremonies, such as funerals. In this case, in some populations, a particular ritual occurs when the deceased is a married man. The widow puts on all the ornaments she possesses and takes leave of her husband adorning him with all her jewels. Holding a small brass plate with coloured powders, she lets the men participating at the ceremony paint the face of the deceased. This ritual is associated with the one of marriage, in which the bridegroom and the bride anoint themselves with coloured powders for four days before the wedding. This ointment, indeed, is meant to prepare their bodies for conjugal life.\n\nOne interesting use of this powder has been developed in the field of latent fingerprints. A study by Punjabi University of Patiala shows that the application of Gulal or food colours to latent fingerprints can give clear results. During this study, few grams of dry colours were taken and sprinkled over different surfaces, such as normal paper, top of CDs, aluminium foil, and aluminium sheet. It has been concluded that commonly and easily available agents are a useful substitute for the decipherment of latent prints.\n\nGulal consumption related to Holi festival has been taken out from the Hindu context and desacralized. The desacralization consists in a distortion of the original meaning of the cultural elements at the base of the Holi ceremony, which has often suffered from a disrespectful treatment. Indeed, in the contemporary Western society, Holi festival has become a phenomenon of consumerism, with no longer religious aspects. Throwing Gulal powder has become something cool and fashionable: everybody can buy this powder online and use it to give to its own party an extra point.\n\nThe main reason why Holi is now so well known outside the Asian continent is the birth of many Holi remakes for commercial purposes. From the beginning of the 2000s, Europeans, Americans, and Australians started to follow the trend of going to parties that involved throwing coloured powders at each other, in a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere. Best examples of these remakes are âFestival of colorsâ and âThe Color Runâ. The latter one, also known as âThe Happiest 5K on the Planetâ and born in 2012, is a further alteration of the original festival, since it consists in a five kilometre paint race. \n\nThis desacralization led to criticisms by natives, because of the over-simplification of one of their most meaningful religious rituals. Moreover, they bemoan the misuse of Holi, the fact that their culture has been profited off, the sexualisation coming from a very inappropriate outfit and the devaluation on social networks. Participants to Holi festival remakes, indeed, generally share their coloured pictures on Facebook or Twitter, using hashtags which can remind of the original meaning of the celebration, but that paradoxically blurs it more and more.\n\nIndian manufacturers of Holi colours are facing huge losses as Chinese alternatives are selling a lot. A survey reported that Chinese products are more innovative and cheaper by up to 55%, comparing to powders manufactured locally in regions like Uttar Pradesh, Rajastan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The invasion of innovative and fancy Chinese products, despite the central government effort to promote âMade in Indiaâ, is making survival difficult for small manufacturer, most of whom have been engaged in this business for decades .\nColdplayâs video âHymn for the weekendâ has been filmed in Mumbai during the Holi festival, using Gulal powder as a central feature. The band has been accused of cultural appropriation.\n\n\n"}

It replaced the Russian Imperial Theater, which operated from 1764 until 1783. The Hermitage Theatre was built between 1783 and 1787 at the behest of Catherine the Great to a Palladian design by Giacomo Quarenghi. The crumbling Third Winter Palace of Peter the Great was demolished to make room for the new structure, although its old foundations are still visible in the ground floor. Quarenghi's designs for the theatre were engraved and published in 1787, earning him a European reputation.\n\nThe semicircular auditorium is decorated with color marble and surrounded with ten niches for statues of Apollo and the muses. As the interior has never been overhauled, the original stage machinery remains in situ, but the elaborate sets, an acclaimed work of the Italian artist Pietro Gonzaga (1751-1831), were lost during the years of Soviet neglect. \n\nThe ceremonial opening of the theatre took place on 22 November 1785. Though the auditorium could seat no more than 250 spectators, it was often overcrowded. Usually, the performance would be attended by several dozen aristocratic spectators, all invited by the monarch herself. As a sign of gratitude, a separate loge was reserved for the architect Quarenghi and his family. In the 19th century, selected members of the diplomatic corps were admitted to the theatre as well.\n\nAlthough the building was used to entertain the imperial family until the Russian Revolution, it came to be viewed as a rare monument to Catherine's personal tastes and affections. The empress brought out several comedies specifically to be staged in this theatre, which also saw the premieres of Domenico Cimarosa's operas composed to her own librettos. As for the costumes, they were chosen from a 15,000-dress personal wardrobe of the late Empress Elizabeth.\n\nMathilde Kschessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Fyodor Chaliapin were among the great artists who performed at the Hermitage Theatre for the last Russian tsar. Among the ballets performed there was the premiere of Marius Petipa's \"Harlequinade\", in 1900. The Bolsheviks closed the theatre and utilised the building for administrative purposes. It was not until 1991 that performances were resumed on this stage, with the likes of Svyatoslav Richter, Mstislav Rostropovich and Yelena Obraztsova appearing as guest stars.\n\n"}

The main event of the show was the eponymous \"Infierno en el Ring\" match that CMLL traditionally has traditionally held approximately once a year and which has headlined its own specific show since 2008. The \"Infierno en el Ring\" match is a multi-person Steel Cage match contested under \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match, rules which means that the loser of the match would be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off per Lucha Libre traditions.

{"id": "18953051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18953051", "title": "Iron Curtain", "text": "Iron Curtain\n\nThe Iron Curtain was the name for the boundary dividing Europe into two separate areas from the end of World War II in 1945 until the end of the Cold War in 1989. The term symbolizes the efforts by the Soviet Union to block itself and its satellite states from open contact with the West and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were allied to the United States or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain: \n\n\nPhysically, the Iron Curtain took the form of border defences between the countries of Europe in the middle of the continent. The most notable border was marked by the Berlin Wall and its Checkpoint Charlie, which served as a symbol of the Curtain as a whole.\n\nThe events that demolished the Iron Curtain started in discontent in Poland, and continued in Hungary, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. Romania became the only communist state in Europe to overthrow its government with violence.\n\nThe use of the term \"iron curtain\" as a metaphor for strict separation goes back at least as far as the early 19th century. It originally referred to fireproof curtains in theaters. Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech Winston Churchill gave on the 5 March 1946 in Fulton, Missouri, German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.\n\nVarious usages of the term \"iron curtain\" (; ; ; Czech and Slovak: Å½eleznÃ¡ opona; ; ; ; ; ; ) pre-date Churchill's use of the phrase. The concept goes back to the Babylonian Talmud of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where Tractate Sota 38b refers to a \"mechitza shel barzel\", an iron barrier or divider: \"××¤××× ××××¦× ×©× ××¨×× ××× × ××¤×¡×§×ª ××× ××©×¨×× ×××××× ×©××©×××\" (Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father).\n\nThe term \"iron curtain\" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses â firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border. The source of these metaphors can refer to either the safety curtain deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1794) or to roller shutters used to secure commercial premises.\n\nThe first metaphorical usage of \"iron curtain\", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author Arthur Machen (1863â1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel \"The Three Impostors\": \"...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life\". The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of \"clang\" with reference to an \"iron curtain\", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.\n\nQueen Elisabeth of the Belgians used the term \"Iron Curtain\" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between Belgium and Germany in 1914.\n\nThe first recorded application of the term to Communist Russia, again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in Vasily Rozanov's 1918 polemic \"The Apocalypse of Our Times\", and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:\n\nThe first English-language use of the term \"iron curtain\" applied to the border of communist Russia in the sense of \"an impenetrable barrier\" was used in 1920 by Ethel Snowden, in her book \"Through Bolshevik Russia\".\n\nG.K. Chesterton used the phrase in a 1924 essay in \"The Illustrated London News\". Chesterton, while defending Distributism, refers to \"that iron curtain of industrialism that has cut us off not only from our neighbours' condition, but even from our own past\".\n\nThe term also appears in the 1933 satirical novel \"England, Their England\"; used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: \"...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down\". Sebastian Haffner used the metaphor in his book \"Germany: Jekyll & Hyde\", published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: \"Back then to March 1933. How, a moment before the iron curtain was wrung down on it, did the German political stage appear?\"\n\nAll German theatres had to install an iron curtain (\"eiserner Vorhang\") as an obligatory precaution to prevent the possibility of fire spreading from the stage to the rest of the theatre. Such fires were rather common because the decor often was very flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters. Douglas Reed used this metaphor in his book \"Disgrace Abounding\": \"The bitter strife [in Yugoslavia between Serb unionists and Croat federalists] had only been hidden by the iron safety-curtain of the King's dictatorship\".\n\nA May 1943 article in \"Signal\", a Nazi illustrated propaganda periodical published in many languages, bore the title \"Behind the Iron Curtain\". It discussed \"the iron curtain that more than ever before separates the world from the Soviet Union\". The German Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his weekly newspaper \"Das Reich\" that if the Nazis should lose the war a Soviet-formed \"iron curtain\" would arise because of agreements made by Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill at the Yalta Conference: \"An iron curtain would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the Soviet Union, behind which nations would be slaughtered\". The first recorded oral intentional mention of an Iron Curtain in the Soviet context occurred in a broadcast by Lutz von Krosigk to the German people on 2 May 1945: \"In the East the iron curtain behind which, unseen by the eyes of the world, the work of destruction goes on, is moving steadily forward\".\n\nChurchill's first recorded use of the term \"iron curtain\" came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President Harry S. Truman regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating \"[a]n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not know what is going on behind\". He was further concerned about \"another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe\". Churchill concluded \"then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland\".\n\nChurchill repeated the words in a further telegram to President Truman on 4 June 1945, in which he protested against such a U.S. retreat to what was earlier designated as, and ultimately became, the U.S. occupation zone, saying the military withdrawal would bring \"Soviet power into the heart of Western Europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward\". At the Potsdam Conference, Churchill complained to Stalin about an \"iron fence\" coming down upon the British Mission in Bucharest.\n\nThe first American print reference to the \"Iron Curtain\" occurred when C.L. Sulzberger of \"The New York Times\" first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by Vladko MaÄek, a Croatian politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. MaÄek told Sulzberger, \"During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia I saw how the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [Yugoslavia] so that nobody could know what went on behind it\".\n\nThe term was first used in the British House of Commons by Churchill on 16 August 1945 when he stated \"it is not impossible that tragedy on a prodigious scale is unfolding itself behind the iron curtain which at the moment divides Europe in twain\".\n\nAllen Dulles used the term in a speech on 3 December 1945, referring to only Germany, following his conclusion that \"in general the Russians are acting little better than thugs\", had \"wiped out all the liquid assets\", and refused to issue food cards to emigrating Germans, leaving them \"often more dead than alive\". Dulles concluded that \"[a]n iron curtain has descended over the fate of these people and very likely conditions are truly terrible. The promises at Yalta to the contrary, probably 8 to 10 million people are being enslaved\".\n\nThe antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West that came to be described as the \"iron curtain\" had various origins.\n\nDuring the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations both with a British-French group and with Nazi Germany regarding potential military and political agreements, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed the GermanâSoviet Commercial Agreement (which provided for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials) and the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact (signed in late August 1939), named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries (Vyacheslav Molotov and Joachim von Ribbentrop), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.\n\nThe Soviets thereafter occupied Eastern Poland (September 1939), Latvia (June 1940), Lithuania (1940), northern Romania (Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, late June 1940), Estonia (1940) and eastern Finland (March 1940). From August 1939, relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany engaged in an extensive economic relationship by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other materials in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology. NaziâSoviet trade ended in June 1941 when Germany broke the Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.\n\nIn the course of World War II, Stalin determined to acquire a buffer area against Germany, with pro-Soviet states on its border in an Eastern bloc. Stalin's aims led to strained relations at the Yalta Conference (February 1945) and the subsequent Potsdam Conference (August 1945). People in the West expressed opposition to Soviet domination over the buffer states, and the fear grew that the Soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests.\n\nNonetheless, at the Potsdam Conference, the Allies assigned parts of Poland, Finland, Romania, Germany, and the Balkans to Soviet control or influence. In return, Stalin promised the Western Allies that he would allow those territories the right to national self-determination. Despite Soviet cooperation during the war, these concessions left many in the West uneasy. In particular, Churchill feared that the United States might return to its pre-war isolationism, leaving the exhausted European states unable to resist Soviet demands. (President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced at Yalta that after the defeat of Germany, U.S. forces would withdraw from Europe within two years.)\n\nWinston Churchill's of 5 March 1946, at Westminster College, used the term \"iron curtain\" in the context of Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:\n\nFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.\n\nMuch of the Western public still regarded the Soviet Union as a close ally in the context of the recent defeat of Nazi Germany and of Imperial Japan. Although not well received at the time, the phrase \"iron curtain\" gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.\n\nChurchill's \"Sinews of Peace\" address was to strongly criticise the Soviet Union's exclusive and secretive tension policies along with the Eastern Europe's state form, Police State (\"Polizeistaat\"). He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II. In September that year, US-Soviet Union cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the Stuttgart Council, and then followed the announcement by US President, Harry S. Truman, of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy. After that the phrase became more widely used as anti-Soviet term in the West.\n\nIn addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction. He asserted that in order to put a brake on this ongoing phenomenon, the commanding force of and strong unity between the UK and the US was necessary.\n\nStalin took note of Churchill's speech and responded in \"Pravda\" soon afterward. He accused Churchill of warmongering, and defended Soviet \"friendship\" with eastern European states as a necessary safeguard against another invasion. He further accused Churchill of hoping to install right-wing governments in eastern Europe with the goal of agitating those states against the Soviet Union. Andrei Zhdanov, Stalin's chief propagandist, used the term against the West in an August 1946 speech:\n\nWhile the Iron Curtain remained in place, much of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe (except West Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Austria) found themselves under the hegemony of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union annexed:\n\nas Soviet Socialist Republics within the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.\n\nGermany effectively gave Moscow a free hand in much of these territories in the MolotovâRibbentrop Pact of 1939, signed before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941.\n\nOther Soviet-annexed territories included:\n\n\nBetween 1945 and 1949 the Soviets converted the following areas into Soviet satellite states:\n\n\nSoviet-installed governments ruled the Eastern Bloc countries, with the exception of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which retained its full independence.\n\nThe majority of European states to the east of the Iron Curtain developed their own international economic and military alliances, such as COMECON and the Warsaw Pact.\n\nTo the west of the Iron Curtain, the countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe â along with Austria, West Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland â operated market economies. With the exception of a period of fascism in Spain (until 1975) and Portugal (until 1974) and a military dictatorship in Greece (1967â1974), democratic governments ruled these countries.\n\nMost of the states of Europe to the west of the Iron Curtain â with the exception of neutral Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Sweden, Finland, Malta and Republic of Ireland â allied themselves with the United States and Canada within NATO. Economically, the European Community and the European Free Trade Association represented Western counterparts to COMECON. Most of the nominally neutral states were economically closer to the United States than they were to the Warsaw Pact.\n\nIn January 1947 Harry Truman appointed General George Marshall as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067 (which embodied the Morgenthau Plan) and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\" Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.\n\nAfter five and a half weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned. Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems. The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer. In a 5 June 1947 speech, Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the Marshall Plan.\n\nStalin opposed the Marshall Plan. He had built up the Eastern Bloc protective belt of Soviet-controlled nations on his Western border, and wanted to maintain this buffer zone of states combined with a weakened Germany under Soviet control. Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet Eastern bloc countries of the newly formed Cominform from accepting Marshall Plan aid. In Czechoslovakia, that required a Soviet-backed Czechoslovak coup d'Ã©tat of 1948, the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.\n\nRelations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the U.S. State Department also published a collection of documents titled \"Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939 â 1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office\", which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of Nazi Germany revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe, the 1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement, and discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power. In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published \"Falsifiers of History\", a Stalin-edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.\n\nAfter the Marshall Plan, the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased Reichsmark and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to Berlin, initiating the Berlin Blockade, which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin. Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors. A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.\n\n<if (this == true || this == false) {\nreturn false \nmessageBox.text (\"unavaible to reach the side\")>\n\nOne of the conclusions of the Yalta Conference was that the western Allies would return all Soviet citizens who found themselves in their zones to the Soviet Union. This affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war (branded as traitors), forced laborers, anti-Soviet collaborators with the Germans, and anti-communist refugees.\n\nMigration from east to west of the Iron Curtain, except under limited circumstances, was effectively halted after 1950. Before 1950, over 15 million people (mainly ethnic Germans) emigrated from Soviet-occupied eastern European countries to the west in the five years immediately following World War II. However, restrictions implemented during the Cold War stopped most East-West migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990. More than 75% of those emigrating from Eastern Bloc countries between 1950 and 1990 did so under bilateral agreements for \"ethnic migration.\"\n\nAbout 10% were refugees permitted to emigrate under the Geneva Convention of 1951. Most Soviets allowed to leave during this time period were ethnic Jews permitted to emigrate to Israel after a series of embarrassing defections in 1970 caused the Soviets to open very limited ethnic emigrations. The fall of the Iron Curtain was accompanied by a massive rise in European East-West migration.\n\nThe Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe. There were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called \"inner German border\" â commonly known as \"die Grenze\" in German â between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the Berlin Wall was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier â between the actual borderline and the barrier â was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.\nSeveral villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example Erlebach. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and a total of 28 East German border guards and several hundred civilians were killed between 1948 â 1981 (some may have been victims of \"friendly fire\" by their own side).\n\nElsewhere along the border between West and East, the defense works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.\n\nThose who lived within the border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed from the border. The space between the two fences were laden with land mines. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.\n\nRegular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.\n\nIn parts of Czechoslovakia, the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.\n\nThe Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border to Norway and Finland. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.\n\nIn Greece, a highly militarised area called the \"ÎÏÎ¹ÏÎ·ÏÎ¿ÏÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î· ÎÏÎ½Î·\" (\"Surveillance Area\") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this 25Â km wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than 60 m and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the Pomaks, a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.\n\nThe Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the foreign ministers of Austria and Hungary, Alois Mock and Gyula Horn, ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.\n\nThe creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to \"de facto\" nature reserves and created a wildlife corridor across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a European Green Belt nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a long-distance cycling route along the length of the former border called the Iron Curtain Trail (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is long and spans from Finland to Greece.\n\nThe term \"Iron Curtain\" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the Bamboo Curtain). The border between North Korea and South Korea is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.\n\nFollowing a period of economic and political stagnation under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in Eastern Bloc politics. Mikhail Gorbachev (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the \"Sinatra Doctrine\". He also initiated the policies of \"glasnost\" (openness) and \"perestroika\" (economic restructuring). A wave of Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc in 1989.\n\nAfter receiving an informal clearance from Gorbachev (who said \"there will not be a new 1956\") on March 3. 1989, on May 2 of the same year the Hungarian government announced and started in Rajka (in the locality known as the \"city of three borders\", on the border with Austria and Czechoslovakia) the destruction of the Iron Curtain, whose last section will be demolished with an official ceremony, attended by the highest authorities of the Federal Republic of Austria, on 27 June 1989, which had the function of calling all European peoples still under the yoke of the national-communist regimes to freedom.\n\nIn April 1989 the People's Republic of Poland legalised the Solidarity organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June. These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of peaceful anti-communist revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe that eventually culminated in the fall of communism.\n\nOn 19 August 1989, more than 600 East Germans attending the \"Pan-European Picnic\" on the Hungarian border broke through the Iron Curtain and fled into Austria. Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the Hungarian parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.\n\nThe legislation transformed Hungary from a People's Republic into the Republic of Hungary, guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in East Germany and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of East Berliners flooded checkpoints along the Berlin Wall, crossing into West Berlin.\n\nIn the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader Todor Zhivkov was ousted. In the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the Velvet Revolution.\n\nIn the Socialist Republic of Romania, on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler Nicolae CeauÅescu, who was executed after a brief trial three days later. In the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.\n\nThe Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. In July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the West German currency, all border-controls ceased and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.\n\nThere is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately . A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used Czechoslovak border fortifications in defence against Adolf Hitler, and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.\n\nAnother monument is located in FertÅrÃ¡kos, Hungary, at the site of the Pan-European Picnic. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by Gabriela von Habsburg. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: \"In necessariis unitas â in dubiis libertas â in omnibus caritas.\" (Unity in unavoidable matters â freedom in doubtful matters â love in all things.) The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\n\nAnother monument is located in the village of DevÃ­n, now part of Bratislava, Slovakia, at the confluence of the Danube and Morava rivers.\nAnother monument is located in FertÅrÃ¡kos, Hungary, at the site of the Pan-European Picnic. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by Gabriela von Habsburg. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants.

The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.\n\nThere are several open air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in MÃ¶dlareuth, a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many other places along the \"Grenze\".\n\nThroughout the Cold War the term \"curtain\" would become a common euphemism for boundaries â physical or ideological â between communist and capitalist states.\n\n\n\nPost Cold War:\n\nGeography:\n\n\n"}

Heritage Villages are set all over the emirates in order to celebrate this event traditionally. Holidays are given from the National Day until two days later. Air shows are conducted while military processions are held at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre for the rulers of the Emirates, members of the Federal National Council, and Emirati citizens.\n\nThe launch of the UAE began with the consensus of the rulers of the emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Fujairah, and Umm Al Quwain on 2 December 1971 and their agreement to unite. The approved interim constitution regulated the state and determined its goals. On the tenth of February 1972, it was announced that the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was joining the Union to complete the seven Emirates held in a single entity.\n\nIn 1968, Britain declared its willingness to withdraw from all protectorates and colonies of the Eastern Mediterranean, the idea of the Union begun to crystallize at a meeting between Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in the village of Samih border on February 18, 1968 [1] and they agreed that the best way is the union between them and invite the Gulf emirates to this union. The UAE does not celebrate any independence day represented by the British declaration of withdrawing from the area in 1968, it celebrates a union day that happened three years after on 2 December 1971.\n\nEmirates federal constitution approved in principle on the evening of December 1, 1971. The next morning, on December 2, 1971, met seven emirates rulers in the hostel in Dubai. And it approved four of the rulers of the Emirates Post Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the Union while RAK Ruler did not agree at the time. Signed Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujairah, Umm Al Quwain and the rulers of Ajman on donors legitimate constitution for the Union, including independence from Britain. [4]\nAhmed Khalifa Al Suwaidi went out - Sheikh Zayed adviser, was appointed a foreign minister in the first cabinet formation of the state - to announce to the media for the Union. And raising the flag of the State in a hostel in Dubai, which is known today as the \"House of the Union\". [5] [6] and Sheikh Zayed was elected president of the union, and Sheikh Rashid as Vice President of the UAE.\n\nUAE National Day stands for UAE Union Day, the anniversary of the union between the six emirates on 2 December 1971, not an Independence Day commemorating the British withdrawal from the area in 1968.\n\n\n"}

However, there are multiple definitions and interpretations that carry varying degrees of emotional intensity. For example, Merriam-Webster defines \"mutilate\" as \"to cut up or alter radically so as to make imperfect\", but gives a relatively mild example: \"the child mutilated the book with his scissors\". Thus, while the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons noted that the term \"mutilation\" is often an emotive one, having implications in common usage of maiming and disfigurement, they stated that there was no satisfactory alternative term that would suffice for their purposes. Their definition is a narrower one: \"covering all procedures, carried out with or without instruments which involve interference with the sensitive tissues or the bone structure of an animal, and are carried out for non-therapeutic reasons.\" \n\nThe following table contains procedures performed on domesticated animals that may or may not have a purported therapeutic purpose.\n"}

{"id": "177891", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=177891", "title": "Primary source", "text": "Primary source\n\nIn the study of history as an academic discipline, a primary source (also called an original source) is an artifact, document, diary, manuscript, autobiography, recording, or any other source of information that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in library science, and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In journalism, a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.\n\nPrimary sources are distinguished from secondary sources, which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary. A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used. For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. \"Primary\" and \"secondary\" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.\n\nIn scholarly writing, an important objective of classifying sources is to determine their independence and reliability. In contexts such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources and that \"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\" Sreedharan believes that primary sources have the most direct connection to the past and that they \"speak for themselves\" in ways that cannot be captured through the filter of secondary sources.\n\nIn scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources. Though the terms \"primary source\" and \"secondary source\" originated in historiography as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.\n\nIn scientific literature, a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In political history, primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the history of ideas or intellectual history, the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In religious history, the primary sources are religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals.\n\nA study of cultural history could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take archaeological artifacts and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.\n\n\nIn historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.\n\nThe Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:\n\"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.<br>\n\nAlthough many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in archives, libraries, museums, historical societies, and special collections. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the Huntington Library in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The Library of Congress maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are American Memory and Chronicling America. The National Archives and Records Administration also has digital collections in Digital Vaults. The Digital Public Library of America searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The Internet Archive also has primary source materials in many formats.\n\nIn the UK, the National Archives provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the National Archives of Scotland. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.\n\nIn other regions, Europeana has digitized materials from across Europe while the World Digital Library and Flickr Commons have items from all over the world. Trove has primary sources from Australia.\n\nMost primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or finding aid. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as WorldCat, the Library of Congress catalog, the National Archives catalog, and so on.\n\nHistory as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. Arthur Marwick says \"Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history.\" Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be memoirs, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in classical studies, where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.\n\nHistorians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of archives and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.\n\nHowever, primary sources â particularly those from before the 20th century â may have hidden challenges. \"Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret.\" Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.\n\nThe following questions are asked about primary sources:\n\nIn many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and \"if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources.\" In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.\n\nHowever, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be bias and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.\n\nParticipants and eyewitnesses may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate. For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias. As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be censored or altered for propaganda or cover-up purposes. The facts can be distorted to present the opposing sides in a negative light. Barristers are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.\n\nMany sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined. Moreover, the distinction between \"primary\" and \"secondary\" sources is subjective and contextual, so that precise definitions are difficult to make. A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.\n\nIf a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.\n\nWhether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field. For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered \"primary\", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered \"secondary\"\n\nIn some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the \"primary source\" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.\n\nHistorians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called diplomatics.\n\nFor centuries, Popes used the forged Donation of Constantine to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false Anglo-Saxon charters, a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by monasteries and abbeys to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by Sir Edward Dering, who placed false monumental brasses in a parish church. In 1986, Hugh Trevor-Roper \"authenticated\" the Hitler Diaries, which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the UK National Archives in the hope of establishing a false provenance. However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "12827868", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12827868", "title": "Rashidun army", "text": "Rashidun army\n\nThe Rashidun army was the core of the Rashidun Caliphate's armed forces during the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, serving alongside the Rashidun navy. The Rashidun army maintained a high level of discipline, strategic prowess and organization.\n\nIn its time, the Rashidun army was a powerful and very effective force. The size of the Rashidun army was initially 13,000 men in 632, but as the Caliphate expanded, the army gradually grew to 100,000 men by 657. The three most successful generals of the Rashidun army were Khalid ibn al-Walid, who conquered Persian Mesopotamia and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah who conquered Roman Syria, and 'Amr ibn al-'As, who conquered Roman Egypt.\n\nOnly Muslims were allowed to join the Rashidun army as regular soldiers. During the Ridda wars in the reign of Caliph Abu Bakr, the army mainly consisted of the corps from Medina, Mecca and Taif. Later on during the conquest of Iraq in 633 many bedouin corps were recruited as regular soldiers. During the Islamic conquest of Sassanid Persia (633-656), some 12,000 elite Persian soldiers converted to Islam and served later on during the invasion of the empire. During the Muslim conquest of Roman Syria (633-638,) some 4,000 Greek Byzantine soldiers under their commander Joachim (later Abdullah Joachim) converted to Islam and served as regular troops in the conquest of both Anatolia and Egypt. During the conquest of Egypt (641-644), Coptic converts to Islam were recruited. During the conquest of North Africa, Berber converts to Islam were recruited as regular troops, who later made the bulk of the Rashidun army and later the Umayyad army in Africa.\n\nRashidun army relied heavily on their infantry. \"Mubarizun\" were a special part of the Muslim army, composed of the champions. Their role was to undermine the enemy morale by slaying their champions. The infantry would make repeated charges and withdrawals known as \"karr wa farr\", using spears and swords combined with arrow volleys to weaken the enemies and wear them out. However, the main energy had to still be conserved for a counterattack, supported by a cavalry charge, that would make flanking or encircling movements.\nDefensively, the Muslim spearman with their two and a half meter long spears would close ranks, forming a protective wall (\"Tabi'a\") for archers to continue their fire. This close formation stood its ground remarkably well in the first four days of defence in the Battle of Yarmouk.\n\nThe Rashidun cavalry was one of the most successful light cavalry forces, provided it was competently led. It was armed with lances and swords. Initially, the cavalry was used as a reserve force, with its main role being to attack the enemy once they were weakened by the repeated charges of the infantry. The cavalry would then make flanking or encircling movements against the enemy army, either from the flanks or straight from the center, most likely using a wedge-shaped formation in its attack.\nSome of the best examples of the use of the cavalry force occurred under the command of Khalid ibn Walid in the Battle of Walaja against the Sassanid Persians and in the Battle of Yarmouk against the Byzantines. In both cases the cavalry regiments were initially stationed behind the flanks and center.\nThe proportion of cavalry within the Rashidun forces were initially limited to less than 20% due to the inability of the poor economic condition and arid climate of the Arabian Peninsula to support large numbers of warhorses. As the wealthy lands of the Near East were conquered, many Arab warriors acquired horses as booty or tribute, so that by the end of the Rashidun period half of the \"Jund\" forces were composed of cavalry. \nMounted archery was initially not used by the Rashidun cavalry unlike their Byzantine and Persian opponents, this not being a traditional Arab fighting method. As the conquest of Persia progressed, some Sassanid gentry converted into Islam and joined the Rashidun cause; these \"Asawira\" were very highly regarded due to their skill as heavy cavalrymen as well as mounted archers.\n\nReconstructing the military equipment of early Muslim armies is problematic. Compared with Roman armiesâor, indeed, later medieval Muslim armiesâthe range of visual representation is very small, often imprecise and difficult to date. Physically very little material evidence has survived and again, much of it is difficult to date.\n\nMuslim headgear included gilded helmetsâboth pointed and roundedâsimilar to that of the silver helmets of the Sassanid Empire. The rounded helmet, referred to as ââBaidahââ (\"Egg\"), was a standard early Byzantine type composed of two pieces. The pointed helmet was a segmented Central Asian type known as ââTarikahââ. Mail armour was commonly used to protect the face and neck, either as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif like how it was used by Romano-Byzantine armies since 5th century. The face was often half covered with the tail of a turban that also served as protection against the strong desert winds.\n\nHardened leather scale or lamellar armour was produced in Yemen, Iraq and along the Persian gulf coast. Mail armour was preferred and became more common later during the conquest of neighbouring empires, often being captured as part of the booty. It was known as \"Dir,\" and was opened part-way down the chest. To avoid rusting it was polished and stored in a mixture of dust and oil.\nInfantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen.\n\nLarge wooden or wickerwork shields were in use, but most shields were made of leather. For this purpose, the hides of camels and cows was used and it would be anointed, a practice since ancient Hebrew times. During the invasion of the Levant, Byzantine soldiers extensively used elephant hide shields, which were probably captured and used by the Rashidun army.\n\nLong spears were locally made with the reeds of the Persian gulf coast. The reeds were similar to that of bamboo.\n\nThe sword was the most prestigious weapon of the early Muslims. High quality swords were made in Yemen from Indian \"wootz\" steel., while inferior swords were made throughout Arabia. Both the short Arab swords (similar to the Roman gladius) and Sassanid long swords were used and Rashidun horsemen as well as foot soldiers were often described as carrying both at the same time.\nAll swords hung from a baldric.\nAnother personal weapon was the dagger, a weapon used only as a last resort.\n\nBows were locally made in various parts of Arabia; the most typical were the hijazi bows. It could be one piece of wood or two pieces joined together back to back. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow used to be about 150 meters. Early Muslim archers were infantry archers.\n\nCatapults were used extensively in siege operations. Under Caliph Umar siege towers, called Dababah were also employed. These wooden towers moved on wheels and were several stories tall. They were driven up to the foot of the besieged fortification and then the walls were pierced with a battering ram. Archers guarded the ram and the soldiers who moved it.\n\nCaliph Umar was the first Muslim ruler to organize the army as a state department. This reform was introduced in 637 AD A beginning was made with the Quraish and the Ansars and the system was gradually extended to the whole of Arabia and to Muslims of conquered lands. A register of all adults who could be called to war was prepared, and a scale of salaries was fixed. \nAll registered men were liable for military service. They were divided into two categories, namely: \n\nThe pay was given in the beginning of the month of Muharram. The allowances were paid during the harvesting season.\nThe armies of the Caliphs were mostly paid in cash salaries. In contrast to many post-Roman polities in Europe, grants of land, or rights to collect taxes directly from the people within one's grant of land, were of only minor importance. A major consequence of this was that the army directly depended on the state for its subsistence which, in turn, meant that the military had to control the state apparatus.\n\nWhen the army was on the march, it always halted on Fridays. When on march, the day's march was never allowed to be so long as to tire out the troops. The stages were selected with reference to the availability of water and other provisions. The advance was led by an advance guard consisting of a regiment or more. Then came the main body of the army, and this was followed by the women and children and the baggage loaded on camels. At the end of the column moved the rear guard. On long marches the horses were led; but if there was any danger of enemy interference on the march, the horses were mounted, and the cavalry thus formed would act either as the advance guard or the rearguard or move wide on a flank, depending on the direction from which the greatest danger loomed.\n\nWhen on march the army was divided into:\n\n\nThe army was organized on the decimal system.\n\nOn the battlefield the army was divided into sections. These sections were: \n\nEach section was under a commander and was at a distance of about 150 meters from each other. Every tribal unit had its leader called \"arifs\". In such units, there were commanders for each 10, 100 and 1,000 men, the latter-most corresponding to regiments. The grouping of regiments to form larger forces was flexible, varying with the situation. \"Arifs\" were grouped and each group was under a commander called \"amir al-ashar\" and \"amir al-ashars\" were under the command of a section commander, who were under the command of the commander in chief, \"amir al-jaysh\".\n\nOther components of the army were: \n\nIt was one of the most highly developed departments of the army which proved helpful in most of the campaigns. The espionage (Ø¬Ø§Ø³ÙØ³ÙØ©) and intelligence services were first organised by Muslim general Khalid ibn Walid during his campaign to Iraq. Later, when he was transferred to the Syrian front he organized the espionage department there as well.\n\nThe basic strategy of early Muslim armies setting out to conquer foreign land was to exploit every possible drawback of the enemy army in order to achieve victory with minimum losses as the Rashidun army, quality-wise and strength-wise, was sub-standard to the Sassanid Persian army and the Byzantine army. Khalid ibn Walid, the first Muslim general of the Rashidun Caliphate to conduct a conquest in foreign land, during his campaign against the Sassanid Persian Empire (\"Iraq 633 - 634\") and Byzantine Empire (\"Syria 634 - 638\") developed brilliant tactics that he used effectively against both the Sassanid army and the Byzantine army. The main drawback of the armies of Sassanid Persian Empire and the Eastern Roman Empire was their lack of mobility. Khalid ibn Walid decided to use the mobility of his own army to exploit the lack thereof in the Sassanid army and Byzantine army. Later the same strategy was adopted by all other Muslim generals throughout the period of military expansion. Though only part of the Rashidun army was actual cavalry, the entire army was camel mounted for movement. Khalid ibn Walid and then later Muslim generals were also able to make use of the fine fighting quality of the Muslim soldiers, the bulk of whom were bedouins and adept in swordsmanship.\n\nThe Muslims' light cavalry during the later years of the Islamic conquest of Levant became the most powerful section of the army. The best use of this lightly armed and fast moving cavalry was revealed at the Battle of Yarmouk (636 A.D) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the campaign in Iraq and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name tulaiha mutaharrika ( ÙØªØ­Ø±Ù Ø·ÙÙØ¹Ø© ), or the \"mobile guard\". This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that gave it an upper hand when maneuvering against any Byzantine army. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.\n\nAnother remarkable strategy developed by Al-Muthanna and later followed by other Muslim generals was not moving far from the desert so long as there were opposing forces within striking distance of its rear. The idea was to fight the battles close to the desert, with safe escape routes open in case of defeat. The desert was not only a haven of security into which the Sassanid army and Byzantine army would not venture, but also a region of free, fast movement in which their camel mounted troops could move easily and rapidly to any destination that they chose. Following this same strategy during the conquest of Iraq and Syria, Khalid ibn Walid did not engage his army deep into Iraq and Syria until the opposing army had lost its ability to threaten his routes to the desert. Another possible advantage of always keeping a desert at the rear was easy communication and reinforcement.\n\nOnce the Byzantines were weakened and the Sassanids effectively destroyed, the later Rashidun generals were free to use any strategy and tactics to overpower the opposing forces but they mainly relied on the mobility of their troops to prevent the concentration of enemy troops in large numbers.\n\nThe basic principle in the Qur'an for fighting is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate self-defense, to aid other Muslims and after a violation of the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist. During his life, Muhammad gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the conduct of war. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, Abu Bakr, in the form of ten rules for the Rashidun army:\n\nThese injunctions were honored by the second caliph, Umar, during whose reign (634â644) important Muslim conquests took place. In addition, during the Battle of Siffin, the caliph Ali stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy. In addition to the Rashidun Caliphs, hadiths attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the Muslim conquest of Egypt:\n\n\n"}

Steven Jones distinguishes these sites from those that collect galleries of shocking content, such as Rotten.com, as the gallery sites must be searched for content.\n\nSome shock sites have also gained their own subcultures and have become internet memes on their own. Goatse.cx featured a page devoted to fan-submitted artwork and tributes to the site's hello.jpg, and a parody of the image was unwittingly shown by a BBC newscast as an alternative for for the 2012 Summer Olympics. A 2007 shock video known as \"2 Girls 1 Cup\" also quickly became an Internet phenomenon, with videos of reactions, homages, and parodies widely posted on video sharing sites such as YouTube.\n\nBestGore is notorious for its extremely graphic content, such as photos and videos of murders, suicides and violent accidents. It is currently the most visited shock website in the world, with an estimated 15â20 million monthly visits. In July 2013, the website's creator, Slovakian-Canadian Mark Marek, was charged with one count of \"corrupting morals\", related to his posting of the video of the murder of Lin Jun on his website. He pleaded guilty and was given a six-month conditional sentence.\n\nGoatse was one of the best-known shock sites, featuring an image of a man stretching his anus with his hands.

{"id": "20954277", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20954277", "title": "Spanish American wars of independence", "text": "Spanish American wars of independence\n\nThe Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America with the aim of political independence that took place during the early 19th century, after the French invasion of Spain during Europe's Napoleonic Wars. Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American (\"creole\") identity separate from that of Iberia, political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans, nor was it necessarily inevitable. After the restoration of rule by Ferdinand VII in 1814, and his rejection of the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, the monarchy as well as liberals hardened their stance toward its overseas possessions, and they in turn increasingly sought political independence.\n\nThe violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito in opposing the government of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville. In 1810, numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, \"there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French.\" While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region's autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country.\n\nThese conflicts were fought both as irregular warfare and conventional warfare, and as wars of national liberation and civil wars. The conflicts among the colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the SpanishâAmerican War in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, casta system, the Inquisition, and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. Criollos (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and mestizos (those of mixed American Indian and Spanish blood or culture) replaced Spanish-born appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, conservatives and liberals fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions.\n\nThe events in Spanish America were related to the wars of independence in the former French colony of St-Domingue, Haiti, and the transition to independence in Brazil. Brazil's independence, in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family to flee to Brazil in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the Atlantic Revolutions, including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the Kingdom of Spain and its monarchy during this era.\n\nPolitical independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. \"There was little interest in outright independence.\" As historians R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch note, \"it is all too easy to equate the forces of discontent or even the forces of change with the forces of revolution.\" Since \"by definition, there was no history of independence until it happened,\" when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought.\n\nThere are a number of factors that have been identified. First, increasing control by the Crown of its overseas empire via the Bourbon Reforms of the mid-eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown. The language used to describe the overseas empire shifted from \"kingdoms\" with independent standing with the crown to \"colonies\" subordinate to Spain. In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders, almost all \"peninsulars\", to the royal offices throughout the empire. This meant that Spanish American elites were thwarted in their expectations and ambitions by the crown's upending of long-standing practices of creole access to office holding.\n\nThe regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already expelled the Jesuits in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. Later in the eighteenth century the crown sought to decrease the privileges (\"fueros\") of the clergy, restricting clerical authority to spiritual matters and undermining the power of parish priests, who often acted as agents of the crown in rural parishes. By desacralizing power and frontal attacks on the clergy, the crown, according to William B. Taylor, undermined its own legitimacy, since parish priests had been traditionally the \"natural local representatives of their Catholic king.\"\n\nIn the economic sphere, the crown sought to gain control over church revenues. In a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly in the form of mortgages for haciendas owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates. Shortening the repayment period meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy. The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (\"capellanÃ­as\") that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately. Prominently in Mexico, lower clergy participated in the insurgency for independence with priests Miguel Hidalgo and JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos.\n\nThe reforms had mixed results. In some areasâsuch as Cuba, RÃ­o de la Plata and New Spainâthe reforms had positive effects, improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government. In other areas, the changes in the crown's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals, which at times erupted into open revolts, such as the Revolt of the Comuneros in New Granada and the Rebellion of TÃºpac Amaru II in Peru.\n\nThe loss of high offices to Criollos and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.\n\nOther factors may include Enlightenment thinking and the examples of the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.\n\nThe Peninsular War was the trigger for conflicts in Spanish America in the absence of a legitimate monarch. The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the worldwide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823. Napoleon's capture of the Bourbon monarchs precipitated a political crisis in Spain and Spanish America. Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon's plan to place his brother, Joseph, on the throne, there was no clear solution to the lack of a king. Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy (see Philosophy of Law of Francisco SuÃ¡rez), the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing juntas. The move, however, led to more confusion, since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole. The Junta of Seville, in particular, claimed authority over the overseas empire, because of the province's historic role as the exclusive entrepÃ´t of the empire.\n\nThis impasse was resolved through negotiations between the several juntas in Spain counted with the participation of the Council of Castile, which led to the creation of a main government: the \"Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies\" on September 25, 1808. It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Supreme Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as \"the viceroyalties of New Spain (Mexico), Peru, New Granada, and Buenos Aires, and the independent captaincies general of the island of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Chile, Province of Venezuela, and the Philippines.\" This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta. In particular Quito and Chuquisaca, which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger Viceroyalty of Peru. This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped.\n\nThe escape to CÃ¡diz and the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta on January 29, 1810, because of the reverses suffered after the Battle of OcaÃ±a by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money, set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas. French forces had taken over southern Spain and forced the Supreme Junta to seek refuge in the island-city of CÃ¡diz.\n\nThe Supreme Junta replaced itself with a smaller, five-man council, called the Regency, or the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies. Next, in order to establish a more legitimate government system, the Regency called for the convening of an \"extraordinary and general Cortes of the Spanish Nation\": the \"CÃ¡diz Cortes\". The plan for the election of the Cortes, based on provinces, and not kingdoms, was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province. The CÃ¡diz Cortes was the first national assembly to claim sovereignty in Spain. It represented the abolition of the old kingdoms. The opening session was held on 24 September 1810, in the building now known as the Real Teatro de las Cortes under the siege of French army. It met as one body and its members represented the entire Spanish empire.\n\nMost Spanish Americans saw no reason to recognize a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), Venezuela, Chile and RÃ­o de la Plata (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in Central America. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, Upper Peru (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish \"Cortes\" effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.\n\nThe creation of juntas in Spanish America, such as the \"Junta Suprema de Caracas\" on April 19, 1810, set the stage for the fighting that would afflict the region for the next decade and a half. Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict. On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called \"absolutists\" in the historiography), who did not want to see any innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, Ferdinand VII, their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to promote their agenda publicly and safely. The proponents of independence called themselves patriots, a term which eventually was generally applied to them.\n\nThe idea that independence was not the initial concern is evidenced by the fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810. The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a \"mask of Ferdinand VII\": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail. Nevertheless, even areas such as RÃ­o de la Plata and Chile, which more or less maintained de facto independence from the peninsular authorities, did not declare independence until quite a few years later, in 1816 and 1818, respectively. Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of Miguel Hidalgo. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which declared independence from Spain in 1813. In Central America, attempts at establishing juntas were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the other side of the world, were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.\n\nMajor cities and regional rivalry played an important role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authorityâand in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and RÃ­o de la Plata)âinitiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the \"patria\" in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also led some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with RÃ­o de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in RÃ­o de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.\n\nUnderlying social and racial tensions also had a great impact on the nature of the fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in QuerÃ©taro, who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican BajÃ­o to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant JosÃ© TomÃ¡s Boves formed a powerful, though irregular, royalist army out of the \"Llaneros\", mixed-race slave and plains people, by attacking the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually re-establishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally, in the back country of Upper Peru, the \"republiquetas\" kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers.\n\nIncreasingly violent confrontations developed between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the \"gachupines\" (a disparaging term for \"Peninsulares\"), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and \"Peninsulares\" who had taken refuge at the AlhÃ³ndiga de Granaditas in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign, SimÃ³n BolÃ­var instituted a policy of a war to the death, in which royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral \"Peninsulares\" would be killed, in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan \"Llaneros\" switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.\n\nBy 1815 the general outlines of which areas were controlled by royalists and pro-independence forces were established and a general stalemate set in the war. In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers, most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated guerrilla bands. In New Spain, the two main guerrilla groups were led by Guadalupe Victoria in Puebla and Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca. In northern South America, New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots, under leaders such as SimÃ³n BolÃ­var, Francisco de Paula Santander, Santiago MariÃ±o, Manuel Piar and JosÃ© Antonio PÃ¡ez, carried out campaigns in the vast Orinoco River basin and along the Caribbean coast, often with material aid coming from CuraÃ§ao and Haiti. Also, as mentioned above, in Upper Peru, guerrilla bands controlled the isolated, rural parts of the country.\n\nIn March 1814, following with the collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlanticâthe myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codesâhad been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.\n\nFerdinand's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the \"ancien rÃ©gime\" did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional \"ayuntamientos\" in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.\n\nSpanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.\n\nDuring this period, royalist forces made advances into New Granada, which they controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships. (See, Spanish reconquest of New Granada.) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact on the war. More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.\n\nOverall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were deployed in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, Pablo Morillo, commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the Battle of MaipÃº only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the Battle of Carabobo about a fifth, and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1% was European.\n\nThe American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (\"espaÃ±ol\"), 5,378 Casta and 980 Indigenous soldiers.\nTowards the end of this period the pro-independence forces made two important advances. In the Southern Cone, a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n, became the governor of the Province of Cuyo. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru. San MartÃ­n's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes, which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan MartÃ­n de PueyrredÃ³n became Supreme Director of the United Provinces. In January 1817, San MartÃ­n was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the RÃ­o de la Plata not to move against Chile, San MartÃ­n together with General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme, later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San MartÃ­n had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a war with no quarter, the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane, Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San MartÃ­n and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.\n\nIn northern South America, after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela, SimÃ³n BolÃ­var devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists. Like San MartÃ­n, BolÃ­var personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country, collaborated with pro-independence exiles from that region, and lacked the approval of the Venezuelan congress. Unlike San MartÃ­n, however, BolÃ­var did not have a professionally trained army, but rather a quickly assembled mix of \"Llanero\" guerrillas, New Granadan exiles led by Santander and British recruits. From June to July 1819, using the rainy season as cover, BolÃ­var led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold, forbidding passes of the Andes, with heavy lossesâa quarter of the British Legion perished, as well as many of his \"Llanero\" soldiers, who were not prepared for the nearly 4,000-meter altitudesâbut the gamble paid off. By August BolÃ­var was in control of BogotÃ¡ and its treasury, and gained the support of many in New Granada, which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo. Nevertheless, Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the \"war to the death\" and carried out the execution of thirty-eight royalist officers who had surrendered. With the resources of New Granada, BolÃ­var became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called Colombia (Gran Colombia).\n\nTo counter the advances the pro-independence forces had made in South America, Spain prepared a second, large, expeditionary force in 1819. This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, Rafael Riego, commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in Galicia in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros, and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.\n\nRiego's Revolt had two significant effects on the war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.\n\nIn effect, the Spanish Constitution of 1812 adopted by the Cortes de Cadiz served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind AgustÃ­n de Iturbide, a colonel in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero.\n\nIn January 1821, Iturbide began peace negotiations with Guerrero, suggesting they unite to establish an independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the Plan of Iguala: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, Guadalupe Victoria, joined the alliance, and on March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief Juan O'DonojÃº, who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in Veracruz on July 1, 1821, but he found that royalists held the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and Acapulco. Since at the time that O'DonojÃº had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'DonojÃº proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting Treaty of CÃ³rdoba, which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'DonojÃº became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of CÃ³rdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Iturbide.\n\nCentral America gained its independence along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an Act of Independence was signed in Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.\n\nUnlike in New Spain and Central America, in South America independence was spurred by the pro-independence fighters who had held out for the past half decade. JosÃ© de San MartÃ­n and SimÃ³n BolÃ­var inadvertently led a continent-wide pincer movement from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent. After securing the independence of Chile in 1818, San MartÃ­n concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter Spanish control of those waters and reach the royalist stronghold of Lima. By mid-1820 San MartÃ­n had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from ValparaÃ­so to Paracas in southern Peru. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took Pisco. After this, San MartÃ­n, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San MartÃ­n hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic Peruvian revolt against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San MartÃ­n engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy JoaquÃ­n de la Pezuela, who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the 1812 Constitution and to maintain the unity of the Spanish Monarchy. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in Huacho, in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San MartÃ­n learned that Guayaquil (in Ecuador) had declared independence on October 9.\n\nBolÃ­var, learning about the collapse of the CÃ¡diz expedition, spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela. BolÃ­var was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although BolÃ­var rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the \"ayuntamiento\" of Maracaibo declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation-state of Gran Colombia. Miguel de la Torre, who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when BolÃ­var returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. BolÃ­var could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.\n\nIn Peru, on January 29, 1821, Viceroy Pezuela was deposed in a coup d'Ã©tat by JosÃ© de la Serna, but it would be two months before San MartÃ­n moved his army closer to Lima by sailing it to AncÃ³n. During the next few months San MartÃ­n once again engaged in negotiations, offering the creation of an independent monarchy; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy, so the negotiations came to nothing. By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak, and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands, with Cuzco as new capital of the viceroyalty. On the 12th San MartÃ­n entered Lima, where he was declared \"Protector of the Country\" on July 28, an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state.\n\nTo ensure that the Presidency of Quito became a part of Gran Colombia and did not remain a collection of small, divided republics, BolÃ­var sent aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio JosÃ© de Sucre to Guayaquil in February 1821. For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the Battle of Pichincha on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the Battle of Ica, San MartÃ­n met with SimÃ³n BolÃ­var in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San MartÃ­n decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of \"Rioplatense\" (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the Andean regions of Peru and Upper Peru. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make BolÃ­var head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio OlaÃ±eta, which was an extension of the Liberal Triennium, proved to be the royalists' undoing. La Serna lost control of half of his best army by the beginning of 1824, giving the patriots an opportunity.\n\nUnder the command of BolÃ­var and Sucre, the experienced veterans of the combined army, mainly Colombians, destroyed a royalist army under La Serna's command in the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9, 1824. La Serna's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits. The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of Upper Peru. Following the Battle of Ayacucho, the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of OlaÃ±eta surrendered after he died in Tumusla on April 2, 1825. BolÃ­var tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru, but the Upper Peruvian leadersâmany former royalists, like Casimiro OlaÃ±eta, nephew of General OlaÃ±etaâgathered in a congress under Sucre's auspices supported the country's independence. BolÃ­var left the decision to Sucre, who went along with the congress. Sucre proclaimed Upper Peru's independence in the city which now bears his name on August 6, bringing the main wars of independence to an end.\n\nAs it became clear that there was to be no reversal of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the RÃ­o de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and RÃ­o de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.\n\nThe Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and ChiloÃ© were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel JosÃ© Arizabalo started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier Isidro Barradas led the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The Pincheira brothers moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation.\n\nThe increasing irrelevance of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and the fall of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, but it was not until the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states. Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the SpanishâAmerican War in 1898.\n\nThe nearly decade and a half of wars greatly weakened the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade \"among\" the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico. Cities dependent on seaborne trade like Valdivia plunged into depression as the intracolonial trade system collapsed.\n\nForeign trade policies varied among the new countries, some like the United Provinces of RÃ­o de la Plata and Peru applied initially protectionist policies while Chile was more open to foreign trade while still applying a kind of neomercantilism.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of capital, foreign investmentâin particular from Great Britainâwas courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery. Finally the new nations entered the world economy after the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.\n\nIn addition to improving the economy, the lower social classes also had to be integrated into the new body politic, although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clashâat times on the battlefieldâbetween liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.\n\nIndependence, however, did initiate the abolition of slavery in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.\n\nWomen were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America. Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels. Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother, sister, wives or daughters of the men who were fighting. Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers.\nSome women supported the wars as spies, informants and combatants. Manuela SÃ¡enz was a long term lover of SimÃ³n BolÃ­var and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive. She saved his life on two occasions, nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles. SÃ¡enz followed BolÃ­var and his army through the independence wars and became to be known in Latin America as the âmother of feminism and womenâs emancipation and equal rights.â \nBolÃ­var himself was a supporter of womenâs rights and suffrage in Latin America. It was BolÃ­var who allowed for SÃ¡enz to become the great pioneer of womenâs freedom. He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established. BolÃ­var even made SÃ¡enz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time. Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was Juana Azurduy de Padilla, a mixed-race woman who fought for independence in the RÃ­o de la Plata region. Argentine President Cristina FernÃ¡ndez de Kirchner posthumously promoted her to the rank of general.\n\nAccording to gender stereotypes, women were not meant to be soldiers; only men were supposed to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men. \nWomen were usually identified as victims during the independence wars since the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due to the loss of many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men.\n\nIndependence also did not result in stable political regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries (\"Mexico\", \"Colombia\", \"Ecuador\", \"Bolivia\", \"Argentina\"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between federalism and centralism, which began in independence, continued throughout the rest of the century. Two large states that emerged from the warsâGran Colombia and the Federal Republic of Central Americaâcollapsed after a decade or two, and Argentina would not consolidate politically until the 1860s.\n\nThe wars destroyed the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed the region for centuries, as institutions such as the audiencias were eliminated and many \"Peninsular\" officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many \"Peninsular\" bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.\n\nDespite the fact that the period of the wars of independence itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism because of the lack of well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.\n\n"}

The exhibition was one of the first to focus on contemporary photography in New Zealand, and attracted considerable controversy around the works included by artist Fiona Clark.\n\nThe exhibition was a collaboration between photography organisation PhotoForum and the Manawatu Art Gallery under the director at the time, Luit Bieringa, and based on photos selected by Tom Hutchins, John B. Turner and Gordon H. Brown. It was sponsored by the Queens Elizabeth II Arts Council and Kodak New Zealand. \n\nThe exhibition consisted of 104 works: among the many photographers represented in the exhibition were Ans Westra, Peter Peryer, Murray Hedwig, Glenn Busch and Fiona Clark. David Fowler. The exhibition was scheduled to show in 12 New Zealand art galleries.\n\nTwo works by photographer Fiona Clark included in the exhibition raised objections from members of the public and were later removed from the exhibition. The two black and white images were from a series of ten images, taken by Clark at a dance party at the University of Auckland cafÃ© for Pride Week in 1974. The photographs depict transgender women, and the white paper around the images were inscribed with short texts by a friend of Clark's, including phrases such as 'Arenât you furious you hung up closet queens' and 'How many of you boys would like to suck these tits?'. Following complaints, the works were reviewed by police and not deemed indecent; however, a number of galleries including the Sarjeant Gallery, the Robert McDougall Art Annex, and the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery bowed to pressure from the public and local councillors and withdrew the works from display (in some cases, the works could be viewed in staff offices). The Auckland Art Gallery cancelled the exhibition as a result of the controversy.\n\n\"The Active Eye\" marked an important point in photography's acceptance as a contemporary art form in New Zealand. In the mid 1970s few New Zealand public art galleries collected or showed contemporary photography. \"The Active Eye\", as the first national survey of contemporary photography, is viewed as a turning point in the art form's position in New Zealand art history and art discourse.\n\nThe works shown in \"The Active Eye\" were acquired by the Manawatu Art Gallery (now Te Manawa) as the basis of their contemporary photography collection. A selection were displayed in 2012 in the exhibition \"Now and Then\".\n"}
{"id": "1282407", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1282407", "title": "The Chimes", "text": "The Chimes\n\nThe Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells that Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In, a short novel by Charles Dickens, was written and published in 1844, one year after \"A Christmas Carol\" and one year before \"The Cricket on the Hearth\". It is the second in his series of \"Christmas books\": five short books with strong social and moral messages that he published during the 1840s. In addition to \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"The Cricket on the Hearth\", the Christmas books include \"The Battle of Life\" (1846) and \"The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain\" (1848).\n\nThe book was written in late 1844, during Dickens' year-long visit to Italy. John Forster, his first biographer, records that Dickens, hunting for a title and structure for his next contracted Christmas story, was struck one day by the clamour of the Genoese bells audible from the villa where they were staying.\nTwo days later Forster received a letter from Dickens which read simply: \"\"We have heard THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow!\", and the writing of the book began. Forster describes Dickens' intentions in writing \"The Chimes\" as striking \"a blow for the poor\". \n\nDickens returned to London for a week in December 1844 and gave readings of the finished book to friends prior to publication, to judge its impact. The artist Daniel Maclise, who had contributed two illustrations to \"The Chimes\" and attended two of these events, portrayed the reading of 3 December 1844 in a well-known sketch.\n\nThe chimes are old bells in the church on whose steps Trotty Veck plies his trade. The book is divided into four parts named \"quarters\", after the quarter chimes of a striking clock. (This parallels Dickens naming the parts of \"A Christmas Carol\" \"staves\" â that is \"stanzas\" â and dividing \"The Cricket on the Hearth\" into \"chirps\".)\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Trotty, a poor elderly \"ticket-porter\" or casual messenger, is filled with gloom at the reports of crime and immorality in the newspapers, and wonders whether the working classes are simply wicked by nature. His daughter Meg and her long-time fiancÃ© Richard arrive and announce their decision to marry next day. Trotty hides his misgivings, but their happiness is dispelled by an encounter with the pompous Alderman Cute, plus a political economist and a young gentleman with a nostalgia, all of whom make Trotty, Meg and Richard feel they hardly have a right to exist, let alone marry.\n\nTrotty carries a note for Cute to Sir Joseph Bowley MP, who dispenses charity to the poor in the manner of a paternal dictator. Bowley is ostentatiously settling his debts to ensure a clean start to the new year, and berates Trotty because he owes a few shillings to his local shop which he cannot pay off. Returning home, convinced that he and his fellow poor are naturally ungrateful and have no place in society, Trotty encounters Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his orphaned niece, Lilian. Fern has been accused of vagrancy and wants to visit Cute to set matters straight, but from a conversation overheard at Bowley's house, Trotty is able to warn him that Cute plans to have him arrested and imprisoned. He takes the pair home with him and he and Meg share their meagre food and poor lodging with the visitors. Meg tries to hide her distress, but it seems she has been dissuaded from marrying Richard by her encounter with Cute and the others.\n\nIn the night, the bells seem to call Trotty. Going to the church, he finds the tower door unlocked and climbs to the bellchamber, where he discovers the spirits of the bells and their goblin attendants who reprimand him for losing faith in man's destiny to improve. He is told that he fell from the tower during his climb and is now dead, and Meg's subsequent life must now be an object lesson for him. There follows a series of visions which he is forced to watch, helpless to interfere with the troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian over the subsequent years. Richard descends into alcoholism; Meg eventually marries him in an effort to save him, but he dies ruined, leaving her with a baby. Will is driven in and out of prison by petty laws and restrictions; Lilian turns to prostitution. In the end, destitute, Meg is driven to contemplate drowning herself and her child, thus committing the mortal sins of murder and suicide. The chimes' intention is to teach Trotty that, far from being naturally wicked, mankind is formed to strive for nobler things, and will fall only when crushed and repressed beyond bearing. Trotty breaks down when he sees Meg poised to jump into the river, cries that he has learned his lesson and begs the Chimes to save her, whereupon he finds himself able to touch her and prevent her from jumping.\n\nAt the end of the book, Trotty finds himself awakening at home as if from a dream as the bells ring in the New Year of the day Trotty originally climbed the tower. Meg and Richard have chosen to wed, and all of her friends have spontaneously chosen to provide a wedding feast and celebration. The author explicitly invites the reader to decide if this \"awakening\" is a dream-within-a-dream. The reader must choose between the harsh consequences of the behavior of the upper classes in Trotty's vision, or the happiness of the wedding.\n\n\nThis is a campaigning story like its predecessor \"A Christmas Carol\", written with the intention of swaying readers towards Dickens' moral message. The chimes represent time, and the main themes of the story are summarised in the three wrongs they accuse Trotty of committing:\n\nâ¢ Harking back to a golden age that never was, instead of striving to improve conditions here and now.\n\nâ¢ Believing that individual human joys and sorrows do not matter to a higher power.\n\nâ¢ Condemning those who are fallen and unfortunate, and offering them neither help nor pity.\n\n'Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from goodâgrasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity. And you have done that wrong!'\n\n\"A Christmas Carol\" had been extremely well received the previous year, and \"The Chimes\" aroused public interest and anticipation. Five different stage productions of the book were running within weeks of publication and nearly 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months. It had a high media profile, and was widely reviewed and discussed. Critical opinion was divided; those sympathetic to its social and political message liked the book, but others thought it dangerously radical. The \"Northern Star\" reviewer called Dickens \"the champion of the poor\"; \"John Bull\" rejected his unflattering caricatures of philanthropy. It was certainly a financial success for Dickens, and remained popular for many years, although in the long term its fame was eclipsed by that of \"A Christmas Carol\".\n\nAsking the upper classes to stop interfering with his life and leave him to die, Will Fern makes a bitter reference to the biblical Book of Ruth, deliberately misquoting Ruth's \"Whither thou goest, I will go\" speech.\n\nThe novel's setting is contemporary and the 1840s (the \"Hungry Forties\") were a time of social and political unrest.\n\nTrotty's conviction that poor people are naturally wicked is influenced by an article in his newspaper about a young woman who has tried to drown herself and her child, and this motif returns at the climax of the book, when Meg is driven to contemplate the same course of action. This is a reference to Mary Furley, a destitute young woman sentenced to death in 1844 for infanticide after her desperation not to return to the workhouse led to a suicide attempt in which her child drowned. This case caused great public debate in the late spring of 1844. Dickens took part in the general outcry against the sentence, which was eventually commuted to transportation. Among other works inspired by the Furley case is Thomas Hood's poem \"The Bridge of Sighs\".\n\nAlderman Cute is a parody of Sir Peter Laurie, a Middlesex magistrate, alderman and former Lord Mayor of London, known for his determination to \"put down\" the lower classes and their antisocial behaviour. His remarks on the 1844 Mary Furley case have been cited as one inspiration to Dickens to write \"The Chimes\".\n\nThe unnamed young man who harks back to the \"good old times\" is a reference to the Young England movement. Dickens removed many of these references prior to publication.\n\nIn 1914, the book was made into a silent film, \"The Chimes\", directed by Thomas Bentley.\n\nA musical adaptation of \"The Chimes\" was created in 1992 by Lisa Kofod and Gay Donat Reed, with music by Paul Johnson. A staged reading of this work was produced at The Workhouse Theatre in New York City.\n\n\"The Chimes\" was adapted into a 24-minute clay-animated film in 2000 by Xyzoo Animation. It won a Cine Special Jury award in 2002.\n\nThe Colonial Radio Theatre in Boston produced a full cast radio production of \"The Chimes\" in 2000. This was released on CD by Blackstone Audio in 2007, and re-released by Brilliance Audio in 2011.\n\nIn 2004 a stage adaptation by Les Smith premiered at the Southwark Playhouse.\n\nIn 2015, Audible issued \"The Chimes\" as a free audible book with Christmas well wishes from the company to its subscribers.\n\nOnline editions\n\nFilm\nTheatre\n"}

Raised by his grandfather after his parents both died (mother from a blood clot in the brain, his father from cancer) when he was young., Andy is bullied by his classmates and dominated by his obnoxious best friend Louie. When he turns seventeen, the Andy (who is weak and skinny) begins smoking and suddenly experiences short bursts of what appear, to him, as being super strength. Shortly afterwords, Andy's grandfather provides him with a box containing belongings of his father that he had kept secret. These include a journal, that explain that as a kid, Andy was exposed to experimental hormones by his father to ensure that his son would not be frail and weak like he was. This causes Louie to believe that smoking causes Andy to become super strong. Louis then convinces him to become an amateur super-hero with him as his sidekick.\n\nSeeking to find out more about his father, Andy requests that his aunt send him anything that she might have that belonged to his father. His aunt sends him a box that contains a \"death ray\" that disintegrates anyone shot by its ray.\n\nMuch of the story deals with Andy's relationship with his grandfather, who is suffering from the onset of dementia and his black nurse/aid Delia, who Andy secretly has a crush on. Louie becomes more and more obsessed with having Andy use the death ray to kill local bullies and troublemakers, such as the abusive father of a girl Louie has a crush on. As Louie and Andy drift apart, Andy befriends Sonny, the ex-boyfriend of Louie's sister who attempts to help Andy cope with his grandfather's mental decline.\n\nUltimately, Louie attempts to crush Andy's head in with a rock in order to permanently steal the death ray from him. Andy is forced to kill Andy, disintegrating him as a result. Afterwords, Andy's grandfather is placed into a group home, Andy is given custody of Louie's dog by his family (who do not suspect Andy of foul play), and Andy and the dog are forced to leave school in order to move in with his aunt.\n\nThe story then skips to the early 2000s; Andy is now in his late 40s and is bitter and cynical about life; twice divorced, he has since adopted Louie's nihilistic view on life and the death ray and repeatedly moves from town to town, to avoid suspicion for the murders he commits with the gun. Having used the death ray to murder the men that both of his wives cheated on him with, and having failed at a relationship with his high school crush Dusty, Andy sold the death ray to a pawn shop and moved on with his life. However, after his neighbor's pit bull murdered Louis's dog and then laughs about it, Andy seeks to retrieve the gun and murder his neighbor. Andy convinces Sonny to help him track down the death ray (which Sonny believes is just a toy gun) and along the way, Sonny visits Dusty for Andy and relays an apology to him for unstated incident that ended their budding relationship.\n\nAndy murders his neighbor with the death ray, off-panel and ultimately moves back to the town where he grew up. Once he arrives back to the town, Andy meets the main bully who terrorized him growing up and who, in their last meeting, told Andy that he hoped his grandfather would die from his dementia. Andy resists the urge to murder the now grown up bully, but comments that the bully's now mature and less jerkish behavior was a lie.\n\nThe story ends with a three part epilogue:\n\nThe final set of panels has Andy and his dog watching fireworks in the distance, while repeating a mantra from earlier in the book (during a fantasy sequence where Andy imagines life as a super-hero, with Louie as his sidekick) saying that he will always be available to help a stranger out if they are in trouble.\n\nIn 2012, \"The Death Ray\" won a Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.\n\n"}

It was written and directed by series creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris.\n\nThe film involves four school friends who meet up again for a holiday in Australia, and stars Simon Bird, Joe Thomas, James Buckley and Blake Harrison. In media interviews, the film's writers and actors stated that it was to be an end to the series.\n\n\"The Inbetweeners 2\" was released on 6 August 2014 in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, to positive reception from critics. It surpassed the record of its predecessor for the highest gross on the opening day of a comedy in the UK, with Â£2.75 million, and ended its first weekend with a gross of Â£12.5 million, the largest opening of any film in 2014, then remained on top for a second week. With an overall gross of Â£33.3 million, it was the highest-grossing British film in the domestic market in 2014. On 21 August, it was released in Australia, to a mixed reception, and topped the box office in its opening weekend.\n\nWill, Neil and Jay's girlfriends have all broken up with them since the events of the last film, and Simon is unhappy with his relationship with Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Simon and Will are depressed and ostracised at Sheffield University and University of Bristol respectively; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular nightclub, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This, plus the boys boredom with their current lives in England convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club in Sydney, they find that Jay was lying, and in fact; only works as a toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle Bryanâs front garden, while Will meets Katie- an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her. Simon, intending to break up with the abusive Lucy over Skype is then interrupted by Jay's uncle in the background. Thinking Simon asked her to marry him, she excitedly tells him yes.\nThe next day, the four travel to a youth hostel in Byron Bay, as Will wants to follow Katie there. He attempts to become friends with Ben, one of the backpackers Katie is travelling with, but is unsuccessful when they quickly deduce that he is a tourist, rather than a \"traveller\". When seated around a campfire, it is implied but not revealed that Jay still misses his ex-girlfriend Jane, and has followed her to Australia to try to win her back. Will and Katie hit it off, to Ben's annoyance as Will mocks his guitar playing. Katie drunkenly seduces Will but then unknowingly to him, passes out as they are in bed together and Will is fingering her. A backpacker girl comes in, sees what is happening and thinking that Will had taken advantage of a now unconscious Katie, wrestles him to the ground, and sets off a \"rape alarm\" Will's overprotective mother gave to him.\n\nThe Inbetweeners and the backpackers visit a water park where, Neil accidentally kills a dolphin and Jay gets Simon into trouble with the parents of some children. It is revealed that Jane was working somewhere at the water park and Jay tries to find her, but another member of staff tells him that she has since left for the outback and that he will \"never find her\"; leaving him feeling dejected and he finally reveals to the others his longing to reconnect with Jane. Will takes on Ben in a waterslide race on the condition that the loser must strip naked. Neil, who is suffering from irritable bowels tries to alert Will that he is about to soil himself, to which Will ignores him but Neil defecates down the slide Will has just gone down. Will wins the race against Ben, but Neil's poo lands right on his face, causing him to vomit uncontrollably, making everybody evacuate the pool.\n\nLucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane is working on a stud farm in the remote settlement of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there but Will, trying to become a \"traveller\" instead of a tourist, gets into an argument with Simon and they part ways. Will stays in Byron Bay in the hopes of getting with Katie while the other three head for Birdsville.\n\nWill struggles to fit in with the \"spiritual\" activities of the travellers and discovers that Katie is sleeping with multiple people at once including Ben, launching him into one of his foul-mouthed tirades towards them, which leads Katie into having sex with Ben in the hostel dormitory. Regretting his decision, Will books a flight with a local farmer and reunites with the rest of the group in Birdsville.\n\nTheir car runs out of fuel in the middle of the desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but they are rescued by Jane and her work colleagues. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house in Sydney, the boys find that Jay's father and Will's mother have flown out after hearing of their near-death experience. To Will's abject horror his nemesis Mr. Gilbert (their old head of sixth form) is there too, and is now in a relationship with Will's mother, to the amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she has been cheating with, and is now in a relationship with his university \"best friend\" Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her. The group then drive off to continue travelling in Australia and onto Asia on the journey home.\n\nIn a montage during the final credits, the four boys decide to travel onwards to Vietnam, are seen target-shooting guns in Cambodia and drinking with girls in Thailand; who are then revealed to be ladyboys beneath their skirts. Upon their return to the United Kingdom several months later, they all have grown long hair and have gained the \"backpacker look\", Neil is in a relationship with an older female traveller from the Byron Bay hostel, while Will's mother reveals her engagement to Mr. Gilbert. Will is aghast and attempts to run back onto the plane, but is wrestled to the ground by security.\n\n\nDaisy Ridley's scene was cut from the final version. The film makers wanted to film another scene with her but she was busy making \"\".\n\nAlthough originally intended as an unambiguous ending to the television series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of \"The Inbetweeners Movie\" led to speculation over the possibility of a sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that \"if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elementsÂ ... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed.\" Co-writer Damon Beesley later admitted \"we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back and see it more than once â and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people\". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script.\n\nIain Morris received inspiration for the film from his own experiences as a high school exchange student on Australia's Gold Coast, describing it as \"a place where people go to get drunk, pick some fruit and get drunk again\".\n\nOn 21 August 2012, it was announced that a sequel was in early stages of pre-production. On 8 November, it was announced by series creators Morris and Beesley that a script was being written and it was at \"version 0.5\" On 1 May 2013, it was announced that, although nothing had been signed, a sequel was in the planning stage possibly set in Australia and to be released sometime in 2014.\n\nOn 2 August 2013, the sequel was officially confirmed for release in August 2014. The series' Facebook page revealed on 15 March 2014 that the sequel would be released on 6 August 2014.\n\nOn 9 May 2014, a teaser trailer was released, in which the characters drive through the Outback and call an Aborigine a \"fire wanker\". A second trailer, this time full length, was released on \"The Inbetweeners\" official Facebook page on 18 June, showing more of the storyline.\n\nFilming began in Australia on 7 December 2013, before moving to the UK in January 2014. Part of the film was shot in Marree, South Australia, an isolated Outback settlement without mobile reception or Internet.\n\nBen Palmer, the director of the first \"Inbetweeners\" film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film \"Man Up\", so Morris and Beesley directed \"The Inbetweeners 2\". Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of Morris and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position.\n\nMorris had considered filming the Australian scenes in South Africa due to the comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor. While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey. During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley thought that he was having a heart attack, which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager. Beesley considered it \"the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film\". The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as \"some quite challenging scenes\".\n\nWhen asked whether he ever felt averse to any material in the film due to perceived offence, Morris said that the crew's attitude was \"letâs shoot everything, push it, and then if it feels like too much when weâre watching it, we can always pull it back in the editing room\".\n\nThe film premiered at Leicester Square, London, on 5 August 2014. In attendance were guests including Beverley Knight, Union J and Alex Zane. In Australia it was distributed by Roadshow Entertainment and released on 21 August. The same company took the film to New Zealand a week later.\n\n\"The Inbetweeners 2\" grossed Â£2.75 million on its opening day of 6 August 2014, surpassing its predecessor as the top grossing opening day in the UK for a comedy film. By the end of its first weekend, it topped the UK box office with a gross of Â£12.5 million, surpassing \"\" (Â£11.7 million) as the largest UK opening in 2014; this, however, was less than the Â£13.2 million opening of \"The Inbetweeners Movie\" in 2011. It topped the box office for a second week, in which it grossed Â£9.83 million. In its third week, it fell to second spot behind new release \"Lucy\".\n\nIn its opening week in Australia, the film grossed $3.155 million in Australian dollars, topping the box office and pushing \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" into second place. It fell to second place in its second week, with \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" returning to top spot.\n\nAs of 12 October 2014, the film had made $55,652,783 in the United Kingdom, $6,598,273 in Australia, and $473,316 in New Zealand.\n\nWith an overall gross of Â£33.3 million, \"The Inbetweeners 2\" was the highest grossing British or Irish film in the domestic market in 2014, ahead of \"Paddington\" (Â£27.9 million). It was the third highest grossing of any film in the UK and Ireland in 2014, after \"The Lego Movie\" and \"\".\n\nOf the 37 reviews surveyed by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of reviews were positive. On Metacritic, the film has a 55/100 rating based on 7 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".\n\nRobbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" gave the film four stars out of five, saying \"Perhaps the biggest compliment you could pay the film, apart from that itâs by and large hysterically funny, is that it is unmistakably film-like, with a smoothly arcing plot and gross-out moments staged with the verve and ceremony of an action-movie set-piece.\" In \"The Guardian\", Mike McCahill gave the film three stars. He found fault in its treatment of female characters, saying \"Some of the abundant thought channelled into knob gags could have been diverted towards developing the boys' female counterparts beyond harpies and lust objects\". Unlike Collin, he found \"The Inbetweeners 2\" to resemble a television show more than a film: \"as with the first film, number 2 never quite shakes its resemblance to primetime E4, complete with ad-ready fadeouts and Walkabout interiors...couldn't the vehicles transporting them to the wider world display slightly more ambition?\". Chris Hewitt of \"Empire\" magazine gave the film four stars out of five, summing it up as \"The Fannytastic Four leave us on a poo-flecked, piss-soaked, sun-burned high that more than overcomes its familiar flaws to become a real contender for the yearâs funniest film. Four star wankers\".\n\nA negative review came from Graham Young of the \"Birmingham Mail\", who found the film's humour to be repetitive: \"Damon Beesley and Iain Morris have both directed this sequel which lacks an emotional arc to create momentum...Yes, it can be funny, and youâd have to be a prude not to laugh...But the endless, alliterative phrases for sex and countless in-your-face sight gags dilute the characters and turn the mood wearingly lewd. Like Nick Frostâs \"The Cuban Fury\" [\"sic\"] earlier this year, \"The Inbetweeners 2\" takes a funny premise â and then ruins it.\" Writing in \"The Observer\", Jonathan Romney gave the film two stars out of five, summing it up as \"British TV comedy's favourite Four Stooges take another holiday, resulting in fountainous poo, pee and puke, rampant misogyny, 'ironic' rampant misogyny, rampant 'irony', and that old \"Carry On\" staple, horror of sex (especially among the over-25s)\". He however predicted that on the record of the first film, \"The Inbetweeners 2\" would be a financial success. In \"Time Out\", Tom Huddleston gave the film one star out of five, saying \"âThe Inbetweeners 2â is riddled with contempt: for its characters, for its audience and most notably for the entire female gender. That a film in 2014 can still get away with depicting all women as either dumb, hapless sluts or ball-busting harridans is frankly unbelievable.\"\n\nIn Australia, Matthew Toomey, a film critic for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave \"The Inbetweeners 2\" a B+. He said \"Donât expect a deep, underlying narrative. This is just a bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked meÂ â and thatâs not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious.\" Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film takes a long time to \"get going\" due to a \"silly establishment skit\". However, she concluded that \"there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree\". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it \"the biggest ribbing since \"The Simpsons\" invaded [Australia's] shores\". Although opining that the film was \"slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts\", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide \"challenges \"Caddyshack\" for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag\".\n\nIn the \"Herald Sun\", Leigh Paatsch gave the film one star. He criticised the casting, describing the main characters as \"supposed to be aged about 20 [but] played by blokes who all look as if theyâre 30-plus, and carry on as if theyâre not yet 10\", and also found the film misogynistic, saying \"the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful\". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" concluded \"The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park and a place to get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and an exploration of the comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work\".\n\n\"The Inbetweeners 2\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2014. A DVD edition also including the first film was released at the same time.\n\nThe DVD featured two audio commentaries â one with Morris and Beesley and the other by the four lead actors â in addition to a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The film's release on home media was sponsored by STA Travel, who offered a prize of a holiday to the Australian state of Queensland.\n\nAt its premiere on 5 August 2014, Bird said of the film:\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been \"very adamant\" that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added \"There is a bond there that I think would be a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing\".\n\nIn the same interview, when asked whether the series had finished, both co-creators answered with a simultaneous \"Yes!\". Morris expressed that \"I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There is more than enough Jay in this world\", and Beesley added \"The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point\".\n\nVarious media outlets blamed \"The Inbetweeners 2\" for an increase in a craze of deliberate defecation in swimming pools to distress other guests. They linked the craze, known as \"logging\" or \"Code Brown\", to a scene akin to it in the film.\n\n\n"}

The film was distributed by New Line Cinema and is currently owned by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment via Sony Wonder. It was released theatrically on November 18, 1994, where it received mixed reviews from critics. The film has been followed by seven direct-to-video sequels and is the only film of the series to be theatrical.\n\nThe theme song \"Far Longer than Forever\" is performed by Regina Belle and Jeffrey Osborne. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1995 for Best Original Song.\n\nThe evil sorcerer Rothbart (Jack Palance) is planning to take King William's (Dakin Matthews) kingdom for himself by mastering a type of dark magic known as The Forbidden Arts. Before he can strike, Rothbart is arrested by William's men. Despite calls for his death, King William spares Rothbart's life and banishes him. A hateful Rothbart swears to William that he will get his power back and take everything William owns and loves. William and Queen Uberta (Sandy Duncan) make their children, Odette and Derek, meet every summer, hoping they'll fall in love. When they meet for the first time, the royal children take an immediate dislike for each other, but as the years pass they gradually fall in love.\n\nIn the present time, Derek (Howard McGillin) only expresses love for Odette's (Michelle Nicastro) beauty, and she and her father leave disappointed. On their journey home, they are ambushed by the vengeful Rothbart, who transforms into a \"Great Animal\" with his new powers, kidnapping Odette and fatally injuring William. Derek arrives on the scene and William tells him Great Animal (\"It's not what it seems\"), and that Odette is gone. He dies in Derek's hands. After searching and finding no sign of Odette, the entire kingdom assumes that she's dead. Uberta encourages her son to find another princess, but Derek is determined to find Odette, believing that she still lives. He and his only friend Bromley (Joel McKinnon Miller) practice hunting every day in preparation to face the Great Animal. Elsewhere, Rothbart is keeping Odette at his castle lair at Swan Lake. He has cast a powerful spell that turns Odette into a swan during the day. At night, she can become human temporarily if she is on the lake when the moonlight touches it. Every night, Rothbart asks Odette to marry him so he can rule William's kingdom legally, but she refuses, then the moonlight leaves the lake, and she turns back into a swan. During her captivity, she befriends a turtle named Speed (Steven Wright), a French frog named Jean-Bob (John Cleese), who claims to be a prince, and an Irish puffin (Steve Vinovich).\n\nPuffin and Odette (in her swan form) fly together to find Derek. By chance, they stumble upon Derek in the woods as he is searching for the Great Animal. Derek mistakes Odette for the Great Animal (having deduced that the creature is a shapeshifter), and tries to kill her. The ensuing chase leads Derek to Swan Lake, where he witnesses Odette's change from swan to human when the moon rises. The two share a loving reunion, and Odette tells Derek that the spell can only be broken by a vow of everlasting love. Derek invites Odette to his mother's ball the following night, hoping to declare to the world of his love for her. Derek leaves just as Rothbart arrives and doesn't know the enchanter heard the whole conversation. Rothbart tells Odette that she will never make it to the ball, for there will be \"no moon\" on that night, much to her dismay and sorrow. Later, inside his castle, fearing that Derek's vow would ruin his plans, Rothbart decides to transform his hag sidekick, Bridget, to the point that she appears to be Odette, ensuring that if Derek made the vow to her as the wrong woman, Odette will die. On the night of the ball, Rothbart imprisons Odette (in swan form) in the dungeon of his castle, along with Bromley, whom he had found in the woods the other night. Bridget, in the form of human Odette, arrives at Uberta's ball where she dances with Derek, who is unaware of her true identity.\n\nAt Swan Lake, Puffin, Speed and Jean-Bob manage to free Odette from the dungeon through a duel with two hungry alligators and she flies to Uberta's castle, but is too late. Derek makes the vow of everlasting love to the wrong girl and Rothbart bursts in, revealing to Derek the fake's true form, Bridget. Realizing his mistake, Derek races after Odette back to Swan Lake, where she finally transforms back into her human form. As Derek holds a dying Odette in his arms, she tells him she loves him before losing consciousness. A furious Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding him to undo the spell, but the sorcerer declares to the prince \"Only if you defeat... me!\" Rothbart transforms into the Great Animal, and a battle ensues with Rothbart overpowering Derek. Odette's animal friends return Derek's bow to him, and Bromley, who has also escaped the dungeon, provides Derek with a single arrow. Derek catches and fires the arrow into the Great Animal's heart, killing him.\n\nA heart-broken Derek confesses his love to Odette, and she wakes up, having managed to survive long enough for the sorcerer's defeat; the spell on her is broken. Derek and Odette get married and they, Uberta, King Williamâs servants, Bromley, and the animals move into Rothbart's former castle, where they live happily ever after.\n\nHaving previously directed \"The Fox and the Hound\" (1981) and \"The Black Cauldron\" (1985), Richard Rich was slated to co-direct \"Oliver & Company\" (1988) until he was fired by Disney feature animation president Peter Schneider. Following his departure from Disney, he subsequently formed his own studio, Rich Animation Studios with about 26 employees, in which most of his key employees came from Disney, including the company's marketing chief, Matt Mazer. Subsequently, Jared F. Brown from Living Scriptures, Inc. tapped Rich into producing half-hour animated videos based on the audio cassettes readings of the Book of Mormon.\n\nInspired by the success of Don Bluth's animated films as well as Disney's early-1990s animation renaissance, Rich decided to adapt the German folk tale version of \"Swan Lake\". During production, the script went through twelve drafts over the course of two years. Rich would later attempt to sell his script to several Hollywood studios to no success. Later, Brown struck on the idea on merging Rich Animation Studios, Family Entertainment Network, and Cassette Duplicators Inc., a cassette-duplicating operation in West Valley City, into one production holding company called Nest Family Entertainment.\n\nThe film was created by hand painting cels, a tedious technique which caused Rich and his crew to take over four years to produce the final product. Overall, 275 animators and artists worked throughout the film's production.\n\nDavid Zippel was approached by Richard Rich to compose songs for \"The Swan Princess\", while the score was composed by Lex de Azevedo.\n\nThe theme song \"Far Longer than Forever\" was written by lyricists by de Azevedo and Zippel. In the 1994 animated film, the song was performed by vocalists Liz Callaway (as the singing voice of Princess Odette) and Howard McGillin (as the speaking and singing voice of Prince Derek). In the closing credits, a pop/R&B rendition of the song was performed by recording artists Regina Belle and Jeffrey Osborne. Michelle Nicastro sings a reprise of the song in the 1997 sequel, \"Escape From Castle Mountain.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote \"The melody of 'Far Longer Than Forever'...echoes the first five notes of \"Beauty and the Beast\".\" Everything's Better With Bob deemed it the best song of the film due to being \"void of all daft rhyming schemes that hit the rest of the songs in the film.\" \"The Animated Movie Guide\" noted that the song had a theme of faith. The \"Far Longer Than Forever\" commercial single was jointly released by Sony Wonder and Sony 550 Music. \"MusicHound Soundtracks: The Essential Album Guide to Film, Television and Stage Music\" called the \"seemingly mandatory big ballad\" \"extremely annoying\" due to \"strik[ing] a totally different artistic note\" in the contect of the film's musical landscape. The Motion Picture Guide 1995 Annual: The Films of 1994 said the \"love theme\" was deserving of the Golden Globe. \"Star-News\" deemed the song \"insistent,\" noting that audiences may \"quickly get their fill\" of the tune.\n\n\"Far Longer than Forever\" was nominated for a Golden Globe in 1995 for Best Original Song.\n\nWhen \"The Swan Princess\" was nearing completion, New Line Cinema purchased the distribution rights in the United States while Sony Pictures obtained the foreign distribution rights.\n\nPillsbury partnered with Turner Home Entertainment for a marketing campaign to promote the film's home video release.\n\n\"The Swan Princess\" was originally released on home video on August 1, 1995, by Turner Home Entertainment, and sold over 2.5 million units. In certain European countries, the full \"The Swan Princess\" trilogy was released in a 2-disc double-sided set on February 16, 2004. On March 30, 2004, the film was re-released to mark its 10-year anniversary, with a new cover for the VHS and Special Edition DVD. The Special Edition DVD contains a few extras, including trailers, a read-along feature, a sing-along feature, and games. On August 2, 2005, \"The Swan Princess\" was released as a double-feature DVD with its sequel \"\". In the US the film along with its sequels can be seen in the pan-and-scan ratio, as opposed to the European releases where the film is preserved in its original widescreen aspect ratio. Currently, a Blu-ray version of the film has yet to be announced.\n\nAt the time of its theatrical release, \"The Swan Princess\" received favorable reviews. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three out of four stars, saying \"Despite the comparatively limited resources at his disposal, Richard Rich shows that he understands the recent Disney animated renaissance and can create some of the same magic. The movie isn't in the same league as Disney's big four, and it doesn't have the same crossover appeal to adults, but as family entertainment, it's bright and cheerful, and it has its moments.\" Similarly, Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" said it was a better film than \"The Lion King\", praising its \"fluid, unhurried pace\" and \"lush, original sense of color,\" though deeming the score \"[not] terribly distinctive.\"\n\nBrian Lowry of \"Variety\" said the film was \"technically impressive but rather flat and languid storywise.\" James Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" gave the film 2.5 stars of 4 writing that \"much of \"The Swan Princess\" is trite and uninspired,\" though added \"nevertheless, despite its problems, \"The Swan Princess\" is actually one of the better non-Disney animated productions to come along in a while.\" Gene Siskel of \"The Chicago Tribune\" gave the film two out of four stars writing the film is a \"casually drawn tale of a boring prince and princess tormented by a dull sorcerer. The songs are weak, and no relationship is developed between the principals.\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Swan Princess\" has an approval rating of 50%, based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 5.4/10.\n\n\"The Swan Princess\" received a theatrical release in the United States on November 18, 1994, and only made $2,445,155 on its opening weekend. It eventually had a total domestic gross of $9,771,658 against a $21 million budget, becoming a huge financial disappointment, partly due to struggling competition with a re-release of \"The Lion King\" (1994).\n\nDisney's reissuing of \"The Lion King\" just as this film was being released was seen as \"sabotage\" by \"Variety\".\n\n\n"}

The Poplifugia is a lesser-known festival that was of obscure origin even for the Romans themselves; Macrobius says that it marked a Roman retreat from the Etruscans at Fidenae during the Gallic invasion, and that the Vitulatio commemorated their comeback victory. It was a \"dies religiosus,\" a day of religious prohibition when people were to refrain from undertaking any activity other than attending to basic necessities.\n\nThe verb \"vitulari\" meant to chant or recite a formula with a joyful intonation and rhythm. Macrobius says \"vitulari\" is the equivalent of Greek \"paianizein\" (ÏÎ±Î¹Î±Î½Î¯Î¶ÎµÎ¹Î½), \"to sing a paean,\" a song expressing triumph or thanksgiving. He offers, however, an antiquarian range of etymologies, including one from \"victoria,\" \"victory.\" A goddess Vitula, possibly an invention to explain the name, embodied joy, or perhaps life \"(vita)\". According to Vergil, she received first fruits offerings. One modern explanation relates the word \"Vitulatio\" to \"vitulus,\" \"heifer,\" the animal that served as a ritual scapegoat at Iguvium, as described by the Iguvine Tablets.\n\nBy the late Republic, the Vitulatio, like the other festivals held July 5â8, seems to have been eclipsed by the popularity of the Ludi Apollinares, games \"(ludi)\" held in honor of Apollo July 6â13.\n"}

Although the City Council and the local business community initially opposed it, they now support the event, which brings about 40,000 people to watch. The Hat Fair's organizing and co-ordinating committee, which is also local to the city, has charge over the travelling players who converge from around the country and abroad to perform at the Hat Fair.\n\nThe first Hat Fair emerged from an informal gathering of friends, who tried out their new shows upon audiences, and who were paid by donations of money into a hat â from which practice the 'Hat' Fair got its name. The core group included members of the Winchester-based Attic Theatre Company, founded and directed by mime artist Jonathan Kay, who continues in the role of Founder and Artistic Director of the Hat Fair to the present day. \n\nOver the years, the Hat Fair gained enough status that it was able to obtain funding from regional arts funders and the local authorities, as well as commercial sponsors.\n\nThe aim of the Hat Fair's organizers is to continually raise the standards of UK Street Theatre, and to aid artists in their development from buskers to professional performers, by providing them with hospitality, conducive performing conditions, and, if possible, a small fee for their performances. \n\nEarly fairs involved an evening of cabaret in which some of the best acts were showcased. Gradually, this expanded from one evening to four nights, in addition to a series of workshops aimed at developing local talent, and a street party on the Hat Fair's last night.\n\n"}

Additional ingredients may include white wine, cayenne pepper, lemon juice and orange rind. The sauce is prepared by cooking the ingredients until the mixture reduces and thickens. This garnish is served with meat such as veal, poultry and sometimes eggs.\n\nGypsy sauce (German: Zigeunersauce) may have originated from Ã  la zingara. Gypsy sauce is prepared using many of the same ingredients as Ã  la zingara. Simpler versions of gypsy sauce, including commercial varieties, typically use a lesser amount of ingredients, such as tomato paste, Hungarian paprika, bell peppers and sometimes onion.\n\nÃ la zingara has sometimes been referred to as singara and zingara sauce. Conversely, Ã  la zingara has also been referred to as separate from zingara sauce, such as in the 2009 book \"Dictionary of Food\" authored by Charles Sinclair and published by Bloomsbury Publishing, which has separate entries for Ã  la zingara and zingara sauce, referring to Ã  la zingara as \"\"France\" In the gypsy style, i.e. with ham, tongue, mushrooms and tomatoes\" and zingara sauce as \"\"France\" A sauce for veal and poultry made to a variety of recipes and little used.\"\n\nAn 1869 recipe for blonde veal cutlets with ham Ã  la zingara uses espagnole sauce and ham. The espagnole sauce is cooked with the veal, and then later the fat is skimmed from the sauce, which is then run through a sieve, after which it is served with the dish. An 1858 recipe for veal cutlets a la zingara is similar, with the addition of mushrooms and truffles in the center of the dish surrounding the veal and ham. After the meats are cooked and plated, The espagnole sauce is cooked in the pan the veal was cooked in, lemon juice and cayenne pepper are added, and then the sauce is poured over the cutlets.\n\nGypsy sauce is a sauce or demi-glace sauce used as an ingredient in dishes and as a condiment. The term \"zigeuner\" has been used in Germany for over a century regarding the sauce. Some companies mass-produce it, including Remia, Verstegen and Unilever. Some controversy occurred in 2013 regarding use of the word \"gypsy\" on the labels of commercial varieties of the sauce and at German public building cafeterias.\n\nThe term \"zigeuner\" has been used for over 100 years in Germany in reference to the sauce. This term was used in the 1903 book \"Le guide culinaire\" written by Auguste Escoffier\n\nGypsy sauce is used in Austrian, French and German cuisine.\n\nContemporary gypsy sauce is typically prepared using tomato paste, Hungarian paprika, bell peppers and sometimes onion. It may be prepared as a spicy-hot sauce. Canned whole or crushed tomatoes are sometimes used. Additional ingredients used in its preparation include onion, garlic, chicken broth, milk, a sweetener such as sugar or honey, salt and pepper.\n\nAnother preparation of the sauce includes tomato slices or tomato purÃ©e, onions, smoked tongue, ham, mushrooms, truffles, white wine or Madeira wine, butter, paprika and pepper, which is very similar to the preparation of Ã  la zingara. The simpler preparation of the sauce may have originated from the more complex Ã  la zingara sauce.\n\nGypsy sauce is commercially mass-produced by some companies, such as Remia, Verstegen and Unilever, which is marketed under Unilever's Knorr brand name\n\nGypsy sauce is used in the preparation of \"Zigeunerschnitzel\", a German schnitzel dish.\n\nIn August 2013, a group representing Romani and Sinti peoples called for commercial varieties of the sauce to be renamed, stating that use of the word \"gypsy\" is offensive and discriminatory, and has negative connotations. The group requested that five German food companies rename the sauce, suggesting using the name \"spicy sauce\" or another similar name. Authorities in Hanover, Germany issued an internal memo in October 2013 informing city staffers that they should avoid using the term to describe a type of schnitzel served in the cafeterias of city-run public buildings, instead calling it \"Balkan style\" or \"Budapest style\". During this time, food manufacturers essentially opposed renaming the commercial brands of the sauce. The German Association of Culinary Foodstuffs Manufacturers stated through a spokesperson that the sauce has significant brand recognition under this name, and that the word \"gypsy\" has been used for over 100 years to represent the sauce.\n\n\n"}
