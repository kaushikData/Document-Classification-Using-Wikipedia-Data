It was held in London on 5–6 July 1990. The principal outcome of the summit was the \"London Declaration on a Transformed North Atlantic Alliance\".\n\nThe declaration, shaped in the midst of a changing Europe, called for substantial changes in the organization to ensure it could adapt to a rapidly evolving political landscape. Additionally, the declaration called for reductions in short-range nuclear capabilities, and re-focusing its long-term strategic plans with associated changes to the structure and quantity of its military.\n\nNotably, the declaration also reinforced a message given days earlier stating that NATO no longer saw the Warsaw Pact countries as enemies, and opening up channels for communication and aid with the former eastern bloc states. NATO extended a \"hand of friendship\" to eastern European nations.\n\nOne year later, on 20 December 1991, NATO and former members of the Warsaw Pact formed the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), now called the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.\n"}

By the end of 1990 in the run-up to the Gulf War, the situation became so serious that the Indian foreign exchange reserves could barely finance three weeks’ worth of imports while the government came close to defaulting on its financial obligations. By July that year, the low reserves had led to a sharp devaluation of the rupee, which in turn exacerbated the twin deficit problem. \n\nThis led the Indian government to airlift national gold reserves as a pledge to a large conditional bail out from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in exchange for a loan to cover balance of payment debts.\n\nThe crisis led to the liberalisation of the Indian economy, as one of the conditions stipulated in the World Bank loan (structural reform), requiring India to open itself up to participation from foreign entities in its industries, including state owned enterprises.\n\nThe crisis was caused by currency devaluation; the current account deficit, and investor confidence played significant role in the sharp exchange rate depreciation.\n\nThe economic crisis was primarily due to the large and growing fiscal imbalances over the 1980s. During the mid-eighties, India started having balance of payments problems. Precipitated by the Gulf War, India’s oil import bill swelled, exports slumped, credit dried up, and investors took their money out. Large fiscal deficits, over time, had a spillover effect on the trade deficit culminating in an external payments crisis. By the end of the 1980s, India was in serious economic trouble.\n\nThe gross fiscal deficit of the government (centre and states) rose from 9.0 percent of GDP in 1980-81 to 10.4 percent in 1985-86 and to 12.7 percent in 1990-91. For the centre alone, the gross fiscal deficit rose from 6.1 percent of GDP in 1980-81 to 8.3 percent in 1985-86 and to 8.4 percent in 1990-91. Since these deficits had to be met by borrowings, the internal debt of the government accumulated rapidly, rising from 35 percent of GDP at the end of 1980-81 to 53 percent of GDP at the end of 1990-91. The foreign exchange reserves had dried up to the point that India could barely finance three weeks worth of imports.\n\nIn mid-1991, India's exchange rate was subjected to a severe adjustment. This event began with a slide in the value of the Indian rupee leading up to mid-1991. The authorities at the Reserve Bank of India took partial action, defending the currency by expanding international reserves and slowing the decline in value. However, in mid-1991, with foreign reserves nearly depleted, the Indian government permitted a sharp devaluation that took place in two steps within three days (1 July and 3 July 1991) against major currencies.\n\nWith India’s foreign exchange reserves at $1.2 billion in January 1991 and depleted by half by June, barely enough to last for roughly 3 weeks of essential imports, India was only weeks away from defaulting on its external balance of payment obligations.\n\nGovernment of India's immediate response was to secure an emergency loan of $2.2 billion from the International Monetary Fund by pledging 67 tons of India's gold reserves as collateral security. The Reserve Bank of India had to airlift 47 tons of gold to the Bank of England and 20 tons of gold to the Union Bank of Switzerland to raise $600 million. National sentiments were outraged and there was public outcry when it was learned that the government had pledged the country's entire gold reserves against the loan. It was later revealed that the van transporting the gold to the airport broke down en route and panic followed. A chartered plane ferried the precious cargo to London between 21 May and 31 May 1991, jolting the country out of an economic slumber. The Chandra Shekhar government had collapsed a few months after having authorised the airlift. The move helped tide over the balance of payment crisis and kick-started P.V. Narasimha Rao’s economic reform process.\n\nP. V. Narasimha Rao took over as Prime Minister in June, and roped in Manmohan Singh as Finance Minister. The Narasimha Rao government ushered in several reforms that are collectively termed as liberalisation in the Indian media. There was significant opposition to such reforms, suggesting they were an \"interference with India's autonomy\". Then Prime Minister Rao's speech a week after he took office highlighted the necessity for reforms, as New York Times reported, \"Mr. Rao, who was sworn in as Prime Minister last week, has already sent a signal to the nation—as well as the I.M.F.—that India faced no \"soft options\" and must open the door to foreign investment, reduce red tape that often cripples initiative, and streamline industrial policy. Mr. Rao made his comments in a speech to the nation Saturday night.\" The foreign reserves started picking up with the onset of the liberalisation policies and reached an all-time high US$ 426.1 billion as on 13th of April 2018 \n\n18 years after the incident, in 2009, India bought 200 Metric tons of gold from International Monetary Fund,which was nearly three times the amount which India pawned to IMF in 1991 proving the fact that the economic reforms had worked wonders.\nA program of economic policy reform 1991 was put in place which has yielded mixed results so far.\n\n"}

{"id": "48842531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48842531", "title": "Announcerless game", "text": "Announcerless game\n\nThe announcerless game was an American football contest played on December 20, 1980, between the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League. As an experiment, the NBC television network broadcast it without assigning any commentators to cover it. The two teams were playing the last game of that season for them as neither had qualified for the playoffs, and since the game was being broadcast nationally NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer decided on the idea to boost what would otherwise have been weak ratings. The Jets won a 24–17 upset victory.\n\nTo replace the announcers, the network used more on-screen graphics than usual and asked the public address announcer at Miami's Orange Bowl to impart more information than he typically did. Efforts to use more sensitive microphones and pick up more sound from the field, however, did not succeed. While the experiment did increase the telecast's ratings, it was widely regarded as a failure since it did not provide sufficient context for viewers. No network broadcasting any major U.S. professional team sport has ever tried it again, except through alternate feeds of games offered with announcers.\n\nDon Ohlmeyer, then executive producer of NBC's telecasts of National Football League (NFL) games, began considering doing a telecast without announcers early in the 1980 season. He had several reasons. First, he had long believed that the announcers were overly chatty and did not let the game speak for itself when they needed to. Second, NBC, while it primarily covered the games of the NFL's American Football Conference (AFC) teams, generally in smaller markets, was earning ratings almost as good as those of rival CBS, who at the time was broadcasting games involving teams from the National Football Conference (NFC). A game without announcers might well attract enough viewers to put NBC past CBS.\n\nIn October of that year reports began to circulate that Ohlmeyer was considering the idea. He confirmed it but said he would only actually do it for a game that had no playoff implications. The last week of the season gave him the chance, with a contest scheduled for Saturday, when it would be shown nationally, between the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAlthough both teams had already been eliminated from the playoffs, they had reasons to win beyond ending their seasons on an upbeat note. The Dolphins, hosting the Jets at the Orange Bowl, their home stadium at the time, had the better record at 8–7. Las Vegas oddsmakers made them 6-point favorites. Despite that line, however, they had not only lost to the Jets earlier that season, a loss that was widely believed to have been the one that put the Dolphins out of the playoffs since the Jets had been the only team the Dolphins lost to that they had been expected to beat. That loss had been their fifth straight to their AFC East division rivals; Miami had not beaten the Jets since 1977 despite an otherwise superior record during those seasons. The Dolphins were also bringing a three-game winning streak into the contest; a victory would redeem their failure to reach the playoffs with a winning record for the season.\n\nComing into the game at 3–12, the Jets, touted by Jimmy the Greek at the beginning of the season as a possible Super Bowl contender, had long abandoned any hopes of the playoffs. But they, too, had something to prove. The visitors were coming off an embarrassing loss at home to that year's New Orleans Saints, the only team in the league with a worse record, who had come from behind late in the game for their only victory of the season. The team's owners were reportedly divided as to whether to retain head coach Walt Michaels for another season.\n\nReaction was mixed, ranging from \"good-natured humor to applause to some surprising anger,\" as Bryant Gumbel would later put it on air shortly before the telecast started. \"My first reaction was of incredible nerve, nervousness,\" Dick Enberg, one of the NBC announcers, recalled to ESPN 30 years later. \"We all gathered together, hoping that Ohlmeyer was dead wrong ... What if this crazy idea really worked?\" Dolphins' defensive end Bob Baumhower was also apprehensive about what viewers might overhear among the players. \"I hope we're all extra careful,\" he said. \"There's a lot of extra talking going on out there that people don't realize.\"\n\nThe game started at 12:30 p.m. The weather was seasonal for Miami, with temperatures around and winds. A total of 41,854 came to see the game at the Orange Bowl.\n\nMiami took an early lead with a 21-yard Uwe von Schamann field goal. After the Jets' Scott Dierking scored the game's first touchdown on a short plunge into the end zone, Duriel Harris caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from rookie quarterback David Woodley. The first quarter ended with the Dolphins up 10–7.\n\nDierking went in from just outside the end zone once again three seconds before halftime to put the Jets ahead for good. The Jets were weaker offensively the whole game, gaining fewer yards overall and turning over the ball five times. However, it was one of the two Dolphin turnovers that ultimately made the difference in the third quarter, when rookie safety Darrol Ray went 71 yards for a score after intercepting a Woodley pass, his first career interception return for a score. Woodley brought his team to within four with a one-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter; Jets kicker Pat Leahy completed the scoring with a 35-yard field goal. The season ended for both teams with the Jets victorious, 24–17, leaving the Dolphins with a .500 finish.\n\nOhlmeyer and the NBC broadcast crew prepared to compensate for the lack of announcers in several ways. NBC promoted the game by telling viewers they would, in lieu of announcers, have the experience of actually being in the stadium, so the network placed more microphones, and more sensitive microphones, around the field than it otherwise would have. However, the NFL refused to relax one of its restrictions and allow microphones to be placed on the players themselves, which unfortunately meant that it was impossible for viewers to make out signals called by the quarterbacks.\n\nThe network increased its use of on-camera graphics during the game to regularly convey down and distance, score, and statistical information, to the point that more were than had ever been used in any previous NFL telecast. The monochromatic yellow line that was superimposed on the field to indicate the distance needed for a first-down was then the most advanced technology available; however, speaking later from a 21st century perspective, Ohlmeyer said seems like \"troglodyte communication\". The technology of the time would have allowed for a continuous score bug and a running clock, both of which would have eliminated the need to constantly provide that information, but it did not occur to the crew to deploy it that way.\n\nNBC asked Bob Kaufman, the Orange Bowl's public address announcer, to make more frequent announcements of information than usual, and to include more information in those announcements than stadium announcers typically did. Accordingly, he noted aloud during the game that referees were calling for a first-down measurement, and Kaufman gave the length of game time that a drive had taken. Television audiences were able to hear this.\n\nBryant Gumbel introduced the game prior to the kickoff as \"a telecast that figures to be different.\" He was then shown walking into the stadium to watch the game. At frequent intervals, usually every other commercial break, he addressed the camera and gave the audience the score and brief updates as to what had happened and what was happening at that point. His presence was augmented by excerpts from prerecorded interviews with coaches and players, including the Dolphins' Don Shula and Duriel Harris.\n\nAs Ohlmeyer had hoped, the telecast drew higher ratings than it probably otherwise would have. \"It was a dog of a game,\" he recalled to ESPN. \"It did much better for us than [it should have].\" Writing two days later, \"Chicago Tribune\" television columnist David Israel agreed: \"People talked about a game they would otherwise have ignored.\" Of the approximately one thousand phone calls to the NBC switchboard, the network reported later, about 60% were supportive of the decision to go without announcers.\n\nGumbel discounts the importance of that reaction, noting that a thousand callers is not statistically significant when set against the U.S. population of 200 million at that time. \"I thought it was more amusing than anything else,\" he said later. \"I viewed it as kind of a stunt with a small 's'.\"\n\nIn retrospect, Ohlmeyer wished he had cut to Gumbel more frequently than he did. Michael Weisman, who co-produced the telecast, also felt the attempt to provide higher quality audio was unsuccessful. \"There's all sorts of strange noises going on, buzzing and things that sound like a frying pan.\" The technical limitations of television broadcasts also, Israel observed, made it hard for viewers to realize that touchdowns had been scored on two short runs and Harris's catch, since officials were not within the frame.\n\nWithout announcers, David Israel concluded, \"[t]his became a game with no context played by men with no pasts.\" Viewers had to know the backstory of the game themselves to appreciate the human drama on the field. Israel repeated Marshall McLuhan's observation that television conditions viewers to respond passively without engaging them, but: \"here, out of the blue, it was asking us to participate actively, to provide input so that what was on the screen became more than just moving wallpaper. The viewers who were unable to do that were left watching padded humanoids clanking heads\".\n\nTo Gumbel, one moment in the game makes this same point. At the end of the first half, the Jets decided to go for a touchdown and the lead they would never surrender instead of a tying field goal that Leahy would most certainly have made. \"It lacks a degree of drama,\" he observes, \"unless somebody is there to say, 'All right, here's why we're going to shut up and just watch this. Here's what's at stake.'\"\n\nWeisman came to the same conclusion in 2010, saying: \"Early on in the game we realized that we could do whatever we wanted [...] We'd sit around in the truck and say, 'Let's play the tape now.' But it would just come out of the blue and didn't make a lot of sense out of context\".\n\nWhile he and his colleagues were relieved the experiment lasted no further than the one game, Dick Enberg says he did learn from the experience: \"Consciously, to this day, there are moments in every sport that I do when I kind of throw up my hands as if to say to myself and to my partner, 'Let's not talk. This moment is special, we don't need to talk. Let's let it play.'\"\n\nOhlmeyer says that despite a career in sports broadcasting that has involved three Olympic Games telecasts, 16 Emmy Awards and gotten him into the Sports Broadcasting Hall of Fame, the Announcerless Game is the one he will be most remembered for. \"All the stuff I've done in my career, and that's what I'm going to be remembered for,\" he said three decades later. \"It serves me right.\"\n\nNo other United States broadcaster has ever purposely replicated the experiment, with football or any of the other major team professional sports; the networks have produced announcerless broadcasts but only as an alternate feed (with the main network always carrying announcers). ESPN has regularly included announcerless broadcasts as part of its Full Circle and Megacast multi-channel broadcasts, usually on ESPN Classic. In select versions of the MLB.tv app, a 'ballpark sound' option is available on most games with only natural ballpark audio. In 2013, Fox Sports Detroit Plus offered its viewers a \"Natural Sounds at Comerica Park\" channel in which they could watch occasional Tigers baseball games with just the ambient sound from games at the team's home stadium, with information about the game coming via increased graphics as it did in the Announcerless Game. It was, however, offered only on a premier channel for those who paid the highest rates; the regular channel included the team's announcing duo of Mario Impemba and Rod Allen.\n\nThere has been one other instance in which a major league in North America used announcerless broadcasts. In 2005, when the Canadian Media Guild went on strike, CBC Television continued to carry its Canadian Football League broadcasts announcerless rather than bring in replacements. The strike ran from August 20 to October 4.\n\nSince the Announcerless Game, the closest any sports or any other entertainment organization has intentionally gone without announcers have been in professional wrestling. WWE has on occasions gone without announcers mostly for storyline purposes whether it be the announcers being attacked by wrestlers or (kayfabe) quitting. On one occasion, the September 10th, 2012 episode of \"WWE Raw\", WWE unexpectedly went the last hour of the broadcast without any commentary after color commentator Jerry Lawler suffered a (legitimate) heart attack live on-air, with no commentary the rest of the night except for play-by-play man Michael Cole to provide updates on Lawler before and after each commercial break and at the end of \"Raw\".\n\nIra Boudway observed in \"Bloomberg Business\": The problem is that cutting the feed from the booth also means cutting down egos and cutting into advertising reach. If you're not hearing Tim McCarver recite the lyrics to Metallica's 'Enter Sandman', then you're not hearing Joe Buck tell you which beer brand is bringing you the game ... Going announcerless is akin to skipping commercials, and broadcasters and carriers are going to want to find a way to replace the lost revenue.\n\n"}

It runs an annual festival, and manages a multidisciplinary media arts R&D facility known as the Futurelab. It also confers the Prix Ars Electronica awards.\n\nArs Electronica began with its first festival in September 1979. Its founders were Hannes Leopoldseder, Hubert Bognermayr, Herbert W. Franke, and Ulrich Rützel. The festival was held biennially at first, and annually since 1986. The Prix Ars Electronica was inaugurated in 1987 and has been awarded every year since then. Ars Electronica Linz GmbH was incorporated as a limited company in 1995. The Ars Electronica Center, together with the Futurelab, opened in 1996, and was remodelled in 2009.\n\nFunding is provided by the City of Linz, the Province of Upper Austria and the Republic of Austria, in addition to private partners. In 2014 the organization is headed by artistic director Gerfried Stocker and financial director Diethard Schwarzmair.\n\nThe annual Ars Electronica festival is a gathering of artists, scientists and technologists, intended as \"a setting for experimentation, evaluation and reinvention\". The festival has always exerted a public presence in Linz, mounting large-scale open-air projects and holding lectures, discussions and workshops in a wide range of public venues.\n\nEach year the festival is devoted to a specific theme. The festival in 2014, from 4–8 September, had as its theme \"C... What it Takes to Change\", i.e. ways in which social change and innovation can be promoted. It attracted 579 participants and about 85,000 visitors.\n\nA form of concept art, Device Art has been described as \"...a rebellion of form, taking everyday objects and inverting them to tell you something different\". Among the examples exhibited at the 2014 festival were:\n\nA display called \"Smart atoms: spaxels version\" was developed by Ars Electronica Futurelab and shown at the 2014 festival. The \"space pixels\" – automatically controlled drones fitted with LEDs - fly in formation to create apparent three-dimensional objects against the night sky.\n\nThe Prix Ars Electronica is an annual award made in several categories, \"honoring creativity and innovativeness in the use of digital media\". Award winners are selected by a five-person international expert jury, who may themselves propose candidates. The prize may be awarded to individuals or to teams or organizations, and may be awarded for a specific work of art or for another form of innovation. Grover (2008) has described the top-ranking award, the Golden Nica, as \"the Oscar of digital art\".\n\nThe Prix was first awarded in 1987, and there have been several changes in the categories since then. In 2014 there were 2,703 entries from 77 countries. All entries remain on display in an online archive, the Prix Ars Electronica Showcase, containing over 55,000 items.\n\nAwards of the \"Golden Nica\" (worth 10,000 euros), \"Awards of Distinction\", and \"Honorary Mentions\" are made in the following categories:\nNote: \n\nThere is also a grant scheme to honor and support ideas of exceptional promise. It is known as \"[the next idea] voestalpine Art and Technology Grant\".\n\n\nThe Center, also known as the \"Museum of the Future\", is housed in a modern complex of buildings by the Danube. It acts as Ars Electronica’s permanent base and showcase. The majority of the space is used for public exhibitions and events, with an emphasis on interactivity and participation. Major themes are life sciences, environmental issues, and preparation for impending technological developments with likely impacts on society.\n\nThere is also provision for conferences, workshops, and R&D. The Center was enhanced and expanded in 2009, coincident with Linz’s term as European Capital of Culture. It is the most-visited museum in Linz.\n\nThe Futurelab, housed at the Ars Electronica Center, is a center of expertise for multidisciplinary research and development of new cyberarts technologies. It is staffed by about 25 permanent team members, and offers residencies to established and emerging artists and researchers.\n\nThe Futurelab has produced infrastructure and content for the Center and Festival. More recently it has engaged in joint ventures with universities and the private sector.\n\nThe winner of [the next idea] voestalpine Art and Technology Grant is entitled to a term as Artist/Scientist-in-Residence at the Futurelab.\n\nTrent Nathaniel Grover has included an Appendix about Ars Electronica in his book \"Dream of the Techno-Shaman\" (2008). He describes the institute’s activities as “a unique platform for exploring, discussing, tracking, and analyzing the interrelation between art, technology, and society”. Such work, he argues, affirms the place of the human being at the center of techno-cultural processes, as “beneficiaries, victims, and, above all, creators and appliers of new technology”. Noting that the rapid pace of technological innovation has profound implications for culture and society, he presents the role of Ars Electronica as working to integrate developments in technology with art and society to the benefit of all, and contrasts this perspective with the Modernist call for \"art for art’s sake\".\n\nGrover concludes by hoping that Ars Electronica \"will be able to maintain its ongoing quest for innovation and expansion so that we can all benefit from and further involve ourselves in the integration of art, technology, and society\".\n\nGrover (2008) has described the published work of Ars Electronica as \"a compelling snapshot of codependent technological and artistic development with expansive and lasting social and cultural impact.\"\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "8480363", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8480363", "title": "Britannia Theatre", "text": "Britannia Theatre\n\nThe Britannia Theatre (1841–1900) was located at 115/117 High Street, Hoxton, London. The theatre was badly damaged by a fire in 1900. The site was reused as a Gaumont cinema from 1913 to 1940, when this too was destroyed. The site is marked by a London Borough of Hackney historic plaque.\n\nA typical night's entertainment would include 3–4 plays, with variety acts in the intervals between. Many music hall acts would appear during the interval, and sometimes their acts were woven into the performance. The plays varied, from Shakespeare, Victorian melodrama and comedy. During the winter season pantomime was performed.\n\nUnusually for a theatre, food and drink were served in the auditorium, in the style of contemporary music halls.\n\nSamuel Haycraft Lane was born in Lympstone, Devon in 1803. In 1821, he decided to escape the life of a fisherman and walk to London. After living hand to mouth and educating himself, with the help of a friend, William Brian, he encountered a troupe of actors who he had previously met on his journey. He helped the leader of the troupe, Jack Adams, to find premises for performance at the Union Tavern in Shoreditch. This hall catered for 500–seated and a similar number standing. Jack Adam's company performed a successful programme of drama, song, dance and acrobatics. Sam married Jack's daughter Mary, in 1835.\n\nThe troupe always had ambitions to perform serious drama, and in 1839, the company performed \"Othello\", breaking the law on theatrical performance, as they were not a patent theatre. Lane lost his licence and paid a substantial fine. With the increase in London's population, and the increasing popularity of live entertainment, the law was finally changed with the Theatres Act 1843.\n\nIn 1840, Lane and his colleagues thought they had identified a loophole whereby performances could be offered without charge, with profits made from the sale of programmes, food and drink. The Britannia Tavern in Hoxton was identified as suitable premises. This was the former \"Pimlico\" tea gardens, an Elizabethan tavern and had a large hall attached, holding about 1,000 people. The \"Royal Britannia Saloon and Brittania Tavern\" was opened on Easter Monday 1841 by Sam Lane. The theatre was a success. Sadly, private life was more difficult, Mary became pregnant, and slipped and fell at a rehearsal, both she and the baby died. By 1858 having purchased the leases of surrounding properties, the theatre was rebuilt in larger form, with 3,000 seats. This building designed by Finch Hill, consisting of two circles, a pit and a gallery and had a reported record attendance of 4,790.\n\nThe Britannia was notable for melodramas. These included \"The String of Pearls\" (1847), the first stage adaptation of the story of Sweeney Todd, written specifically for this venue by George Dibdin Pitt. The theatre had a resident dramatist, C.H. Hazlewood, who wrote many melodramatic spectacles for it, often based on successful novels of the time, including an adaptation of \"Lady Audley's Secret\" (1863).\n\nCharles Dickens was a frequent visitor to the theatre, and noted in the \"Uncommercial Traveller\" (1861):\n\nMagnificently lighted by a firmament of sparkling chandeliers, the building was ventilated to perfection. [...] The air of this theatre was fresh, cool, and wholesome. [...] It has been constructed from the ground to the roof, with a careful reference to sight and sound in every corner; the result is, that its form is beautiful, and that the appearance of the audience, as seen from the proscenium -- with every face in it commanding the stage, and the whole so admirably raked and turned to that centre, that a hand can scarcely move in the great assemblage without the movement being seen from thence -- is highly remarkable in its union of vastness with compactness. The stage itself, and all its appurtenances of machinery, cellarage, height, and breadth, are on a scale more like the Scala at Milan. or the San Carlo at Naples, or the Grand Opera at Paris, than any notion a stranger would be likely to form of the Britannia Theatre at Hoxton, a mile north of St Luke’s Hospital in the Old-street-road, London. The Forty Thieves might be played here, and every thief ride his real horse, and the disguised captain bring in his oil jars on a train of real camels, and nobody be put out of the way. This really extraordinary place is an achievement of one man’s enterprise, and was erected on the ruins of an inconvenient old building, in less than five months, at a round cost of five-and-twenty thousand pounds.\n\nSam married Sarah Borrow (1822–1899) in 1843. She was the daughter of an old friend, William Borrow, who Lane had appointed to a managerial position in the Britannia. Sarah had begun her own career on the stage, at the age of 17, as a singer and dancer, under the stage name \"Miss Sarah Wilton\". On Lane's death in 1871, Sarah, succeeded him as proprietor and manager, and continued until her own death in August 1899. She appeared regularly as principal boy, in the Britannia's annual pantomimes and in the annual benefit night, appearing in a final tableaux as \"The Queen of Hoxton\". Sarah Lane made her last stage appearance at the Britannia's 1898 Christmas show, aged 76. \"Sallie\" was a well-respected and charitable member of the local community. Large crowds lined the route of her funeral procession from the theatre to Kensal Green Cemetery. Her estate was valued at a quarter of a million pounds, a significant sum in 1889.\n\nA review of \"King Doo-Dah\", the Christmas pantomime, 1900, at the Britannia Theatre, appeared in the \"News of the World\":\n\nThe Lupinos were a theatrical family who often claimed that their scion arrived in England in 1620, as a penniless refugee. George William Lupino was a puppeteer and the family continued to earn a theatrical living becoming associated with the harlequinade at Drury Lane. George Lupino Hook (1820–1902) adopted the stage name Lupino from performing with the family and was associated with the Britannia, performing in leading roles and taking the role of Harlequin in pantomime. A prolific man, reputed to have had 16 children, many became singers, dancers and actors, receiving their first experience in the company. The eldest son, civil registration as George Emanuel Samuel Hook (1853–1932) became both a clown and a prominent actor, amongst his grandchildren was the Hollywood actress Ida Lupino. Lupino Lane was the son of Harry Charles Lupino (1825–1925), a favourite of Sarah Lane and pursued a career in films and musical theatre. Lupino Lane originated \"The Lambeth Walk\", in the \n1937 musical \"Me and My Girl\"'.\n\nSoon after the 1900 pantomime, a serious fire damaged the building. The cost of bringing the building up to standard, forced the sale of the lease. It came into the hands of the Gaumont organisation, and became a cinema in 1913. The original theatre was demolished to make way for a modern cinema which was never built because of the war. In 1940 the nearby Toy Theatre [Pollock's Toy Museum], was destroyed in World War II by German bombing but the theatre building had already gone by this time.\n\nThe Britannia Theatre was unique amongst theatres of the time, for a number of reasons. Entry to the entertainment was always cheap, the income was made from sales of food and drink. There was an extraordinary continuity of management, the theatre was in the hands of the same family throughout its lifetime. The theatre also nurtured talent, many of the regular artistes were taken on at an early stage in their careers and remained with the theatre until retirement. The theatre prospered with the increasing free time and prosperity of its audience, and declined with the introduction of the cinema and later, radio.\n\nAuthor and critic Compton Mackenzie summed up the enduring legacy of the Britannia, in \"Echoes\" (1954):\n\nThe Britannia Theatre was the subject of a novel called \"Sam and Sallie: A novel of the theatre\" (1933) by Alfred L. Crauford. The Crauford's had a long association with the Britannia, and Alfred was one of Sarah Lane's many nephews.\n\nIn Sarah Waters novel, Tipping the Velvet, her lead characters are engaged to play pantomime in the theatre.\n\nMentioned in the (Cockney style singers) Chas and Dave's song `Harry was a Champion' (`down at the old Britania')\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2960562", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2960562", "title": "Chase Vault", "text": "Chase Vault\n\nThe Chase Vault is a burial vault in the cemetery of the Christ Church Parish Church in Oistins, Christ Church, Barbados, best known for a widespread legend of \"mysterious moving coffins\". According to the story, each time the heavily sealed vault was opened in the early 19th century for burial of a family member, all of the lead coffins had changed position. The facts of the story are unverified, and skeptics call the tale \"historically dubious\".\n\nThe first published version of the story appeared in 1833 in James Edward Alexander's \"Transatlantic Sketches\". According to Alexander, a Mrs. Goddard was buried in the vault in 1807, followed in 1808 by Ann Maria Chase, and in 1812 by Dorcas Chase. When the vault was opened in late 1812 for the burial of Thomas Chase, the caskets of the Chase girls were said to be found \"in a confused state, having been apparently tossed from their places.\" Alexander wrote that when the vault was later opened \"to receive the body of another infant, the four coffins, all of lead, all very heavy, were much disturbed\" and that similar disturbances were found when opening the vault for burials in 1816 and 1819:\n\nDifferent versions of the story appeared over the years, with other accounts published in 1844 and 1860.\n\nAccording to author Jerome Clark, the story of the Chase Vault appears to originate from anecdotes told by Thomas H. Orderson, Rector of Christ Church during the 1800s. Orderson gave \"conflicting accounts\" of the tale, each containing variations. Clark says the story was subsequently repeated in Alexander's 1833 \"Transatlantic Sketches,\" and further repeated the same year in the \"Anecdote Gallery\" section of Reuben Percy's \"The Mirror of Literature, Amusement, and Instruction.\"\n\nClark says that most stories that proliferated about the Chase Vault referred back to sources that could be traced to one of Orderson's accounts, and that folklorist Andrew Lang identified the differing versions told by Orderson in a December 1907 article published in \"Folk-Lore Journal\". After combing through existing documentation to determine the veracity of the Chase Vault stories, Lang reported that he could find nothing to substantiate them, either in the burial register of Christ Church or in contemporary newspapers on Barbados, aside from an \"unpublished firsthand account\" by a Nathan Lucas, who claimed to be present at the opening of the vault in April 1820.\n\nSkeptical investigator Joe Nickell said that stories about the Chase Vault were often repeated, but he called them \"historically dubious.\" Nickell, who had investigated an earlier alleged Masonic hoax involving a tale of buried treasure at Oak Island, contended that the Barbados story was fashioned around the Masonic allegory of a \"secret vault\" which, according to a Masonic text, \"was ... in the ancient mysteries, symbolic of death, where alone Divine Truth is to be found.\" Nickell wrote that two of the men named in the Chase Vault story were members of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, and that a similar tale of \"restless coffins\" was circulated in 1943 that specifically included a party of Freemasons and a vault containing the founder of Freemasonry in Barbados. Nickell noted that Chase Vault stories were loaded with symbols and phrases which Freemasons would have recognized.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "25498357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=25498357", "title": "Diary", "text": "Diary\n\nA diary is a record (originally in handwritten format) with discrete entries arranged by date reporting on what has happened over the course of a day or other period. A personal diary may include a person's experiences, thoughts, and/or feelings, excluding comments on current events outside the writer's direct experience. Someone who keeps a diary is known as a diarist. Diaries undertaken for institutional purposes play a role in many aspects of human civilization, including government records (e.g. \"Hansard\"), business ledgers, and military records. In British English, the word may also denote a preprinted journal format.\n\nToday the term is generally employed for personal diaries, normally intended to remain private or to have a limited circulation amongst friends or relatives. The word \"journal\" may be sometimes used for \"diary,\" but generally a diary has (or intends to have) daily entries, whereas journal-writing can be less frequent.\n\nAlthough a diary may provide information for a memoir, autobiography or biography, it is generally written not with the intention of being published as it stands, but for the author's own use. In recent years, however, there is internal evidence in some diaries (e.g. those of Ned Rorem, Alan Clark, Tony Benn or Simon Gray) that they are written with eventual publication in mind, with the intention of self-vindication (pre- or posthumous) or simply for profit.\n\nBy extension the term diary is also used to mean a printed publication of a written diary; and may also refer to other terms of journal including electronic formats (e.g. blogs).\n\nThe word \"diary\" comes from the Latin \"diarium\" (\"daily allowance,\" from \"dies\" \"day\"). The word \"journal\" comes from the same root (\"diurnus\" \"of the day\") through Old French \"jurnal\" (modern French for \"day\" is \"jour\").\n\nThe earliest use of the word refers to a book in which a daily record was written was in Ben Jonson's comedy \"Volpone\" in 1605.\n\nThe oldest extant diaries come from Middle Eastern and East Asian cultures, although the even earlier work \"To Myself\" (Τὰ εἰς ἑαυτόν), today known as the \"Meditations\", written in Greek by the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius in the second half of the 2nd century AD, already displays many characteristics of a diary. Pillowbooks of Japanese court ladies and Asian travel journals offer some aspects of this genre of writing, although they rarely consist exclusively of diurnal records. The scholar Li Ao (9th century AD), for example, kept a diary of his journey through southern China.\n\nIn the medieval Near East, Arabic diaries were written from before the 10th century. The earliest surviving diary of this era which most resembles the modern diary was that of Ibn Banna' in the 11th century. His diary is the earliest known to be arranged in order of date (\"ta'rikh\" in Arabic), very much like modern diaries.\n\nThe precursors of the diary in the modern sense include daily notes of medieval mystics, concerned mostly with inward emotions and outward events perceived as spiritually important (e.g. Elizabeth of Schönau, Agnes Blannbekin, and perhaps also, in the lost vernacular account of her visions, Beatrice of Nazareth).\n\nFrom the Renaissance on, some individuals wanted not only to record events, as in medieval chronicles and itineraries, but also to put down their own opinions and express their hopes and fears, without any intention to publish these notes. One of the early preserved examples is the anonymous \"Journal d'un bourgeois de Paris\" that covers the years 1405–49, giving subjective commentaries on the current events. Famous 14th- to 16th-century Renaissance examples, which appeared much later as books, were the diaries by the Florentines Buonaccorso Pitti and Gregorio Dati and the Venetian Marino Sanuto the Younger. Here we find records of even less important everyday occurrences together with much reflection, emotional experience and personal impressions.\n\nIn 1908 the Smythson company created the first featherweight diary, enabling diaries to be carried about.\n\nMany diaries of notable figures have been published and form an important element of autobiographical literature.\n\nSamuel Pepys (1633–1703) is the earliest diarist who is well known today; his diaries, preserved in Magdalene College, Cambridge, were first transcribed and published in 1825. Pepys was amongst the first who took the diary beyond mere business transaction notation, into the realm of the personal. Pepys' contemporary John Evelyn also kept a notable diary, and their works are among the most important primary sources for the English Restoration period, and consist of eyewitness accounts of many great events, such as the Great Plague of London, and the Great Fire of London.\n\nThe practice of posthumous publication of diaries of literary and other notables began in the 19th century. As examples, the \"Grasmere Journal\" of Dorothy Wordsworth (1771–1855) was published in 1897; the Journals of Fanny Burney (1752–1840) were published in 1889; the diaries of Henry Crabb Robinson (1776–1867) were published in 1869.\n\nAmong important U.S. Civil War diaries are those of George Templeton Strong, a New York City lawyer, and Mary Chesnut, the wife of a Confederate officer. The diary of Jemima Condict, living in the area of what is now West Orange, New Jersey, includes local observations of the American Revolutionary War.\n\nSince the 19th century the publication of diaries by their authors has become commonplace – notably amongst politicians seeking justification but also amongst artists and litterateurs of all descriptions. Amongst late 20th-century British published political diaries, those of Richard Crossman, Tony Benn and Alan Clark are representative, the latter being more indiscreet in the tradition of the diaries of Chips Channon. In Britain in the field of the arts notable diaries were published by James Lees-Milne, Roy Strong and Peter Hall.\n\nOne of the most famous modern diaries, widely read and translated, is the posthumously published \"The Diary of a Young Girl\" by Anne Frank, who wrote it while in hiding during the German occupation of Amsterdam in the 1940s. Otto Frank edited his daughter's diary and arranged for its publication after the War. Many edits were made before the diary was published in other countries. This was due to the sexually explicit material, which also led to some libraries banning the book.\n\nThe writing of diaries was also often practiced from the 20th century onwards as a conscious act of self-exploration (of greater or lesser sincerity) – examples being the diaries of Carl Jung, Aleister Crowley and Anaïs Nin. Among important diaries by 20th-century literary figures are those of Franz Kafka, Edmund Wilson and the French writer Paul Léautaud (1872–1956). The self-reflective \"\" written by Saint Faustina contains accounts of her visions and conversations with Jesus.\n\nA strong psychological effect may arise from having an audience for one's self-expression, even if this is the book one writes in, only read by oneself – particularly in adversity. Anne Frank went so far as to address her diary as \"Kitty.\" Friedrich Kellner, a court official in Nazi Germany, thought of his diary as a weapon for any future fight against tyrants and terrorism, and named it \"Mein Widerstand,\" \"My Opposition\". Victor Klemperer was similarly concerned with recording for the future the tyrannies and hypocrisies of Nazi Germany and of its East German successor state in his diaries. In none of these cases, however, did the authors anticipate early – or indeed any – publication.\n\nAs internet access became commonly available, many people adopted it as another medium in which to chronicle their lives with the added dimension of an audience. The first online diary is thought to be Claudio Pinhanez's \"Open Diary,\" published at the MIT Media Lab website from 14 November 1994 until 1996. Other early online diarists include Justin Hall, who began eleven years of personal online diary-writing in 1994, Carolyn Burke, who started publishing \"Carolyn's Diary\" on 3 January 1995, and Bryon Sutherland, who announced his diary \"The Semi-Existence of Bryon\" in a USENET newsgroup on 19 April 1995.\n\nThe internet has also served as a way to bring previously unpublished diaries to the attention of historians and other readers, such as the diary of Michael Shiner, a 19th-century slave who documented his life in Washington, D.C.\n\nWeb-based services such as Open Diary (started in October 1998) and LiveJournal (January 1999) soon appeared to streamline and automate online publishing, but growth in personal storytelling came with the emergence of blogs. While the format first focused on external links and topical commentary, widespread blogging tools were quickly used to create web journals. Recent advances have also been made to enable the privacy of internet diary entries. For example, some diary software now stores entries in an encrypted format, such as 256-bit AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) encryption, and others only permit access to the diary after correct PIN entry on a secure USB device.\n\nWith the popularization of mobile apps, diary or journaling apps have become available for iOS and Android. Proponents cite the following as primary reasons for journaling with digital applications: Ease and speed of typing; mobile portability; search capabilities; entry location, date, and other metadata from mobile phones; and, tags and other organizational features. Digital diaries also seem tailored towards shorter-form, in-the-moment writing, similar to user engagement with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other social media services.\n\nA personal organizer is a form of diary to list actions and tasks for the day are recorded in a log, often using symbols to differentiate and categorize items.\n\nA diet journal or food diary is a daily record of all food and beverage consumed as a means of tracking calorie consumption for the purpose of weight loss or other nutritional monitoring.\n\nA sleep diary or sleep log is a tool used in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders or to keep track of dreams had in order to gain insight to the subconscious or for other further contemplating.\n\nThe German \"Tagebuch\" (\"day-book\") is normally rendered as \"diary\" in English, but the term encompasses workbooks or working journals as well as diaries proper. For example, the notebooks of the Austrian writer Robert Musil and of the German-Swiss artist Paul Klee are called \"Tagebücher\".\n\nA travel journal, travel diary, or road journal, is the documentation of a journey or series of journeys.\n\nA war diary is a regularly updated official record of a military unit's administration and activities during wartime maintained by an officer in the unit.\n\nThere are numerous examples of fictional diaries. One of the earliest printed fictional diaries was the humorous \"Diary of a Nobody\" by George Grossmith and his brother Weedon. 20th-century examples include radio broadcasts (e.g. \"Mrs. Dale's Diary\") and published books (e.g. the \"Diaries of Adrian Mole\"). Both prompted long-running satirical features in the magazine \"Private Eye\": the former entitled \"Mrs Wilson's Diary\" in reference to Mary Wilson, wife of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, the latter entitled \"The Secret Diary of John Major Aged 47¾\" and written as a pastiche of the Adrian Mole diaries from the perspective of the then-Prime Minister John Major. Another famous example of fictional diaries as prose is Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\". A modern example includes the \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\" series where each book of the series is written in a first-person view of the main character, as if the book were an actual diary. Other examples are the \"Bert Diaries\" and the cellphone diaries in the Japanese manga and anime television series \"Future Diary\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "341005", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341005", "title": "Einstein on the Beach", "text": "Einstein on the Beach\n\nEinstein on the Beach is an opera in four acts (framed and connected by five \"knee plays\" or intermezzos), composed by Philip Glass and directed by theatrical producer Robert Wilson. The opera eschews traditional narrative in favor of a formalist approach based on structured spaces laid out by Wilson in a series of storyboards. The music was written \"in the spring, summer and fall of 1975\". Glass recounts the collaborative process: \"I put [Wilson’s notebook of sketches] on the piano and composed each section like a portrait of the drawing before me. The score was begun in the spring of 1975 and completed by the following November, and those drawings were before me all the time.\" The premiere took place on July 25, 1976, at the Avignon Festival in France. The opera contains writings by Christopher Knowles, Samuel M. Johnson and Lucinda Childs. It is Glass's first and longest opera score, taking approximately five hours in full performance without intermission; given the length, the audience is permitted to enter and leave as desired.\n\nThe work became the first in Glass's thematically related Portrait Trilogy, along with \"Satyagraha\" (1979), and \"Akhnaten\" (1983). These three operas were described by Glass as portraits of people whose personal vision transformed the thinking of their times through the power of ideas rather than by military force.\n\nGlass and Wilson first met to discuss the prospects of a collaborative work, and decided on an opera of between four and five hours in length based around a historical persona. Wilson initially suggested Charlie Chaplin or Adolf Hitler, whom Glass outright rejected, while Glass proposed Mahatma Gandhi (later the central figure of his opera \"Satyagraha\"). Albert Einstein was the eventual compromise.\n\n\"Einstein on the Beach\" premiered on July 25, 1976, at the Avignon Festival in France, performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble and presented by the Byrd Hoffmann Foundation. The opera was also staged that summer in Hamburg, Paris, Belgrade, Venice, Brussels and Rotterdam. To realise a staging in New York, Glass and Wilson agreed to rent the Metropolitan Opera House in New York to hold two performances in November 1976. Lucinda Childs, Robert Wilson pupil Sheryl S. Sutton and Samuel M. Johnson filled the primary characters; all three reappeared in the 1984 BAM revival.\n\nThe Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM) next mounted the opera in 1984. A one-hour documentary about this production appeared on public television, titled \"Einstein on the Beach: The Changing Image of Opera\".\n\nIn 1988, opera director Achim Freyer (who had staged the world premiere of Glass's \"Akhnaten\" in Stuttgart, Germany, in 1984) designed and staged a reworked version in a highly abstract style, with new spoken texts from the early 20th century, at the Stuttgart State Opera. As with the premiere, this version was also conducted by Michael Riesman.\n\nIn 1992, a revival was mounted by International Production Associates that included the participation of Wilson, Glass and Childs. The production was re-staged at the McCarter theater at Princeton University. It subsequently toured to Frankfurt, Melbourne, Barcelona, Madrid, Tokyo, Brooklyn (BAM) and Paris.\n\nIn 2001, the opera was staged as an \"opera-installation\" at the former headquarters of the State Bank of the GDR in Berlin. It was conducted by Ari Benjamin Myers, directed by Berthold Schneider, with stage design by Veronika Witte. The performance combined the concepts of opera and installation art, created by various artists for the production. The spectators were encouraged to wander through the exhibition, while the actions of the musicians could be followed on video screens. A different production by the same team, following the same principle, was staged on the Einstein anniversary in 2005 at the Berlin Parochialkirche.\n\nIn 2007, Carnegie Hall presented a concert version of \"Einstein\" in which violinist Tim Fain appeared as soloist. \"The New York Times\" wrote about his performance, \"And Tim Fain, the violinist, gave the solo passages in the second, fourth and fifth 'Knee Plays' and in the climactic, swirling 'Spaceship Interior' scene an electrifying, virtuosic workout.\" Fain tours extensively with Phillip Glass in duo recitals and they always include the solo from \"Knee Play 2\" on their program.\n\nA revival with the participation of all the original collaborators was commissioned by the New York City Opera (NYCO) to open their 2009/2010 season. When General Manager designate Gerard Mortier withdrew from NYCO, the revival, along with the rest of Mortier's programming, was canceled.\n\nThe team that had organized the New York City Opera production put together another group to remount \"Einstein\", under the management of Pomegranate Arts. After a month of rehearsals overseen by Glass, Wilson and Childs, the first performance in 20 years took place on January 20, 2012, presented by the University Musical Society at the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor (two additional performances that weekend followed). The performance featured Kate Moran and Helga Davis replacing Childs' and Sutton's roles respectively. Grammy Award-nominated violinist Jennifer Koh played the role of Einstein in the preview and alternated with Antoine Silverman for the subsequent tour. The other instrumental performers and solfege soprano for these performances are the current members of the Philip Glass Ensemble without Glass himself performing. The performers in the 2012 production included members of the Lucinda Childs Dance Company: Ty Boomershine, Matthew Pardo, Patrick O'Neill, Stuart Singer, Lonnie Poupard, Caitlin Scranton, Sharon Milanese, Katie Dorn, Katherine Helen Fisher, Anne Lewis, Shakirah Stewart, and Sarah Hillmon. The chorus for this revival was composed of sopranos Michèle Eaton, Melanie Russell, Lindsay Kesselman; altos Hai-Ting Chinn, Solange Merdinian, Kate Maroney; tenors John Kawa, Philip Anderson, Tomas Cruz; and basses Greg Purnhagen, Joe Damon Chappel, and Jason Charles Walker.\n\nThe official tour began on March 16, 2012, (after a single preview the previous evening) with the premiere at the Opéra Berlioz in Montpellier, France. This was followed by performances at the Teatro Valli in Reggio Emilia, Italy; the Barbican Centre, London; the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts, Toronto; the Brooklyn Academy of Music Brooklyn, New York; Zellerbach Hall at the University of California, Berkeley, California; the Teatro del Palacio de Bellas Artes, Mexico City: in 2013, at Het Muziektheater/De Nederlandse Opera, Amsterdam; Hong Kong; Arts Centre Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia; Los Angeles Opera, Los Angeles: and, in 2014 there were performances in Paris and Berlin. In October 2015 this production came to an end with performances in Gwangju, South Korea.\n\nThis touring production of \"Einstein on the Beach\" was commissioned by: BAM; the Barbican, London; Cal Performances with the University of California, Berkeley; Luminato – Toronto Festival of Arts and Creativity; De Nederlandse Opera/The Amsterdam Music Theatre; Opéra national de Montpellier Languedoc-Roussillon; and the University Musical Society of the University of Michigan.\n\nCarolina Crown's 2013 Drum Corps International Championship production \"E=mc^2\" included selections of the opera.\n\nCulturebox, a digital production dedicated to cultural content for French Television, streamed a live performance from Théâtre du Châtelet on January 7, 2014, and made it available as streaming video for the next six months only. This was the first time the opera was filmed.\n\nAlso, a new staging of \"Einstein on the Beach\" will premiere at the Opernhaus Dortmund, Germany, in April 2017. It is directed by Kay Voges and is supposed to be the first production of \"Einstein on the Beach\" without Glass or Wilson personally involved.\n\nFrom the beginning of Glass and Wilson's collaboration, they insisted on portraying the icon purely as a historical figure, in the absence of a storyline attached to his image. While they did incorporate symbols from Einstein's life within the opera's scenery, characters, and music, they intentionally chose not to give the opera a specific plot. This is in accord with Wilson's formalist approach, which he asserts creates more truth on stage than naturalist theater. Wilson structured \"Einstein on the Beach\" as a repeating sequence of three different kinds of space. Between major acts are shorter entr'actes known as \"knee plays,\" a signature technique that Wilson has applied throughout his oeuvre. Propelling idea of \"non-plot\" within \"Einstein on the Beach\", its libretto employs solfège syllables, numbers, and short sections of poetry. In an interview, Glass comments that he originally intended for his audience to construct personal connections with Einstein as a character and with the music that he assigns to the icon. For example, the music within the first of the opera's \"Knee Plays\" features repeated numbers accompanied by an electric organ. Glass states that these numbers and solfège syllables were used as placeholders for texts by the singers to memorize their parts, and were kept instead of replacing them with texts. This numerical repetition, however, offers an interpretation as a reference to the mathematical and scientific breakthroughs made by Einstein himself. Of further reference to the icon's image, everything on the originally staged set of \"Einstein on the Beach\", from costumes to lighting, depicts specific aspects that refer to Einstein's life.\n\nOverall, the music assigned to \"Einstein\" demonstrates a circular process, a repeating cycle that constantly delays resolution. This process uses both additive and subtractive formulas. The three main scenes within the opera—\"Train\", \"Trial\", and \"Field/Spaceship\"—allude to Einstein's hypotheses about his theory of relativity and his unified field theory. Specifically, themes within the opera allude to nuclear weapons, science, and AM radio.\n\nThe opera consists of nine connected 20-minute scenes in four acts separated by \"Knee Plays\". Five \"Knee Plays\" frame the opera's structure and appear in between acts, while also functioning as the opening and closing scenes. Glass defines a \"Knee Play\" as an interlude between acts and as \"the 'knee' referring to the joining function that humans' anatomical knees perform\". While the \"Knee Plays\" helped to create the necessary time to change the scenery of Wilson's seven sets, these interludes also served a musical function. David Cunningham, a Glass scholar, writes that the intermittence of Glass's \"Knee Plays\" amongst the opera's four acts, serves as a \"constant motif in the whole work\".\n\nThe opera requires a cast of two female, one male, and one male child in speaking roles (for the Wilson production); a 16-person SATB chamber chorus with an outstanding soprano soloist and a smaller tenor solo part; three reed players: flute (doubling piccolo and bass clarinet), soprano saxophone (doubling flute), tenor saxophone (doubling alto saxophone); solo violin, and two synthesizers/electronic organs. The orchestration was originally tailored to the five members of the Philip Glass Ensemble, plus the solo violin.\n\nThe work is structured as follows:\n\n\n\"I Feel the Earth Move\" is the third section in the Trial 2/Prison section of the opera. The section is written in the same style as the rest of the opera, but has an instrumentation of soprano saxophone and bass clarinet, omitting the electronic keyboard used in most of the segments in \"Einstein on the Beach\". A poem by Christopher Knowles is read over the musical soprano saxophone and bass clarinet line and in the poem's meanderings, it mentions such \"TV personalities\" as David Cassidy. A shortened version of this piece was chosen along with three other selections from \"Einstein on the Beach\" to appear on another Philip Glass album \"Songs from the Trilogy\", which also included selections from Glass's operas \"Satyagraha\" and \"Akhnaten\". The section's title is a reference to a Carole King song of the same name, from her album \"Tapestry\".\n\nTwo \"complete\" recordings of the opera have been made: the first in 1978, initially released on the Tomato label (TOM-4-2901) in 1979, and later reissued by CBS Masterworks, followed by Sony Classical (both M4K 38875); the second in 1993, released that same year on the Nonesuch label (79323). The 1978 recording was held to 165 minutes in order to fit onto four LP records, i.e., the opening scene's repeats were considerably shortened. The 1993 recording encompassed 200 minutes, freed by the technology of the compact disc, although it was released on \"three\" CDs instead of the original's four.\n\nMichael Riesman conducted both recordings. In 1978, Lucinda Childs, Sheryl Sutton, Paul Mann, and Samuel M. Johnson performed the opera's texts, with Philip Glass Ensemble performer Iris Hiskey taking the soprano solo. In 1993 Childs and Sutton repeated their roles, while Gregory Dolbashian and Jasper McGruder replaced Mann and the late Mr. Johnson's roles respectively, and Jeremy Montemarano voiced the role of \"The Boy;\" Schuman sang the soprano role. Most of the participants in the Nonesuch recording had performed in \"Einstein on the Beach\" during its 1992 world tour. A 77-minute highlights CD from the 1984 Brooklyn Academy of Music performances, accompanied by a DVD documentary, was released by Philip Glass's personal label Orange Mountain Music in early September 2012, and an extended recording, 217 minutes long, was released at the same time but available only by download from the iTunes Store. In October 2013, Pacifica Radio released a two disc set of a 1976 interview with Glass and Wilson conducted at The Kitchen and excerpts from a rehearsal of some excerpts from the opera, also performed at The Kitchen on March 19, 1976.\n\nThe violin part for the work has been performed by Robert Brown (in the live 1976 production), Paul Zukofsky (in the 1979 recording), Tison Street (in the live 1984 production), Gregory Fulkerson (in the live 1992 production and 1993 recording) and an interchanging performance of Jennifer Koh and Antoine Silverman during the 2012/16 production.\n\nAnton Batagov recorded 3 transcription pieces (Scene 2 - Trail 1 from Act 1, Scene 2 - Night Train from Act 2 and Knee Play 5) from this work on solo piano in his album \"PROPHECIES\" (2016, on Orange Mountain Music label).\n\nA 270min recording from January 2014 at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris was released on DVD and Blu-ray in October 2016.\n\nExcerpts were used as background music for several shots in season 3, episode 5 of the \"Mr. Robot\" television series.\n\n"}
{"id": "21960928", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21960928", "title": "Festival book", "text": "Festival book\n\nFestival books (, ) are books, often illustrated, that commemorate a notable event such as a royal entry, coronation or wedding. Funerals were also commemorated in similar fashion. The genre thrived in Renaissance and early modern Europe, where rulers utilized the form to both document and embellish displays of wealth and power.\nLarge numbers were produced, often surviving in very few copies; the largest collection, in the British Library, has over 2000 examples. Originally manuscripts, often illustrated, compiled for prince or city, with the arrival of print they were frequently published, varying in form from short pamphlets describing the order of events, and perhaps recording speeches, to lavish books illustrated with woodcuts or engravings showing the various tableaux, often including a fold-out panorama of the procession, curling to and fro across the page. The pamphlets were ephemera; a printed description of two leaves describing the entry of Ferdinand II of Aragon into Valladolid, 1513, survives in a single copy (at Harvard) because it was bound with another text. A lost description of the ceremonious reception given by Louis XII to Ferdinand at Savona (June 1507) is only known from a purchase receipt of Ferdinand Columbus.\n\nThese \"livrets\" are not always to be trusted as literal records; some were compiled beforehand from the plans, and others after the event from fading memories. The authors or artists engaged in producing the books had by no means always seen the entry themselves. Roy Strong finds that they are \"an idealization of an event, often quite distant from its reality as experienced by the average onlooker. One of the objects of such publications was to reinforce by means of word and image the central ideas that motivated those who conceived the programme.\" Philip II of Spain's ceremonial entry into Antwerp in 1549 was all but called off because of torrential rain, but the book shows it as it should have been. Thomas Dekker, the playwright and author of the book on \"The Magnificent Entertainment\" for James I of England is refreshingly frank:\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian I, went a step further, creating enormous virtual triumphs that existed solely in the form of print. The \"Triumphs of Maximilian\" (begun in 1512 and unfinished at Maximilian's death in 1519) contains over 130 large woodcuts by Albrecht Dürer and other artists, showing a huge procession (still in open country) culminating in the Emperor himself, mounted on a huge car. \"The Triumphal Arch\" (1515), the largest print ever made, at 3.57 x 2.95 metres when the 192 sheets are assembled, was produced in an edition of seven hundred copies for distribution to friendly cities and princes. It was intended to be hand-coloured and then pasted to a wall. Traditional tableau themes, including a large genealogy, and many figures of Virtues, are complemented by scenes of Maximilian's life and military victories. Maximilian was wary of entries in person, having been locked up by his loyal subjects in Bruges in 1488 for eleven weeks, until he could pay the bills from his stay.\n\nAn early meeting between the festival book with travel literature is the account of the visit in 1530 of the future Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, then King of Hungary and Bohemia, to Constantinople.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6910706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6910706", "title": "International Holocaust Cartoon Competition", "text": "International Holocaust Cartoon Competition\n\nInternational Holocaust Cartoon Contest was a cartoon competition sponsored by the Iranian newspaper \"Hamshahri\", to denounce what it called \"Western hypocrisy on freedom of speech\". The event was staged in response to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. Several public figures, including the United States State Department, the Israeli Foreign Ministry, and United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan criticized the contest.\n\nIn January 2015, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shooting and the magazines subsequent decision to publish further cartoons of Muhammad, the Iranian House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex in Iran announced that they would be sponsoring \"The 2nd International Holocaust Cartoons Contest\". Selected cartoons were exhibited in the Islamic Propaganda Organization starting on May 14, 2016.\n\nOn February 6, 2006, Farid Mortazavi, graphics editor of \"Hamshahri\", announced a competition for cartoons on the Holocaust. The twelve best contributions were to be rewarded with a gold coin each, which were later increased to $5,000 to $12,000 prizes for the top 3 cartoons and 3 gold coins each for 12 other cartoonists. Later, \"Hamshahri\" published an English introduction to the contest, as well as preliminary rules.\n\nThe contest was created in response to the twelve cartoons published by the Danish newspaper \"Jyllands-Posten\" (see \"Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy\") to challenge the championing of freedom of speech in the defense of the \"Jyllands-Posten\" cartoons. This was done under the notion that those who supported the \"Jyllands-Posten\"'s right to free anti-Islamic speech would be placed in a precarious position were they to condemn the antisemitic cartoons targeted at one of the most sensitive of Jewish topics. In that introductory message for the contest, \"Hamshahri\" denounced what they called Western hypocrisy on freedom of speech, alleging that \"it is impossible in the West to joke upon or even discuss certain topics related to Judaism, such as the Holocaust, and the pretexts for the creation of Israel.\"\n\nOn February 14, 2006, the editor in chief of \"Hamshahri\" commented in Persian that \"the purpose of establishing such a competition is not to offend or ridicule anyone, but to do a discussion about the realities of the Holocaust.\" He also indicated that \"Hamshahri\" tries really hard not to cause pain for anyone and also added that the newspaper has no contention with the Jews in Iran or any other place, but that it has problems with Zionism. Masood Shojaei, the director of Iran's Caricature House which cosponsored the competition also said: \"Iran's Caricature House, as the only technically qualified center involved in the competition regards the Holocaust topic as a terrible and saddening issue\". The exhibition put on by The Iran Cartoon Organisation and \"Hamshahri\" newspaper opened on August 14, 2006.\n\nAfter the winners were announced in November 2006, Shojaei said the competition would become an annual event. The Associated Press quoted him as saying \"Actually, we will continue until the destruction of Israel\". However, Shojaei categorically denies that he even spoke to the Associated Press reporter.\n\nConservative newspapers such as \"Kayhan\" and \"Jomhouri Eslami\" have hailed the decision by \"Hamshahri\" for the contest, and their cartoonists, such as Maziyar Bizhani have actively entered the competition.\n\nSeveral reformers criticized the cartoon competition and also the president's statements about the Holocaust. Emadoddin Baghi, a famous member of religious-intellectuals circle, Ebrahim Yazdi, the head of Nehzat Azadi Party, Hamid Reza Jalaeipour, a prominent figure of Islamic Iran Participation Front and Sadeq Zibakalam, a prominent political analyst of the Kargozaran party criticized these new policies by calling them \"useless, scientifically-baseless and purely political actions which originates from the authorities' lack of historical knowledge\". In an interview with BBC, Nikahang Kowsar, a former cartoonist for \"Hamshahri\", said he thought the competition was the wrong approach. \"It's a bad reaction to a bad action coming from the Danish newspaper\", he told the BBC. He also claimed in his weblog that, \"Hamshahri\" cartoonists will have a bad fate if they refuse to take part in the competition.\n\nIsraeli artists spoofed the contest by the Israeli antisemitic cartoons contest.\n\nOn February 8, 2006 Flemming Rose (the cultural editor for \"Jyllands-Posten\"), told CNN: \"My newspaper is trying to establish a contact with that Iranian newspaper \"Hamshahri\", and we would run the cartoons the same day as they publish them\". Later that day, the paper's editor-in-chief said that \"Jyllands-posten\" would under no circumstances publish the Holocaust cartoons.\n\nOn February 14, the \"Hamshahri\" website suffered a denial-of-service attack. Simultaneously, the websites of Iran's ministry of education and two major Iranian banks, Sepah Bank and Refah Bank, became inaccessible, as they were all hosted by the same backbone.\n\nSix of the least controversial cartoons of the International Holocaust Cartoon Competition were republished by Danish Newspaper \"Dagbladet Information\" on September 8, 2006 after the editor consulted the main rabbi in Copenhagen, and three cartoons were later reprinted in \"Jyllands-Posten\" as well.\n\nThe event was also criticised by the then United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the U.S. State Department, the Israeli foreign ministry, Reporters Without Borders, the Anti-Defamation League and other parties.\n\nOn November 1, 2006, political cartoonist Abdellah Derkaoui (), a Moroccan, was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. Derkaoui's winning cartoon differed from many of the runners-up, in that it did not deny the Holocaust; instead, it used the Holocaust to make a comparison between the actions of Nazi Germany and the current actions of the Israeli government.\n\nThe second prize of US$8,000 was split to Brazilian cartoonist Carlos Latuff and far-right cartoonist Chard, from France, although Chard refused the prize, stating that her cartoon was entered into the competition without her consent. According to the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, the cartoon by Chard contains explicit Holocaust denial.\n\nShahram Rezai of Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. In addition to the main prizes, there were also 'Special Prizes' awarded to several entries, in which each was awarded with three gold coins. One of these prizes went to Italy, one prize to Morocco, two to Jordan, one to Syria, two to Brazil, and five went to Iranians.\n\nIn December 2015, two state-sponsored Iranian cultural organizations, the Owj Media & Art Institute and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex, announced a Holocaust cartoon contest. Over 150 cartoons from the contest made up a May 2016 exhibition in the art section at the Islamic Propaganda Organization in Tehran, as part of Iran's Cartoon Biennial. After the closing of the Tehran exhibition at the end of May 2016, the Islamic Propaganda Organization sponsored exhibitions of selected cartoons in provincial capitals throughout the country.\n\nIn an April 2016 interview published in the \"New Yorker\", Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tried to distance the Iranian government from the contest, asserting that it did not receive government support or endorsement, and that no official permission was necessary to hold it. Following Zarif's statement, a spokesperson from the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance questioned the Foreign Minister's comments, stating that the Ministry supports any program that will \"enlighten people about the Holocaust\". The main spokesperson for the contest, Mas`oud Shoja'i Tabataba'i, said that Zarif was not welcome at the exhibition. Zarif was questioned in the Iranian parliament about his negative position on the Holocaust cartoon contest and exhibition three months after its closing. He maintained his belief that Holocaust denial does not benefit the Islamic Republic of Iran and he repeated the claim that the contest was the work of an NGO and not any government agency.\n\nAmerican political cartoonist Daryl Cagle entered a cartoon into the Second Holocaust Cartoon Competition in 2015. The cartoon features Iran's Supreme Leader with his face in the shape of a pair of human buttocks: the face / posterior is farting out the words to his famous statement, \"The Holocaust is an event whose reality is uncertain and if it has happened, it's uncertain how it happened.\"\n\n\"I'm guessing the Iranians will not choose to include my cartoon in their exhibition and competition – but considering how the contest organizers complain about the \"West\" censoring \"discussion\" of the Holocaust, I thought it was a nice irony to give them a Holocaust cartoon that they would likely censor,\" writes Cagle.\n\nIrina Bokova, Director-General of UNESCO condemned the holding of it: \"Such an initiative which aims at a mockery of the genocide of the Jewish people, a tragic page of humanity's history, can only foster hatred and incite to violence, racism and anger. This contest goes against the universal values of tolerance and respect, and runs counter to the action led by UNESCO to promote Holocaust education, to fight amti-Semitism and denial.\" \n\nOn May 31, 2016, French cartoonist Zeon was announced as the winner and received the first prize of US$12,000. The cartoonist was arrested by the French authorities back in March 2015 for his anti-Semitic work that he drew back in 2011. His winning work features what appears to be the entry gate of a Nazi-era death camp atop a cash register with six million in cash inside.\n\nIndonesian artist Jitet Koestana won the second prize of US$7,000 while Mahmud Nazari from Iran won the third prize of US$5,000. In addition to the main prizes similar to the 2006 contest, there were also 'Special Prizes' awarded to several entries, in which each was awarded with three gold coins. One of these prizes went to Belgium, Morocco, Turkey and several other countries.\n\nThe Belgian winner, Luc Descheemaeker using the name O-sekoer, is a schoolteacher in a Catholic school in the Flemish city of Torhout. The school and the city felt very honored that he won a price at that contest. Even the Flemish press took his defense towards Jewish organisations condemning the contest. The mayor of the city is the Flemish minister of education, Hilde Crevits who refused to condemn the cartoon. Descheemaeker was consequently nominated cultural ambassador of the city of Torhout. Meanwhile other antisemitic cartoons drawn by him were discovered.\n\nAfter the contest, the Iranian House of Cartoon and the Sarcheshmeh Cultural Complex announced another similar contest, this time calling for cartoon submissions on the \"Zionist Caliphate\" that will focus on \"Zionism, terrorism and racism\" and \"ISIL terrorism and genocide in the name of religion and to the benefit of the Zionists.\" The deadline for entries has been set for 16 June 2016, with the winners to be announced at a later date with cash prizes of up to US$5,000.\n\n\n"}

According to CBC News, he was diagnosed with HIV in 1996. He had unprotected sex with 11 women without telling them he was HIV-positive. Seven of these women later tested positive for HIV, two of whom died of complications from AIDS in December 2003 and May 2004.\n\nSeveral Canadian courts have ruled that persons who are not informed that a sexual partner is HIV-positive cannot truly give consent to sex.\n\nAziga was arrested in August 2003.\nOn November 16, 2005, Justice Norman Bennett of Hamilton ruled there is sufficient evidence for Aziga to stand trial. His trial date was initially set for May 2007 but was moved back several times. As of May, 2008, the trial was set to begin October 6, 2008.\n\nThe decision to try Aziga was criticized by Richard Elliott, deputy director of the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network, who described the decision as \"not particularly helpful\" and argued that it may lead to a \"dominant impression out there of people living with HIV as potential criminals, which is not an accurate or fair representation.\"\n\nAziga was the first Canadian ever to be criminally convicted on charges for knowingly infecting others with the HIV virus without telling the victims. He was designated a dangerous offender. In an earlier case, Charles Ssenyonga of London, Ontario was prosecuted on the lesser charges of aggravated assault and criminal negligence causing bodily harm, although he died of meningitis before a verdict was rendered in his case.\n\nIn the 1999 decision \"R. v. Cuerrier\", the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that people who knowingly exposed/infected others to HIV through unprotected sex could be charged with a crime on the grounds that failure to disclose one's HIV status to a sex partner constitutes fraud.\n\nAziga's trial began in October 2008. Among the first revelations made in trial proceedings are claims by Aziga's former girlfriends that he lied about his HIV status and continued having unprotected sex until the morning of his arrest in 2003. Aziga's lawyers claim that no conclusive link can be shown to indicate that the deaths of his former girlfriends can be attributed to HIV/AIDS.\n\nOn April 4, 2009, Aziga was found guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree, 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault, and one count of attempted aggravated sexual assault by a jury made up of nine men and three women at Hamilton Superior Court. The murder convictions resulted from the fact that Canadian jurisprudence has established that failure to disclose one's HIV status before unprotected sex means that the partner cannot give consent (as they have been deliberately deprived of information that might cause a reasonable person to reconsider), resulting in the sexual act becoming aggravated sexual assault. Under Canadian law, any death resulting from aggravated sexual assault (i.e. the two women who died as a result of HIV/AIDS complications) is automatically murder in the first degree. Aziga was sentenced to life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 25 years, the mandatory sentence in Canada for a conviction of first-degree murder. Aziga has expressed his intention to appeal his conviction.\n\nOn August 2, 2011, a court in Hamilton, Ont. granted a request by Crown Prosecutors to have Johnson Aziga jailed indefinitely under the Dangerous Offender act, because he is believed to be at a high risk to re-offend.\n\n\n\n"}

The summit lasted from 29 August to 1 September and was attended by eight Arab heads of state: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, and Sudan. The resolution called for: a continued state of belligerency with Israel, ending the Arab oil boycott declared during the Six-Day War, an end to the North Yemen Civil War, and economic assistance for Egypt and Jordan. It is famous for containing (in the third paragraph) what became known as the \"Three No's\": \"no peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, no negotiations with it...\"\n\n\nCommentators have frequently presented the resolution as an example of Arab rejectionism. Efraim Halevy, Guy Ben-Porat, Steven R. David, Julius Stone, and Ian Bremmer all agree the Khartoum Resolution amounted to a rejection of Israel's right to exist. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) itself enlisted the Khartoum Resolution to advocate against acceptance of Israel's right to exist as articulated in United Nations Security Council Resolution 242.\nBenny Morris wrote that the Arab leaders \"hammered out a defiant, rejectionist platform that was to bedevil all peace moves in the region for a decade,\" despite an Israeli offer on June 19, 1967 \"to give up Sinai and the Golan in exchange for peace.\" Odd Bull of the UNTSO opined in much the same manner in 1976.\n\nAvi Shlaim has argued that Arab spokesmen interpreted the Khartoum declarations to mean \"no formal peace \"treaty\", but not a rejection of peace; no \"direct\" negotiations, but not a refusal to talk through third parties; and no \"de jure\" recognition of Israel, but acceptance of its existence as a state\" (emphasis in original). Shlaim states that the conference marked a turning point in Arab-Israeli relations, noting that Nasser urged Hussein to seek a \"comprehensive settlement\" with Israel. Shlaim acknowledges that none of this was known in Israel at the time, whose leaders took the \"three no's\" at face value. Fred Khouri argued that \"the Khartoum conference cleared the way for the Arab moderates to seek a political solution and to offer, in exchange for their conquered lands, important concessions short of actually recognizing Israel and negotiating formal peace treaties with her.” \n\nIn the event, indirect negotiations between Israel, Jordan and Egypt eventually opened through the auspices of the Jarring Mission (1967–1973), and secret direct talks also took place between Israel and Jordan, but neither avenue succeeded in achieving a meaningful settlement, setting the stage for a new round of conflict.\n\n"}
{"id": "2875636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2875636", "title": "Lent Bumps", "text": "Lent Bumps\n\nThe Lent Bumps (also Lent Races, Lents) are a set of rowing races held annually on the River Cam in Cambridge. They began in 1887, after separating from the May Bumps, which are bumping races held in mid-June. Prior to the separation there had been a single set of annual bumps dating from its inception in 1827. The races are open to all college boat clubs from the University of Cambridge, the University Medical and Veterinary Schools and Anglia Ruskin Boat Club. The Lent Bumps take place over five days (Tuesday to Saturday) at the end of February /start of March and are run as bumps races.\n\nThe most recent in the series was the Lent Bumps 2018, held from 27 February to 3 March 2018. On Wednesday 28 February three of the divisions were cancelled because of snow and ice on the towpath, then all racing was cancelled on Thursday 1 March, and the two lower divisions on Friday 2 March.\n\nThe races are run in divisions, each containing 17 crews. The number of crews in each bottom division varies yearly depending on new entrants. Each crew consists of eight rowers and one coxswain. Unlike the May Bumps, rowers trialling for places in university crews are not allowed to take part in the Lents. A total of 121 crews took part in 2012, totalling around 1100 participants. There are currently four divisions for men's crews (referred to as M1, M2 ... M4) and three divisions for women's crews (similarly W1–W3). The divisions represent an overall race order, with Division 1 at the top. The ultimate aim is to try to finish \"Head of the River\" (also said as gaining the 'Headship'), i.e. first position in Division 1.\n\nAt the start, signalled by a cannon, each crew is separated by a distance of about 1½ boat lengths (approximately 30 m or 90 ft). Once the race has begun, a crew must attempt to catch up with the crew ahead of it and \"bump\" (physically touch or overtake it) before the crew behind does the same to them. A crew which bumps or is bumped must pull to the side of the river to allow other crews to continue racing. A crew which neither bumps the crew ahead nor is bumped by the crew behind before crossing the finishing post is said to have \"rowed over\". Any crew which bumps then swaps places with the crew that it bumped in the following day's racing. A crew which rows over stays in the same position. Crews finishing at the top of a division, the \"sandwich boat\", row at the bottom of the next division to try to move up a division. The process is repeated over four days, allowing crews to move up or down in the overall order of boats. The finish order of one year's Lent Bumps is then used as the starting order of the following year's races.\n\nThe leading men's and women's crews of the Lent Bumps go on to race the leading Oxford Torpids men's and women's crews at the Henley Boat Races around Easter.\nLent Bumps were cancelled from 1915 to 1918 due to war, and in 1895 and 1963 due to ice. The Lents in 1888 were not completed due to the death of an oarsman. When the races ceased, were in 1st position. The Lent Bumps 2001 were not completed due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in the UK. The outbreak closed the towpath along the river, where all of the umpiring for the bumps takes place. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, were in 1st position.\n\nIn 1919, college 1st VIIIs did not race as it was the first race after World War I. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races. Prior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.\n\nNB. The Women's Lent Bumps were not completed in 2001 due to an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in the UK. When the races were abandoned on Friday 2 March 2001, were in 1st position.\n\nNineteen boats have been head of the river. \n\"*\" The head of the river in 1919 was, unusually, 1st Trinity’s second boat. It was the first race after World War I and 1st eights did not race. The start order for the 1920 races was the finish order for the 1914 races.\n\nPrior to 1946 were two separate rowing clubs: 1st Trinity and 3rd Trinity, hence both separate and combined titles.\n\nCCAT, Clare Hall, Darwin, Homerton, Hughes Hall, King's, Lucy Cavendish, Magdalene, Robinson, St. Catharine's, Selwyn, Sidney Sussex, St Edmund's, Wolfson, Addenbrooke's and the Veterinary School are the regular entrants never to have finished Head of the River in either the men's or women's events.\n\n\n"}

Most centered on specific refereeing decisions, which led many of the world's media to claim that the referees were spoiling the World Cup. Numerous World Cup records were also set by controversial calls, including Graham Poll's three-card error and Valentin Ivanov's record number of cards in a single match.\n\nFIFA's \"Fair Play\" agreement also came under intense scrutiny during the tournament, particularly during the second-round match between Portugal and Netherlands.\n\nThe deciding game for the Group F runners-up place, Croatia vs. Australia, saw English referee Graham Poll mistakenly issue three yellow cards to Croatian Josip Šimunić before sending him off. Šimunić was shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Australian Harry Kewell. In the 90th minute, Poll held up a yellow card in front of Šimunić for a foul, but did not follow it with a red card, as is required upon a second yellow card. In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll angrily and gave him a push. Poll thus issued Šimunić with a 3rd yellow card and also showed him the red card.\n\nQuestions were raised as to why Poll's assistants Phil Sharp and Glenn Turner, and fourth official Kevin Stott, had also failed to realise the error. Poll later denied any blame should be placed upon the other officials saying, \"I was the referee, it was my error and the buck stops with me\". Poll reported that the officials had felt \"disbelief\" upon hearing of the error in the dressing room after the game. He and the other officials consequently reviewed the DVD of the game, and Poll realised that his \"dream was over\".\n\nFootball Federation Australia chief executive John O'Neill later said that \"Australia could have had grounds for a very strong appeal should Croatia have won the match\". Poll also explained the reason for his mistake by saying that he \"incorrectly noted down the name of the Australia number three Craig Moore when booking Šimunić for the second time and failed to realise his error\" (Šimunić is Australian-born, hence speaks English with an Australian accent, probably causing the mistake).<ref>\n"}

The event began in 1960 and is held at the Lumberjack Bowl. There are 21 events for both men and women to compete for over $50,000 in prize money. Contestants come from the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The events include sawing, chopping, logrolling, and climbing to test the strength and agility of over 100 competitors.\n\nCompetitions by year:\n\nCompetitors saw through a white pine log for the fastest time. A starting cut arc is allowed in the competition. Timing begins when the signal \"GO\" is called and ends when the log is completely severed. The world record with a time of 11.61 seconds was set in 2006 by Nancy Zalewski.\n\nUsing a single bit pinned ax, competitors chop through a horizontal aspen log, in diameter, and long, for the fastest time. Nancy Zalewski held the world record in 2009 with a time of 29.24 seconds. Erin Lavoie claimed the record with a time of 25.38 seconds at the Manitoba Lumberjack Championship on Sept. 27, 2016.\n\nOpponents step onto a floating log, cuff it to start the roll, spin it rapidly in the water with their feet, stop or snub it suddenly by digging into the log with special caulked birling shoes and a reverse motion to maneuver their adversaries off balance and into the water, a feat called 'wetting'. Dislodging an opponent constitutes a fall. The cardinal rule of logrolling is 'never take your eyes off your opponent's feet'. The referee starts each match. Competing birlers step off a dock onto a floating log, grasping pike poles held by attendants for balance. As they push off from the dock, the referee instructs the birlers to steady the log. When he is certain both birlers have equal control, he says, 'Throw your poles'. The match is on and continues to a fall or to expiration of the time limit set for each log. When the time limit is reached, the same match continues onto the next smaller log. In all rounds, the contest is decided by the best three out of five falls. Women start on logs. In 2003 Tina Bosworth set a new world record of 10 wins.\n\nStarting on the log-rolling dock, two competitors run head to head on adjacent booms. Each competitor must step off the logrolling dock, running across a chain of logrolling logs to the chopping dock, circling a specified competition station and cross the pond on the boom logs back to the logrolling dock. The competitor must step onto the logrolling dock and touch the starting point. This is a timed event and is timed to the tenths of a second. Anyone leaving before the word \"go\" will be assessed a 10-second penalty.\n\nUsing a five-pound single-bit axe, competitors chop through a horizontal aspen log in diameter and long. Timing begins on the signal \"go\" and ends when the log is severed. A new world record was set in 2006 by Jason Wynyard with a time of 15.94. In 2007, competitors moved from the underhand chop to the standing block chop for one continuous timed event known as the endurance event.\n\nUsing a five-pound single-bit axe, competitors chop through a vertical standing aspen log in diameter and long. Timing begins on the \"go\" signal and ends when the log is severed. This event was combined with the men's underhand chop as the endurance or combination event in 2007. Competitors moved from the underhand chop to the standing block chop for one continuous timed event. The world record for the standing block chop is 12.33 seconds set by Jason Wynyard from New Zealand in 2007.\n\nThis event combines the skills of the chopper and the high climber. Out in the forest this technique enables a working lumberjack to reach softer wood above the tough and knotty base of a tree marked for cutting. Contestants climb a height of nine feet using two springboard placements and chop through a aspen log mounted on the top of the spar pole. Dave Bolstad set a new world record of 41.15 in 2003 besting his previous world record time of 41.63 in 2001.\n\nA single sawyer uses a one-man bucking saw to cut through a white pine log for the best time. Dion Lane set a new world record in 2006 with a time of 10.78 seconds.\n\nA single sawyer using a single-cylinder, single-motor power saw makes three vertical cuts—down, up and down—through a white pine log. This one-man contest is strictly against time. Chain saws may be warmed up prior to the contest, but must be turned off before the contest begins. Neither self-starting nor impulse-type push button starters nor twin motors are allowed. A starter gives the countdown and on the signal \"go\", competitors start their saws and make the three cuts. The contest ends when the third slice is severed. All cuts must be complete. Dave Bolstad of New Zealand holds the world record with a time of 5.55 seconds set in 2007.\n\nCompetitor scales a cedar spar pole and returns to the ground. Contestants perform on twin spar poles and they must climb within 240 degrees of the sparring pole, as marked. Event is strictly against time and begins when the signal \"go\" is given and ends when the contestant touches the ground after climbing to the 60-foot mark. At the starting signal, contestants must have one foot on the ground and the other foot below the orange line as marked on the sparring pole. The contestant must touch the pole every 15 feet on the descent. The two climbers use spurred climbers and steel-core climbing ropes to scale the spar poles. Only traditional spurs are allowed. Brian Bartow of Grants Pass, Oregon holds the world record of 12.33 seconds in this event.\n\nContestant scales an cedar spar pole and returns to the ground against time. Contestants compete on twin spar poles. Contestant must climb within the front 240 degrees of the sparring pole, as marked. Timing begins on the signal \"go\" and ends when the contestant touches the ground after ringing one of the two bells on top of the spar pole. At the starting signal, contestants must have one foot on the ground and the other foot below the orange line as marked on the sparring pole. On the descent climbers are required to touch inside each section. Contestants use spurred climbers and steel-core climbing ropes to scale the spar poles. In this climb Brian Bartow of Oregon holds the world record with a time of 19.87 set in 2006.\n\nIn competition opponents step onto a floating log, cuff it to start the roll, spin it rapidly in the water with their feet, stop or snub it suddenly by digging into the log with special caulked birling shoes and a reverse motion to maneuver their adversaries off balance and into the water, a feat called 'wetting'.

When the time limit is reached, the same match continues onto the next smaller log. In the semi-finals and the finals, the contest is decided by the best three out of five falls. Men start on logs.\n\nStarting on the log-rolling dock, two competitors run head to head on adjacent booms. Each competitor must step off the logrolling dock, running across a chain of logrolling logs to the chopping dock, circling a specified competition station and cross the pond on the boom logs back to the logrolling dock. The competitor must step onto the logrolling dock and touch the starting point. This is a timed event and is timed to the tenths of a second. Anyone leaving before the word \"go\" will be assessed a 10-second penalty.\n\nA bucking contests where a man and woman compete for the best time to cut through a white pine log. Starting cuts of no more than deep, in order to set the teeth of the saw, are allowed. Timing starts on the signal \"go\" and ends when the block is severed. Logs must be cut completely through. The world record for this event was set in 2005 by Jason and Karmyn Wynyard with a time of 6.17 seconds.\n\nTwo sawyers working as a team use a two-man bucking saw to cut through a white pine log. Double buck team consists of two men. A starting cut arc is allowed. Timing begins for both competitions when the signal to \"go\" is called, and ends when the log is completely severed. Jason Wynyard and Dion Lane hold the world record with a time of 4.77 seconds set in 2005.\n\nIn this timed event there are two teams competing. Each team consist of a 60-foot climber, 2 boom runners (1 male, 1 female), a hot sawyer, a women's single buck sawyer and a standing block chopper. First a climber must climb and descend the 60-foot pole, when their feet touch the pad it is the signal for the male boom runner stationed on the chopping dock to run the logs to the logrolling dock; when he touches the dock it is then the female boom runner's turn to run the logs over to the chopping dock, once touching there the hot saws then cut through a log and when the log drops the women commence the single buck, with the standing block chop the anchor event in this relay. Whichever team finishes first with the best time is the winner of the event. This event is the combination of the best of all the lumberjack skills: power, strength and sheer determination.\n\nThe All-Around Lady Jill Champion is awarded each year to the Lumber Jill who scores the most points. The key to the All-Around title is endurance and the ability to compete in as many events as possible. The top contestants in every event receive points each day of the competition, making it important to make it through early qualifying rounds in as many events as possible. Points are given each day for the top six places in each event, with a first place being awarded 6 points, second 5 points and so on. Logrollers will receive triple points for their final placement. This is because the final standings are the only opportunity for logrollers to earn points. Women's All-Around events are the underhand chop, single buck, Jack and Jill, logrolling and the boom run. The 2009 winner was Nancy Zalewski of Wisconsin, who has now taken home the crown five times.\n\nThe Tony Wise All-Around Champion, named after the founder of the Lumberjack World Championships, is awarded each year to the lumberjack who scores the most points. The key to the All-Around title is endurance and the ability to compete in as many events as possible. The top contestants in every event receive points each day of competition, making it important to make it through early qualifying rounds in as many events as possible. Points are given each day for the top six places in each event, with a first place being awarded 6 points, second 5 points and so on. There are two exceptions to this. Due to the nature of the springboard chop and logrolling, the all-around points for these two events will be scored differently. For the springboard, the sixth fastest competitors from Friday's and Saturday's heats receive double the points. This is because springboard competitors only get one opportunity to earn all-around points. 5th and 6th placements are awarded triple points for their final placement. This is because the final standings are the only opportunity for logrollers to earn points. The Tony Wise All-Around events are: underhand chop, standing chop, springboard chop, double buck, single buck, hot saw, Jack & Jill, logrolling, boom run, 60-foot climb and 90-foot climb. Jason Wynyard, who was the 2009 winner, has taken home the crown for 11 years in a row.\n\nThe event is sponsored by various companies such as Stihl, Plum Creek Timber, SBI Pepsi, and the local radio stations.\n\n"}

The seven-year-old was raped and murdered by her neighbor Jesse Timmendequas. The murder attracted national attention and subsequently led to the introduction of \"Megan's Law\", which requires law enforcement to disclose details relating to the location of registered sex offenders.\n\nJesse K. Timmendequas (born April 15, 1961) had two previous convictions for sexually assaulting young girls. In 1979, he pleaded guilty to the attempted aggravated sexual assault of a five-year-old girl in Piscataway Township, New Jersey. He was given a suspended sentence, and after failing to go to counseling, he was sent for nine months to the Middlesex Adult Correctional Center. In 1981, Timmendequas pleaded guilty in regards to the assault of a seven-year-old girl, and was imprisoned at the Adult Diagnostic & Treatment Center (ADTC) in Avenel, New Jersey, for six years.\n\nTimmendequas reportedly participated little in the treatment program offered at the ADTC. He was described by one therapist who treated him at the facility as a \"whiner\" who spent most of his time sleeping. Another therapist stated that she had believed that Timmendequas would eventually commit another sex crime (although she did not believe he would commit murder).\n\nTimmendequas lured Kanka into his house, raped her, and then killed her by strangulation with a belt. He then placed her body in nearby Mercer County Park. The next day, he confessed to investigators and led police to the site.\n\nEvidence included bloodstains, hair, and fiber samples, as well as a bite mark matching Kanka's teeth on Timmendequas' hand, and led to a guilty verdict on charges of kidnapping, four counts of aggravated sexual assault, and two counts of felony murder—causing a death in the course of certain specific felonies. The court sentenced Timmendequas to death, and the sentence was upheld by the New Jersey Supreme Court on appeal. Congressman Dick Zimmer stated, \"I believe he is exactly the kind of predator that the legislature had in mind when it enacted the death penalty.\"\n\nTimmendequas remained on New Jersey's Death Row until December 17, 2007, when the New Jersey Legislature abolished the state's death penalty. As a result of the ban, Timmendequas' sentence was commuted to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nOne month after the murder, the New Jersey General Assembly passed a series of bills proposed by Assemblyman Paul Kramer that would require sex offender registry, with a database tracked by the state, community notification of registered sex offenders moving into a neighborhood and then life in prison for repeat sex offenders. Kramer expressed incredulity at the controversy created by the bills, saying that \"Megan Kanka would be alive today\" if the bills he proposed had been law.\n\nThe Megan Nicole Kanka Foundation is a non-profit charity founded by the family of Megan Kanka with the intent of preventing crimes against children.\n\n"}

From their efforts, the \"Survivor Benefit Plan\" came into being. In the ensuing years, NMFA has been in the vanguard of advocacy for improvements in the quality of military family life. The name of the organization was changed in 1984 to reflect the broad scope of its involvement. NMFA is a non-profit 501(c)(3).\n\nNMFA has members from all ranks of the seven uniformed services worldwide and their families. Its Board of Governors, which includes active duty service members, reserve component, retirees and spouses, sets the policies, approves the issues, and oversees operations. Governors and officers receive no financial compensation, and volunteers assist in carrying out NMFA programs. It is also supported by distinguished Board of Advisers.\nNMFA receives significant support at the top levels of the Services and works regularly on common concerns with The Military Coalition, an umbrella organization of 36 military-related associations.\n\nNMFA activities revolve around programs to educate the public, the military community, and the Congress on the rights and benefits of military families, as well as advocate for an equitable quality of life for those families.\n\nMembers of the \"Government Relations Department\" study issues, testify before Congressional committees, work with Congressional staff and represent NMFA on advisory groups for many Department of Defense agencies, to include the Defense Commissary Agency Patron Council and the TRICARE Beneficiary Panel.\n\nSince its inception in 1969, the effectiveness of NMFA is reflected in accomplishments in most of the issue areas in which the association works. These include medical and dental benefits, dependent education, retiree and survivor benefits, relocation and spousal employment. NMFA staff speaks regularly to all types of groups, including family service organizations, Commanders' Conferences, and officer and enlisted spouse clubs.\n\nNMFA sponsors a military spouse scholarship program, as well as the \"NMFA Very Important Patriot Award\", which recognizes outstanding volunteers in the military community, and the \"NMFA Family Award\", which recognizes families that exemplify the best of the military lifestyle.\n\nIn 2004, it published an analysis of military family support, entitled \"Serving the Homefront: An Analysis of Military Family Support Since September 11, 2001\".\n\nNMFA sponsors \"Operation Purple Camps\" for children of deployed service members in many U.S. military communities around the world.\n\nNMFA's \"The Voice for Military Families\" is dedicated to providing information to and representing the interests of family members of the uniformed services.

The NSG was led by Khalifa al-Ghawi. The term Libya Dawn Coalition was used to refer to the armed groups and/or the wider political movement supporting the NSG. The NSG was one of the major sides in the ongoing Second Libyan Civil War from its formation August 2014 until its dissolution in April 2016.\nA faction of the General National Congress claimed to be the legitimate parliament of Libya, but does not represent a majority of the membership of that congress, refused to handover the power to the HoR. The majority of the GNC members belonged to groups now participating in the internationally recognized Libyan parliament, the House of Representatives.\n\nThe NSG was backed by the Muslim Brotherhood's Libyan party, the Justice and Construction Party, and the \"Loyalty to Martyrs Bloc\" which consists of other smaller groups allied to the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nAfter their landslide defeat in the 2014 elections dominated by low turnout, Islamist parties acting under the leadership of Nouri Abusahmain used two armed groups, the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room and Libya Shield Force, to take control of the capital Tripoli. In late August, Islamist militias allegedly abducted rivals (whose whereabouts are unknown) and attacked 280 homes. The NSG has rejected affiliation with any of these activities and it is unknown who the exact perpetrators were with both sides blaming each other\n\nThe leader of the GNC, Nouri Abusahmain, had appointed Omar al-Hassi then Khalifa al-Ghawi as prime ministers.\n\nMembers of the House of Representatives and the General National Congress signed a United Nations supported political agreement on 17 December 2015. Under the terms of the agreement, a nine-member Presidency Council and a seventeen-member interim Government of National Accord would be formed, with a view to holding new elections within two years. The House of Representatives would continue to exist as a legislature and an advisory body, to be known as the High Council of State, will be formed with members nominated by the General National Congress. \n\nThe Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fayez al-Sarraj, arrived in Tripoli on 30 March 2016. The following day, it was reported that the GNA has taken control of the prime ministerial offices and that the GNC appointed Prime Minister Khalifa al-Ghawi had fled to Misrata. On 1 April 2016, the head of the media bureau of the National Salvation Government announced that the NSG has resigned and handed its authority back to the General National Congress. Media reports have also claimed that the General National Congress had \"virtually disintegrated\".\n\nOn April 5, the National Salvation Government of the General National Congress announced that it was resigning, \"ceasing operations\" and ceding power to the Presidential Council. Following the dissolution of the GNC, former members of that body declared the establishment of the State Council, as envisaged by the LPA.\n\nOn 15 October 2016, forces loyal to the NSG took over the building of the High Council of State and announced the comeback of the Ghawil cabinet. Then fighting occurred between Sarraj loyalists and Ghawil forces.\n\nThe fighting spread to other areas of Tripoli on 14 March. The Pro-GNA forces had recaptured the Guest Palace complex as well as the Rixos hotel. The channel was taken off-air while Khalifa Al-Ghawil was also reported by one of his aides to have been injured in the clashes. An agreement called for withdrawal of all armed groups from Tripoli in 30 days. \n\nOn 28 May, the 7th Brigade of the Presidential Guard (Al-Kani brigade) from Tarhuna, took over the Tripoli International Airport as a neutral side after Misratan militias loyal to Khalifa Ghwell withdrew from there following two days of heavy clashes. By the next day, the city of Tripoli was fully under control of pro-GNA forces, with all pro-GNC forces withdrawing as a result of clashes with pro-GNA forces.\n\n"}

The French garrison had been surrounded by the communist Viet Minh during the First Indochina War. As a result of the operation cancellation, the French Army organised the Operation Condor.\n\nViet Minh forces under General Võ Nguyên Giáp surrounded and besieged the French, who were unaware of the Viet Minh's possession of heavy artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. The attack that formally began the battle was launched 13 March 1954. French artillery outposts fell within hours, and a dismal trickle of wounded survivors into Dien Bien Phu’s garrison hospital began. The French tried to hit back with artillery and airpower, including some 30 US C-119 Flying Boxcars which had modified to drop napalm on the Viet Minh artillery and flown mainly by American employees of Civil Air Transport, the contract airline founded by Maj. Gen. Claire Lee Chennault, the head of the World War II Flying Tigers. Dien Bien Phu could be supplied only via airdrop, and dropping and retrieving supplies became a nightmare as Viet Minh artillery shrank the effective size of the drop zone. On 27 March, French Col. Jean Louis Nicot, the man in charge of the aerial resupply effort, had to raise the drop altitude from 2,000 feet to 8,000 feet. Drop zone accuracy declined, and some supplies inevitably fell into Viet Minh hands. The French, with the encouragement of some US officials based in Saigon, pressed hard for the US to launch an overwhelming air strike to save Dien Bien Phu.\n\nJust ten days after the start of Giap’s initial assault, General Paul Ely, the French Chief of Staff, arrived in Washington to plead the French case to US policy-makers. Discussions involved General Ely, U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n\nThe plan included as many as 98 B-29s from Okinawa and the Philippines that would drop 1400 tonnes of bombs on positions held by the Viet Minh. Another version of the plan envisioned sending 60 B-29s from US bases in the region, supported by as many as 150 fighters launched from US Seventh Fleet carriers, to bomb Giap’s positions.\n\nThe plan included an option to use up to three small atomic weapons on the Viet Minh positions in support of the French. The Joint Chiefs of Staff drew up plans to deploy tactical atomic weapons, U.S. carriers sailed to the Tonkin gulf, and reconnaissance flights over Dien Bien Phu were conducted during the negotiations. Radford, the top American military officer, gave this nuclear option his backing. US B-29s, B-36s, and B-47s could have executed a nuclear strike, as could carrier aircraft from the Seventh Fleet.\n\nNixon, a so-called \"hawk\" on Vietnam, suggested that the U.S. might have to \"put American boys in\". President Eisenhower made American participation contingent on British support, but London was opposed. Eisenhower also felt that the airstrike alone would not decide the battle. He also expressed concerns that the French Air Force was insufficiently developed for this sort of operation and did not want to escalate U.S. involvement in the war by using American pilots. In the end, convinced that the political risks outweighed the possible benefits, he decided against the intervention.\n\n\n\n"}

The brigades were assigned to six ugdas, or division-size task forces, whose composition varied according to their assigned mission and geographical area.\n\nMinister of Defense – General Moshe Dayan\n\nChief of Staff – Lt.

The field fortifications were held by eight brigades of which five were infantry brigades, each with an attached tank battalion of T-34/85s and SU-100 self-propelled guns, holding the first two lines and three armoured and mechanized brigades along and behind the third line. In addition there were four reserve infantry brigades deployed between Damascus and Kuneitra, as well as seven battalions of the National Guard militia that were deployed to bolster the defensive lines. These forces were divided into 'Group Brigades' in Syrian terminology although this was an administrative convenience rather than a tactical deployment.\n\nMinister of Defense Hafez Al-Assad.\n\nArmy Chief of Staff Ahmad Suwaydani.\n\nChief of Staff Amer Khammash.\n\nThe 55,000-man Jordanian Army was divided into the Eastern and Western commands, with the division marked by the Jordan River. In June 1967, the bulk of the Jordanian forces was deployed in the West Bank in two main areas: in Samaria in the north, based in and around the towns of Jenin and Nablus and in the south in the area from Ramallah through Jerusalem down to Hebron.\n\nWestern Command\n\nEastern Command\n\nofficial strength of 210,000 men in June 1967, the Egyptian Army had some 100,000 troops in the Sinai Peninsula and approximately 50,000 in Yemen with the remainder stationed to the west of the Suez Canal to protect Cairo.

Vasudevan Nair and directed by Hariharan, music by Bombay Ravi and lyrics by O N V Kurup. It stars Geetha, Mohanlal, Nadia Moidu and Thilakan.\n\nA remarkable tale of a remarkable woman, who puts her commitment to social activism above everything else, including her own love for an adoring man. Under the direction of Hariharan, Geetha made a sensational debut in Malayalam in one of the most powerful female characters in Indian cinema ever. It is one of the classics in Malayalam cinema. The film was remade in Tamil as \"Nyaya Tharasu\" (1989).\n\nThe movie revolves round the incidents in a two-week period, when Indira (Geetha), a Naxal activist is out in parole. She is serving life sentence in the central jail, Kannore after being charged for the murder of Avarachan, a landlord, who she had witnessed kill a young tribal woman after she was raped and impregnated (by him).\n\nIndira's mother, a past freedom fighter who is on her deathbed, is relieved to see her, and is under the impression that she is free now. Her younger sister Savithri (Nadiya Moidu), her husband Prabhakaran (Devan) and her nephew are happy to have her back home. But her younger brother, Ravi (Meghanathan), an unemployed guy, addicted to drugs is angered by her mere presence, blaming her for his inability to secure a good job. Indira's older brother who is home from Delhi to perform the death rites of her mother refuses to even talk to her, and leaves after a big brouhaha, leaving his nephew to do the rites. Most of her acquaintances are intimidated by her, except her old classmate Sharadha (Chitra). Sharadha had married her college sweetheart, Rajan (Murali) and lives close to Indira's home.\n\nRasheed (Mohanlal), a freelance journalist, tries to get an interview with Indira, she declines initially and is annoyed by his persistence.\n\nAs the days pass on, Indira feels unwanted, and ends up having no place to live. Savithri suspects an affair between her husband and Indira, making it hard for Indira to stay with them. Sharadha's husband had changed a lot in years, had degraded into a womanizer, and Indira can't stay with them either. Ultimately Indira, asks Rasheed for help her out and ends up staying at his place.\nWith time, Indira and Rasheed get closer, and a lovely relationship blossoms between the two. As Indira is nearing the completion of her parole, Rasheed, with great difficulty, succeeds in getting the government remission order in time, so that Indira no longer has to go back to jail. By this time Savithri and Ravi reconcile with Indira, and are overjoyed to hear about her release. Indira rushes to Sharadha's place to share the good news, but there she is shocked to see Sharadha's servant, a young teenage girl, being gang-raped by her husband Rajan and friends. True to her righteous self, Indira ends up shooting Rajan with his hunting rifle and ultimately surrenders herself at the police station.\n\n\nHariharan about Mohanlal's casting, \"\"Panchagni\" was mainly Geetha's film, but when we asked Mohanlal whether he would do the film as Naseeruddin Shah was already selected, he said he would do 'any role'. The first thing I wanted was to give him a different appearance. Till then, he hadn't appeared without a moustache. So I asked him to shave it off. He immediately agreed. \"Panchagni\" went on to become a turning point in his career.\".\n\n"}
{"id": "51049154", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=51049154", "title": "Premiership of Theresa May", "text": "Premiership of Theresa May\n\nThe premiership of Theresa May began on 13 July 2016, when May accepted Queen Elizabeth II's invitation to form a government. This followed the resignation of May's predecessor as Prime Minister, David Cameron, who resigned in the aftermath of the European Union membership referendum.\n\nIn a referendum held on 23 June 2016, Britain voted to withdraw from the European Union, with a result of 52% for withdrawal and 48% for remaining within the union. David Cameron, who as prime minister had campaigned to remain within the European Union, announced on 24 June 2016, immediately following the announcement of the referendum results, that he would resign from his post. Following the first stages of a Conservative Party leadership election, Home Secretary Theresa May's only remaining competitor, Andrea Leadsom, withdrew from the race on 11 July 2016. Following this announcement, David Cameron said that he would step down from his post on 13 July. Cameron formally tendered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on that day, who subsequently appointed Theresa May as his successor.\n\nAfter being appointed by Queen Elizabeth II on 13 July 2016, May became the United Kingdom's second female Prime Minister, after Margaret Thatcher, and the first female UK Prime Minister of the 21st century. May told the media on 11 July 2016 that she was \"honoured and humbled\" to be the party leader and to become prime minister.\n\nResponding to some calls for a general election (reported by the news media) to confirm her mandate, \"sources close to Mrs May\" said there would be no such election, according to the BBC. In a speech after her appointment, May emphasised the term Unionist in the name of the Conservative Party, reminding all of \"the precious, precious bond between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\" By 15 July 2016, May had travelled to Edinburgh, Scotland to meet with first minister Nicola Sturgeon, to reinforce the bond between Scotland and the rest of the country. \"This visit to Scotland is my first as prime minister and I'm coming here to show my commitment to preserving this special union that has endured for centuries,\" she explained. After the meeting at Bute House, May offered the following comment about Scotland's role in the negotiations about the UK's exit from the EU. \"I'm willing to listen to options and I've been very clear with the first minister today that I want the Scottish government to be fully engaged in our discussion.\"\n\nIn August 2016, May launched an investigation aimed at identifying and reducing racism in the public sector.\n\nMay triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union to leave the EU in March 2017.\n\nAs part of the government's plan to curb childhood obesity, May took steps to reduce sugar content of foods though many experts feel that too little is being done. Notably there are widespread calls for curbing advertising of unhealthy foods to children and banning promotions of unhealthy food (such as multipacks and buy one get one free) in supermarkets, restaurants, cafes and take-aways.\n\nConsultation will start over cost saving, streamlining and reduction of some services in the National Health Service. Critics fear cuts that could put lives at risk though the review is about more than reducing costs. An article in \"The Guardian\" suggests possible benefits from the review but fears secrecy within the NHS is hindering effective public discussion. Liberal Democrat Norman Lamb accepted the review makes sense in principle but stated \"While it is important that the NHS becomes more efficient and sustainable for future generations, redesign of care models will only get us so far – and no experts believe the Conservative doctrine that an extra £8bn funding by 2020 will be anywhere near enough.\"\n\nIn September 2016, David Cameron resigned as an MP, saying that he did not want to be a \"distraction\" for the new PM. Toby Helm wrote in \"The Observer\" in September 2016 that May is seen as less right wing than Cameron, but she is also seen as quite right wing by Rebecca Glover in \"The Independent\", especially on immigration.\n\nIn September 2016, May announced that she would end a ban on new grammar schools. A \"BBC\" article suggests grammar schools would be dumbed down while other secondary schools in the area would suffer. Jon Coles of United Learning, which runs 60 schools is unconvinced more grammar schools will raise standards. Poor children and children from families that are 'just about managing' tend to miss out on grammar school places. None of the top ten nations with the best education has UK style grammar schools selecting at age 11. The Royal Society commissioned research from the Education Policy Institute which shows disadvantaged pupils do worse overall in science and maths in regions with selective education. A cross party Select Committee of MP's described the issue of grammar school expansion as an unnecessary distraction, cast doubt on the claim grammar schools improve social mobility and many speakers emphasized the need to tackle funding problems effect on the whole of schooling. Following the outcome of the 2017 General Election, May's grammar school policy was not included in the Queen's Speech, and is unlikely to be pursued.\n\nThe 'Child Poverty Unit' has been merged with the 'Department of Work and Pensions' leading to fears that child poverty will be less of a priority under May. This runs counter to May's pledge to govern for everyone and fight the injustice of being born poor. In 2014–2015 28% of UK children were poor. The Child Poverty Action Group fears restricting the Child Poverty Unit to one department will reduce its effectiveness. The Institute for Fiscal Studies projects a 50% increase in child poverty by 2020 due to benefit cuts and 'sluggish wages'.\n\nMay also appointed new Cabinet members, in \"one of the most sweeping government reshuffles for decades\" described as \"a brutal cull\" by \"The Telegraph\" since several prominent members, including six of Cameron's ministers, were removed from their posts. The early appointments were interpreted both as \"centrist and conciliatory,\" an effort to reunite the party in the wake of the UK's vote to leave the European Union, and as \"a shift to the right,\" according to \"The Guardian\". Robert Peston of \"ITV News\" specifically labelled her new Cabinet as right wing.\n\nMay abolished the Department for Energy and Climate Change in a move widely criticised by Greenpeace which expressed concern the new government failed to see the threat from climate change, Friends of the Earth which said climate change is happening now while the new government lowers its priority, also by other more impartial people and groups. Climate change is included in the scope of a new Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.\n\nUpon becoming Prime Minister, May appointed former Mayor of London Boris Johnson to Foreign Secretary, former Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Amber Rudd to Home Secretary, and former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis to the newly created office of \"Brexit Secretary.\" Her choice of Boris Johnson for foreign secretary raised eyebrows, and drew some criticism from the press. Liam Fox and Philip Hammond, both of whom had previously served as Secretary of State for Defence (Fox in 2010–11 and Hammond in 2011–14), with Hammond having served as Foreign Secretary in 2014–16, were appointed to the newly created office of International Trade Secretary and Chancellor, respectively. Replacing Michael Gove, Elizabeth Truss was made Justice Secretary, the \"first female Lord Chancellor in the thousand-year history of the role\". Andrea Leadsom, who was energy minister and May's primary competitor for party leader, was made the new Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, former Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers resigned from Cabinet after May offered her a post which was \"not one which I felt I could take on\".\n\nMay jointly appointed Fiona Hill and Nick Timothy on 14 July as her joint Downing Street Chiefs of Staff. Both had been political advisers to her at the Home Office before both working outside the government for a brief period before coming to work on her leadership campaign. The three ministers with new roles who will negotiate the UK out of the EU had all espoused the Leave vote: David Davis, Brexit secretary, Liam Fox, overseas trade secretary and Boris Johnson, foreign secretary.\n\nOn 20 July, May attended her first Prime Minister's Questions since taking office, then afterwards made her first overseas trip as prime minister, visiting Berlin for talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. During the visit, May said that she would not trigger Article 50 before 2017, suggesting it would take time for the UK to negotiate a \"sensible and orderly departure\" from the EU. May also announced that in the wake of the referendum, Britain would relinquish the presidency of the Council of the European Union that the UK had been scheduled to hold in the second half of 2017.\n\nOn 4 September, May attended the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit, the first since the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. May sought to use the summit to emphasise her commitment to making the UK a \"global leader in free trade\" She also faced questions over the decision to delay planned Chinese investment in Hinkley Point C.\n\nOn 21 January 2017, following the inauguration of Donald Trump as US President, the White House announced that May would meet the President on 27 January, making her the first foreign leader to meet Trump since he took office on 20 January.\n\nThe May Ministry delayed the final approval for the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station in July 2016, a project which May had objected to when she was Home Secretary. Her political adviser Nick Timothy wrote an article in 2015 to oppose People's Republic of China's involvement in sensitive sectors. He said that the government was \"selling our national security to China\" without rational concerns and \"the Government seems intent on ignoring the evidence and presumably the advice of the security and intelligence agencies.\"\n\nPoliticians and human rights activists have been urging Theresa May's government to vote against Saudi Arabian retention of the membership of the UN Human Rights Council. Amnesty International's UK Foreign Policy Programme Director Polly Truscott said: \"Rather than turning a blind eye to Saudi Arabia’s continuing bully tactics, the UK should publicly hold the Saudi authorities to account for its appalling human rights record and the ongoing war crimes in Yemen and should stop selling weapons to Saudi as a matter of urgency.\" May defended selling arms to Saudi Arabia stating that close ties with the country \"keep people on the streets of Britain safe\".\n\nPrior to her premiership, May outlined plans to backtrack on the longstanding government plan to achieve a surplus by 2020, following the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. With uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook, Chancellor of the Exchequer Phillip Hammond has suggested that the government's Autumn Statement may be used to \"reset\" economic policy. \n\nOn 2015, while May was Home Secretary, a 18% funding cut in the police force had taken place with the loss of around 20,000 police officers. Before the 2017 Manchester Arena bombing and after the Paris attacks, she was warned by a Manchester senior police officer that the cuts on the force and community policing risked terror attacks in the city due the lack of resources to do proper intelligence and anti-terrorist measures.\n\nIn May's and Hammond's 2017 budget continued government policies of freezing benefits.\n\nMay has not given MPs a vote over the European Union despite in 2007 calling for MPs to have the right of veto over European talks. Nicky Morgan stated \"in 2016 MPs aren't asking for a veto but they do want a say and we hope the Prime Minister will remember her earlier words\". Anna Soubry and Nick Clegg also called for more parliamentary involvement. In November 2016, the High Court ruled in R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union that parliament must vote on the decision to leave the EU but May appealed to the Supreme Court. Nicola Sturgeon, Scottish First Minister has joined the case as have representatives of Wales and Northern Ireland. Sturgeon feels the Scottish Parliament should also consent to the UK triggering of Article 50. She says she will not seek to prevent England and Wales leaving but wants to preserve Scotland's place in the EU. In the end the Supreme Court required a vote in the UK parliament.\n\nMay was accused of not having a plan if Brexit talks break down. There are fears if talks fail Britain could be left trading under WTO rules which it is feared would seriously damage jobs and livelihoods in Britain and Europe. May's ministers have repeatedly promised to walk away from a bad final deal but, it is argued, have no plans for how to manage without a deal. Ivan Rogers described May's Brexit strategy as “an accident waiting to happen”. He said completing Brexit was “guaranteed” to take a decade and alleged May's unrealistic hopes of a trade deal made to order meant a car crash in the next few months was “quite likely”.\n\nIn July 2016 May said that she planned to have workers represented on company boards, saying \"If I'm prime minister ... we're going to have not just consumers represented on company boards, but workers as well.\" May aimed to put workers' and consumers' representatives on boards to make them more accountable. Nils Pratley, a journalist at \"The Guardian\", wrote in July \"Fundamental principles of Britain's boardroom governance are being rethought. It is a very welcome development. In the more enlightened quarters of the UK corporate world, they can see that boardroom pay has eroded trust in business.\" Workers' representatives it appeared, would have made UK companies more like those in Germany and France. May was accused of backtracking in November 2016 when she said that firms would not be forced to adopt the proposal, saying \"there are a number of ways in which that can be achieved\".\n\nTheresa May was strongly criticised in the United Kingdom by members of all major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Donald Trump's Executive Order 13769 (colloquially known as the \"Muslim ban\") as well as for inviting Trump to a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nMore than 1.8 million signed an official parliamentary e-petition which said that \"Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,\" and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said in Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain \"while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees' and women's rights\" and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until the bar on Muslims entering the US is lifted.\n\nBaroness Warsi, former chair of the Conservatives, accused May of \"bowing down\" to Trump, who she described as \"a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion clearly for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric.\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, also called for the visit to be cancelled.\n\nMay is considering forcing companies to reveal the difference between what their CEOs are paid and what their ordinary workers are paid.\n\nFollowing the impact of \"Blue Planet II\" in 2017, the May administration outlined plans to approve further green policy. A particular focus has been on plastic and its impact on the environment. In March 2018, May announced plans for a plastic deposit scheme modelled on a similar policy in Norway to boost recycling. \n\nOn 18 April 2017, in a surprise statement made outside 10 Downing Street, May announced that she was to seek parliamentary approval for an early election to be held. She explained that, following the country's decision last summer to leave the European Union, she had \"only recently and reluctantly come to this conclusion\" and that although she had \"said that there should be no election until 2020\", that she had \"concluded that the only way to guarantee certainty and stability for the years ahead is to hold this election and seek your support for the decisions I must take.\" May previously indicated through a spokesperson she had no plan for a general election, the spokesperson stated, “There isn’t going to be one. It isn’t going to happen. There is not going to be a general election.” She denied there would be an election many times. On 19 April 2017 MPs gave May the two-thirds super-majority required to call the snap election she had called for. MPs voted 522 in favour and 13 against, giving the go-ahead for the election to be held on 8 June 2017.\nAs of 9 June 2017 the Conservative Party lost seats and Labour gained seats. The Conservatives remained the largest single party but without an absolute majority. In the immediate aftermath of the election, it was unclear if Theresa May would continue as Prime Minister. May stated that she would have an informal understanding with the DUP to keep the Conservatives in government.\n\nOn 10 June 2017 10 Downing Street issued a statement that a Conservative–DUP agreement was reached in principle. A few hours later, the statement was retracted when it was claimed that it had been \"issued in error\" and that talks between the Conservative Party and DUP were still ongoing.\n\nOn 11 June 2017 former Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, described May as a \"dead woman walking\".\n\nThe Grenfell Tower fire, Windrush scandal, Universal Credit and Brexit all caused problems for May's government. The UK government is struggling with Brexit and cannot easily reach an agreement that is acceptable to the Conservative party, to Conservative MP's or to the cabinet. How to manage the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic is one major problem.\n\nPotential candidates for a future general election are reluctant to put their names forward. Suspected reasons include being demoralized by May's premiership and lack of confidence that the Conservatives can win.\n\nFollowing the announcement of May's controversial draft withdrawal agreement, the deal received widespread criticism and at least 23 Conservative MP's proceeded to submit a letter demanding a vote of no confidence (a total 48 letters from MP's are needed trigger one). In addition to this, 4 ministers, including cabinet members Esther McVey and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned over the deal. However, a poll of 505 Conservative councillors found that a majority wanted MPs to back the prime minister, despite the fact that more were against the deal than for it.\n\nFollowing Cabinet agreement for May's proposals on Brexit, David Davis resigned from his government position on 8 July 2018. Following that, Steve Baker also resigned. On the same day it was reported that Theresa May was facing the threat of a leadership contest amid mounting anger from Brexiteers over her government's Brexit policy. Conservative Party backbencher Andrea Jenkyns called on for the Prime Minister to be replaced. saying “Theresa May's premiership is over”. Boris Johnson also later resigned as Foreign Secretary on 9 July 2018.\nIn July 2018, it was announced The UK government said it will not object to the United States seeking the death penalty for two suspected British members of ISIL. Waiving its long-standing objection to foreign executions.\n\n"}

{"id": "3456080", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3456080", "title": "ProStars", "text": "ProStars\n\nProStars is a cartoon television show featured on Saturday morning cartoon. It was produced by DiC and aired on NBC from September 14 to December 7, 1991. Three famous and popular professional athletes from the 1990s appear in the show in live action and as fictional super hero characters: Michael Jordan, Wayne Gretzky and Bo Jackson.\n\nOriginally intended to air on ESPN, the show centers on Michael Jordan, Bo Jackson and Wayne Gretzky fighting crime, helping children, and often protecting the environment as well. These three were chosen to represent the pinnacle of all four major American professional sports in the early 1990s. While Jordan and Gretzky are broadly associated with their respective sports, Jackson was included since he could represent both football and baseball and was a high-profile celebrity off the field as well. A reference to his \"Bo Knows\" Nike ad-campaign was worked into almost every episode.\n\nThe stars appear in live-action sequences before the show, in which they would tell kids about the upcoming episode, and often answer questions from kids at the conclusion. Normally this is done solely by Gretzky and Jackson—often in separate sound stages and edited to appear as if talking to each other. Jordan's filmed bits were almost always one line or two, and not part of the skits before the episode. Most of the live-action parts by the athletes dealt with things such as morality. In one episode they explained ghosts stating that even they get scared sometimes, and that fear is a normal human emotion. In an episode with robot athletes, they explained how such an idea will never come to reality, as it goes against the dedication men put into their sport. However, during the animated segments of \"ProStars\", their animated counterparts were voiced by voice actors instead of their actual selves.\n\nWhen the show first came out, the original theme song, \"We Are ProStars\", was an homage to the song \"We Will Rock You\", by the rock group, Queen (see links below). In later episodes, the song was slowed down, and the chorus was reduced to 'ProStars! Show staaaars! The lyrics also reference the \"Bo Knows\" ad campaign, including the line \"Bo knows everything.\"\n\nEach character on \"ProStars\" has one stand-out character trait, especially the ProStars themselves:\n\n\nIn nearly every episode the ProStars would get a message by teleconference from a child explaining the situation such as a little boy from an island in the South Seas who said his village's treasures were being stolen by Short John Silver.\n\nMost of the villains were standard cartoon fare and had often done villainous acts akin to cartoons of the early 1990s (such as \"Captain Planet\" and \"Free Willy\"), namely environmental irresponsibility such as strip mining, coastal pollution, or deforestation of the rainforest.\n\nOther times, a villain might hold a child for ransom, such as a mad scientist named Dr. Lobe who demanded the ProStars play his line of robot athletes in order to release a little girl he kidnapped. Episodes also touched upon kids in gangs, where an Australian village is being held captive by Gargantus' motorcycle gang and a little girl's brother joins the gang thinking they are macho to which Michael Jordan tells the little girl she cannot stop having faith or love in her brother. One episode dealt with the larceny of the Stanley Cup committed by Clockwork Delaronge (which is a personal issue for Wayne Gretzky as his name is carved on it four times) and he tells kids of the history and prestige of the award.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Similar referendums failed to pass in 1974 and 1988.\n\nThe proposed constitutional alteration was passed by both Houses of Parliament as the Constitution Alteration (Local Government) 2013.\n\nThe \"yes\" campaign was supported by both the government and opposition leader Tony Abbott.\n\nThe federal government allocated $10 million to the \"yes\" campaign, but just $500,000 to the \"no\" campaign. The difference in funding led seven senators from the Coalition to vote against the referendum bill in the Senate, although it passed by 46 votes to eight.\n\nSection 128 of the Constitution requires a proposed constitutional amendment be submitted to the electors in a referendum no less than two months but no later than six months after passage.

Historically, rape has been defined as forced sexual intercourse initiated against a woman or man by one or several people, without consent. In recent years, several revisions to the definition of rape have been made to the law of Sweden, to include not only intercourse but also comparable sexual acts against someone incapable of giving consent, due to being in a vulnerable situation, such as a state of fear or unconsciousness. In 2018, Sweden has passed a new law that criminalizes sex without consent as rape, even when there are no \nthreats, coercion or violence involved.\n\nIn 2014, there were 6,697 rapes reported to the Swedish police, or 69 cases per 100,000 population, according to the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (BRÅ), which is an 11% increase from the previous year. In 2015, the number of reported rapes declined 12%, to 5918 (On the other hand, Swedish Crime Survey in 2015 showed that 1.7% of the total population or 129,000 people between 16-79 years old have exposed to some extension of sexual offenses include rape previously in their lives, increased from 1% in 2014.) In 2016, the number of reported rapes increased again to 6,715. The number of convictions has remained relatively unchanged since 2005, with approximately 190 convictions on average each year. The total number of convictions for rape and aggravated rape in Sweden 2015 was 176. The total number of convictions for sexual offences, which includes rape but also less severe crimes such as buying sexual services, was 1160.\n\nIn August 2018 SVT reported that rape statistics in Sweden show that 58% of men convicted of rape and attempted rape over the past five years were born outside of the European Union: Southern Africans, Northern Africans, Arabs, Middle Easterns, and Afghans. Swedish Television's investigating journalists found that in cases where the victims didn't know the attackers, the proportion of foreign-born sex offenders was more than 80%. The number of rapes reported to the authorities in Sweden significantly increased by 10% in 2017, according to latest preliminary figures from the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention. The number of reported rape cases was 73 per 100,000 citizens in 2017, up 24% in the past decade. Official numbers show that the incidence of sexual offences is on the rise; the Swedish Government has declared that young women are facing the greatest risks and that most of the cases go unreported.\n\nThe first statutory law against rape in Sweden dates back to the 13th century. It was considered a serious crime, punishable by death until 1779. The current Swedish Penal Code was adopted in 1962 and enacted on 1 January 1965. A long-standing tradition of gender equality policy and legislation, as well as an established feminist movement, have led to several legislative changes and amendments, greatly expanding the definition of rape. For example, in 1965 Sweden was one of the first countries in the world to criminalise marital rape. Homosexual acts and gender neutrality was first introduced in 1984, and sex with someone by improperly exploiting them while they are unconscious (e.g. due to intoxication or sleep) was included in the definition of rape in 2005.\n\nThis excerpt is an unofficial translation, from the Swedish police website:\n\nIn Sweden, case law also plays an important role in setting precedent on the application of the legislation. For example, a 2008 ruling by the Supreme Court decided that digital penetration of the vagina, on a woman who is intoxicated or sleeping, shall be regarded as an sexual act comparable to sexual intercourse, and is therefore an act of rape.\n\nEver since the collation of crime statistics was initiated by the Council of Europe, Sweden has had the highest number of registered rape offences in Europe by a considerable extent. In 1996, Sweden registered almost three times the average number of rape offences registered in 35 European countries. However, this does not necessarily mean rape is three times as likely to occur as in the rest of Europe, since cross-national comparisons of crime levels based on official crime statistics are problematic, due to a number of factors described below.\n\nThere are three types of factors that determine the outcome of crime statistics: statistical factors, legal factors, and substantive factors. The combined effect of these \"make it safe to contend that the Swedish rape statistics constitute an 'over-reporting' relative to the European average\", according to a study by Hanns von Hofer, Professor of Criminology at Stockholm University, published by The European Journal on Criminal Policy and Research.\n\nUnlike the majority of countries in Europe, crime data in Sweden are collected when the offence in question is first reported, at which point the classification may be unclear. In Sweden, once an act has been registered as rape, it retains this classification in the published crime statistics, even if later investigations indicate that no crime can be proven or if the offence must be given an alternative judicial classification.\n\nSweden also applies a system of expansive offence counts. Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.\n\nIn Sweden, crime statistics refer to the year when the offence was reported; the actual offence may have been committed long before. Swedish rape statistics can thus contain significant time-lag, which makes interpretations of annual changes difficult.\n\nIn 2018, Swedish Television investigative journalism show Uppdrag Granskning analysed the total of 843 district court cases from the five preceding years and found that 58% of all convicted of rape had a foreign background and 40% were born in the Middle East and Africa, with young men from Afghanistan numbering 45 stood out as being the most next most common country of birth after Sweden. When only analysing rape assault (Swedish: \"överfallsvåldtäkt\") cases, that is cases where perpetrator and victim were not previously acquainted, 97 out of 129 were born outside Europe.\n\nThe way the crime itself is defined and various related aspects of the judicial process affect the registration of offences in the official statistics. The concept of rape can be defined narrowly or in a more expansive manner. In Sweden, the definition of rape has been successively widened over the years, leading to an ever-larger number of sexual assaults being classified as rape. For example, in 1992 a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape. This legislative change resulted in about a 25% increase in the level of registered rape offences.\n\nChanges in the legal process has also affected the number of reports. Until 1984, rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges, with an additional restriction of a six months time limit. This resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going unreported.\n\nThe Swedish prosecution system is governed by the principle of legality and the \"equality principle\", which means that as a rule, the police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. This can be assumed to lead to a more frequent registration of offences than in systems with the inverse \"expediency principle\", where the classification of offences is negotiable on the basis of plea bargaining, and the prosecutor has the right not to prosecute, even when a prosecution would be technically possible. English speaking common law countries operate an adversarial system.\n\nWillingness to report crime also affects the statistics. In countries where rape remains associated with a strong taboo and a high level of shame, the propensity to report such offences probably tends to be lower than in countries characterized by a higher level of sexual equality. A police force and judicial system enjoining a high level of confidence and a good reputation with the public will produce a higher propensity to report crime than a police force which is discredited, inspires fear or distrust.\n\nThe findings of the 2000 International Crime Victims Survey (ICVS) indicate that the respondents' satisfaction with the police is above average in Sweden, with almost no experience of corruption. Sweden has also been ranked number one in sexual equality.\n\nWidely differing legal systems, offence definitions, terminological variations, recording practices and statistical conventions makes any cross-national comparison on rape statistics difficult. Large-scale victimisation surveys have been presented as a more reliable indicator.\n\nA frequently cited source when comparing Swedish rape statistics internationally is the regularly published report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2012, according to the report by UNODC, Sweden was quoted as having 66.5 cases of reported rapes per 100,000 population, based on official statistics by Brå. This is the highest number of reported rape of any nation in the report. The high number of reported rapes in Sweden can partly be explained by the comparatively broad definition of rape, the method of which the Swedish police record rapes, a high confidence in the criminal justice system, and an effort by the Government to decrease the number of unreported rapes.\n\nThe UNODC itself discourages any cross-national comparisons based on their reports, because of the differences that exist between legal definitions, methods of offense counting and crime reporting. In 2013, of the 129 countries listed in the UNODC report, a total of 67 countries had no reported data on rape. Some majority-Muslim countries missing data—for example Egypt—classifies rape as assault. A crime survey funded by the UN and published in The Lancet Global Health concluded that almost a quarter of all men admit to rape in parts of Asia. Some of the countries with the highest percentage of men admitting rape in that study, China and Bangladesh for instance, are also not listed or have relatively low numbers of reported rape in the UNODC report.\n\n8 out of 10 of the countries with the highest number of reported rape in the 2011 UNODC report were members of OECD, an organization of high-income economies with a very high Human Development Index. 6 out of 10 countries with the highest number of reported rapes were also in the top of the Global Gender Gap Index rankings.\n\nIn Sweden there is a comparatively broad definition of what constitutes rape. This means that more sexual crimes are registered as rape than in most other countries. For this reason, criminologists tend to recommend crime comparisons between countries based on large surveys of the general public, so-called victim surveys.\n\nThe Swedish Crime Survey (SCS) is a recurrent survey by Brå of the attitudes and experiences of the general population regarding victimization, fear of crime and public confidence in the justice system, with an annual sample size of around 15,000 respondents.\n\nIn its 2018 report, \"Nationella trygghetsundersökningen 2018\" (tr: \"national survey of safety 2018\") the Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention stated that there had been an increase in the self-reported number of victims of sexual crime among from 4.7% in 2016 to 6.4% in 2017. In the 5 preceding years there were escalating levels compared to the 2005–2012 period where the level was relatively stable. The increase in self-reporte victimisation was greater among women than among men. while the number of male victims remained largely constant over the timespan (see graph). The questionnaire pollls for incidents which would equate to attempted sexual assault or rape according to Swedish law.\n\nIn 2009, Amnesty International published a report on rape in the Nordic countries, criticizing the low conviction rates in Sweden, citing previously published estimates from Brå of around 30,000 incidents of rape, with less than 13 percent of the 3,535 rape crimes reported resulting in a decision to start legal proceedings and 216 persons convicted in 2007.\n\nAccording to a London Metropolitan University study in 2009, funded by the European Commission Daphne Programme—primarily focused on attrition, the process by which rape cases fail to proceed through the justice system—Sweden had the highest number of reported rapes in Europe (almost twice that of England and Wales, based on 2002-2007 UNODC figures), that may or may not be attributed to the fact that in 2005 there has been reform in the sex crime legislation. That change in the legislation applies for rapes reported in 2006 and 2007 but it doesn't apply for the previous rapes reported in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005 before the change and when the reported rapes in Sweden were still the highest in Europe. The reform made the legal definition of rape one of the widest legal definitions in the world, but not the lowest conviction rate. Insufficient evidence was the most frequent reason why cases were discontinued before court (53%).\n\nThe authors of the study questioned the accuracy of the data provided by the countries reporting low instances of rape. They also noted that a widening of the definition of rape in law; procedural rules which require police to record all reports, a confidence in the criminal justice system and a greater willingness among Swedish women to report rape in relationships could account for the relative high number of reported rapes in Sweden.\n\nThe low conviction rate could be explained by the reduced legal distinction between rape and permitted intercourse, leading to greater challenges for the prosecution to prove its case, according to Petter Asp, Professor of Criminal Law at Stockholm University.\n\nIn 2013, \"Forskning & Framsteg\" \"(FoF)\", a Swedish popular science magazine, published an article reporting that “The evidence suggests that gang rapes in Sweden is increasing - despite the decline in violent crime in general.” \"FoF\" went on to report that, “The increase, which primarily occurred in the 2000s, may have to do with \"rape with multiple perpetrators\" from 2004, classified as \"serious crime\", which means that more obscure cases fall into this category.” \"FoF\" further reports that “National Council's investigator, Klara Hradilova-Selin, said that \"developments could at least partly be interpreted in terms of an actual increase.\" Although there are a number of other important reasons why we are seeing more reports, such as, Klara Hradilova-Selin goes on to say, “more woman dare to go the police” and an “increased alcohol consumption”. Finally \"FoF\" goes on to report that in the 1990s “In the gang rape of three or more perpetrators 39 percent are foreign born.” The statistics for gang rapes were not investigated by Swedish authorities after 2006.\n\nIn March 2018, newspaper Expressen investigated gang rape court cases from the two preceding years and found that there were 43 men having been convicted. Their average age was 21 and 13 were under the age of 18 when the crime was committed. Of the convicted, 40 out of the 43 were either immigrants (born abroad) or born in Sweden to immigrant parents. Another investigation by newspaper Aftonbladet found that of 112 men and boys convicted for gang rape since July 2012, 82 were born outside Europe. The median age of the victims was 15, while 7 out of 10 perpetrators were between 15 to 20.\n\nAccording to Brå in 2013, it is likely that as many as 80 per cent of all rapes are not reported, which was confirmed in a 2014 study of the extent of violence against women, funded by the Government of Sweden and the Crime Victim Compensation and Support Authority. This can be compared to a 2007 British Government report, estimating that between 75 and 95 percent of rapes are not reported in the United Kingdom.\n\n"}
{"id": "650909", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=650909", "title": "Security printing", "text": "Security printing\n\nSecurity printing is the field of the printing industry that deals with the printing of items such as banknotes, cheques, passports, tamper-evident labels, security tapes, product authentication, stock certificates, postage stamps and identity cards. The main goal of security printing is to prevent forgery, tampering, or counterfeiting. More recently many of the techniques used to protect these high-value documents have become more available to commercial printers whether they are using the more traditional offset and flexographic presses or the newer digital platforms. Businesses are protecting their lesser-value documents such as transcripts, coupons and prescription pads by incorporating some of the features listed below to ensure that they cannot be forged or that alteration of the data cannot occur undetected.\n\nA number of technical methods are used in the security printing industry.\n\nMost banknotes are made of heavy paper, almost always from cotton fibres for strength and durability, in some cases linen or speciality coloured or forensic fibres are added to give the paper added individuality and protect against counterfeiting. Some countries, including Canada, Nigeria, Romania, Mexico, New Zealand, Israel, Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom and Australia, produce polymer (plastic) banknotes, to improve longevity and allow the inclusion of a small transparent window (a few millimeters in size) as a security feature that is difficult to reproduce using common counterfeiting techniques.\n\nA watermark is a recognizable image or pattern in paper that appears lighter or darker than surrounding paper when viewed with a light from behind the paper, due to paper density variations. A watermark is made by impressing a water coated metal stamp or dandy roll onto the paper during manufacturing. Watermarks were first introduced in Bologna, Italy in 1282; as well as their use in security printing, they have also been used by papermakers to identify their product. Watermarks can also be made on polymer currency, for example, Australia has its coat of arms watermarked on all its plastic bills.\n\nPrinted with white ink, simulated watermarks have a different reflectance than the base paper and can be seen at an angle. Because the ink is white, it cannot be photocopied or scanned.\n\nIntaglio is a printing technique in which the image is incised into a surface. Normally, copper or zinc plates are used, and the incisions are created by etching or engraving the image, but one may also use mezzotint. In printing, the surface is covered in ink, and then rubbed vigorously with tarlatan cloth or newspaper to remove the ink from the surface, leaving it in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top, and the plate and paper are run through a printing press that, through pressure, transfers the ink to the paper.\n\nThe very sharp printing obtained from the intaglio process is hard to imitate by other means. Intaglio also allows for the creation of latent images which are only visible when the document is viewed at a very shallow angle.\n\nA guilloché is an ornamental pattern formed of two or more curved bands that interlace to repeat a circular design. They are made with a geometric lathe.\n\nThis involves the use of extremely small text, and is most often used on currency and bank checks. The text is generally small enough to be indiscernible to the naked eye. Cheques, for example, use microprint as the signature line.\n\nColor changing inks are made from mica.\n\nColor changing inks colored magnetizable inks are prepared by including chromatic pigments of high color strength. The magnetic pigments’ strong inherent color generally reduces the spectrum of achievable shades. Generally, pigments should be used at high concentrations to ensure that sufficient magnetizable material is applied even in thin offset coats. Some magnetic pigment are best suited for colored magnetizable inks due to their lower blackness.\nHomogenous magnetization (no preferred orientation) is easily obtained on pigment made of spherical particles. Best results are achieved when remanence and coercive field strength are very low and the saturating magnetization is high.\n\nMagnetic pigments are also used in ribbon inks for coding and reading (MICR = Magnetic Ink Character Recognition).\nThe pigment is dispersed in a binder system (resin, solvent) or a wax compound and applied either by pressing or by hot melt to a carrier film (usually polyethylene).\n\nWhen pearlescent pigments are viewed at different angles the angle of the light as it's perceived makes the color appear to change as the magnetic fields within the particles shift direction.\n\nA hologram may be embedded either via hot-stamping foil, wherein an extremely thin layer of only a few micrometers of depth is bonded into the paper or a plastic substrate by means of a hot-melt adhesive (called a size coat) and heat from a metal die, or it may be directly embossed as holographic paper, or onto the laminate of a card itself.\nWhen incorporated with a custom design pattern or logo, hologram hot stamping foils become security foils that protect credit cards, passports, bank notes and value documents from counterfeiting. Holograms help in curtailing forging, and duplication of products hence are very essential for security purposes. Once stamped on a product, they cannot be removed or forged, enhancing the product at the same time. Also from a security perspective, if stamped, a hologram is a superior security device as it is virtually impossible to remove from its substrate.\n\nMetal threads and foils, from simple iridescent features to foil color copying to foils with additional optically variable effects are often used.\n\nThere are two kinds of security threads. One is a thin aluminum coated and partly de-metalized polyester film thread with microprinting which is embedded in the security paper as banknote or passport paper. The other kind of security thread is the single or multicolor sewing thread made from cotton or synthetic fibers, mostly UV fluorescent, for the bookbinding of passport booklets.\n\nOn occasion, the banknote designers succumb to the Titanic effect (excess belief in the latest technology), and place too much faith in some particular trick. An example is the forgery of British banknotes in the 1990s. British banknotes in the 1990s featured a metal strip through the paper about 1 mm wide that comes to the paper surface every 8 mm. When examined in reflected light, it appears to have a dotted metallic line running across it, but when viewed through transmitted light, the metal strip is dark and solid.\n\nDuplicating this was thought to be difficult, but a criminal gang was able to reproduce it quickly. They used a cheap hot-stamping process to lay down a metal strip on the surface of the paper, then printed a pattern of solid bars over it using white ink to leave the expected metal pattern visible. At their trial, they were found to have forged tens of millions of pounds’ worth of notes over a period of years.\n\nBecause of the speed with which they can be read by computer systems, magnetic ink character recognition is used extensively in banking, primarily for personal checks. The ink used in magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) technology is also used to greatly reduce errors in automated (or computerized) reading.\n\nSome people believe that the magnetic ink was intended as a fraud prevention concept, yet the original intent was to have a non-optical technology so that writing on the cheque, like signatures, would not interfere with reading. The main magnetic fonts (E13-B and CMC7) are downloadable for a small fee and in addition magnetic toner is available for many printers. Some higher resolution toners have sufficient magnetic properties for magnetic reading to be successful without special toner.\n\nSerial numbers help make legitimate documents easier to track and audit. To help detect forgeries serial numbers will normally have a Check digit to verify the serial number.\n\nAnother method of protection is to create trap numbers within the serial number range. For example, the system may automatically invalidate numbers which are in a range of 200-300 (e.g. 210, 205 would be invalid). The system may even take single random numbers within a block (e.g. ending in 51, 37, 48 within a 200-300 range would be invalid).\n\nIn the late twentieth century advances in computer and photocopy technology made it possible for people without sophisticated training to easily copy currency. In an attempt to prevent this, banks have sought to add filtering features to the software and hardware available to the public that senses features of currency, and then locks out the reproduction of any material with these marks. One known example of such a system is the EURion constellation.\n\nSometimes only the original document has value. An original signed cheque for example has value but a photocopy of it does not. An original prescription script can be filled but a photocopy of it should not be. Copy-evident technologies provide security to hard copy documents by helping distinguish between the original document and the copy.\n\nThe most common technology to help differentiate originals from copies is the void pantograph. Void pantographs are essentially invisible to the untrained, naked eye on an original but when scanned or copied the layout of lines, dots and dashes will reveal a word (frequently VOID and hence the name) or symbol that clearly allows the copy to be identified. This technology is available on both traditional presses (offset and flexographic) and on the newer digital platforms. The advantage of a digital press is that in a single pass through the printer a void pantograph with all the variable data can be printed on plain paper.\n\nCopy-evident paper, sometimes marketed as ‘security paper’, is pre-printed void pantograph paper that was usually produced on an offset or flexographic press. The quality of the void pantograph is usually quite good because it was produced on a press with a very high resolution and when only a small number of originals are to be printed it can be a cost effective solution however the advent of the digital printer has rapidly eroded this benefit.\n\nA second technology which complements and enhances the effectiveness of the void pantograph is the Verification Grid. This technology is visible on the original, usually as fine lines or symbols but when photocopied these lines and images disappear; the inverse reaction of the void pantograph. The most common examples of this technology are on the fine lines at the edge of a cheque which will disappear when copied or on a coupon when a symbol, such as a shopping cart, disappears when an unauthorized copy is made. Verification Grid is available for either traditional or digital presses.\n\nTogether the void pantograph and the Verification Grid complement each other because the reactions to copying are inverse, resulting in a higher degree of assurance that a hard copy document is an original.\n\nThe use of color can greatly assist the prevention of forgeries. By including a color on a document a color photocopier must be used in the attempt to make a copy however the use of these machines also tends to enhance the effectiveness of other technologies such as Void Pantographs and Verification Grids (see Copy-evident above).\n\nBy using two or more colors in the background and blending them together a prismatic effect can be created. This can be done on either a traditional or a digital press. When a document using this technique is attempted to be photocopied the scanning and re-creation by a color copier is inexact usually resulting in banding or blotching and thereby immediate recognition of the document as being a copy.\n\nA frequent example of prismatic coloring is on checks where it is combined with other techniques such as the Void Pantograph to increase the difficulty of successful counterfeiting.\n\nCarefully created images can be hidden in the background or in a picture on a document. These images cannot be seen without the help of an inexpensive lens of a specific line screening. When placed over the location of the image and rotated the image becomes visible. If the document is photocopied the Halo image is lost.\n\nHalo can be printed on traditional or digital presses. The advantage of traditional presses is that multiple images can be overlaid in the same location and become visible in turn as the lens is rotated.\n\nHalo is used as a technique to authenticate the originality of the document and may be used to verify critical information within the document. For example, the value of a coupon might be encoded as a Halo image that could be verified at the time of redemption or similarly the seat number on a sporting event ticket.\n\nFalse-positive testing derives its name because the testing requires both a false and a positive reaction to authenticate a document. The most common instance is the widely available counterfeit detector marker seen in many banks and stores.\n\nCounterfeit detector markers use a chemical interaction with the substrate, usually paper, of a document turning it a particular color. Usually a marker turns newsprint black and leaves currency or specially treated areas on a document clear or gold. The reaction and coloring varies depending upon the formulation. Banknotes, being a specially treated substrate, usually behave differently than standard newsprint or other paper and this difference is how counterfeits are detected by the markers.\n\nFalse-positive testing can also be done on documents other than currencies as a means to test their authenticity. With the stroke of a marker a symbol, word or value can be revealed that will allow the user to quickly verify the document, such as a coupon. In more advanced applications the marker creates a barcode which can be scanned for verification or reference to other data within the document resulting in a higher degree of assurance of authenticity.\n\nPhotocopied documents will lack the special treating of the substrate so are easily detectable. False-positive testing generally is a one time test because once done the results remain visible so while useful as part of a coupon this technique is not suitable for ID badges for example.\n\nFluorescent dyes are dyes which fluoresce under ultraviolet light or other unusual lighting. These show up as words, patterns or pictures and may be visible or invisible under normal lighting. This feature is also incorporated into many banknotes and other documents - e.g. Northern Ireland NHS prescriptions show a picture of local '8th wonder' the Giant's Causeway in UV light. Some producers include multi-frequency fluorescence, such that different elements fluoresce under specific frequencies of light.\n\nBanknotes are typically printed with fine alignment between the printing on each side of the note. This allows the note to be examined for this feature, and provides opportunities to unambiguously align other features of the note to the printing. Again, this is difficult to imitate accurately enough in most print shops.\n\nWith the advent of RFID, it is possible to insert extremely small RF-active devices into the printed product to enhance document security. This is most apparent in modern biometric passports, where an RFID chip mirrors the printed information.\n\nSecurity ink with a normal \"trigger\" temperature of , which will either disappear or change colors when the ink is rubbed, usually by the fingertips.\n\nPressure-sensitive or hot stamped labels characterized with a normal (gray or colored) appearance. When viewed via a special filter (such as a polarizer) an additional, normally latent, image appears.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24559988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24559988", "title": "Sextortion", "text": "Sextortion\n\nSextortion is a form of sexual exploitation that employs non-physical forms of coercion to extort sexual favors from the victim. Sextortion refers to the broad category of sexual exploitation in which abuse of power is the means of coercion, as well as to the category of sexual exploitation in which threatened release of sexual images or information is the means of coercion.\n\nAs used to describe an abuse of power, sextortion is a form of corruption in which people entrusted with power – such as government officials, judges, educators, law enforcement personnel, and employers – seek to extort sexual favors in exchange for something within their authority to grant or withhold. Examples of such abuses of power include: government officials who request sexual favors to obtain licenses or permits, teachers who trade good grades for sex with students, and employers who make providing sexual favors a condition of obtaining a job.\n\nSextortion also refers to a form of blackmail in which sexual information or images are used to extort sexual favors from the victim. Social media and text messages are often the source of the sexual material and the threatened means of sharing it with others. An example of this type of sextortion is where people are extorted with a nude image of themselves they shared on the Internet through sexting. They are later coerced into performing sexual acts with the person doing the extorting or are coerced into posing or performing sexually on camera, thus producing hardcore pornography.\n\nA video highlighting the dangers of sextortion has been released by the National Crime Agency in the UK to educate people, especially given the fact that blackmail of a sexual nature may cause humiliation to a sufficient extent to cause the victim to take their own life, in addition to other efforts to educate the public on the risks of sextortion.\n\nSextortion via the use of webcams is also a concern, especially for those who use webcams for flirting and cybersex. Often this involves a cybercriminal posing as someone else – such as an attractive person – initiating communication of a sexual nature with the victim (about 95% of victims are male). Often, the cybercriminal simply shows a pre-recorded video of a performer from a cybersex webcam site which they are sufficiently familiar with to message the victim at points in the video where the performer appears to be typing on the keyboard, to give the illusion to the victim that it is actually the performer in the video messaging them. The victim is then persuaded to undress in front of a webcam, and may also be persuaded to engage in sexual behaviour, such as masturbation. The video is recorded by the cybercriminal, who then reveals their true intent and demands money or other services (such as more explicit images of the victim, in cases of online predation), threatening to publicly release the video to video services like YouTube and send it to family members and friends of the victim if they do not comply. Sometimes threats to make false allegations of paedophilia against the victim are made as well. This is known as webcam blackmail. An increase in webcam blackmails have been reported, and it affects both young and old, male and female alike. Webcam blackmail is also connected with webcam trolling.\n\nAn early use of the term appears in print in 1950 in California.\n\nSince early 2009, The Institute for Responsible Online and Cell-Phone Communication (iroc2.org) began warning the public about the trend of \"Sextortion\" via live events and websites including www.sextortion.org. This is a trend that grew based on the birth and growth of the trend known as \"sexting\" whereby compromising images and videos were being shared by individuals without a real understanding of the short and long term consequences of sharing \"private' content on digital tools designed for sharing.\n\nIn 2009, the International Association of Women Judges (IAWJ), in partnership with the Association of Women Judges in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Philippine Women Judges Association, and the Tanzania Women Judges Association, and with funding from the Government of the Netherlands, launched a three-year program on \"Stopping the Abuse of Power through Sexual Exploitation: Naming, Shaming, and Ending Sextortion.\" Presentations on sextortion were made to judges attending the 2010 and 2012 Biennial World Conferences of the IAWJ and to NGOs attending the 2011 and 2012 meetings of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.\n\nThere are also scientific studies describing the prevalence of sextortion in Europe, etc. in the Czech Republic (2017).\n\nIncidents of sextortion have been prosecuted under various criminal statutes, including as extortion, bribery, breach of trust, corruption, sexual coercion, sexual exploitation, sexual assault, child pornography, and computer hacking and wiretapping.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37032089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37032089", "title": "Sinai insurgency", "text": "Sinai insurgency\n\nThe Sinai insurgency is an ongoing conflict in the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt, between Islamist militants and Egyptian security forces, which has included attacks on civilians. The insurgency began after the start of the Egyptian Crisis, which saw the overthrow of longtime Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak in the Egyptian revolution of 2011.\n\nThe Sinai insurgency initially consisted of militants, largely composed of local Bedouin tribesmen, who exploited the chaotic situation in Egypt and weakened central authority to launch a series of attacks on government forces in Sinai. In 2014, elements of the Ansar Bait al-Maqdis group pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and proclaimed themselves Sinai Province, and a part of ISIL. Security officials say militants based in Libya have established ties with the Sinai Province group and have blamed the porous border and ongoing civil war for the increase in sophisticated weapons available to the Islamist groups.\n\nThe Egyptian authorities have attempted to restore their presence in the Sinai through both political and military measures. Egypt launched two military operations, known as Operation Eagle in mid-2011 and then Operation Sinai in mid-2012. In May 2013, following an abduction of Egyptian officers, violence in the Sinai surged once again. Following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état, which resulted in the ousting of Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi, \"unprecedented clashes\" have occurred.\n\nThe fallout suffered by the locals as a result of the insurgency in Sinai ranges from militant operations and the state of insecurity to extensive military operations and the demolishing of hundreds of homes and evacuating thousands of residents as Egyptian troops pressed on to build a buffer zone meant to halt the smuggling of weapons and militants from and to the Gaza strip. A report, compiled by a delegation from the state-funded National Council for Human Rights (NCHR), stated that most of the displaced families share the same grievances of palpable government negligence, unavailability of nearby schools for their sons and the lack of health services. Since the start of the conflict, dozens of civilians were killed either in military operations or kidnapped and then beheaded by militants. In November 2017, more than 300 Sufist worshippers were killed and over 100 injured in an attack on a mosque west of the city of Al-Arish.\n\nSufism was previously dominant in the region before militant jihadi ideas began to take hold. The Sinai peninsula has long been known for its lawlessness, having historically served as a smuggling route for weapons and supplies. Security provisions in the Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty of 1979 have institutionalized a diminished security presence in the area, enabling militants to operate with a freer hand. Moreover, the limited government-directed investment and development in Sinai has discriminated against the local Bedouin population, a population that values tribal allegiance over all else. The combination of Sinai's harsh terrain and lack of resources have kept the area poor and hence ripe for militancy.\n\nFollowing the January 2011 uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak's regime, the country became increasingly destabilized, creating a security vacuum in the Sinai peninsula. Radical Islamic elements in Sinai exploited the opportunity, using the unique environment, in launching several waves of attacks upon Egyptian military and commercial facilities.\n\nAccording to \"The Economist\", the conflict also involves local armed Bedouin \"who have long-standing grievances against the central government in Cairo\" and that \"they are barred from joining the army or police; they find it hard to get jobs in tourism; and they complain that many of their lands have been taken from them\".\n\nSince the 2011 uprising against the Mubarak regime in Egypt, there has been increasing instability in the Sinai Peninsula. In addition the collapse of the Libyan regime increased the quantity and sophistication of weapons being smuggled into the area. The situation provided local Bedouin with an opportunity to assert their authority, leading to clashes with Egyptian security forces, but the cause of violence soon transitioned to salafi jihadism. Hard-line militant Muslims used Sinai as a launch-point for attacks against Israel and turned on the Egyptian state., focusing on Egypt's security establishment and the Sinai's Arab Gas Pipeline.\n\nIn August 2011, Operation Eagle was launched, in an effort to restore law and order, driving Islamist insurgents and criminal gangs out of North Sinai's urban centers. As well as, attempting to sever the link between militant groups in the Sinai and Gaza, by augmenting its control over the Gaza border crossing.\n\nThe operation had limited success, and a week into the operation, Salafi jihadists carried out the biggest cross-border attack on Israel in the post-Mubarak period.\n\nOn 5 August 2012, an attack on the Rafah barracks shook the Egyptian military and population. Only a month into his term, President Mohamed Morsi sacked the longstanding defence minister and promoted General al Sisi to take his place. Operation Sinai was launched, aimed at eliminating armed Islamist groups, protecting the Suez Canal, and destroying the tunnel network connecting the Sinai with the Gaza Strip. During the operation, 32 militants and suspects were killed and 38 arrested, while 2 civilians had been killed by early September 2012.\n\nSince the July 2013 coup, against President Mohamed Morsi, a Muslim Brotherhood leader, the Egyptian military and security services in particular have been targeted by Sinai-based violent Islamist groups. In an increase in violence security forces came under near daily attack throughout July to August 2013.\n\nIn 2013, the new authorities adopted a more aggressive strategy, leading to mass arrests and hard security measures.\nOver the few months leading to 2014, the Egyptian army gained the upper hand in the battle against militias that have found safe haven in the peninsula. After isolating and largely clearing the populated northeastern Sinai, the army put many militant factions on the defensive, most notably Ansar Bait al-Maqdis. However, one thousand armed militiamen are still sheltering in the main stronghold in Jabal Halal, as well as Jabal Amer area.\n\nIn November 2014, the situation in the Sinai was thrust into the spotlight with deadliest attack on the security forces since 2011, and the group responsible Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis pledging allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province.\nIn the wake of the attack on the security forces, the government declared state of emergency, imposing a curfew and establish a buffer zone in the Sinai's border area with Gaza.\n\nOn May 2013, a number of Egyptian Army police officers were taken hostage by armed tribesmen in the Sinai peninsula, with their videos released on the internet begging for their lives. As a response, Egypt's government had built up security forces in northern Sinai as part of an effort to secure the release of six policemen and a border guard kidnapped by suspected militants. On 20–21 May, Egyptian troops and police, backed by helicopter gunships, conducted a sweep through a number of villages in northern Sinai, along the border with Israel. The officials said the forces came under fire from gunmen in vehicles, triggering the clashes. The clashes left one gunman dead by 21 May. The hostages were released on 22 May after talks between the captors and Bedouins. One suspect in the kidnapping was arrested on 30 May 2013.\n\nSince President Mohamed Morsi's ouster on 3 July by Sisi, there has been an increase in violence by armed Bedouin and Islamists. Attacks on security forces have been witnessed almost daily since his ouster — leading many to link the militants there to the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group from which Morsi hails.\n\nIn response, Egypt launched a major military operation in Sinai against the militants, bringing in two additional battalions.\n\nIn the two weeks following 3 July 39 terrorist attacks occurred in North Sinai. In the resulting clashes between armed groups and security forces, 52 gunmen and civilians and six security personnel died. On 15 July, witnessed the highest civilian casualties, when a bus transporting workers to the army-operated Al-Arish Cement Company was attacked. Five were killed and 15 were wounded. On 16 July, attacks resulted in some of the most intense army engagement, concentrated at Al-Masa'id, Al-Joura, and the Central Security camp at Al-Ahrash.\n\nSecurity operations have been largely confined to the 40-kilometre area between Al-Arish and Sheikh Zuweid, extending northward toward Rafah along the border with Israel and up to the Karam Abu Salem crossing. Fighting intensifies between the gunmen and the joint army-police forces at night. The frequency of attacks has varied from two to five in a single day. In addition, targets have expanded from fixed security checkpoints to mobile patrols. In most operations, the gunmen use four-wheel drive vehicles and combinations of light and heavy weaponry. However, in three recent attacks RPG-7 launchers were used, most likely smuggled from Libya. The G-7 grenade is capable of penetrating armoured vehicles and is generally fired at the doors.\n\nOn 27 July, operation dubbed \"Desert Storm\" was launched by the Egyptian army in North Sinai Governorate and will last for 48 hours. Two of Egypt's field armies, as well as the country's Air Force and Navy are reportedly taking part in this large-scale operation. The military are said to be blocking all the roads, bridges and tunnels leading from Northern Sinai to other provinces of Egypt.\n\nA bomb was placed at a hotel frequented by security officials on 2 August 2013, though it caused no injuries. A security source told the Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm that a majority of \"terrorists\" had been arrested as of 3 August 2013. 2 mausoleums were bombed on 4 August 2013, though no injuries resulted.\n\nTwenty-five Egyptian policemen died in an attack in the northern region of Sinai, on 18 August. After militants forced two mini-buses carrying off-duty policemen to stop, ordered the policemen out and forced them to lie on the ground before shooting them. The Egyptian military arrested eleven people, including five Hamas members, three local residents and three foreign nationals, for their alleged involvement in the killings. The person who committed the murders confessed on 1 September 2013.\n\nMilitary spokesperson Ahmed Ali said that Egyptian security forces recent operations in Sinai, from 5 July to 23 August, resulted in: 78 suspected militants killed, including 32 foreigners; 116 people injured; and 203 people arrested, including 48 foreigners, for their alleged involvement in attacks on security checkpoints in the peninsula. Additionally 343 tunnels on the border between Egypt and Gaza at Rafah have been destroyed.\n\nOn 3 September, fifteen Islamist militants were killed in an attack by military helicopters.\n\nOn 7 September, the Egyptian army launched a new operation in the region. The operation involved tanks and at least six Apache helicopters. The army have been jamming communications to thwart militant coordination. The army combed through areas near the Gaza Strip, including locations used by militants suspect in the killing and abduction of Egyptian soldiers over the past year. In the three days of operations, since 7 September, one officer, two soldiers and 29 militants were killed, and 39 militants were arrested.\n\nOn 11 September, suicide bomber targeted Egyptian military intelligence headquarters in Rafah, bringing down the structure, at the same time a car bomb had rammed an army checkpoint. In the simultaneous attack at least nine soldiers were killed.\n\nOn 24 December 16 were killed and over 134 injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura, in the worst attack on a government site since the ouster of Morsi in July. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis, a Sinai-based group, claimed responsibility for the attack. The group deemed Egyptian troops infidels because they answer to a \"secular government\", warning them to desert or face death.\n\nOn 26 January, militants shot down an army Mi-17 helicopter in North Sinai, killing all five of its crew members. The weapon the insurgents used was an infrared-homing, surface-to-air missile from the Russian-made Igla family. This was the first time in Egyptian history that an armed nonstate actor dropped a state's military helicopter by a missile. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for this attack as well as series of escalating attacks on police and soldiers.<ref name=\"NYT-26/01/14\"></ref> Earlier that morning masked men in an SUV attacked a bus carrying soldiers in Sinai, killing at least three and injuring at least 11.\n\nOn 3 February, in what was described as the biggest operation in the Egyptian army's ongoing offensive against militants in the Sinai, 30 suspected militants were killed and another 15 injured in a series of airstrikes and another 16 were arrested.\n\nOn 16 February 2014, a bomb exploded on or under a tour bus of a South Korean church group in the Egyptian city of Taba, which borders the Gulf of Aqaba and Eilat, Israel. The bombing killed 4 people – 3 South Koreans and the Egyptian bus driver – and injured 17 others. According to \"The New York Times\", the bombing could \"offer worrying new evidence that militants who have been attacking Egypt's security forces for months were broadening their campaign against civilians.\"\n\nOn 24 October 2014, 31 army and police soldiers were killed in two separate attacks in North Sinai. The attack was the largest ever since the start of the war on terror in Sinai. As a result of the attack, president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi declared a state of emergency in the governorate after meeting with the National Defence Council for several hours. The state of emergency was to last for three months and to include a daily curfew from 5pm to 7am until further notice.\n\nOn 10 November 2014, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) forming the Sinai Province group with a confusingly similar name to two Egyptian regional governments.\n\nOn 14 November 2014, ISIL published a video online that included footage of the group carrying out the October 2014 Sinai attacks.\n\nDuring 2015, the intensity and the scale of insurgent attacks expanded.\n\nOn 12 January 2015, Sinai Province kidnapped a police officer while traveling in North Sinai and took him to an unknown location. On the following day on 13 January 2015, Egyptian military spokesperson announced the discovery of the dead body of the officer after launching a search operation. He also said that during the operation 10 militants were killed, while two others were arrested.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, Sinai Province published a video online that included the kidnapping and execution of the police officer kidnapped on 12 January.\n\nOn 29 January 2015, militants from the Sinai Province militant group launched a series of attacks on army and police bases in Arish using car bombs and mortars.

On the same day, a separate attack on a police station in Arish resulted in the death of 5 policemen and 1 civilian. The attack on the station was carried out by a suicide bomber using a bomb-laden vehicle. Militant group Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis has claimed responsibility for the attacks.\n\nOn 27 April 2015, members from Al-Tarabin tribe in North Sinai launched an attack on Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis positions in Rafah. The attack came after Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis gunmen fatally shot a member of Al-Tarabin tribe in Berth village in southern Rafah, North Sinai, after he refused to take their warning statements ordering them not to deal with the Egyptian military.\n\nOn 16 May 2015, three Egyptian judges and their driver were killed when gunmen opened fire on their vehicle in North Sinai.

The attack also targeted Sheikh Zuweid police station. Reinforcements from the Second Army Zone stationed in Ismailia have been deployed to Sheikh Zuweid, and F-16 fighter jets were spotted targeting militants in the city. Militants have reportedly killed several civilians who refused to allow them onto their rooftops to target security forces. An army statement claimed the killing of more than 100 militants from the attacking force. The militant death toll increased in the following days, due to Egyptian military operations in the region, reaching 241 killed.\n\nOn 4 July 2015, a shell bomb struck a house in Sheikh Zuweid, killing a woman and her two children.

Three Egyptian soldiers were also killed.\n\nAccording to Reuters, as of 2013, Ansar Bait al-Maqdis was in control of about a third of the villages in Sinai. Now, daily clashes with militants in North Sinai are reported by the army. The insurgency has not spread to south Sinai, where there are tourist hubs. In the northeastern part of the peninsula, checkpoints have often been established by militants as the army lack the power to stop them. The militants have captured and assassinated policemen there.\n\nOn 24 December 2013, sixteen people were killed and over a hundred people injured in a huge bomb which hit the Daqahliya Security Directorate in Mansoura. Ansar Bait al-Maqdis claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nOn 5 August 2014, 5 policemen were killed in an attack on a police car on Matrouh road by armed militants.\n\nOn 28 November 2014, the militant group Sinai Province claimed responsibility for the killing of 2 army personnel in Cairo and Qaliubiya.\n\nOn 1 December 2014, Sinai Province claimed responsibility for killing a United States citizen in Egypt's western desert in August 2014.\n\nOn 21 December 2014, the Egyptian police raided an Ansar Beit Al-Maqdis cell in the Nile Delta killing 5 members.\n\nOn 26 December 2014, two Ansar Bait al-Maqdis militants were killed in a gunfight in El-Salam City, on the eastern outskirts of Cairo. The Ministry of Interior later identified one of the dead militants as the commander of Ansar Beit El-Maqdis in the Nile Delta.\n\nOn 11 July 2015, a car-bomb exploded near the Italian consulate in Cairo, killing one person and injuring nine others. None of the Italian staff of the consulate were injured as the establishment was still closed at the time of the explosion. Later, the Islamic State has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nOut of the approximately 15 main militant groups operating in the Sinai desert, the most dominant and active militant groups have close relations with the Gaza Strip. The Army of Islam, a U.S. designated terrorist organization based in the Gaza Strip, is responsible for training and supplying many militant organizations and jihadist members in Sinai. Mohammed Dormosh, the Army of Islam's leader, is known for his close relationships to the Hamas leadership. The Army of Islam smuggles members into the Gaza Strip for training, then returns them to the Sinai Peninsula to engage in terrorist and jihadist activities.\n\nThe disposition of Egyptian forces in the Sinai peninsula is mandated by the Camp David Accords and monitored by the 1,600 foreign troops that make up the Multinational Force and Observers. Egypt is permitted only enough military forces in the Sinai to enforce security.\n\nIn 2011, Egypt sent an additional 2,500 troops and 250 armored personnel, with helicopters as part of Operation Eagle, a mission to provide security during the power transition from then-recently fallen Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Operation Eagle was joined by Operation Sinai in 2012, which came in response to a militant attack against an Egyptian border post 5 August that killed 16 border guards. Together, the two operations increased the total troop count by more than 2,500 added 80 vehicles and at least two attack helicopters. Egypt also was allowed to deploy armed fighter jets to El Arish to assist its ground forces in Sinai.\n\nEgypt's expanded force structure in Sinai is designed to deny militants sanctuary by bringing more force to bear than the municipal police alone can provide. Many of the new forces are stationed in the northeast of Sinai along the Egyptian border with Gaza. Setting up roadblocks and checkpoints to monitor and inspect traffic transiting the Sinai Peninsula to counter this smuggling.\n\nIn the October 2014 attacks, for the first time the militants in Sinai used suicide truck bombs to breach army roadblocks and strongpoints, then followed them with an infantry attack.\n\nAfter the October attacks, the Egyptian military began using armed drones for the first time since the Sinai insurgency began. And as a measure to counter weapon and militant trafficking between Egypt and Gaza strip, the Egyptian government announced the creation of a buffer zone along the Egypt-Gaza border.\n\nFollowing the attacks on army and police bases in Arish in early 2015, the Egyptian President issued a decree to create a unified military command for the east of the Suez Canal to combat terrorism. Led by General Osama Roshdy Askar, it will guide counter-terrorism activities of the Second and Third army.\n\nOn 27 April 2015, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree ordering the isolation and evacuation of new areas in North Sinai's Rafah city, thus expanding the buffer zone.\n\nA shift in the militants strategy appeared in the July 2015 clashes. Zack Gold, Middle East analyst, views the battle as a change in strategy from hit and run tactics toward an ISIL-like 'holding' of territory.\n\nAs an effort to limit car-bombs attacks, Egypt's Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab issued a decree banning 4X4 vehicles in army-operations zones in Sinai.\n\nThe Egyptian government has used the death penalty to punish those convicted of committing terrorist acts in Sinai. On 26 December 2017, Egypt hanged 15 men convicted of killing nine soldiers during an attack on a military checkpoint in 2013.\n\nOn 16 October 2017, the Islamic State announced that it had fired rockets at Eshkol region in Israel, in response to 'Jewish aircraft' assisting Egyptian security forces.\n\nOn 23 May 2018, the Islamic State released a video claiming that Israeli aircraft struck civilian homes in the Sinai and showed Hebrew labels on munitions purportedly found in aftermath of the attack.\n\nOn 2 February 2018, Lebanese Al Akhbar reported that in the last several months, Israel had struck targets of the Islamic State in Sinai, including Palestinians who after abandoing the group's strongholds in Syria and Iraq, joined the offshoot in Sinai. As a result of the airstrikes, more around 20 militants of the group were killed.\n\nIn the two years since 2011, Israel has approved two Egyptian military increases in the Sinai Peninsula above levels set in the Camp David Accords, which mandates that the Sinai must remain demilitarized, with only enough forces in Sinai to enforce security. Israel did so because it is not in its interest to have unrest in Sinai, whether political protests or militant violence.\n\nHowever, in late 2012, concern began to be raised as Egypt began deploying more force and tanks without coordination from Israel. On 21 August, Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that it is important for Israel to make sure that the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty is upheld, and not to remain silent as Egyptian military forces enter the Sinai. Concern was raised by Israeli officials over Egyptian failure to notify Israel about the deployment of tanks in the Sinai, which violates the peace treaty. Lieberman said, \"We must make sure that every detail is upheld, otherwise we'll find ourselves in a slippery slope as far as the peace treaty is concerned.\"\n\nOn the same day, Israeli daily \"Maariv\" reported that Israel sent a message to Egypt via the White House, protesting Egypt's ongoing increase in military presence in the Sinai without coordination from Israel, and telling Egypt that it must remove tanks from the Sinai because their presence violates the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of 1979, which states that Sinai Peninsula is to remain demilitarized. The \"Maariv\" report was echoed by an article in \"The New York Times\", which stated that Israel was \"troubled\" by the entry of Egyptian tanks into the northern Sinai Peninsula without coordination with Israel and had asked Egypt to withdraw them. Partly due to Egypt's military deploying tanks in the Sinai Peninsula, Israel is increasingly worried about what has long been their most critical regional relationship. The lack of coordination around their deployment is seen as potentially undermining a peace treaty that has been a cornerstone of Israel's security for decades according to the New York Times. Israel is also concerned that Egypt may use Operation Eagle to build up its military presence in the Sinai, and leave the tanks and armored carriers in the Sinai while not doing much more than symbolic action to eliminate the terrorist threat.\n\nIsrael has not issued a formal complaint, and instead prefers to resolve the issue through quiet contacts, as well as mediation from the U.S., to avoid straining its relationship with Egypt.\n\nOn 24 August 2012, a senior Egyptian military source said that Egyptian Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak have reached an agreement on the issue of the militarization of the Sinai. \"Al Hayat\" reported that Sissi phoned Barak and said that Egypt was committed to maintaining the peace treaty with Israel. Sissi also said that the militarization was temporary, and was needed for security and to fight terrorism. However, an Israeli defense official denied that such a conversation took place.\n\nIn late August 2012, Morsi said that the security operations do not threaten anyone, and \"there should not be any kind of international or regional concerns at all from the presence of Egyptian security forces\". Morsi added that the campaign was in \"full respect to international treaties. The Egyptian-Israeli peace deal places limits on Egyptian military deployment in the Sinai. Officials in Israel were concerned about Egypt building up heavy armour in Sinai.\n\nOn 8 September 2012, an Israeli official confirmed that coordination exists between Israel and Egypt regarding Operation Eagle. Egyptian Military spokesman Ahmed Mohammed Ali had earlier announced that Egypt has been consulting with Israel regarding its security measures in the Sinai.\n\nOn 2 July 2015, one day after the attacks on 15 Egyptian Army checkpoints, Israel announced that it was giving Egypt a \"free hand to operate in northern Sinai against local jihadist groups, voluntarily ignoring an annex to the 1979 Camp David Peace Accords banning the presence of significant Egyptian forces in the area.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent condolences to Egypt for the terrorist attacks that rocked that country on 1 July. He further stated that \"we are together with Egypt and many other states in the Middle East and the world in the struggle against extreme Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nAccording to CNN, in a move to increase security in the Sinai, help Morsi, and reassure Israel, U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta offered Egypt classified intelligence-sharing capabilities to help Egypt identify military threats in the area, which he discussed during his recent trips to Egypt and Israel. The technology has been widely used in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify vehicles at great distances. The technology may also be used by the Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai. The United States is also offering increased intelligence sharing, including satellite imagery and drone flights, as well as cellphone intercepts and other communications among militants suspected of plotting attacks.\n\nOn 22 August 2012, the State Department urged Egypt to be transparent over Operation Eagle and any security operations in the Sinai. The State Department said that the United States supports Operation Eagle against terrorism, but stressed that Egypt must continue coordination with Israel regarding these operations and military increases in the Sinai, according to the 1979 Camp David Accords. The State Department also called on Egypt to fulfill its obligations under the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and deal strongly with security threats in the Sinai, while ensuring that \"lines of communication stay open.\"\n\nOn 23 August 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking with Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Kamel Amr, urged Amr to maintain lines of communication with Israel, and emphasized the importance of being transparent over the militarization of the Sinai.\n\nThe Multinational Force and Observers in Sinai, a 1,650-strong international organization created in 1979 during the Camp David Accords with peacekeeping responsibilities, kept a low profile during the intensification of Operation Eagle in 2012. A representative for the organization said that \"we are unable to respond to queries from the media at this time\" in response to whether Egypt asked permission to move weaponry into the Sinai, and whether Israel granted it.\n\nThe Egyptian pipeline carrying natural gas to Jordan has been attacked at least 15 times since the start of the uprising in early 2011. The lack of Egyptian gas hit Jordan budget severely (by JD 1.4 billion or the equivalent of USD 2 billion yearly for the past two years) and they are looking for Egypt to compensate for the lost quantities.\n\nA \"Mada Masr\" journalist questioned the accuracy of Interior Ministry reports on at least two accusations. CBS journalist Clarissa Ward went undercover into the Sinai and witnessed evidence of a scorched earth policy.\n\n\n"}

In this short time, the festival became one of the biggest music events in Yugoslavia. Skopjefest was the place where famous Macedonian singers such as Slave Dimitrov, Zafir Hadzimanov, Nina Spirova made their performances together with eminent Yugoslav performers. Audiences enjoyed over 50 songs.\n\nAfter Macedonia gained its independence peacefully from Yugoslavia, SkopjeFest was revived in 1994, and has since taken over from MakFest as Macedonia's premier music festival.\n\nThe show involves some of Macedonia's finest performers, singing original tracks submitted to MRT (Makedonska Radio Televizija), usually accompanied by the orchestra of MRT (excluding some of its latest editions).\n\nIt has also been used as the Macedonian national selections for the Eurovision Song Contest, since the late 1990s. The first Macedonian representative in Eurovision, was Macedonian singer Vlado Janevski who won SkopjeFest 1998 with the song \"Ne Zori Zoro\", for the Eurovision Song Contest 1998. This was Macedonia's first participation in the Eurovision Song Contest. Ever since, SkopjeFest has been shadowed by many controversial debates regarding the strategies behind the song selections and the lack of transparence concerning the winner. Such allegations are not new to this contest. However, they intensified as the Eurovision participation became a factor. After the decision to make SkopjeFest the National Pre-Selection round for Macedonia's representative to Eurovision, the traditional point award ceremony was eliminated and replaced by the controversial announcement of only the Top 3 places. Neither the points of the jury nor the televoting results are made public.\n\nUp until 2002, SkopjeFest used to be the biggest musical activity in the country. However, it faced financial problems. In 2003, the festival wasn't held in order to save money for the next year when Macedonia was going to particate in the Eurovision Song Contest. In the meantime, MRT made new criteria for the national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, the festival returned in 2004 only to celebrate the 60th anniversary of MRT. After that, financial problems increased and it wasn't organised until 2008, again as an ESC national final.\n\nAfter the first details about selecting the Macedonian participant for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 were revealed, it was announced that Skopje Fest will continue being held as an independent event without being involved in the Macedonian selection process for the Eurovision Song Contest. On 15 July 2014, it was announced that Skopje Fest will return as the Macedonian national final for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015.\n"}

{"id": "37066421", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37066421", "title": "Theatre Royal, Manchester", "text": "Theatre Royal, Manchester\n\nThe Theatre Royal in Manchester, England, opened in 1845. Situated next to the Free Trade Hall, it is the oldest surviving theatre in Manchester. It was commissioned by Mancunian businessman John Knowles who wanted a theatre venue in the city.\n\nThe Theatre Royal operated as a theatre from 1845 until 1921, when it closed in the face of growing competition from the Palace Theatre and Opera House. The building has since been converted numerous times for use as a cinema, bingo hall and nightclub. It has been unoccupied since 2009.\n\nThe theatre, which stands on an island site on the south side of Peter Street, is constructed in sandstone ashlar. It is in two storeys, with an attic, and is in Neoclassical style. Around the building, between the upper storey and the attic, is a modillioned cornice. Its entrance front facing Peter Street is symmetrical with three bays, the central bay being wider than the lateral bays. The central bay is in the form of a portico, with Corinthian columns and pilasters. Its entablature contains a central semicircular arch breaking through to the gable. Steps lead up to entrances in each bay. Above the central entrance is a pedimented niche containing a statue of William Shakespeare, which is based on the statue by Peter Scheemakers in Westminster Abbey. The lateral bays contain windows with balconies in the upper storey. Along the sides of the theatre are alternating rectangular windows and panels, with a blank semicircular arch above each window. The interior of the theatre has been altered, but retains its 1875 gallery. The theatre was designated as a Grade II listed building on 3 October 1974. The authors of the \"Buildings of England\" series describe it as a \"splendid classical composition in stone, one of the best examples of theatre architecture surviving anywhere in England from the first half of the 19th century\". The Theatres Trust described it as \"unique and architecturally significant\", with the façade being \"one of the finest examples of theatre architecture to have survived in Britain from the first half of the nineteenth century\", stating that it influenced the design of the Royal Opera House, London.\n\nManchester appears to have two previous Theatre Royals before the current building was constructed in 1845. The first opened in Spring Gardens on 5 June 1775 and operated on that site until the expiration of the proprietors' lease in 1807.\n\nThe second Theatre Royal opened in Fountain Street on 12 July 1807 and was destroyed by fire on 7 March 1844. John Knowles took over the management of this second Theatre Royal some time before the fire, at a time when the theatre in Manchester was at its lowest ebb. Knowles set up a strong stock company and proved himself a very capable, though somewhat authoritarian, theatre manager. However, following the 1844 fire the proprietors of the theatre in Fountain Street refused to rebuild it.\n\nAt a public dinner in his honour in July 1844, Knowles was presented a plate \"in acknowledgement of his energetic and successful efforts to revive national drama in Manchester\". Knowles told the gathering that if they could get no one else to build a theatre then he would do it himself. As a result, Knowles bought the patent rights and set about finding a site for the new theatre. Knowles had always been an admirer of theatrical performances and he was anxious to see their renovation in this, his native town. He desired to see the revival of the legitimate drama, and the plays represented in a manner duly worthy of them.\nKnowles found a new site for his theatre on Peter Street. He demolished the Wellington Inn and Brogden's Horse Bazaar. Knowles employed Francis Chester and John Gould Irwin as the architects for his new theatre. In preparation for the building of the new Theatre Royal, Knowles and Chester went to London and visited most of the metropolitan theatres, noting their areas, internal forms, acoustic capabilities, etc. With a cost of £23,000, the new Theatre Royal opened to an audience of 2,500. Precautionary measures against fire were taken by placing a tank on the roof capable of holding 20,000 gallons of water, which was connected by pipes to the stage and the green room. Its programme that night included Weber's \"Oberon\" overture, Douglas Jerrold's \"Time works wonders\" and an elaborate ballet spectacle \"The Court Ball in 1740\". Knowles's schedule of productions was intensive – in one season there were 157 performances at which two and sometimes three plays were performed. The popularity of the theatre grew. Charles Dickens, John Leech and George Cruickshank were amongst notable people who appeared at the theatre. The theatre was dedicated to Shakespeare and Knowles installed a Carrara marble statue of the playwright above the entrance. It was Manchester's finest outdoor statue. In 1875, after years of success, Knowles severed his connections with the theatre, disposing of it to a limited company for £50,000.\n\nIn 1921 the theatre was converted to a cinema due to competition from the Palace Theatre, Manchester and the Manchester Opera House. In 1972 the theatre became a bingo hall, then a nightclub in 1978, at which point various lighting bridges and rigs were added. It was known successively as the \"Discotheque Royale\", Infinity then M2 and finally a rename and rebrand to Coliseum due to the trouble caused by the clientele it attracted. The nightclub closed in 2009.\n\nIn 2008 a 28-storey office and retail tower was proposed, called \"Theatre Royal Tower\", that would be connected to the back of the original theatre. It was designed by Stephenson Bell with The Benmore Group as the developer.\n\nIt was announced in 2011 by owners Benmore that the Theatre Royal would receive a £2 million refurbishment to convert the building into a live music venue. Plans to convert the building into a hotel and live music venue never came about.\n\nDespite the promise of investment, Benmore sold the building in November 2012. It was purchased by the Edwardian Group, who owned the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel adjacent to the theatre in the Free Trade Hall. The building could potentially be restored as a theatre or banqueting hall as a complimentary extension for the hotel.\n\nThe 1845 exterior façade is virtually intact, and the building retains the balcony from 1875. Theatres Trust has said that the internal conversions for its past usage in various guises appear to have obscured – rather than destroyed  – the interior. The Trust classify the original interior work as \"restorable as a theatre\".\n\n\nNotes\nBibliography\n"}

The show was the final of three Triplemanía II shows held in 1994, preceded by Triplemanía II-A in April and Triplemanía II-B held 12 days prior. 1994 was the first year AAA held multiple Triplemanía shows in a year, a tradition they would continue through 1997, after which Triplemanía became a single annual event. The annual Triplemanía show(s) are AAA's biggest show of the year, serving as the culmination of major storylines and feature wrestlers from all over the world competing in what has been described as AAA's version of WrestleMania or their Super Bowl event. The May 27th show was the fourth overall show produced under the Triplemanía banner.\n\nThe main event match was the culmination of a storyline that AAA had been building for a year, starting at the previous year's Triplemanía I show. Portraying the archetypes of \"good\" and \"evil' AAA had created a storyine where the \"hero\" Konnan sought revenge against the \"villain\" Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts. The two faced off in a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match, which is considered the ultimate \"feud settler\" in \"Lucha Libre\". For the match both competitors bet their hair on the outcome of the match, with the loser being subjected to the humiliation of being shaved bald in the center of the ring. The show also featured a steel cage match between \"Los Hermanos Dinamita\" (Spanish for \"The Dynamite Brothers\"; Cien Caras, Máscara Año 2000 and Universo 2000) fighting \"Los Payasos\" (\"The Clowns\"; Coco Rojo, Coco Verde and Coco Amarillo) in a rematch from Triplemanía II-A where \"Los Payasos\" won the Mexican National Trios Championship from \"Los Hermanos Dinamita\". The show was also supposed to feature a match for the Mexican National Middleweight Championship but the reigning champion Octagón was not medically cleared to wrestle.\n\nAAA founder Antonio Peña had originally envisioned the Triplemanía series as three shows held over the summer, but for the first year AAA only held 1 show, Triplemanía I. In 1994 AAA announced that they would hold three Triplemanía shows, building the storylines into its climax at the third and final Triplemanía II show. The first show, Triplemanía II-A , took place in the outdoor baseball stadium in Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes on April 26, the second show, Triplemanía II-B, was held at the Estadio Olímpico Benito Juárez in Zapopan, Jalisco on May 15 and the third and final Triplemanía II show, Triplemanía II-C, would happen at the \"El Toro\" bullfighting arena in Tijuana, Baja California on May 27, 1994.\nThe Triplemanía show featured eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe main event match would be the conclusion of the main storyline of AAA at the time as Peña and the AAA officials had spent over a year laying out the storyline between Konnan and Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts. The foundation of the story began a year prior to Triplemanía II-C, at the first ever Triplemanía I, held on April 30, 1993. To start the storyline Roberts was given a spot in the front row, presented as if he had bought a ticket on his own and was just there to watch the show. The main event was a \"Retirement match\" between Konnan and Cien Caras where the loser would be forced to retire, which saw Jake Roberts become involved in the match, arguing with Konnan during the second fall and actually distracted him enough to get counted out. With the loss Konnan was forced to retire and due to his actions Roberts became the top \"rudo\" of AAA as he was seen as directly responsible for the popular Konnan being forced to retire. For several months AAA booked Roberts in only special appearances, not actually wrestling but making appearances to remind people of what he did to Konnan. After about four months Konnan returned to AAA and together with Peña supposedly petitioned the Mexico City boxing and wrestling commission to get Konnan reinstated. The storyline explanation given was that he was allowed to return to wrestling due to Roberts' interference in the match. AAA built their August 28, 1993 \"La Revencha\" show in the Los Angeles Sports Arena around Konnan finally getting in the ring with Robets, in a three-way elimination match that also included Cien Caras. Konnan forced Cien Caras to submit, gaining a measure of revenge from their Triplemanía match. Later on Jake \"the Snake\" Roberts got himself disqualified when \"Los Gringos Locos\" (Eddy Guerrero and Love Machine) interfered in the match. On November 12, 1993 Jake Roberts and \"Los Gringos Locos\" defeated Konnan, Blue Panther and Perro Aguayo in the main event of AAA\"s \"La Lucha del Honor\" event at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. During the match Roberts pinned Konnan in both the second and the third fall.\n\nPart of Peña booking strategy was to not have the two rivals fight one-on-one right away, building the anticipation to when they finally get in the ring for their first singles match. Roberts kept the advantage, using his partnership with \"Los Gringos Locos\" to have the numbers advantage. AAA kept the two apart until March 12, 1994 where the two finally faced off. They met in a steel cage match to even the numbers in the main event of AAA's spring Los Angeles Sports Arena show. During the show Konnan finally gained a measure of revenge on Roberts, winning the match by climbing out of the cage, but still had not pinned Roberts. The loss to Konnan was used as the impetus to Roberts finally agreeing to put his hair on the line in a \"Lucha de Apuesta\", or \"bet match\", which was the ultimate end game for the storyline. The match was scheduled to be the main event of the third Triplemanía II show, with a preview of it taking place at Triplemanía II-B where Konnan, Perro Aguayo and Cien Caras defeated Jake Roberts, Love Machine and Miguel Pérez Jr. in the main event.\n\nThe fifth match of the night, a match that was supposed to see Octagón defend his Mexican National Middleweight Championship against Blue Panther. A few days prior to the match Octagón was involved in a car accident, suffering a hand injury. The wrestling boxing commission could not medically clear Octagón to wrestle on the show. Instead he came to the ring with the championship and handed it over to Blue Panther via forfeit, only asking for a rematch once he had recovered from his injury.\n\nRoberts would remain with AAA for several months after losing all his hair, he ended up turning on \"Los Gringos Locos\" and actually teamed up with Konnan only a few months later. defeating the team of Perro Aguayo and Vampiro. The \"Los Gringos Locos\" storyline carried AAA into their subsequent major shows \"Night of Champions\" and later on their first ever pay-per-view (PPV) AAA When Worlds Collide that was driven by the feud between \"a Pareja del Terror\" (Eddy Guerrero and Love Machine) facing off against El Hijo del Santo and Octagón in a \"Luchas de Apuestas\" match where Guerrero and Love Machine ended up losing their hair. 19 days afterwards Love Machine, real name Art Barr, dies of unknown causes. The popularity of Konnan in the wake of his victory over Jake Robers made his turn to the \"rudo\" side months later ever more shocking, with Konnan attacking his longtime friend Perro Aguayo during a match and joining \"Los Gringos Locos\" instead. At \"When Worlds Collide\" Aguayo defeated Konnan in a steel cage match.\n\nOnce Octagón had recovered from his hand injury he received a rematch for the championship he never lost in the ring, but on August 4, 1994 Blue Panther successfully defended the title against Octagón.\n\nJohn Molinario, who writes about wrestling for the Canadian Online Explorer, described the show as a \"booking masterpiece by Pena\" and that it established Antonio Peña as \"the best booker in the business.\" Wrestling commentator Mike Tenay, who was in attendance that night, recalled \"the great heat for that main event match\".\n\n"}

After American forces accidentally opened fire on their own men, a cover-up was attempted. A plot element of the movie \"Courage Under Fire\" was based on this particular incident.\n\nIn the predawn hours of February 27, 1991, an armored personnel carrier of the 1st Armored Division broke down near the airfield of Umm Hajul. The five operators of the vehicle, U.S. Army engineers, found themselves stranded in the desert when M1A1 tank and Bradley Fighting Vehicle units of the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment approached from the north. Specialist Craig Walker tried signaling to the approaching forces by switching his night vision goggles on and off. The armored cavalry troop had been told the airfield was defended by 500+ Iraqi soldiers, and to expect stiff resistance. The troop commander fired warning shots in the air after requesting permission to do so from his squadron commander. Some of the cavalry troopers saw returned fire, but whether this came from the engineers is doubtful. The cavalry troop vehicles opened fire on the engineers with high-explosive rounds, mistaking their vehicle for an enemy position. The result of the high-explosive rounds set off demolition charges within the engineers' armored personnel carrier. The situation progressed for about seven minutes, with the troop commander calling cease fire after two volleys, thinking the \"enemy forces\" were contained and waiting for them to surrender. The squadron commander then arrived on the scene in his Bradley Fighting Vehicle and opened fire when he thought one of the engineers (still believed to be Iraqis) was trying to escape. When the shooting was over, one engineer was wounded and another, Corporal Lance Fielder of Tennessee, was dead from coaxial machinegun fire.\n\nShortly after the incident, false reports were filed, stating that the 3rd Cavalry took an estimated 50 Iraqi prisoners in the assault. Three Bronze Stars were awarded on the basis of misleading statements and representations, as well. The squadron commander was the son-in-law of a famous Vietnam-era general, and his brothers-in-law were also general officers. He did not face repercussions and was selected for promotion to colonel. Both the cavalry troop commander and the lieutenant in charge of the engineers at the airfield were given career-ending evaluations and forced out of the Army. This was particularly ironic, since the lieutenant was completely not culpable. Many discrepancies uncovered in three army investigations were overlooked or ignored, and several lower-ranking soldiers and officers were threatened or coerced into remaining silent.\n\nU.S. Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee initiated a Congressional investigation into this incident, in which Corporal Lance Fielder of Nashville, Tennessee had died. The investigation resulted in the forced retirement of the squadron commander of the unit that fired shots at Fielder and others, his reduction in rank to major, and revocation of medals.\n\n"}

This was considered the birth of these events, which would begin to be called of this way on the next year.\n\nAfter the Youth Jubilee celebrated in Rome the year before on the occasion of the Holy Year, Pope John Paul II organized a youth gathering for Palm Sunday in 1985 coinciding with the International Youth Year proclaimed by the UN.\n\nBefore the young people arrived in Rome, the Pope issued on December 8, 1984, a message for the World Day of Peace devoted to the young. Then John Paul II invited the youth to Palm Sunday to Rome for the World Youth Meeting. The Pope chose Palm Sunday as the date of the meeting because in the previous year, just on Palm Sunday, the Catholic Church celebrated the Jubilee of the Youth, celebrated on the occasion of the Holy Year 1983/1984 (1950 anniversary of the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ).\n\nThe Pope met the young Catholics for the first time in Archbasilica of St. John Lateran at 5:00 pm. The slogan of this great meeting were the words: May you know how to realize the hope that is in you (1 Peter 3:15).\n\nDuring this meeting the apostolic letter \"To the young people of the world\", written by the Pope for the occasion, was presented firstly to those present. During the following night, there was the possibility for young people to watch in eucharistic adoration at some churches in the city.\n\nThe following morning, starting at 6:00 WYJ participants formed three parades, which joined at Via della Conciliazione to reach St. Peter's Square together - where the final mass would be celebrated.The sources attest in the morning the presence of about 250,000/ 300,000 \npeople from 70 countries, mostly Italians; but there were about twenty thousand Spaniards and five thousand pilgrims from Eastern European countries (primarily Poland, Yugoslavia and Hungary). Young people from Alaska, Lebanon were also present in Rome, as also from Africa and the Far East. Also noteworthy are the presence of other Christian confessions (especially English Protestants), and even non-Christians (including four hundred Japanese Buddhists).\n\nAlthough it is not a real WYJ (it is considered a sort of \"zero edition\"), this meeting has some traits that will characterize all future international events of WYD: for example, participants are given a \"pilgrim's bag\" and a cap with the logo of the day; for hospitality to pilgrims a network of accommodation facilities in the area is activated; an anthem is composed for the occasion.\n\nThe song \"Resta qui com noi\" by the musical group Gen Rosso (texts by V. Ciprì and music by B. Enderle) was composed for the gathering and inaugurated the tradition of adopting an official anthem for each World Youth Day.\n\nGiven the success of the day, the Pope on next December 20 officially proclaimed the establishment of the World Youth Days, which will be held every year in all the dioceses of the world on Palm Sunday (in 1986 it would be called the alternation on two-year cycle diocesan editions and world editions in a city selected by the\nPontifical Council for the Laity).\nJohn Paul II after World Youth Meeting in Rome decided to announce World Youth Day in 1986.\n"}
