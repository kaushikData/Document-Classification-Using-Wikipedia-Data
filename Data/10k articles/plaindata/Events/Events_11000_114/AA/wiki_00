This form of animal deception is an adaptive behavior also known as tonic immobility or thanatosis. Apparent death can be used as a defense mechanism or as a form of aggressive mimicry, and occurs in a wide range of animals.\n\nWhen induced by humans, the state is sometimes colloquially known as animal hypnosis. According to Gilman et al., the investigation of \"animal hypnosis\" dates back to the year 1646 in a report by Athanasius Kircher.\n\nTonic immobility (TI) is a behaviour in which some animals become apparently temporarily paralysed and unresponsive to external stimuli. In most cases, this occurs in response to an extreme threat such as being captured by a (perceived) predator, although in sharks exhibiting the behaviour, some scientists relate it to mating, arguing that biting by the male immobilizes the female and thus facilitates mating.\n\nDespite appearances, the animal remains conscious throughout tonic immobility. Evidence for this includes the occasional responsive movement, scanning of the environment and animals in TI often taking advantage of escape opportunities.\n\nSome sharks can be induced into tonic immobility by inverting them and restraining them by hand, e.g. dogfish sharks, lemon sharks, whitetip reef sharks. For tiger sharks (measuring 3–4 metres in length), tonic immobility can be induced by humans placing their hands lightly on the sides of the animal's snout in the area surrounding the eyes. During tonic immobility in sharks, the dorsal fins straighten, and both breathing and muscle contractions become more steady and relaxed. This state persists for an average of 15 minutes before recovery and the resumption of active behaviour. Scientists have exploited this response to study shark behaviour; chemical shark repellent has been studied to test its effectiveness and to more accurately estimate dose sizes, concentrations and time to recovery. Tonic immobility can also be used as a form of mild anesthesia during experimental manipulations of sharks.\n\nScientists also believe that tonic immobility can be a stressful experience for sharks. By measuring blood chemistry samples when the shark is immobile, it has been suggested that tonic immobility can actually put stress on the shark, and reduce breathing efficiency. However, it has also been proposed that sharks have a series of compensatory mechanisms that work to increase respiration rates and lower stress.\n\nIt has been observed that orcas can exploit sharks' tonic immobility to prey on large sharks. Some orcas ram sharks from the side to stun them, then flip the sharks to induce tonic immobility and keep them in such state for sustained time. For some sharks, this prevents water from flowing through their gills and the result can be fatal.\n\nGoldfish, trout, rudd, tench, brown bullhead, medaka, paradise fish, and topminnow have been reported to go limp when they are restrained on their backs. Oscars seem to go into shock when they are stressed (when their aquarium is being cleaned, for example): they lie on their side, stop moving their fins, start to breathe more slowly and deeply, and lose colour. A similar behavior has been reported for convict tangs in the field.\n\nIn 1997, it was reported that around the Farallon Islands off the coast of California, a female orca was seen apparently inducing tonic immobility in a great white shark. The orca held the shark upside down to induce TI and kept the shark still for 15 minutes, causing it to suffocate to death. This was the first recorded case of predation on a great white shark in the wild by a species other than humans.\n\nAnother case of orcas apparently inducing TI has been observed with stingrays in New Zealand. In this context, the orcas turn themselves upside down before attacking, trap the stingrays in their mouths then quickly right themselves. This inverts the stingray, thereby inducing TI, rendering the fish helpless and an easy meal.\n\nTonic immobility can be reliably induced in iguanas by a combination of inversion, restraint and moderate pressure. During TI, there are obvious changes in respiration including a decline in respiration rate, the rhythm becomes sporadic, and the magnitude irregular. The prolonged period of TI does not seem to be consistent with the fear hypothesis, but could be the result of a period of cortical depression due to increased brain stem activity.\n\nTonic immobility can also be induced in the Carolina anole. The characteristics of this TI vary as a function of the duration and condition of captivity.\n\nIn rabbits, the physiological and behavioral responses to induced tonic immobility have been found to be indicative of a fear-motivated stress state. Tonic immobility is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. A 2006 study concluded that rabbits show symptoms that are in line with being stressed after being in a tonic immobility state, such as a faster heart rate and breathing. This confirms that the promotion of tonic immobility to increase a bond between rabbits and their owners – holding the rabbit on its back and thinking the rabbits enjoy it – is misplaced; however, the researchers concluded that inducing tonic immobility in rabbits is appropriate for certain veterinary procedures, as it holds less risk than anesthesia.\n\nTonic immobility has been hypothesized to occur in humans undergoing intense trauma, including sexual assault. While \"freezing\" in response to life-threatening situations is well-known, the common \"freeze\" response exhibited by victims of rape is often misunderstood as passive consent.\n\nThere is also an increasing body of evidence that points to a positive contribution of tonic immobility in human functioning. Thus, defensive immobilization is hypothesized to have played a critical role in the evolution of human parent-child attachment, sustained attention and suggestibility, REM sleepand theory of mind.\n\nTonic immobility is considered to be a fear-potentiated response induced by physical restraint and characterised by reduced responsiveness to external stimulation. It has been used as a measure in the assessment of animal welfare, particularly hens, since 1970. The rationale for the TI test is that the experimenter simulates a predator thereby eliciting the anti-predator response. The precept is that the prey animal 'pretends' to be dead to be able to escape when/if the predator relaxes its concentration. Death-feigning birds often take advantage of escape opportunities; TI in quail reduces the probability of the birds being predated by cats.\n\nTo induce tonic immobility, the animal is gently restrained on its side or back for a period of time, e.g. 15 seconds. This is done either on a firm, flat surface or sometimes in a purpose-built ‘V’- or ‘U’-shaped restraining cradle. In rodents, the response is sometimes induced by additionally pinching or attaching a clamp to the skin at the nape of the neck. Scientists record behaviours such as the number of inductions (15-second restraining periods) required for the animal to remain still, the latency to the first major movements (often cycling motions of the legs), latency to first head or eye movements and the duration of immobility, sometimes called the ‘righting time’.\n\nTonic immobility has been used to show that hens in cages are more fearful than those in pens, hens on the top tier of tiered battery cages are more fearful than those on the lower levels, hens carried by hand are more fearful than hens carried on a mechanical conveyor, and hens undergoing longer transportation times are more fearful than those undergoing transport of a shorter duration.\n\nTonic immobility as a scientific tool has also been used with mice, gerbils, guinea pigs, rats, rabbits and pigs.\n\nIn animal behaviour, thanatosis (from the Greek noun , meaning \"putting to death\"; \"cf. \": Thanatos) is the process by which an animal feigns death in order to evade unwelcome attention. It can be for various reasons, such as that of a prey evading a predator, a male trying to mate with a female, or a predator trying to lure potential prey closer. The French biologist Georges Pasteur classifies it as a form of \"self-mimesis\", a form of camouflage or mimicry in which the \"mimic\" imitates itself in a dead state.\n\nFor defensive purposes, thanatosis hinges on the pursuer's becoming unresponsive to its victim, as most predators only catch live prey.\n\nIn beetles, artificial selection experiments have shown that there is heritable variation for length of death-feigning. Those selected for longer death-feigning durations are at a selective advantage to those at shorter durations when a predator is introduced, which suggests that thanatosis is indeed adaptive.\n\nIn the hog-nosed snake, a threatened individual rolls onto its back and appears to be dead when threatened by a predator, while a foul-smelling, volatile fluid oozes from its body. Predators, such as cats, then lose interest in the snake, which both looks and smells dead. One reason for their loss of interest is that rotten-smelling animals are avoided as a precaution against infectious disease, so the snake is, in this case, exploiting that reaction. Newly hatched young also instinctively show this behaviour when rats try to eat them.\n\nIn mammals, the Virginia opossum is perhaps the best known example of defensive thanatosis. \"Playing possum\" is an idiomatic phrase which means \"pretending to be dead\". It comes from a characteristic of the Virginia opossum, which is famous for pretending to be dead when threatened. This instinct does not always pay off in the modern world; for example, opossums scavenging roadkill may use it in response to the threat posed by oncoming traffic, and subsequently end up as roadkill themselves.\n\nThe usual advice for humans attempting to survive an attack by a brown bear is to lie face down, cover the face with ones hands/arms/elbows, and 'play dead'; hopefully the bear will get bored and wander away after a while.\n\n\"Playing possum\" can also mean simply pretending to be injured, unconscious, asleep, or otherwise vulnerable, often to lure an opponent into a vulnerable position him or herself.\n\nThanatosis has also been observed in some invertebrates such as the wasp \"Nasonia vitripennis\", and the cricket, \"Gryllus bimaculatus\".\n\nIn the spider species \"Pisaura mirabilis\", male spiders often stage elaborate rituals of gift-giving and thanatosis to avoid getting eaten by female spiders during mating. Studies have shown higher chances of success in mating with females for males who exhibit death-feigning more frequently than for males who do it less.\n\n\"Nimbochromis\" (sleeper cichlids), endemic to Lake Malawi in East Africa, are large predatory fish for whom thanatosis is a form of aggressive mimicry. This fish will lie down on its side on the bottom sediments and assume a blotchy coloration. Scavengers, attracted to what seems like a dead fish, will approach the predator to investigate. \"N. livingstoni\" then abandons the pretense, righting itself again and quickly eating any scavenger unfortunate enough to come too close. A similar strategy has also been observed in the African cichlid \"Lamprologus lemairii\" from Lake Tanganyika and in the Central American yellowjacket cichlid \"Parachromis friedrichsthalii\".\n\n"}

The word \"basse\" describes the nature of the dance, in which partners move quietly and gracefully in a slow gliding or walking motion without leaving the floor, while in livelier dances both feet left the floor in jumps or leaps. The basse danse was a precursor of the pavane as a dignified processional dance . The term may apply to the dance or the music alone.\n\nThe earliest record of a basse danse is found in an Occitan poem of the 1320s by Raimon de Cornet, who notes that the \"joglars\" performed them.\n\nThe \"bassa danza\" is described in the dance treatise of Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro, in northern Italy towards the end of the 15th century, and by his friend Antonio Cornazzano, for whom it was the queen of all dance measures, low dance to be contrasted with the \"alta danza\", the \"high\" or leaping dance called the \"saltarello\". In Germany it became the \"Hofdantz\" .\n\nThoinot Arbeau used the basse danse to explain his method of dance notation in his \"Orchésographie\" (1589). The dance was danced until 1725 but was extinguished soon after by the \"high\" dance technique of ballet \n\nThe general measure of the basse danse was elaborated into different named sequences of steps and movements . The basic measure is counted in sixes but, like the later courante, often combines and time, using hemiola to divide the six as 3–3 or as 2–2–2. This rhythm matches the basic steps of the dance. Most basse danse music is in binary form with each section repeated .\n\nThe basse danse was often followed by a tourdion, due to their contrasting tempi, and these were danced and composed in pairs \"en suite\" like the \"pavane and galliard\" and the \"allemande and courante\" (; ).\n\nEarly music consisted of songs based on a tenor cantus firmus and the length of the choreography was often derived from the verse of the \"chanson\". In performance 3 or 4 instrumentalists would improvise the polyphony based on this tenor. In others multiple parts were written, though choice of instrumentation was left to the performers.\n\nMost famous, perhaps, are the basses danses assembled in 1530 by Pierre Attaingnant in the \"Attaingnant Dance Prints\", which were for four voices, typically improvised upon by adding melodic embellishment (Attaingnant rarely wrote ornamentation, though he did in \"Pavin of Albart\", an embellishment on \"Pavane 'Si je m'en vois'\") .\n\nA treatise in the Royal Library of Belgium in Brussels gives us information about the elements of basse danse and the choreography of specific examples. The basse danse is based upon four steps: \"pas simple\", \"pas double\", \"démarche\" (also known as the \"reprise\") and \"branle\".\n\n\nThe \"révérence\", occurring typically before or after the choreography, is a bow or curtsey that takes place over the course of one measure.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2507217", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2507217", "title": "Chimes at Midnight", "text": "Chimes at Midnight\n\nChimes at Midnight (onscreen title and UK title: Falstaff (Chimes at Midnight), Spanish release: Campanadas a medianoche), is a 1965 English-language Spanish-Swiss period comedy-drama film directed by and starring Orson Welles. The film's plot centres on William Shakespeare's recurring character Sir John Falstaff and the father-son relationship he has with Prince Hal, who must choose between loyalty to his father, King Henry IV, or Falstaff.\n\nWelles said that the core of the film's story was \"the betrayal of friendship.\" It stars Welles as Falstaff, Keith Baxter as Prince Hal, John Gielgud as Henry IV, Jeanne Moreau as Doll Tearsheet and Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly. The script contains text from five of Shakespeare's plays; primarily \"Henry IV, Part 1\" and \"Henry IV, Part 2\", but also \"Richard II\" and \"Henry V\", as well as some dialogue from \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\". Ralph Richardson's narration is taken from the works of chronicler Raphael Holinshed.\n\nWelles had previously produced a Broadway stage adaptation of nine Shakespeare plays called \"Five Kings\" in 1939. In 1960, he revived this project in Ireland as \"Chimes at Midnight\", which was his final on-stage performance. Neither of these plays were successful, but Welles considered portraying Falstaff to be his life's ambition and turned the project into a film. In order to get initial financing, Welles lied to producer Emiliano Piedra about intending to make a version of \"Treasure Island\", and keeping the film funded during its production was a constant struggle. Welles shot \"Chimes at Midnight\" throughout Spain between 1964 and 1965; it premiered at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, winning two awards there.\n\nInitially dismissed by most film critics, \"Chimes at Midnight\" is now regarded as one of Welles' highest achievements, and Welles himself called it his best work. Welles felt a strong connection to the character of Falstaff and called him \"Shakespeare's greatest creation\". Some film scholars and Welles' collaborators have made comparisons between Falstaff and Welles, while others see a resemblance between Falstaff and Welles' father. Disputes over the ownership of \"Chimes at Midnight\" made it difficult to view the film legally until recently. It was released in the UK on DVD and Blu-ray in 2015. A new restoration by Janus Films and The Criterion Collection was screened at the Film Forum in New York January 1–12, 2016. The Criterion Collection released the film on Blu-ray and DVD on August 30, 2016.\n\nThe film opens with Sir John Falstaff and Justice Shallow walking through the snow, then to a warm fire inside the Boar's Head Tavern, as the two reminisce. After a main credit sequence, the narrator explains that King Henry IV of England has succeeded Richard II, whom he has killed. Richard II's true heir, Edmund Mortimer, is a prisoner in Wales, and Mortimer's cousins Northumberland, Worcester, and Northumberland's son Hotspur demand that Henry rescue Mortimer. The king refuses, and thus Mortimer's cousins begin to plot Henry's overthrow.\n\nTo Henry's great dissatisfaction, his son Prince Hal spends most of his time at the Boar's Head Tavern, drinking and carousing with prostitutes, thieves and other criminals under John Falstaff's patriarchal influence. Falstaff insists that he and Hal should think of themselves as gentlemen, but Hal warns Falstaff that he will one day reject both this lifestyle and Falstaff. The next morning Hal, Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto, and Poins disguise themselves in Gadshill to prepare to rob a group of traveling pilgrims. After Falstaff, Bardolph, and Peto rob the pilgrims, Hal and Poins jump out in disguises and take the stolen treasure from Falstaff as a joke.\n\nBack at the Boar's Head Tavern, Falstaff begins to tell Hal and Poins with increasing exaggeration the story of how the money was stolen from him. Hal and Poins poke holes in Falstaff's tale until they reveal their joke to the entire group. In celebration of the newly recovered stolen treasure, Falstaff and Hal take turns impersonating Henry, with a cooking pot crown and vocal impressions. Falstaff's Henry chastises Hal for spending his time with common criminals, but names Sir John Falstaff as his one virtuous friend. Hal's Henry calls Falstaff a \"misleader of youth\".\n\nHal visits the King at the castle and Henry scolds him for his criminal and unethical life-style. Henry warns Hal about Hotspur's growing army and its threat to his crown. Hal passionately vows to his unimpressed father that he will defend Henry and redeem his good name. The King's army, including Falstaff, parades through the streets and off to war. Before the battle, Henry meets with Worcester and offers to forgive all of Hotspur's men of treason if they surrender immediately. Hal vows to personally kill Hotspur. Worcester returns to his camp and lies to Hotspur, telling him that Henry intends to execute all traitors.\n\nThe two armies meet in the Battle of Shrewsbury, but Falstaff hides in shrubs for most of the conflict. After a long and bloody fight, the King's men win the battle, after which Hotspur and Hal meet alone and duel; as Falstaff watches, Hal kills Hotspur. Henry sentences Worcester to death and takes his men as prisoners. Falstaff brings Hotspur's body to Henry, claiming that he killed Hotspur; Henry does not believe Falstaff, instead looking disapprovingly at Hal and the ignoble company he keeps.\n\nThe narrator explains that all of Henry IV's rebellious enemies had been killed by 1408, but that Henry's health has begun to deteriorate. At the castle, Henry becomes upset when told that Hal is once again spending time with Falstaff, and collapses. Hal visits the castle and discovers that Henry is sicker than he had realized. Hal vows to Henry to be a good and noble king. Henry finally has faith in Hal and advises him on how to be a king. Henry dies and Hal tells his men that he is now King Henry V.\n\nFalstaff, Shallow and Silence sit in front of a warm fire, continuing from the first scene of the film. They receive news of Henry IV's death and that Hal's coronation will be held that morning. Falstaff becomes ecstatic and goes directly to the castle, thinking that he will become a great and powerful nobleman under King Henry V. At the coronation, Falstaff cannot contain his excitement and interrupts the entire ceremony, announcing himself to Hal. Hal turns his back on Falstaff and proclaims that he is now finished with his former lifestyle. As Falstaff looks up at Hal with a mixture of pride and despair, the new king banishes Falstaff. The coronation continues into the castle as Falstaff walks away, stating that he will be sent for that evening. That night, Falstaff dies at the Boar's Head Tavern, and his friends mourn him, saying that he died of a broken heart. The narrator explains that Hal went on to become a good and noble king.\n\n\nWelles' inspiration for \"Chimes at Midnight\" began in 1930 when he was a student at the Todd School for Boys in Woodstock, Illinois. Welles tried to stage a three-and-a-half-hour combination of several of Shakespeare's historical plays called \"The Winter of Our Discontent\" in which he played Richard III. School officials forced him to make cuts to the production. \"Chimes at Midnight\" originated in 1939 as a stage play called \"Five Kings\", which Welles wrote and partially staged. It was an ambitious adaptation of several Shakespeare plays that chronicled the stories of Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI and Richard III. Its sources were \"Richard II\", \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\", \"Henry V\", \"The Merry Wives of Windsor\", \"Henry VI, Part 1\", \"Henry VI, Part 2\", \"Henry VI, Part 3\" and \"Richard III\"sometimes collectively called the \"War of the Roses cycle\". The grouping of \"Henry IV, Part 1\", \"Henry IV, Part 2\" and \"Henry V\" are often referred to as the \"Henriad\".\n\n\"Five Kings\" was announced as part of the newly revived Mercury Theatre's second season in 1938. John Houseman had secured a partnership with the prestigious Theatre Guild to produce the play for , with an initial tour of Baltimore, Boston, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia before debuting on Broadway. Welles' intended to stage only the first part of the playwhich was primarily taken from \"Henry IV Parts 1 and 2\" and \"Henry V\"during the tour while simultaneously rehearsing Part Two and finally debuting the full production on Broadway. Houseman stated that the play's aim was \"to combine the immediate quality of the Elizabethan with all the devices and techniques possible in the modern theatre.\" The cast included Welles as Falstaff, Burgess Meredith as Prince Hal, John Emery as Hotspur, Morris Ankrum as Henry IV and Robert Speaight as the Narrator. The play's music was composed by Aaron Copland. Welles commissioned an elaborate revolving set to be built, but it was not completed during the five weeks allotted to rehearsals.\n\nWelles avoided attending the rehearsals or finishing the play's final script and instead often went out drinking and socializing with co-star Meredith, with the result that only specific scenes or fragments of the play were ever rehearsed. The Baltimore performance was eventually dropped and at the first dress rehearsal in Boston, it was discovered that the play was over five and a half hours long and contained 46 scenes. Welles cut 14 scenes and shortened others, which caused the built-in timer for the revolving set to move out of synchronization. \"Five Kings, Part 1\" premiered at the Colonial Theatre in Boston on February 27, 1939, and was a disaster. Critics were either scathing or apologetic, and only the play's battle scenes received praise. By the end of the Boston run, the Theatre Guild was on the verge of dropping the production, and canceled the D.C. engagement. Welles then edited the show to three and a half hours. The play closed after only a few performances in Philadelphia, and the Theatre Guild terminated its contract with the Mercury Theater. Photographs of the play's rehearsals show similarities to \"Chimes at Midnight\", including the Boar's Head Tavern set and the character blocking of the \"chimes at midnight\" scene with Falstaff, Shallow and Silence.\n\nWelles returned to the project in 1960, with performances in Belfast and Dublin. This version, now retitled \"Chimes at Midnight\", was produced by Welles' old friend Hilton Edwards through his Dublin-based company Gate Theatre. The cast included Welles as Falstaff, Keith Baxter as Prince Hal, Hilton Edwards as the Narrator, Reginald Jarman as Henry IV and Alexis Kanner as Hotspur. At one point, Welles and Edwards wanted Micheál Mac Liammóir to replace Jarman as Henry IV, but Mac Liammóir would only accept the role of Prince Hal. Hilton Edwards was officially credited as director, but Welles is usually acknowledged as the actual director and was often the director throughout rehearsals. Welles' alleged biological son Michael Lindsay-Hogg also worked on the play as an actor and as Edwards's personal assistant. Welles' opinion of Falstaff had intensified since first playing the part, and his new version of the play focused more upon the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal than on the historical story of Hal's defeat of Hotspur. Most of the scenes from \"Henry V\" used in the first version before were removed. Welles intended to perform the play in Belfast, Dublin and London before filming it in Yugoslavia.\n\nRehearsals began in Russell Square, London, with a read-through. After a week of rehearsing, Welles left to secure further funding and Edwards directed the play, working on blocking and lighting. Welles returned two days before the premiere and the cast had their first dress rehearsal, which lasted until 3 a.m. After premiering at the Grand Opera House in Belfast on February 13, 1960, and receiving a good review from a \"Variety\" correspondent, the play closed after five performances because of low attendances. It moved to the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin, where it fared no better. By the end of the second week, Welles had resorted to reading portions of the works of Irish author J. M. Synge, and from \"Riders to the Sea\", to attract an audience. Eventually the play simply became a version of \"An Evening with Orson Welles\", which would often include a question and answer section with the audience and Welles' solo performance of \"Moby Dick—Rehearsed\" or the works of Isak Dinesen.\n\nWelles continued to adjust the play throughout its short production, and at one point moved Mistress Quickly's speech about Falstaff's death to the very beginning of the play. Welles finally abandoned the entire project in late March 1960, when his friend Laurence Olivier offered him the chance to direct him in Eugène Ionesco's play \"Rhinoceros\" on London's West End. According to Keith Baxter, Welles ended the play's run because he was bored with it, and at one point told Baxter \"This is only a rehearsal for the movie, Keith, and I'll never make it unless you play Hal in that too.\" Five years later, Baxter and Welles' youngest daughter, Beatrice Welles, who played Falstaff's page, were the only cast members from the play to appear in the film. \"Chimes at Midnight\" was Welles' final performance in a theatrical play.\n\nIn 1964, Welles met and befriended Spanish film producer Emiliano Piedra, who wanted to work with him. Piedra did not think a Shakespearian film was marketable enough and proposed that Welles make a version of \"Treasure Island\" instead. Welles agreed to this on condition that he could simultaneously make \"Chimes at Midnight\", and Piedra agreed not knowing that Welles had no intention of making \"Treasure Island\". Although some B-roll footage of the Alicante departing from port was shot early in the production, no scenes from \"Treasure Island\" were ever shot or even scripted. Welles got away with this trick throughout preproduction by building sets that could be used in both films, such as Mistress Quickly's Boar's Head Tavern, which would double as the Admiral Benbow Inn. Welles also cast each actor in both films, casting himself as Long John Silver, Baxter as Dr. Livesey, Beckley as Israel Hands and Gielgud as Squire Trelawney. Ironically Welles would eventually play Long John Silver in the unrelated 1972 film version of \"Treasure Island\".\n\nWelles said that the Boar's Head Tavern was the only full set built for the film, and the other sets were simply dressed or decorated on location. Welles stated that he designed, painted and blow-torched the set, and designed all of the film's costumes. Early in pre-production Welles was approached by Anthony Perkins to play Prince Hal, but Welles had already promised the role to Keith Baxter. Hilton Edwards was initially cast as Justice Silence, but was replaced after he became ill. The title \"Chimes at Midnight\" derives from \"Henry IV, Part 2\", where in response to Justice Shallow's reminiscing of their long-past school days, Falstaff states: \"We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow\". Welles scholar Bridget Gellert Lyons said that the film's title, \"which is given further resonance by the repeated intoning of bells throughout the film, is associated for the audience with sadness and mortality more than youthful carousal.\"\n\nThe film was shot in Spain from September 1964 until April 1965, with a break in filming from late December until late February. Welles' limitations on the film included a budget of $800,000 and actors Jeanne Moreau and John Gielgud being available for five and ten days respectively, while Margaret Rutherford was only available for four weeks. Welles later joked that during one scene which included seven principal characters, none of the actors were available and stand-ins were used for over-the-shoulder shots of all seven characters. Filming began in Colmenar and included all of John Gielgud's scenes. Welles then traveled to Cardona, where the Royal Court scenes and Marina Vlady's scenes were shot, and to Madrid's Casa de Campo Park, where the Gadshill robbery scene was filmed. Madrid was also the location of the Boar's Head Tavern set, where Welles shot Moreau's and Rutherford's scenes. The production then traveled to Pedraza for some outdoor street scenes, and then to Soria to shoot in the snow for the opening shots. After shooting some scenes with Justice Shallow and Justice Silence in the Basque country, Welles returned to Madrid in December to film the battle scenes in Casa de Campo Park for ten days.\n\nBy late December, Welles had run out of money and the film was put on hold while he searched for additional funding. However, some small scenes were shot during the break. Welles later said that he had rejected offers for funding that were conditional upon filming in color. Welles eventually secured funding from Harry Saltzman and production officially resumed in late February with most of Keith Baxter's longer speeches and the Coronation scene in Madrid. Between March and April, Welles finished the film with filler shots, close-ups, the final rejection scene and most of Falstaff's speeches. According to Keith Baxter, Welles had stage fright and delayed all of his scenes until the very end of filming, except for scenes that included other actors. Welles was timid about shooting his love scene with Moreau, and used a double whenever possible. Other filming locations included the Chateau Calatañazor, Puerta de San Vincente, the Soria Cathedral and the city of Ávila. Welles was harsh with his crew members and according to actor Andrew Faulds, \"he spoke in five different languages to them and was pretty offensivevery demanding. I suppose he'd worked out that if you bullied actors, you didn't get the best from them whereas, to hell with the technicians. They had to do as they were told, and pretty quick.\" A scene depicting the assassination of King Richard II, originally intended to open the film, was cut.\n\nKeith Baxter said that the film's soundtrack was post-dubbed months after filming was completed, and that actors Fernando Rey and Marina Vlady were dubbed by different actors because of their heavy accents. Baxter also stated that he, Welles and Michael Aldridge recorded voices for several characters in post-production. Mistress Quickly's speech after Falstaff's death, which was disrupted by the audible hum of a power generator, used the original version of the soundtrack because Welles liked Margaret Rutherford's performance enough to keep it. The score was composed by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino, who had worked with Welles on \"Othello\". The score was recorded in an Italian studio, which paid Lavagnino for his work on the film in exchange for the rights to the music, and later released a soundtrack album in Italy and the UK. During the editing, Welles showed a rough cut to the visiting head of the Cannes Film Festival, who immediately wanted to include the film in the festival, and Welles had to finish the editing more quickly than he preferred.\n\nWelles had originally wanted the entire film to use high-contrast cinematography, resembling engravings of the Middle Ages; only the opening title sequence uses this technique. The film's most famous sequence is the Battle of Shrewsbury; only about 180 extras were available and Welles used editing techniques to give the appearance of armies of thousands. Welles filmed all of the battle scenes in long takes, but cut the shots into fragments to create the effect that he wanted. It took ten days to shoot the scenes and six weeks to edit what became a six-minute sequence. In filming the sequence, Welles often used hand-held cameras, wide-angle lenses, slow motion and speed up shots, static shots, swish pans and constant rapid movement of the characters to create a kinetic and chaotic atmosphere. Anderegg has said that \"in the end, both armies have become one huge, awkward, disintegrating war machine, a grotesque robot whose power source slowly begins to fail and finally comes to a frozen halt. Verbal rhetoric—language itself—seems, for the moment, both irrelevant and obscene.\"\n\nThe Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has often been called an anti-war statement by film critics and likened to contemporary films like \"Dr. Strangelove\" and \"Culloden\". Shakespearean scholar Daniel Seltzer said that \"the social consciousness of the movie is as alert as Shakespeare's, and thematically pertinent in Shakespearean terms too ... the footage of the Battle of Shrewsbury itself must be some of the finest, truest, ugliest scenes of warfare ever shot and edited for a movie.\" Welles scholar James Naremore said that \"the underlying eroticism of the chivalric code ... is exposed in all its cruel perversity.\" Tony Howard wrote that Welles used Shakespeare's historical plays \"to denounce modern political hypocrisy and militarism.\"\n\nDue to budgetary constraints, both the on-set and post-production sound was poorly recorded. Anderegg wrote that this, in combination with Welles' fast-paced camera movements and editing, makes the Shakespearean dialogue more difficult to understand. Many scenes are shot in long takes or with character's backs facing the camera, most likely for practical purposes when actors were not present, creating more sound problems. \"In effect,\" Anderegg writes, \"Welles generates a constant tension between what we see and what we hear, a tension that points to the ambiguous status of language in its relation to action.\" During the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence, Welles used a complex and layered soundtrack that included the sounds of swords and armor clanking, soldiers grunting and screaming, bones breaking, boots in the mud and the film's musical score to add to the chaos of the scene.\n\nWelles' adaptation of five Shakespeare plays was not a chronological transcription of the original texts. Shakespearean scholar Kenneth S. Rothwell said that Welles \"goes beyond mere tinkering with Shakespeare's scenes; [he] massively reworks, transposes, revises and deletes, indeed reconstructs them.\" These changes included taking lines of dialogue from one play and inserting them into scenes from another. Specific changes include a scene near the end of the film in which Hal pardons an imprisoned street rabble-rouser just before his expedition to invade France; Welles slightly altered this scene from \"Henry V\", Act 2, Scene 2. In the film it is stated that this man is Falstaff, and that the incident he is pardoning is Falstaff's disturbance of Hal's coronation. Although both the pardoned prisoner and Falstaff are said to drink wine, Shakespeare does not imply that the pardoned prisoner is Falstaff. In both \"Chimes at Midnight\" and in \"Henry V\", this scene is followed by Falstaff's death. The film contains no true soliloquies, since characters are never alone and do not speak directly to the audience during their speeches. Henry IV is usually shown standing or sitting with very little action involvedthis, says Anderegg, makes it appear that he speaks only to himself even when others are present. Gielgud was known for his classical interpretation of Shakespeare, and his performance consists almost entirely of words, which are unable to defeat either Northumberland's rebels or Hal's wild behavior. Throughout the film, Falstaff, Hal, and Hotspur imitate Gielgud, mocking the words of Henry IV.\n\n\"Chimes at Midnight\" premiered to a positive audience reception at the 1966 Cannes Film Festival. However, after \"New York Times\" critic Bosley Crowther's unfavorable advance review, American distributor Harry Saltzman decided to give the film little publicity and minimal distribution when it was released in the U.S. the next year. Critical reception on its first release was mostly negative; the film was not regarded as one of Welles' best until years later. Crowther criticized the film's poor audio track and called it \"a confusing patchwork of scenes and characters ... designed to give major exposure to Jack Falstaff.\" Welles' performance, he said, was \"a dissolute, bumbling street-corner Santa Claus.\" Penelope Houston called it \"a film which seems to turn its back on brilliance.\" A \"Time\" review also criticized Welles, stating that \"[he] is probably the first actor in the history of the theater to appear too fat for the role ... he takes command of scenes less with spoken English than with body English\", but that he is \"never entirely bad.\"\n\nJudith Crist praised the film as \"stark, simple, concentrating on word and performance, serv[ing] as a reminder of where the substance of the play lies.\" Pauline Kael also criticized the poor sound, but gave a favorable review overall, singling out the film's casting and calling Welles' performance \"very rich, very full.\" She said the Battle of Shrewsbury sequence was \"unlike any battle scene done on the screen before.\" \"Cahiers du Cinema\" critic Serge Daney also praised both the film and Welles' ability to make great films on the subject of power. Welles was disappointed with the film's reception, complaining that \"almost nobody has seen it in America, and that drives me nuts.\"\n\nWelles held \"Chimes at Midnight\" in high regard. \"It's my favorite picture, yes,\" he told interviewer Leslie Megahey in a 1982 interview for \"BBC Arena\":\n\nIf I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up. I think it's because it is to me the least flawed; let me put it that way. It is the most successful for what I tried to do. I succeeded more completely in my view with that than with anything else.\n\nHe also considered it to be his most personal film, along with \"The Magnificent Ambersons\". Many critics, including Peter Bogdanovich and Jonathan Rosenbaum, also consider \"Chimes at Midnight\" to be Welles' finest work. Several years after its initial release, film critic Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Chimes at Midnight\" \"may be the greatest Shakespearean film ever made, bar none.\" Joseph McBride has called it \"Welles' masterpiece, the fullest, most completely realized expression of everything he had been working towards since \"Citizen Kane\".\" In 2006, Roger Ebert praised the film as \"a magnificent film, clearly among Welles' greatest work.\"\n\nThe Battle of Shrewsbury sequence has been particularly admired, and inspired later movies, including \"Braveheart\" and \"Saving Private Ryan\". Film critics have compared it to the Odessa Steps sequence in \"Battleship Potemkin\" and the Battle on the Ice sequence in \"Alexander Nevsky\", both directed by Sergei Eisenstein. Kenneth Branagh's \"Henry V\" used Welles' Battle of Shrewsbury sequence as an inspiration for the Battle of Agincourt, and depicted Prince Hal's rejection of Falstaff in a way that was more influenced by \"Chimes at Midnight\" than from more traditional interpretations of the scene. In 1988, director Patrick Garland staged a version of \"Chimes at Midnight\" starring Simon Callow as Falstaff at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Michael Anderegg said that \"Chimes at Midnight\"s use of wide angle lenses, low-key lighting and costumes, and its focus on the relationship between Falstaff and Prince Hal influenced \"My Own Private Idaho\"Gus Van Sant's 1991 loose adaptation of \"Henry IV Parts 1 and 2\".\n\nIn 2011, Bonham's Auction House sold a large archive of Welles' material that had once belonged to the film's executive producer Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Most of the material was from \"Chimes at Midnight\", and included Welles' original art-work, photographs and memoranda. This collection was later donated to the University of Michigan for scholarly study.\n\nIn 2012, for the British Film Institute's \"Sight and Sound\" poll, 11 film critics and two directors voted \"Chimes at Midnight\" one of the 10 greatest films of all time, including McBride and Todd McCarthy.\n\nSpanish writer and director of the Film Library of Catalonia Esteve Riambau published a book about the film called \"The Things We've Seen: Welles and Falstaff\" in 2015.\n\nAt the 1966 Cannes Film Festival, \"Chimes at Midnight\" was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or and won the 20th Anniversary Prize and the Technical Grand Prize. Welles was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Actor in 1968 In Spain, the film won the Citizens Writers Circle Award for Best Film in 1966.\n\nBecause of legal disputes over the rights, \"Chimes at Midnight\" has only been released twice on VHS video in the United States, neither of which is currently available. Harry Saltzman's widow Adriana Saltzman, the families of producers Emiliano Piedra and Angel Escolano and the estate of Orson Wellesmaintained by Beatrice Welles among others have all claimed ownership of the film. For many years the only available source was a region-free DVD from Brazil. Mr Bongo Records screened a restored version in the UK at Picturehouse Cinemas on August 1, 2011. In February 2015, the film was screened at the Sedona International Film Festival. Beatrice Welles attended and announced that \"a major DVD/Blu-ray label is interested in restoring and releasing \"Chimes at Midnight\".\" The pristine 35mm print was discovered by Distribpix Inc., who said it was \"in such great condition that it is begging for a full 4k scan restoration.\"\n\nThe film had a European release on DVD and Blu-ray on June 29, 2015.\n\nJanus Films released a restored version of the film on D.C.P. that premiered on January 1, 2016, at Film Forum in New York City January 1–12, 2016 and Cinefamily in Los Angeles. This restored version is not derived from the Distribpix print. Peter Becker, Criterion's president, said that the release is the product of more than 20 years of effort: \"There is no film we have waited longer for or worked harder to free up, and none we are prouder to present\", he said. Criterion released this restoration on DVD and Blu-ray on August 30, 2016.\n\nWelles considered Falstaff to be \"Shakespeare's greatest creation\" and said that the role was \"the most difficult part I've ever played.\" Keith Baxter believed that making the film was Welles' life's ambition. Before the 1939 Boston premiere of \"Five Kings\", Welles told journalists \"I will play him as a tragic figure. I hope, of course, he will be funny to the audience, just as he was funny to those around him. But his humor and wit were aroused merely by the fact that he wanted to please the prince. Falstaff, however, had the potential of greatness in him.\" Reviews for the 1939 play mention Welles' choice to downplay the traditional comedic elements of Falstaff in his performance. This reverence for the character increased over the years and by the time Welles made \"Chimes at Midnight\", his focus was entirely on the relationships between Falstaff, Hal and Henry IV. He believed that the core of the story was \"the betrayal of friendship.\" Welles called Hal's rejection of Falstaff \"one of the greatest scenes ever written, so the movie is really a preparation for it. Everything prepares for it.\" Throughout the film, Hal constantly turns his back on Falstaff, foreshadowing the film's ending.\n\nWelles said, \"the film was not intended as a lament for Falstaff, but for the death of Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed.\" Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the \"Lost Eden\" in Welles' work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called \"the central theme in Western culture.\" Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that \"even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of such a world is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit.\" Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles' depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a \"[p]ower baby ... an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature.\" Welles also called Falstaff \"the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama\", and said that \"the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only \"deliberately\", a clown.\"\n\nKeith Baxter compared Welles to Falstaff, since they were both perpetually short of money, often lied and cheated people to get what they needed and were always merry and fun loving. Film scholar Jack Jorgens also compared Welles to Falstaff, stating that \"to a man who directed and starred in a masterpiece and has since staggered through three decades of underfinanced, hurried, flawed films, scores of bit parts, narrations, and interviews which debased his talent, dozens of projects which died for want of persistence and financing, the story of a fat, aging jester exiled from his audience and no longer able to triumph over impossible obstacles with wit and torrential imagination might well seem tragic.\" When Joss Ackland played Falstaff on the stage in 1982, he said that he was more inspired by Welles than by Welles' performance as Falstaff, stating that \"like Falstaff, I believe he could have achieved so much, but it was frittered away.\" Kenneth S. Rothwell has called Hal's rejection of Falstaff allegorical to Hollywood's rejection of Welles. Welles had become deeply depressed in the late 1950s after the disappointment of making \"Touch of Evil\", his intended Hollywood come-back.\n\nWelles' biographer Simon Callow has compared Falstaff to Welles' father Richard Head Welles, stating that like Falstaff, Welles' father was \"a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is rejected by the person he loves the most.\" Welles' father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along with him when he was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protégé to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles' relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles' surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles' life-style and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles' father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, \"I always \"thought\" I killed him.\"\n\nWelles' alleged biological son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who was born out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play \"Chimes at Midnight\". This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg only saw Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was sixteen years old, Welles' eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles' influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles' youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of \"Chimes at Midnight\".\n\nBibliography\n\nCitations\n\n"}

The curse began when upset Giants fans in the New York metropolitan area placed a hex on the relocated franchise. The curse ended when the Giants won the 2010 World Series in their fourth World Series appearance since the move to San Francisco.\n\nAlthough the actual curse began in 1958, the story goes back to 1918 when Eddie Grant was killed while fighting in World War I. The team honored him with a commemorative plaque on the center field wall at the Polo Grounds. While the franchise was based in New York, the Giants won five World Series titles, with the longest drought between titles being 21 years. The last championship as the New York Giants came against the Cleveland Indians in 1954, notably featuring Willie Mays' famous catch in Game 1.\n\nIn the 1950s, Giants' owner Horace Stoneham began to consider moving the team to another city while needing a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds. San Francisco mayor George Christopher negotiated with Stoneham, approving the move to San Francisco starting with the 1958 season. The approval caused the upset Giants fans to storm the field during the last home game before the relocation, stealing the Eddie Grant plaque and losing the team identity. Following the move, upset Giants' fans in New York allegedly placed a hex on the San Francisco Giants, claiming the franchise would never win the World Series while based in San Francisco. Many believed all of the team's good luck is in New York.\n\nDuring the 50 years after placing the alleged Curse of Coogan's Bluff, the Giants made three World Series appearances and lost each time, two of which in 7-game Series. In 1962, in Game 3 of the playoff series that decided who would win the National League pennant and play in the World Series, the Giants overcame a two-run deficit in the 9th inning against the rival Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the pennant. In Game 7 of the 1962 World Series against the former crosstown rival New York Yankees, down 1–0 and with runners on second and third, Willie McCovey hit a sharp line drive, but the ball was caught by Yankees' second baseman Bobby Richardson to end the game and the Series.\n\nIn the 1989 World Series, the Giants were swept by another San Francisco Bay Area team, the Oakland Athletics. The 1989 Series was infamous for the large earthquake that struck the San Francisco Bay Area, delaying Games 3 and 4 of the World Series by 10 days. In the 2002 World Series against the Anaheim Angels, the Giants led 3 games to 2 heading back to Anaheim for Games 6 and 7, but the Giants lost the last two for the third World Series loss since moving to San Francisco. In Game 6 of that Series, the Giants held a commanding 5–0 lead heading into the 7th inning. However, the Giants allowed the Angels to score 6 unanswered runs in the 7th and 8th innings for one of the greatest comebacks in World Series history. The Giants lost Game 7 (and the Series) the next day 4–1.\n\nIn 2001, historian and author Mike Hanlon suggested to Giants owner Peter Magowan to have a new plaque to be installed at AT&T Park in the effort of ending their curse. In 2006, the development of the new plaque began but took two years due to problems of production. In 2008, the Eddie Grant plaque was installed on the tower at the right field. The installation of the plaque would prove effective for the team's chances of winning the championship. In 2010, the Giants won the division after passing the San Diego Padres for the NL West division lead late in the season. The Giants qualified to play in the World Series after defeating the Atlanta Braves in the National League Division Series and the Philadelphia Phillies (who made back-to-back World Series appearances in the previous year) in the National League Championship Series. The Giants defeated the Texas Rangers in five games to win the World Series championship for the first time since moving to San Francisco in 1958, thus ending the 52-year Curse of Coogan's Bluff. Following their 2010 championship, the Giants would win two more world championships in the next four years—in 2012 and in 2014. However they have yet to win the World Series clincher while playing in San Francisco.\n\n"}

It had 222 rooms.\n\nThe fire burned for ten hours. Many were unable to find the exit in the darkness. The fire department's ladders only reached the eighth floor, trapping those from the ninth to the 22nd storeys. At least 38 people died leaping from windows to escape the inferno, some clinging to mattresses in an attempt to survive the fall. 12 helicopters were mobilised to try to rescue guests from the roof using aerial slings. One man fell to his death from a helicopter.\n\nThe authorities arrested eight people in connection with the disaster. These included Kim Yong-san and four other hotel officials, who were charged with carelessness and improper construction, as well as two former city officials and a fire officer on charges of negligence.\n\nThe 162nd death was that of Yu Sien-yung, the minister of the Taiwanese embassy in Seoul, who lived alone in the hotel. He was trapped in the burning building for more than 10 hours and died in hospital, aged 64, on 4 January 1972.\n\nThe design of the building was said to have played a part in the high death toll. The two internal staircases were designed for use in case of lift failures and not as fire exits, and filled with smoke during the fire, acting as chimneys. The building had no external emergency staircase. The walls between the hotel rooms were not sufficiently fire resistant, hastening the spread of the blaze. The tower lacked many other safety features, including battery-operated exit lights.\n\nTwo senior fire services officers of the Hong Kong Government flew to Seoul on 11 January 1972 to confer with the South Koreans on fire prevention.\n\nThe building was remodeled after the fire.

Two hundred and thirty-nine people subscribed to the production of the trophy, each being limited to a maximum of twenty guineas (Circa £900 in modern terms).\n\nThe 4 foot 8 inch (140 cm) high trophy, weighing in at 1600 ounces (45 kg), was designed by Edmund Cotterill (1795–1860), made in a medieval Gothic style by Messrs. R & S Garrard, Silversmiths of London at a cost then of £1,775 (£78,277 in modern terms) and took four years to complete.\n\nEdmund Cotterill was in charge of the design studio at Garrards in 1843 and at the time of the Empire Exhibition (1851) he was said to stand \"at the head of the class of artists who model for silversmiths and his productions, annually exhibited at Messrs Garrard, have earned that house a celebrity which no other can equal\". The trophy is formed from modelled and cast silver components which were assembled together to create the final piece.\n\nThe Eglinton Trophy has a Hallmark and is therefore silver and not silver plate, it rises from a wide crenelated base on the sides of which are located the shields bearing the coats of arms of the fourteen Knights of the Tournament; a fifteenth shield is blank and four of the shields are in alcoves that extend from the base, accompanied by swords, quills, coronets, laurel leaf crown, etc. The 4 foot 8 inch (140 cm) trophy rises up as a highly ornate Gothic pulpit sitting beneath a pinnacled canopy under which Jane Georgiana, Lady Seymour, the Queen of Beauty stands in the act of placing a wreath upon the brow of the Earl of Eglinton, Lord and victor of the Eglinton Tournament.\n\nBeside the figure of the earl are the Knight Marshal, Sir Charles Montolieu Lamb, with a dismounted squire, and a halbardier, his escort and the presentation party. Two hunting dogs are also present, together with two pages, one male and one female, and a lady in waiting. The squire and the lady in waiting give the impression of exchanging glances. A coat of arms is also displayed on a shield behind Lady Seymour.\n\nThe glass case that covers the trophy has wooded framed sections and rises up from an ornately carved eight-sided wooden base emblazoned with four coats of arms, earls coronets, and with a silver engraved dedicatory shield. This base stands around 2 feet and 10 inches (85 cm) in height. The dedicatory shield reads \"Presented to Archibald, Earl of Eglinton, by the Visitors to the Eglinton Tournament held at Eglinton Castle. MDCCCXXXIX.\"\n\nA Hallmark is stamped on the base of the trophy, at the front. The Silver Standard Mark is a Lion passant indicating .925 purity, known as Sterling silver; the City Mark is an uncrowned Leopard indicating London as the city of manufacture, after the year 1822; the Maker's Mark is an \"RG\" beneath a Crown, indicating R & S Garrard after 1835 when James Garrard retired. The Crown indicates that the company had become official Crown Jewellers, an honour conferred on them by Queen Victoria in 1843; the Date Letter however is a Gothic \"G\" for the year 1842; and finally the Duty Mark stamp of Queen Victoria's head indicating that duty was paid on the item and that it was made before 1890.\n\nThe apparent disparity in dates just reflects the fact that the trophy was returned from the Assay Office in 1842 and finally assembled, completed and stamped by the maker for delivery to the committee and its presention to the earl in 1843. The Maker's Mark is not in alignment with the official Hallmark, lying slightly above.\n\nThe trophy, presented to Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton in 1843, was originally housed within the library at Eglinton Castle and later at the Ayr County Hall in Ayr. It was featured and illustrated in \"The Illustrated London News\" of June 1843. The trophy is now kept, housed within its original glass and wood case, in Cunninghame House, headquarters of North Ayrshire Council, having been loaned to the people of Ayrshire by the 14th Earl it is however still the property of the present Earl of Eglinton.\n\nFor a while during the construction of the headquarters of the then Cunninghame District Council it was housed at Wellwood, the home of the Irvine Burns Club and the official Royal Burgh of Irvine Museum.\n\nIt was moved to the Eglinton Country Park visitor centre in 1989 for the re-enactment that marked 150 years since the tournament and was also loaned to the Victoria and Albert Museum. It is insured by North Ayrshire Council for an undisclosed, but considerable sum, and was lent to East Ayrshire Council for a short time in 2011 (April 30 to August 20) as the centrepiece to an exhibition of James Henry Nixons (1802–1857) Eglinton Tournament prints at the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock.\n\nThe trophy is of great significance to the local and social history of the area and can be viewed by small groups during normal working hours by prior arrangement, after going through appropriate security procedures. \n\nA second silver trophy was presented to the Earl by 300 citizens of Glasgow. In 2014 a silver statuette measuring 44cm in height representing a knight in full armour with a jousting lance and a horse bearing the Earl of Eglinton's coat of arms was acquired by the East Ayrshire Leisure Trust on behalf of East Ayrshire Council. It is believed this is the only surviving part of the \"second silver trophy\" and that the rest of the candelabrum was melted down for its silver content after it was sold by the Earl of Eglinton in the 1920s. The silver hallmark shows that the statuette dates to 1840, three years before the Eglinton Trophy was completed. The silversmiths were Benjamin Smith III of London and D.C.Rait of Glasgow.\n\n\n"}

The arena for the event was the Nederlands Congrescentrum. Teach-In's victory in Stockholm the previous year gave The Netherlands the right to host the contest for the third time. The Contest was won by Brotherhood of Man, who sang \"Save Your Kisses for Me\" in English, representing the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Hague is the seat of government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the capital city of the province of South Holland. It is also the third largest city of the Netherlands, after Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Located in the west of the Netherlands, The Hague is in the centre of the Haaglanden conurbation and lies at the southwest corner of the larger Randstad conurbation.\n\nThe contest took place at the Congresgebouw (presently known as the \"World Forum\"). The venue was constructed in 1969.\n\nThe scoring system introduced in the previous year's competition returned in 1976. Each jury gave 12 points to the best song, 10 to the second best, then 8 to the third, and then 7 to 1 (from fourth to tenth best song, according to the jury). Unlike today, the points were not given in order (from 1 up to 12), but in the order the songs were performed. The current procedure was not established until 1980.\n\nSweden, Malta and Turkey withdrew from this contest reducing the number of participating countries down to eighteen from the previous competitions record of nineteen countries that took part. Austria and Greece returned to the contest.\n\nSweden withdrew from the contest, as the broadcaster Sveriges Radio (SR) did not have enough money to host another contest if Sweden won again. A new rule was therefore introduced that in the future each broadcaster participating would have to pay a part of the cost of staging the contest. As the author and historian John Kennedy O'Connor notes in his book \"The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History\", there had been public demonstrations in Sweden against the contest, which also played a part in SR's decision to withdraw. The same book also notes that the victorious song went on to become the biggest selling winning single in the history of the contest and won with 80.39% of the possible maximum score; a record under the voting system introduced in 1975.\n\nMalta, having selected Enzo Guzman with the song \"Sing Your Song, Country Boy\" to represent them, then withdrew from the contest for undisclosed reasons, as the singer has confirmed. Malta would not return to the competition until 1991. The entry from Greece aroused controversy as it was about the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. The previous year Greece had withdrawn from the contest in protest over this matter. This year it was Turkey's turn to withdraw.\n\nLiechtenstein attempted to submit an entry to the contest, but as they had no broadcasting service of their own, they were not allowed to. Their entry would have been \"Little Cowboy\" by Biggi Bachmann.\n\nEach performance had a conductor who maestro the orchestra.\n\nFour artists returned to the contest in 1976. Fredi who represented Finland in 1967, Sandra Reemer returned having represented Netherlands in 1972, Peter, Sue and Marc also returned having represented Switzerland in 1971, and finally Anne-Karine Strøm represented Norway again having last done so in 1974; she repeated her finishing result by coming last once more.\n\nThe following tables reflect the officially verified scores given by each jury, adjusted after the transmission. During the live broadcast, France failed to announce the 4 points they awarded to Yugoslavia, an error overlooked by the scrutineer, Clifford Brown. Thus in the live show, Norway were placed 17th and Yugoslavia 18th. After the broadcast, the scores were adjusted and the two nations swapped places, with Yugoslavia's score being adjusted from 6 to 10 points, moving Norway down to last place.\nBelow is a summary of all 12 points in the final:\n\nThe table below shows the order in which votes were cast during the 1976 contest along with the spokesperson who was responsible for announcing the votes for their respective country.\n\nEach national broadcaster [with the exception of Israel] also sent a commentator to the contest, in order to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language.\n\n"}

In 1956, it was given the name of the renowned Romanian playwright and poet Vasile Alecsandri.\n\nOne of the first theatrical performance in Romanian language, was organized by Gheorghe Asachi, and held in the capital of Moldavia, Jassy/Iași, on 27 September 1816. In 1834, a Romanian production took place in Iași on the stage of the Théâtre de varieté, built in 1832 for the French Fouraux troupe. \n\nThe National Theatre was founded on 15 May 1840, as the \"Great Theatre of Moldavia\", when the Romanian language troupe, led by Costache Caragiali, was united with the French troupe, under a single direction of Vasile Alecsandri and the management of Costache Caragiali. On 22 December 1846, a new audience hall was inaugurated in the former mansion of Prince Mihail Sturdza, on the Hill of Copou.\n\nOn the night of 17/18 February 1888, the theatre building was destroyed by the fire.\n\nThe efforts to build the new theatre edifice culminated in 1894 when a contract was signed with the Viennese architects Ferdinand Fellner and Hermann Helmer, who designed several theatres and palaces across Europe, including the theatres in: Cluj-Napoca, Oradea, Timișoara and Chernivtsi (Romanian: Cernăuți). \n\nFor the building work, a contract was signed with a Bucharest company, and the power station was built by a company from Berlin. The Theatre’s power station also supplied with electricity the 12 electric-arc lamps lighting the Theatre Square, marking the beginning of electrification in the city of Iași. The works to building took two years, and on 1 and 2 December 1896, the inauguration festivities took place with Flechtenmacher's \"National Overture\", the vaudevilles \"Muza de la Burdujeni\" (\"The Muse from Burdujeni\") by Costache Negruzzi and \"Cinel-cinel\" (\"The Riddle\") by Vasile Alecsandri, as well as the verse comedy \"Poetul romantic\" (\"The Romantic Poet\") by Matei Millo.\n\nNowadays, the building also hosts the Iași Romanian National Opera.\n\nThe Iași National Theatre building is listed in the National Register of Historic Monuments.\n\nWith a Neoclassic exterior and a richly decorated interior in Rococo and Baroque styles, the building is considered one of the most elegant in Romania.\n\nThe main auditorium is organised in stalls, boxes and a balcony. The curtain painted by the Viennese M. Lenz, presents in the middle, an allegory of life with its three stages and, to the right side, the allegory of Romanian Unification. The left-hand side, painted by Lenz’s apprentice, differs from the rest of the curtain in style and colouring.\n\nThe ceiling and the iron curtain were painted by Alexander Goltz. The iron curtain, which completely separates the scene from the hall, shows ornaments placed symmetrically, while the ceiling has as a narrative basis the Archetypal Story, shown in paradisiacal allegories, with nymphs and cupids framed in rococo stucco.\n\nThe 1,418 electric lights and the chandelier with 109 Venetian crystal lamps light up a playhouse with a unique architectural personality.\n\n"}

The attacks left 74 dead and 71 injured. Al-Shabaab, an Islamist militia based in Somalia that has ties to Al-Qaeda, claimed responsibility for the blasts as retaliation for Ugandan support for AMISOM. In March 2015, the trial of 13 Kenyan, Ugandan and Tanzanian alleged perpetrators of the bombings began at the High Court of Uganda.\n\nThe Al-Shabaab militant group grew into a potent force against the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) of Somalia and threatened attacks against foreign and AMISOM troops deployed against it in the country, including those from Uganda. The July 2010 attack in Kampala was seen as revenge against the Ugandan forces' presence in Somalia. Al Qaeda was also rumoured to have been involved in Somalia. The Kampala attack followed American warnings of attacks on Air Uganda planes in 2010.\n\nThe first bombing was carried out at a restaurant called the \"Ethiopian Village\", situated in the Kabalagala neighbourhood, with many of the victims foreigners. Fifteen people died in this attack. The Kabalagala bombing occurred during the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final.\n\nThe second attack, consisting of two explosions in quick succession, occurred at at Kyadondo Rugby Club in Nakawa, where state-run newspaper \"New Vision\" was hosting a screening of the match. According to eyewitnesses, there was an explosion near the 90th minute of the match, followed seconds later by a second explosion that knocked out the lights at the field. An explosion went off directly in front of a large screen that was showing the telecast from South Africa, killing 49 people. The discovery of a severed head and leg at the rugby field suggests that it was a suicide attack carried out by an individual. A third unexploded vest was later found.\nA Uganda Police Force officer stated the total death toll as 64. A further 71 were hospitalized, 14 of whom were treated for minor injuries and later discharged.\n\nUganda Police Force Inspector General Kale Kayihura stated, \"The information we have indicates the people who have attacked the Ethiopian Village were probably targeting expatriates.\"\n\nInitial reports of further blasts in the neighbourhoods of Ntinda and Bwaise were false.\n\nMost of the dead were Ugandan. Others included: a Sri Lankan, an Indian, an Irish Lay missionary, one American, one Ethiopian, six Eritreans, and one Kenyan.\n\nThe injured also included six Methodist missionaries from a Pennsylvania church.\n\nUgandan police made arrests in the days following the attack. Another Ugandan was arrested in Kenya over the attacks. Twenty people were arrested, including several Pakistanis, and Interpol also published facial reconstructions of two suspected bombers.\n\nUganda's police said they had come to believe two suicide bombers were part of the attacks. Facial reconstructions of the two suspected suicide bombers suggested one was of Somali origin and the other a black African of unknown origin. \"There is strong evidence that these attacks were carried out by suicide bombers.\" The facial identification were on two bodies which \"have remained unclaimed and unidentified.\"\n\nThree Kenyans — Hussein Hassan Agad, Mohamed Adan Abdow and Idris Magondu — were charged with 76 counts of murder. The Chief Magistrate, however, said they were not allowed to enter a plea because the court does not have jurisdiction to rule on the crime of terrorism. They are due back in court on 27 August, but will not be permitted to plead until the Directorate of Public Prosecutions decides the case is ready to move to the High Court. On 12 August 2010, chief of military intelligence James Mugira stated that all suspects at the time had been arrested. On 18 August 2010, Ugandan officials charged 32 people with murder. John Kagezi, the state attorney, said four of those charged confessed to the attacks. Court Hearings were to start for the Ugandan, Kenyan and Somali nationals on 2 September 2010; though police said continued investigations were ongoing and that more arrests may follow.\n\nAl-Shabaab, one of the groups in the Islamist insurgency in Somalia, has claimed responsibility for the attacks. \"The Wall Street Journal\" quotes an unnamed al-Shabaab senior leader stating, \"We have reached our objective. We killed many Christians in the enemy capital (Kampala).\" Reports also allege confirmation from other al-Shabaab militants. This is al-Shabaab's first attack outside of Somalia. On , al-Shabaab leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow had called for attacks against Uganda and Burundi. Al-Shabaab leader Sheik Yusuf Sheik Issa told Reuters \"Uganda is a major infidel country supporting the so-called government of Somalia. We know Uganda is against Islam and so we are very happy at what has happened in Kampala. That is the best news we ever heard.\" However he refused to confirm or deny responsibility after the attacks, also stating, \"Uganda is one of our enemies. Whatever makes them cry, makes us happy. May Allah's anger be upon those who are against us.\" By 12 July, Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage from Mogadishu stated \"We will carry out attacks against our enemy wherever they are ... No one will deter us from performing our Islamic duty.\" Sheik Ali Mohamud Rage, a spokesman for the group saying \"Al-Shabab was behind the two blasts in Uganda. We thank the mujahideens that carried out the attack. We are sending a message to Uganda and Burundi, if they do not take out their Amisom troops from Somalia, blasts will continue and it will happen.\"\n\nOn the 9 July 2017, Al-Shabaab released a video featuring one of the suicide bombers.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, Edris Nsubuga, aged 31, was sentenced to three concurrent 25-year sentences for his involvement in the Kampala attacks. After expressing regret and indicating that he had taken part in the bombings under threat of decapitation, he was spared the death penalty. Additionally, 24-year-old Muhamoud Mugisha was sentenced to five years imprisonment for conspiring to commit terrorism. They later provided importance evidence in the subsequent trial of 13 men.\n\nIn March 2015, the trial of 13 other men suspected of having been involved in the 2010 Kampala bombings began at the High Court of Uganda. The hearings had been delayed for five years due to court challenges by the apprehended individuals, who accused the Ugandan police and security agencies of torture and illegal rendition. The seven Kenyans, five Ugandans, and one Tanzanian were each charged with terrorism, murder, attempted murder, and of being accessories to terrorism, All but one were accused of being Al-Shabaab members.\n\nThe trial was again delayed when the prosecutor, Joan Kagezi, was murdered on 30 March 2015, purportedly by agents of Al-Shabaab. The trial resumed in June 2015.\n\nIn May 2016, all defendants were acquitted of being members of Al-Shabaab because, in 2010, that organization was not listed by Uganda as a terrorist organization. Seven of the suspects were convicted of terrorism, murder, and attempted murder. Ugandan Isa Ahmed Luyima, who is thought to have orchestrated the attacks, Kenyan Hussein Hassan Agad, Kenyan Idris Magondu, Kenyan Habib Suleiman Njoroge, and Kenyan Muhammed Ali Muhamed were sentenced to life imprisonment. The other two, Ugandan Hassan Haruna Luyima and Tanzanian Suleiman Hajjir Nyamandondo, were sentenced to 50 years imprisonment. Five of the suspects were acquitted (Kenyan Yahya Suleiman Mbuthia, Kenyan Muhammed Hamid Suleiman, Kenyan Mohammed Awadh, Ugandan Abubakari Batemetyo, and Ugandan Ismail Kalule). Ugandan Muzafaru Luyima was acquitted of terrorism but convicted of aiding the attackers. He was sentenced to one year of community service. Two sets of brothers were tried in this case: Isa Ahmed Luyima and Muzafaru Luyima; Yahya Suleiman Mbuthia and Habib Suleiman Njoroge.\n\n\n"}

Meyer-Landrut represented Germany for the second consecutive time in the Eurovision Song Contest at Düsseldorf in 2011 with the song \"Taken by a Stranger\", placing 10th.\n\nMeyer-Landrut performed as part of the interval act during the second semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. In September she released the single \"Stardust\" from the album of the same name which was released on 12 October. A second single, \"Neon (Lonely People)\", was released in March 2013. At the 2013 Echo Awards that same month, she won the Best National Video award for \"Stardust\". Following her No One Can Catch Us Tour she was one of three judges on the show \"The Voice Kids\".\n\nIn 2014 and 2015 Meyer-Landrut returned as a judge on the second and third season of \"The Voice Kids\". In March 2015 she released the single \"Traffic Lights\" and the fourth studio album on which it appears, \"Crystal Sky\", in May. The single from her yet to be released album \"Gemini\", \"Lost in You\", was released in April 2017. She also appeared on the fourth season of the German TV show \"Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert\" (Sing My Song – The Exchange Concert).\n\nMeyer-Landrut has also voiced characters in several audiobooks and an animated film \"Tarzan (2013 film)\". She has been a brand ambassador for L'Oréal hair coloring and skin care products.\n\nLena Meyer-Landrut was born in Hanover, Germany, on 23 May 1991. She is the granddaughter of Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the Estonian-born West German ambassador to the Soviet Union in Moscow from 1980 to 1983 and 1987 to 1989, and Hanna Karatsony von Hodos who was born in Bratislava, Slovakia of Hungarian nobility. She grew up as an only child, and started taking dancing lessons at the age of five; initially doing ballet and later practising various modern styles, including hip-hop and jazz dance. Meyer-Landrut grew fond of singing and appeared as an extra in a number of German television series, though she never received any formal acting or vocal training. In June 2010 she graduated from IGS Roderbruch Hannover, a comprehensive school, receiving her Abitur diploma.\n\nMeyer-Landrut decided to take part in the talent show \"Unser Star für Oslo\" (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created national television programme to select the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo. The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. From 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she said, \"I like to test myself. I wanted to see how I am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all.\"\n\nAfter her first appearance, performing \"My Same\" by British singer Adele, Meyer-Landrut received much praise from the show's jury panel and was instantly considered the favourite. The following week, Adele's \"My Same\" entered the German singles chart at number 61. Meyer-Landrut reached the final of \"Unser Star für Oslo\", mainly performing lesser-known songs by international artists The Bird and the Bee, Kate Nash, Paolo Nutini and Lisa Mitchell. Of her eight cover performances, five of the original songs subsequently charted in Germany, with all but \"Foundations\" reaching their peak chart position. In the final, on 12 March 2010, Meyer-Landrut sang three songs specifically written for the contest, \"Bee\", \"Satellite\" and \"Love Me\". Through televoting the audience chose \"Satellite\", written by American Julie Frost and Dane John Gordon, to be her designated song in the event she won the show. In a second round of voting Meyer-Landrut was chosen as Germany's entry for the 55th Eurovision Song Contest, beating the last remaining contestant, Jennifer Braun. The music video for \"Satellite\" was shot during the night of the final and premiered on German television stations four days later.\n\nThroughout the show, Meyer-Landrut was seen as the clear favourite. One day after winning \"Unser Star für Oslo\", her three songs from the finals topped the German iTunes Store sales chart, making her the first singer to accomplish this. \"Satellite\" sold over 100,000 downloads in its first week, becoming Germany's fastest-selling digital release ever. Her three songs entered the top five of the German singles chart reaching positions one, three and four. No artist had achieved this since the charts were first established in Germany in 1959. \"Satellite\" was certified gold after the first week and platinum after the fourth week of its release. The song remained at number one for five consecutive weeks in Germany.\n\nWhile competing at \"Unser Star für Oslo\", Meyer-Landrut continued to attend school. The last show was held one month before the start of her final exams. Following them she released her debut album, \"My Cassette Player\", on 7 May 2010. Produced by Stefan Raab, it includes the singles \"Satellite\", \"Love Me\" and \"Bee\", as well as two cover songs and eight unreleased titles. Meyer-Landrut is credited as a co-writer for the lyrics of five songs. The album debuted at number one on the German albums chart. It peaked at number one on the Austrian albums chart, and at number three on the Swiss albums chart. \"Satellite\" has been certified double Platinum, and the album has been certified five times Gold for sales of over 500,000 units.\n\nFollowing her success in Germany Meyer-Landrut said she would enjoy pursuing a singing or acting career, but explained, \"I'm not fixated on doing music my whole life.\" She said she originally planned to study acting after graduating school, but now is unsure \"if time allows\". She said her musical influences include Adele, Kate Nash, Vanessa Carlton, as well as the singer Clueso, and German pop rock band Wir sind Helden.\n\nRepresenting a \"big four\" country, Meyer-Landrut automatically qualified for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2010. Germany received a wild card during the running order draw, allowing the German representatives to choose the country's position for the final. They chose position 22 out of the 25 spots. Meyer-Landrut arrived in Oslo one week before the show and completed five rehearsals of her song \"Satellite\". Before the final, she was considered one of the favourites. Bookmakers regarded her as the second favourite behind Azerbaijan's Safura, while Google projected she would win based on search volume in the participating countries. According to Norway's \"Aftenposten\" she received the most media attention of all the participants.\n\nThe final was held on 29 May 2010 at Oslo's Telenor Arena. Appearing fourth from last, Meyer-Landrut wore a simple black dress and performed on a bare stage with four backing singers. Her pared-back presentation was a break from recent Eurovision trends, as it did not feature any choreography, dancers or an elaborate stage show. \"Satellite\" received a total of 246 points, giving Germany its first win since 1982, and the first victory as a unified country. The song won over Turkey's entry \"We Could Be the Same\" with a margin of 76 points, the second largest in Eurovision history, second only to Alexander Rybak's margin of 169 points in the 2009 contest. (It would later be eclipsed by Loreen's victory in 2012, sporting a margin of 113 points). \"Satellite\" was awarded the maximum of 12 points nine times and received points from all but five countries.\nThe BBC called \"Satellite\" the first \"contemporary pop hit Eurovision has produced in decades,\" ushering in \"a new era for the annual music jamboree\". Meyer-Landrut's victory received much attention in Germany and the show was seen by 15 million viewers on German television (a 49.1 percent market share). She returned to Hanover the following day, where she was greeted by 40,000 people. In June, \"Satellite\" regained the top spot on the German singles chart for one week and also peaked at number one in Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. It also topped the European Hot 100 singles chart—the first Eurovision song to do so.\n\nIn June 2010 in the German dubbed version of the computer-animated film \"\", Meyer-Landrut provided the voice for the character originally spoken by Isabelle Fuhrman.\n\nIn January 2011, the TV-Show \"Unser Song für Deutschland\" was held and Meyer-Landrut's 2011 Eurovision song was determined via televoting. The twelve songs Meyer-Landrut performed during that show were recorded on her second studio album \"Good News,\" which was released on 8 February 2011. The album reached Gold status in Germany within one week after its release. On 18 February 2011, the \"Unser Song für Deutschland\" final was held. It was decided through televoting that Meyer-Landrut would perform the entry \"Taken by a Stranger\" in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2011.\n\nIn April 2011, she went on her first German tour of the largest concert halls in Berlin, Hanover, Frankfurt, Dortmund, Leipzig, Hamburg, Munich, Stuttgart and Cologne, though the concerts were not sold out.\n\nIn May 2011, Meyer-Landrut attempted to defend her title for the second consecutive time in the 2011 Eurovision Song Contest at Düsseldorf. She was the third winner to do so, and the first in over 50 years. She sang the song \"Taken by a Stranger\", placing 10th. She also appeared in the opening performance of the show, less than an hour before she took the stage to represent Germany.\n\nOn 24 May 2012, Meyer-Landrut performed as part of the interval act during the second semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. She was joined by the five Eurovision winners from 2007 to 2011, which included Marija Šerifović, Dima Bilan, Alexander Rybak, and Ell & Nikki. Meyer-Landrut, Marija, Dima and Alexander performed their winning song entries accompanied by traditional Azeri instruments, and were joined by Ell & Nikki for a rendition of \"Waterloo\".\n\nIn late July and early August she went on a promotion tour, Lenas Wohnzimmer (Lena′s Lounge), which took her to Munich, Cologne, Hamburg and Berlin. She performed several of her new songs.\n\nMeyer-Landrut announced on her Twitter account that \"Stardust\" would be the first single from her new album of the same name on ! August. The single was released on 21 September and was certified Gold for selling 150,000 copies. The album was released on 12 October and debuted at number two on the German Albums chart. Since October 2012 she has performed the theme song in the opening credits of \"Sesamstraße\", the German version of \"Sesame Street\" accompanied by Elmo on trumpet. She covered the Pippi Longstocking song \"Sjörövar Fabbe\" (\"Seeräuber-Opa Fabian\") for the compilation album \"Giraffenaffen\" in November 2012.\n\nOn 18 January 2013, it was announced that the second single from Meyer-Landrut's album would be \"Neon (Lonely People)\". The music video for it was shot in early February, by director Bode Brodmüller in Rathenau-Hallen. He also directed the video for her first single from the third album, \"Stardust\". Lena's video for \"Neon (Lonely People)\", her sixth single, premiered on Universal Music's website on 1 March. It was released on 15 March, and the video was uploaded to Meyer-Landrut's Vevo channel on YouTube. The single is different from the original version on her \"Stardust\" album. It is a remixed, slightly faster dance song. Meyer-Landrut attended the 2013 Echo Awards on 21 March. She was nominated for two categories—Best National Video for \"Stardust\", and as Best National Female Artist. She won the Best National Video award, but lost the Best Female National Artist award to singer Ivy Quainoo.\n\nMeyer-Landrut went on a club tour through thirteen German cities starting in Stuttgart on 2 April 2013 and finishing in Offenbach am Main on 21 April. The final concert was streamed live via the Internet. The No One Can Catch Us Tour name was taken from a line on her first single from the album, \"Stardust\". In April and May 2013 she was one of three judges on the show \"The Voice Kids\" alongside Tim Bendzko and Henning Wehland.\n\nHer seventh single, \"Mr. Arrow Key\", the third single from \"Stardust,\" was released on 17 May 2013. It was written by Lena, Linda Carlsson and Sonny Boy Gustafsson, who also produced the track. Lena was president of the German jury (including Carolin Niemczyk, Alina Süggeler, Tim Bendzko and Florian Silbereisen) and the spokesperson for Germany, revealing the countries voting results at the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 final on 18 May.\n\nIn July 2013, it was announced that she would be the German voice of Jane in the motion capture animated film \"Tarzan 3D\", which was released in German cinemas in February 2014. In the same month she dubbed the voice of three characters in the two audiobooks \"Giraffenaffen – Wir sind da!\" (Giraffe-monkeys – We are here!) and \"Giraffenaffen – Die Schatzssuche\" (Giraffe-monkeys – Treasure hunt), which were both published in October 2013.\n\nMeyer-Landrut re-united with her Eurovision mentor Stefan Raab in October 2013 when she was featured on \"Revolution\", a single released by Raab's band Dicks on Fire. In June 2013, this song was used for a video promoting the Doosh shower head Doosh, invented by Stefan Raab. In it Lena poses as Lara Croft in the shower. In 2013 she became a L'Oréal hair coloring and skin care products brand ambassador.\n\nFrom March to May 2014 she returned as coach for the second season of \"The Voice Kids\" along with Henning Wehland (from the band Söhne Mannheims) and Johannes Strate (from the band Revolverheld).\n\nMeyer-Landrut began principal work on her fourth studio album \"Crystal Sky\" in 2014. Taking her sound further into the electro and dance pop genre, she worked with the English production and songwriting team Biffco, and the Berlin-based collective Beatgees on most of the album. In November 2014, one of their collaborations, the children's song \"Schlaft alle\" (Sleep all), appeared on the compilation album \"Giraffenaffen 3\". The same month, Meyer-Landrut's rendition of the Aladdin song \"A Whole New World\" was included on the compilation album \"I Love Disney\".\n\nFrom February to April 2015 Meyer-Landrut reprised her role as a coach on the third season of \"The Voice Kids\" along with singers Johannes Strate and Mark Forster. After four press concerts in Hamburg, Berlin, Munich, and Cologne from late February to early March 2015 she released \"Crystal Sky\"s first single \"Traffic Lights\" to radio in March 2015. It reached the top twenty of the German Singles Chart.\n\n\"Crystal Sky\" was released in May 2015. It marked her fourth consecutive album to reach the top two of the German Albums Chart. But it was less successful in Austria and Switzerland, where it failed to reach the top twenty on both music markets' charts. In September 2015, Meyer-Landrut released \"Wild & Free\", the theme song for the motion picture \"Fack ju Göhte 2\" as a single. The song peaked at number eight on the German Singles Chart, becoming her highest-charting single in three years.\n\nIn December 2016, Meyer-Landrut revealed on her Twitter account her forthcoming fifth studio album would be called \"Gemini\" and that she had already began working on it. In April 2017, Meyer-Landrut released a new song called \"Lost in You\". It was released on 14 April, and reached number 58 on the GfK Entertainment Charts. In November 2017 Meyer-Landrut stated via YouTube that she scrapped the album, because she was not happy with it. \n\nMeyer-Landrut participated in the fourth season of the German TV show \"Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert\" (Sing My Song – The Exchange Concert). In the third episode on 6 June, when the other artists performed Lena's songs, she premiered a new song \"If I Wasn't Your Daughter\". German press instantly discussed the song's content, which refers to Lena's relationship with her father who left the family when she was two. She has had no contact with him for more than twenty years. The song peaked at number 35 on the German charts.\n\nIn August 2017, Lena collaborated with the German hip hop group Genetikk where they recorded the single \"Lang lebe die Gang\". It was her second single with German lyrics after her cover version of \"Durch die Nacht\" by Silbermond from the television show Sing meinen Song in May 2017. In June 2018, she collaborated with DJ Topic and Spanish super star Juan Magán at the single \"Sólo Contigo\".\n\nIn October 2018 it was revealed, that Lena will return as coach for \"The Voice Kids\" 2019.\n\nIn November 2018, Lena released her first single \"Thank You\" from her upcoming fifth studio album \"Only Love, L\". The album will be released on 5 April 2019.\n\nMeyer-Landrut has been noted for her unconventional way of handling the press, which has been labelled \"aloof\" as well as \"quick-witted\" and \"intuitive\". She usually refuses to answer questions about her private life, including her family, friends and personal beliefs, sometimes calling questions \"stupid\" or responding with counterquestions instead. This has drawn praise as well as criticism, including allegations of being arrogant and disrespectful.\n\nMeyer-Landrut's demeanour has been described as \"carefree\", and \"laid-back and self-effacing\". She has been said to possess an \"adequate youthful megalomania,\" to \"cultivate her forwardness\" and to stand for \"unadorned genuineness\" and \"sincerity\". She has also been described as giving \"infatuation a rhythm\" and blurring the \"fine line between puppy love and psychotic obsession\" in her song \"Satellite\". Her vocals have been both praised and criticised. In an attempt to explain Meyer-Landrut's success, her appearance has been called a \"mix of loveliness, professionalism and a little craziness\". She has also been lauded for her stage presence and charisma.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "29327624", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29327624", "title": "List of Cincinnati riots", "text": "List of Cincinnati riots\n\nThere has been a long history of rioting in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States, since the city was founded in 1788. Some riots were fueled by racial tension, while others by issues such as employment conditions and political justice.\n\nThe first riot recorded in Cincinnati was in 1792, after a merchant named John Bartle was beaten by a soldier. Fifty people were involved in the fighting. The riot between settlers and soldiers occurred when spring flooding had driven many people out of their cabins.\n\nBy 1829, African Americans numbered almost 10% of the city's population.\nIn the Cincinnati Riots of 1829, about 1,000 of them were driven out of the town by violent mobs. Some of the displaced people moved north to settle in Canada. After the 1829 riots, a growing number of whites became sympathetic to the rights of Negroes, as they were called then.\n\nThe Cincinnati Riots of 1836 were caused by racial tensions at a time when African Americans, some of whom had escaped from slavery in the southern states of the United States, were competing with whites for jobs. The riots occurred in April and July. The rioters attacked both Negroes and the whites who supported them. A former slave owner from Alabama, James Gillespie Birney, had become an abolitionist. In January 1836 he set up the \"Cincinnati Weekly and Abolitionist\", a newspaper sponsored by the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society. The newspaper targeted slaveholders across the Ohio River in Kentucky with anti-slavery propaganda. This angered local businessmen who were keen to do business with the southern states. A riot broke out in April in which buildings were burned and several blacks lost their lives. The riot was only brought under control when the governor intervened and declared martial law. In July, the press that printed Birney's newspaper was twice destroyed, and further damage was caused to Negro properties.\n\nIn the Cincinnati riots of 1841, a mob of white men met in the Fifth Street Market and marched on \"Little Africa\", or \"Buck Town\"an area along the riverfront that was mainly inhabited by African Americans. The African Americans were armed and ready. Whites secured a cannon, rolled it down sixth street, faced it toward Buck Town, the name of the area where African American's resided, and fired it, lives were lost. Martial law was declared, 300 black men were arrested. While they were in custody, many of their homes were attacked.\n\nThe Cincinnati Riot of 1853 broke out on 25 December 1853. An armed mob of about 500 German men with 100 women following marched on the home of Bishop John Purcell, protesting a visit by Cardinal Gaetano Bedini, the emissary of Pope Pius IX. The Germans, many of whom had been involved in the European revolutions of 1848, or whose families had been involved, identified Bedini with the forces of reaction and oppression. One protester was killed and over 60 were arrested.\n\nThe Cincinnati riots of 1855 were clashes between \"nativists\" and German-Americans. The nativists supported J.D. Taylor, the mayoral candidate for the anti-immigrant American Party, also known as the Know-Nothing Party. German-Americans erected barricades in the streets leading into their Over-the-Rhine neighborhood, and fired a cannon over the heads of a mob of nativists attacking them.\n\nThe Cincinnati riots of 1884, also known as the Cincinnati Courthouse riots, were the most violent in the history of the city. They were caused by public outrage over the decision of a jury to return a verdict of manslaughter in a perceived clear case of murder. A mob in Cincinnati, Ohio, United States attempted to find and lynch the man. In the violence that followed over the next few days, over 50 people died and the courthouse and jail were destroyed.\n\nIn 1935 a fight between the students at Oyler School in Price Hill, one black and one white, quickly escalated. Police were forced to block the Eighth Street viaduct to separate groups of angry whites and blacks. During the riot, sixteen people were arrested.\n\nThe Avondale riot of 1967 followed years of police abuse and deteriorating living conditions in the poor black community of Avondale. The riots followed the disputed June 1967 conviction of Posteal Laskey Jr., accused of being the Cincinnati Strangler. The riots were ignited when Laskey's cousin, who was protesting the conviction, was arrested for loitering near the Abraham Lincoln statue at Rockdale Avenue and Reading Road on 12 June 1967.\nCrowds filled the streets and threw bottles and firebombs at businesses. The Ohio National Guard was called in to restore order.\nOne person died and there were 404 arrests. In 1968, President Lyndon Johnson's Commission on Civil Disorders issued a report that blamed the riots on the poverty of the segregated neighborhoods in Cincinnati and the practice of police officers in \"stopping Negroes on foot or in cars without obvious basis\" and using loitering laws disproportionately against minorities.\n\nThe Avondale riot of 1968 broke out in Avondale after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights leader, in April 1968. A mob smashed store windows and looted the stores or burned the merchandise.\nThe Ohio National Guard was called to restore peace in Avondale. Two people were killed, at least 220 injured and 260 arrested during two nights of violence.\n\nThe 2001 Cincinnati riots were the largest urban disorders in the United States since the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Three days of rioting were triggered by a fatal police shooting of an unarmed African-American teenager, Timothy Thomas. On the third night of violence, looting, and vandalizing, Charlie Luken, the mayor of Cincinnati at the time, issued a citywide curfew which happened to be accompanied by rain, and the riots stopped. The curfew was for all of Cincinnati, but was generally only enforced in the downtown area. There were no reports of rioting from the 13th or later. The immediate crisis had ended but the immediate damage was estimated at $3.6 million. Many business in the downtown area were damaged in the riots. Many of 63 rioters were indicted on felony charges.\n"}

Narcy Novack (née Narcisa Véliz Pacheco; born 1956), Ben's estranged wife, was convicted of orchestrating the murders and after a highly publicized trial, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nOn April 5, 2009, Ben's 87-year-old mother, Bernice, was found dead in her Fort Lauderdale, Florida home. Her husband Ben Novack Sr., who built the hotel and owned it until 1977, had died in 1985. Her death was initially ruled to be the result of an accidental fall while trying to get out of her car, but after her son's murder three months later, a subsequent police investigation revealed that her death was a homicide.\n\nOn the morning of July 12, 2009, her son, who was 53, was found bludgeoned and suffocated to death in the penthouse suite at the Hilton Hotel in Rye Brook, New York. He was bound with duct tape and his eyes were gouged out. At the time of his death, he was having an affair with porn actress Rebecca Bliss. He was also the heir to a multi-million dollar estate.<ref name=\"Narcy Novack case: Daughter poised to inherit multimillion dollar estate (NY/FL)\"></ref>\n\nNarcy Novack, from Fort Lauderdale, was arrested for the murders of her husband and mother-in-law in July 2010, three days shy of a year after her husband's death. Her brother, Cristóbal Véliz, was also accused of enlisting Alejandro Gutiérrez-García, Joel González, and Denis Ramírez to participate in both murders. Narcy and Véliz were tried together in a federal courtroom in White Plains, New York in 2012. The duo's defense was to blame Narcy's only daughter from a previous marriage, May Abad, for having orchestrated the killings, stating that she was motivated to collect on Ben Novack Jr.'s estate, including a large collection of Batman memorabilia. Prosecutors alleged that Narcy was afraid that her husband would leave her for his mistress, and that a prenuptial agreement would only leave her $65,000 instead of the bulk of her late husband's estate. They claimed she was motivated by \"hatred, greed, and vengeance.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the trial, Narcy and Veliz were each convicted of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, domestic violence, stalking, money laundering, and witness tampering. Narcy waived her right to appear in court when the guilty verdict was read. She also did not appear in court when she was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Novack is currently incarcerated at the Federal Correctional Institution Tallahassee in Tallahassee, Florida.

Fought shortly after the capture of Constantinople and the remnants of the Byzantine Empire by the Ottomans, it resulted in the loss of several Venetian holdings in Albania and Greece, most importantly the island of Negroponte (Euboea), which had been a Venetian protectorate for centuries. The war also saw the rapid expansion of the Ottoman navy, which became able to challenge the Venetians and the Knights Hospitaller for supremacy in the Aegean Sea. In the closing years of the war, however, the Republic managed to recoup its losses by the \"de facto\" acquisition of the Crusader Kingdom of Cyprus.\n\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade (1203–1204), the lands of the Byzantine Empire were divided among several western Catholic (\"Latin\") Crusader states, ushering in the period known in Greek as \"Latinokratia\". Despite the resurgence of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty in the later 13th century, many of these \"Latin\" states survived until the rise of a new power, the Ottoman Empire. Chief among these was the Republic of Venice, which had founded an extensive maritime empire, controlling numerous coastal possessions and islands in the Adriatic, Ionian and Aegean Seas. In its first conflict with the Ottomans, Venice had already lost the city of Thessalonica in 1430, following a long siege, but the resulting peace treaty left the other Venetian possessions intact. \n\nIn 1453, the Ottomans captured the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, and continued to expand their territories in the Balkans, Asia Minor and the Aegean. Serbia was conquered in 1459, and the last Byzantine remnants, the Despotate of Morea and the Empire of Trebizond were subdued in 1460–1461. The Venetian-controlled Duchy of Naxos and the Genoese colonies of Lesbos and Chios became tributary in 1458, only for the latter to be directly annexed four years later. The Ottoman advance thus inevitably posed a threat to Venice's holdings in southern Greece, and, following the Ottoman conquest of Bosnia in 1463, in the Adriatic coast as well.\n\nAccording to the Greek historian Michael Critobulus, hostilities broke out because of the flight of an Albanian slave of the Ottoman commander of Athens to the Venetian fortress of Coron (Koroni) with 100,000 silver aspers from his master's treasure. The fugitive then converted to Christianity, and demands for his rendition by the Ottomans were therefore refused by the Venetian authorities. Using this as a pretext, in November 1462, Turahanoğlu Ömer Bey, the Ottoman commander in central Greece, attacked and nearly succeeded in taking the strategically important Venetian fortress of Lepanto (Nafpaktos). On 3 April 1463 however, the governor of the Morea, Isa-Beg Ishaković, took the Venetian-held town of Argos by treason.\n\nAlthough Venice, dependent on the trade with the Ottomans, had in the past been reluctant to confront them in war, the urgings of the papal legate, Cardinal Bessarion, and an impassioned speech by the distinguished Council member Vettore Cappello, tipped the balance, and on 28 July, the Senate narrowly voted for declaring war on the Porte. Pope Pius II used this opportunity to form yet another Crusade against the Ottomans: on 12 September 1463, Venice and Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus signed an alliance, followed on 19 October by an alliance with the Pope and Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy. According to its terms, upon victory, the Balkans would be divided among the allies. The Morea and the western Greek coast (Epirus) would fall to Venice, Hungary would acquire Bulgaria, Serbia, Bosnia and Wallachia, the Albanian principality under Skanderbeg would expand into Macedonia, and the remaining European territories of the Ottomans, including Constantinople, would form a restored Byzantine Empire under the surviving members of the Palaiologos family. Negotiations were also begun with other rivals of the Ottomans, such as Karamanids, Uzun Hassan and the Crimean Khanate.\n\nThe new alliance launched a two-pronged offensive against the Ottomans: a Venetian army, under the Captain General of the Sea Alvise Loredan, landed in the Morea, while Matthias Corvinus invaded Bosnia. At the same time, Pius II began assembling an army at Ancona, hoping to lead it in person.\nIn early August, the Venetians retook Argos and refortified the Isthmus of Corinth, restoring the Hexamilion wall and equipping it with many cannons. They then proceeded to besiege the fortress of the Acrocorinth, which controlled the northwestern Peloponnese. The Venetians engaged in repeated clashes with the defenders and with Ömer Bey's forces, until they suffered a major defeat on 20 October, which resulted in the wounding and subsequent death of the Marquis (son of Taddeo d'Este). The Venetians were then forced to lift the siege and retreat to the Hexamilion and to Nauplia (Nafplion). In Bosnia, Matthias Corvinus seized over sixty fortified places and succeeded in taking its capital, Jajce after a 3-month siege, on 16 December.\n\nOttoman reaction was swift and decisive: Sultan Mehmed II dispatched his Grand Vizier, Mahmud Pasha Angelović, with an army against the Venetians. To confront the Venetian fleet, which had taken station outside the entrance of the Dardanelles Straits, the Sultan further ordered the creation of the new shipyard of Kadirga Limani in the Golden Horn (named after the \"kadirga\" type of galley), and of two forts to guard the Straits, Kilidulbahr and Sultaniye. The Morean campaign was swiftly victorious for the Ottomans: although messages received from Ömer Bey had warned of the strength and firepower of the Venetian position at the Hexamilion, Mahmud Pasha decided to march on, hoping to catch them at unawares. In the event, the Ottomans reached the Isthmus just in time to see the Venetian army, demoralized and riddled with dysentery, leave its positions and sail to Nauplia. The Ottoman army razed the Hexamilion, and advanced into the Morea. Argos fell, and several forts and localities that had recognized Venetian authority reverted to their Ottoman allegiance. Zagan Pasha was re-appointed governor of the Morea, while Ömer Bey was given Mahmud Pasha's army and tasked with taking the Republic's holdings in the southern Peloponnese, centered around the two forts of Coron and Modon (Methoni).\n\nSultan Mehmed II, who was following Mahmud Pasha with another army to reinforce him, had reached Zeitounion (Lamia) before being apprised of his Vizier's success. Immediately, he turned his men north, towards Bosnia. However, the Sultan's attempt to retake Jajce in July and August 1464 failed, with the Ottomans retreating hastily in the face of Corvinus' approaching army. A new Ottoman army under Mahmud Pasha then forced Corvinus to withdraw, but Jajce was not retaken for many years after. However, the death of Pope Pius II on 15 August in Ancona spelled the end of the Crusade.\nIn the meantime, for the upcoming campaign of 1464, the Republic had appointed Sigismondo Malatesta, the ruler of Rimini and one of the ablest Italian generals, as land commander in the Morea. The forces available to him along with mercenaries and \"stratioti\", however, were limited, and in his tenure in the Morea he was unable to achieve much. Upon his arrival in the Morea in mid-summer, he launched attacks against Ottoman forts, and engaged in a siege of Mistra in August–October. He failed to take the castle, however, and had to abandon the siege at the approach of a relief force under Ömer Bey. Small-scale warfare continued on both sides, with raids and counter-raids, but a shortage of manpower and money meant that the Venetians remained largely confined to their fortified bases, while Ömer Bey's army roamed the countryside. The mercenaries and stratioti in Venice's employ were becoming disgruntled at the lack of pay, while increasingly, the Morea was becoming desolate, as villages were abandoned and fields left untended. The bad supply situation in the Morea forced Ömer Bey to withdraw to Athens in fall 1465. Malatesta himself, disenchanted by the conditions he encountered in the Morea and increasingly anxious to return to Italy and attend to his family's affairs and the ongoing feud with the Papacy, remained largely inactive throughout 1465, in spite of the relative weakness of the Ottoman garrisons following the withdrawal of Ömer Bey from the peninsula.\n\nIn the Aegean, the new Venetian admiral, Orsato Giustinian, tried to take Lesbos in the spring of 1464, and besieged the capital Mytilene for six weeks, until the arrival of an Ottoman fleet under Mahmud Pasha on 18 May forced him to withdraw. Another attempt to capture the island shortly after also failed, and Giustinian died at Modon on 11 July. His successor, Jacopo Loredan, spent the remainder of the year in ultimately fruitless demonstrations of force before the Dardanelles. In early 1465, Mehmed II sent peace feelers to the Venetian Senate in 1465. Distrusting the Sultan's motives, these were rejected. Soon after, the Venetians were embroiled in a conflict with the Knights Hospitaller of Rhodes, who had attacked a Venetian convoy carrying Moorish merchants from the Mamluk Sultanate. This event enraged the Mamluks, who imprisoned all Venetian subjects living in the Levant, and threatened to enter the war on the Ottoman side. The Venetian fleet, under Loredan, sailed to Rhodes under orders to release the Moors, even by force. In the event, a potentially catastrophic war between the two major Christian powers of the Aegean was avoided, and the merchants were released to Venetian custody.\n\nBy 1465 the Maniot Kladas brothers, Krokodelos and Epifani, were leading bands of stratioti on behalf of Venice against the Turks in Southern Peloponnese. They put Vardounia and their lands into Venetian possession, for which Epifani then acted as governor.\n\nIn April 1466, Vettore Cappello, the most vociferous proponent of the war, replaced Loredan as Captain General of the Sea. Under his leadership, the Venetian war effort was reinvigorated: the fleet took the northern Aegean islands of Imbros, Thasos and Samothrace, and then sailed into the Saronic Gulf. On 12 July, Cappello landed at Piraeus, and marched against Athens, the Ottomans' major regional base. He failed to take the Acropolis, however, and was forced to retreat to Patras. Patras, being the capital of Peloponnese and the seat of the Ottoman Bey, was being besieged by the joint forces of Venetians and Greeks under the \"provveditore\" of the Morea, Jacomo Barbarigo and Spartan commander Michael Rallis. Before Cappello could arrive there, and as the city seemed on the verge of falling, Ömer Bey suddenly appeared with 12,000 cavalry, and drove the outnumbered besiegers off. Six hundred Venetians and a hundred others were taken prisoner out of a force of 2,000, while Barbarigo himself was killed, and his body impaled, while a hundred Greeks fell and Rallis was captured and impaled. Cappello, who arrived some days later, attacked the Ottomans, but was heavily defeated. Demoralized, he returned to Negroponte with the remains of his army. There Cappello fell ill and died on 13 March 1467. Negroponte itself was taken by the Turks three years later.\n\nIn spring 1466, Sultan Mehmed marched with a large army against the Albanians. Under their leader, Skenderbeg, they had long resisted the Ottomans, and had repeatedly sought assistance from Italy. For the Albanians, the outbreak of the Ottoman–Venetian War offered a golden opportunity to reassert their independence; for the Venetians, they provided a useful cover to the Venetian coastal holdings of Durazzo and Scutari. Notable Montenegrin feudal lord Ivan Crnojević was of high significance for the defence of Scutari, for which he gained fame in Venice. The major result of this campaign was the construction of the fortress of Elbasan, allegedly within just 25 days. This strategically sited fortress, at the lowlands near the end of the old \"Via Egnatia\", cut Albania effectively in half, isolating Skenderbeg's base in the northern highlands from the Venetian holdings in the south. However, following the Sultan's withdrawal Skanderbeg himself spent the winter in Italy, seeking aid. On his return in early 1467, his forces sallied from the highlands, defeated Ballaban Pasha and lifted the siege of the fortress of Croia (Krujë) attacked Elbasan but failed to capture it. Mehmed II responded by marching again against Albania. He energetically pursued the attacks against the Albanian strongholds, while sending detachments to raid the Venetian possessions to keep them isolated. The Ottomans failing again to take Croia, and they failed to subjugate the country. However, the winter brought an outbreak of plague, which would recur annually and sap the strength of the local resistance. Skanderbeg himself died of malaria in the Venetian stronghold of Lissus (Lezhë), ending the ability of Venice to use the Albanian lords for its own advantage. The Albanians were left to their own devices, and were gradually subdued over the next decade.\n\nAfter Skanderbeg died, some Venetian-controlled northern Albanian garrisons continued to hold territories coveted by the Ottomans, such as Žabljak Crnojevića, Drisht, Lezha, and Shkodra—the most significant. Mehmed II sent his armies to take Shkodra in 1474 but failed. Then he went personally to lead the siege of Shkodra of 1478-79. The Venetians and Shkodrans resisted the assaults and continued to hold the fortress until Venice ceded Shkodra to the Ottoman Empire in the Treaty of Constantinople as a condition of ending the war.\n\nAfter the Venetian War the Ottomans attacked Hungary, but their army was defeated in the Battle of Breadfield.\n\n"}
{"id": "8118361", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8118361", "title": "Pylon turn", "text": "Pylon turn\n\nA pylon turn is a flight maneuver in which an aircraft banks into a circular turn, in such a way that an imaginary line projecting straight out the side of the aircraft (nominally the wing) points to a fixed point on the ground. The maneuver originated early in the 20th century in air racing.\n\nIn some contexts, simply making a turn around a fixed point on the ground (such as a physical pylon) is called a \"pylon turn\". In these cases, the altitude may be incorrect for the maneuver to be a proper \"pylon turn\" where all three parameters (altitude, speed, bank angle) come together for the wing to point to the fixed turning center on the ground.\n\nThe pylon turn was originally used in air racing, where courses were set up with pylons to mark a location on the ground, and the planes would have to turn around at that point before returning to the airstrip. Pylons are also used in triples to set up a triangular circuit for aviation races—races in which all competitors must stay \"outside\" of the three pylons.\n\nA pylon turn is part of a maneuver also known as long-line loiter which can be used to deliver messages or packages by plane without needing to land. In this maneuver it is possible to lower a bucket on a line to the ground in such a way that the bucket remains stationary on the ground, permitting transfer of material. It was used during Operation Auca and depicted in the film \"End of the Spear\", to give gifts to the Huaorani people of Ecuador where there was no landing strip. Later some mail services have used the same technique to deliver mail where there are no available landing strips.\n\nThe mechanics of the maneuver allow it to occur only at the \"pivotal altitude\", which is a geometric and aerodynamic construction of ground speed and altitude above the ground.\n\nThe first notable combat use of the pylon turn was in the Vietnam War in 1964, with the development of the AC-47 Spooky gunship, which could fire miniguns mounted on the left side of the aircraft as the pilot circled the target. Later, the more advanced Lockheed AC-130 was used in the same way. Using this maneuver allowed gunners to fire continuously and efficiently at a stationary target for an extended period of time, without needing to make several passes. Another huge advantage of pylon turns was that the gunfire was accurate enough to be used even in close proximity to friendly troops, which had never before been possible in air power. Also, a similar method is used by attack helicopters, on which the armament shoots forward. In this case the helicopter strafes sideways in a circle around a single target. This method improves shooting accuracy, increasing hit probability.\n\n\n"}

Despite receiving moderate airplay from commercial radio in the United Kingdom, the single was not added to Radio 1's playlist, leading to accusations of ageism. The controversy stemmed from an article that appeared in the \"Daily Mail\", which quoted an unnamed Radio 1 insider describing Madonna as \"old\" and \"irrelevant\". In response, the singer's fans posted numerous requests for the song on BBC's social media accounts, and several artists criticized Radio 1's music policy, prompting the station to release a statement defending their decision not to play the track.\n\nThe controversy received significant media coverage in the United Kingdom and internationally, sparking a wider discussion about ageism in the music industry. \"Living for Love\" was subsequently added to BBC Radio 2's C-list, before being promoted to the B-list. The station caters to audiences who are aged 35 and higher. Commercially, the single peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart, for the week ending 28 February 2015.\n\nMadonna has received considerable airplay on BBC Radio 1 since the beginning of her career and made her first appearance on the station on 22 December 1986, when she was interviewed by Simon Bates during the promotion of the film \"Shanghai Surprise\". The singer gave subsequent interviews to Jakki Brambles, Bates, Simon Mayo, Sara Cox, Jo Whiley, and Chris Moyles in 1990, 1991, 1994, 2000, 2001, and 2006, respectively. The station also broadcast the Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990 and The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993. On 10 May 2008, Madonna headlined Radio 1's Big Weekend at Mote Park, in Maidstone to promote the release of her album \"Hard Candy\". The first single from the album, \"4 Minutes\" (2008), was added to the station's A-list.\n\nIn 2012, Madonna released her twelfth studio album, \"MDNA\". The lead single, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\", and subsequent releases from the album were not added to the Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, \"I don't think we play Madonna any more. There is a lot of research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [She's] probably not at the top of their list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just have got to keep on top of that.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Radio Academy event in 2014, the station's Head of Music, George Ergatoudis, stated that its audience had \"moved on\" from Madonna, and that the majority of her fans were \"over 30\". He added that the BBC Trust had decided to make Radio 1 as a station appealing to a younger demographic, a factor which determines their daytime playlists.\n\nOn 20 December 2014, Madonna's thirteenth studio album \"Rebel Heart\" became available for pre-order. Unlike other countries, first single \"Living for Love\" was only made available for pre-order in the United Kingdom, and was not chart-eligible until 25 February 2015. On 22 December 2014, \"Living for Love\" started to receive airplay on commercial radio, most notably Capital FM, where the song was eventually added to the station's playlist.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, Annie Mac played \"Living for Love\" on Radio 1 during her evening dance show. In a later interview with \"The Independent\", Mac said that her mission was to \"represent the landscape of new music honestly\", and hoped that older artists such as Madonna should not get excluded from the station. \"I'm a lifelong Madonna fan and I played her on my Friday show. [...] If I'm excited by a song, then I think it's going to be all right to play it\", Mac concluded.\n\nAn article published by the \"Daily Mail\" on 14 February 2015 quoted an unnamed BBC Radio 1 insider who stated that \"Living for Love\" would not be played on the station because Madonna is \"irrelevant\" and \"old\". Radio 1 later denied the claims on their Facebook page, stating that the station \"does not ban anyone\". One of its representatives explained that tracks are chosen on \"musical merit\" and that an artist's age is never a factor when choosing songs for their playlist.\n\nThe \"Daily Mail\" article quickly went viral, and hundreds of messages were left on Radio 1's Facebook page from Madonna's fans urging the station to play \"Living for Love\". Support for the singer soon spread to the station's Twitter and Instagram accounts, with fans posting links to the \"Living for Love\" video, her performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards, and posts claiming that the BBC was being discriminatory.\n\nMadonna received support from artists such as Boy George, Elly Jackson, Diplo and Rita Ora. Shirley Manson wrote on her Twitter account that Madonna should \"contemplate suing Radio 1 for discrimination in the workplace\", and that the station's music policy was \"bordering on, if not actively, unlawful\". The media response to the controversy was generally in support of Madonna, with \"The Sun\"s Dan Wootton criticising Radio 1's decision to not play the track. Describing the station's daytime playlist as the \"Cray List\" in his column, Wootton listed several artists who struggle to receive Radio 1 airplay, including Robbie Williams, Take That, and Meghan Trainor.\n\nMadonna posted a newspaper clipping that featured the story on her Twitter and Instagram accounts, and thanked her fans for their support. In an interview with Wootton in \"The Sun\", the singer called the omission \"unfair\" and \"discriminatory\", and felt that ageism was a taboo that is still not being talked about. She also recalled discussing the incident with her manager Guy Oseary and admitted that it was perplexing for her to learn that artists in their fifties do not get played on radio, without exceptions. \"We've made so many advances in other areas — civil rights, gay rights — but ageism is still an area that's taboo and not talked about and dealt with,\" she concluded.\n\nThe BBC was quick to refute allegations of ageism, and explained that songs were chosen on a case-by-case basis for inclusion on their weekly playlist. Their representative noted that Sir Paul McCartney had two songs on the playlist, although critics pointed out that both of these tracks were collaborations with younger artists (McCartney featured on \"Only One\", with Kanye West, and \"FourFiveSeconds\", with Rihanna). The station further listed David Guetta, the Foo Fighters, and Sia as examples of older artists making their playlist. In an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\", Radio 1's controller Ben Cooper explained that the station has not \"banned\" Madonna, and that a group of twelve 16–24 aged personnel would meet on a regular basis to review the network's musical output, determining the relevant musical choice for their demographic.\n\nIn an interview with the \"Daily Mirror\", Mills defended the station's decision not to play the song. He stated, \"[Radio 1 are] trying to get the average age of the listener down and, to be honest, most Madonna fans are in their 30s and 40s. I don't actually mind the new single, but do I think Radio 1 should play it? Probably not.\" According to the Official Charts Company, \"Living for Love\" moved towards the top-twenty of the UK Singles Chart with two days of available sales as reported in their mid-week chart report. It ultimately debuted at number 26 on the chart with sales of 17,936 copies, becoming Madonna's 71st top-forty single, extending her record as the female artist with the most top-forty UK singles.\n\n"}

She is a member of the Labour Party and has been a Member of Parliament since 1993. Since the , she has represented the electorate.\n\nDyson was born in Lower Hutt. Her father served in the New Zealand Army, and so Dyson's family frequently moved around the country. Dyson joined the Labour Party in Westport in 1979, and worked as a campaign organiser for Labour MP Kerry Burke in the 1981 and 1984 election. In 1985, she moved to Wellington, where she worked with Labour MP Fran Wilde on the Homosexual Law Reform Bill. She worked for Wilde's re-election campaign in the 1987 election, and later held a number of senior offices in the Labour Party, including that of president.\n\nDyson first entered Parliament in the , winning the electorate against National's David Carter. In the , the Lyttelton electorate was abolished, and Dyson stood in , losing to Carter, who had in the meantime become an MP through winning the 1994 Selwyn by-election. She became a list MP owing to her position on the Labour Party's list. In the , however, she defeated Carter to win Banks Peninsula. She has remained the MP for the area since that time; however before the 2008 election the boundaries were changed and it was renamed Port Hills.\n\nWhen the Labour Party won power in the 1999 general election, Dyson was appointed to a number of minor ministerial roles, including Disability Issues and Associate Health and Associate Social Development. However, she resigned them on 31 October 2000 after being caught drink driving. She regained most of her ministerial responsibilities on 4 June 2001.\n\nIn a reshuffle on 31 October 2007, Dyson took on the portfolio of Social Development, which she held until the Clark government lost power at the 2008 general election. Despite the swing against Labour at that election, Dyson won her new electorate of Port Hills with an increased margin than that of Banks Peninsula.\n\nIn December 2009 Dyson's Resource Management (Requiring Authorities) Amendment Bill, which would amend the Resource Management Act 1991 to reintroduce a public interest test for projects seeking requiring authority, was drawn from the member's ballot. The bill was defeated at its first reading.\n\nDyson was re-elected as the MP for Port Hills at the 2011 general election. She is currently the Labour spokesperson for Conservation, Senior Citizens, and Internal Affairs and chairs the Parliamentary Select Committee on Government Administration . When Lianne Dalziel confirmed that she would contest the 2013 Christchurch mayoralty, her Christchurch Earthquake Recovery portfolio was split and assigned to Dyson and Clayton Cosgrove in July 2013.\n\nDyson contested the against Nuk Korako of the National Party and chose not to be placed on Labour's party list. Based on preliminary counts, Dyson has a majority of 1,865 votes over Korako.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Sixth Labour Government in 2017, Dyson was elected Labour's Senior Whip.\n\n"}
{"id": "40248493", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40248493", "title": "Sexism in video gaming", "text": "Sexism in video gaming\n\nSexism in video gaming is prejudiced behavior or discrimination based on sex or gender as experienced by people who play and create video games, primarily women. This may manifest as sexual harassment or in the way genders are represented in games, such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.\n\nThe demographics of video game culture have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s. This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the Gamergate controversy in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.\n\nHarassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests. In some cases, female players are also stalked, whether online or offline.\n\nWomen are sometimes marginalized as \"intruders\", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as the Sims, music video games or casual games. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing \"girl games\" or disliking violent games. As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or game developers, even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game. Since the release of the NES, video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men. In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads. Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\nAccording to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion. In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to \"meetings\" that were actually romantic dates.\n\nSexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.\n\nVideo games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as 'booth babes', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.\n\nInsults are frequent in online gaming. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service Xbox Live), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment. However, data from Riot Games lists racism and homophobia at the top. Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.\n\nIn 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing Halo 3 online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile. A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers. The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males \"attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank.\"\n\nA study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words \"gay\" or \"queer\" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as \"somewhat hostile\" while 14% perceived it as \"very hostile\".\n\nAccording to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should \"return to the kitchen\", along with other slurs. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.\n\nCritics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.\n\nEvents in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States, United Kingdom and Germany:\n\n\n\nA study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the Proteus effect, manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a virtual reality game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher rape myth acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that blame the victim, and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased self-objectification. When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.\n\nIn 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.\n\nIn another study, 181 students from a private liberal arts college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to control group), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance. A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.\n\nKaren E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely. Theories such as the cultivation theory, social cognitive theory, ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media. These theories also illustrate the ways prominent video game characters are gendered and what is received by the user or viewer. They write that \"Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens.\"\n\nAccording to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player. On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as \"hi everybody\" or \"alright team let's do this\" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.\n\nIn 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres. The longitudinal study was based on cultivation theory, and the results broadly showed that playing video games did not lead to gamers becoming sexist. The authors Johannes Breuer, Rachel Kowert, Ruth Festl and Thorsten Quandt have, however, been keen \"to make clear that [their] study does not show that sexism is not an issue in/for games and gaming culture. There are many content analyses of popular games that show that female characters are underrepresented or presented in an overly sexualized manner and there is also ample evidence that many players, particularly female, have experienced sexism in their interactions with other players.\"\n\nA study published in May 2016 investigated the common perception of a gender performance gap. The researchers analysed the performance data of over 10,000 players (both men and women) in the online MMORPGs \"Everquest II\" in the United States and \"Chevaliers III\" in China. The study contends that \"perceived gender-based performance disparities seem to result from factors that are confounded with gender (i.e., amount of play), not player gender itself\". Lead author Cuihai Shen stated that if there was a gender disparity favoring men then \"they should advance to higher levels within the same amount of play time\" however their analysis indicated \"women advanced at least as fast as men did in both games\". Shen outlined that there was a difference in play style between the genders, and stated \"women did spend less time playing overall than men, they chose characters that are more assistive, and were more drawn to social interaction and helping others.\n\nA study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was \"Grand Theft Auto\". Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was \"Half Life 1\" and \"Half Life 2\". Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was \"Dream Pinball 3D\" and \"Q.U.B.E. 2\", which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, \"not at all\" to 7, \"very much\". The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, \"Grand Theft Auto\", showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. \"The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls. Exposure to sex-typed media characters can have real world consequence.\"\n\nFemale activists actively promote changes in the way women are portrayed in games and how they are treated by the industry and gaming public as a whole. Media critic Anita Sarkeesian, for example, has – through her organization Feminist Frequency – given lectures and training to help change gaming culture. \n\nA prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of TIGA, \"typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low. There is only a comparatively small pool of potential female employees available to work in the games industry.\"\n\nInitiatives on the part of gaming companies include codes of conduct and the adoption of trainings and standards to ensure safe and respectful workplace. In an attempt to combat sexism, the French government in 2016 proposed pieces of legislation that would give bonuses or incentives to video game creators that promote a more positive image of female characters in their games. Furthermore, these proposals outline a rating system that distinguishes games that promote a positive female representation and those that do not, with the latter getting the highest age 18 rating.\n\n"}
{"id": "46335567", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46335567", "title": "Simcoe Pride", "text": "Simcoe Pride\n\nFierté Simcoe Pride is an annual festival held in Simcoe County, Ontario, during the end of July and beginning of August each year. It is a celebration of the diversity of the LGBT community in Simcoe County. It is one of the larger regional gay pride festivals in Canada, featuring flag raisings and proclamations from across the County, educational events, artistic and cultural events, and a large signature closing event. Since forming, the organisation has expanded gradually, involving more year round events. In 2016, the organisation celebrated its fifth anniversary Pride.\n\nPride Week and year-round events are run by Fierté Simcoe Pride, a not-for-profit, volunteer-run organisation. The mission of Fierté Simcoe Pride is to \"create and offer inclusive events, services, and educational opportunities that rise above heterosexism, hetero-normativity and homo/bi/transphobia, promoting safe communities within Simcoe County.\" \n\nThe organisation also uses a list of objectives and values as guidelines.\n\nFierté Simcoe Pride is managed by a volunteer Board of Directors, who handle the finances, logistics and operations of the organisation and events. They also oversee the long-term vision, objectives and values. In addition, volunteers are involved in running the events.\n\nThe events are funded through donations, sponsorships, in-kind support, and fundraisers.\n\nOrganizing for the LGBT community in Simcoe County has been traced back to the mid 1980s/early 1990s with faith-based communities, various community-based committees, social groups and school-based supports.\n\nThese community based supports either relied on fundraising from a small pool of supporters, were offered for a fee or were sponsored through an organization. With a lack of sustainability, many of these supports no longer exist or have evolved into different resources like those offered by Rainbow Health Ontario and programming provided by the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County.\n\nIn 1984, the Gays and Lesbians Alliance of Simcoe County (GLAS) formed and ran until 2001. They held a cruise on the Serendipity Princess from 1996 to 2000, subsequently the boat cruise was run by: The Spot (bar) in 2001 and 2002, Club C'est La Vie from 2003 to 2005, Dusty's Den in 2006 and 2007, and Club Chill Events in 2008.\n\nThe Simcoe County Metropolitan Community Church (SCMCC), led by Reverend Carol Galbraith founded in the early '90s, around 1993, and advocated for the LGBT community as well as the legalization of Same-sex marriage in Canada. It also provided support to the community and each year held a banquet and awards ceremony to honour people and organizations who supported and advocated for the lesbian, gay, bisexual an transgender community the region. The congregation met at Grove Street United Church and existed until the mid to late 2000s.\n\nThe Holding On through Peer Education (H.O.P.E.) Theatre Troupe (through the ACSC, now the Gilbert Centre) was a program that had some success with securing funding in the late 1990s, however it was limited. Although not an LGBT specific program, LGBT youth found it to be a safe space. In the early 2000s the program was no longer sustainable due to lack of funding. The LGBT Youth Drop-In, a sponsored program of the AIDS Committee of Simcoe County had success in the early 2000s although the program depended on community fundraisers and in-kind donations. Eventually this program could no longer sustain itself.\n\nIn 2011 two Ryerson University students identified a need to support LGBT youth in Simcoe County. They started the LGBT Youth Connection with their own resources and support of other organizations. The program is still running, and has expanded from Barrie into other parts of the county.\n\nIn 2003, Huronia Transition Homes formed the Diversity Committee and ran the Opening Closets conference, which took place every other year. They eventually renamed themselves the Opening Closets Conference Committee. The conference was an opportunity to inform and train a variety of workers on sexual diversity and LGBT issues. In 2009 the Opening Closets conference had a particular focus on LGBT youth. This committee has been, to the best of knowledge, non-active since 2010.\n\nIn May 2002, PFLAG Barrie formed, running meetings to support for families, allies and people who are LGBT. The group struggled for several year, and had different people run it, until October 2008 when a dedicated family took it over. To the best of knowledge, the group has been inactive since 2011.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2005 a Pride week was run by the Simcoe County Pride Committee with the main events taking place in Barrie, Ontario, as well as support from Midland, Ontario, Penetanguishene, Bradford West Gwillimbury and Orillia.\n\nIn 2008, LGBTA Barrie formed (formalizing in 2009), holding fundraisers and bar events at Memories. They also did a flag raising in 2008 to honour International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT) and ran a pride week in August 2008 and 2009.\n\nOnce Simcoe Pride formed, the Board decided to hold Simcoe Pride Week in or around the month of August (as opposed to during June, the popular month to hold Pride events) to honour the past pride events that existed in the County.\n\nThe Georgian LGBTQA Association of Georgian College formed in 2009, holding a flag raising at the Barrie Campus. It has since rebranded twice, now operating under the name of Georgian Pride. In March of that year they held a World Café in partnership with Rainbow Health Ontario (RHO). After this conference, several organizations and events formed, such as Muskoka Pride (first as a picnic, then a committee in 2010), the Simcoe County LGBTQ Network, and the Safety and Equity Conference.\n\nIn 2010 the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation District 17 Human Rights Committee organized their first conference for students who participated in their Gay-Straight Alliances (GSAs). The conferences was organized in 2010 and 2011 to support students through educational and leadership development.\n\nA pride week and flag raising were held in Barrie in 2010 from August 23 to 27 by LGBTA Barrie, with events and a boat cruise organized by Club C'est La Vie and community members.\n\nIn 2014, Barrie Pride formed, holding a successful first pride week and first pride parade in the second week of June. Barrie Pride was again held in June 2015, 2016, and 2017.\n\nSimcoe Pride was founded on May 13, 2012 with a small committee of volunteers. Much like past pride groups, the committee started off will small fundraisers, such as dances, drag shows and brunches. However, the founders made it clear that it would be a \"lasting force\" in the community.\n\nThe inaugural Simcoe Pride Week run by Simcoe Pride, which was planned in under three months, was held in 2012 from August 3 to 11. With the exception of one event, the dusk till dawn movie night in Oro-Medonte, this pride week was all hosted in Barrie. No boat cruise was held that year, due to limited resources. However, they did have a flag raising, spiritual service/blessing, candlelight vigil and march, a community art show and silent auction, and ended the week with a family fun fair and pride prom.\n\nFollowing the inaugural festival, Simcoe Pride began planning for pride week 2013, which took place from August 2 to 10. Simcoe Pride Week 2013 was larger than the year before, with eight days of events spread over nine days. In addition to hosting the first annual boat cruise, that did not happen the year before, the pride week (and its flag raisings) expanded from Barrie to other communities in the county, including Ramara, Oro-Medonte, New Tecumseth , Orillia, Innisfil, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Midland and Penetanguishene. Other events included Saturday a family fun fair, dusk till dawn movie night, candle light vigil, 'Make It Safe' march, community art show and silent Auction, and all-ages semi-formal and close-off party.\n\nThe march, named 'Make It Safe', was held in response of an act of violence against a community member who was targeted and assaulted. Though violence and discrimination toward LGBT people is not unheard of, any victims are afraid to speak out. Although the march was planned earlier, organizers changed the name to reflect the violent attack as well as to raise awareness about other issues LGBT individuals face.\n\nThe following year, Simcoe Pride Week was held from July 31 to August 9, 2014. This pride week was a considerably large festival in comparison to the past prides, this is because the week had support from the county and the largest amount of municipalities yet, with flag raisings at the County of Simcoe, and in Barrie, Orillia, Bradford West Gwillimbury, Ramara, Innisfil, Wasaga Beach, Chippewas of Rama First Nation, New Tecumseth, Midland, Penetanguishene, Clearview, and Oro Medonte. With the exception of Clearview, all also proclaimed pride along with Severn and Adjala–Tosorontio. Collingwood, which has a policy against flag raisings and proclamations, did promote the festival on their website as a way to provide recognition.\n\nEssa, Springwater, Tay, and Tiny did not participate; Beausoleil First Nation did not reply and Canadian Forces Base Borden was not sent a request.\n\nAs well as the growth in municipal support, the festival had more events across the county garnering over a thousand in attendance during the week and 2,500 attendees at year round events according to festival organizers.\n\nFierté Simcoe Pride 2015 was held from July 30 to August 8. With the continued growth of support from community members, municipalities and media, there was an increased efforts to get the rest of the County to participate in Fierté Simcoe Pride.\n\nIn January 2015, the decision to fly the pride flag in Clearview was stalled at a Council meeting. The Township had a policy against issuing proclamations in support of organizations, and usually didn't raise flags either but in 2014, an exception was made and council agreed to fly the pride flag at the municipal office for the first time. Councillor Robert Walker me the request opposition saying that in his Christian belief he would not be supporting it.\nAt a Council meeting later in January, residents spoke in support of raising the flag and urged Council to review its policy. After pressure from local residents and the attention of local, nation and international Pride organizations - including York Region Pride, Fierté Canada Pride and InterPride - Clearview Council reviewed its policy at the April 13 meeting and ruled in favour of issuing proclamations. Clearview has currently not approved to raise the flag due to the availability of flagpoles and flag etiquette, however Simcoe Pride is working with the township to find an appropriate place to raise the flag.\n\nIn January 2015, Tiny Township decided 4-1 to proclaim Simcoe Pride Week 2015. They also requested a flag raising. The motion revised a resolution passed in March 2007, to the effect that the Franco-Ontario flag would be raised each year during Francophone Week, but that requests for other declarations and flag raisings would not be accepted. This Council decided to consider such requests case by case.\n\nIn 2015 there was 16 proclamations, 14 flag raisings, and one banner unveiling at Orillia Soldiers' Memorial Hospital. Tay, Springwater and Essa, did not participate; Canadian Forces Base Borden was sent a request but was unable to participate, and Collingwood maintained a no flag raising and no proclamation policy but supports pride in other ways.\n\nAs of 2015, an annual theme is selected for each Pride Week that reflects the current context of the queer community in the region and helps shape the festivities, the inaugural theme being \"Freedom To Be.\"\n\nFierté Simcoe Pride 2016 was held from July 27 to August 6, 2016, under the theme \"Celebrate.\" This also marked the fifth anniversary of the festival. The festival saw a record amount of support from communities, with 20 of the 22 communities within Simcoe County proclaiming Pride or holding a flag raising. This included first ever Pride flag raisings in Tay, Essa, Collingwood, and Canadian Forces Base Borden.\n\nOn June 8, 2016, it was announced that a Trans Pride March would be held during the fifth annual festivities in Orillia. Other prominent additions to the Pride festivities included the production of a \"Pride Guide,\" a guide that will included ads from inclusive businesses and services in the region as well as an events list, and an affiliate events program.\n\nOn July 6, 2016, the Township of Springwater discussed waiving their procedural by-law that states that \"the Township of Springwater shall not consider proclamations or resolutions dealing with matters outside its sphere of jurisdiction\" to allow for a proclamation and/or flag raising. Council voted to receive the report from the Chief Administrative Office, and voted in a recorded 5-1 vote to not waive the by-law.\n\n"}

It serves as the 11th episode of the ninth season and the 189th overall episode. The animation directors were the supervising director, Alan Smart and Tom Yasumi, and was written by Marc Ceccarelli, Luke Brookshier, and Mr. Lawrence. Ceccarelli and Brookshier also served as storyboard directors. The episode originally aired in Greece on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it aired on Nickelodeon on November 11. In this episode of the series, which follows the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob gets fired from the Krusty Krab after Mr. Krabs discovers he can save a nickel by eliminating him. SpongeBob subsequently decides to apply at other restaurants.\n\n\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\" was first screened at the 2013 San Diego Comic-Con International. Prior to broadcast on television, the episode created a level of controversy for its depiction of unemployment. It eventually sparked a political debate when Media Matters for America and Al Sharpton of MSNBC accused both the \"New York Post\" and Fox News of using the episode \"to slam poor people who use social services\". The premiere of \"SpongeBob, You're Fired\" drew 5.2 million viewers, the biggest audience viewership for a \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode in two years since \"Frozen Face-Off\" in July 2011.\n\nSpongeBob is going about his usual day at work at the Krusty Krab. All of a sudden, his employer, Mr. Krabs, fires him from his job as a fry cook. According to Mr. Krabs, he can save a nickel if he cuts SpongeBob's salary completely. SpongeBob offers to work for free, which Mr. Krabs says he considered but learned it would be illegal and that he could lose his vending license. Squidward Tentacles, SpongeBob's apathetic co-worker, asks if he can be fired as well, but Mr. Krabs refuses because Squidward has more seniority. SpongeBob cries in depression all the way home. Squidward, although gleeful over SpongeBob not working at the Krusty Krab anymore, asks Mr. Krabs who will be the new fry cook. His boss informs him that, to save money, he will take over the kitchen, much to Squidward's dismay.\n\nAt home, SpongeBob, still distraught, explains the situation to his best friend and neighbor Patrick. Patrick, however, tells him that being unemployed is \"the best gig I know\" and promises to return in the morning to introduce SpongeBob to \"the unemployed lifestyle.\" The next morning, the two friends meet up and start SpongeBob's first day of \"glorious unemployment,\" or as Patrick likes to call it, \"Fun Employment.\" Patrick shows SpongeBob the following activities: 1.) Going to Squidward's garden and getting him to throw vegetables at them after ruining some of his flowers, 2.) Taking a \"siesta\" and 3.) Having a free lunch with friends at Sandy Cheeks' tree dome. Sandy, who is carrying out an experiment in nutrition, is surprised to see SpongeBob there and tells SpongeBob that he should find a new job after she learns he was fired. Deciding that Sandy is right, SpongeBob thanks Patrick for trying to help him but points out that, while unemployment might be fun for him, SpongeBob needs a job. Patrick is fine with this and tells his best friend that he should do what he feels is right.\n\nOver the next few days, SpongeBob tries getting a job at a hot dog joint, a pizzeria, a taqueria, and finally an Asian noodle house. He is fired each time for making a type of patty (\"weenie patties,\" a \"pizza patty,\" a \"burrito patty\" and a \"noodle patty\" respectively) instead of what each respective restaurant itself specializes in. After being dismissed from the noodle house, SpongeBob goes home and prepares some homemade pet food for Gary, noticing that they're out of store bought food. Gary loves the food, but the gluttonous Patrick shares it. Eventually, the doorbell rings, and SpongeBob answers, but he is stashed into a body bag shaped like a hot dog bun and taken back to the hot dog joint, where he is forced to work because, surprisingly, the customers loved the weenie patties that SpongeBob created. Soon, all four of the restaurant managers who fired SpongeBob before are fighting over him because their customers loved the patty creations he made.\n\nA mysterious person in a Krabby Patty costume arrives, defeats all four of the restaurant managers, saves SpongeBob, and takes him back to the Krusty Krab, which has faltered ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume and explains that, as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again. Mr. Krabs admits that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs installs a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.\n\nOn July 21, 2013, Tom Kenny presented an event called \"SpongeCon 2013: The Year of the Fan\" at the San Diego Comic-Con International 2013. The event hosted the official and exclusive sneak preview of \"SpongeBob, You're Fired\" and the screening of the SpongeBob SquareShorts global short film competition finalists. Prior to the official preview, a sneak peek of the episode was featured on \"Nick Studio 10\", hosted by Noah Grossman and Gabrielle \"Gabby\" Senn, on June 10, 2013. A \"SpongeBob expert\" named Sophia said that \"the unthinkable [will] happen to SpongeBob [in this episode]\". She remarked that the episode is \"pretty top secret\".\n\nIn an October 30, 2013 article of the \"New York Post\", it was first reported that \"SpongeBob, You're Fired\" would air on Nickelodeon in the United States on November 11, 2013.\n\nAs part of the marketing campaign for the episode, Nickelodeon debuted an online game of the same name. Beginning November 6, players could visit \"nick.com/spongebob\" to play the game. In the gameplay, players must accurately cook the orders of the diners while juggling each server's impatience level in order to keep them \"happy as possible\". Furthermore, Nickelodeon published a collection called \"SpongeBob SquarePants: Get to Work!\" on iTunes. On November 6, Nickelodeon debuted the full-length trailer of the episode to garner more exposure. Earlier that day, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" exclusively debuted the 45-second teaser. The source also released in advance an exclusive 90-second trailer of the episode, featuring SpongeBob getting the ax from Mr. Krabs, on November 4.\n\n\"SpongeBob, You're Fired\" first aired on Nickelodeon (Greece) on July 3, 2013. In the United States, it premiered on November 11. The original U.S. airing of the episode on Nickelodeon brought in the biggest audience viewership for a \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" episode in two years, with 5.186 million households tuning in overall. The episode tied with CBS' \"Hostages\", the \"poorest performer\", from the \"Big Four\" of the night. However, across cable, the show outperformed \"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" (0.8 adults), \"Teen Mom\" (0.7 adults) and \"The Daily Show\" (0.6 adults). The broadcast was the second most viewed show among all the day's cable programs (a \"Monday Night Football\" contest between the Miami Dolphins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers on ESPN came first). The episode topped the 2–11, 6–11 and 9–14 in the kids demographics.\n\nThe episode was criticized for dialogue referencing the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Food Stamps benefit). In a scene from the episode, Patrick Star tries to show SpongeBob \"the benefits of being unemployed\", to which SpongeBob replies, \"Unemployment may be fun for you, but I need to get a job.\" The scene was meant to demonstrate the title character's \"eternal optimism and willingness to get back to work...in a way that's still funny and relatable\". However, some political activists claimed the \"notorious line\" was a \"slam\" to the Food Stamps benefit. A report by \"The Hollywood Reporter\" alleged that the episode may have had a political agenda about the social safety net. It added that \"It's not the first time SpongeBob has waded into social commentary, though usually when it does, it bugs the right and supports the left.\" \"The Hollywood Reporter\" cited the previous episodes \"SpongeBob's Last Stand\" and \"Selling Out\" for where \"environmentalism is glorified\" and \"large businesses are demonized\".\n\nAccording to various sources, the story line is said to be \"symbolic of a harsh economic climate\". The plot eventually sparked a political debate for its depiction of unemployment. Prior to the premiere, the \"New York Post\" published an article on the episode. Critics accused the author, Andrea Morabito, of attacking \"poor people\" who rely on government assistance, referring to individuals who rely on food stamps as \"mooching off the social services\" and applauding SpongeBob for instead quickly returning to \"gainful employment\". Fox News's Heather Nauert of \"Fox & Friends\" stated that \"the harsh economic climate has hit the underwater community\", but \"instead of mooching off social services at Bikini Bottom...SpongeBob sets out to return to the work force\".\n\nAfter the \"New York Post\" and Fox News commented on the episode, Media Matters for America, a politically progressive media watchdog group, responded. The group accused the media sources, both owned by News Corporation, of using the episode \"to slam poor people who use social services\". In response to Fox News, Media Matters immediately posted an item online titled \"Right-Wing Media Use SpongeBob SquarePants' Firing To Attack Social Safety Net\", arguing that the two \"are using the firing of fictional cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants to attack the social safety net and those who rely on it\". Media Matters was \"also particularly bothered by [a] line from \"The Post\" story: 'Lest he sit around idly, mooching off the social services of Bikini Bottom, a depressed SpongeBob sets out to return to gainful employment wherever he can find it', reporter Andrea Morabito wrote. 'No spoilers—but it's safe to say that our hero doesn't end up on food stamps, as his patty-making skills turn out to be in high demand.'\"\n\nCivil rights activist and talk show host Al Sharpton of MSNBC remarked in the October 31 episode of \"PoliticsNation\" that \"The right-wingers found a new hero in its war against the poor [...] SpongeBob SquarePants. That's right. SpongeBob SquarePants [...] So a sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea doesn't need government help. That means no one does?\"\n\nNickelodeon declined to comment on the issue caused by the message of the episode. However, Russell Hicks of Nickelodeon said the show is \"tapping into the news of the moment, but did not specifically address any political leanings or ideologies within the episode.\" In a statement, Hicks said \"Like all really great cartoons, part of SpongeBob's long-running success has been its ability to tap into the zeitgeist while still being really funny for our audience. As always, despite this momentary setback, SpongeBob's eternal optimism prevails, which is always a great message for everyone.\"\n\nNickelodeon and Random House released a book based on the episode called \"You're Fired!\". The book is illustrated by David Aikins and was released on January 7, 2014. \"SpongeBob, You're Fired!\" was released on a DVD compilation of the same name on April 29, 2014 by Nickelodeon and Paramount Home Entertainment. The DVD includes the episode itself, \"Neptune's Spatula\", \"Welcome to the Chum Bucket\", \"The Original Fry Cook\", \"Le Big Switch\", \"Model Sponge\", \"Employee of the Month\", \"Bossy Boots\", \"Krusty Dogs\", \"License to Milkshake\", \"Help Wanted\", \"Wet Painters\", \"Krusty Krab Training Video\", and \"Pizza Delivery\". On October 10, 2017, \"SpongeBob, You're Fired!\" was released on the \"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Complete Ninth Season\" DVD, alongside all episodes of the ninth season.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "358694", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358694", "title": "State Opening of Parliament", "text": "State Opening of Parliament\n\nThe State Opening of Parliament is an event which formally marks the beginning of a session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It includes a speech from the throne known as the Queen's Speech (or the King's Speech). The State Opening is an elaborate ceremony showcasing British history, culture and contemporary politics to large crowds and television viewers.\n\nIt takes place in the House of Lords chamber, usually in May or June, but traditionally in November, in front of both Houses of Parliament. The monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, reads a speech that has been prepared by his or her government outlining its plans for that parliamentary year. A State Opening may take place at other times of the year if an election is held early due to a vote of no confidence in the government. In 1974, when two general elections were held, there were two State Openings.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II has opened every session of Parliament since her accession, except in 1959 and 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Andrew and Prince Edward respectively. Those two sessions were opened by Lords Commissioners, headed by the Archbishop of Canterbury (Geoffrey Fisher in 1959 and Michael Ramsey in 1963), empowered by the Queen. The Lord Chancellor (Viscount Kilmuir in 1959 and Lord Dilhorne in 1963) read the Queen's Speech on those occasions.\n\nThe State Opening of Parliament is a ceremony loaded with historical ritual and symbolic significance for the governance of the United Kingdom. In one place are assembled the members of all three branches of government, of which the Monarch is the authority and nominal head in each part: the Crown-in-Parliament, (the Queen, together with the House of Commons and the House of Lords), constitutes the legislature; the Queen-in-Council, Her Majesty's Ministers (who are members of one or other House, and members of Her Majesty's Privy Council) constitute the executive; the Queen-on-the-Bench, consisting of Her Majesty's Judges, although not members of either House, are summoned to attend and represent the judiciary. Therefore, the State Opening demonstrates the governance of the United Kingdom but also the separation of powers. The importance of international relations is also represented through the presence in the Chamber of the \"corps diplomatique\".\n\nThe ceremonial surrounding the opening of parliament can be broken down into several parts:\n\nFirst, the cellars of the Palace of Westminster are searched by the Yeomen of the Guard in order to prevent a modern-day Gunpowder Plot. The Plot of 1605 involved a failed attempt by a group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the Protestant King James I and aristocracy. Since that year, the cellars have been searched, now largely, but not only, for ceremonial purposes. This is supervised by the Lord Great Chamberlain, and the Yeomen are paid for their services with a small glass of port wine.\n\nThe peers assemble in the House of Lords wearing their robes. They are joined by senior representatives of the judiciary and members of the diplomatic corps. The Commons assemble in their own chamber, wearing ordinary day dress, and begin the day, as any other, with prayers. The Speaker of the House of Commons makes his usual procession towards the Commons Chamber, accompanied by his Household, the Mace, and a police inspector who makes a traditional cry of \"Hats off, strangers.\" This commands those in Central Lobby to remove their hats in deference to the highest-ranking commoner in the realm.\n\nBefore the monarch departs from Buckingham Palace the Treasurer, Comptroller and Vice-Chamberlain of the Queen's Household (all of whom are Government whips) deliver ceremonial white staves to her. The Lord Chamberlain, on behalf of the monarch, keeps the hostage MP (usually the Vice-Chamberlain) \"prisoner\" for the duration of the state opening, by tradition as a surety for the safe return of the monarch. The hostage MP is well entertained until the successful conclusion of the ceremony, when he or she is released upon the safe return of the Queen. The Vice-Chamberlain's imprisonment is now purely ceremonial, though he does remain under guard; originally, it guaranteed the safety of the Sovereign as he or she entered a possibly hostile Parliament. The tradition stems from the time of Charles I, who had a contentious relationship with Parliament and was eventually beheaded in 1649 during the Civil War between the monarchy and Parliament. A copy of Charles I's death warrant is displayed in the robing room used by the monarch as a ceremonial reminder of what can happen to a monarch who attempts to interfere with Parliament.\n\nHostage MPs have included:\n\nBefore the arrival of the sovereign, the Imperial State Crown is carried to the Palace of Westminster in its own State Coach ( the Australian State Coach). From the Victoria Tower, the Crown is passed by the sovereign's Bargemaster to the Comptroller of the Lord Chamberlain's office, under the watchful eye of the Crown Jeweller. It is then carried, along with the Great Sword of State and the Cap of Maintenance, to be displayed in the Royal Gallery. Also brought in this procession, usually in King Edward VII's Town Coach, are two maces, separate from the three used by parliament, to be displayed by the Sergeants-at-Arms in the Royal Procession.\n\nThe monarch arrives at the Palace of Westminster from Buckingham Palace in a state coach (since 2014, the Diamond Jubilee State Coach), entering through the Sovereign's Entrance under the Victoria Tower; the monarch is usually accompanied by his or her consort and sometimes by other members of the royal family. Members of the armed forces line the procession route from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster. As the national anthem is played, the Royal Standard is hoisted to replace the Union Flag upon the Sovereign's entrance and remains flying whilst she is present. Then, after he or she takes on the Parliament Robe of State and Imperial State Crown in the Robing Chamber, the monarch proceeds through the Royal Gallery to the House of Lords, usually accompanied by his or her consort and immediately preceded by the Earl Marshal, and by one peer (usually the Leader of the House of Lords) carrying the Cap of Maintenance on a white rod, and another peer (generally a retired senior military officer) carrying the Great Sword of State, all following the Lord Great Chamberlain and his white stick, commonly the practical implement of ceremonial ushers, raised aloft. Once seated on the throne, the monarch, wearing the Imperial State Crown, instructs the House by saying, \"My Lords, pray be seated\"; her consort takes his seat on the throne to her left and other members of the royal family may be seated elsewhere on the dais (for instance the Prince of Wales may be seated on a chair of state on a lower portion of the dais to the monarch's right.)\n\nMotioned by the monarch, the Lord Great Chamberlain raises his wand of office to signal to the Gentleman/Lady Usher of the Black Rod (known as Black Rod), who is charged with summoning the House of Commons and has been waiting in the Central Lobby. Black Rod turns and, under the escort of the Door-keeper of the House of Lords and a police inspector, proceeds to the Members' Lobby of the House of Commons, and reaches the doors of the Commons.\nIn 1642, King Charles I stormed into the House of Commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the Five Members, who included the celebrated English patriot and leading parliamentarian John Hampden. Since that time, no British monarch has entered the House of Commons when it is sitting.\n\nOn Black Rod's approach, the Doorkeeper of the Commons orders that the doors are slammed shut against him, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch. The Usher of the Black Rod then strikes with the end of his ceremonial staff (the Black Rod) three times on the closed doors of the Commons Chamber, and is then admitted. (There is a mark on the door of the Commons showing the repeated indentations made by Black Rods over the years.) The Sergeant-at-Arms introduces Black Rod. At the bar, Black Rod bows to the Speaker before proceeding to the table, bowing again, and announcing the command of the monarch for the attendance of the Commons, in the following words:\nMr [or Madam] Speaker, The Queen commands this honourable House [pauses to bow to both sides of the House] to attend Her Majesty immediately in the House of Peers.\nA tradition has developed in recent years for this command to be greeted with a defiant topical comment by republican-leaning Labour MP Dennis Skinner, upon which, with some mirth, the House rises to make their way to the Lords' Chamber. This customary intervention was omitted by Mr Skinner in 2015, claiming that he had \"bigger fish to fry than uttering something\", due to a dispute over seating with the Scottish Nationalists. Skinner resumed the practice in 2016.\n\nThe Speaker proceeds to attend the summons at once. The Sergeant-at-Arms picks up the ceremonial mace and, with the Speaker and Black Rod, leads the Members of the House of Commons as they walk, in pairs, towards the House of Lords. By custom, the members saunter, with much discussion and joking, rather than formally process. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition followed by The Deputy Prime Minister, First Secretary of State or another member of the government and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition usually walk side by side, leading the two lines of MPs. The Commons then arrive at the Bar of the House of Lords. The only people required to bow are the House of Commons Speaker, Commons Clerk, senior Lords official Black Rod and the Sergeant-at-Arms. No person who is not a member of the Upper House may pass the Bar unbidden when it is in session; a similar rule applies to the Commons. They remain standing at the Bar during the speech.\n\nThe monarch reads a prepared speech, known as the \"Speech from the Throne\" or the \"Queen's Speech\", outlining the Government's agenda for the coming year. The speech is written by the Prime Minister and their cabinet members, and reflects the legislative agenda for which the Government seeks the agreement of both Houses of Parliament. It is traditionally written on goatskin vellum, and presented on bended knee for the monarch to read by the Lord Chancellor, who produces the scroll from a satchel-like bag. Traditionally, rather than turning his back on the Sovereign, which might appear disrespectful, the Lord Chancellor walks backwards down the steps of the throne, continuing to face the monarch. Lord Irvine of Lairg, the Lord Chancellor at the time, sought to break the custom and applied successfully for permission to turn his back on the sovereign and walk down the steps forwards. The next Lord Chancellor, Jack Straw, continued the former tradition but succeeding Lord Chancellors have chosen to walk forwards.\n\nThe whole speech is addressed to \"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons\", with one significant exception that the monarch says specifically, \"Members of the House of Commons, estimates for the public services will be laid before you\", since the budget is constitutionally reserved to the Commons.\n\nThe monarch reads the entire speech in a neutral and formal tone, implying neither approval nor disapproval of the proposals of Her Government: the monarch makes constant reference to \"My Government\" when reading the text. After listing the main bills to be introduced during the session, the monarch states: \"Other measures will be laid before you\", thus leaving the government scope to introduce bills not mentioned in the speech. The monarch mentions any state visits that she intends to make and also any planned state visits of foreign heads of state to the United Kingdom during the parliamentary session. The monarch concludes the speech in saying:\n\"My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, I pray that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon your counsels\". \nTraditionally, the members of both houses of Parliament listen to the speech respectfully, neither applauding nor showing dissent towards its contents before it is debated in each house. This silence, however, was broken in 1998, when Queen Elizabeth II announced the government's plan of abolishing the right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords. A few Labour members of the House of Commons cried \"yes\" and \"hear\", prompting several of the Lords to shout \"no\" and \"shame\". The Queen continued delivering her speech without any pause, ignoring the intervention. The conduct of those who interrupted the speech was strongly criticised at the time.\n\nFollowing the speech, the monarch and his or her retinue leave the chamber. The monarch bows to both sides of the House of Peers and then leaves the chamber, in the reverse order of the usual procession, before the Commons bow again and return to their Chamber.\n\nAfter the departure of the Queen from the palace, each Chamber proceeds to the consideration of an \"Address in Reply to Her Majesty's Gracious Speech.\" But first, each House considers a bill \"pro forma\" to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. In the House of Lords, the bill is called the Select Vestries Bill, while the Commons equivalent is the Outlawries Bill. The bills are considered for the sake of ceremony only, and do not make any actual legislative progress. For the address in reply, a chosen member moves \"That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty, as follows\". The following is the form used in the House of Lords and is nearly identical to that used in the House of Commons:\nThe first speech of the debate in the Commons is, by tradition, a humorous one given by a member selected in advance. The consideration of the address in reply to the Throne Speech is the occasion for a debate on the Government's agenda. The debate on the Address in Reply is spread over several days. On each day, a different topic, such as foreign affairs or finance, is considered. The debate provides an indication of the views of Parliament regarding the government's agenda.\n\nFollowing this debate, a vote is taken on the Government Programme. If the Government loses the vote, it is considered to be a vote of no confidence.\n\nOn two occasions, in 1974 and 2017, the State Opening has been conducted in a \"dressed-down\" manner, due to the snap general elections held in those years. This form of ceremony has been marked by several changes. Most noticeably, the Queen attended in a hat and morning dress, rather than the traditional crown, ball gown, and robe of state. The Imperial State Crown is carried in front of the Queen, in the same manner as the Sword of State and Cap of Maintenance. Also, no carriages or coaches are used, and the Queen arrives at Westminster by motorcar. There is no military escort in the streets for this procession. Finally, certain personages, such as Heralds and Officers of Arms, are not in attendance at the ceremony. Other than these changes, the ceremony remains largely the same.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century (including in wartime) the State Opening took place on an annual basis, with the following exceptions:\nAfter 1925, the State Opening invariably took place every year (and twice in 1974 - see above) until 2010, since when the government has twice cancelled the event: \nThe 2011 cancellation was criticised as having been 'driven not by any coherent philosophy about constitutional change but by short-term, narrow party interests'.\n\nThe Opening of Parliament began out of practical necessity. By the late 14th century, the manner in which the King gathered his nobles and representatives of the Commons had begun to follow an established pattern. First of all, Peers' names were checked against the list of those who had been summoned, and representatives of the Commons were checked against the sheriffs' election returns. The Peers were robed and sat in the Painted Chamber at Westminster; the Commons were summoned, and stood at the Bar (threshold) of the Chamber. A speech or sermon was then given (usually by the Lord Chancellor) explaining why Parliament had been summoned, after which the Lords and Commons went separately to discuss the business in hand. The monarch normally presided, not only for the Opening but also for the deliberations which followed (unless prevented by illness or other pressing matters).\n\nIn the Tudor period, the modern structure of Parliament began to emerge, and the monarch no longer attended during normal proceedings. For this reason, the State Opening took on greater symbolic significance as an occasion for the full constitution of the State (Monarch, Lords and Commons) to be seen. In this period, the parliamentary gathering began to be preceded by an open-air State Procession (which often attracted large numbers of onlookers): the Monarch, together with Household retinue, would proceed in State from whichever royal residence was being used, first to Westminster Abbey for a service (usually a Mass of the Holy Ghost, prior to the Reformation), and thence on foot (accompanied by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in their robes) to the Palace of Westminster for the Opening itself.\n\nThe Wriothesley Garter Book, a 1523 illustration by Sir Thomas Wriothesley, depicts King Henry VIII seated in Parliament in that year. It shows a remarkable visual similarity between State Openings of the 16th and 21st centuries. In both cases, the monarch sits on a throne before the Cloth of Estate, crowned and wearing a crimson robe of state; at his right hand sit Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor, with arms above under a cardinal's hat, and William Warham, Archbishop of Canterbury, with arms above. Behind stands Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of London. The Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State are borne by peers standing before the monarch on the left and right respectively; the Lord Great Chamberlain stands alongside, bearing his white wand of office, near the Garter King of Arms in his tabard displaying the royal arms (Sir Thomas Wriothesley himslf, the illustrator). Members of the Royal retinue are arrayed behind the King (top right). In the main body of the Chamber, the Bishops are seated on benches to the King's right wearing their parliamentary robes, with the Mitred Abbots behind them. The Lords Temporal are seated to the King's left and on the cross-bench, the status of peers is indicated by the number of miniver bars (white fur edged with gold oak-leaf lace) on their peerage robes: 4 for a duke, 3½ for a marquess, 3 for an earl, 2½ for a viscount, and 2 for a baron. Thus there are 2 dukes, both wearing ducal coronets, the first holding a Marshal's Baton, thus he is the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal of England. Sir William Weston, Prior of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem, premier baron in the roll of peers, dressed in black, sits at the end of the cross-bench. The judges (red-robed and coifed) are on the woolsacks in the centre (two Chief Justices, eight judges, and four Serjeants-at-Law), and behind them kneel the clerks (with quills and inkpots). At the bottom of the picture members of the House of Commons can be seen behind the Bar of the House, with Sir Thomas More, Speaker of the House of Commons, in the centre, wearing his black and gold robe of state.\n\nSince that time the ceremonial has evolved, but not dramatically. Mitred Abbots were removed from Parliament at the time of the Reformation. In 1679 neither the procession nor the Abbey service took place, due to fears of a Popish Plot; although the procession was subsequently restored, the service in the Abbey was not. The monarch's role in the proceedings changed over time: early on, the monarch would say some introductory words, before calling upon the Lord Chancellor (or Lord Keeper) to address the assembly. James I, however, was accustomed to speak at greater length himself, and sometimes dispensed with the Chancellor's services as spokesman. This varying pattern continued in subsequent reigns (and during the Commonwealth, when Cromwell gave the speech), but from 1679 onwards it became the norm for the monarch alone to speak. Since then, the monarch (if present) has almost invariably given the speech, with the exception of George I (whose command of English was poor) and Victoria (after the death of Prince Albert). A dramatic change was occasioned by the destruction of the old Palace of Westminster by fire in 1834; however, the new palace was designed with the ceremony of the State Opening very much in mind, and the modern ceremony dates from its opening in 1852. The entire State Opening of Parliament was filmed and televised for the first time in 1958. \n\nIn 1998, adjustments were made to the ceremonial inside Parliament to shorten the proceedings. The heralds, instead of processing with the monarch, arrived at Parliament earlier and had a separate procession. The number of court officials in the procession was reduced, including one of the ladies in waiting and the Crown Equerry. Also omitted were the three Heads of the Armed Services, represented instead by the Chief of the Defence Staff. Silver Stick in Waiting (the Commander of the Household Cavalry) no longer processed, although Gold Stick-in-Waiting (the honorary Colonel of the Household Cavalry) retained a place.\n\n \nSimilar ceremonies are held in other Commonwealth realms. The governor-general or, in the case of Australia's states and Canada's provinces, the relevant governor or lieutenant governor, respectively, usually delivers the speech from the throne. On occasion, the monarch may open these parliaments and deliver the speech herself. In both Australia and Canada, the last time this occurred was in 1977. In New Zealand, the monarch last opened parliament personally in February 1990.\nIn India, the President of India opens Parliament with an address similar to the Speech from the Throne. This is also the case in Commonwealth Republics with a non-executive Presidency such as Malta, Mauritius and Singapore.\n\nIn the Netherlands a similar ceremony is held on the third Tuesday in September, which is called Prinsjesdag in the Netherlands. Article 65 of the constitution states that \"A statement of the policy to be pursued by the Government is given by or on behalf of the King before a joint session of the two Houses of the States General that is held every year on the third Tuesday in September or on such earlier date as may be prescribed by Act of Parliament.\" In Norway, the King is required by Article 74 of the constitution to preside over the opening of the Storting after it had been declared to be legally constituted by the president of the Storting. After he delivers the Speech from the Throne, outlining the government's policies for the coming year, a member of the government reads the Report on the State of the Realm, an account of the government's achievements of the past year. \n\nIn Sweden a similar ceremony as the British was held until 1974, when the constitution was changed. The old opening of state was in Sweden called \"Riksdagens högtidliga öppnande\" (\"The solemn opening of the Riksdag\") and was, as the British, full of symbolism. After the abolition of the old state opening, the opening is now held in the Riksdag but in the presence of the monarch and his family. It is still the King who officially opens the parliament. After the opening of parliament the King gives a speech followed by the Prime Minister's declaration of government. \n\nIn Israel, a semi-annual ceremony, attended by the President, opens the winter and summer sessions of the Knesset. Though in the past he was a guest sitting in the Knesset's upper deck, the President now attends the ceremony from the speaker's podium and gives his own written address regarding the upcoming session. In the first session of each legislative period of the Knesset, the President has the duty of opening the first session himself and inaugurating the temporary Knesset speaker, and then conducting the inauguration process of all of the Knesset members. \n\nIn some countries with presidential or similar systems in which the roles of head of state and head of government are merged, the chief executive's annual speech to the legislative branch is imbued with some of the ceremonial weight of a parliamentary state opening. The most well-known example is the State of the Union Address in the United States. Other examples include the State of the Nation Address in the Philippines, a former American dependency. These speeches differ from a State Opening in at least two respects, however: they do not in fact open the legislative session, and they are delivered by the chief executive on his or her own behalf. In Poland, the President of Poland delivers his speech to the \"Sejm\" and the Senate at the First Sitting of these Houses, which is similar to Speech from the Throne.

Directed by Cedric Gibbons, it was the second in the Tarzan film series to star Johnny Weissmuller. In 2003, the United States Library of Congress deemed the film \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" and selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry.\n\nTarzan and his wife Jane live in the jungle, along with their chimpanzee Cheeta. Harry Holt and his business partner Martin Arlington, leading a large party of locals, meet them on their way to take ivory from an elephant burial ground. Holt had visited the burial ground with Tarzan on an earlier trip, during which he had also met Jane. Holt had sought Tarzan out, as he was the only one who knew the way to the burial ground. On this trip, Holt tries to convince Jane to return with him to civilization by bringing her gifts such as clothing and modern gadgets. Jane tells him she would rather stay with Tarzan. She does agree to convince Tarzan to act as their guide.\n\nWhen Tarzan calls an elephant, Arlington gets the idea that they can use elephants as pack animals, enabling them to haul much more ivory. When Jane tries to convince Tarzan to call more elephants, she explains to him about hauling the ivory away. Tarzan, thinking that taking the ivory is profaning the burial ground, refuses. In addition, he refuses to even lead them to the burial ground, now that he knows of their intent. Arlington and Holt have everything they own tied up in this venture and are frantic to continue on. Arlington asks Holt how they found the burial ground the first time, and Holt explains that they had followed a dying elephant. Seizing on that idea, Arlington shoots an elephant, mortally wounding it so that it will lead them to the burial ground. Only Jane's intervention keeps Tarzan from murdering Arlington. \n\nAfter being abandoned by Tarzan and Jane, Arlington and Holt lead their baggage carriers, led by Saidi, a friend of Jane and Tarzan's, to the burial ground, following the wounded elephant. Elephants, aware of the impending disgrace of their sacred ground, turn up in the hundreds, and threaten to exterminate Holt and Arlington's party. Tarzan and Jane arrive in time to save them, after which Arlington feigns repentance, promising to leave the next day without the ivory. Satisfied, Tarzan agrees to guide their departure, and sends the elephants away.\n\nEarly the next morning, Arlington ambushes Tarzan, shooting him out of a tree. Tarzan falls into the water, and Arlington thinks he has killed him. After Arlington leaves, a hippopotamus rescues a semi-conscious Tarzan and carries him to a group of chimpanzees, which tend to him. Tarzan has received a head wound, but the bullet only grazed him, though it has left him very weak. The head chimpanzee applies plant sap to staunch the bleeding. \n\nArlington returns to the group, claiming that he saw Tarzan being killed by an alligator. A distraught Jane agrees to return to civilization. Arlington and Holt have their baggage carriers each take a tusk from the burial ground, and they begin to head back. Cheeta leaves Jane and looks for Tarzan. Chased by a lion, Cheeta escapes and comes upon the chimpanzee group tending to Tarzan.\n\nAs Tarzan recuperates, the safari makes its way through the jungle. Cheeta returns and lets Jane know that Tarzan is alive. However, shortly after the safari is confronted by a hostile tribe of \"lion men\", who kill two of the bearers and intend to kill the entire safari. Under cover of gunfire, most of the safari makes it to some nearby caves, set into the face of a rocky cliff. The bearer who was carrying the ammunition crate is killed on the way. When Saidi makes an attempt to retrieve the crate, he is captured by the lion men. Cheeta escapes and runs off to tell Tarzan\n\nThe safari watch in horror the next morning as Saidi is staked out to a tree, as the lion men intend to use him as bait to call lions to attack the safari. When Holt rushes out to save him, he is wounded by a thrown spear. Wounded, he begins to free Saidi when the lions show up and tear him and Saidi to pieces. Meanwhile, Cheeta has returned to Tarzan, who while still weak, sets off after Cheeta.\n\nThe lions attempt to get at the safari, but are held off by Jane and Arlington and one of the bearers. When the bearer goes down on a ledge, Arlington goes out to save him, and he is attacked by a lion. Arlington is killed, but Jane kills the charging lion. As the lions become more aggressive, Tarzan and the chimpanzees arrive. The chimpanzees begin to throw the lion men out of the trees, where they are set upon by the lions. Jane kills two lions before she runs out of ammunition. As she is about to be attacked by the last lion, Tarzan arrives and kills it with his knife. Shortly after, a large herd of elephants arrives, trampling the lions, killing several and running the remainder off. \n\nWith the lion men and the lions routed, the elephants, along with Tarzan, Jane, and Cheeta, return the ivory to the burial ground.\n\nFrom IMDb\n\nIn 1932 M.G.M’s \"Tarzan The Ape Man\" cost $652,675 to make, and took $2.54 million at the box office. Edgar Rice Burroughs, keen to capitalize on the success of the first film (as were M.G.M), began negotiations in March 1932 for future Tarzan films. Discussions between Burroughs’ representative, Ralph Rothmund and M.G.M executives, Irving Thalberg and Sam Marx, had begun in March 1932, and a new contract was signed in May of that year for a second Tarzan feature, with an option for a further two. Burroughs’ received $45,000. Also in May, Burroughs contacted producer Bernard H. Hyman with the suggestion that Tarzan films be released as seasonal events. In mid-June 1932, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that former independent producer Bud Barsky was to write the \"original yarn\" for the yet to be titled Tarzan sequel, and was to be assisted by M.G.M staffers R. L. Johnson and Arthur S. Hyman.\n\nStory conferences were held in March, with the author of the play \"White Cargo\" Leon Gordon, producer Bernie Hyman, supervising art director Cedric Gibbons, and production manager Joe Cohn. These early drafts toyed with the idea of a fight with a huge mechanical crocodile, and a spectacular jungle fire. By May 1933, a dialogue continuity by Howard Emmett Rogers was completed. This and earlier script and conference ideas became the basis for the various drafts of the eventual screenplay credited to James Kevin McGuinness.\n\nSpecial effects were to be overseen by Cedric Gibbons and executed by M.G.M’s A. Arnold Gillespie and Warren Newcombe, James Basevi and Irving Reis. For their day, the special effects of the film were complex, involving such devices as matte paintings, miniatures, split screens, and rear projection.\n\nA June 29, 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that W. S. Van Dyke (director of the first \"Tarzan The Ape Man\"), was to be Gibbons' co-director. By July 1, 1933, Van Dyke was dropped from the project, and Gibbons was announced as the film's sole director. In September 1933, however, the Hollywood Reporter announced that Jack Conway, was to take over the direction of one of Gibbons' units.\n\nFilming on \"Tarzan and His Mate\" began August 2, 1933. Joining Johnny Weissmuller for the sequel were Rod La Rocque (who had just appeared in \"S.O.S. Iceberg\" (1933), co-starring Leni Riefenstahl, one of the last German-U.S co-productions, due to the rise of the Nazi Party), Murray Kinnell (The House of Rothschild), and Frank Reicher (one of 17 films he appeared in 1934). Problems soon developed. After 3 ½ weeks of shooting, the first unit was shut down; Gibbons had shot a lot of excess footage, and costs were spiraling. When it resumed, Gibbons was no longer the director, in his place was Jack Conway as dialogue director with James C. McKay directing a number of animal sequences. A late August 1933 Hollywood Reporter news item announced that Rod La Rocque had been pulled from the cast, and replaced by Paul Cavanagh in the role of Martin Arlington, ‘because of miscasting’. The roles of Tom Pierce and Van Ness were also changed, and Frank Reicher and Murray Kinnell were replaced by Desmond Roberts and William Stack, respectively.\nSome sources report Jack Conway directed most of the picture; however Maureen O’Sullivan has said James C. McKay actually directed the film. His official credit on the picture was Animal Director. McKay (1894-1971) had a resume full of various credits, and he jumped back and forth between the jobs of director and editor. McKay had received a Production Assistant credit on \"Trader Horn\" (1931) directed by W. S. Van Dyke. McKay was initially given the director's chair for the sequel, \"Tarzan Escapes\" (1936), indicating M.G.M must have been happy with the work he did on \"Tarzan and His Mate\"; however there would be many changes to the cast and crew on that film too (including Elmer Sheeley replacing Cedric Gibbons as art director!). \n\nPlans to film in Africa were scrapped and several locations around Los Angeles were used, including Sherwood Forest, Lake Sherwood, Whittier, California, Big Tujunga, and China Flat. Bert Nelson and George Emerson, the M.G.M animal trainers, doubled for Weissmuller. Trapeze artists Alfred Codona and the Flying Codonas, who had performed in the first Tarzan film, also doubled for Weissmuller and O'Sullivan, and acted as the elder Cheeta. Dressed in ape suits, The Picchianis performed in the film, and one of the troupe doubled for Weissmuller in a tree jumping sequence. Nelson also doubled for Paul Cavanagh. As with \"Tarzan the Ape Man\", Indian elephants taken from M.G.M's zoo had attachments fixed to their ears and tusks to suggest African elephants. During the crocodile wrestling scene, a mechanical crocodile, equipped with nigrosine dye sacks to simulate blood, was used. Perhaps the highlight of the action sequences occurs with the elephants vs. lions battle. Travelling matte shots were used to depict lions leaping up and holding on to elephants, who then seized them with their trunks and hurled them down, or crushed them beneath their feet. Tarzan rides a rhinoceros in one scene - a first for film. The rhino, Mary, was imported from the Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg, Germany. Weissmuller did the scene himself, sustaining only minor scrapes to sensitive places from Mary's rough hide.\n\nFilming was not completed until the end of March 1934, because of re-takes and additional aerial scenes involving Jane and Tarzan. Betty Roth, wife of lion owner Louis Roth, doubled for O'Sullivan in some close contact scenes with lions near the film’s conclusion. O’Sullivan was absent for over a month recovering from an appendectomy. M.G.M had spent $1,279,142 on the production. In early April 1934, after previews M.G.M cut the film, editing out fourteen-and-a-half minutes.\n\nAlthough a hit, it did not earn as much as the first Tarzan film in the United States. Internationally it was a huge success, despite the fact that it was banned in Germany by the National Socialist Party on the grounds that it showed a Nordic man in brutal surroundings.\n\nThe film's cult status is largely due to O’Sullivan wearing one of the most revealing costumes in screen history at that time; a halter-top and a loincloth that leave her thighs and hips exposed. Because Jane is a ‘lady’ from England (not Baltimore, as in Burroughs' novel), with manners and poise, her wearing such a provocative outfit is particularly naughty and symbolic of her sexual freedom. In this pre-Code film Jane sleeps in the nude, swims nude with Tarzan, is constantly touched by Tarzan, has a scene in which she is stranded in the jungle without clothes on, and is seen nude in silhouette when dressing in a well lit tent. That Jane and Tarzan sleep together is all the more startling by Hollywood standards because they aren’t married; the end credits list O'Sullvan as Jane ‘Parker,’ emphasizing that she was single and living in sin.\n\nThe scene that caused the most commotion, the ‘underwater ballet’ sequence, was available in three different versions that were edited by M.G.M to meet the standards of particular markets. Gibbons' wife Dolores del Rio had performed a risque nude swim in \"Bird of Paradise\" (1932), a sequence that is said to have inspired the one in Tarzan. Tarzan and Jane (O'Sullivan's swimming double, Josephine McKim, who competed in the 1928 games with Johnny Weissmuller), dance a graceful underwater ballet with Jane completely nude. When she rises out of the water, Jane (now Maureen O’Sullivan) flashes a bare breast. Such big-screen impropriety was rare at the time, and if seen at all was usually done by dancing girl extras, or non-white actresses due to the time's double-standards (witness the topless ‘native’ girls at the start of the film, or the topless ‘natives’ in the 1935 \"Sanders of the River\"). The new Production Code Office thought O'Sullivan's scant costume, coupled with her sexual charisma, was too much. In April, Joseph Breen, director of public relations of the MPPDA, reported to his president, Will Hays, that \"Tarzan and His Mate\" had been rejected because of shots in which \"the girl was shown completely in the nude.\"\n\nWhen M.G.M production head Irving Thalberg protested the jury's decision by claiming that the 1928 film \"White Shadows in the South Seas\" had \"fifty naked women\" in it, the jurors screened that film and determined that none of the women were naked. According to film historian Rudy Behlmer: \"From all evidence, \"three\" versions of the sequence eventually went out to separate territories during the film's initial release. One with Jane clothed in her jungle loin cloth outfit, one with her topless, and one with her in the nude. However, by April 24, 1934, all prints of \"Tarzan and His Mate\" in all territories were ordered changed. Additionally, the New York Censors previewed the film, and insisted that the scene involving Cavanagh lowering his nude body into a portable bathtub be eliminated as well. It was not until Ted Turner took over the M.G.M film library that a positive print of the original film was discovered in the vaults and released in 1986.\n\nThe film was a box office disappointment for MGM.\n\nFilm review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100%, based on , with a rating average of 7.4/10. The liberation of Jane from old world constraints by interacting with Tarzan gets high marks, as does the liberated spirit (not married and proud of it, even in the credits) and use of nudity; the animal treatment needed ASPCA oversight.\n\nThe film is nominated for American Film Institute's 2002 AFI's 100 Years...100 Passions list.\n\n"}

It is apparently an account of the English battle with the Spanish Armada of 1588, but was in fact written by the second Earl of Hardwicke, Philip Yorke, in the 18th century as a literary game with some friends. Although the hoax was debunked in 1839, copies of the Mercurie are still mistakenly referred to as factual accounts in the modern era.\n\nWith its gothic nameplate, faded typeface and Early Modern English spelling, The English Mercurie has many of the hallmarks of an early English newsbook. It contains the dateline of \"Whitehall, July 23d, 1588\", and the claim that it is \"published by AUTHORITIE\", \"For the Prevention of false Reportes\". \nThe four pages start with the spotting of the Spanish Armada by a Captain Fleming near Plymouth, and go on to describe the actions of Sir Francis Drake and Rear Admirals \"Hawkins\" (a reference to Sir John Hawkins) and \"Forbisher\" (a misspelling of Sir Martin Frobisher). \nThe newsbook gives a vivid account of the Spanish fleet's actions, saying\n\nBut about one in the Afternoone, they came in Sighte of the Spanish Armado two Leagues to the Westward of the Eddistone, sailing in the Form of a half-Moon, the Points whereof were seven Leagues asunder.\n\nThe Mercurie estimates the size of the Spanish fleet at 150 ships, and provides information about ships captured by the English fleet.\nThe second section carries the dateline of Ostend, 27 July, which contains a report of the organisation of the Spanish invasion force that was to follow the Armada, with \"thirty thousand Foote and eighteen hundred Horse\". \nThe newsbook then closes with a third report, dated London, 23 July, and describes how Queen Elizabeth I held an audience with dignitaries from the city of London, including the \"Lord Mayor, Aldermen, Common-Council and Lieutenancie\".\n\nThe orchestrator of the hoax was Philip Yorke, 2nd Earl of Hardwicke, along with his friend Dr Thomas Birch, and possibly Yorke's brother Charles. They produced five issues of which three were printed and two were manuscript newsletters.\nDr Birch bequeathed the manuscript and printed copies of the English Mercurie to the British Museum in 1766, without any explanation of their origin.\n\nThe English Mercurie was referred to by George Chalmers, a Scottish antiquarian and political writer, in his 1794 book \"The Life of Thomas Ruddiman\"\nIt predated the \"Mercurius Gallobelgicus\" which is widely accepted in studies of the history of journalism to be the true first newspaper which was written in Latin and appeared in 1594 in Cologne, Germany, and distributed across Europe.\nChalmers adduced the Mercurie as evidence of English invention, saying\nIt may gratify our national pride to be told, that mankind are indebted to the wisdom of Elizabeth, and the prudence of Burleigh, for the first newspaper.\n\nChalmers's assertion was unchallenged for 45 years until Thomas Watts uncovered the existence of the original manuscript in the archives of the British Museum in 1839. He identified the handwriting on the manuscript as being identical to that used in a letter from Yorke as part of Dr Birch's collection.\nThere were other inconsistencies, including the typeface and some spellings and Watts also found corrections on the manuscript in Dr Birch's handwriting The motivation of the authors in creating the English Mercurie is unknown, although it has been speculated that it was not an intentional attempt to mislead, but rather a literary game.\n\nBritish television network Channel 4 contained a reference to The English Mercurie as \"a newspaper report of Drake's role in the Spanish Armada\" in a website for its series \"Elizabeth's Pirates\".\nThe National Library of Australia includes The English Mercurie in its catalogue, among other apparently genuine historical documents from the Tudor and Stuart periods. The Wikipedia page for the Spanish Armada cites The English Mercurie as evidence that 30,000 troops were waiting in the Spanish Netherlands for the fleet so they could mount their invasion\n\n"}

The film is based on the Tichborne case, a historical case of identity theft. In 1854, Roger Tichborne, then-heir to the Tichborne Baronetcy disappeared while traveling in South America. He was thought likely to have set sail with the ship \"Bella\", which was shipwrecked off the coast of the Empire of Brazil, with no known survivors. In 1865, Thomas Castro (an Australian butcher), started claiming to be the missing heir. The dispute over his identity lasted to his death in 1898, and he is mostly known as \"the Claimant\". While Castro is currently considered an impostor, doubts considering his real identity have persisted to the present. \n\nBased on the Tichborne case, the film is set in the late 19th century.

The raised arms of the standing Buddy Bears are aligned on the dissemination of friendliness and optimism, and thus mediate a positive mood. \"The Buddy Bear has become an unofficial ambassador for Germany and is a symbol of Berlin since 2001. The story of the Buddy Bears started with an artistic event in Berlin in 2001. Inspired by the idea of bringing art in the streets of a metropolis like the cow parade in Zurich and New York.\" In addition to the Classic Buddy Bears presented far beyond Berlin’s city limits, the circle of United Buddy Bears came into being in 2002. The Exhibition travel around the world promoting \"peace, international understanding and tolerance among the nations, cultures and religions of this world\".\n\nThe first activities were presented as the \"Buddy Bear Berlin Show\". In 2001, artists painted approximately 350 bears to appear in the public domain, as decorative elements in the streets of Berlin. Four different bear designs (one standing on all four paws, one standing on two legs, one standing on its head and one in a sitting position) took part in this activity in the city centre of Berlin. Afterwards, many of the bears were sold at auctions in aid of child relief organisations. Nowadays, these Berlin Buddy Bears are exclusively presented on private premises, in front of hotels and embassies as well as in the foyers of various office buildings.\n\nThere have already been exhibitions of the original \"Buddy Bears\" — designed by local artists — in the cities of Shanghai (2004), Buenos Aires (2005) and St. Gallen / Switzerland (2006).\n\n\"United Buddy Bears\" is an international art exhibition with more than 140 two metre tall fiberglass bears. Under the motto: \"We have to get to know each other better, it makes us understand one another better, trust each other more, and live together more peacefully\", more than 140 countries acknowledged by the United Nations are represented, promoting \"tolerance, international understanding and the great concept of different nations and cultures living in peace and harmony\". The bears stand \"hand in hand\" in a \"peaceful circle\" (The Art of Tolerance).\n\nThe bears were on display between June and November 2002, in a circle around the Brandenburg Gate. Around 1.5 million people visited this first exhibition.\n\nOn 6 November 2002, the bears were moved to new locations, including their respective countries embassies in Berlin, or back to country that they were based on. Some of the bears were auctioned off to raise money for UNICEF.\n\nAfter the circle of \"United Buddy Bears\" had been such an overwhelming success in 2002, a new circle was created in 2003. The idea was to send the circle on a global tour.\n\nOn their global tour, the \"United Buddy Bears\" promote peace, love, tolerance and international understanding. The circle changes every time it reaches a new city. This is not only due to the local conditions, but also to their constantly changing order, as the bears are always set up in alphabetic order, following the local language of the host country. This always leads to new and sometimes politically very interesting proximities.\n\nEntry to the exhibitions is always free. This makes it possible for many school classes to visit the exhibitions in the morning — as part of their lessons — to explore and learn a lot about the culture, history, landscape, economy and music of all five continents in a playful manner. During past exhibitions more than 40 million visitors have already admired the colorful United Buddy Bears.\n\nIn every metropolis, the United Buddy Bears exhibitions are supported by the government, the foreign ministries, the mayors and the UNICEF organisations. Heads of state – for example the Japanese Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, the German Federal President, Horst Köhler and First Lady of Egypt, Suzanne Mubarak as well as UNICEF Goodwill Ambassadors such as Sir Peter Ustinov, Jackie Chan, Christiane Hörbiger, Mia Farrow, Iris Berben and Ken Done have opened these exhibitions all over the world. \"United Buddy Bears Special Ambassador\" is the actress Dennenesch Zoudé.\n\nThe bears have been displayed at the following Stations since the beginning of the tour:\n\n\nIn the autumn of 2003, the circle of \"United Buddy Bears-The Minis\" — was presented in Berlin for the first time. Since then, this circle has been shown in Frankfurt/Main, in Potsdam and at the Sony Center in Berlin — to name just a few locations. Since 2012, they have also been travelling to destinations outside of Germany, e.g. Bratislava in , Borås in , Calais in and in in Yekaterinburg and Kazan.\n\nBuddy Bear activities and help for children in need have formed an inseparable unit. New \"United Buddy Bears\" are often designed to replace the previous unique sculpture of a particular country. Many countries are already represented with the third or fourth bear. The previous bears designed on behalf of the respective countries are generally sold at auctions.\n\nIn the early years, the Bears were designed by regional artists and Berlin celebrities for the exhibition \"Art in the City\". From 2002 onwards, thanks to support from Lufthansa, Air Berlin and the , artists from all five continents took part in the\ninternational project \"United Buddy Bears\". More than 240 artists from over 150 countries have taken part in this project to date, such as, for example Arik Brauer, René Cadena Ayala, , Ibrahim Hazimeh, Carlos Páez Vilaró, Seo Soo-Kyoung, , Leda Luss Luyken, Ludmila Seefried-Matějková – this is also echoed by the artist and UNICEF Australian National Ambassador, Ken Done.\n\n\n"}

Kinnan held American Meteorological Society Television Seal #3. Kinnan, who also served in World War II as a B-17 bomber pilot and then an Advanced Weather Officer attaining the rank of Captain in the United States Air Force before resigning in March 1953 to enter broadcasting in Oklahoma.\n\nKinnan was born to David V. Kinnan and Hazel Hamer. He met his wife, the former Marjorie G. Ahrendt at North High School in Columbus, OH where they both attended. He has two sons, David E. Kinnan, Esq. and Timothy A. Kinnan. Both of his sons followed in his footsteps and joined the US Air Force. David was an Air Force JAG Officer and Tim went on to a full military career as a fighter pilot and general officer. Wally was a trumpet player with the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra and Charlie Barnet during his undergraduate years at Ohio State out of love for music and as a way to help pay for school.\n\nKinnan attended North High School in Columbus, Ohio. After graduation he attended Ohio State University where he was a mechanical engineering undergraduate. He was a member of the Theta Tau Fraternity and the Ohio State Football band. He left Ohio State to enlist in the United States Army Air Forces. He studied Meteorology from 1947 to 1948 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and took an advanced course in Tropical Meteorology in 1951 at the University of Chicago.\n\nKinnan enlisted in the Air Corps on March 31, 1942 at Fort Hayes, Columbus, Ohio. He began flight training as an aviation cadet in September 1942 and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon graduation from pilot training on April 12, 1943. While in casual status at Luke Army Airfield he broke the fighter gunnery record. He initially trained to be a fighter pilot, however, the Air Corps needed bomber pilots and Kinnan, like many others, were reassigned to bombers. From there he went on to bomber transition and deployed overseas as a B-17 Flying Fortress pilot with the 429th Bombardment Squadron, 2nd Bomb Group, based at Massicault Airfield, Tunisia, as part of the Twelfth Air Force.\n\nKinnan's aircraft was shot down over Eygalières, Vichy France on August 17, 1943. He sustained shrapnel injuries which were compounded when he bailed out too close to the ground and made hard impact. His injuries prevented him from attempting evasion and he was captured.\n\nKinnan’s recount of his bail-out of his bomber aircraft was harrowing even in the telling. After taking fire that damaged the aircraft, alighting the #4 engine and wounding the other pilot; the crew immediately began bail-out procedures. Kinnan, the only pilot at the control yoke, maintained as much control of the aircraft as possible to ensure that his crew members were all safely out. Once they were out he put the aircraft into as stable a configuration that he could to maintain altitude and attitude. But the badly damaged aircraft, on fire, lost the right wing and continued to descend. In order to bail-out, Kinnan had to make his way to the nose hatch. However, the erratic flight of the damaged B-17 required him to crawl and pull himself along.\n\nAs Kinnan was crawling, his parachute caught on some part of the aircraft which left Wally in frantic state trying to unbind himself and his parachute from the rapidly descending aircraft. During this process he had unbuckled his parachute and was never able to put it back on properly. Finally able to free himself he launched himself from the airplane, up and out the normally facing downward hatch and pulled his parachute's ripcord.\n\nKinnan and M/Sgt Henry Petroski were the last two to exit, falling amidst the burning debris of their aircraft. Because he had not been able to properly restrap the parachute on, when it opened it twisted him up causing a severe back injury. This, plus the wounds he had sustained from the flak bursts while still in the aircraft made it impossible for him to evade capture once he was on the ground.\n\nHe was first taken to a Hospital in Arles. Kinnan strongly credits his German captors in France with great humanity and care of his injuries. However, after just only over a week in France they transferred him to another hospital that was part of Dulag Luft near Frankfurt, where his treatment was much more stern. Once processed he was transferred to Stalag Luft III near Sagan, now Żagań in Poland, in mid-September 1943. The reality of the situation in the Stalag system was even more dire and cruel, where life often hinged on having enough to eat.\n\nNear the end of 1943, there were many new prisoners coming into the camp. Kinnan persuaded the German captors to find some decent musical instruments so they could put on some organized musical programs. Kinnan and a group of Who’s Who’s of music that were all interred in German Camps founded a band called the \"Sagan Serenaders\". Kinnan and Pilot Officer Leonard Whiteley of the British Royal Air Force organized and led the group. The Serenaders received donated musical instruments from aid organizations and whatsoever the German captors could scrounge up. One instrument was an unusual trombone that Wally described as a plumber's nightmare. They 'sacrificed' this instrument so that other POW's could turn it into a still.\n\nIncluded in this group were pianist John Bunch, who would later play with bandleaders Woody Herman and Benny Goodman; Tiger Ward; John Brady; Hi Bevins; Nick Nagorka and trumpeter Vince Shank who later would play with Russ Morgan. The Serenaders had four trumpets, two trombones, five saxophones, and four rhythm instruments. Wally Kinnan once said, \"We were beginning to talk seriously about taking the band on tour in the U.S. when and if we could manage to survive the war.\" The 1963 motion picture \"The Great Escape\", which greatly depicts some of the Serenders and Kinnan's experiences, showed a choir singing while the escape started but in actuality, it was the Serenaders. The Serenaders contributed to the effort regularly by practicing their instruments to mask the sound of digging.\n\nKinnan's youngest son, USAF Lt. Gen. Timothy Kinnan, relates that his father, through encoded letters to his wife Marjorie, informed the United States War Department that fifty of the escapees were recaptured by the Germans and executed by firing squad. The letters were decoded by the U.S. government and then sent on to Kinnan's wife.\n\nTowards the end of the war as the Red Army were nearing Stalag Luft III, the Germans forced marched 12,000 prisoners to Stalag VII-A in Bavaria. When the German guards marched the prisoners, including the band members, out of the camp, some assumed they were being marched into a field for execution. However, the forced march proceeded through a blizzard to Spremberg almost 200 miles away. Many of the POWs died during the trek. Food was scarce and Bunch credited Kinnan with saving his life by sharing a potato. After the arrival of General George S. Patton’s Third Army, on April 29, 1945, Kinnan and his fellow POWs in Stalag VII-A were liberated. Kinnan would then spend his processing time at Camp Lucky Strike before being sent stateside. Official records have initial capture date as August 17, 1943 with official repatriation to the United States as of June 30, 1945.\n\nAfter being repatriated, Kinnan attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and received his degree in Meteorology. After the creation of the United States Air Force in 1947, Kinnan became a USAF Weather Officer.\n\nDuring the Korean War, Kinnan served in weather service assignments on Kwajalein Atoll, Guam and Hawaii. He was a pioneer of the Severe Storm Center of the Air Weather Service. Deciding a career in broadcast meteorology was an exciting field, he resigned his commission from the Air Force in 1953 to become one of the earliest on-camera meteorologists.\n\nKinnan, who was affably nicknamed \"The Weatherman\", was a well-known personality in Oklahoma City, Philadelphia, Cleveland and Tampa. Kinnan worked alongside sports anchor Jim Graner at WKYC-TV in Cleveland; later, from 1978 to 1980, he worked at station WTSP in Tampa, FL.\n\nKinnan was one of the first three meteorologists, joining Francis K. Davis and Kenneth H. Jehn, to earn the \"Seal of Approval\" from the American Meteorological Society. Wally often told the story of how they drew straws to determine who would be the first, second, and third meteorologist to earn the seal. Kinnan was number 3, while Davis and Jehn were numbers 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nHe later went on to serve on the Board of the American Meteorological Society for Radio and Television Broadcasting and the Committee on Industrial Meteorology.\n\nHe was also the founding Director of the Franklin Institute Weather Center with Col. Robert C. Miller of the Fawbush-Miller Tornado team.\n\nKinnan died at the age of 83 of an aortic aneurysm on Friday, November 22, 2002 in Houston, Texas.\n\nThe Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Kinnan into their Hall of Fame in 2009.\n\n\n\n"}

In many different Christian traditions, such as those of Baptists, Methodists and Pentecostals, watchnight services are held late on New Year's Eve, and ends after midnight. This provides the opportunity for Christians to review the year that has passed and make confession, and then prepare for the year ahead by praying and resolving. The services often include singing, praying, exhorting, and preaching.\n\nFollowing the lead of the Moravian Brethren who began having \"watch\" services in 1733, the founder of the Methodist Church, John Wesley, originated watch night services in 1740, sometimes calling them \"Covenant Renewal Services\". The services provided Methodist Christians with a godly alternative to times of drunken revelry, such as Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. Today, a Methodist watchnight service includes singing, spontaneous prayers and testimonials, as well as scripture readings; the liturgy for this service is found in \"The United Methodist Book of Worship\".\n\nIn the Church of Scotland, the Watchnight service is a popular ceremony marking the beginning of Christmas Day. This is known as Midnight Mass elsewhere.\n\nWatchnight service has added significance and history in the African-American community in the United States, since many slaves were said to have gathered in churches on New Year's Eve, in 1862, to await news and confirmation of the enactment of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln, on January 1, 1863.\n\nIn Anglican or Roman Catholic churches, this ceremony is often replicated in the form of a Midnight Mass or Eucharist.\n\n"}

All of the 120 elected seats in the 150-seat House of Assembly were up for election. (In addition, there were 20 members appointed by the President and ten elected by the traditional chiefs, who mostly support the government. Electoral colleges for the election of 10 chiefs to the parliament were to be held on 8 April.)\n\nThe ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front party (ZANU-PF) of President Robert Mugabe won the elections with an increased majority against the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). ZANU-PF won 78 seats to the MDC's 41, with one independent. (In the 2000 election, the ZANU-PF won 62 seats to the MDC's 57). According to the Zimbabwe Election Commission, ZANU-PF polled nearly 60% of the vote, an increase of 11% over the 2000 results. The MDC's vote fell 9 percent to 39 percent. As a result of the election, ZANU-PF had a two-thirds majority in the legislature, allowing the government to change the Constitution.\n\nAs the results became clear the MDC denounced what it called \"the sham elections,\" which it said had been marked by massive electoral fraud. \"The elections cannot be judged to be free and fair,\" an MDC statement said. \"The distorted nature of the pre-election playing field and the failure to address core democratic deficits precluded a free and fair election.\" The MDC claimed it would have won 90 seats if the vote had been free and fair.\n\nA detailed account of the MDC's allegations of electoral fraud can be seen at the MDC website. Sokwanele, a Zimbabwean underground pro-democracy movement, also released a report entitled “What happened on Thursday night”. Their report focuses specifically on the time after voting until results were announced.\n\nFull constituency results of the elections can be seen at Adam Carr's Electoral Archive and at Results of the Zimbabwe parliamentary elections, 2005.\n\nThe results showed the same pattern as in 2000. The MDC won virtually all the seats in the main cities, Harare and Bulawayo, where civil society organisations are relatively strong and able to prevent electoral manipulation. The MDC also won a majority of seats in the southern region of Matabeleland, where the Ndebele people, once supporters of Joshua Nkomo's ZAPU, continue to oppose the Shona-dominated ZANU-PF. But in rural Mashonaland, in central and northern Zimbabwe, where the majority of the population lives, ZANU-PF won all but one seat.\n\nIn some notable local results, Emmerson Mnangagwa, speaker of the previous parliament, and tipped at one time to succeed Mugabe but recently fallen from grace, lost his seat Kwe-kwe to the MDC's Blessing Chebundo. Jonathan Moyo, an independent, won the Tsholotsho constituency from the MDC. Another significant loss for the MDC was Chimanimani, contested by Roy Bennett's wife Heather.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Election Support Network, which had some 6,000 observers in the 8,000 polling stations, says that some 10% of would-be voters were turned away, either because their names were not on the electoral roll, they did not have the right identity papers, or they were in the wrong constituency.\n\nFor the 22 weeks leading up to the elections, Sokwanele provides a weekly breakdown of the Zanu-PF government's non-compliance with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol on Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, of which Zimbabwe is a signatory (see the Mauritius Watch articles on their archive page).\n\nThe opposition MDC and Jonathan Moyo have alleged that voters have been threatened with starvation or violence if they fail to support Zanu-PF. \nNo-go areas have been declared in Bindura. \n\nZanu-PF candidates have taken over control of grain stocks in Manicaland and Masvingo from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) and are vetting beneficiaries. \n\nMuchauraya said in Chipinge South, Enock Porusingazi was issuing badges inscribed \"Election 2005\" to supporters attending his rallies. The badges are then used as a ticket to buy maize.\n\nOn 8 March at Betura village, ward 16, more than 2 000 people were denied access to buy grain for allegedly failing to produce the badges. Only 200 people who had attended Zanu-PF rallies over the weekend had the badges and were allowed to buy maize.\n\nZimbabwe's main opposition party said an investigation indicates massive electoral fraud in at least 30 seats won by the ruling Zanu-PF party. \n\nThe Movement for Democratic Change said in 11 races the winning Zanu-PF candidate got more votes in the official returns than the government's own electoral commission said were cast in those races.\n\nIn each case, the MDC said its candidate had an unassailable lead, polling more than half the official total of votes cast. However, the official returns showed 183,000 more votes than the electoral commission said were cast.\n\nMDC spokesperson Paul Themba Nyathi said the MDC limited its analysis to the 30 seats because the electoral commission refused to release figures for other races, a decision he said \"indicates widespread irregularities\" in those other areas.\n\n\"It is the view of the mission that the 2005 parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe reflect the free will of the people of Zimbabwe\" said South African Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana, who led the South African government observer mission for the elections.\n\nMdladlana said the elections on Thursday \"by and large\" conformed to election guidelines adopted by southern African leaders last year for holding a democratic vote.\n\n\"Let me congratulate the people of Zimbabwe for holding a peaceful, credible and well-organised election which we feel reflects the will of the people\" said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the South African cabinet minister that led the 55-member, 11-country observer mission from the Southern African Development Community.\n\nMlambo Ngcuka said the observer mission had asked the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) to provide evidence to support their claims of discrepancies in 32 of the 120 constituencies.\n\n\"We have received complaints and asked for information. We still don't have it. There is not much more we can do.\" she said.\n\nThe election date was set by President Robert Mugabe on 1 February. 31 March was a public holiday to enable easier voter participation. The parliament was dissolved on 30 March, one day before the elections. The voters' roll was closed on 4 February. Nomination courts sat on 18 February to receive names of those intending to contest in the polls (results).\n\nThe voters roll is the cornerstone of \"one person – one vote.\" Attempts to verify this have been extremely difficult to carry out because of obstruction and non-co-operation from the Zimbabwe Registrar General. \n\nThe Registrar General refused to release the roll in electronic form, supported by judgments from the Supreme Court, necessitating any analysis to work from a paper copy. Electoral Law is very specific in that the roll must be readily and freely available to any person, however it took two years to obtain such a copy.\n\nIn February, South African president Thabo Mbeki conceded that Zimbabwe's voters roll was defective and needed to be looked at. \n\nOnly a single MDC constituency managed to complete the audit ahead of the deadline for objections to the voters' roll – a month before the poll. \n\nIn that constituency, 64 percent of people in one densely populated block in Harare North, are not known at the addresses given on the voters' roll.\n\nTens of thousands of former workers on white-owned farms were deprived of their votes in the March election. The workers were expelled from their homes on farms along with their employers. Thus they did not have the necessary wad of official documents required to register as voters. In addition, many could not afford to travel to their original farm constituencies to verify their details on voters' rolls. Recently enacted laws demand that potential voters provide proof of residence before they can register. Rural Zimbabweans either produce letters from their headman or chief or from their farm employer as proof of residence.\n\nThe main parties participating are:\n\n\nZanu-PF is using claimed interference of Tony Blair, the British prime minister, and United States president George W. Bush in Zimbabwean politics, as an election issue. ZANU-PF is also stressing the benefits obtained through its policy of land reform.\n\nThe MDC sees the main issues as being jobs, food, peace, affordable AIDS drugs and honest, competent emphatic leadership. Their rallying cry is \"Change!\", and their symbol is an open hand.\n\nVoter education\nIn accordance with an Act of Parliament:\n\n\nPolling stations\n\nHigh Court Judge George Chiweshe, who chairs the recently established Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, stated that 8227 polling stations will be set up in all of the country's 10 provinces – more than double the number used in previous elections. \n\nHarare alone is expected to have 522 polling stations, up from 167 polling stations in the presidential elections.\nFor the first time since independence from white minority rule in 1980, Zimbabwe will be holding elections on one day as opposed to two. Ballot counting will also take place at individual polling stations and new, translucent ballot boxes will replace wooden ones used in previous elections.\n\nVoting must take place at these polling stations: any Zimbabweans living overseas must therefore have registered to be in the electoral roll by 4 February, and must vote in Zimbabwe. Requirements such as these are not uncommon in democratic countries.\n\nZimbabwe ratified new Southern African Development Community rules in August 2004 governing principles and guidelines on elections; however, no reports on Zimbabwe's compliance have been issued by the body. One of the stipulations is that SADC monitors be invited 90 days before the poll.\n\nBy 4 February, an SADC team tasked with the responsibility of ensuring that Zimbabwe complies with the regional protocol had yet to receive permission to visit. \n\nNon-government organisations (NGOs), among them Amnesty International, 32 Nigerian NGOs and 17 from Zimbabwe, have expressed concern about the continued abuses of human rights in the country. African Union Chairman, President Olusegun Obasanjo, has been urged to prevail on Zimbabwe, to fully implement recommendations of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR), on improving human rights conditions. The Commission made a fact-finding mission to Zimbabwe in June 2002, and the Union's findings and recommendations were adopted in January 2005, at its summit in Abuja.\n\n\"The majority of human rights concerns documented by the fact-finding mission in 2002 remain serious problems today,\" the NGOs said.\n\nOn 19 February 2005, 32 nations were invited by President Robert Mugabe to observe the parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe. \n\n\nOther organisations among those invited are the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, Law Society of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Election Support Network, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Affirmative Action Group, Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, Centre for Peace Initiatives in Southern Africa and the Southern African Institute for Democracy and Good Governance.\n\nAziz Pahad, deputy foreign minister for South Africa, said the country has been invited to observe the Zimbabwean poll in at least five different capacities.\n\nIt has been invited as a member of SADC, as chair of the organ on politics, defence and security, and as a neighbouring country. The ruling African National Congress has also been asked to send an observer team, while parliament has set up a multi-party delegation.\n\nFive members of South Africa's governing African National Congress party arrived in Harare on 10 March headed by James Motlatsi, the first foreign observers.\n\nThe 20-member South African parliamentary observer mission led by ANC chief whip Mbulelo Goniwe left for Zimbabwe on 14 March, and will return to South Africa on 3 April. On 18 April, the Independent Democrats Member of Parliament and mission member Vincent Gore withdrew, saying that since their arrival in Harare, the mission had been plagued by inefficiency, bad planning \"and wasted time\". \n\nThere is also a South African government delegation, led by Labour Minister Membathisi Mdladlana, which arrived 15 March. \n\nThe 50-member SADC observer mission including 10 South African delegates headed by Minerals and Energy Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka (later Deputy President), spokesperson South African foreign affairs official Nomfanelo Kota, left on 15 March. \n\nThe Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU)—a member of the South African ruling party alliance— sent a fact-finding mission in October 2004 to talk to the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) and research conditions for a fair poll. They were deported from Zimbabwe within hours after police broke up a meeting between them and ZCTU.\n\nOn 2 February 2005, a second mission led by Zwelinzima Vavi, Secretary-General of COSATU, was turned back at Harare airport, charged under Section 18A of the Immigration Act which relates to prohibited immigrants. In response, George Bizos, a respected human rights lawyer, said that all Southern African Development Community members are allowed to enter Zimbabwe without applying for a visa. \n\nAfter a meeting the next day between the unions in South Africa Cosatu spokesperson Patrick Craven said \"It is quite clear at the moment as things stand that there cannot be free and fair elections\".\n\nZCTU requested that an independent electoral commission be established and international observers be allowed in the country, and the government also needed to scrap strict laws restricting the opposition's access to the media and barring it from holding public rallies and meetings without police permission.\n\nUnder the Public Order and Security Act (POSA), it is a requirement for organisers of public meetings to first notify the police of the intention to gather. It is an offence, under the same law, for more than five people to meet without notifying the police, who have the prerogative to permit or deny permission to hold public meetings. ZTCU suggested that the date of the elections be postponed. ZCTU themselves have been barred from observing the election. \n\nAmnesty International has said that Zanu-PF has used threats and intimidation against opposition supporters ahead of the elections which now cannot be free and fair. \n\nRoy Bennett's wife Heather Bennett intended to stand for Chimanimani rural district after the nomination court refused papers filed on behalf of her jailed husband. \n\nHowever, on 15 March Zimbabwe's new Electoral Court ruled he could contest parliamentary elections. Nomination would be accepted on 4 April, while polling would take place on 30 April. An appeal by the government reversed this. The appeal was not contested by the MDC or the Bennetts. They considered that voters would be safer polling on the same day as the rest of the country, where a delay would allow Zanu-PF to concentrate efforts in that district. The MDC has never won a by-election.\n\nRoy Bennett's application for release before the elections, on the basis of good behaviour and dissolution of the parliament that ordered the incarceration, failed. \n\nSikhumbuzo Ndiweni, a former ZANU PF Bulawayo Provincial Information and Publicity Secretary, is co-ordinating the Independent Candidates Solidarity Network.
