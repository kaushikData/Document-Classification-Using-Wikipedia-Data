The main organizers of the event are Pekka Aakko (\"Pehu\" of Accession) and Jussi Laakkonen (\"Abyss\" of Future Crew). The Summer event takes place every year between late July and early August, and lasts three to four days, and the Winter event is held in January or February. The most recent Assembly was held from 3 to 6 August 2018 at Messukeskus in Helsinki.\n\nAssembly Winter was announced in early 2007. The winter party is a more gaming oriented LAN party type event where as the summer events continues the traditions of the original demoparty under the name Assembly Summer. Both parties are held once a year.\n\nThe first Assembly was held from July 24 to July 26, 1992, in Kauniainen. It was organized by the Amiga demo groups Complex and Rebels, and the PC demo group Future Crew. The staff grew into a large non-profit group of individuals known as Assembly Organizing. Through the 1990s, Assembly grew so large that even exposition halls no longer sufficed, and only the largest of sports arenas met the partygoers' needs. In 1999 they rented the largest sports arena in the country, Hartwall Areena in Helsinki, with over 5000 visitors and 3500 computers on the ice rink.\n\nThe 2004 edition of the party also set up a record: in July 2004, QuakeCon announced it was holding the world's first Doom 3 competitions on the event starting on August 12–14, roughly a week after the game's release on August 3. Assembly, however, managed to snatch the first place after acquiring copies of the game via FedEx with the help of some contacts in the United States and holding the competition during August 5–8.\n\nAs of 2017 the party has been held for 25 consecutive years.\n\nSince the year 1995 an event called Boozembly has been organized in a nearby forest. It is officially unrelated to Assembly but serves as a meeting point for Assembly attendees as well as for other computer hobbyists and their friends. In Boozembly it is possible to use intoxicants which is not allowed in Assembly. Later IT corporations started to sponsor free beer for Boozembly. Like Assembly, Boozembly itself has become an important part of Finnish demoscene culture.\n\nThe party includes multiple competitions, or compos including but not limited to:\n\n\nFor the first eight years of Assembly, the demo and intro competitions were split into separate PC and Amiga categories. Starting in 2000, the platforms have been combined, with PC (Windows or Linux), Amiga, Mac and even high-end consoles competing in the same demo and intro competitions. Similarly, Commodore 64 competitions were replaced with \"oldskool\" competitions that also allow entries for some other old platforms, such as various 8-bit systems and older Amigas.\n\nEntries are submitted by demogroups and individual artists and are rated by judges. All demos which are deemed to be of a high enough standard are then shown on a big screen. Entries which break the competition rules (e.g. use copyrighted material, or aren't suitable for the category to which they are entered) are disqualified. People who are present at the arena vote for the entries, and the results are published on the Assembly website. The entries are usually made available by the artists at scene.org or on the artists own website.\n\nAssembly's demo competitions generally hold a very high level, especially for a party that is not specific to the demoscene. Notable winners include \"Lifeforce\" by ASD, \"Panic Room\" by Fairlight and \"Frameranger\" by Fairlight, CNCD and Orange.\n\nIn recent years, Assembly has broadcast content from its in-house media effort AssemblyTV to local and national TV networks, as well as producing web streams for people to watch live over the internet — spots for hundreds, if not thousands of viewers are catered for and these streams have been watched all over the world, not just in Finland. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies, the competitions and party reports, the educational sessions that are being held during the party are broadcast via AssemblyTV as well.\n\nARTtech seminars are free to attend educational seminar sessions that are being held during the party at the venue location. The sessions cover various subjects that are usually related to the main party theme and idea, including sessions about programming (coding), graphic design, music composition, game development, hardware hacks, scene history and more.\n\n"}

This setback resulted in the permanent loss of the Crusader castle of Baarin. \n\nWhen Zengi became ruler of Mosul in 1127 and Aleppo in 1128, the Crusaders were faced with a dangerous opponent. For several years afterward, Zengi gained power at the expense of neighboring Muslim states. By occasionally allying itself with the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, the Muslim emirate of Damascus successfully resisted Zengi's efforts to conquer that city. \n\nIn early 1137, Zengi invested the castle of Ba'rin, about 10 miles northwest of Homs. When King Fulk marched with his host to raise the siege, his army was attacked and scattered by Zengi's forces. Nothing is known about the battle. The Christian chronicler William of Tyre \"gave no tactical information, and neither did the Arab historians.\" \n\nAfter their defeat, Fulk and some of the survivors took refuge in Ba'rin castle, which Zengi surrounded again. \"When they ran out of food they ate their horses, and then they were forced to ask for terms.\" Meanwhile, large numbers of Christian pilgrims had rallied to the army of Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus, Raymond of Antioch and Joscelin II of Edessa. \n\nWith this host approaching the castle, Zengi suddenly granted Fulk and the other besieged Franks terms. In return for their freedom and evacuation of the castle, a ransom was set at 50000 dinar. The Franks, unaware of the imminent arrival of the large relieving army, accepted Zengi's offer. \n\nIn April 1137, John Comnenus laid siege to Shaizar but his efforts came to nothing when Zengi relieved the city in May. Ba'rin was never recovered by the Franks.\n\n"}
{"id": "889751", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=889751", "title": "Battle of the Beanfield", "text": "Battle of the Beanfield\n\nThe Battle of the Beanfield took place over several hours on 1 June 1985, when Wiltshire Police prevented The Peace Convoy, a convoy of several hundred New Age travellers, from setting up the 1985 Stonehenge Free Festival in Wiltshire, England. The police were enforcing a High Court injunction obtained by the authorities prohibiting the 1985 festival from taking place. Around 1,300 police officers took part in the operation against approximately 600 travellers.\n\nThe convoy of travellers heading for Stonehenge encountered resistance at a police road block seven miles from the landmark. Police claim that some traveller vehicles then rammed police vehicles in an attempt to push through the roadblock. Around the same time police smashed the windows of the convoy's vehicles and some travellers were arrested. The rest broke into an adjacent field and a stand-off consequently developed that persisted for several hours. According to the BBC \"Police said they came under attack, being pelted with lumps of wood, stones and even petrol bombs\". Conversely, \"The Guardian\" states the travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting so \"was false\".\n\nEventually the police launched another attack during which the worst of the violence is purported to have taken place. According to \"The Observer\", during this period pregnant women and those holding babies were clubbed by police with truncheons and the police were hitting \"anybody they could reach\". When some of the travellers tried to escape by driving away through the fields, \"The Observer\" states that the police threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them in an attempt to stop them.\n\nDozens of travellers were injured, 8 police officers and 16 travellers were hospitalised. 537 travellers were eventually arrested. This represents one of the largest mass arrest of civilians since at least the Second World War, possibly one of the biggest in English legal history.\n\nTwo years after the event, a Wiltshire police sergeant was found guilty of Actual Bodily Harm as a consequence of injuries incurred by a member of the convoy during the Battle of the Beanfield.\n\nIn February 1991 a civil court judgement awarded 21 of the travellers £24,000 in damages for false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest. The award was swallowed by their legal bill as the judge did not award them legal costs.\n\nThe British New Age Travellers movement developed in the 1970s with the intended purpose of attempting to create an alternative way of life. Travellers maintained themselves partly by travelling between, organising and trading at free festivals. After a stay with CND demonstrators, one group of travellers came to be known as \"The Peace Convoy\".\n\nIn 1984 the Department of the Environment passed management of Stonehenge and the surrounding land to English Heritage. By that time the festival had grown in size, the attendance figure for the 1984 festival was estimated at 100,000. Due to the high attendance figures there was little authority present at Stonehenge festivals and the police were unable to shut them down or implement the law. Consequently, most illegal drugs were unrestrictedly available and advertised for purchase. Traders at the festival were neglecting to obtain licences or pay taxes.\n\nCritics claimed that the 1984 festival had resulted in the destruction of archaeological information and on the site itself, \"holes had been dug in Bronze Age barrows for latrines and as bread ovens, motorcycles had been ridden over them, churning the surface. Fences had been torn down, and a thousand young trees cut down for firewood\". The clean-up cost upwards of £20,000, besides the archaeological information that was lost. Landowners also claimed that damage to Stonehenge, other property damage, trespassing, recreational drug use and bathing naked in rivers had occurred during the festival.\n\nA civil high court injunction was consequently imposed prohibiting the proposed 1985 festival from taking place.\n\nAfter staying the previous night in Savernake Forest, the Convoy on the morning of 1 June numbered up to 140 vehicles, most of them buses and vans converted into living spaces; it is estimated they contained 600 people. The police had laid down an exclusion zone 4 miles (6.4 km) around the perimeter of Stonehenge, which the convoy hoped to breach. The Convoy met resistance when the police set up a roadblock near Shipton Bellinger about 7 miles (11 km) from Stonehenge. This was achieved by tipping three lorry loads of gravel across the road. According to \"The Observer\", the convoy evaded the main roadblock on the A303 by slipping down a side road but were then met with a second roadblock. At this juncture the police claim that some traveller vehicles rammed police vehicles in an attempt to escape the roadblock. At around the same time the police smashed the windscreens of traveller vehicles and arrested occupants.\n\nMost traveller vehicles broke into an adjacent field, by driving through a hedgerow according to one source. A stand-off consequently ensued. Travellers made attempts to negotiate with police but the officer in charge, Assistant Chief Constable Lionel Grundy, ordered that all travellers be arrested. There were outbreaks of violence during which several members of the Convoy received head injuries. An ambulance was allowed through to take them to hospital. Police Officer Bernie Lund, who was on scene, claimed that during the stand-off, petrol bombs and sticks were thrown at officers. However \"The Guardian\" states that travellers were not armed with petrol bombs and that police intelligence suggesting that they were \"was false\".\n\nAt 7pm officers in riot gear entered the field and launched a final attack. Pregnant women and those holding babies were hit by police with truncheons according to \"The Observer\", who also noted journalist Nick Davies stating that police were hitting \"anybody (that) they could reach\". When some travellers tried to escape by driving away through the field police allegedly threw truncheons, shields, fire-extinguishers and stones at them to stop them. \"The Observer\" and \"The Independent\" report that travellers' vehicles were smashed and set on fire.\n\nEight police officers and sixteen travellers were hospitalised. One traveller was taken away with a suspected fractured skull.\n\nThe large majority of the travellers, over 500, were arrested on suspicion of obstructing police and obstructing the highway. One source states that this represented the largest mass arrest of civilians in English legal history, another that it was the biggest figure since the Second World War. There were insufficient holding cells in local jails to hold all those arrested. Convoy members were transported throughout the Midlands and even to northern England. Not all children and parents ended up in the same region. Most of the arrests did not result in successful prosecutions.\n\nTraveller Alan Lodge, speaking to the BBC, described it as \"an ambush that happened on a small, mild mannered bunch of people\".\n\nThe UK miners' strike had ended earlier in the same year, and police compared this event with tactics used at the Battle of the Beanfield, stating: \"The Police operation had been planned for several months and lessons in rapid deployment learned from the miners' strike were implemented.\"\n\nMost independent eyewitness accounts of the events relate that the police used violent tactics against men, women and children, including pregnant women; and purposely damaged the vehicles used by the convoy.\n\nThe travellers had departed from Savernake Forest, which is owned by the Earl of Cardigan's family. The Earl of Cardigan decided to follow the convoy on his motorbike. The Earl describes that during the initial confrontation there were negotiations with police who insisted that the travellers would not be allowed to pass. The travellers subsequently began entering into a field. Then \"Police rushed out on foot, from behind their barricades. Clutching drawn truncheons and riot shields, they ran round to the driver's door of each vehicle, slamming their truncheons into the bodywork to make a deafening noise, and shouting at every driver, 'get out, get out, hand over your keys, get out'\". He states that police \"smashing up vehicles\" and instructions to \"Get out!\" often happened simultaneously, giving travellers no time to react before police used riot sticks to break the vehicles' windscreens. Cardigan described seeing a very pregnant woman being \"repeatedly clubbed on the head\" by police, many of whom had their ID numbers covered up. He also saw Police with hammers smashing up the dashboards of several of the now-abandoned motor-coach homes.\n\nCardigan also described how he was approached by the police the following day, who wanted permission to remove travellers who were still at Savernake: \"They said they wanted to go into the campsite 'suitably equipped' and 'finish unfinished business'. Make of that phrase what you will. I said to them, that if it was my permission they were after, they did not have it. I did not want a repeat of the grotesque events that I'd seen the day before.\"\n\nITN Reporter Kim Sabido was at the scene and recorded a piece-to-camera in which he claimed that he had witnessed \"some of the most brutal police treatment of people\" that he had seen in his entire career as a journalist. He also remarked on the number of people that had been \"clubbed\" by police including those \"holding babies in their arms\". He felt that an inquiry should be held into what had happened. Sabido later claimed that when he went back to the ITN library to look at the rushes, most of the footage had \"disappeared, particularly some of the nastier shots.\" Some of this missing footage was later rediscovered and incorporated into \"Operation Solstice\" a documentary shown on Channel 4 in 1991.\n\nNick Davies reported for the \"Observer\" that \"There was glass breaking, people screaming, black smoke towering out of burning caravans and everywhere there seemed to be people being bashed and flattened and pulled by the hair. Men, women and children were led away, shivering, swearing, crying, bleeding, leaving their homes in pieces.\"\n\nFreelance photographer Ben Gibson, engaged by \"The Observer\" that day, was arrested and charged with obstructing a police officer. He was later acquitted. Another freelance photographer, Tim Malyon, had to flee at one point.\n\nTwenty-four of the travellers sued Wiltshire Police for wrongful arrest, assault and criminal damage to themselves and their property. Six years after the event a verdict was reached. Twenty-one of the travellers were successful in their case and were awarded £24,000 in damages towards their false imprisonment, damage to property and wrongful arrest. The judge declined to award their legal costs and their compensation consequently went towards paying for this. Their barrister, Lord Gifford QC, stated \"It left a very sour taste in the mouth.\"\n\nIn court, individual police officers were difficult to identify, as they had hidden their identification numbers on the day. Despite this, one police sergeant was convicted of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on a member of the Convoy.\n\nPolice radio and video was used as evidence during the court case, however there was a recording gap in both the radio and video recordings. The recording gap in the video footage was allegedly due to the video tape breaking when the convoy was initially halted at the roadblock. There was also evidence that radio logs of conversations between officers on the day of the battle had been altered.\n\nThe Earl of Cardigan testified in court against Wiltshire Police. His testimony proved vital in supporting the allegation that Police violence had been excessive. He was criticised by several national newspapers for acting as a witness against Wiltshire Police; Bill Deedes' editorial in The Daily Telegraph claimed he was a class traitor. Consequently, the Earl successfully sued for defamation.\n\nLegislation was introduced in the form of the Public Order Act 1986 and later the Criminal Justice Act 1994 that made the travellers' way of life increasingly difficult to sustain.\n\nFollowing the events of 1985, the four-mile blockade of Stonehenge was maintained for future summer solstices. Consequently, conflict between police and those trying to reach Stonehenge continued to take place every year. Neo-druid leader Arthur Uther Pendragon was arrested on each and every summer solstice between 1985 and 1999 whilst trying to access Stonehenge. In the summer of 1988 around 130 people were arrested and in 1989 that figure rose to 260.\n\nFor the 1999 summer solstice English Heritage granted \"limited access\" to Stonehenge to neo-druids. This access permission was later rescinded when 200 New Age travellers broke on to the site. Twenty people were arrested.\n\nDespite repeated calls, an inquiry into the events of 1 June 1985 has never been honoured.\n\nSinger Roy Harper's song \"Back to the Stones\" refers to the Battle of the Beanfield. It was recorded in 1989 and appears on his 1993 live album \"Unhinged.\n\nThe Hawkwind song \"Confrontation\" from the album Out & Intake includes a description of the day's events and includes a dramatisation of some events including the repeated phrase \"I am not interested in anything you have to say\".\n\nThe Levellers' song \"Battle of the Beanfield\", from their 1991 album \"Levelling the Land\", was inspired by the Battle of the Beanfield.\n\nBritish progressive-rock band Solstice wrote a song which comments on the Battle. \"Circles\" is found on their 1997 album of the same name, and includes what sounds like reporting from the battle, with Kim Sabido's voice-over.\n\nThe song \"Itinerant Child\", by Ian Dury and Chaz Jankel, which appears on the 1998 album \"Mr. Love Pants\", by Ian Dury & The Blockheads, was inspired by Dury's experiences during the incident.\n\nThe police riot is a feature of the 2001 fictional novel He Kills Coppers by Jake Arnott, partially following changes in police culture between the 1960s and the 1980s, later made into an ITV TV series. The confrontation is also featured in the 2018 novel \"The Fountain in the Forest\" by Tony White.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1941706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1941706", "title": "Corfu incident", "text": "Corfu incident\n\nThe Corfu incident was a 1923 diplomatic and military crisis between Greece and Italy. It was triggered when an Italian general heading a commission to resolve a border dispute between Albania and Greece was murdered in Greek territory along with members of his staff. In response, Benito Mussolini issued a severe ultimatum to Greece and when it was not accepted in whole, dispatched forces to bombard and occupy Corfu. Mussolini defied the League of Nations and stated Italy would leave if it arbitrated in the crisis, and the Conference of Ambassadors instead eventually tendered an agreement favoring Italy. This was an early demonstration of the League's weakness when dealing with larger powers.\n\nThere was a boundary dispute between Greece and Albania. The two nations took their dispute to the Conference of Ambassadors, which created a commission of British, French, and Italian officials to determine the boundary, which was authorized by the League of Nations to settle the dispute. The Italian General Enrico Tellini became the chairman of the commission.\nFrom the outset of the negotiations, the relations between Greece and the commission were bad. Eventually the Greek delegate openly accused Tellini of working in favour of Albania's claims.\n\nOn August 27, 1923, Tellini, two of his aides, their interpreter and a chauffeur fell into an ambush and were assassinated by unknown assailants at the border crossing of Kakavia, which is near the town of Ioannina, within Greek territory. The five victims were Tellini, Major Luigi Corti, Lieutenant Mario Bonacini, Albanian interpreter Thanas Gheziri and the chauffeur Remigio Farnetti. None of the victims were robbed. \nThe incident occurred close to the disputed border and therefore could have been carried out by either side.\n\nAccording to Italian newspapers and the official statement of the Albanian government, the attack was carried out by Greeks, while other sources, including the Greek government and its officials and the Romanian consul in Ioannina, attributed the murder to Albanian bandits.\nAlso, Reginald Leeper, the British Ambassador to Greece, in a letter to the British Foreign Secretary sent in April 1945, opines that the Greeks can blame Cham Albanians for the murder of General Tellini.\n\nUpon news of the murder, anti-Greek demonstrations broke out in Italy. The Greek newspapers were reported by Australian newspapers to \"condemn unanimously the Tellini crime, and express friendly sentiments towards Italy. They hope that the Cabinet will give legitimate satisfaction to Italy without going beyond the limits of national dignity.\"\n\nItaly sent an ultimatum to Greece on August 29, 1923, demanding: (1) a complete official apology at the Italian legation in Athens, (2) a solemn funeral in the Catholic cathedral in Athens in the presence of all the Greek government, (3) military honours for the bodies of the victims, (4) full honours by the Greek fleet to the Italian fleet which would be sent to Piraeus, (5) capital punishment for the guilty, (6) an indemnity of 50 million lire within five days of receipt of the note and (7) a strict inquiry, to be carried out quickly with the assistance of the Italian military attaché. In addition, Italy demanded that Greece must reply to the ultimatum within 24 hours.\n\nGreece replied to Italy on August 30, 1923, accepting four of the demands which with modifications were as follows: (1) The commandant of Piraeus would express the Greek Government's sorrow to the Italian Minister, (2) a memorial service will be held in the presence of members of the government, (3) on the same day a detachment of the guard would salute the Italian flag at the Italian legation, (4) the military would render honors to the remains of the victims when they were transferred to an Italian warship. The other demands were rejected on the ground that they would infringe the sovereignty and honor of Greece. In addition, the Greek government declared its complete willingness to grant, as a measure of justice, an equitable indemnity to the families of the victims, and that it didn't accept an enquiry in the presence of the Italian military attaché but it would be pleased to accept any assistance which Colonel Perone (the Italian military attaché) might be able to lend by supplying any information likely to facilitate the discovery of the assassins.\n\nMussolini and the Italian cabinet were not satisfied with the reply of the Greek government and declared that it was unacceptable. The Italian press, including the opposition journals, endorsed Mussolini's demands and insisted that Greece must comply without discussion. Mussolini's decision was received with enthusiasm in all Italy.\n\nOn August 31, 1923, a squadron of the Italian Navy bombarded the Greek island of Corfu and landed 5,000 to 10,000 troops. Airplanes aided in the attack. Italian fire was concentrated on the town's Old Fortress, which had long been demilitarized and served as a shelter for refugees from Asia Minor, and on the Cities Police school at the New Fortress, which was also a refugee shelter. The bombardment lasted 15 to 30 minutes. As a result of the bombardment 16 civilians were killed, 30 injured and two had limbs amputated, while according to other sources 20 were killed and 32 wounded. There were no soldiers reported among the victims, all of whom were refugees and orphans. The majority of those killed were children. The Commissioner of the Save the Children Fund described the bombing as \"inhuman and revolting, unjustifiable and unnecessary.\n\nThe prefect of Corfu, Petros Evripaios, and Greek officers and officials were arrested by the Italians and detained aboard an Italian warship. The Greek garrison of 150 men did not surrender but retired to the interior of the island.\n\nAfter the landing, the Italian officers were worried that British citizens may have been wounded or killed, and were relieved when they learned that there were no British among the victims.\n\nThe residence of the British officer in charge of the police training school, who was away on vacation, was looted by Italian soldiers.\n\nThe Greek Government proclaimed martial law throughout Greece. The Greek fleet was ordered to retire to the Gulf of Volos to avoid contact with the Italian fleet.\nIn the Athens Cathedral, a solemn memorial service was held for the persons who were killed in the Corfu bombardment, and the bells of all of the churches were tolled continuously. After the service, demonstrations against Italy broke out. \nAll places of amusement were closed as a sign of mourning for the victims of the bombardment.\n\nAfter the protest of the Italian Minister, the Greek Government suspended for one day the newspaper \"Eleftheros Typos\" for characterizing the Italians as \"the fugitives of Caporetto\" and dismissed the censor for allowing the statement to pass.\nThe Greek Government provided a detachment of 30 men to guard the Italian Legation in Athens. Greek newspapers were unanimous in condemning Italy's action.\n\nItaly closed the Straits of Otranto to Greek ships. In addition, Italy suspended all Greek shipping companies sailing for her, and ordered Italian ships to boycott Greece, although the Greek ports were open to Italian vessels.\nGreek steamers were detained in Italian ports and one was seized by a submarine in the straits of Corfu, but on September 2, the Italian Ministry of Marine ordered all Greek ships to be released from Italian ports.\nAnti-Greek demonstrations broke out in Italy again. The Italian government ordered the Italian reservists in London to hold themselves in readiness for army service. The King of Italy, Victor Emmanuel III, returned to Rome from his summer residence immediately. The Italian military attaché who was sent to inquire into the murder of the Italian delegates was recalled by the Italian legation, and Greek journalists were expelled from Italy.\n\nAlbania reinforced the Greco-Albanian frontier and prohibited passage across.\n\nSerbian newspapers declared that Serbia would support Greece, while elements in Turkey advised Mustafa Kemal to seize the opportunity to invade Western Thrace.\n\nHead of the Near East Relief said that the bombardment were completely unnecessary and unjustified. Italy called the American legation to protest against this statement.\n\nChairman on the League of Nations commissioning assisting deported women and children, who was eyewitness of the bombardment said: \"The crime of Corfu was official murder by a civilized nation...I consider the manner in which Corfu occupied as inhuman.\"\n\nOn September 1, Greece appealed to the League of Nations, but Antonio Salandra, the Italian representative to the League, informed the Council that he had no permission to discuss the crisis.\nMussolini refused to co-operate with the League and demanded that the Conference of Ambassadors should deal with the matter. Italy assured that it would leave the League rather than allow the League to interfere.\n\nBritain favored referring the Corfu matter to the League of Nations, but France opposed such a course of action fearing that it would provide a precedent for the League to become involved in the French occupation of the Ruhr.\n\nWith the threat of Mussolini to withdraw from the League and lack of French support the matter went to the Conference of Ambassadors. Italy's prestige was safeguarded and the French were relieved from any linkage between Corfu and the Ruhr at the League of Nations.\n\nOn September 8 the Conference of Ambassadors announced to both Greece and Italy, as well as to the League of Nations, the terms upon which the dispute should be settled.\n\nThe decision was that:\n\nBoth Greece, on September 8, and Italy, on September 10, accepted it. Italy added, however, that she would not evacuate the island until Greece had given full satisfaction.\n\nIn Italy the press widely reported satisfaction with the Conference's decision and praised Mussolini.\n\nOn September 11 the Greek delegate, Nikolaos Politis, informed the Council that Greece had deposited the 50,000,000 lire in a Swiss bank and on September 15, the Ambassadors Conference informed Mussolini that Italy must evacuate Corfu on the September 27, at the latest.\n\nOn September 26, before the inquiry had finished, the Conference of Ambassadors awarded Italy an indemnity of 50,000,000 lire, on the alleged ground that \"the Greek authorities had been guilty of a certain negligence before and after the crime.\"\n\nIn addition, Italy demanded from Greece 1,000,000 lire per day for the cost of the occupation of Corfu and Conference of the Ambassadors replied that Italy reserved the right of recourse to an International Court of Justice in connection with the occupation expenses.\n\nIn Greece there was a general depression over the decision, because Italy obtained practically everything she demanded.\n\nHarold Nicolson, a first secretary in the central department of the Foreign Office said: \"In response to the successive menaces of M. Mussolini we muzzled the League, we imposed the fine on Greece without evidence of her guilt and without reference to the Hague, and we disbanded the Commission of Enquiry. A settlement was thus achieved.\"\n\nOn September 27 the Italian flag was lowered and the Italian troops evacuated Corfu. The Italian fleet and a Greek destroyer saluted the Italian flag, and when the Greek flag hoisted, the Italian flagship saluted it.\n\n40,000 residents of Corfu welcomed the prefect when he landed, and shouldered him to the prefecture. British and French flags were waved by the crowd which demonstrated enthusiastically in front of the Anglo-French consulates.\n\nThe Italian squadron had been ordered to remain anchored till Italy received the 50 million lire.\n\nThe 50,000,000 lire deposited in a Swiss bank were at the disposal of The Hague Tribunal and the bank refused to transfer the money to Rome without the authority of the Greek National Bank, which was given on the evening of the same day.\n\nOn September 30, the Italian fleet, except one destroyer, departed.\n\nThe reputation of Mussolini in Italy was enhanced.\n\nIn Corfu during the first quarter of the 20th century, many Italian operas were performed at the Municipal Theatre of Corfu. This tradition came to a halt following the Corfu incident. After the bombardment, the theatre featured Greek operas as well as Greek theater performances by distinguished Greek actors such as Marika Kotopouli and .\n\nThe ulterior motive for the invasion was Corfu's strategic position at the entrance of the Adriatic Sea.\n\nThe crisis was the first major test for the League of Nations but the League failed it. It showed that the League was weak and couldn't settle disputes when a great power confronted a small one. The authority of the League had been openly defied by Italy, a founding member of the League and a permanent member of the Council. The Italian Fascist regime had managed to prevail in its first major international confrontation.\n\nThe crisis was also a failure for the policy of Great Britain, which had appeared as the greatest champion of the League during the crisis.\n\nIn addition, it showed the purpose and tone of Fascist foreign policy.\nItaly's invasion of Corfu was Mussolini's most aggressive move of the 1920s. \nThe reputation of Mussolini in Italy was enhanced.\n\nAs a consequence Mussolini started in the 1930s to claim the Italian irredentism of Corfu & the Ionian islands.\n\nAn Italian Post Office opened on September 11, 1923 in Corfu, issuing a set of 8 Italian stamps overprinted \"CORFÙ\" which were placed on sale on the 20th. Three additional stamps overprinted in Greek currency arrived on 24th. The third stamp was 2.40 drachma on 1 lire. \nThe Post Office closed at midday on 26 September 1923, only remaining open to dispatch the morning mail. The office had been open for 15 days.\n\nThree further values arrived on the day the Post Office closed, and were never issued. They eventually became available for sale at the postal ministry in Rome. Many used copies of these stamps have forged postmarks, but it is known that the Corfu cancel was applied to hundreds of stamps before the Post Office closed.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Eisenhower as the 34th President of the United States, delivered in a television broadcast on January 17, 1961. Perhaps best known for advocating that the nation guard against the potential influence of the military–industrial complex, a term he is credited with coining, the speech also expressed concerns about planning for the future and the dangers of massive spending, especially deficit spending, the prospect of the domination of science through Federal funding and, conversely, the domination of science-based public policy by what he called a \"scientific-technological elite\". This speech and Eisenhower's Chance for Peace speech have been called the \"bookends\" of his administration.\n\nOn January 20, 1961, Eisenhower served as a president for two full terms, making a total of eight years, and was the first U.S. president to be term-limited from seeking re-election again. He had overseen a period of considerable economic expansion, even as the Cold War deepened. Three of his national budgets had been balanced, but spending pressures mounted. The recent presidential election had resulted in the election of John F. Kennedy, and the oldest American president in a century was about to hand the reins of power to the youngest elected president.\n\nAs early as 1959, Eisenhower began working with his brother Milton and his speechwriters, including his chief speechwriter Malcolm Moos, to develop his final statement as he left public life. It went through at least 21 drafts. The speech was \"a solemn moment in a decidedly unsolemn time\", warning a nation \"giddy with prosperity, infatuated with youth and glamour, and aiming increasingly for the easy life.\"\n\nDespite being a politician with a military background and the only general to be elected president in the 20th century, he famously warned the nation with regards to the corrupting influence of what he describes as the \"military-industrial complex\". \n\nHe also expressed his concomitant concern for corruption of the scientific process as part of this centralization of funding in the Federal government:\n\nAlthough it was much broader, Eisenhower's speech is remembered primarily for its reference to the military-industrial complex. The phrase gained acceptance during the Vietnam War era and 21st-century commentators have expressed the opinion that a number of the fears raised in his speech have come true.\nThe speech has been adapted as an oratory for orchestra and orator. The speech was depicted in the opening of the 1991 film \"JFK\". Every episode title in the third season of \"Orphan Black\" was taken from the speech.\n\n"}

Thus, going out of the house after midnight and then coming back into the same house is not considered to be first-footing. It is said to be desirable for the first-foot to be a tall, dark-haired male; a female or fair-haired male are in some places regarded as unlucky. In Worcestershire, luck is ensured by stopping the first carol singer who appears and leading him through the house [ref]. In Yorkshire, it must always be a male who enters the house first, but his fairness is no objection.\n\nThe first-foot usually brings several gifts, including perhaps a coin (silver is considered good luck), bread, salt, coal, evergreen, and/or a drink (usually whisky), which represent financial prosperity, food, flavour, warmth, long-life, and good cheer respectively. In Scotland, first-footing has traditionally been more elaborate than in England, involving subsequent entertainment.\n\nThere are practices similar to first-footing outside the British isles. For example, it exists in Sweden, where having a fair skinned, blond(e) first-foot is considered the highest blessing whereas darker persons are considered bad luck. In a similar Greek tradition called pothariko, also called \"podariko\" (from the root \"pod-\", or foot), it is believed that the first person to enter the house on New Year's Eve brings either good or bad luck. Many households to this day keep this tradition and specially select who first enters the house. After the first-foot, the lady of the house serves the guests with Christmas treats or gives them an amount of money to ensure that good luck will come in the new year.\n\nA similar tradition exists in the country of Georgia, where the person is called \"mekvle\" (from \"kvali\" – footstep, footprint, trace).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "477535", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477535", "title": "Forced displacement", "text": "Forced displacement\n\nForced displacement or forced immigration is the coerced movement of a person or people away from their home or home region and it often connotes violent coercion. Someone who has experienced forced displacement is a \"forced immigrant\", a \"displaced person\" (DP), rarely also a \"displacee\", or if it is within the same country, an internally displaced person (IDP). In some cases the forced immigrant can also become a refugee, as that term has a specific legal definition. A specific form of forced displacement is population transfer, which is a coherent policy to move unwanted groups, for example, as an attempt at ethnic cleansing. Another form is deportation.\n\nForced displacement has accompanied persecution, as well as war, throughout human history but has only become a topic of serious study and discussion relatively recently. This increased attention is the result of greater ease of travel, allowing displaced people to flee to nations far removed from their homes, the creation of an international legal structure of human rights, and the realizations that the destabilizing effects of forced immigration, especially in parts of Africa, the Middle East, south and central Asia, ripple out well beyond the immediate region.\n\nThe concept of forced displacement envelopes demographic movements like flight, evacuation, displacement, and resettlement. The International Organization for Migration defines a forced migrant as any person who migrates to \"escape persecution, conflict, repression, natural and human-made disasters, ecological degradation, or other situations that endanger their lives, freedom or livelihood\".\n\nThe International Association for the Study of Forced Migration (IASFM) defines it as \"the movements of refugees and internally displaced people (those displaced by conflicts) as well as people displaced by natural or environmental disasters, chemical or nuclear disasters, famine, or development projects.\"\n\nAccording to Alden Speare, \"in the strictest sense migration can be considered to be involuntary only when a person is physically transported from a country and has no opportunity to escape from those transporting him.\" Movement under threat, even the immediate threat to life, contains a voluntary element, as long as there is an option to escape to another part of the country, go into hiding or to remain and hope to avoid persecution.\" However this thought has been questioned, especially by Marxians, who argue that in most cases migrants have little or no choice.\n\nCauses for forced displacement can include:\n\nIn the majority of cases forced migration across borders takes place without the required documentation. It may even involve human smugglers and traffickers. Displaced people often place their lives at risk, are obliged to travel in inhumane conditions and may be exposed to exploitation and abuse. And on top of that the states where they seek protection may regard them as a threat to their security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForced displacement has been subjected to several trials before local and international courts. One of the requirements that need to be met for an offence as a war crime is that the victim is a \"protected person\" under international humanitarian law. The expression \"protected person\" originally referred only to the categories of individuals explicitly protected under one of the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, but was later accepted as defining a civilian or police force who do not participate directly in a conflict. Following the end of World War II, the Krupp trial was held with a specific charge to the forced displacement of civilian populations for the purpose of forced labour. The US Military Tribunal concluded that \"\n[t]here is no international law that permits the deportation or the use of civilians against their will for other than on reasonable requisitions for the need of the army, either within the area of the army or after deportation to rear areas or to the homeland of the occupying power\". At the Nuremberg trials, Hans Frank, chief jurist in occupied Poland, was found guilty, among others for forced displacement of the civilian population. \n\nIn Article 49, the Fourth Geneva Convention, adopted on 12 August 1949, specifically forbids forced displacement:\n\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court defines forced displacement as a crime within the jurisdiction of the court:\nSeveral people were tried and convicted by the ICTY for connection to forced displacement during the Yugoslav Wars in the 1990s. On 11 April 2018, the Appeals Chamber sentenced Vojislav Šešelj 10 years in prison under Counts 1, 10, and 11 of the indictment for instigating deportation, persecution (forcible displacement), and other inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity due to his speech in Hrtkovci on 6 May 1992, in which he called for the expulsion of Croats from Vojvodina. Other convictions for forced displacement included ex-Bosnian Serb politician Momčilo Krajišnik, ex-Croatian Serb leader Milan Martić, former Bosnian Croat paramilitary commander Mladen Naletilić, and Bosnian Serb politician Radoslav Brđanin.\n\n\n\n"}

It is based on the story of Francesca da Rimini in the fifth canto of Dante's epic poem \"The Inferno\" (the first part of the \"Divine Comedy\"). The fifth canto is the part about the Second Circle of Hell (Lust). Rachmaninoff had composed the love duet for Francesca and Paolo in 1900, but did not resume work on the opera until 1904. The first performance was on 24 January (O.S. 11 January) 1906 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, with the composer himself conducting, in a double-bill performance with another Rachmaninoff opera written contemporaneously, \"The Miserly Knight\".\n\n\"The setting is the Malatesta castle around the end of the 13th century\"\n\nThe ghost of Virgil leads the poet Dante to the edge of the first circle of the Inferno. They descend into the second, where the wordless chorus of the damned souls is heard. Virgil tells Dante that this is the realms where sinners given over to lust are punished, buffeted by an eternal whirlwind. Dante asks two such souls, Francesca and Paolo, to tell their story.\n\nIn the castle courtyard, Lanceotto Malatesta is about to go off to war, but he admits that he no longer takes pleasure in war. Lanceotto is deformed, and knows that his wife, Francesca, does not love him. She had been tricked into marrying Lanceotto by being led to think that she would marry Paolo Malatesta, Lanceotto's handsome younger brother. Lanceotto is suspicious of Francesca and envious of Paolo. He plans to set a trap to catch them in adultery. Francesca then enters, affirming obedience to Lanceotto, but saying that she cannot love him. She asks when he will return, and Lanceotto says that he will not return until after the end of battle. When Francesca leaves, Lanceotto laughs. \n\nPaolo and Francesca are together, alone, in a room in the castle. Paolo tells the story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere, which parallels their own feelings. While doing so, Paolo declares his love for Francesca. Francesca resists initially, trying to remain faithful to Lanciotto. However, her own resistance erodes at Paolo's continued expressions of love, and her own desire for him. They sing of their secret love, and embrace. Lanciotto has returned, and sees the lovers together. He fatally stabs Paolo and Francesca.\n\nPaolo and Francesca recede into the whirlwind of the second circle. Dante is overcome with pity and terror, and he and Virgil remain with the thought: ‘There is no greater sadness in the world than to remember a time of joy in a time of grief’.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "21422806", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21422806", "title": "Great Recession in Europe", "text": "Great Recession in Europe\n\nThe European recession is part of the Great Recession, which began inside the United States. The crisis spread to Europe rapidly and affected much of the region with several countries already in recession as of February 2009, and most others suffering marked economic setbacks. The global recession was first seen in Europe, as Ireland was the first country to fall in a recession from Q2-Q3 2007 – followed by temporary growth in Q4 2007 – and then a two-year-long recession.\n\nThe Eurozone recession has been dated from the first quarter of 2008 to the second quarter of 2009. In the eurozone as a whole, industrial production fell 1.9 percent in May 2008, the sharpest one-month decline for the region since the exchange rate crisis in 1992. European car sales fell 7.8 percent in May compared with a year earlier. Retail sales fell by 0.6 percent in June from the May level and by 3.1 percent from June in the previous year. Germany was the only country out of the four biggest economies in the eurozone to register an increase of activity in July though the increase was sharply down. Economic analysts from RBS and capital Economics say the decline raises the risk of the eurozone entering a recession in 2008. In the second quarter, the eurozone's economy was reported to have declined by 0.2 percent.\n\nThe global recession was first seen in Europe, as Ireland was the first country to fall in a recession from Q2-Q3 2007 – followed by temporary growth in Q4 2007 – and then a two-year-long recession. Republic of Ireland in the first quarter of 2008 reported a contraction in GDP of 1.5 percent, its first economic contraction since it began reporting by quarter and first recorded contraction since 1983. However, Ireland's Central Statistics Office reported growth in GNP of about 0.8 percent, Ireland's government considers GNP a better measure of the economy. Analysts have predicted Ireland's economy will contract further in the rest of the year. A report from NCB Stockbrokers predicts gross national product will fall by 1 percent in 2008 and by 0.4 percent in 2009 due to a decline in multinationals hit by the global economic slowdown. An economist from NCB said non-residential investment would fall by 5 percent in 2008 and by 12 percent in 2009.\n\nIreland's GDP saw a contraction in the second quarter by 0.5 percent, making Ireland the first member of the eurozone to enter a recession. The government is being advised by Merrill Lynch, the American broker that ran out of capital in September 2008. In January 2009 it was forced to nationalise its third largest bank, Anglo Irish Bank and to announce recapitalisation of its top two banks, AIB and Bank of Ireland. In February 2009, the government announced record unemployment levels in the country, with its highest monthly increase in 40 years and 1,500 people being laid off daily.\nIreland exited the recession in the 3rd quarter of 2009, posting a 0.3% growth in its economy, due to recent heavy budget cuts by the Irish government. However, although they technically exited recession, the Irish economy still has a lot of hurdles to overcome if it is to return to normality.\n\nSpain's Martinsa-Fadesa, a construction company, declared bankruptcy after failing to refinance a debt of €5.1 billion. The two banks with most exposure to Martinsa-Fadesa were reportedly Caja Madrid, at €900m, and Banco Popular Español, at €400m. Spain's finance minister Pedro Solbes said it would not bail out the company. In the second quarter, house prices in Spain fell 20 percent. In Castilla-La Mancha some 69 percent of all houses built over the past three years are still unsold. Deutsche Bank said it expects a 35 percent fall in real house prices by 2011. Spain's premier, Jose Luis Zapatero, blamed the European Central Bank for making matters worse by raising interest rates. More than 98 percent of home loans in Spain are priced off floating rates linked to Euribor, which has risen 145 basis points since August. Housing accounts for over 10 percent of Spain's economy. The Bank of Spain is concerned about the health of smaller regional lenders with heavy exposure to the mortgage market.\n\nAlthough Spain has avoided recession in the first half of 2008, unemployment in the country has risen by 425,000 over 2007-2008, reaching 9.9 percent. Car sales in Spain fell 31 percent in May. Spain's factory output slumped 5.5 percent in May 2008. The country's business lobby Circulo de Empresarios warned of a \"high probability\" that Spain's economy would fall into recession in the second half of 2008 due to the housing collapse. Spain had a 7.9 percent decline in retail sales in June compared to the previous year, the largest drop since Spain began registering the results and the seventh consecutive monthly decline. This included a 17.9 percent drop in retail sales of household goods. June food sales in Spain fell by 6.8 percent.\n\nMorgan Stanley issued a major alert on the health of Spanish banks and the Spanish economy in a report, saying, \"A momentous economic slowdown is now under way. We believe the deterioration in Spain is just in the beginning stages. The bulk of the pain will be suffered in 2009.\" Morgan Stanley also warned there was 40 percent chance of a 0.5 percent contraction of the Spanish economy in 2009, with a risk of an even more extreme 1.4 percent contraction in 2009. According to Spanish automobile manufacturers' association ANFAC new car sales fell 27.5 percent in July from the same time in 2007, the third consecutive monthly drop of over 20 percent. Spain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 10.4 percent in 2008 and to 12.5 percent in 2009. Spain's second largest bank BBVA predicted the unemployment rate could reach 14 percent in 2009. Spain's Purchasing Managers Index for the manufacturing sector in July fell to a new low suggesting a deep recession. In the second quarter Spain's economy grew by 0.1 percent, the lowest gain in 15 years.\n\nAs of December 2009, Spain's government forecast the unemployment rate would rise to 20 percent in 2009. It's predicted a 25% rate, due to the way the tally is carried out by the government. According to Spain's Finance Minister, the \"Spain faces its deepest recession in half a century\".\n\nIn Germany officials had warned the economy could contract by as much as 1.5 percent in the second quarter because of declining export orders. The economy of Germany indeed contracted in both the second and third quarters putting Germany now in a technical recession. Although the idea was fought for a moment Angela Merkel and the German government approved a €50 billion strong rescue plan to protect the German economy of the crisis, making of it Western Europe's biggest rescue plan for now in this crisis.\n\nGermany's industrial output was down 2.4 percent in May, the fastest rate for a decade. Orders have now fallen for six months in a row, the worst run since the early 1990s. The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce warned of up to 200,000 job losses in coming months. German retails sales fell 1.4 percent in June more than any expectations. The German economy declined by 0.5 percent in the second quarter.\n\nIn 2012 Greece entered its 5th year of recession. In 2011 Greece's GDP shrunk by a further 6.8%, leaving total economic output now 16% below the pre-crisis peak. Eurostat's current forecasts also show Greece's economy declining further in 2012, by an estimated 4.4%\n\nIn Italy, Fiat announced plant closures and temporary layoffs at factories in Turin, Melfi and Sicily. Car sales in Italy have fallen by almost 20 percent over each of the past two months. Italy's car workers' union said; \"The situation is evidently more serious than had been understood.\" On 10 July 2008 economic think tank ISAE lowered its growth forecast for Italy to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent and cut the 2009 outlook to 0.7 percent from 1.2 percent. Analysts have predicted Italy had entered a recession in the second quarter or would enter one by the end of the year with business confidence at its lowest levels since the September 11 attacks. Italy's economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the second quarter of 2008.\n\nThe unemployment rate rose from 5.7% in April 2007 to 8.6% in April 2010. Italy was mostly isolated from the effects of the Great Recession of 2008-2009 as their banking system did not engage in risky investment behavior and was sound. However, the effects of the recession wiped out the strict budget discipline that Italy had painstakingly kept since the Debt Crisis of 1992, and lead to another Italian sovereign debt crisis in 2011. Italy briefly saw growth from 2009-2011, but from 2011 to 2013 suffered a recession that, while shallower than the 2008-2009 downturn, was longer and in many ways far worse, as unemployment skyrocketed 7.9% in April 2011 to 13.0% in November 2014.\n\nOther eurozone members saw a decline in their economies in the second quarter as well; France by 0.3 percent, Finland by 0.2 percent while the Netherlands showed zero growth in the second quarter. However the final estimates released by the INSEE, France's statistical agency, showed the French economy grew by 0.14 percent during the third quarter thus barely avoiding a technical recession. In the first quarter of 2009, France fell into recession, the last developed nation in Europe to do so.\n\nIn order to fight the economic crisis, French president Nicolas Sarkozy announced a €26 billion rescue plan which will amount to an additional €15.5 billion in addition to the normal budget for 2009 and will increase France's public deficit to 4%. It is similar, to an extent, to Barack Obama's proposal to stimulate the U.S. economy by investing in the nation's vital infrastructure. Further proposals include tax rebates for small businesses as well as easing restrictions on building permits and government contracts particularly with construction and civil engineering.\nThis is due to the \"prime à la casse\" program where buyers received a rebate of up to €1,000 for scrapping their polluting old vehicles and purchasing new environmentally friendly/ fuel efficient cars. As a consequence, car sales in France in December 2008 were 30% higher than in December 2007 although on the total 2008 year the sales was down 0.7%. Because the French new cars market fared better than most as well as increased sales in South America, French brands, particularly Renault, now have bigger shares of the world's market despite selling fewer cars in 2008 than in 2007. Another highly exposed industry is naval construction, an order concerning a packet boat for NCL was already cancelled.\n\nIn order to fill the blank in the construction planning the French government is expected to order soon a third Mistral BPC, as well as smaller ships, for the French navy to DCNS. This is part of the Sarkozy's rescue plan. DCNS also won its biggest export contract ever when the Brazilian government placed a €7 billion large order to the company. The order concerns four Scorpène class submarine with a conventional propulsion and a fifth one with a nuclear propulsion, as well as a naval shipyard and a naval base.\n\nThe French cooperative bank Caisse d'Epargne suffered a €600 million derivatives trading loss in October 2008, which it blamed partly on the high market volatility at the time. The group of employees responsible for making the unauthorised trades were dismissed. French banks have also been affected to some point by the fraud set by Bernard Madoff. Most importantly Natixis, an investment bank, potentially lost €450 million in the process and BNP Paribas could lose €350 million. Neither Natixis or BNP Paribas directly invested in Madoff's but through bonds issued by the US treasury they could face such loses. It is to be determined if all of these are effectively lost, which ones can be recovered and what can be saved by legal procedures. Other groups like AXA, Société Générale, Crédit Agricole and Groupama could also face loses to some point.\n\nOn 28 September 2008, Dutch-Belgian bank Fortis was partially nationalized with a cash infusion from the Benelux countries amounting to €11.2 billion. Fortis' troubles started in the beginning of the year with an announcement that it faced around $1.5bn of losses in the American sub-prime catastrophe. In June, the company announced a selloff of assets to raise €5 bn to improve the liquidity of the organisation. This, however, proved insufficient. On 6 October 2008, it was announced the French bank BNP Paribas would take over 75 percent of Fortis' activities in Belgium, and 66 percent in Luxembourg, in exchange for the Belgian government becoming the new group's major shareholder.\n\nHowever the Belgian government was accused of pressuring shareholders and collapsed over the controversy thus delaying the operation. A new proposition was made on 30 January 2009 with slightly different terms. BNP Paribas would take over 75% of Fortis' banking activities in Belgium and only 10% of the insurance activities in return of what the Belgian government would take 11.7% of BNP Paribas. This agreement would come with a warranty from the Belgian government that it would cover up to €5 billion if more toxic assets were to be discovered. On 30 September 2008 the Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments said they would invest €6.4bn into keeping Dexia, Belgium's second largest bank, afloat.\n\nIn May 2008 industrial output fell in the Netherlands by 6 percent.\n\nOn 19 March 2009, the INSEE announced worse contraction than previously said, predicting a −2.9% set back in growth, and a jobless rate up to 8.8 as soon as June 2009.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, Moody's Investors Service cut Portugal's sovereign bond rating down two notches from an Aa2 to an A1. Due to spending on economic stimuli, Portugal's debt had increased sharply compared to the gross domestic product. Moody noted that the rising debt would weigh heavily on the government's short-term finances. Earlier in the year, Portugal was one of the countries identified in the European sovereign-debt crisis as concern spread over increasing government deficit and debt levels in certain countries.\n\nAlso in 2010, the country reached a record high unemployment rate of nearly 11%, a figure not seen for over two decades, while the number of public servants remained very high.\n\nInternational financial markets compelled the Portuguese Government led by Prime Minister José Sócrates, to make radical changes in economic policy, like other European governments had done before. Thus, in September 2010, the Portuguese Government announced a fresh austerity package following other Eurozone partners, through a series of tax hikes and salary cuts for public servants. In 2009, the deficit had been 9.4 percent, one of the highest in the Eurozone and way above the European Union's Stability and Growth Pact three percent limit.\n\nIn November 2010, risk premiums on Portuguese bonds hit euro lifetime highs as investors and creditors worried that the country would fail to reign in its budget deficit and debt. The yield on the country's 10-year government bonds reached 7 percent – a level the Portuguese Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos had previously said would require the country to seek financial help from international institutions.\n\nA report published in January 2011 by the Diário de Notícias, a leading Portuguese newspaper, demonstrated that in the period between the Carnation Revolution in 1974 and 2010, the democratic Portuguese Republic governments had encouraged over expenditure and investment bubbles through unclear public-private partnerships. This had funded numerous ineffective and unnecessary external consultancy and advising committees and firms, allowed considerable slippage in state-managed public works, inflated top management and head officers' bonuses and wages, causing a persistent and lasting recruitment policy that has boosted the number of redundant public servants. The economy has also been damaged by risky credit, public debt creation and mismanaged European structural and cohesion funds for almost four decades. Apparently, the Prime Minister Sócrates's cabinet was not able to forecast or prevent any of this when symptoms first appeared in 2005, and later was incapable of doing anything to ameliorate the situation when the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 2011.\n\nOn 23 March 2011, José Sócrates resigned following passage of a no confidence motion sponsored by all five opposition parties in parliament over spending cuts and tax increases.\n\nOn 6 April 2011, the resigning Prime Minister announced on the television that the country, facing a status of bankruptcy, would request financial assistance to the IMF (at the time managed by Dominique Strauss-Kahn) and the European Financial Stability Facility, like Greece and the Republic of Ireland had done before.\n\nIn order to accomplish the European Union/IMF-led rescue plan for Portugal's sovereign debt crisis, in July and August 2011, the new government led by Pedro Passos Coelho announced it was going to cut on state spending and increase austerity measures, including public servant wage cuts and additional tax increases.\n\nThe entire economy of the European Union declined by 0.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008. A European Commission forecast predicted Germany, Spain and the UK would all enter a recession by the end of the year while France and Italy would have flat growth in the third quarter following second quarter contractions.\n\nDenmark showed a contraction of 0.6 percent in the first quarter of 2008 following a contraction of 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007. Revised data for Denmark, however cancelled the early recession, as GDP ended at +1.0% in Q4 2007 followed by -1.4% in Q1 2008 and +1.5% in Q2 2008. So according to revised data, the Great Recession only started in Denmark in Q3 2008.\n\nLatvia's gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent in the second quarter following a fall of 0.3 percent in the first quarter.\n\nEconomists at Switzerland's second-largest bank predicted a recession in 2009.\n\nEstonia saw an economic contraction of 0.9 percent in the second quarter of 2008, following a 0.5 percent contraction in the first quarter, but with the revised data showing no recession before Q3 2008.\n\nChairwoman of the Association of Estonian Food Industry, Sirje Potisepp, warned the Estonian food industry would probably face bankruptcies citing two major beverage companies in Estonia filing for bankruptcy.\n\nSlovakia was one of only a few countries that retained their high GDP predictions for the year 2008.\n\nPoland is the only member of the European Union to have avoided recession, meaning that in 2009 Poland created the most GDP growth in the EU. As of December 2009 the Polish economy had not entered recession nor contracted, while its International Monetary Fund (IMF) 2010 GDP growth forecast of 1.9 per cent is expected to be upgraded. In the second quarter of 2010, growth was at least 3.1 per cent. As of 30 August 2010, the EU's GDP growth forecast for Poland in 2010 stands at 2.7 per cent, outperforming the EU average of 1 per cent. Poland has one of the lowest external debt rates in the European Union, at just over 320 billion, 46% of its GDP.\n\nThe Icelandic króna has declined 40% against the euro during 2008 and has experienced inflation of 14%. Iceland's interest rates have been raised to 15.5% to deal with the high inflation. This loss of currency value has put pressure on banks in Iceland, which are largely dependent on foreign debt. On 29 September 2008 Iceland's Glitnir was effectively nationalized after the Icelandic government acquired 75% of the bank's stock. According to the government the bank \"would have ceased to exist\" within a few weeks if there had not been intervention.\n\nIceland's Prime Minister Geir Haarde in a television address on 6 October 2008 said credit lines to Icelandic banks had been cut off and that \"the Icelandic economy, in the worst case, could be sucked with the banks into the whirlpool and the result could be national bankruptcy\" and that the government was looking to other countries for sources of liquidity. Iceland's parliament responded to the crisis by approving a bill giving the Government wideranging powers over the banks, including the ability to seize their assets, force them to merge or compel them to sell off their overseas subsidiaries. The parliament went on to seize control and nationalize Iceland's second largest bank, Landsbanki, on 8 October 2008. The Parliament also extended a £400m loan to the nation's largest bank, Kaupthing, in hopes that it would strengthen the institution's balance sheet.\n\nOn 8 October 2008 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown announced that the UK government would launch legal action against Iceland, whose government announced that they had no intention of compensating any of the estimated 300,000 UK savers after the nationalization of Landsbanki and its online brand, Icesave. Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling announced that the UK government would foot the entire bill, estimated at £4bn, and that he was taking steps to freeze the assets of Landsbanki. The following day, Darling used the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 as the basis for seizing the assets of Landsbanki Islands hf, an Iceland-based bank. Icelanders launched an on-line petition drive to protest this action, which is seen as comparing Icelandic banks with Al-Qaida.\n\nIceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink at least 10 percent as a result of the crisis, putting Iceland by some measure in an economic depression.\n\nOn 27 January 2009 the government collapsed.\n\nOn 10 October 2008, the Forint dropped by 10%. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced on 16 October that it was bailing out Hungary with a 5 billion euro (US$6.7 billion) loan facility, just days after the Hungarian Finance Ministry said it was seeking consultations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about a possible support package. The ECB's unprecedented move in bailing out a non-euro state underlines the crisis unraveling in Hungary and its possible impact on the rest of Central Europe. Several players will be affected, but at particular risk are the Austrian banks which invested so heavily in the region. A potential serious hiccup of the Austrian banks could mark a significant blow to Europe's already troubled banking system.\n\nHungary, which joined the European Union in 2004, has been hit hard by the current financial crisis due to its heavy dependence on foreign capital to finance its economy and has one of the biggest public deficits in the EU. Prior to the international bailout, the government had feared the worst, including a collapse of the national currency, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány said.\n\nIn November Hungary has received a $25 billion cash injection from the International Monetary Fund to save it from financial collapse. In December, the IMF transferred $5 billion and the ECB $2 billion.\n\nOn 10 June 2009 Bulgarian authorities declared the country was officially in recession with its economy shrinking 4.2 percent from January to June. The Bulgarian economy contracted by 4.8 percent year-on-year in the second quarter for the first time in 12 years. Unemployment is rising rapidly. The agriculture sector registered a 6.6-percent decline in activity in the second quarter of 2009 compared to the same period last year, while industry shrank by 9.8 percent. The services sector meanwhile grew by 0.3 percent. Bulgaria's imports during the first half of this year compared to January–June 2008 contracted by 24.2 percent and exports declined by 18.2 percent.\n\nThe economy of the United Kingdom has also been hit by rising oil prices and the credit crisis. Sir Win Bischoff, chairman of Citigroup, spoke of his belief that house prices in Britain would fall constantly for two years from the end of 2007. The Ernst & Young Item club predicted growth of only 1.5 percent in 2008, slowing to 1 percent in 2009. They also predicted consumer spending would slow to only 0.2 percent, and forecast a two-year drop in investment. The Institute of Directors’ quarterly business opinion survey showed business optimism at its lowest level since the survey began in 1996.\n\nDeputy Governor of the Bank of England, John Gieve, said inflation would accelerate \"well over\" 4 percent while economic growth is \"slowing fast.\" Bank of England Governor Mervyn King said there may be \"an odd quarter or two of negative growth,\" following the first quarter of 2009. Gieve said he couldn't rule out the UK economy heading into a recession, adding the economy was \"quite a long way\" from the end of the slowdown.\n\nNationwide, the UK's biggest building society, warned the UK could head into a recession after house prices in July 2008 fell 8.1 percent from the previous year. Housing prices declined by 1.7 percent in July, double the decline recorded in June. Standard & Poor's said on 30 July 2008 that 70,000 homeowners were in negative equity and it could rise to 1.7 million or about one in six homeowners in the UK based on an expected 17 percent decline into 2009. The Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals fell by a record of nearly 70 percent.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, house sales saw a fall of some 50 per cent according to a survey by the University of Ulster/Bank of Ireland and housing prices fell on average by 4 percent. British manufacturing activity declined by the most in almost a decade in July, the third consecutive month of declines.\n\nThe number of companies that went into administration in May–July 2008 was 938, an increase of 60 percent compared with the same period in 2007. The number of company liquidations in the second quarter of 2008 rose to 3,689, a 16 percent increase and the highest quarterly figure in five years. House builders expected the number of houses built in 2008 in England and Wales to be the lowest since 1924. The declines were seen as an indication the United Kingdom had a high chance of entering a recession. Factory production in the UK dropped 0.5 percent in June 2008 when twelve out of 13 categories of factory production fell. The economic output of the UK was reported to have increased by just 0.2 percent in the second quarter 2008, the joint-slowest pace since 2001.\n\nThe value of sterling relative to other currencies dropped by around 30%.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics later gave a revised number saying growth in the British economy was at zero, the worst since the second quarter of 1992. The current slowdown has ended 16 years of continuous economic growth, the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century. A report from the National Institute for Economic and Social Research said the economy contracted by 0.1 percent in the period from May to July 2008 and 0.2 percent from June to August 2008.\n\nA voter backlash due to the personal financial effects of the global credit crunch was widely attributed by politicians of the United Kingdom Labour Party, which had been in power since 1997, as the reason their political fortunes took a dramatic downturn through May 2008, with a succession of defeats in by-elections and the London Mayoral election, and the worst opinion poll result in their history. Political opponents countered this apparent excuse by pointing to the fact that the incumbent Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who had taken office in June 2007 just before the crisis broke, had been the country's 'Iron Chancellor', and had allegedly not ensured the country had sufficient monetary reserves to be able to lower taxes and ease the burden on voters, despite overseeing one of the longest sustained periods of economic growth in the country's history. In August 2008 the party also faced calls to impose a windfall tax on the utility companies, who were reaping record profits due to the fuel crisis, perceived as in bad taste given rising food and fuel prices.\n\nOn 17 September 2008, news emerged that the banking and insurance group HBOS (Halifax Bank of Scotland) was in merger talks with Lloyds TSB about creating a UK retail banking giant worth £30bn. The move received the backing of the British government which stated that it will over-rule any claims from the competition authorities.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics unemployment claims in August 2008 increased by 32,500 to reach 904,900. The wider Labour Force Survey measure found joblessness rose by 81,000 to 1.72 million between May and July, the largest increase since 1999.\n\nIn September 2008, British bank Bradford & Bingley's £20 billion savings business was acquired by Spanish bank Grupo Santander. While its retail deposit business along with its branch network will be sold to Santander. The mortgage book, personal loan book, headquarters, treasury assets and its wholesale liabilities will be taken into public ownership.\n\nFrom 1 December 2008, the UK Government made the decision to cut VAT from 17.5% to 15% for 13 months in an attempt to encourage a big spend from UK shoppers before Christmas, and again in the run-up to Christmas 2009.\n\nOn 4 December 2008, the Bank of England cut interest rates from 3% to 2%, which amounted to the lowest level since 1951.\n\nOn 8 January 2009, the Bank of England reduced rates even further, from 2% to 1.5%, the lowest level in the its 315-year history.\n\nOn 23 January 2009, Government figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the UK was officially in recession for the first time since 1991; with a 1.5% fall in gross domestic product during the final quarter of 2008 being the sharpest for 28 years.\n\nOn 5 February 2009 interest rates were cut further from 1.5% to 1%.\n\nA February 2009 research on the main British insurers showed that most of them are not considering officially raising insurance premiums for the year 2009, in spite of the 20% raise predictions made by The Daily Telegraph or The Daily Mirror. However, it is expected that the capital liquidity will become an issue and determine increases, having their capital tied up in investments yielding smaller dividends, corroborated with the £644 million underwriting losses suffered in 2007.\n\nOn 5 March 2009, the Bank of England cut interest rates yet again, from 1% to 0.5%. The same week, it announced that it would begin a policy of quantitative easing, printing up to £150 billion of new money.\n\nFigures published in March 2009 by the Bank of England revealed that over $1 trillion in foreign holdings had been withdrawn from UK banks between spring and the end of 2008, representing a huge loss of confidence in UK financial institutions.\n\nBy November 2008, unemployment had risen to over 1.8 million (compared to less than 1.7 million at the start of the year and less than 1.5 million as recently as 2005) and by early 2009 had exceeded 2 million, the highest since 1996. It was feared that unemployment could reach 3 million during 2010 – a level not seen since the 1980s. However, the end of the recession in the United Kingdom was declared on 26 January 2010, by which time unemployment stood at nearly 2.5 million. A peak of almost 2.7 million was reached in late 2011.\n\nA report by the ONS produced in March 2009 stated that the UK economy shrank by 1.6 percent during the last quarter of 2008, with a 1% drop in household spending. A further decline of up to 4% GDP during 2009 was predicted.\n\nIn April 2009, it was reported that first quarter GDP had shrunk by 1.9 percent, with a prediction of a 4.1 percent drop for the year. The largest contributor to this figure was manufacturing output, which fell by 6.9 percent over the quarter.\n\nIn May 2009, Standard & Poor's cut its rating outlook for the UK to negative. Official figures also showed that British public borrowing hit a record high for the month of April, the first month of the new tax year – net public borrowing came in at £8.5bn in April 2009, compared to April 2008's figure of £1.8bn\n\nIn June 2009, the figure for the first quarter GDP drop was revised downwards from 1.9 to 2.4 percent, with economic output falling 4.1% from the previous year. Revised figures also showed that the recession began in Q2 of 2008, rather than Q3 of 2008 as previously reported.\n\nIn the 3 months to May 2009, the unemployment rate showed a record quarterly rise of 281,000 to stand at 2.38 million – which represented 7.6% of the working population. In the three months to June, the number of job vacancies fell to a record low of 429,000, down by 35,000 from the previous quarter.\n\nBy the end of June 2009, the public sector debt stood at £798.8 billion, equivalent to 56.6% of GDP, the highest percentage since records began in 1974. This compared to £641.4 billion or 44.4% of GDP in June 2008. The figure is expected to rise still higher when the costs of bailing out RBS and LLoyds Bank are added.\n\nBy August 2009, UK unemployment stood at more than 2.4 million, the highest since 1995. The Bank of England announced that due to the deepening recession in the UK, it would be extending its quantitative easing program to a new total of £175 billion. In November 2009, The Bank of England announced it would be adding a further £25 billion in continuation of quantitative easing in assisting the UK economy through the recession.\n\nIn December 2009, it was revealed that the UK's unemployment total stood at almost 2.5 million – another monthly rise and the highest level for 15 years – but the number of people claiming unemployment benefit had actually fallen by more than 6,000. By this stage, the UK was one of the last major economies still in recession. However, on 26 February 2010 it was revealed that the UK economy had grown by 0.3% within the last quarter of 2009 and the UK was out of recession.\n\nHowever, many economists were still unsure of the situation – the relatively small drop in unemployment benefit claimants could be attributed to seasonal jobs, and with a general election imminent, the government had every reason to present the best economic picture possible. Other factors which could have produced an artificially high growth rate included the end of the \"cash-for-clunkers\" car replacement scheme, and the ending of a VAT cut from 15% to 17.5% in January causing many consumers to push forward their purchases. In addition, £200 billion had been pumped into the economy via QE, and the central bank rate had been held at almost 0% for most of the year. Thus although official figures showed that the UK had indeed exited recession fears of a double-dip recession remained. According to the IMF, the UK economy had grown slower than that of Portugal or Italy in 2010.\n\nThe popularity of Britain's Labour government, led by prime minister Gordon Brown since June 2007, slumped dramatically during 2008 and 2009, with low rankings in opinion polls, dismal performances in local and European elections, and losing several seats in parliamentary by-elections. The Conservative opposition, led by David Cameron, won the most votes and seats in the 2010 general election, but fell short of an overall majority, and agreed a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in order to form a new government. The new government faced numerous economic challenges, namely re-establishing economic growth, reducing the national deficit and reducing unemployment, not to mention a host of social problems, many of which had been intensified as a result of the recession.\n\nDespite high economic growth in 2008 (8.7%), Romania was affected very hard by the crisis, analysts forecasting a contraction of 8–9% for 2009, as the new government established in the late 2008 was unable to take any anti-crisis measures.\n\nRomania's economy has been one of the hardest hit in Europe. The country's trade deficit fell by more than 60 percent during the first half of 2009, but not because of exports taking off, but due to business bankruptcies and unemployment decreasing consumption.\n\nFrom 1999 until the autumn of 2008 Russia's economy grew at a steady pace, which most experts attributed to Putin's policies, a sharp rouble devaluation of 1998, Boris Yeltsin-era structural reforms, rising oil price and cheap credit from western banks. After Vladimir Putin's first term as president (during most of which Mikhail Kasyanov held prime-ministership), some analysts described Russia's short-term economic growth as impressive and maintained that Putin was \"at least partially responsible for it\": a series of fundamental reforms had been implemented, including a flat income tax of 13 percent, a reduced profits tax, and new land and legal codes.\n\nIn October 2008 Russia emerged as one of the countries hardest-hit by the global economic crisis, the stock market crash having been precipitated by Vladimir Putin's verbal attack on Mechel in July that year and Russian peacekeepers' aid to the South Ossetian Republic in August.\n\nIn 2008, Russia's benchmark RTS share index lost 72.4 percent, ranking it as an unusual performer of all major emerging markets.\n\nIn January 2009, Russia's State Statistics Service released data, according to which the Russian industrial production slumped in December 2008 by 10.3 percent after falling 8.7 percent in November that year.\n\nHowever, the Russian main stock exchange index has doubled by autumn 2009, compared to the end 2008, and, by the end of 2009, has almost reached the pre-crisis levels.\n\nSweden has not been severely affected, and no banks or financial institutions have had real trouble. However, some effects have been visible, mostly based on distrust and similar psychological mechanisms. The stockmarket has declined heavily, because of influence from New York and other markets. Some banks, especially Swedbank had invested heavily in US housing bonds.\n\nThe banks did not trust each other well and the difference between the interbank interest rate and the state interest rate has gone up at least 1%. The housing loan interest rates have gone up even further. The global sales especially of cars has gone down, forcing the Swedish car industry to lay off staff and contractors. The increased fear of enduring recession and the increased financing costs have lowered company investments and private consumption.\n\nSweden entered recession after a two consecutive quarter of economic contraction. Sweden's economy showed zero growth in the second quarter of 2008.\nThe Swedish GDP contracted by 0,1% during both the second and third quarters of 2008. Sweden's economy sank into recession in the third quarter of 2008. In October retail sales dropped 0.6 percent in the month, and household consumption fell 0.2 percent in the third quarter. The Riksbank offered 60 billion kronor ($7.71 billion) in loans to financial firms at an auction, after having opened credit facilities to maintain the liquidity in the banking sector. At the beginning of December, the government launched a financial stability package to rev up the economy, while the central bank, urged by the OECD, cut down its interest rates to 2%\n\nRatings agency Fitch warned Ukraine could be headed for a currency crisis as economic fundamentals deteriorate and the country enters another period of political uncertainty. Fitch said the current account deficit was likely to widen further as prices of gas imports rise and prices of its steel exports fall and said Ukraine was likely to need to borrow more at a time when global debt markets have ground to a virtual standstill. Ukraine's central bank chief, Petro Poroshenko, said he saw no need to intervene to protect the currency.\n\nUkraine was hit heavy by the economic crisis of 2008, analysts say the plights of Ukraine are slumping steel prices, local banking problems and the cutting of Russian gas supply in January 2009. Key industries such as metallurgy and machine building are laying off workers, and real wages have started to fall for the first time in a decade.\n\nThe Norwegian government pension fund suffered an investment loss of $92 billion during 2008. However, the overall value of the fund rose due to oil sales and currency movements.\n\nWith economic growth ceasing by the end in 2008, the Croatian economy entered a crisis that exposed numerous structural issues and unsustainable growth mechanisms, causing the period of instability to fester until as late as 2015.\n\nThe country was still in the midst of what was effectively a six-year long recession when it became a member of the European Union in July 2013.\n\nThe recession had contributed to the fall of the Cabinet of Ivo Sanader II and its replacement with the Cabinet of Jadranka Kosor. It was interrupted by a period of stagnation in 2011, that nevertheless led to the election of the Cabinet of Zoran Milanović, yet the economy soon returned to recession, in which it remained until the end of 2014.\n\nIn November 2008, the European Commission presented the European Economic Recovery Plan, a plan of 200 billion euros (1.2% of GDP) to fight against the consequences of the economic crisis in the European Union. In reality, the plan is a series of national measures to be implemented by each government, without much coherency between the policies. The measures included incentives to investment, tax cuts and social measures.\n\nElectrification of transport (electromobility) figures prominently in the Green Car Initiative (GCI), included in the European Economic Recovery Plan. DG TREN is supporting a large European \"electromobility\" project on electric vehicles and related infrastructure with a total budget of around €50million as part of the Green Car Initiative.\n\n\n"}

Certain aspects of the games are so well known as to have become emblematic of Scotland, such as the bagpipes, the kilt, and the heavy events, especially the caber toss. While centred on competitions in piping and drumming, dancing, and Scottish heavy athletics, the games also include entertainment and exhibits related to other aspects of Scottish and Gaelic culture.\n\nThe Cowal Highland Gathering, better known as the \"Cowal Games\", held in Dunoon, Scotland, every August, is the largest Highland games in the world, attracting around 3,500 competitors and somewhere in the region of 23,000 spectators from around the globe. Worldwide, however, it is exceeded in terms of spectators by two gatherings in the United States: the estimated 30,000 that attend Grandfather Mountain in North Carolina and the even larger gathering—the largest in the Northern Hemisphere—that has taken place every year since 1866. This event is currently held on Labor Day weekend in Pleasanton, California, and their Sesquicentennial Games held on September 5–6, 2015, attracted record crowds close to 50,000.\n\nThe games are claimed to have influenced Baron Pierre de Coubertin when he was planning the revival of the Olympic Games. De Coubertin saw a display of Highland games at the Paris Exhibition of 1889.\n\nThe origin of human games and sports predates recorded history. An example of a possible early games venue is at Fetteresso, although that location is technically a few miles south of the Scotland Highlands.\n\nIt is reported in numerous Highland games programs, that King Malcolm III of Scotland, in the 11th century, summoned contestants to a foot race to the summit of Craig Choinnich (overlooking Braemar). King Malcolm created this foot race in order to find the fastest runner in the land to be his royal messenger. Some have seen this apocryphal event to be the origin of today's modern Highland games.\n\nThere is a document from 1703 summoning the clan of the Laird of Grant, Clan Grant. They were to arrive wearing Highland coats and \"also with gun, sword, pistol and dirk\". From this letter, it is believed that the competitions would have included feats of arms.\n\nHowever, the modern Highland games are largely a Victorian invention, developed after the Highland Clearances.\n\nIn their original form many centuries ago, Highland games revolved around athletic and sports competitions. Though other activities were always a part of the festivities, many today still consider Highland athletics to be what the games are all about—in short, that the athletics are the Games, and all the other activities are just entertainment. Regardless, it remains true today that the athletic competitions are at least an integral part of the events and one—the caber toss—has come to almost symbolize the Highland games.\n\nAlthough quite a range of events can be a part of the Highland athletics competition, a few have become standard.\n\n\nMany of the Heavy Events competitors in Scottish highland athletics are former high school and college track and field athletes who find the Scottish games are a good way to continue their competitive careers.\n\nIncreasingly in the USA, the Heavy Events are attracting women and master class athletes which has led to a proliferation of additional classes in Heavy Events competitions. Lighter implements are used in the classes.\n\nFor many Highland games festival attendees, the most memorable of all the events at the games is the massing of the pipe bands. Normally held in conjunction with the opening and closing ceremonies of the games, as many as 20 or more pipe bands will march and play together. The result is a thunderous rendition of \"Scotland the Brave\" or \"Amazing Grace\", and other crowd-pleasing favourites.\n\nIt is, in fact, the music of the bagpipe which has come to symbolize music at the Games and, indeed, in Scotland itself. In addition to the massed bands, nearly all Highland games gatherings feature a wide range of piping and drumming competition, including solo piping and drumming, small group ensembles and, of course, the pipe bands themselves.\n\nMusic at Highland games gatherings also includes other forms, such as fiddling, harp circles and Celtic bands, usually spiced with a large amount of bagpipe music.\n\nThe Cowal Highland Gathering hosts the annual World Highland Dancing Championship. This event gathers the best competitive dancers from around the world who compete for the SOBHD sanctioned World Championship title.\n\nAt modern-day Highland Games events, a wide variety of other activities and events are generally available. Foremost among these are the clan tents and vendors of Scottish related goods. The various clan societies make the Highland games one of the main focus of their seasonal activities, usually making an appearance at as many such events as possible. Visitors can find out information about the Scottish roots and can become active in their own clan society if they wish.\n\nAt modern games, armouries will display their collections of swords and armour, and often perform mock battles. Various vendors selling Scottish memorabilia are also present selling everything from Irn-Bru to the stuffed likeness of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nHerding dog trials and exhibitions are often held, showcasing the breeder's and trainer's skills. In addition, there may be other types of Highland animals present, such as the Highland cattle.\n\nVarious traditional and modern Celtic arts are often showcased. These could include harpers' circles, Scottish country dancing, and one or more entertainment stages. In addition, most events usually feature a pre-event ceilidh (a type of social event with traditional music, dancing, song, and other forms of entertainment).\n\nVarious food vendors will also offer assorted types of traditional Scottish refreshment and sustenance.\n\nOn 1 August 1997 Canada Post issued 'Highland Games' designed by Fraser Ross, based on photographs by Andrew Balfour. The 45¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 x 13 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "22533312", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22533312", "title": "Horace (play)", "text": "Horace (play)\n\nHorace is a play by the French dramatist Pierre Corneille, drawing on Livy's account of the battle between the Horatii and the Curiatii. Written in reply to critics of his \"Le Cid\", it was dedicated to cardinal Richelieu and proved the author's second major success on its premiere in March 1640. Its protagonist Horatius is more daring than Rodrigue in \"Le Cid\", in that he sacrifices his best friend and kills his sister Camilla. It was the basis for the libretti for the operas \"Les Horaces\" and \"Gli Orazi e i Curiazi\".\n\nThe play, which begins in Rome, starts out in an atmosphere of peace and happiness. The Roman Horatii family is united to the Alban Curatii family. The young Horace is married to Sabine, a young Alban woman whose brother, Curiace, is engaged to Camille, the sister of Horace.\n\nBut the fratricidal war which breaks out between the two cities destroys this harmony. To finish it, each city designates three champions to fight in single combat to determine who will win. Contrary to expectations, fate chooses the three Horatii brothers for Rome and the three Curiatii brothers for Alba Longa. Horace, astonished, did not expect such a great honor. The friends once again find themselves face to face, with their consciences resolved for different reasons. While Horace is motivated by his patriotic duty, Curiace laments his cruel fate.\n\nThe people are likewise moved to see these six young men, nevertheless closely knit, fighting for the good of their country. However, their fate has been decided. During combat, two Horatii are quickly killed, and the last, the hero of the play, must then confront the three injured Curiatii alone. Filled with cunning and bravery, he first pretends to flee to avoid facing them all together. Then, when he attacks, he kills them one by one and thus achieves victory.\n\nAfter having received the congratulations of all of Rome, Horace kills his sister, who blames him for the murder of her beloved. The trial which follows includes a scene of a rousing plea from the father Horatius, who defends honor (a value very dear to Corneille), and thus Horace, against the romanticism represented by Camille. Horace is acquitted despite the indictment of Valère, a Roman gentleman who was also in love with Camille, much like Curiace.\n\nThis play was criticized at the time of its creation for its failure to conform to notions of a tragic hero: by killing Camille, Horace had lost the necessary innocence. Corneille rejected the notion of changing the death and so the Academy's formulated doctrine, and so helped prevent neo-Classicism from stifling theater.\n\n"}
{"id": "13656585", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13656585", "title": "Interest Fair", "text": "Interest Fair\n\nAn interest fair is an event somewhat like a science fair usually organized by a school that involves a group of corrugated cardboard boards on which students put information on their favorite topic or hobby Originally they also had to write a short paper. Unlike a science fair, it has both competitive and non-competitive elements.\n\nThe interest fair originated in Columbus, Ohio at St. Joseph Montessori school. It was created as an alternative to the science fair because they wanted more flexibility. They wanted to focus on the student. When they did it they invited 6- to 14-year-old students to do an interest fair, but required the older students to do it. The students were judged and had to tell visitors about their Interest Fair board.\n\nOver time the idea caught on, and it has evolved between schools, so it has been seen in many variations. In some schools the competitive element is completely removed, so there are no judges. In others, only the upper grade levels get to participate. In some places the students do not have to discuss their topic with visitors. Sometimes the students have to write a paper. The project may be optional or required. The rubric is almost always used.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35545035", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35545035", "title": "Kickback (bribery)", "text": "Kickback (bribery)\n\nA kickback is a form of negotiated bribery in which a commission is paid to the bribe-taker in exchange for services rendered. Generally speaking, the remuneration (money, goods, or services handed over) is negotiated ahead of time. The kickback varies from other kinds of bribes in that there is implied collusion between agents of the two parties, rather than one party extorting the bribe from the other. The purpose of the kickback is usually to encourage the other party to cooperate in the illegal scheme.\n\nThe term \"kickback\" comes from colloquial English language, and describes the way a recipient of illegal gain \"kicks back\" a portion of it to another person for that person's assistance in obtaining it.\n\nThe most common form of kickback involves a vendor submitting a fraudulent or inflated invoice (often for goods or services which were not needed, of inferior quality, or both), with an employee of the victim company assisting in securing payment. For his or her assistance in securing payment, the individual receives some sort of payment (cash, goods, services) or favor (the hiring of a relative, employment, etc.).\n\n\"Kickback brokers\" are individuals who may not receive the kickback personally, but who help link the individual or company providing the goods or services with individuals capable of assisting with the illegal payments. For helping to link the two colluding parties, either or both parties may make a payment to this \"broker\".\n\nKickbacks are one of the most common forms of government corruption. In some cases, the kickback takes the form of a \"cut of the action,\" and can be so well known as to be common knowledge—and even become part of a nation's culture. For example, in Indonesia, President Suharto was publicly known as \"Mr. Twenty-Five Percent\" because he required that all major contracts throughout the nation provide him with 25 percent of the income before he would approve the contract. And, in Pakistan, President Asif Ali Zardari was publicly known as \"Mr. Ten Percent\" for the same reason, which later became hundred percent. After coming into the government, he started taking 10% of all major contract investments before he would approve the contract. However, kickbacks differ from other forms of corruption, such as diversion of assets, as in embezzlement, because of the collusion between two parties.\n\nKickback schemes can be pervasive. For example, in the United States, companies providing medical services to Medicare patients were paying doctors to send patients to them, whether the patient needed the treatment, diagnosis, or test or not. In 1987, the United States Congress passed the stringent Anti-Kickback Act to prevent such schemes.\n\nIn Italy, the political scene was realigned dramatically by the \"Tangentopoli\" scandals in the 1990s, which uncovered widespread use of kickbacks in the national and local governments.\n\n"}
{"id": "43740594", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43740594", "title": "Madeline (1998 film)", "text": "Madeline (1998 film)\n\nMadeline is a 1998 live-action family dramedy film adaptation of the children's book series and television series Madeline. The film starred newcomer Hatty Jones as the titular character with the better known Frances McDormand and Nigel Hawthorne in supporting roles as Miss Clavel and Lord Covington. The film encompasses the plots of four \"Madeline\" books. It was released on July 10, 1998 by TriStar Pictures.\n\nIn 1956 Paris, France, a young girl named Madeline attends a Catholic boarding school, taught by the strict but loving nun Miss Clavel and fed by the passionate French chef Hélène. Madeline is an orphan, coming from neither family nor money, but maintains a positive attitude and is best friends with another girl, Aggie.\n\nEarly in the film, Madeline is stricken with appendicitis and taken to the hospital, where Madeline undergoes an emergency appendectomy. During her stay there, Madeline meets Lady Covington, the terminally ill wife of the school's board of trustee's member, Lord Covington. Unlike her husband, Lady Covington is a kind-hearted person who cares deeply for the school and the girls, having attended the school herself in her youth. Lady Covington asks a favor of Madeline; she carved her birth name, Marie Gilbert, into one of the dorm's bed frames and she would like for Madeline to find out if her name is still there. Unfortunately, a few days later, when Madeline is ready to leave the hospital, she learns from Miss Clavel that Lady Covington has passed away. But, true to her promise, Madeline searches for her name under the beds, finding it under her own.\n\nAfter her hospital stay, Madeline finds that the Spanish ambassador has purchased the property next door to the school and that he also has a son, Pepito, who is around Madeline's age. While the other girls are smitten with Pepito, Madeline is far from impressed and irritated by the noise created by the boy riding around on his Vespa. Shortly after the ambassador's arrival, Lord Covington announces he plans on closing the school due to the death of his wife.\n\nMiss Clavel, unnerved by Pepito's bothering her girls, attempts to make peace with the boy by giving his tutor, Leopold, a tool box for him, in hopes that it will distract him and help put an end to his obnoxious ways. However, her actions are less than successful as Pepito takes it upon himself to steal Madeline's drawing pad and write \"Beware\" with a vicious drawing in it before inviting the girls to his birthday party. During the party, Pepito tries to unnerve his guests by showing them a mouse but is unsuccessful in unnerving Madeline. Undeterred, Pepito threatens to kill the mouse, either by feeding him to his snake or executing him using a guillotine he made using the tool box he'd received as a gift from Miss Clavel. Madeline, angered by Pepito's threats to harm the tiny animal, brutally attacks him and releases all of his mice, causing guests to flee in horror and Miss Clavel to faint, which results in the girls' visit getting cut short, much to Pepito's delight. On the way back to the school, Madeline takes Pepito's keys in an act of revenge, preventing him from riding his noisy scooter around the grounds.\n\nWhile out on a daily walk, Madeline accidentally falls into the Seine while standing on the ledge of a bridge going over the river and is whisked away by the current. She is rescued by a stray dog, whom she names Genevieve, and emerges from the ordeal relatively unscathed, save for a cold. While sick in bed, Madeline is displeased to watch Leopold teach Pepito, frustrated over the loss of his keys, how to start his scooter with a paper clip. However, her anger disperses when she discovers that Genevieve has followed her to the school and convinces Miss Clavel who has dog allergies to let her golden haired savior live in the shed. Wanting to save the school Madeline forms an alliance with Pepito, enlisting his help to sabotage Lord Covington's attempts to sell the property but her efforts are ultimately discovered by Lord Covington, who initially blames Miss Clavel. Madeline takes responsibility for her involvement, though Lord Covington is unmoved by her apology or the motivation behind her actions when she makes a Freudian slip and calls him \"Cucuface\" and, after leaving, he sets Genevieve loose into the night in an act of retaliation against her and the girls.\n\nUpset over the loss of Genevieve, Miss Clavel takes the girls to a local circus in hopes of cheering them up and Madeline, fearing she'll have no place to go as an orphan once the school closes, makes the decision to join the circus, hoping to make friends and find a home within the community there. After telling Aggie of her plans and making her swear not to tell, Madeline leaves the group and unintentionally stumbles upon Leopold, with the help of a trio of clowns known as \"The Idiots,\" kidnapping Pepito, hoping to hold him from ransom, and, due to her discovery, is abducted as well. Luckily, Leopold and the Idiots leave the two children alone with a motorcycle, which Madeline uses her hair clip to start and convinces Pepito to drive, though he is initially reluctant as he's never driven one, only a Vespa. The two are pursued by Leopold and the Idiots but Miss Clavel, having learned of Madeline's running away from Aggie, goes driving in search of her and, narrowly avoiding a collision with the two children on the bike, is able to cause the Idiots to crash into a lake. The police arrive and arrest the kidnappers.\n\nBack at the school, Lord Covington appears and happily shares that he's sold the property to the ambassador of Uzbekistan. Madeline realises that Lord Covington is merely trying to sell the school due to his grief over his wife. He at first dismisses her sympathy but Madeleine speaks earnestly to Lord Covington about her own family being gone and says that Lady Covington is still with him and with the school and Miss Clavel, knowing Madeline is fearful of having no one if the school were to shut down, assures her that they'll be together, regardless of what happens. While Lord Covington is moved by Madeline's words and sincerity, he regretfully tells her and the girls that there's nothing he can do as he's already sold the property but, in a happy twist, the ambassador, also moved by Madeline, decides to back out of the sale. Hélène decides to celebrate by fixing a vegetarian feast, to which Madeline responds and that she wants Chicken Hélène, with the girls squawking in agreement. The film then concludes with a montage, accompanied by \"What a Wonderful World\", and then changes back to a book setting, as the French word, \"fin\" (meaning \"the end\") appears.\n\nFilming took place in Paris, where the story is set, from September 1997 to January 1998, with English actress Hatty Jones, then 8 or 9 years, cast as the main character. Unlike the books, the film takes place in 1956, not 1939. Many of the landmarks from the books appear in the film, although some were too crowded with modern traffic to be used.\n\nThe film's costume department went for some artistic licence in developing the costumes for \"Madeline\". Aside from moving the time period from the 1930s to 1950, the producers elected for saturated blues and reds in the students' uniforms while keeping them as believable as possible, ruling out the possibility of using grey as it was seen as depressing. Similar considerations were made for Frances McDormand's character, a novice nun who, according to research, would have worn a short black habit; a softer blue habit similar to the one worn by Miss Clavel in the books was used instead.\n\nWhile largely based on the original series, with storylines from three of the picture books weaved into the plot, several liberties were taken with the characters' backstories. Notably, Madeline is depicted as an orphan in the film, while in the books, she receives a dollhouse from her father and is known not only to have both her parents but siblings as well.\n\n\"Madeline \"was released on VHS, part of the Columbia TriStar Family Collection series, and DVD on December 15, 1998.\n\n\nThis film received mixed to positive reviews upon release; it now has 62% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 29 reviews. On their TV show, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert awarded the film with \"Two Thumbs Up\" (see photo of film). Nell Minow of Common Sense Media said that the movie was \"great for young kids and fans of the books.\" AOL movie critic Brandon Judell said of it, \"No horribly arch double entendres to draw in audiences who can't spend two hours in a theater without having their libido massaged.\" Jeffery Huston called it \"a disarming, charming fable so artfully crafted that adults will fall under its spell.\" Conversely, John R. McEwen gave a negative review, stating that the movie was: \"...Adequately simple for children, though perhaps a bit pedestrian for adults.\" A similarly negative review was given by Michael O'Sullivan of \"The Washington Post\", stating that \"their 8-year-old daughters will less likely be impressed by the meandering story, dull visuals and flat characterizations.\"\n\nFor reasons not entirely clear, the movie has a lot of significant discrepancies from both the books and TV series as follows:\n\n"}

It produces about 15 plays and musicals annually in summer and winter seasons. Plays are performed in three separate theatres in the complex, which is collectively called the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts:\nThe Old Globe Theatre and the Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre are part of the Conrad Prebys Theatre Center. The White Theatre also houses the Karen and Donald Cohn Education Center.\n\nThe Old Globe Theatre was built in 1935, designed by Richard Requa as part of the California Pacific International Exposition. The theatre was based on a copy of one built for the Chicago Century of Progress, which in turn was a copy of the Globe Theatre in London, England, where many of William Shakespeare's plays were performed during his lifetime. Like the original Globe, the theatre was open in the center with a roof over the seating on the sides.\n\nDuring the exposition, it hosted 50-minute versions of Shakespeare plays. At the end of the exposition, the Globe had been received so well that a nonprofit organization called the San Diego Community Theatre was formed to save the temporary structure from demolition. The committee leased the structure from the city, produced full-length plays, and created a more permanent structure by roofing over the theatre and bringing it up to code.\n\nIn 1939, a young actor and director named Craig Noel was hired as general director. During World War II the U.S. Navy took over all buildings in Balboa Park, including the Globe. The Community Theatre group stayed together, producing one-act plays in various venues around San Diego. When the Globe was returned to civilian use in 1947, Noel returned as general director, and he remained in a leadership position until his death in 2010. In 1949 he launched the Globe's summer Shakespeare Festival in partnership with the drama department at University of San Diego. Since then the Shakespeare festival has been presented every summer except 1953, when Noel broke with tradition by producing the smash hit play \"Mister Roberts\" instead. The Globe continued to produce a combination of modern plays along with Shakespeare and other classics. In 1981 Jack O'Brien was hired as artistic director, while Noel became executive producer.\n\nThe Cassius Carter Centre Stage, a theater in the round, was added in 1969 in what had been the Falstaff Tavern restaurant. It was rebuilt in 2009 as the Sheryl and Harvey White Theatre.\n\nIn March 1978, the Globe Theatre was destroyed in an arson fire, and an outdoor festival stage was hastily constructed so that the 1978 season could still be produced. The Globe Theatre was rebuilt and reopened in 1981. In 1984, the festival stage in turn succumbed to arson. It was rebuilt and is now named the Lowell Davies Festival Theatre. The entire three-theatre complex is called the Simon Edison Centre for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe Globe has grown into an internationally known theatre complex, an \"influential powerhouse among regional theatres.\" In 1984 it received the Tony Award for best regional theatre. Shows which originated at the Old Globe have gone on to Broadway to win nine Tony Awards and nearly 60 nominations.\n\n\n"}

Although several binary blackhole candidates have been identified, they have yet to be verified by long-term observations. In order to ascertain that an object is a BBH, periodical luminosity change in X-ray wavelength must be detected. However, continuous observation of BBHs by large X-ray telescopes is difficult as such spacecraft are used by many groups and have numerous observation targets. Since microsatellites have comparatively low-cost, flexibility, and can fly more often than large spacecrafts, they can conduct unique studies where risks are associated. As ORBIS is dedicated to study BBHs, it can conduct continuous observation of such bodies. The scientific goals of the microsatellite is to uncover the growth process of black holes and galaxies, and to and contribute to gravitational-wave astronomy.\n\nSome simulations have concluded that after crossing a certain distance, the energy dissipation of two approaching black holes ceases, result in them not getting closer any further. However, the merger of black holes is expected to occur during the collision of galaxies. This unsolved problem is known as the final parsec problem. By finding and studying black holes less than 1 pc apart, ORBIS aims to resolve this issue.\n"}

Supporters contend that the hand is from a Yeti, a scientifically unrecognized animal purported to live in the Himalayan mountains. A finger bone from the hand was tested and the DNA shown to be human.\n\nOil businessman and adventurer Tom Slick first heard accounts of the possible existence of a \"Yeti hand\" held as a ritual artifact in the monastery at Pangboche during one of his first \"Abominable Snowman\" treks in 1957. The Slick expeditions were the first to bring photographs of the hand back to the West.\n\nDuring later Tom Slick-sponsored expeditions in and around the Himalayas, his associates gathered more information on the \"Pangboche hand,\" and an effort to further examine it was planned. In 1959 Peter Byrne, a member of Slick's expedition that year, reportedly stole pieces of the artifact after the monks who owned it refused to allow its removal for study. Byrne claimed to have replaced the stolen bone fragments with human bones, rewrapping the hand to disguise his theft.\n\nByrne smuggled the bones from Nepal into India, after which actor James Stewart allegedly smuggled the hand out of the country in his luggage. Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman rediscovered this story while writing Tom Slick's biography in the 1980s. Coleman confirmed details of the incidents with written materials in the Slick archives, interviews with Byrne, and correspondence with Stewart. Byrne later confirmed the Pangboche hand story via a letter from Stewart that Byrne published in a general book on Nepalese wildlife.\n\nDuring the highly publicized 1960 World Book expedition, which had many goals including gathering intelligence on Chinese rocket launchings, Sir Edmund Hillary and Marlin Perkins took a sidetrip in Nepal to investigate the hand. Hillary was unaware of the possibility that he was looking at a combination of the original material and the human bones placed there by Byrne. Hillary determined the artifact was a hoax.\n\nAccording to monks at Pangboche monastery, many years ago, a monk walked into a cave to meditate. There, he saw a Yeti. Many years later, he came back, and the yeti was dead. He collected the hand and scalp and took it back to the monastery where it remained until it was discovered in the modern age.\n\nLondon University primatologist William Charles Osman Hill conducted a physical examination of the pieces that Byrne supplied. His first findings were that it was hominid, and later in 1960 he decided that the Pangboche fragments were a closer match with a Neanderthal.\n\nIn 1991, in conjunction with Coleman's research, it was discovered that the Slick expedition consultant, an American anthropologist by the name of George Agogino, had retained samples of the alleged Yeti hand. The NBC program \"Unsolved Mysteries\" obtained samples and determined they were similar to human tissue, but were not human, and could only verify they were \"near human.\" After the broadcast of the program, the entire hand was stolen from the Pangboche monastery, and reportedly disappeared into a private collection via the illegal underground in the sale of antiquities. George Agogino, before his death on September 11, 2000, transferred his important files on the Pangboche Yeti hand to Loren Coleman.\n\nIn 2010 Weta Workshops produced a replica skull and hand based on photos of the missing hand and skull. Mike Allsop handed over the replica skull and hand to monks at Pangboche in May 2011.\n\nOn 27 December 2011 it was announced that a finger belonging to the hand contained human DNA, following tests carried out in Edinburgh. Dr. Rob Ogden commented that \"We have got a very, very strong match to a number of existing reference sequences on human DNA databases... Human was what we were expecting and human is what we got.\"\n\n"}
{"id": "11188235", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11188235", "title": "Pavithrotsavam", "text": "Pavithrotsavam\n\nPavitrotsavam is an annual ritual in the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, Andhra Pradesh. Pavitrotsava is derived from the combination of two words \"Pavitra\" (holy) and \"utsava\" (festival). This utsava is penitential as well as propitiatory and its main objective is to get rid of the evil that might have been caused due to omissions and commissions in the performance of various rituals throughout the year. The festival is also known as \"Dosha Nivaarana\" (error correction),\"Sarva Yajna Phalapradha\" (The One ritual that equals the holiness of rites all year long),\"Sarva Doshopasamana\" (Removal of all errors), \"Sarva Tushtikara\", \"Sarvakaamapradha\", \"Sarvalokasantida\".\n\nThe Jayakhya Samhita explains that pavitra protects one from evil. The puranas prescribe \"Pavitra Aaropana\" (adorning the deity with \"pavitra\" - sanctified garlands of thread), as an integral part of the rituals during the worship of Lord Vishnu. The \"Agni Purana\" specifies that the first day of a lunar fortnight either in the beginning of the month of Aashada or the end of the Krithika should be chosen for performing pavitrotsava. The \"Garuda Purana\" says that this rite should be done on the 12th day of the dark or bright fortnight.\n\nIn Tirumala, the Pavitrotsavam ritual is conducted on \"Sravana shuddha dashami\" day.\n\n`Ankurarpanam' or the sowing of nine type of holy seeds in earthen containers is undertaken on the day preceding the festival. This ritual signifies the beginning of festival in the temple. This is followed by recital of vedas in a ritual called \"Mritsangrahana\". The Ankurarpana and Mritsangrahana rituals are identical to those performed during Brahmotsava. Veda recitation is started after the Mritsangrahana ritual and this recitation of the Vedas concludes on the third day. Through the chanting of the vedas, \"Aavahana\" (Invoking) is done for Lord Vishnu in the Pradhana Kumbha (first of the holy container). There are 16 other Kumbhas surrounding this Pradhana Kumbha and it is believed that the various mantras which are recited infuse voice vibrations that have great religious and spiritual force. The \"Pradhana khumba\" is taken to the main deity on the concluding day and the augmented spiritual power is believed to be transmitted to the Moola Vigraha (Kumbha Aavaahanam). The rituals on the three days include \"Thirumanjanam\" and \"Homam\" (prayer to sacrificial fire) to the main deity as well as primary idols of Lord Venkateswara.\n\n\"Pavitra\"s, the garlands made from special thread are taken in a procession and used to decorate Lord Malayappa swami and his consorts on the second day. In the evening of the second day, the idols are taken on a procession around the four mada streets.\n\nDuring the three-day festival, Arjitha Sevas like \"Kalyanotsavam\", \"Arjitha Brahmotsavam\", \"Arjitha Vasanothsavam\", \"Sahasara Deepalankarana Seva\", \"Dolotsavam\" are cancelled while the morning rituals are held.\n\nThe origin of Pavitrotsavam in Tirumala dates back to 1463 A.D. The stone inscription found on the northern wall of the Vagapadi verandah in the first \"Prakaara\" of the Tirumala temple gives a very detailed account. The festival was instituted by Saluva Malliah deva Raja during the time of Saluva Narasimha. The inscription refers even to the items of expenditure to be incurred in connection with the celebration of \"Pavitra Tirunal\".\n\nThe festival is believed to have been conducted till 1562 A.D. after which the ritual was stopped. The reason for discontinuing such an important festival is not recorded and remains unknown. TTD decided to revive the ritual that is followed in all Vishnu temples and the festival has been on the annual calendar from 1962 onwards.\n\nPavitrotsavam is an \"Arjita Seva\" - participation by payment to the Lord. TTD sells tickets to this service on the second and third days. Each ticket allows two persons and the primary ticket holder is given 10 dosas and Pongal on the second day and 10 dosas and Pongal, 6 vadas and \"vastram\" (one silk angavastram and one cotton blouse) on the third day.\n"}

It has also been found that Wikipedia articles were targeted by Vietnamese communist internet propaganda activities.\n\nIt is unclear how the brigades started since the Communist Party of Vietnam (CPVN) often controls political information. However, the earliest form of Internet propaganda supporting CPVN seems to have begun in 2007, when the Government announced to \"eliminate any wrong news that threaten the Party's rule\". As the Communist Party is the only party allowed by Vietnamese constitution, it was the beginning of the brigades.\nIn 2017, Lieutenant-General Nguyen Trong Nghia, deputy head of the Vietnamese military’s political department, confirmed that Vietnam has a new, 10,000-strong military cyber warfare unit to counter criticisms of the government on the Internet.The cyber unit named Force 47 is active in several sectors.\n\nThe methods used are not always clear, but includes criticism of opposing views to those of the Communist Party. Vietnamese nationalists, dissidents and anti-communists claim that the CPVN has been doing this for a long time, to brainwash people's minds and distort and truth, branding who disagree with the Communist Party as \"traitors of the nation\".\n\nBBC and Deutsche Welle correspondents have also reported about the brigades' activities. Other Governments also accused Vietnamese Communist Party's troll army for attacking and hacking websites that criticize the CPVN.\n\nThere are claims that the CPVN has attempted to rewrite history, including war crimes by North Vietnam during Vietnam War having been completely erased to serve the Party's agenda, promoting only themselves as the \"heros\" of Vietnam.\n\n"}

The rebellion was a reaction to the imposition of Nicaean rule in the person of governor Constantine Chabaron. The rebels were active in Durrë, Ohrid, Debar and Mat. The Nicaean forces were under the command of George Akropolites, who described the events himself in his history. \n\nIn the autumn of 1257, Akropolites left Thessaloniki and by way of Kastoria entered Kounavia, Mat and Debar in an effort to convince the local chieftains to abandon the Despot of Epirus, Michael II, and submit to imperial rule. Yet, in February 1258 the Nicaean garrisons were annihilated. Taking advantage of the situation, Michael II started his campaign against the Nicaeans and captured Chabaron in Kanina. The Albanians drove back the imperial troops sent as reinforcements and Akropolites set fresh troops in the move, opening his way to Ohrid and Prespa, but without having a chance to engage the rebels in the inner regions. He was forced to return to Prilep and fell captive to Michael II. The revolt was suppressed after troops from Asia Minor were sent in the spring of 1259, headed by John Komnenos.

The members of the council consisted of the President of the Soviet Union, and highest officials (which typically was presidents of their republics) from the Soviet Union Republics. During the period of transition it was the highest organ of state power, having the power to elect a premier, or a person who would take Gorbachev's place if absent; the office of Vice President of the Soviet Union had been abolished following the failed August Coup that very same year.\n\nWith the central government's authority greatly weakened by the failed coup, Gorbachev established a four-man committee, led by Russian SFSR Premier Ivan Silayev, that included Grigory Yavlinsky, Arkadi Volsky, and Yuri Luzhkov, to elect a new Cabinet of Ministers. This committee was later transformed into the Committee on the Operational Management of the Soviet Economy (COMSE), also chaired by Silayev, to manage the Soviet economy. COMSE was quickly surpassed in authority by the Interstate Economic Committee of the Soviet Union (IEC), also officially known as the \"Economic Community\", which was established on 20 September under the name Inter-Republican Economic Committee. Its function was to coordinate economic policy across the Soviet Union. As Chairman of both COMSE and the IEC, Silayev presided over a quickly disintegrating Soviet Union. On 6 September 1991 a presidential decree temporarily gave the IEC the same authority as the Cabinet of Ministers, and Silayev became the Soviet Union's \"de facto\" Premier.\n\nWhen he first took office, Silayev wanted to reduce the powers of the central government and give more powers to the Soviet Republics. This view changed; he demanded that Yeltsin give back much of the authority of the central government which he had usurped following the August Coup. In this he failed, and his position as Russian SFSR Premier was severely weakened as a result. Oleg Lobov, Silayev's First Deputy Premier, led the anti-Silayev faction in the Russian SFSR Council of Ministers and managed to oust him on 26 September 1991; Lobov succeeded Silayev as acting Premier of the Russian SFSR. Silayev, as overseer of the economy, was given the task of initiating economic reforms in the Soviet Union in a way that suited both the central government and the Soviet republics. Silayev tried to maintain an integrated economy while initiating the marketisation of the economy.

Methodist custom holds that apart from depictions of the Stations of the Cross, other images (such as the altar cross) continue the Lenten habitude of being veiled. \n\nIn addition to the stripping of the altar at the conclusion of the Maundy Thursday liturgy in Lutheran Churches, the \"lectern and pulpit are [also] left bare until Easter to symbolize the humiliation and barrenness of the cross.\"\n\nIn Anglican Churches, this ceremony is also performed at the conclusion of Maundy Thursday services, \"in which all appointments, linens, and paraments are removed from the altar and chancel in preparation for Good Friday.\"\n\nIn the earlier form of the Roman Rite, the stripping of the altar was done at the end of Mass of the Lord's Supper on Maundy Thursday. It is still carried out All altars in the church, except for the altar of repose, are stripped. In the present form of the Roman Rite, as revised in 1955, there is no ceremony of stripping the altar. At a suitable time after the Mass the altar is stripped, usually by the sacristan, and crosses are removed from the church, if possible. There is no Mass on Good Friday or Holy Saturday, the next one being that of the Easter Vigil. On Good Friday, a white cloth is placed on the altar for the last part of the Celebration of the Passion of the Lord, after the conclusion of which the altar is stripped, again privately, except that the cross remains on the altar with two or four candlesticks.\n\nThe form of the Roman Rite in use immediately before the reform of the Easter Triduum ceremonies by Pope Pius XII in 1955 had a formal ceremony of stripping the altar as a conclusion of the Holy Thursday Mass, which was then celebrated in the morning. After removing the ciborium from the high altar to the altar of repose, the priest, accompanied by the other ministers, went to the sacristy, where he took off his white Mass vestments and donned a violet stole. Then, with the other ministers, he removed the altarcloths, vases of flowers, antependium and all other ornaments then customarily placed on the altar. Unlike present usage, the altar cross and candlesticks were left on the altar. This was done to the accompaniment of Psalm 21 (Vulgate) (\"Deus, Deus meus\") preceded and followed by the antiphon \"Diviserunt sibi vestimenta mea: et super vestem meam miserunt sortem\" (\"They divided my clothes among them and cast lots for my garment\").\n\nIn earlier centuries, the altars were in some churches washed with a bunch of hyssop dipped in wine and water. Augustine Joseph Schulte says that this was done \"to render them in some manner worthy of the Lamb without stain who is immolated on them, and to recall to the minds of the faithful with how great purity they should assist at the Holy Sacrifice and receive Holy Communion.\" He adds that the ceremony was intended as homage offered to Jesus in return for his humbly washing the feet of his disciples, the ceremonial commemoration of which was, before 1955, carried out separately from the Mass and stripping of the altar.\n\nEamonn Duffy alludes to this ceremony in his book \"The Stripping of the Altars: Traditional Religion in England, 1400–1580\", a history of popular religion in pre-Reformation England.\n"}

Her works include the memoir \"Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou\" (\"A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife\"; 1997) based on her experience of marrying an Afghan and her time in Afghanistan during Taliban rule. The story was used as the basis for the Bollywood film \"Escape from Taliban\".\n\nAt the age of 49, she was killed by suspected Taliban militants during the evening of 4 September or in the early morning hours of 5 September 2013, outside her home in Paktika Province, Afghanistan.\n\nSushmita Banerjee was born in Calcutta West Bengal (present-day Kolkata, India) to a middle-class Bengali Brahmin family. Her father worked in the civil defence department and her mother, a homemaker. She was the only sister to her three brothers. She first met her future husband Janbaz Khan, an Afghan businessman, at a theatre rehearsal in Calcutta. She married him on 2 July 1988. The marriage took place secretly in Kolkata, as she feared her parents would object to the inter-religious marriage. When her parents tried to get them divorced, she fled to Afghanistan with Khan. She discovered that her husband already had a first wife, Gulguti, when she found them in bed together. Although shocked, she continued to live in Khan's ancestral house in Patiya village, with her three brothers-in-law, their wives, and with Gulguti and Gulguti's children. Later, Khan returned to Kolkata to continue his business, but Banerjee could not return. Sayeda, a trained nurse in gynaecology, opened a clinic to help the women of the village.\n\nWith the burgeoning Taliban power in Afghanistan, Banerjee witnessed fundamentalist changes occurring in the country. In a 2003 interview, she said that the plight of women in particular got worse. Women were banned from talking with men other than family members, they were not allowed outside home. Schools, colleges, and hospitals were shut down. Taliban men discovered her clinic and beat her severely in May 1995.\n\nBanerjee made two abortive attempts to flee Afghanistan. She was caught and kept in house arrest in the village. A fatwa was issued against her and she was scheduled to die on 22 July 1995. With the help of the village headman, she finally fled from the village, in the process killing three Taliban men with an AK-47 rifle. She reached Kabul, and took a flight back to Kolkata on 12 August 1995.\n\nShe lived in India until 2013, and published several books. After returning to Afghanistan, she worked as a health worker in Paktika Province in southeastern Afghanistan, and began filming the lives of local women.\n\nAccording to Afghan police, suspected Taliban terrorists forced entry into her house in Paktika on the night of 4 September 2013. They bound her husband and absconded with her. Her corpse was found early the next day beside a \"madrasa\" in the outskirts of the provincial capital Sharana. The body had 20 bullet hole marks. Police surmised she might have been targeted for murder for various reasons, including her book, her social work in the region, or merely the fact that she was an Indian woman, or according to others for not wearing a burqa, for which she was sentenced to death almost two decades earlier, under the Taliban regime. The Taliban denied involvement in this attack. Later a spokesman for renegade Taliban militia known as The Suicide Group of the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan announced it had killed Banerjee. The group, led by Mullah Najibullah, explained that they had kidnapped, interrogated and then murdered Banerjee because they believed she was \"an Indian spy\". Although some of her neighbours reflected that her death may have been partly caused by her not following local Afghan traditions, especially regarding the wearing of a burqa outside the home.\n\nSushmita Banerjee wrote \"Kabuliwalar Bangali Bou\" (\"A Kabuliwala's Bengali Wife\") in 1995. It recounted the tale of her love marriage to an Afghan businessman, Jaanbaz Khan, her moving to Afghanistan in 1989, the adversities she faced in Talibani Afghanistan, and her eventual escape back to Kolkata. In 2003, \"Escape from Taliban\", a Bollywood film, starring Manisha Koirala was made based on the book.\n\nShe authored \"Talibani Atyachar—Deshe o Bideshe\" (Taliban atrocities in Afghanistan and Abroad), \"Mullah Omar, Taliban O Ami\" (Mullah Omar, Taliban and I) (2000), \"Ek Borno Mithya Noi\" (\"Not a Word is a Lie\") (2001) and \"Sabhyatar Sesh Punyabani\" (The Swansong of Civilisation).\n\n"}

June originated from an area of convection that was first witnessed on August 15 in the Philippine Sea. Despite initial wind shear, the area intensified into a tropical storm three days later as it tracked westward. After tracking over Luzon, June entered the South China Sea on August 30. Despite remaining poorly organized, June re-intensified over land, and it was estimated to have briefly attained typhoon intensity before striking China, just to the east of Hong Kong, at maximum intensity, although its remnants were last noticed on September 3.\n\nAffecting the country four days before Typhoon Ike would devastate the Philippines, June brought widespread damage to the nation. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962 people sought shelter. A total of 671 homes were destroyed, with 6,341 others damaged. A total of 121 people were killed, while 17 other individuals were reportedly missing, and 26 other people were wounded. Damage totaled $24.2 million (1984 USD, including $15.24 million in agriculture and $8.82 million in infrastructure). Following June and Ike, several major countries provided cash and other goods. In all, $7.5 million worth of aid was donated to the nation in relief. In addition to effects on the Philippines, 1,500 homes were damaged and of farmland were flooded in the Guangdong province.\n\nTyphoon June, the final of seven tropical cyclones to develop in the Western Pacific basin in August 1984, formed from the monsoon trough. A large area of convection was first detected on satellite imagery, and at midday, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center determined that a closed area of low pressure developed between the 135th meridian east and the 140th meridian east. The associated thunderstorm activity initially failed to consolidate due to strong wind shear caused by a displaced anticyclone. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started to track the system 06:00 UTC on August 26. The next day, the wind shear began to relent, as an upper-level anticyclone became located over the system as the system tracked westward, although the circulation remained tough to identify by weather satellites. At 06:51 UTC on August 27, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported winds of . Based on the above data and an increase in the system's organization, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. On August 28, the storm's center of circulation became better defined, and at 06:00 UTC, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began to monitor the storm and assigned it with the local name \"Maring\".\n\nContinuing westward due to a subtropical ridge to its north, June slowly intensified. On the afternoon of August 28, June made landfall along the coast of Luzon as a strong tropical storm, with the JTWC and JMA estimating winds of and respectively. Over land, the low- and mid-level circulations began to decouple, with the mid-level center and most of the deep convection continuing west and the low-level center veering west-northwest and early on August 29, the surface center re-merged into open water, having weakened slightly according to both the JTWC and the JMA. June began to turn northwest in response to a trough over the East China Sea. At 18:00 UTC on August 29, the JMA classified June as a severe tropical storm. Six hours later, the JTWC reported that June attained its peak intensity of . Despite lacking in organization, a surface pressure of was measured in Basco as the cyclone passed near the area. The JMA declared June a typhoon at midday on August 30. At this time, it also estimated a peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . Five hours later, June made landfall east of Hong Kong while at peak intensity. The JMA continued to follow the system inland throughout September 3.\n\nTyphoon June hit the Philippines four days before Typhoon Ike would devastate the archipelago. The first storm to hit the Philippines in 1984, June brought rough seas from Luzon to Davao. Philippine Airlines suspended flights to eight cities and railway services to the northern portions of the island chain were also suspended. Power was knocked out for four days across much of the country due to both systems. Six people were killed in landslides that isolated the mountain resort city of Baguio, where five others were missing and seven were injured. According to the Philippine News Agency, a 22-year-old man picking seashells drowned after he was swept out to sea near Bacolod, on Negros Island. In San Fernando, located in the northern province of La Union, 200 houses were flattened and 120 people were injured. In Manila, heavy winds and rough seas left streets flooded, resulting in traffic jams. The storm caused serious damage to the nation's rice fields, the country's main export.\n\nFrom the two storms combined, more than 1 million were displaced from their homes. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962 people or 92,271 families sought shelter due to the typhoon, of which 5,023 families or 30,138 people sought shelter in schools, churches and town halls in a total of 10 provinces. A total of 671 homes were destroyed while 6,341 others were damaged. One hundred-twenty-one people were killed while 17 other individuals were reportedly missing and 26 other people were wounded. The storm inflicted $24.2 million in damage, with $15.2 million in agriculture and $8.82 million in infrastructure.\n\nPrior to its second landfall, in Hong Kong, a No 1. hurricane signal was issued after June entered the South China Sea. The storm brought heavy rains and strong winds to the region. A minimum pressure of was recorded at the Hong Kong Royal Observatory early on August 30. Tate's Cairn recorded a peak wind speed of and a peak wind gust of . Cheung Chau observed of rain over a five-day period. Although damage in Hong Kong was minimal, heavy rains in eastern Guangdong inundated of farmland, and damage to 1,500 dwellings.\n\nDue to effects from both Ike and June, President Ferdinand Marcos set aside $4 million for relief work but initially refused any international aid. He also traveled to Ilocos Norte to inspect damage. The Philippines Air Force delivered of food, medicine, and clothes. According to officials, 92 health teams backed by 17 army medical units were fielded; these teams distributed $1.66 million worth of medicine. The Philippine Red Cross disturbed food to 239,331 people, or 44,247 families. On September 8, the nation abandoned its policy of refusing foreign aid, citing a lack of resources in the country due to its poor economy, as well as, the mass destruction across the country from both systems. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs gave an emergency grant of $50,000. UNICEF provided $116,000 worth of vitamins and medicine and an additional $116,950 in cash, as well as of milk powder. Thy later provided vegetable seeds, died fish, and garden fertilizer. The World Health Organization provided $7,000 worth of aid. Furthermore, the United Nations Development Programme awarded the country $30,000 in cash. The European Economic Community provided of milk and $367,650 worth of cash. In the middle of September, the United States approved $1 million in aid to the archipelago. Japan also sent a $500,000 check. Australia awarded almost $500,000 worth of cash and food. New Zealand donated of skin milk. The Norwegian Red Cross provided $58,500 in aid while Belgium also provided three medical kits. The Swiss Red Cross awarded a little under $21,000 in cash. German provided slightly more than $50,000 in cash. France provided roughly $11,000 in donations to the nation's red cross. The Red Cross Society of China donated $20,000 in cash.
