His father was a skilled laborer who died shortly after he had returned from World War I. Before joining the army in 1937 Maresyev worked as a turner and then participated in the construction of Komsomolsk-on-Amur. In 1940 he graduated from Bataysk Military School of Aviation. He began his flights as a fighter pilot in August 1941. He had shot down four German aircraft by March 1942, but on 4 April 1942 his Polikarpov I-16 was shot down near Staraya Russa, almost certainly by future Knight's Cross holder and 48-kill experte \"Fw.\" Peter Siegler(3./JG-54) and was nearly captured by Nazi forces.\n\nDespite being badly injured, Alexey managed to return to the Soviet-controlled territory. During his 18-day-long journey his injuries deteriorated so badly that both of his legs had to be amputated below the knee. Desperate to return to his fighter pilot service, he subjected himself to nearly a year of exercise to master the control of his prosthetic devices, and succeeded at that, returning to flying in June 1943.\n\nDuring a dog fight in August 1943, he shot down three German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters. In total, he completed 86 combat flights and shot down 11 German warplanes. He was awarded the Golden Star of the Hero of the Soviet Union (24 August 1943), the highest military decoration of the USSR. In 1944, Maresyev joined the Communist Party and two years later retired from the army.\n\nIn 1952, Maresyev graduated from the Higher Party School. In 1956, he obtained a Ph.D. in History and started working in the Soviet War Veterans Committee. Eventually, he became a member of the Supreme Soviet.\n\nHe died of a heart attack on 19 May 2001, just an hour ahead of his official 85th birthday celebration.\n\nHis story served as a basis for the novel by Boris Polevoy \"The Story of a Real Man\" and a subsequent film (1948) directed by Aleksandr Stolper where his name was changed to Meresyev. The novel also inspired Sergei Prokofiev's last opera \"The Story of a Real Man\". In 2005 a documentary called \"Alexey Maresyev. The Fate of a Real Man\" was produced by Channel Russia.\n\n\n\n"}

It includes competitions in various aspects such as painting, elocution and drama. It was started as a town-level event in 1991. Since then the event has gained popularity among the school children, and is now a national level event with thousands of participants from several states of India. Prior to 2017, the event was conducted in Kothagudem in the second week of November. Starting in 2017, the venue has been changed to the Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology, Guntur District, Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn the interests of the Telugu language and to encourage talent and competitive spirit among school children, a town level inter-school festival was organized by the Kothagudem Club for the first time in 1991 with competitions in four categories — essay writing, elocution, general knowledge and painting. In 1995, it was conducted at district level with competitions in eight categories for two days. In 2000, celebrating ten years, this festival was retitled as \"Balotsav\" and was conducted at state level, with 3000 children from six districts of Andhra Pradesh (present day Andhra Pradesh and Telangana).\n\nThe festival is conducted in the second week of November, close to the Children's Day of India. Competitions are held in categories such as painting, elocution, poetry, essay writing, singing, dancing, classical performances, folk performances, crafts, monodrama and letter writing. Most of these competitions are held for the Telugu language, however a few of them such as the spelling bee and public speaking are conducted for the English language as well.\n\nAfter being recognized at state and national level, the number of participants consistently increased. Over the years, the event widened its scope in terms of competition categories and levels. Currently, competitions are held in 36 categories. The annual participation statistics were as follows;\nIn 2012, the 21st iteration of the festival was held from 9 November to 11 November. The special attraction of this iteration was \"Vyarthamtho Artham\" (), and a short film competition. In 2013, the 22nd iteration of the festival was held from 8 November to 10 November. The opening ceremony was launched by one of the youngest authors from India, Nidhi Prakash from Bangalore. The event witnessed 5,112 children from 512 schools. In 2014, the 23rd iteration of the festival was held from 7 November to 9 November, with participants from six different states — Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, Karnataka, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana. The festival attracted 15,000 students from Telangana, and 2,000 students from the other five states. In 2015, the 24th iteration of the festival was held from 12 November to 14 November. It was inaugurated by Shaik Sadhiq Pasha, a high school student who participated in the United Nations General Assembly as a part of the children's delegation. In 2016, to mark the silver jubilee, the 25th iteration of the festival was expanded to four days, from 10 November to 13 November with 29 events. The closing ceremony was presided over by the IT and Municipal Administration Minister of Telangana K. T. Rama Rao.\n\nIn 2017, the 26th iteration of the festival was conducted from 12 November to 14 November. After it was launched in 1991, the original organizers had originally decided to cancel the festival in 2017. Vasireddy Ramesh Babu, convener of several previous iterations, said during a press conferencethat the Vasireddy Venkatadri Institute of Technology (VVIT) had expressed its willingness to host the event, and it was subsequently given the project. It was organized in collaboration with Acharya Nagarjuna University, Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, Andhra Pradesh State Skill Corporation, and Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu Society. More than 12,000 children took part in the festival. The closing ceremony was presided over by the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, Kodela Siva Prasad Rao and Mandali Buddha Prasad.

In actuality, although many analysts believed he was hiding in South Asia, there were no confirmed sightings of bin Laden from December 2001 to May 2011. \nLt. Charles Illsley of the West Valley City Police said that \"When, day after day, media reports focus on a single person like Bundy or bin Laden, it is not too big a leap for somebody to go outside and think they see him. Images stick.\"\n\nAll of these sightings were dismissed after bin Laden was confirmed dead after a U.S. raid in Pakistan on May 1, 2011.\n\nIn the immediate investigation surrounding the attacks, FBI agent Brian Rielly canvassed an apartment block to inquire about Osama Awadallah, and were told by a woman that she had seen Osama bin Laden himself sharing an apartment with the 21-year-old student who was later acquitted.\n\nIn October 2001, a woman, sounding \"very well-meaning and serious about her concern\", told emergency dispatchers that she had encountered Osama bin Laden at a 7-Eleven convenience store in Pleasant View, Utah.\n\nOn December 17, 2001, a man in Colorado Springs, Colorado informed authorities that he had seen the terrorist attending a Rotary Club event earlier in the day.\n\nIn May 2002, a caller phoned police in San Mateo, California, to report that they had just seen Osama bin Laden hanging around the Caltrain station.\n\nIn 2003, a radio caller to George Noory's \"Coast to Coast AM\" reported seeing bin Laden in Florida.\n\nSeveral dozen people had reported seeing bin Laden in Utah; driving a Volkswagen Beetle on I-80, in the mall, at McDonald's, or in a Provo 7-Eleven purchasing a Big Gulp by January 2002. Predominantly a Mormon state, this urban legend relies on the tenuous permittance of plural marriage in Utah, and its generally arid climate, to justify why the leader of al-Qaeda would choose it as his hiding place. In response to the claims, Utah authorities told media that Bin Laden's face had been one of those loaded into a facial recognition program for surveillance cameras at the E Center arena, expected to host the Olympic hockey tournament in 2002.\n\nAn artist in Culver City, California phoned the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to report that she had seen Bin Laden in a local grocery store, and reassured them that she was an artist and knew how to recognize faces and was certain it was him.\n\nIn June 2007, the unemployed Thomas Potter of Olmsted Falls, Ohio, wrote to the Department of Defense, as well as the media, requesting the $25 million reward for finding bin Laden, noting that WhitePages.com had three listings for the shadowy leader; one that suggested he worked at Fox News, another suggesting he worked at Bethesda Interactive Solutions, and a third suggesting he lived in Hermitage, Tennessee.\n\nIn February 2008, a woman reported to police that she had seen Osama bin Laden at the library in Bellingham, Washington.\n\nIn December 2001, \"The New Yorker\" magazine carried a satirical list of leads that the FBI had followed up since the attacks, noting \"#6: Lady in Denver claims she saw Osama bin Laden driving off the fifth tee at her country club.\"\n\nA 2004 Disassociated Press satire suggested that careful analysis of as-Sahab videos indicated bin Laden was hiding in Massachusetts.\n\nWhen a remote Alaskan fishing village, with a total population of only 2,400 residents, received more than $200,000 in federal Homeland Security funds to install surveillance cameras in 2005, it led to jokes about Osama bin Laden hiding in the village.\n\nIn August 2005, a frustrated resident of York, Pennsylvania, told the local newspaper that he had seen bin Laden disappear in the tall weeds around Willis Run, and suggested tongue-in-cheek that perhaps the Department of Homeland Security should finally come take care of the county's weed problem.\n\nIn a 2009 sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\", actors spoofed American politician Sarah Palin informing journalist Katie Couric that she suffered dozens of \"false alarms\" driving through New York, believing she had just seen Bin Laden driving a taxicab.\n\n"}

The parade takes place on the first Sunday of September, in the small town of Zundert in The Netherlands. The floats are large artworks made of steel wire, cardboard, papier-mâché and flowers. In the Bloemencorso Zundert, only dahlias are used to decorate the objects and it takes thousands of them just to cover one float. Around 8 million dahlias are needed for the entire corso. Of these, around 6 million are cultivated in Zundert. It was founded in 1936.\n\nThe huge floats are made by twenty different hamlets and each of them consists of hundreds of builders, aged 1 to 100, who are all equally crazy about the bloemencorso. The older members of the hamlet are often responsible for planting and growing the dahlias, while the younger ones build the float in large temporary tents that are built exclusively for the event. \n\nThe bloemencorso is also a competition. A professional and independent jury decides which float is the most beautiful and which hamlet will be crowned the winner of that year.\n\nThe Netherlands ratified the Unesco Convention for the Protection of Intangible Cultural Heritage on 15 May 2012. This ratification was publicly announced during the parade on 2 September 2012 by State Secretary Halbe Zijlstra. On 13 October 2012, the first traditions were published on the national inventory. The first Dutch tradition on the national inventory is the Bloemencorso Zundert.\n\nBuilding a float for the corso is mainly a social event. Builders of all ages work side by side for over three months to get the float of their hamlet ready on time. It has to be as perfect as possible in order to win the competition. \nThe parade itself takes place on the first Sunday of September, but the members of the hamlets work on their floats all summer. The tents are put up in May or June and from then on the volunteers put all their effort in creating the giant artworks. The last three days before the actual parade are the most stressful. Because the flowers have to be fresh, the hamlets can only start applying the dahlias on the floats on the Thursday before the parade. If necessary, the builders will work day and night to have their float ready on Sunday.\n\nMost people in Zundert will happily give up their days off to work on the float. For these days they use the term Corsokoorts (Corso-fever). The social cohesion that comes from building it is very important. A hamlet is like a family where everyone knows each other and everyone is welcome. After a long evening working on the float people drink a beer together and most hamlets organize all kinds of other activities like song contests and barbecues.\n\nFor years, seventeen hamlets participated in the corso. In recent years, three more decided to enter the competition. Building a float costs a lot of money-- Around 15.000 to 20.000 euros per float, and hundreds of people are needed. Now there are twenty hamlets competing in Bloemencorso Zundert. They are:\n\n\n"}

At least twelve cafés outside the UK are organised by the British Council alone. Similar but independent events have also sprung up in many cities using variations of the \"Café Scientifique\" or \"Science Café\" monikers. Typically, one monthly evening meeting is organised in a café or bar to which one or several scientists are invited to talk in laymen's terms about their work in a topical or even controversial area. The events are known for their informal and friendly atmosphere, and are believed to improve the image of scientists and careers in science. Cafe Scientifique aims to demystify scientific research for the general public and empower non-scientists to more comfortably and accurately assess science and technology issues, particularly those that impact on social policy making.\n\nMany Café Scientifique organisers choose to communicate with each other by means of a centrally-managed mailing list.\n\nThere also is a series of cafés run in schools. These are called Junior Café Scientifique.\n\nCafé Scientifique was first organised by Duncan Dallas in Leeds in 1998, but is based on the Café Philosophique movement which the philosopher Marc Sautet (1947-1998) started in France in 1992.\n\nIn France it was started by scientists who thought they ought to inform the public more, and in the UK it was started by members of the public who wanted to know more about science. In both countries it moved out of an academic structure into popular locations, and thereby attracted audiences.\n\nIt started at a time in the UK where COPUS, the Committee on the Public Understanding of Science(organised by the Royal Society and the British Association for the Advancement of Science), thought that the public did not understand science and needed to be better educated and lectured to. Newspapers considered it very odd that people should go to a café, drink wine and discuss science rather than just gossip. However the public were becoming more concerned about topics like Mad Cow Disease, GM crops, cloning, etc.\n\nDuring the last decade the subject has moved from Public Understanding through Science Communication to Public Engagement and has been embraced by academic disciplines, government departments, research institutes, politicians, educators and policy makers. When it started Café Scientifique was considered weird and avant-garde, however it is now enmeshed in a huge industry.\n\nAlthough Café Scientifique is an idea rather than a particular place, the location is considered important to engender informal scientific debate. The cafe setting is selected to be relaxing, in contrast with a more formal lecture hall setting and everyone attending is given equal respect. The aim of the Café Scientifique is, according to author and neurologist Oliver Sachs \"to bring science back into culture.\" Whereas science is often seen as boring, difficult and mathematical, the aim of the Café Scientifique is to make science relevant, powerful and important, addressing topics such as the universe, climate change, gene mapping and how our brains function. Cafes are assumed to engage and address their local culture. In Britain there is usually one speaker, in Denmark there are two (one non-scientist) and in France often four (as well as a band in the interval). In Japan more respect should be shown to old people, so questions and opinions are done by SMS onto a big screen, so that no one knows the age of the commentator. In Africa topics are down-to-earth – how to live with HIV, avoid Malaria or understand water purification. The Cafes aim to promote a cultural examination of science by local people.\n\nIndividual Cafes have many different names and often don’t require funding – they only pay the speaker’s travelling expenses by asking for donations from the audience. So Cafes provide the opportunity for individuals and groups to initiate many different forms – street science, comedy, music, theatrical readings, dancing, demonstration, etc.\n\nInternet technology has provided the basis for the expansion of Cafes. The main website has provided support for cafes to start up in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. But now individual Cafes are using their websites to expand their audience and prolong the discussion.\n\nCafes have been set up in schools in France, Italy, Britain and now in Africa. Pupils are asked what subjects they would like to discuss, and are then asked to organise, advertise and chair the meeting, which should not take place in a classroom. Usually a speaker (younger rather than older) comes from a local university to talk at the school. Subjects can vary from Flying, Mobile Phones, and The Science of Love to Climate Change.\n\nFinally, efforts are being made to take Cafes to areas which are problematic – to the countryside, Montana in the USA and Cockermouth in the Lake District, UK – to islands, Corfu in Greece and Orkney in Scotland – dangerous areas, Palestine – and immigrants or gypsies in Hungary and the UK. \n\nIn Melbourne, a recent development is 'Campfires and Science' - built on the same principles, but gathering people around the familiar setting of a campfire to learn, share ideas and get involved in doing science. By organising trips into the forest and other wilderness area, the movement hopes to bridge the gap between metropolitan areas and rural areas by encouraging the public to get involved in doing science themselves, such as surveying species and mapping using drones.\n\n\n"}

It was an international day of protest timed to coincide with the 25th G8 summit in Cologne, Germany. The carnival was inspired by the 1980s Stop the City protests and the Global Street Party, which happened at the same time as the 24th G8 Summit in Birmingham, England in 1998. The rallying slogan was \"Our Resistance is as Transnational as Capital\"\n\nPreparations took many months. The day became known as simply J18. In London, the open organising group met every month. The day was also discussed in the open weekly meetings of London Reclaim the Streets. There were between 10 and 100 people at these discussions. An international email discussion list was set up. Fund-raising was carried out by collecting anonymous donations and running a series of benefit gigs.\n\n\"There is only so much that can be learned from how J18 was organised. J18 and the many other successful anti-capitalist events in recent history were produced by a free flowing convergence of events and political currents combined with sheer luck.\"\nIn London, a concerted publicity campaign was carried out, using colourful stickers and 10,000 posters. Workers were encouraged to phone in sick. An eighteen-minute promotional video was made and distributed globally. \"Squaring up to the Square Mile\" was a 32-page pamphlet produced by Reclaim the Streets and Corporate Watch which gave details of financial institutions. An A3 map of the City of London (the \"Square Mile\") showed where they were located. 4,000 copies were produced.\n\nA spoof version of the \"Evening Standard\", daily London-based newspaper was produced. 30,000 copies were printed and distributed on June 17 and 18 to City workers. The cover resembled the layout of the actual newspaper and the inner pages contained agitprop and humour. The newspaper was handed out for free. The headline read 'Global Market Meltdown', followed by a spoof report of the collapse of the world's financial markets.\n\nOn January 29, 1999, the \"Daily Mirror\" ran a full page article entitled \"Police spy bid to smash the anti-car protesters.\"\nCloser to the day, stories abounded in the media about possible violent scenarios.\n\nIt was clear that the City was taking things very seriously. All leave was cancelled for City of London Police officers on the day. The Corporation of London sent letters out to the Managing Director of every firm in the square mile (and many outside it) with instructions to circulate the warning of \"major disruption\" and the need for extra security measures to be taken on June 18 to all staff.\n\nIn London, there was a large march planned for midday and autonomous actions in the morning. Among other actions, a Critical Mass bicycle ride brought the City of London traffic to a standstill in rush hour. The Campaign Against Arms Trade closed down a Lloyds bank with a 'die-in'.\n\nAt twelve, the protesters met at Liverpool Street train station. Food Not Bombs and Veggies Catering Campaign gave out free food and a samba band played. Carnival masks were distributed in four different colours and five processions set off in different directions (there were four marches planned and another occurred spontaneously). The spontaneous procession erupted in anger at London Wall when a woman was hit by a reversing police van and had her leg broken.\n\nBetween two and three o'clock, the marches came together and an estimated 5,000 people converged on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (LIFFE). A fire hydrant was set off, symbolising the freeing of the Walbrook river, and the lower entrance to the LIFFE was bricked up. Banners were hung, reading \"Global Ecology Not Global Economy\", and \"The Earth Is A Common Treasury For All\", the latter a quote from Gerrard Winstanley of the seventeenth century Diggers movement. Graffiti messages were sprayed and CCTV cameras were disabled. Then sound systems set up and drum & bass music and punk bands played.\n\nIn the early afternoon a small group of protesters broke into the Cannon Bridge building, smashed up the reception area and tried to access the LIFFE trading floor, but were prevented by a security screen.\n\n\"We'd failed in our under-ambition. Unprepared, we never imagined we could get so close to occupying a trading floor in one of the City’s major exchanges. We'd planned the wall, and built it. We'd planned to free the Walbrook, and done it. But we’d stopped short of planning a full-scale occupation\" according to Wat Tyler in 2003.\n\nThe rest of the afternoon became a battle as police using horses and personal incapacitant spray containing CS gas pushed the protesters down Lower Thames Street and out of the City of London. In the aftermath, protesters gathered peacefully in Trafalgar Square.\n\nThe event was covered by live streaming and internet citizen journalism, which at the time were new. In London, the day's events were transmitted live by VJ Matt Black over the internet until the servers were blocked up by the sheer volume of traffic. In Australia, CAT TV and Active Sydney got a team together for all day coverage. They collected stories, photos and videos from activists and published them in a news feed. The global networking of activists, and technology created, formed the basis of the Indymedia network.\n\nThe electronic civil disobedience group called for a virtual sit-in of the Mexican embassy in London and brought the embassy website to a standstill.\n\nOn June 23, 1999, Undercurrents, the alternative news organisation, premiered a 30-minute documentary in Oxford about the day produced from the pooled footage of a dozen video operators in London. The documentary was shown at festivals and social centres all over the UK during the following months.\n\nIn Nigeria, 10,000 people took to the streets of Port Harcourt. A street was renamed in honour of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his younger brother Owens addressed the crowd.\n\nKatherine Ainger described the global atmosphere of protest:\n\nThe June 18 events were as diverse as the groups taking part. In Barcelona \"street reclaimers\" invoked the slogan of the rebellious Paris students of 1968, \"Sous les paves, la plage\" (\"Under the sidewalk, the beach\") and, dressed in swimming costumes, put out towels and sun-bathed on the road, handed out French fries to commuters in their cars, and later took part in a 700-strong street party. Music and dancing also hit the streets of San Francisco with \"art attackers\" who, armed with giant puppets and candy, lobbied those working for multinationals that exploit sweatshop workers to take the day off work and \"join the revolution.\" In Melbourne, Australia, Kim Beazley, leader of the opposition, received a custard pie in the face for speaking at a global trade conference sponsored by Shell, while thousands of party goers in Sydney held up traffic as a massive street festival got underway.\"\n\nIn total there were protests in 40 countries, these included Tel Aviv, Minsk, Madrid, Valencia, Prague, Hamburg, Cologne, Milan, Rome, Siena, Florence, Ancona, Amsterdam, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Lancaster, Zurich, Geneva, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Washington, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Texas, Boston, and Eugene, Oregon.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, James B***K (last name masked by individual) pleaded guilty in January 2004 to Section 20 Unlawful Wounding (GBH) and two violent disorder charges, plus an additional charge of skipping bail in 2000. He received a four and a half year sentence.\nA total of sixteen people were arrested on the day. The Metropolitan Police made a website listing 138 photographs of those wanted for further questioning. Using CCTV footage extensively, they had arrested a further 50 people one year on.\n\nIn Eugene, Oregon Rob Thaxton was sentenced to 88 months in jail after throwing a rock at a police officer while trying to avoid being arrested.\n\nOthers who had been identified at the Carnival were arrested at later events, particularly the 30 November WTO protests.\n\nJ18 was the first in the line of huge anti-capitalist and anti-globalisation protests. Since then there have been many protests, the largest being the following:\n\n\n\n"}

The series format was a mix of sprints, hillclimbs and circuit races.\n\nThe initial cars were live axle 1600cc Ford 'Kent' Crossflows with rear-exit exhausts. The spec included a Caterham lightened & balanced flywheel, uprated competition clutch cover and drive plate, Caterham distributor with Ignitor electronic ignition, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 120, 30mm venturi, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 100 bhp at 6000 rpm. They ran on list 1A Michelin MXT tyres.\n\nIn 1998, the engine supplier changed to Vauxhall, with 1600 single overhead cam engines being used. They featured a ported & skimmed cylinder head, standard Vauxhall camshaft, flywheel and clutch cover plate, two Weber twin choke 40 DCOE 151 (sidedraft) carburettors, main jets size 115, with K&N performance filters. The maximum power was 101 ps at 5,500 rpm and a max torque of 107 lb ft at 3,600 rpm. The main visual difference between the Fords and the Vauxhalls was that the Vauxhalls had a side-exit exhaust, as opposed to the rear exit of the Fords.\n\nThe early Vauxhall cars used the same Spax dampers with manual adjusters as the Fords, with an option to adjustable spring platforms.\n\nThe 1999 and 2000 Vauxhall cars had linear coil springs over Bilstein (rather than Spax) dampers, again with the option of adjustable spring platforms, to optimise corner-weighting.\n\nFor the 2000 season, the Scholarship was rebranded the \"Caterham Academy\"\n\nFor the 2001 Academy, cars were supplied with the more modern Dedion chassis, and a Rover K series engine. An increasing number of cars were supplied with full rollover cages by this point, although it was not until 2003 that all Academy cars came with a full cage rather than a FIA-spec rollover bar and supporting strut in the passenger footwell.\n\nCars were supplied with the Caterham (Arch Motors) race chassis in 2001 and 2002. This is recognisable by a shorter passenger footwell (to accommodate the battery in the engine bay) and the handbrake under the dash on the passenger side. Cars from 2003 to 2006 were supplied with a centre (tunnel) handbrake.\n\nFrom 2004, the Academy chassis was modified slightly and made more rigid. The transmission tunnel was raised slightly, and all cars were supplied with a lowered floorpan, giving the driver a couple of inches more headroom under the rollcage. The rollcage supplier changed at this point, as cars were supplied with 'Caged' rollover cages with slightly curved bars and different frontal load protection, rather than the 'Safety Devices' cages with straight diagonal bars of 2001 to 2003.\n\n2005 cars were supplied with the new style combined side-impact and wheel intrusion bar, which allows the doors to open (the older style bar does not).\n\n2006 cars were supplied with a new D-style 'Caged' rollcage. 2006 was the last year of the Arch Motors Academy chassis.\n\nIn 2007, manufacture of the Academy chassis was moved to 'Caged' in Bristol, and the chassis were now largely computer-made and metric rather than imperial in their measurements. Other than that, the chassis were much the same as the 2004-onwards ones, albeit with some modifications in the engine bay area to accommodate the upcoming Sigma engines. The engines remained the Rover K-series for 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Caterham moved from the K-series to the Ford Sigma engine, supplied in a 1.6 litre format. The Caged chassis was modified to incorporate the new engine (such as the exhaust exiting on the right via a 4-branch system with separate catalytic converter), and a number of new parts were manufactured.\n\nThe current Academy package (2014) is that for £21,495, entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (although a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a setup day, three speed events (sprints and hillclimbs), and four circuit races.\n\nIn recent years there have been 2 Academy groups, each of 28 drivers. For 2009, there were plans to run 3 groups of 28 entrants, but ultimately this did not come to pass. 2010's Academy also has two groups.\n\nThere is now a considerable amount of racing choice available for cars and drivers who have completed the Academy, both in the Caterham Motorsport Ladder and in the Caterham Graduates Racing Club.\n\nA number of drivers leave the Caterham Academy and move on to other forms of racing, and an equal number sell up and never race again. But most move into either Roadsport B or Roadsport A or into Grads racing.\n"}

Urban legends are, as Patricia T. O'Conner of The New York Times described, \"fictitious narratives that are passed from person to person in the guise of true stories and sometimes persist until they reach the status of folklore.\" The story of the choking doberman fits into this category of folklore and generally involves a protective pet found by its owner gagging on human fingers lodged in its throat. As the story unfolds, the dog's owner discovers an intruder whose hand is bleeding from the dog bite.\n\nJan Harold Brunvand, a folklorist and professor emeritus of English at the University of Utah, wrote about this and other urban legends in his book \"The Choking Doberman and Other \"New\" Urban Legends\" published in 1984 by W.W. Norton & Company. He provided the reader with several varying accounts of the story. While the basic elements of the story remain the same in each version, the details, such as the number of fingers found, the breed of dog, and the condition of the intruder when discovered change slightly.\n\nA woman goes out for the evening with friends. Upon her return, she is greeted by her pet Doberman choking in the hallway. Alarmed, she takes the pet to the veterinarian. The vet announces that he must perform a tracheotomy on the animal and he will call her when he has news. When the woman arrives home, the vet calls and tells her to leave the house at once. The dog was choking on three human fingers. The woman calls the police, who search the house. They discover the burglar, hiding in a closet, passed out from blood loss caused by having three fingers bitten off.\n\nIn his book Brunvard cites an 1800 CE fable about Llewellyn and his dog Gellert as the oldest known ancestor of the story. In that story the prince Llewellyn leaves his son at home with his guardian dog Gellert. Upon returning from hunting the hound greets him with a bloody face and he, thinking the animal has eaten the child, immediately slays it. When he investigates the nursery the prince discovers the child playing with the hair of a slain wolf that Gellert had saved the baby from.\n\nIn her 1992 paper \"The Ambiguous Guardians\" Adrienne Mayor cites the fifth century CE narrative \"The Omen of the Wolf\" as an earlier echo of both the 1800 fable and the urban legend as it is today. In this myth the emperor Honorius's retinue was attacked by a pair of wolves. When the beasts were killed they were found to have a pair of human hands in their bellies. Their aggressive behavior - coupled with the awful last meal - were taken as a sinister sign and rumors lit a panic in Rome. The emperor's official propagandist, Claudian, attempted to counter the popular understanding of the sign with his poem \"The Gothic War\".\n\nThe first verifiable appearance of the legend is in the Phoenix New Times on June 24, 1981, pictured to the right.\n\nFrom the article, in part:\n\n\"Gagging Dog Story Baffles Police\"\n\n\nRonald B. Tobias cites the story as an example of oral tradition that through repeated retelling has become \"plot perfect\".\n\nThis story appears in the 1991 Judith Gorog novel On Meeting Witches at Wells.\n\nThere is a margarita named the Choking Doberman made with habañero-infused tequila at Big Daddy's in Massapequa, New York.\n\nThe story also appears in Season 1, episode 1 of from 21:00 to 28:55\n\n\nUrban Legends Season 1 Episode 1 on YouTube\n"}

Its long title was \"An Act to amend the Law relating to Cruelty to Animals (15th August 1876).\" The Act was replaced 110 years later by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.\n\nThe Act stipulated that researchers would be prosecuted for cruelty, unless they conformed to its provisions, which required that an experiment involving the infliction of pain upon animals to only be conducted when \"\"the proposed experiments are absolutely necessary for the due instruction of the persons\" [so they may go onto use the instruction] \"to save or prolong human life\"\".\n\nFurthermore, the Act stated that should the experiment occur, the animal must be anaesthetised, used only once (though several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted), and killed as soon as the study was over. Prosecutions under the Act could be made only with the approval of the Secretary of State. The Act was applicable to vertebrate animals only.\n\nOpposition to vivisection had led the government to set up a Royal Commission on Vivisection in July 1875, which recommended that legislation be enacted to control it.

He was charged with aggravated fraud and forgery; his criminal trial started in Oslo District Court in 2018, and he pled guilty to all charges. On 18 June 2018 Malthe-Sørenssen was convicted of aggravated fraud and forgery of documents, and sentenced to three years in prison and to pay his victims over seven million Norwegian kroner in restitution. He has changed his names several times, but is best known under the name Geir Selvik Malthe-Sørenssen, his legal name from 2010 to 2017.\n\nMalthe-Sørenssen grew up in Bærum and started his journalistic career in the local newspaper \"Asker og Bærums Budstikke\". He later worked in \"Bergens Arbeiderblad\", \"Dagbladet\" and \"Se og Hør\", and as an editor with \"Nettavisen\" and the TV3 television show \"Etterlyst\" (\"Wanted\"). He then left journalism to work as a private detective, and has been a paid private detective on behalf of several defendants in criminal cases.

The book was written on behalf of Treholt and Malthe-Sørenssen was paid by Treholt for his work. The book led to much controversy and to a new evaluation of the Treholt case by the Criminal Cases Review Commission.

{"id": "287291", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=287291", "title": "Great Depression in the United Kingdom", "text": "Great Depression in the United Kingdom\n\nThe Great Depression in the United Kingdom, also known as the Great Slump, was a period of national economic downturn in the 1930s, which had its origins in the global Great Depression. It was Britain's largest and most profound economic depression of the 20th century. The Great Depression originated in the United States in late 1929 and quickly spread to the world. Britain had never experienced the boom that had characterized the U.S., Germany, Canada and Australia in the 1920s, so its effect appeared less severe. Britain's world trade fell by half (1929–33), the output of heavy industry fell by a third, employment profits plunged in nearly all sectors. At the depth in summer 1932, registered unemployed numbered 3.5 million, and many more had only part-time employment.\n\nParticularly hardest hit by economic problems were the industrial and mining areas in the north of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. Unemployment reached 70% in some areas at the start of the 1930s (with more than 3 million out of work nationally) and many families depended entirely on payments from local government known as the dole. Politically the Conservative Party dominated the era and the Labour Party was seriously hurt.\n\nThe Great Depression of 1929–32 broke out at a time when the United Kingdom was still far from having recovered from the effects of the First World War. Economist Lee Ohanian showed that economic output fell by 25% between 1918 and 1921 and did not recover until the end of the Great Depression, arguing that the United Kingdom suffered a twenty-year great depression beginning in 1918. Relative to the rest of the world, economic output declined mildly in the UK between 1929 and 1934.\n\nHeavy industries which formed the bedrock of Britain's export trade (such as coalmining, shipbuilding and steel) were heavily concentrated in certain areas of Britain, such as northern England, South Wales, Northern Ireland and central Scotland, while the newer industries were heavily concentrated in southern and central England. British industrial output during the 1920s ran at about 80–100%, and exports at about 80% of their pre-war levels. \nFrom about 1921, Britain had started a slow economic recovery from the war and the subsequent slump. But in April 1925, the Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer, Winston Churchill, on advice from the Bank of England, restored the Pound Sterling to the gold standard at its prewar exchange rate of $4.86 US dollars to one pound. This made the pound convertible to its value in gold, but at a level that made British exports more expensive on world markets. The price of gold was over-estimated by 10–14% leading to coal and steel as an export becoming less competitive. The economic recovery was immediately slowed. To offset the effects of the high exchange rate, the export industries tried to cut costs by lowering workers' wages.\n\nThe industrial areas spent the rest of the 1920s in recession, and these industries received little investment or modernisation. Throughout the 1920s, unemployment stayed at a steady one million.\n\nIn May 1929, a minority Labour government headed by Ramsay MacDonald came to office with Liberal support. This was only the second time a Labour government had been in office (they had briefly been in office in 1924), and few of the government's members had any deep knowledge of economics or experience of running the economy. MacDonald's Labour Party was not radical in economic thinking, and was wedded to the orthodoxy of classical economics with its emphasis on maintaining a balanced budget at any cost.\n\nIn October 1929, the Stock Market Crash in New York heralded the worldwide Great Depression. John Maynard Keynes, who had not predicted the slump, said, \"'There will be no serious direct consequences in London. We find the look ahead decidedly encouraging.\"\n\nDoomsayers on the left such as Sidney and Beatrice Webb, J.A. Hobson, and G.D.H. Cole repeated the dire warnings they had been making for years about the imminent death of capitalism, only now far more people paid attention. Starting in 1935 the Left Book Club provided a new warning every month, and built up the credibility of Soviet-style socialism as an alternative.\n\nThe ensuing American economic collapse shook the world: World trade contracted, prices fell and governments faced financial crisis as the supply of American credit dried up. Many countries adopted an emergency response to the crisis by erecting trade barriers and tariffs, which worsened the crisis by further hindering global trade. The British Empire tried to hang together by lower tariffs among the members while raising them against the U.S. and others.\n\nThe effects on the industrial areas of Britain were immediate and devastating, as demand for British products collapsed. By the end of 1930, unemployment had more than doubled from 1 million to 2.5 million (from 12% to 20% of the insured workforce), and exports had fallen in value by 50%. During this time there were little to no unemployment benefits, so this mass unemployment lead to many of Britain’s population becoming impoverished. Government revenues contracted as national income fell, while the cost of assisting the jobless rose. The industrial areas were hardest hit, along with the coal mining districts. London and the south-east of England were hurt less. In 1933, 30% of Glaswegians were unemployed due to the severe decline in heavy industry.\n\nUnder pressure from its Liberal allies as well as the Conservative opposition, the Labour government appointed a committee to review the state of public finances. The May Report of July 1931 urged public sector wage cuts and large cuts in public spending (notably in benefit payments (\"dole\") to the unemployed) to avoid incurring a budget deficit. The sense was that the deficit was dangerous and had to be reduced; the proposal was to meet £24 million by increased taxes on the rich, and £96 million by economies, of which £64 million would come from unemployment relief. This proposal proved deeply unpopular within the Labour Party and among its main supporters, the trade unions, which along with several government ministers refused to support any such measures. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Snowden, insisted that the Report's recommendations be adopted to avoid incurring a budget deficit.\n\nIn a memorandum in January 1930, one junior government minister, Oswald Mosley, proposed that the government should take control of banking and exports, as well as increase pensions to boost purchasing power. When his ideas were turned down, he left Labour to form the New Party, and later the British Union of Fascists.\n\nThe dispute over spending and wage cuts split the Labour government: as it turned out, beyond recovery. The resulting political deadlock caused investors to take fright, and a flight of capital and gold further de-stabilised the economy. In response, MacDonald, on the urging of King George V, decided to form a \"National Government\" with the Conservatives and the Liberals.\n\nOn 24 August, MacDonald submitted the resignation of his ministers and led his senior colleagues in forming the new National Government. MacDonald and his supporters were expelled from the Labour Party and adopted the label \"National Labour\". The Labour Party and some Liberals, led by David Lloyd George, went into opposition. The Labour Party denounced MacDonald as a \"traitor\" and a \"rat\" for what they saw as his betrayal.\n\nSoon after this, a general election was called. The 1931 general election resulted in a Conservative landslide victory, with the now leaderless Labour Party winning only 46 seats in Parliament. After the 1931 election the national government became Conservative-dominated, although MacDonald continued as prime minister until 1935.\n\nIn an effort to balance the budget and restore confidence in the pound, on 10 September 1931 with Philip Snowden still as Chancellor, the new national government issued an emergency budget, which immediately instituted a round of cuts in public spending and wages. Public sector wages and unemployment pay were cut by 10%, and income tax was raised from 4s 6d to 5s in the pound (from 22.5% to 25%). The pay cuts did not go down well, however, and resulted in a non-violent \"mutiny\" in the Royal Navy protesting pay cut.\n\nThese measures were deflationary and merely reduced purchasing power in the economy, worsening the situation, and by the end of 1931 unemployment had reached nearly 3 million. The measures were also unsuccessful at defending the gold standard, which the National Government had ostensibly been created to defend.\n\nThe flight of gold continued, however, and the Treasury finally was forced to abandon the gold standard in September 1931. Until now the government had religiously followed orthodox policies, which demanded balanced-budgets and the gold standard. Instead of the predicted disaster, cutting loose from gold proved a major advantage. Immediately the exchange rate of the pound fell by 25%, from $4.86 for one pound to $3.40. British exports were now much more competitive, which laid the ground for a gradual economic recovery. The worst was over.\n\nAlso, in 1932 following the Ottawa Agreement, Neville Chamberlain, who had become Chancellor after the 1931 election, introduced tariffs on industrial and agricultural imports at a rate of 10% on all imports except those from the countries of the British Empire. The introduction of tariffs caused a split in the Liberal Party, some of whom, along with Phillip Snowden, withdrew support for the National Government.\n\nAlthough the overall picture for the British economy in the 1930s was bleak, the effects of the depression were uneven. Some parts of the country, and some industries, fared better than others. Some parts of the country such as the South Wales Valleys experienced mass unemployment and poverty, while some areas in the Home Counties did not.\n\nThe brightest spot was in home building. From 1926 through 1939 over 200,000 new houses were built every year, with the peak reaching 365,000 in 1936. Many suburban districts in London and other cities were built at this time, and Brighton shows many signs of more \"high deco\" home architecture.\n\nIn London and the south east of England unemployment was initially as high as 13.5%, the later 1930s were a prosperous time in these areas, as a suburban house-building boom was fuelled by the low interest rates which followed the abolition of the gold standard, and as London's growing population buoyed the economy of the Home Counties.\n\nThe south was also the home of new developing industries such as the electrical industry, which prospered from the large-scale electrification of housing and industry. Mass production methods brought new products such as electrical cookers, washing machines and radios into the reach of the middle classes, and the industries which produced these prospered. Nearly half of all new factories that opened in Britain between 1932 and 1937 were in the Greater London area.\n\nAnother industry that prospered during the 1930s was the British motor industry. For cities that had a developed motor industry such as Birmingham, Coventry and Oxford, the 1930s were also a boom time. Manufacturers such as Austin, Morris and Ford dominated the motor industry during the 1930s, and the number of cars on British roads doubled within the decade. British Agriculture also flourished in the 1930s.\n\nNorthern England, however, was a quite different matter. The north was the home to most of Britain's traditional heavy industries, such as coal mining in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire, shipbuilding on Tyneside and Wearside, steel in Sheffield and textiles in Lancashire which were heavily export orientated. The north bore the brunt of the depression, and the '30s were the most difficult time in living memory for people in these areas. The north was hit so hard in the Great Depression because of the structural decline in British industry. Staple industries such as coal, steel and shipbuilding were smaller, less modern and efficient and over-staffed compared to continental rivals.\n\nIn the north east (including Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Newcastle-upon-Tyne) this was especially so. The north east was a major centre of the shipbuilding industry. The Depression caused a collapse in demand for ships. Between 1929 and 1932 ship production declined by 90%, and this in turn affected all the supply industries such as steel and coal. In some towns and cities in the north east, unemployment reached as high as 70%. Among the worst affected towns was Jarrow, where unemployment led to the famous Jarrow March, in which unemployed workers marched to London to protest against unemployment.\n\nThe north west, a centre of the textile industries, was also hard hit, with places such as Manchester and Lancashire suffering a slump. The South Wales Valleys, a centre of the coalmining and steel industries, was also devastated by the depression where towns such as Merthyr Tydfil and Swansea had unemployment rates reaching above 25% at certain times. The industrial belt of central Scotland, also a major shipbuilding centre in Glasgow, was also hard hit by the slump.\n\nIn these areas, millions of unemployed and their families were left destitute, and queueing at soup kitchens became a way of life. A government report in the mid-1930s estimated that around 25% of the UK's population existed on a subsistence diet, often with signs of child malnutrition such as scurvy, rickets and tuberculosis. In his book \"The Road to Wigan Pier\", George Orwell described life for the unemployed in northern England during the depression: \"Several hundred men risk their lives and several hundred women scrabble in the mud for hours... searching eagerly for tiny chips of coal in slagheaps so they could heat their own homes. For them, this arduously-gained 'free' coal was more important almost than food.\"\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Britain had a relatively advanced welfare system compared to many of the industrialised countries. In 1911, a compulsory national unemployment and health insurance scheme had been put in place by the Liberal government of Herbert Henry Asquith (see Liberal reforms). This scheme had been funded through contributions from the government, the employers and the workers. At first, the scheme only applied to certain trades but, in 1920, it was expanded to include most manual workers.\n\nHowever, the scheme only paid out according to the level of contributions made rather than according to need, and was only payable for 15 weeks. Anyone unemployed for longer than that had to rely on poor law relief paid by their local authority. In effect, millions of workers who had been too poorly paid to make contributions, or who had been unemployed long term, were left destitute by the scheme. With the mass unemployment of the 1930s, contributions to the insurance scheme dried up, resulting in a funding crisis.\n\nIn August 1931, the 1911 scheme was replaced by a fully government-funded unemployment benefit system. This system, for the first time, paid out according to need rather than the level of contributions. This unemployment benefit was subject to a strict means test, and anyone applying for unemployment pay had to have an inspection by a government official to make sure that they had no hidden earnings or savings, undisclosed source(s) of income or other means of support. For many poor people, this was a humiliating experience and was much resented.\n\nFollowing Britain's withdrawal from the gold standard and the devaluation of the pound, interest rates were reduced from 6% to 2%. As a result, British exports became more competitive on world markets than those of countries that remained on the gold standard. This led to a modest economic recovery, and a fall in unemployment from 1933 onwards. Although exports were still a fraction of their pre-depression levels, they recovered slightly.\n\nUnemployment began a modest fall in 1934 and fell further in 1935 and 1936, but the rise in employment levels occurred mostly in the south, where lower interest rates had spurred the house building boom, which in turn spurred a recovery in domestic industry. The North and Wales remained severely depressed for most of the decade. In severely depressed parts of the country, the government enacted a number of policies to stimulate growth and reduce unemployment, including road building, loans to shipyards, and tariffs on steel imports. These policies helped but were not, however, on a sufficiently large scale to make a huge impact on the unemployment levels.\n\nSince Britain’s debt was 180% of the national GDP it was difficult to recover. The United Kingdom was able to recover more quickly than other countries that were equally as developed, because their economic growth had been stagnant for some time. This meant that they did not have exponential growth, as the United States did, leaving them with less room to fall. Due to the abandonment of the gold standard in 1931 Britain was able to cut interest rates which led to a drop in real interest rates. This drop in interests rates subsequently led to a boom in construction in the south of Britain; stimulating some renewed economic growth. Also, the government began spending money on goods and services within Britain which aided in the foundation of financial recovery. \nFrom 1936 onwards, the National Government followed a policy of mass rearmament in the face of the rise of Nazi Germany. By 1937 unemployment had fallen to 1.5 million, but rose again to 1,810,000 by January 1938 suggesting that the recovery was to be short lived.\nFollowing the end of the Second World War, the majority of the British people, and particularly the working class and returning servicemen and women, did not want a return to pre-war Conservative economic policies, which they blamed for the hardship of the 1930s, and there was a mood for widespread social change. At the 1945 general election, to the surprise of many observers, Winston Churchill was defeated by the Labour Party headed by Clement Attlee.\n\nThe Labour government built up from pre-war foundations what was to become a comprehensive 'cradle-to-grave' welfare state, and established a tax funded National Health Service, which gave treatment according to need rather than ability to pay as the previous tax funded system had been. The Labour government also enacted Keynesian economic policies, to create artificial economic demand leading to full employment. These policies became known as the \"post-war consensus\", and were accepted by all major political parties at different times.\n\nThere were noted disagreements about the involvement of the state with the steel industry. With one government, it was state owned, to then be sold off with the following conservative administration only to be then re-nationalised by the following labour government. For the most part, the post-war consensus lasted until the late 1970s. Throughout the 1970s, it was becoming clear from all sides that radical change was needed as a result of such economic crises as the 1973 oil shock, high inflation, industrial unrest and sterling devaluation. But 1970s governments lacked the necessary political will, leadership and the House of Commons majority from which to change the system until the Conservatives led by Margaret Thatcher won the 1979 general election.\n\nThe events of the 1930s, and the response of the Labour and National governments to the depression, have generated much historical controversy.\n\nIn the decades immediately following the Second World War, most historical opinion was critical of the governments of the period. Certain historians, such as Robert Skidelsky in his \"Politicians and the Slump\", compared the orthodox policies of the Labour and National governments unfavourably with the more radical proto-Keynesian measures advocated by David Lloyd George and Oswald Mosley, and the more interventionist and Keynesian responses in other economies: Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal in the United States, the Labour government in New Zealand, and the Social Democratic government in Sweden. Since the 1970s opinion has become less uniformly hostile. In the preface to the 1994 edition, Skidelsky argues that recent experience of currency crises and capital flight make it hard to be so critical of the politicians who wanted to achieve stability by cutting labour costs and defending the value of the currency.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "3240218", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3240218", "title": "Guru Nanak Gurpurab", "text": "Guru Nanak Gurpurab\n\nGuru Nanak Gurpurab, also known as Guru Nanak's Prakash Utsav and Guru Nanak Jayanti, celebrates the birth of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak. This is one of the most sacred festivals in Sikhism, or Sikhi. \n\nThe festivities in the Sikh religion revolve around the anniversaries of the 10 Sikh Gurus. These Gurus were responsible for shaping the beliefs of the Sikhs. Their birthdays, known as \"Gurpurab,\" are occasions for celebration and prayer among the Sikhs.\n\nGuru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, was born on Vaisakhi Day, (Vaisakh 1, 1526 Bikrami) in Rai-Bhoi-di Talwandi in the present Shekhupura District of Pakistan, now Nankana Sahib. It is a Gazetted holiday in India.\n\nAccording to the controversial Bhai Bala Janamsakhi, it claims Guru Nanak was born on the Full Moon (Pooranmashi) of the Indian Lunar Month Katik. The Sikhs have been celebrating Guru Nanak's Gurpurab around November for this reason and has it been ingrained in Sikh Traditions.\n\nHowever, some scholars and organizations believe the Birthday should be celebrated on Vaisakhi, which falls on April 14 according to the original Nanakshahi Calendar passed by Sri Akal Takht in 2003. However, many people and organizations would like to keep the traditional date by celebrating on the Full Moon Day (Pooranmashi or Purnima) of the Lunar Month Kartik. The original Nanakshahi Calendar follows the tradition and celebrates it on Kartik Purnima due to demands by various Sikh Saints. \n\nThe celebration is generally similar for all Sikhs; only the hymns are different. The celebrations usually commence with Prabhat Pheris. Prabhat Pheris are early morning processions that begin at the Gurudwaras and proceed around the localities singing hymns. Generally, two days before the birthday, \"Akhand Path\" (a forty-eight-hour non-stop reading of the \"Guru Granth Sahib\", the holy book of the Sikhs) is held in the \"Gurdwaras\".\n\nThe day prior to the birthday, a procession, referred to as Nagarkirtan, is organised. This procession is led by the \"Panj Pyaras\" (Five Beloved Ones). They head the procession carrying the Sikh flag, known as the \"Nishan Sahib\" and the \"Palki\" (Palanquin) of Guru Granth Sahib. They are followed by teams of singers singing hymns and devotees sing the chorus. There are brass bands playing different tunes and 'Gatka' teams display their swordsmanship through various martial arts and as mock battles using traditional weapons. The procession pours into the streets of the town. The passage is covered with banners and gates decorated flags and flowers, for this special occasion. The leaders spreading the message of Guru Nanak.\nOn the day of the Gurpurab, the celebrations commence early in the morning at about 4 to 5 a.m. This time of the day is referred to as \"Amrit Vela\". The day begins with the singing of \"Asaa-Ki-Vaar\" (morning hymns). This is followed by any combination of \"Katha\" (exposition of the scripture) and \"Kirtan\" (hymns from the Sikh scriptures), in the praise of the Guru. Following that is the \"Langar\", a special community lunch, which is arranged at the \"Gurudwaras\" by volunteers. The idea behind the free communal lunch is that everyone, irrespective of caste, class or creed, should be offered food in the spirit of \"seva\" (service) and \"bhakti\" (devotion). \n\nNight Prayer sessions are also held in some Gurudwaras, which begin around sunset when Rehras(evening prayer) is recited, followed by Kirtan till late at night. The congregation starts singing Gurbani at about 1:20 a.m., which is the actual time of birth of Guru Nanak. The celebrations culminate at around 2 a.m.\n\nGuru Nanak Gurpurab is celebrated by the Sikh community all over the world and is one of the most important festivals in the Sikh calendar. The celebrations are especially colorful in Punjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh and many more locations. Even some Sindhis celebrate this festival.\n\n \n"}
{"id": "428865", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=428865", "title": "Ironic (song)", "text": "Ironic (song)\n\n\"Ironic\" is a song by Canadian-American singer Alanis Morissette. It was released in February 1996 as the third single from her third studio album, \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995). It was written by Morissette and Glen Ballard, and was produced by him. \"Ironic\" is a song written in the key of B major, and includes a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. The lyrics present several situations that are described as \"ironic\"; this has led to debate as to whether any of these actually match the accepted meaning of \"irony\". However, some have argued that it does match what is known as situational irony.\n\nThe track topped the Canadian \"RPM\" Top Singles chart for six weeks, and reached the top five in Australia, New Zealand and Norway. In the United States, the song reached number four on April 13, 1996, and currently is her highest-charting single on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Ironic\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The song won the Juno Award for Single of the Year, and received two Grammy Award nominations in 1997, for Record of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video. French director Stéphane Sednaoui filmed the music video. In it, Morissette drives through a winter landscape, and she plays multiple roles as her passengers. MTV nominated the music video for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996, winning three of them. The music video was listed on VH1's \"Greatest Music Videos\" list and was parodied by DBA Flip, Allison Rheaume and \"Weird Al\" Yankovic.\n\nIn 2004, Morissette changed the lyrics of \"Ironic\" to denote her support for same-sex marriage at the fifteenth GLAAD Media Awards. This version was included on her albums \"iTunes Originals\" (2004) and \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\" (2005), and was performed at the House of Blues in 2005, along with Canadian singer Avril Lavigne. \"Ironic\" was included on the set list of her Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995), and her compilation albums \"MTV Unplugged\" (1999), (2005), among others. The song was covered by Mexican duet Jesse & Joy for their album \"Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones\" (2007), and by American band Four Year Strong for their cover album \"Explains It All\" (2009).\n\n\"Ironic\" was written by Alanis Morissette and Glen Ballard, and produced by the former for her third studio album, \"Jagged Little Pill\" (1995). In an interview with Christopher Walsh of \"Billboard\", Ballard explained how he and Morissette met, and how \"Ironic\" was written. He commented: \"I'm telling you, within 15 minutes we were at it—just writing. 'Ironic' was the third song we wrote. Oh God, we were just having fun. I thought 'I don't know what this is—what genre it is—who knows? It's just good\". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, it is a song set in the time signature of common time, composed in a moderate tempo of eighty-two beats per minute. It is set in the key of B major with Morissette's vocal range from the tone of E to B, and \"Ironic\" chord progression starts with the sequence of Emaj7–F♯6–Emaj7–F♯6, before changing to F♯–Badd9–F♯–G♯m7 in the chorus.\n\nThe song's usage of the word \"ironic\" attracted media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of \"The New York Times\", the song gives a distinct \"unironic\" sense in its implications. According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" \"irony\" is \"a figure of speech in which the intended meaning is the opposite of that expressed by the words used\". Thus, lyrics such as \"It's like rain on your wedding day\" and \"A traffic jam when you're already late\" are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: \"For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that every once in a while I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic\". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts wrote for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term \"ironic\", as he states that the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the \"state of affairs or event[s] that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often wryly amusing as a result\", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be \"ironic\". Michael Stevens of the YouTube channel Vsauce devoted time to the discussion of irony in the 2014 episode \"Dord\". In this video, Stevens considers the difference between the typically cited \"situational\" irony, versus \"dramatic\" irony. According to him, the irony of the song may not necessarily be in the situations themselves, but rather in the dramatic irony – when someone is unaware of the significance of the event while others are: the situations aren't ironic themselves, but life itself is ironic.\n\nComedian Ed Byrne performed a skit in which he jokingly attacked the song for its lack of ironies: \"The only ironic thing about that song is it's called 'Ironic' and it's written by a woman who doesn't know what irony is. That's quite ironic.\" Also, satirists Berger and Wyse parodied the song in one segment of their cartoon strip \"The Pitchers\". In that episode, a superhero named \"Irony Man\" compared his superpowers to lyrics from Morissette's song, causing his cohorts to rename him \"The Man from Alanis\". In December 2009, the comedy website \"CollegeHumor\" released a spoof video of the song called \"Actually Ironic\", featuring actress Sarah Natochenny, in which Patrick Cassels amended the lyrics in a form that would be appropriately ironic. For example, \"it's like rain on your wedding day, to the Egyptian sun god Ra.\" The \"CollegeHumor\" spoof was similarly replicated in July 2013 with a song called, \"It's Finally Ironic\" by sisters Rachael and Eliza Hurwitz, from New York City, who published their version on YouTube. The sisters adjusted the lyrics to reflect irony (e.g., \"it's a black fly in your chardonnay, that was specifically purchased to repel black flies\") and sing the line \"We fixed it for you, Alanis. You're welcome.\" throughout their video. In his 2014 song \"Word Crimes\", \"Weird Al\" Yankovic references Morissette's lyrics by singing \"Irony is not coincidence\", and the music video for the song shows a fire truck burning (depicted as \"Irony\") compared with rain during a wedding (which is described as \"Weather\"). Morissette herself poked fun at her grammar mistakes during a 2013 performance of \"Semicolon\" with The Lonely Island on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". In it, Morissette cut off their song to explain that their use of hashtag rap to demonstrate the function of a semicolon is incorrect, to which they respond that her critiquing their grammar is \"ironic\".\n\nJaime Gill from Dot Music commented on the original version of \"Ironic\", on his review of \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\" (2005), that \"[\"Jagged Little Pill\"] gave us pop's greatest parlour game, with spot the genuine irony in 'Ironic'\" and calling the song \"pretty\" and \"catchy\". But he later criticized the lyrics, calling the song \"idiotic\", and giving a positive review to the acoustic version saying: \"it actually sounds more relaxed and engaging without the hoary loud guitars of the original\". Even though Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic marked the track as one of the \"All Media Guide track pick\" of the album, in a separate review, from the same website, the CD single release was rated with two-and-a-half out of five stars. Pareles noted that in verses of \"Ironic\", and another song from the album (\"Mary Jane\"), \"it's easy to envision Morissette on the stage of a club, singing wry couplets backed by acoustic guitar\". He also commented in another article he wrote, that the song was actually \"unironic\". Dave Brecheisen of \"PopMatters\" felt that the acoustic version of \"Ironic\", was much worse than the original version. The single won the Juno Award for Single of the Year at the 1997 ceremony, and in the same year it was nominated for a Grammy Award, in the category of Record of the Year.\n\nIn Canada, \"Ironic\" debuted on the \"RPM\" Singles Chart at number 95 on the issue dated January 8, 1996. Twelve weeks later the track topped the chart, on April 1, 1996, staying there for six weeks, being replaced by \"Closer to Free\" by American band BoDeans. Spending twenty-nine weeks within the top 100, it was last seen on July 22, 1996, at number 81. It spent 14 weeks in the Top 10 and was the number two song of 1996, behind Morissette's own \"You Learn\" at number one. On other \"RPM\" charts, the single topped the Alternative Rock Chart for a single week, spending 11 weeks in the Top 10, finishing 1996 as the number five song for the year on that chart. It reached number six on the Adult Contemporary Chart.\n\nIn the U.S., the track debuted at number 11 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, becoming the highest debut on the issue ending March 16, 1996. The single eventually reached its peak position, at number four, on April 13, 1996. \"Ironic\" is currently Morissette's highest-charting hit on the Hot 100 chart. On other US charts, the single became her third number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks, where it stayed for three weeks. The song topped the Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs) chart, reached number two on the Hot 100 Airplay chart (which includes both pop and rhythmic/crossover radio stations), reached number five on Adult Top 40 chart and peaked at number 28 of the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nIn Australia, the song debuted at number 40 on the ARIA Singles Chart. In its eighth week, it peaked at number three on May 12, 1996, where it stayed for two weeks. It was last appeared on the chart on July 21, 1996, at number 37. To date, \"Ironic\" is her best charting song on the country. In New Zealand, where the song was released as a double A-side with \"You Oughta Know\", it debuted at number 13 on April 21, 1996, peaked at number three on May 19, and made its last appearance on the chart at number 36 on June 30, staying at total of 11 weeks in the top 50. Like in Australia, \"Ironic\" became Morissette's highest-peaking single in New Zealand, but only at the time; \"Thank U\" and \"Hands Clean\" would chart higher in 1998 and 2002, respectively.\n\nThe song was generally well-received throughout Europe. In the United Kingdom \"Ironic\" debuted and peaked at number 11, on April 20, 1996. It left the chart eight weeks later, at number 67. In the Norwegian Singles Charts, it debuted at number 18, rising to number 17 the next week. It rose to number five on its third week, and later peaked at number four, staying there for five weeks. It later dropped one place, and remained there for another two weeks. \"Ironic\" kept within the chart for seventeen weeks. In Belgium, it reached sixth place on the Ultratop 50 (Flanders region), and ninth place on the Ultratop 50 (Wallonia zone).\n\nThe music video for \"Ironic\" was directed by Stéphane Sednaoui. In the beginning of the video, Morissette is at a gas station, walking to her automobile (1978 Lincoln Continental Mark V) with a cup of coffee in her hand. Then, she drives her car through a winter landscape, and she begins to sing the song's first verse. When it comes to the chorus, a second Morissette comes in. She is in a green sweater and sits in the backseat on the passenger side. When the first chorus ends, a third Morissette comes in, and she is in a yellow sweater with braided hair, also in the backseat, but on the driver's side. Along the way, the yellow Morissette is singing and eating at the same time, and when it comes to the second verse, a fourth and last Morissette comes in, she is in a red sweater sitting in the front passenger seat. During the second chorus, she climbs out of the window when they are still driving and almost gets knocked out by a bridge, but still manages a smile after doing so. The camera comes back to the driving Morissette, after the breakdown, and she takes off her hat, tosses it into the back seat, and becomes as loud as the other three while singing the song. When Morissette sings the outro, she is still driving through the winter landscape, and suddenly the car breaks down (possibly having run out of gas, which may be \"ironic\" in itself since the video started with her at a gas station). Morissette (as the driver) gets out of the car, and all her \"passengers\" have disappeared.\n\nBlaine Allan noted in the book \"Television: Critical Methods and Applications\" (2002) how Morissette interacts with the watcher. He commented that unlike Britney Spears' \"Lucky\" music video, where Spears plays dual role of a girl named \"Lucky\" and her fan, and both appear together in some scenes helped by visual effects, \"Ironic\" does not utilize them, using solely editing, giving the sense that all the Morissettes interact with each other. Journalist Carol Vernallis also found that Morissette's \"chitchat\" way of singing the song creates an intimate connection viewer. She mentioned the video in her book \"Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context\" (2004), where she studied how the audience may pay attention to the lyrics of the song in a music video. Vernallis added that \"Ironic\" music video functions as a limited example of how the meaning of a song's lyrics become \"inaccessible\" when they are videotaped and televised.\n\nCharles Aaron from \"Spin\" called \"Ironic\" music video \"neat\". The video was nominated for six MTV Video Music Awards in 1996: \"Video of the Year\", \"Best Direction in a Video\", \"Viewer's Choice\", \"Best Female Video\", \"Best New Artist in a Video\" and \"Best Editing\", winning the last three. It was nominated in 1997 for the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. Also, it was listed number eighteen at VH1's 100 Greatest Videos. In late 1996, a parody version of the video was released featuring a young girl, Alison Rheaume, who mimics Morissette's actions and wardrobe while lip syncing to the original song. At the end, her father notices her in the car sitting in the driveway and tells her to stop fooling around. This version of the video, directed by David Rheaume, was included on Morissette's CD/DVD \"\" (2005). \"Weird Al\" Yankovic produced a parody version of the video in 2003 for his television comedy series \"Al TV\", in which he takes the place of the fourth version of Morissette in the front passenger seat. Also in late 1996, Inglewood, CA rapper DBA Flip parodied the video for his single \"It's Friday Night (Just Got Paid)\". At the end of the video, Flip's car runs out of gas as he rolls up on an Alanis Morissette lookalike carrying a gas can and wearing one of the jackets from the \"You Learn\" video.\n\nThe single was added in the set list for Morissette's concert tour, Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995). The song was added to the tour's video album \"Jagged Little Pill Live\" (1997). Since then, \"Ironic\" has been included in her albums \"MTV Unplugged\" (1999), \"Feast on Scraps\" (2002), \"\" (2002), and \"The Collection\", as well as 1997 Grammys and the \"MTV Unplugged\" compilation albums.\n\nWith \"Ironic\", Morissette denoted her support for same-sex marriage. In March 2004, Morissette amended a lyric at the fifteenth annual GLAAD Media Awards: \"It's meeting the man of my dreams /And then meeting his beautiful husband\". She commented to \"USA Today\" that her support about same-sex unions \"goes a step further than clever lyrics.\" She remarked that \"[her] fantasy would now be to marry some of [her] gay couple friends.\" Later in June 2004, she said to VH1: \"I don't have any gay-couple friends who are formally engaged, but I would be honored to support the gay community in that way ... I did it as a sort of spontaneous thing at a radio station about a month ago with a couple, and my heart was so with them.\" Morissette recorded an acoustic version of the song with the changed lyric for her \"iTunes Originals\" release, in 2004. Another acoustic version was recorded for the album \"Jagged Little Pill Acoustic\", as well for the compilation album \"Cities 97 Sampler, Volume 16\" (2004). The song was also performed in a duo with Avril Lavigne at the House of Blues in 2005.\n\n\"Ironic\" was covered in 2007 by Mexican duet Jesse & Joy for their album \"Esta Es Mi Vida Sesiones\", and the pop punk band Four Year Strong for their 90's cover album \"Explains It All\" (2009). In the 1996 novel \"Naïve. Super\" by Norwegian author Erlend Loe, the protagonist watches the video for the song on television and dreams about \"meeting an Alanis-girl and living in a house together with her\". In the Jay and Silent Bob comic \"Chasing Dogma\" (1998), the character Tricia Jones is singing \"Ironic\" before Jay steps into the shower. In 2003, Ji-In Cho covered the song for the German version of the \"Fame Academy\" talent show, which became a success in the German charts. In September 2001, \"Ironic\" was listed as \"one of the songs deemed inappropriate due to its lyrics\" by American mass media company Clear Channel Communications, after the September 11 attacks occurred. The music of the song was featured in the romantic comedy film \"I Could Never Be Your Woman\" (2007), where Saoirse Ronan, as Izzie Mensforth, sings an altered version of the lyrics in a talent show. It also made a predominant appearance as the opener to 2013 comedy film \"The Internship\", starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, as they sing along to it. More recently, the song was briefly on an episode of \"Castle\" when the titular character laments about the song's title being subjected to misuse since it was first released. In 2015, Morissette appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden and sang a version of the song with new lyrics \"updated\" for the technology era, and an homage to the linguistics of the original mentioned above.\n\nCD single, cassette\nSpecial edition maxi single\nCredits adapted from \"Ironic\" CD single:\n\n\n"}

{"id": "2357314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2357314", "title": "Jamboree", "text": "Jamboree\n\nIn Scouting, a jamboree is a large gathering of Scouts who rally at a national or international level.\n\nThe 1st World Scout Jamboree was held in 1920, and was hosted by the United Kingdom. Since then, there have been twenty three World Scout Jamborees, hosted in various countries, generally every four years. The 24th World Jamboree is to be held in North America in 2019.\n\nThere are also national and continental jamborees held around the world with varying frequency. Many of these events will invite and attract Scouts from overseas.\n\nWith the birth of the Jamboree concept, other large gatherings are also organized by national Scout organizations, geared towards a particular group of Scouts. Examples of these large gatherings include: \n\nThe origin of the word \"Jamboree\" is not well understood. This is reflected in many dictionary entries. For example, according to the \"Canadian Oxford Dictionary\", the etymology is \"19th century, origin unknown\". The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) identifies it as coming from American slang, identifying a use in the New York Herald in 1868 and in Irish writings later in the 19th century. Within a half century, the meaning outside the Scouting program was becoming lost. For example,\nRobert Graves in \"The Crowning Privilege: The Clark Lectures, 1954–1955\" suggests Baden-Powell might have known the word through his regiment's Irish links rather than from the US slang. Poet Robert W. Service used the term well before the first Scouting jamboree. It appears in the poem \"Athabaska Dick\" in his \"Rhymes of a Rolling Stone\", which was published in 1912. By then, the word was becoming to mean a rowdy, boisterous gathering.\n\nBaden-Powell was once asked why he chose \"jamboree\". He replied, \"What else would you call it?\" His response made sense if the word had already had a specific meaning other than a boisterous gathering. It is popularly believed within the Scout Movement that the word was coined by Baden-Powell but it was never formally documented by either. \n\nThe word \"Jamboree\" today has several claimed possible origins, ranging from Hindi to Swahili to Native American dialects, which further confuses the meaning used by Baden-Powell.\n\nThe most logical use is that the name \"Jamboree\" is derived from the Swahili for hello, \"Jambo!\", as a result of the considerable amount of time he spent in the South African region in the 1880s then again in the late 1890s.\n\nThe word Jamboree is used in English, as a borrowed foreign word, with the ending -ree. The word Jamboree is a transitive verb with a direct action of the primary word Jambo. For example, an attendee of a Jambo is a Jamboree. The word \"Jamboree\" is used primarily by the Scouting program before the first Boy Scout \"Jamboree\" in 1920. The word has also come to mean \"a lavish or boisterous celebration or party\" outside of the Scouting program. Another example of a transitive word is \"transferee\" which the person receiving a transfer (money or goods) is the transfer-ree dropping the extra r. In contrast the person giving the transfer is the \"transferor.\" Such transitive words are still used in formal terms dealing in legal affairs. \n\nBaden-Powell deliberately chose the name \"Jamboree\" where attendees were warmly welcomed attending this first Boy Scout rally or meeting with the word \"Jambo!\" Many, at this first \"Jamboree\" or \"Scout gathering\" did not fully capture the spirit of this then-new concept or greeting. At the first \"World Jamboree\" at Olympia in 1920, Lord Baden-Powell said \"People give different meanings for this word, but from this year on, \"jamboree\" will take a specific meaning. It will be associated to the largest gathering of youth that ever took place.\"\n\nOlave, Lady Baden-Powell, coined the term \"jamborese\" to refer to the \"lingua franca\" used between Scouts of different languages and cultural habits, that develops when diverse Scouts meet, that fosters friendship and understanding between Scouts of the world. Sometimes the word jamborette is used to denote smaller, either local or international, gatherings.\n\nA similarly used word \"Camporee\" in the Scouting program is also reflective of the older English style of use. \"Camporee\" today reflects a local or regional gathering of Scouting units for a period of camping and common activities. Similar to a camporee, a jamboree occurs less often and draws units from the entire nation or world.\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "6421965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6421965", "title": "Lisle's Tennis Court", "text": "Lisle's Tennis Court\n\nLisle's Tennis Court was a building off Portugal Street in Lincoln's Inn Fields in London. Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse during two periods, 1661–1674 and 1695–1705. During the early period, the theatre was called Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, also known as The Duke's Playhouse, The New Theatre or The Opera. The building was demolished and replaced by a purpose-built theatre for a third period, 1714–1728. The tennis court theatre was the first public playhouse in London to feature the moveable scenery that would become a standard feature of Restoration theatres.\n\nThe period beginning in England in 1642 and lasting until 1660 is known as the Interregnum, meaning \"between kings.\" At this time, there was no monarch on the throne, and theatre was against the law. Spanning from 1642 to 1649, the English Civil War occurred. This war was an uprising against the current King of England, King Charles I, led by Oliver Cromwell, a Puritan. Cromwell's opposition to the throne was religious but political, as well, which led him to build up an army with the ability to imprison King Charles, who was beheaded in 1649, ending the war. After his death, the King's wife and children were given permission to leave the country, so they travelled to France to escape and receive protection. \n\nThe years following became known as the Commonwealth Era (1649-1660) because Cromwell, who established himself as the monarch figure without assuming any official authority, ruled the nation with Parliament support and renamed the England Republic to the English Commonwealth. These were tough times for England as Cromwell persecuted many families, especially those who fought on the behalf of King Charles I and Irish families that held rustic Catholic beliefs. Needless to say, Oliver Cromwell quickly fell out of the majority's favour, and he died in 1658 of natural causes. Two years later, Charles II, the beheaded king's son, returned to England and began the Restoration by restoring the throne and claiming his role as the proper King of England. \n\nIn addition, King Charles II's return restored the legality of theatre. This history is significant because it explains that since Charles II spent most of his life in France, he, as King, appreciated French culture, which prominently impressed upon England during the Restoration, particularly Restoration theatre.\n\nThere are no extant photos, elaborate diagrams, paintings, or other forms of visual evidence of the inside of the Lincoln's Inn theatre, but certain aspects are understood of the theatre according to its time period. However, a great example of the layout of the inside is the Theatre Royal in Richmond, England, which contains components of Restoration theatre spaces and still stands today. Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse was very small. In fact, Milhous believes that \"the smaller seating capacity… hurt the [Duke’s] company in the long run\" as they moved as newer theatres came along (Milhous 71). It was around 75 feet long by 30 feet wide with about a 650-person audience seating maximum capacity (The Restoration Theater; Wilson and Goldfarb 249). It was originally an indoor tennis court; courts were used as theatre spaces because they had a similar structure with a narrow, rectangular shape and gallery seating. The stage was raked, sloping upward toward the back of the stage, in order to help with perspective. The audience was divided into the pit, boxes, and galleries. The pit had backless benches and a raked floor that rose toward the back of the audience to help sightlines. Mostly single men sat here, and it was the noisiest, rowdiest area in the theatre. Boxes sat upper class aristocrats—mostly married couples with wives who wanted to be seen. Galleries held the lower class, including servants of the upper classes in attendance. \n\nThe English stage, unlike French or Italian theatres, had a very deep apron to provide adequate acting space, and the background and perspective scenery served as solely as scenery. The Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse orchestra was housed beneath the stage, and the apron was extended two feet to cover completely the orchestra pit and obtain close proximity between the actors and the audience, creating an intimate atmosphere. Another uniqueness of English theatres is that there were typically two pairs of doors, one on each side of the stage, called proscenium doors with balconies above them for the actors to utilize in performances. Proscenium doors served as entrances and exits disregarding the possibility of multiple locations. Candelabras provided light for the space, and manual moveable scenery was used to move the show along (The Restoration Theater).\n\nThe building was constructed as a real tennis court in 1656. Thomas Lisle's wife Anne Tyler and a man named James Hooker developed the indoor court in the winter of 1656 and 1657. Tudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions — about 75 by 30 feet — are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court.\n\nAfter the English Restoration in 1660, Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse received its first company through the efforts of the King himself and two men who dedicated themselves to theatre. Sir William Davenant had received a patent from Charles the I in 1639 when he was in power, but he had never used it due to the theatre ban. When theatre was restored, Davenant and a man named Thomas Killigrew wanted to create theatre in England and thus, Killigrew obtained a warrant expressing that he could \"raise a company and a theatre, provided that his company and Davenant’s should be the only ones allowed to play in London\" (Hotson 199). Davenant, then, drafted their joint warrant and after much debate over whether or not their role in theatre infringed on the Master of the Revels’ power, they appealed to Charles II. Charles II determined their Letters of Patent were valid and created two companies to perform \"legitimate drama\" in London: the Duke's Company of his brother, The Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and his company, the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Original intentions were positive, but competition was quickly apparent between the two. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and Salisbury Court), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Taking a hint from their new King's taste, Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres.\n\nIn March 1660, Sir William Davenant contracted to lease Lisle's Tennis Court in order to renovate it into a theatre, and he bought adjoining land to expand the building into the garden area. Killigrew's theatre on Vere Street (Gibbon's Tennis Court) opened first, in November 1660. Davenant apparently spent more time in his remodelling: Lincoln's Inn Fields opened on 28 June 1661, with the first \"moveable\" or \"changeable\" scenery used on the British public stage, and the first proscenium arch. Wings or shutters ran in grooves and could be smoothly and mechanically changed between or even within acts. The production was a revamped version of Davenant's own five-year-old opera \"The Siege of Rhodes\" where the soon-to-be famous actor, Thomas Betterton, performed the prologue. The result was such a sensation that it brought Charles II to a public theatre for the first time. This production at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse \"emptied Killigrew’s theatre\" according to Milhous (19). Milhous also explains that the companies and other theatres \"deliberately engaged in vicious head-on collision[s], mounting the same plays\" (19). The competing King's Company suddenly found itself playing to empty houses, as diarist and devoted playgoer Samuel Pepys notes on 4 July:\n\nI went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw \"Claracilla\" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.\n\n\"The Siege of Rhodes\" \"continued acting 12 days without interruption with great applause\" according to the prompter John Downes in his \"historical review of the stage\" \"Roscius Anglicanus\" (1708). This was a remarkable run for the limited potential audience of the time. More acclaimed productions by the Duke's Company \"with scenes\" followed at Lincoln's Inn Fields in the course of 1661 (including \"Hamlet\" and \"Twelfth Night\"), all highly admired by Pepys.\nThe King's Company was forced to abandon their own, technically unsophisticated tennis-court theatre and commission the construction of a new theatre in Bridges Street, where the Theatre Royal opened in 1663.\n\nPrince Cosimo III of Tuscany visited the Lisle theatre in 1669, and his official diarist left us this account:\n[The pit] is surrounded within by separate compartments in which there are several degrees [steps] of seating for the greater comfort of the ladies and gentlemen who, according to the liberal custom of the country, share the same boxes. Down below [in the pit] there remains a broad space for other members of the audience. The scenery is entirely changeable, with various transformations and lovely perspectives. Before the play begins, to render the waiting less annoying and inconvenient, there are very graceful instrumental pieces to be heard, with the result that many go early just to enjoy this part of the entertainment.\n\nThe theatre was implicated by the Grand Jury of Middlesex on 7 July 1703 for showcasing \"profane, irrelevant, lewd, indecent, and immoral expressions\". It was also a hot target for riots and disorderly assemblies, murders, and other misdemeanors, but despite its troubles, the theatre remained very popular including hosting the first paid performance of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas in 1700 and Handel's final two operas (Pedicord 41).\n\nDavenant died in 1668 and the Duke's Company, now under Thomas Betterton, performed out of Lincoln's Inns Fields until 1671, when they relocated to the elaborate new Dorset Garden Theatre which was more popular at the time. In 1672, the theatre in Bridges Street burnt down, and the King's Company temporarily occupied the recently vacated Lincoln's Inn Field, until their new theatre opened in 1674.\n\nThe building was converted back to a tennis court and remained one for almost 20 years. During that time, the Duke's Company, occupying the Dorset Theatre, subsumed the King's Company, housed in the newly rebuilt Theatre Royal, to form the United Company, performing out of Drury Lane. Betterton, a famous English actor, was forced out as the head of the company in 1688, staying on as an actor (and filling a day-to-day managerial role) while a succession of leaders embezzled funds and cut costs by cutting actors' salaries. This uniting created many conflicts between the members of the companies. For example, each company would have one actor who would always play Hamlet, but when the companies are combined, who claims the role? Due to rivalry and competition within the United Company, Thomas Betterton petitioned to the king to separate and create his own company. So, under Christopher Rich, the United Company split. Betterton left with a band of actors and a newly issued license to perform, and from 1695 to 1705 his company performed back at Lincoln's Inn Fields Playhouse, refurbishing the abandoned building back into a theatre. The New Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields opened in April 1695 with William Congreve's \"Love for Love\". It was later the first venue for Congreve's plays \"The Mourning Bride\" (1697) and \"The Way of the World\" (1700).\nThe building went unused as a theatre from 1705 until it was demolished in 1714 or shortly before, in preparation to build a new theatre. The man behind the new construction was none other than Christopher Rich, who after 16 years of management, had been pushed out of Drury lane. Rich died in 1714, but his son John Rich led a company at the theatre until 1728. On 29 January 1728, Rich's theatre hosted the first, very successful, production of John Gay's \"The Beggar's Opera\" (making \"Rich gay and Gay rich\"). The theatre was finally abandoned in December 1732, when the company moved to the new Covent Garden Theatre, built by Rich using the capital generated by \"The Beggar's Opera\".\n\nThe old building was used as a barracks, an auction room, a warehouse for china, and was finally demolished in 1848 to make room for an extension to the neighbouring premises of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n"}

On 16 December, 1931, 10-year-old Vera Page's body was found in undergrowth on Addison Road in Notting Hill, London. It was believed she had been murdered elsewhere and then transported to this location. Percy Orlando Rush was questioned about the murder but police were unable to discover enough evidence to charge him.\n\nVera Isobel Minnie Page was born on 13 April 1921 in Hammersmith, London, the only child born to Charles and Isabel Page.\n\nOn 14 December, 1931, Page left her home on Blenheim Crescent, Notting Hill, London at 4:30 p.m. to walk the 50 yards to where her aunt lived. When she had not returned home by 5:30 p.m., her father paid a visit to her aunt, who said she had left at around 4:45 p.m. A friend had seen Page outside a chemist's. Page's father then reported she was missing. Two days later, her body was found in the bushes by a house at Addison Road, Kensington, close to Holland Park, about a mile from her home; she had been raped and strangled.\n\nThe police thought she had been murdered elsewhere and later dragged into the undergrowth alongside the road. Her remains were examined by Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who discovered coal dust and candle wax on the girl's body, as well as a piece of ammonia-stained finger bandage lodged against her inner elbow, which had likely dislodged from the hand of her murderer as he deposited her body.\nThis coal dust, plus the candle wax discovered upon Page's clothing, led Spilsbury to the conclusion that the girl's body had been hidden in a coal cellar prior to her disposal at Addison Road, and that this cellar most likely had no electric light, as evidenced by the presence of candle wax also found upon the victim's clothing. One coal cellar close to Addison Road was found with its door ajar, and investigators theorised the girl's body had been hidden in this cellar after her murder.\n\nOver a thousand people were questioned about the murder of Vera Page, with one individual stating that during the very early morning of 15 December, she had seen a man fitting the description of one Percy Orlando Rush pushing a wheelbarrow covered with a red table-cloth in the direction of Addison Road. Rush quickly became the prime suspect. He was a forty-year-old married man, who worked as a flannel washer in a nearby launderette, and in this occupation he had regularly come into physical contact with ammonia. Furthermore, Rush had injured a finger on his left hand in his workplace less than a week prior to Page's murder, and freely admitted to having worn a finger bandage since this date. Unremarked upon at the February, 1932 inquest into Page's murder was the fact that Rush had been previously found guilty of exposing himself to girls.\n\nRush was never charged with the murder of Vera Page. No eyewitness accounts could place him with Page on the day of her death, and no chemist could recall having sold bandages to Rush. Though his movements were never verified, Rush claimed that on 14 December he had finished work and immediately travelled to Kensington. He died in 1961.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Serge Dorny was appointed general director in 2003.\n\nIn 1756, one of the first opera houses created inside an existing freestanding building was opened in Lyon. It was designed by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, the architect of the Panthéon in Paris. By early in the following century it was found to be too small, and Antoine-Marie Chenavard and Jean-Marie Pollet erected the new Lyon theatre which opened on July 1, 1831. It was considered rather undistinguished, but served its purpose.\n\nIt was not until 1985 that the City decided to once again re-build the opera house, but this time it was to be within the shell of the existing 1831 building. One of France's most distinguished architects was commissioned to create the house.\n\nThe style of the house is essentially Italian with a horseshoe-shaped auditorium and tiers of boxes. \n\nLeaving only the existing foyer and the exterior façade, Nouvel tripled the space within the house by excavating below ground to create rehearsal space and, most strikingly, by doubling the height of the building by creating a steel and glass barrel vault which hid the fly tower as well as providing space for the ballet company. It has been noted that this achievement was \"an architectural tour de force, in which the past has been successfully wedded to the future..\", albeit with the limited backstage space of the 19th-century theatre still remaining.\n\n\n\n"}

His one sentence pitch for the film was: \"An Indian princess falls in love with an English settler, then is torn between her father's wish to destroy the settlers and her need to help them.\" When Disney executives asked Gabriel to summarize Pocahontas' character, he replied: \"She's a girl with a problem.\" Inspired by William Shakespeare's play \"Romeo and Juliet\", the film's directors Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg wanted the story of \"Pocahontas\" to feature two characters of very different backgrounds falling in love. \n\nStory supervisor Tom Sito, who became the project's unofficial historical consultant, did extensive research into the early colonial era and the story of John Smith and Pocahontas, and was confronted over the historical inaccuracies from historians. Already knowing that in reality Pocahontas married John Rolfe, Gabriel explained it was felt that \"the story of Pocahontas and Rolfe was too complicated and violent for a youthful audience\" so instead, they would focus on Pocahontas's meeting with John Smith. While the real Pocahontas was a eleven or twelve years old upon meeting John Smith, she is depicted as being around eighteen or nineteen years of age in the film, according to her supervising animator Glen Keane. Keane explained that this change was made because a film wherein a thirty year-old Smith falls in love with a child would be \"sleazy\". Roy E. Disney felt that making the character older than the historical figure would make the film \"more dramatic\".\n\nDisney sought to consult Native American actors and a Native American organization in an attempt to accurately portray Indigenous culture onscreen. Elaine Dutka of the \"Los Angeles Times\" theorized that this decision was made due to the negative reception of \"Aladdin\" (1992) by the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee; Disney denied Dutka's theory. Native American activist Russell Means who plays Pocahontas' father Powhatan in the film, suggested that Pocahontas say she was \"honored\" by a gift Powhatan gives in a scene of the film to reflect the ways that Native Americans talked; Disney changed the film's script in accordance with Means' suggestion. Michael Eisner pushed for Pocahontas to have a mother, lamenting that \"We're always getting fried for having no mothers.\" The writers countered that Powhatan was polygamous and formed dynastic alliances among other neighboring tribes by impregnating a local women and giving away the child, so it was believed that Pocahontas herself probably did not see her mother that much. Storyboard artist Joe Grant would conceive the idea of the swirling leaves to represent Pocahontas's mother. Pocahontas became the first Native American Disney Princess and the first woman of color to be the lead character in a Disney film. As of 2014, she remains the only Disney Princess to be based on a historical figure.\n\nKeane also wanted Pocahontas to be written as a confident adult, unlike Ariel from \"The Little Mermaid\" (1989) or Belle from \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1991). The film's producer, Jim Pentacost, viewed the character as \"the strongest heroine we’ve ever had in a Disney film.\" Disney spokesman Howard Green said that the studio desired for the film to portray its Native American characters in a \"real\" and \"fair\" way, in contrast to the \"very comic, broad\" and inaccurate portrayal of Native Americans in \"Peter Pan\" (1953). Green also said that the studio did not want the film to reinforce stereotypes about indigenous peoples of North America. The film's crew met with Ray Adams, the chairman of the United Indians of Virginia, and showed him ten minutes of unfinished animation and the song \"Colors of the Wind\" to see if they had portrayed Pocahontas in a way which would not be offensive. Adams felt that the character's outfits were an accurate representation of Native American clothing and commented that Pocahontas was shown as \"very beautiful and very intelligent and very loving, which the Native Americans are. We usually aren't portrayed as being loving, but the settlers would not have survived the first three winters if we had not been loving and helped them.\"\n\nRenowned for animating female characters such as Ariel, supervising animator Glen Keane was immediately tapped to draw the titular Indian princess. Following the demands of Jeffrey Katzenberg to make the title character \"the most idealized and finest woman ever made\", Keane first began to sought his inspirations for his depictions for Pocahontas from Shirley 'Little Dove' Custalow-McGowan and Devi White Dove, women he had met during the research trip to Virginia. Keane recalled meeting the women:\n\nSo I turned around and there's this beautiful Indian woman walking up; a Native American. She said 'Are you Glen Keane? The animator that's going to do Pocahontas?' I said 'Well, yeah.' And then from behind another tree another woman came up and she said, 'Well, my name is Shirley Little Dove, and this is my sister Devi White Dove, and we are descended from Pocahontas.' And as they stood there, I mean I took a picture of both of them, and between their faces was Pocahontas' face in my mind – I could see her.\n\nOther inspirations were Christy Turlington, Natalie Belcon, Naomi Campbell, Jamie Pillow, white supermodel Kate Moss, Charmaine Craig, and Irene Bedard, who provided the character's speaking voice. Keane also looked to a 1620 depiction of Pocahontas from a history book, though Keane would state she was \"not exactly a candidate for \"People\"s 'Most Beautiful' issue [so] I made a few adjustments to add an Asian feeling to her face.\" Due to the complexity of the color schemes, shapes, and expressions in the animation, a total of 55 animators worked on the design of Pocahontas' character alone, including Mark Henn and Pres Romanillos. Filipina college student Dyna Taylor was paid $200 to model for the character. She was given an image of the character that Keane autographed with the words \"To Dyna, with gratitude for the inspiration you gave us.\" Disappointed that she was not credited in the film, Taylor considered suing Disney but was advised against doing so by a lawyer she consulted. Keane told \"The New York Times\" that he deemed Taylor's contributions to the film unworthy of a screen credit. Keane felt that the final version of the character was akin to a tribal version of Eve and less sexual and more athletic than earlier Disney character Jessica Rabbit.\n\nPocahontas has been identified as a feminist character who stands up against her father's patriarchal views in her refusal to marry the man her father wants her to marry. Megan Condis, assistant professor of English at Stephen F. Austin State University, has stated that compared to previous Disney Princesses \"Pocahontas was definitely a very different type of character in that she isn’t as defined by romantic relationships and she’s a lot more active. Also, she is one of the first princesses to actually take an active role in governing.\" Sophie Gilbert of \"The Atlantic\" opined that in creating the character \"Disney had, for the first time, provided an independent and fearless heroine with a strong sense of self.\" Gilbert noted that unlike Snow White or Cinderella, Pocahontas is able to find happiness outside of marriage. MTV's Lauren Vino noted that Pocahontas is not a damsel in distress, as she saves Smith's life rather than vice versa.\n\nUpon the twentieth anniversary of \"Pocahontas\", \"The A.V. Club\" Caroline Siede said that the film \"remains probably the most high profile story of a Native American in pop culture.\" Tom Brook of the BBC said that the character's portrayal was impacted by how \"[t]he rights of Native Americans were strengthened in the two decades from the mid-1970s by legislation protecting tribal rights and interests\".\n\nIn the beginning of the film, Pocahontas learns that Kocoum, one of her father's bravest warriors, has asked to marry her. (In place of a wedding ring, Pocahontas is given her deceased mother's wedding necklace, and she wears it throughout most of the film.) However, Pocahontas does not feel that this is the right path for her. She is the first one to spot the ship carrying the Europeans, mistaking the ship's sails for clouds. Pocahontas later encounters one of the settlers, John Smith. As the story unfolds, it is revealed that her mother has died and that she lives with her father.\n\nOver time, the two get to know each other, asking all sorts of questions about each other's people, lives, and different worlds. However, the conversation goes sour when John Smith unintentionally reveals his prejudices towards Native Americans. Pocahontas explains to him the beauty and importance of nature and respecting the earth through the song, \"Colors of the Wind\". This causes John to see the ill of his thoughts and change his ways, and the two fall in love with each other.\n\nWhen Kocoum stumbles upon Pocahontas and John Smith kissing, he becomes enraged and attacks the white man. Before Pocahontas can break them up, however, Thomas, who had been sent to find John, shoots and kills Kocoum. John Smith takes the blame for Kocoum's death, is taken prisoner by the Powhatan men, and sentenced to death at sunrise.\n\nPocahontas realizes that she must stop the execution that will lead to war between the Native Americans and the settlers. She runs to where it will take place, calling out to the forces of nature to help her reach them in time. Pocahontas reaches John Smith just in time to throw herself over him and save him from being killed by her father, Chief Powhatan, who then comes to his senses and releases Smith. When the enraged Governor Ratcliffe shoots at the chief, John Smith pushes Powhatan out of the way and takes the bullet.\n\nSoon after, a wounded John Smith asks her to come with him to England, but she explains that her place is in Virginia, with her people. To comfort him, she tells him that \"no matter what happens, I'll always be with you, forever\". They kiss, and the men carry him onto the ship. As it is leaving, Pocahontas runs as fast as she can to a cliff overlooking the ocean. John waves goodbye in the Powhatan fashion, and Pocahontas waves back in the Powhatan fashion, as she showed him earlier when the two first met.\n\nIn \"Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World\", Pocahontas goes to London as a diplomat to stop a potential attack upon her people being ordered by King James in a plot by Ratcliffe. There, she is accompanied by John Rolfe and slowly develops a romance with him. In the end, she is reunited with John Smith but explains to him that they are \"no longer following the same path that they went on years ago\", and parts ways with him. Successfully exposing Ratcliffe, who is then arrested by order of the King, Pocahontas and John Rolfe get on a ship going back to Virginia together, and kiss as the ship sails off into the sunset.\n\nShe is featured in Disney's Hollywood Studios nighttime fireworks stage show \"Fantasmic!\" and \"World of Color\" at Disney's California Adventure Park. She makes cameo appearances in numerous episodes of the \"Disney's House of Mouse\" television series. She appears daily at the Walt Disney Parks and Resorts for meet and greets. She is the most common \"Pocahontas\" character, next to Meeko. She and John Smith appear in the Disney Cruise Line stage show \"The Golden Mickeys\". She is also known to come out for meet-and-greets on the ships. Pocahontas, Meeko, and Flit make cameo appearances in the Hong Kong Disneyland version of It's a Small World. She had her own show entitled \"Pocahontas and her Forest Friends\" at Disney's Animal Kingdom, which ran from 1998 to 2008.\n\nPocahontas appears in several stories of \"Disney's 365 Bedtime Stories\".\n\nPocahontas, alongside other Disney Princesses, appeared in the film \"Ralph Breaks the Internet\", as was announced at the 2017 D23 Expo, with Bedard returning to voice her.\n\nLauren Vino of MTV considers Pocahontas to be the best of all the Disney Princesses. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" Peter Stack praised the romance between Pocahontas and Smith, writing that \"the film's isolation of the lovers -- their secret meetings near a stream, their tentative but enchanted glances, their first kiss -- is nothing short of captivating.\" Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated the character and John Smith are \"generic\". Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" dubbed her \"Poca-bore-me\" and bemoaned that she \"is so busy trying to teach John about protecting the spirit of the land, she hardly has time for romance.\"\n\n"}

In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Ben Chifley, Prime Minister of Australia (1945–1949), established the federal Department of Immigration to administer a large-scale immigration program. Chifley commissioned a report on the subject which found that Australia was in urgent need of a larger population for the purposes of defence and development and it recommended a 1% annual increase in population through increased immigration.\n\nThe first Minister for Immigration, Arthur Calwell, promoted mass immigration with the slogan \"populate or perish\". Calwell coined the term \"New Australians\" in an effort to supplant such terms as pommy (Englishman) and wog.\n\nThe 1% target remained a part of government policy until the Whitlam Government (1972–1975), when immigration numbers were substantially cut back, only to be restored by the Fraser Government (1975–1982).\n\nSome 4.2 million immigrants arrived between 1945 and 1985, about 40 per cent of whom came from Britain and Ireland. By 2007, some 6.5 million people have migrated to Australia since 1945. This total comprises 3.35 million males and 3.15 million females. This represents a significant proportion of the overall population increase experienced by Australia in that time, having gone from 7 million in 1945 to the present total of over 23 million. 182,159 people were sponsored by the International Refugee Organisation (IRO) from the end of World War II up to the end of 1954 to resettle in Australia from Europe—more than the number of convicts transported to Australia in the first 80 years after European settlement.\n\nFollowing the attacks on Darwin and the associated fear of Imperial Japanese invasion in World War II, the Chifley Government commissioned a report on the subject which found that Australia was in urgent need of a larger population for the purposes of defence and development and it recommended a 1% annual increase in population through increased immigration. In 1945, the government established the federal Department of Immigration to administer the new immigration program. The first Minister for Immigration was Arthur Calwell. An Assisted Passage Migration Scheme was also established in 1945 to encourage Britons to migrate to Australia. The government's objective was summarised in the slogan \"populate or perish\". Calwell stated in 1947, to critics of mass immigration from non-British Europe: \"We have 25 years at most to populate this country before the yellow races are down on us.\"\n\nThe post-war immigration program of the Chifley Government gave them preference to migrants from Great Britain, and initially an ambitious target was set of nine British out of ten immigrants. However, it was soon apparent that even with assisted passage the government target would be impossible to achieve given that Britain's shipping capacity was quite diminished from pre-war levels. As a consequence, Calwell looked further afield to maintain overall immigration numbers, and this meant relying on the IRO refugees from Eastern Europe, with the USA providing the necessary shipping. Many Eastern Europeans were refugees from the Red Army and thus mostly anti-Communist and so politically acceptable.\n\nThe 1% target survived a change of government in 1949, when the Menzies Government succeeded Chifley's. The new Minister of Immigration was Harold Holt (1949–56).\n\nThe British component remained the largest component of the migrant intake until 1953. Between 1953 and late 1956, migrants from Southern Europe outnumbered the British, and this caused some alarm in the Australian government, causing it to place restrictions on Southern Europeans sponsoring newcomers and to commence the \"Bring out a Briton\" campaign. With the increase in financial assistance to British settlers provided during the 1960s, the British component was able to return to the top position in the overall number of new settlers.\n\nHundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans migrated to Australia and over 1,000,000 Britons immigrated with financial assistance. The migration assistance scheme initially targeted citizens of Commonwealth countries; but it was gradually extended to other countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. The qualifications were straightforward: migrants needed to be in sound health and under the age of 45 years. There were initially no skill requirements, although under the White Australia policy, people from mixed-race backgrounds found it very difficult to take advantage of the scheme.\n\nMigration brought large numbers of southern and central Europeans to Australia for the first time. A 1958 government leaflet assured voters that unskilled non-British migrants were needed for \"labour on rugged projects ...work which is not generally acceptable to Australians or British workers.\" The Australian economy stood in sharp contrast to war-ravaged Europe, and newly arrived migrants found employment in a booming manufacturing industry and government assisted programmes such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme. This hydroelectricity and irrigation complex in south-east Australia consisted of sixteen major dams and seven power stations constructed between 1949 and 1974. It remains the largest engineering project undertaken in Australia. Necessitating the employment of 100,000 people from over 30 countries, to many it denotes the birth of multicultural Australia.\n\nIn 1955 the one-millionth post-war immigrant arrived in Australia. Australia's population reached 10 million in 1959, up from 7 million in 1945.\n\nIn 1972, Whitlam Government (1972-1975) adopted a completely non-discriminatory immigration policy, effectively putting an end to the White Australia policy. However, the change occurred in the context of a substantial reduction in the overall migrant intake. During the Fraser Government (1975-1982) there was a final end to the White Australia policy but there was an increasing intake of Vietnamese refugees in the aftermath of the end of the Vietnam War, and Australia experienced the largest intake of Asian immigrants since the arrival of the Chinese gold miners during the gold rush of the 1850s and 60s. In 1983, the level of British immigration was below the level of Asian immigration for the first time in Australian history.\n\nFinancial assistance was an important element of the post war immigration program and as such there were a number of agreements in place between the Australian government and various governments and international organisations.\n\n\nOn arrival in Australia, many migrants went to migrant reception and training centres where they learned some English while they looked for a job. The Department of Immigration was responsible for the camps and kept records on camp administration and residents. The migrant reception and training centres were also known as Commonwealth Immigration Camps, migrant hostels, immigration dependants' holding centres, migrant accommodation, or migrant workers' hostels.\n\nAustralia's first migrant reception centre opened at Bonegilla, Victoria near Wodonga in December 1947. When the camp closed in 1971, some 300,000 migrants had spent time there.\n\nBy 1951, the government had established three migrant reception centres for non-English speaking displaced persons from Europe, and twenty holding centres, principally to house non-working dependants, when the pressure of arrival numbers on the reception centres was too great to keep families together. The purpose of reception and training centres was to:\nprovide for general medical examination and x-ray of migrants, issue of necessary clothing, payment of social service benefits, interview to determine employment potential, instruction in English and the Australian way of life generally.\n\nThe centres were located throughout Australia (dates are those of post office opening and closing).\n\n\n\nOther hostels in New South Wales included Adamstown, Balgownie, Bankstown, Berkeley, Bunnerong, Burwood, Cabramatta, Cronulla, Dundas, East Hills, Ermington, Goulburn, Katoomba, Kingsgrove, Kyeemagh, Leeton, Lithgow, Mascot, Matraville, Mayfield, Meadowbank, Nelson Bay, North Head, Orange, Parkes, Port Stephens, Randwick, St Marys, Scheyville, Schofields, Unanderra, Villawood, Wallerawang and Wallgrove.\n\n\n\n\nSince 1950 Australia has experienced average arrivals of around one million per decade, with the totals in the earlier decades being slightly above the totals in the more recent decades. Current statistics suggest that one million will be reached again in the current decade. The breakdown by decade is as follows:\n\n\nThe highest number of arrivals in any one year since World War II was 185,099 in 1969-70 and the lowest was 52,752 in 1975-76.\n\nIn the 2006 census, birthplace was enumerated as was date of arrival in Australia for those not born in Australia. For the major immigrant groups enlarged by the arrival of immigrants to Australia after World War II, they are still major demographic groups in Australia:\n\nNot all of those enumerated would have arrived as post-war migrants, specific statistics as at 2006 are not available.\n\n\n"}

International controversy regarding the case developed when attorneys for the boys attempted to have her held in contempt, but the motion was subsequently dropped.\n\nAfterwards, at the time of sentencing, the judge said that because of the \"serious nature\" of the crime, she would revise the punishment requested by the prosecutor.

Then Judge McDonald took an extra step, indicating that the crime itself should not be discussed and that no one should \"speak about the incident to anyone for any reason,\" she said, according to court files. \"No one is to talk or type anything.\" This meant that Dietrich (the 16-year-old female victim) was not permitted to speak about the case, the charges, the facts and allegations therein, and the identities of the defendants.\n\nDietrich stated that she felt her concerns were not properly addressed and that the proposed deal was too lenient. Later that evening, she announced the names of the defendants on Twitter, tweeting \"Will Frey and Austin Zehnder sexually assaulted me,\" and \"There you go, lock me up. I'm not protecting anyone that made my life a living hell.\"\n\nThe primary judge on the case, Angela McCormick Bisig, was away the day the controversial order of silence was issued by Judge McDonald. In 2013 Judge Bisig, then a circuit-court judge, went on record acknowledging Dietrich should have been allowed to discuss the crime itself, \"We cannot tell a young crime victim that they cannot tell their personal story.\"\n\nAttorneys for the boys attempted to have Dietrich held in contempt for publishing their names, but the motion was subsequently dropped. Notwithstanding Judge McDonald's admonitions forbidding anyone \"talk or type anything\", on August 28, 2012 Judge Bisig stated in her ruling that on July 30, 2012 \"Judge McDonald ruled that there was no \"gag order\" in place and that her admonishment had been to comply with the law of confidentiality required by Kentucky Statutes.\"\n\nIn an affidavit, Dietrich also stated that Paul Richwalsky, the chief prosecutor in the juvenile court division, said she should \"get over it and see a therapist. ... The jail was for 'real' rapists, murderers and robbers\". Richwalsky denied the allegation and stated in an affidavit \"Perhaps it is not so much she is trying to intentionally mislead and deceive this court, but rather the delusional assertions made in her affidavit are merely the byproduct of what she would like to believe happened and not what in actuality took place.\"\n\nDuring sentencing, Judge Angela Bisig emphasized the \"serious nature\" of the crime. She removed a provision of the plea deal that would have expunged the defendants' records when they reach age of . She also ordered that their community service be served at a charity that deals with women's issues.\n\nTerms of the sentences require supervision by the state's juvenile justice department, offender treatment and performance of 50 hours of community service at a women's facility. After three years of good behavior the two felony charges may be amended down to misdemeanors and after five years the boys may request that the convictions be expunged.\n\nDietrich was reportedly satisfied with the revised punishment. In March 2013, she took an active and public role in advocating legislation in the Kentucky legislature, as reported by \"The Courier-Journal\":\n[S]he hopes that a law would prevent what happened to her from happening to anyone else. She said perhaps the law will make it clear to everyone that it is the victim's right to talk about what happened.\nAt the same time, Dietrich indicated that such a state law is not absolutely necessary, given the protections that she believes are already afforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. First Amendment expert Eugene Volokh has commented about this Louisville case, saying that a pertinent U.S. Supreme Court precedent on this subject is Oklahoma Publishing v. District Court, 430 U.S. 308 (1977). \"An order barring a victim from revealing the names of her assailants is, I think, clearly unconstitutional, even when the assailants are juveniles. Oklahoma Publishing Co. v. District Court (1977) expressly rejected the notion that courts or legislatures may bar the publication of the names of juvenile offenders; that case involved a newspaper's publishing the name of the juvenile offender, which it learned from a court hearing, but the rationale applies at least as strongly to a person's publishing a name that she learned from the attack itself.\"\n\n"}

The initiator and main organizer was Ivo Bogdan and chief editor was Tias Mortigjija (until 1944). In addition with Mortigjija and Bogdan, in magazine regularly publish articles on politics; Milivoj Magdić, Savić Štedimlija and Ante Ciliga (since 1943).

The power unit, most often, but not exclusively two stroke 250 cc engines, can be specially designed kart engines or production motorcycle engines with either five or six-speed sequential gearboxes. Owing to their high top speed and superb cornering ability, a Superkart's aerodynamic bodywork includes a front fairing, larger sidepods, and a rear wing. They use either tires and wheels and most often race on full size auto-racing circuits.\n\n250 cc Superkarts often set faster lap times than much more expensive and technically advanced racing machines. Some British and Australian classes also include 125 cc gearbox karts.\n\nSuperkarts race on \"long circuits\" (e.g. Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Magny-Cours). In the UK they also race on \"short circuits\" (e.g. Kimbolton), \"short circuits\" are under 1,500 metres in length.\n\nSuperkarts are raced worldwide. There is a multi-event CIK-FIA European Superkart Championship (for 250 cc karts only), and there has in the past been a World Championship, which was last run in 1995.\n\nPowered by a 2-stroke 250 cc engine producing 62 hp for an overall weight including the driver of 205 kilograms, Superkarts have a power/weight ratio of 440 hp/tonne (330 W/kg)(c.5 lbs/hp). Superkarts can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in less than 3 seconds with a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). Their low weight and good downforce make for excellent cornering and braking abilities. A Superkart is capable of braking from 100 mph (160 km/h) to standstill in around 2 seconds, and taking corners at nearly 3 \"\"g\"\" (30 m/s²).\n\nAt some circuits, Superkarts are the outright lap-record holders, at others they run at around Formula 3 lap times.\n\nBritish Superkart Divisions :\n\n\nAustralian Superkart Classes:\nSuperkarting in Australia has, since 1989, referred to any form of racing kart to race on full-size motor racing circuits, usually as sanctioned by the Australian ASN, CAMS.\n\nUnited States Superkart Classes:\n\n\n\"Road & Track\" reports Supercart to cost between $15,000 to $20,000 USD in 2005. Entries of 60 or more are common in Britain. Overtaking tends to be easy, as there is room to get past, so the races tend to be full of action. Race lengths tend to be around 20–25 miles (30–40 km), because the fuel tanks are quite small, so at most meetings which feature Superkarts, the karts race is often a brief, spectacular highlight (U.S. Superkart races are a timed 30-minute race; Pre-Final on Saturday, Final on Sunday).\n\nA global category, Superkarts are endorsed by the FIA, and were featured as a support category to the French Formula 1 Grand Prix at Magny-Cours in 2007 where they bettered Porsche Supercup lap times.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "24924301", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24924301", "title": "Tornrak", "text": "Tornrak\n\nTornrak is the third opera by Welsh composer John Metcalf. It has an English-language libretto by Michael Wilcox with Inuktitut sections translated by Blendina Makkik. Set between the worlds of the Canadian Arctic and Victorian Britain, it features Inuit throat singing and other extended vocal techniques that give the Arctic scenes a distinct character. The opera was composed between 1986 and 1990 when Metcalf was working in Canada. It was first staged in 1990 in a co-production by the Banff Centre, where Metcalf worked, and the Welsh National Opera who had commissioned the work.\n\nAlthough Welsh National Opera (WNO) had first discussed with Metcalf the possibility of his writing a second opera, after \"The Journey\", for them in 1981, it was not until 1986 that Brian McMaster, the company's then managing director, first brought the composer and librettist together. After Wilcox had initially started work on another idea, Metcalf contacted him about the true story of a 19th-century Inuit girl, Milak, who rescued a British sailor, Arthur. Like the character in the opera, the true Milak was shown as a circus freak; unlike her, she returned home. \n\nThe development of \"Tornrak\" was greatly influenced by Metcalf's move to Canada later in 1986 to teach on the Music Theatre course at the Banff Centre in Alberta. He subsequently became Artistic Director of the programme and Composer-in-Residence. Wilcox visited Metcalf in Canada that winter to work on the first draft of the libretto and used the library facilities there to learn about Inuit traditions and mythology. Metcalf too found that the setting enabled him to portray their subject in a more genuine manner. \"If I wasn't in the North itself, at least I could now be in contact with a way of looking at the world, the culture, the music, and the language of the Inuit that would have been absolutely impossible in Wales.\"\n\nFrom 1988 onwards, Metcalf tried out sections of the developing opera in workshops at Banff. Such support for new compositions were an important facet of the programme there. He also had ready access to experienced colleagues such as Keith Turnbull, the Assistant Director on the course, and Richard E. Armstrong who had worked with Roy Hart. Just as Peter Maxwell Davies had composed \"Eight Songs for a Mad King\" with Hart's unusual voice and extended vocal techniques in mind, so Metcalf was able to compose \"Tornrak\" knowing that Armstrong would participate in the opera and also coach the other performers. Armstrong's repertoire of unusual sounds were used in the writing for the spirits and animals. The Inuit parts also required techniques new to Western singers. Fides Krucker, who played the part of Milak in Banff, visited Iqaluit in 1989 and 1990. There she learnt the Inuit throat singing techniques which she used in her performances and on which she advised Metcalf.\n\nWilcox encouraged Metcalf to make any changes to the libretto that he needed. He himself revisited Banff again to update the text. Even when he was in Britain, he would respond to urgent phone calls to make changes during the workshops. One of the most significant of the changes to the libretto was the decision to translate much of the first act from English into Inuktitut. Differences in stress patterns between the two languages meant that Metcalf recomposed vocal lines, moving material initially intended to be sung into the orchestral parts.\n\nMeanwhile, WNO had agreed to a change in the scale of \"Tornrak\". Instead of it being a chamber opera using just ten singers to be performed in small venues in Wales, it would now use a larger cast including a chorus and be staged in the large venues normally used by the full company. While those who were involved in the project were sure that the final work was stronger than it would have otherwise been, the many changes resulted in severe delays to the opera's completion and led to repeated postponements of the first performance.\n\n\"Tornrak\" was given a \"World Preview Performance\", without a chorus, in workshops in Banff on 23 February 1990. This was a co-production with Welsh National Opera with scenery, props and costumes being shared. The first performance by WNO was on 19 May 1990 at the New Theatre, Cardiff, two years later than originally planned. This first Welsh performance, with chorus, is often listed as the official première. A second performance in Cardiff later that month was broadcast on BBC Radio 3. The production was toured to six English cities during June and July.\n\nFides Krucker, the original Milak, kept the role in her repertoire performing extracts, for example at the Royal Ontario Museum in 1994\n\n\"Tornrak\" is scored for strings, flute, piccolo, oboe, (doubling cor anglais,) 2 clarinets, (doubling E flat clarinets,) bassoon (doubling contra bassoon,) 2 horns, trumpet, trombone, tuba, piano, vibraphone and separate percussionist. The first act is based on an ascending scale running from C through F to C again using the five black notes; the second act uses a descending scale, again based on C but this time using all white notes taken from the major scale with the exception of the sharpened F (eleventh harmonic).\n\nWhile the opera is representative of the composer's early musical style, it also advances it. The music is multi-layered and rhythmically complex, much of it using middle colours including woodwind and tuned percussion. In Metcalf's first opera, \"The Journey\", solo instruments, usually high pitched, reacted to the voices; \"Tornrak\" makes only occasional use of solo violin or the upper registers of the piano. Extreme colours and registers serve to increase the contrasts already present in earlier works.\n\nOn the non-musical level, too, \"Tornrak\" develops ideas seen in the composer's earlier works. Metcalf's sometime collaborator, the writer Mark Morris, notes that Metcalf's first two operas and his cantata \"The Boundaries of Time\" had already considered such themes as the clash of cultures, the alienation of individuals from their surroundings, the attempts of humanity to communicate with Nature and the displacement of individuals from their homelands. These all appear in his third opera. \"Tornrak\" presents the theme of clashing cultures most strongly in two crowd scenes musically distinct from the balance of the score: in the fair and court scenes, the music is vertical, reflecting the clash in values between those present, whereas in most of the opera each layer has its own momentum and the music develops horizontally, representing individual destinies that largely develop autonomously.\n\nThe score is remarkable for its incorporation of Inuit throat singing and other extended vocal techniques, establishing distinct sound worlds for the scenes set in the Arctic and those set in Victorian Britain. Indigenous singers took part in the workshops in Banff and also travelled to Wales to train the WNO cast. Although it is not uncommon for opera to mix different national music styles when portraying clashes between cultures, \"Tornrak\" stands out because both Inuit music and its singing techniques are foreign to the Western musical tradition.\n\nThe North American performances won the 1991 National Opera Association Award and the Best New Opera award from Opera America. The production team, led by Mike Ashman, won praise for its creativity with the limited resources available.\n\nReviewing the Welsh premiere, Rodney Milnes described \"Tornrak\" as \"[a]n absorbing, thought-provoking and very approachable new opera\" and as more successful than Metcalf's first opera \"The Journey\". Milnes particularly praises the economy of writing in both the libretto and the score. Hugh Canning wrote of \"a new opera which works on its own terms\". Both these critics felt that the arctic scenes were the more successful. Paul Griffiths was more reserved about the \"pleasant, straightforward fable\", finding the vocal lines uninteresting except for the throat-singing but being happier with the orchestral sound.\n\n1850, a British naval survey ship, the \"Endeavour\", is in the Canadian Arctic. After being told by the Mate that Arthur Nesbit, a sailor from North Shields, has been behaving in a disruptive manner, the Captain asks him to explain his conduct. The rest of Act I and most of Act II is told in flashback.\n\n1845, the \"Enterprise\", a sister ship of \"Endeavour\", has foundered in the Arctic. Arthur and three others escape into the ice. One of them, Kellett, kills Collinson, a young officer, after they argue over some valuables. Kellett and the last sailor Billy escape without Arthur who is saved from starvation only when he sees a polar bear taking meat from its hidden store. Arthur dreams of returning home and of the rich life he would afford with the valuables. An apparition warns him that he needs to survive first.\n\nMilak, a young Inuk, arrives led by her \"tornrak\", or spirit guide, that takes the form of an owl. She knows of the bear's meat cache and intends to raid it. The \"tornrak\" abandons her when she notices signs of Arthur's presence. Milak wonders whether it has led her into a trap. Arthur, in turn, thinks she has come to steal from him. \n\nThe bear returns and the two humans fight it. The spirits of Inuit hunters sing that the bear's time has come and Arthur strikes the killing blow. Milak throat-sings with the dying animal and frees its \"tornrak\" by skinning it. She gives Arthur the pelt. She leads him towards her village which has been devastated by disease caught from the British. On the way she persuades him to leave behind the valuables that have been slowing him down, but she decides to keep the \"Great White Bird flying with many wings\", a ship in a bottle that reminds her of her \"tornrak\".\n\nWhen they return to the village, only Milak's father Utak is still alive. Expecting death, he tears off his clothing and calls his \"tornrak\". It kills him as payment for all the help it has given him since childhood, leaving his bones unburied and his spirit to wander.\n\nDuring the Winter, Arthur and Milak learn bits of each other's languages. In the Spring, they are discovered by a British ship which has come to trade with the village. The explorer Sir Charles Keighley decides to take Milak to Britain to help with his research. She agrees because she thinks the ship is her \"tornrak\".\n\nSir Charles has given the last of his lectures on the Arctic and is thanked by Lady Delisle at her home. Now he has finished with Milak, he tells Arthur to look after her.\n\nArthur and Milak, \"The Wild Savage of the Frozen North\", join a travelling fair in Wales where she is shown to members of the public in a cage. The spectators find her performance frightening. Another member of the fair, a bearkeeper, tries to rape her. Although she escapes him, she is locked in her cage. She persuades the bear to break open the cage and then escape. The crowd are frightened by it and a constable shoots it despite the bearkeeper's pleas. Both he and Arthur find themselves without exhibits.\n\nMilak survives in the country by catching animals such as rabbits and sheep. A molecatcher warns her that she could be hanged for theft. She moves to an industrial town where she becomes a prostitute. She meets Arthur again who tries to persuade her to return to the Arctic but she thinks this is now impossible as she has become Westernised and cut off from Nature. The two are recognised by the bearkeeper who has Milak arrested as the wild woman who has been reported to be stealing sheep. The Judge sentences her to hang despite protests from Arthur and the spectators that she had no other option.\n\nBack on the \"Endeavour\", Arthur has finished his narration. The Captain leaves him in charge of the helm. Arthur tears off his clothes and calls to Milak's spirit in the hope that the ship will be sunk and the Inuit protected from the dangers its crew bring. In a squall, Milak's \"tornrak\" arrives, once more in the form of an owl. \n\nArthur is found dead and frozen to the wheel. Only the Mate is willing to obey the Captain and remove the body. When he throws the corpse overboard, the squall stops and the ship is suddenly becalmed. There is no reading on the compass.\n"}

Alan Ladd was announced as star.\n\nIn March 1944 it was announced Ladd would be re-inducted into the army but that this would be delayed so he could make \"Mast\".\n\nBrian Donlevy was originally going to play the sadistic captain but was given the role of Dana instead. Howard da Silva, who had just achieved fame playing Judd in \"Oklahoma!\" on Broadway, played the captain.\n\nMexican film star Esther Fernandez had been signed to Paramount for two years without making a film. John Farrow watched some test footage she made and was impressed; she was brought back to play the female lead.\n\nDue to war time restrictions - notably lack of transport - Paramount had endured many logistical difficulties filming the pirate movie \"Frenchman's Creek\" on location. This prompted them to decide to shoot \"Two Years Before the Mast\" entirely within the confines of the studio. Seascapes and soundscapes from Paramount's \"Souls at Sea\" (1937) were re-used.\n\nThe film heavily dramatised the novel but attempted to be faithful. \"Dana's tale is so well known that we shall have to stay close to the line of his yarn,\" said John Farrow, \"Especially in the characters.\" Extensive research was done on the project for six months prior to shooting.\n\nFilming began in May 1944 and took 69 days. \"We could do it in less but we've got to allow stubble to grow,\" said Farrow. \"Chins have got to grow over with gray plush. May cost a hundred thousand. Depends on how long it takes those chins to sprout. But meantime, we can be shooting storms and Miss Fernandez.\"\n\nAlan Ladd injured his back during filming and had to miss a week of shooting.\n\nThe movie was shot on three studio sound stages. Four stage were combined into one, for the interiors. There was another stage holding the water tank. Two models of the ship were built at a total cost of $150,000.\n\nParamount were so pleased with Da Silva's performance they signed him to a seven-year contract. Darryl Hickman, who played the cabin boy, also impressed and was signed to a long term contact.\n\nThe film was not released until late 1946, after the release of several films Ladd made subsequent to \"Mast\": \"Salty O'Rourke\", \"The Blue Dahlia\" and \"O.S.S.\". This also meant that Barry Fitzgerald, who became a star in \"Going My Way\" (1944) while the film was waiting for release, was upped to above the title billing.\n\n\"Two Years Before the Mast\" was one of the most popular films released in the US that year, \"Los Angeles Times\" describing it as \"a phenomenal hit\". \"Variety\" listed it as the tenth most popular movie of 1946.\n\n"}

The company is a residency program for aspiring opera professionals, with its major production being a summer opera festival.\n\nThe company's mission is to discover and develop talent in the opera field and to serve young singers by giving them training and performance experience with opera productions, concerts and recitals each summer at the Filene Center and The Barns at Wolf Trap. Productions also feature the work of rising directors, conductors, designers, coaches, stage managers, scenic artists, and technicians.\n\nThe Company provides performance and career development opportunities for two tiers of emerging professional singers. Filene Young Artists have typically recently finished academic study and apprentice training and are about to enter the full-time professional stage of their careers. They sing all featured and supporting roles in WTOC productions and are featured in concert and recital. Notable Filene Young Artists include Lisa Hopkins Seegmiller, John Holiday and Craig Colclough.\n\nStudio Artists are either about to finish their undergraduate study or have just begun work on a graduate degree. They sing ensemble and small roles in WTOC productions and present a staged scenes program.\n\nFrom a pool of over 1,000 singers, typically 400-500 are chosen to audition. From that group 15-20 are selected as Filene Young Artists and 12-16 are selected as Studio Artists.\n\nThe company typically presents three operas at the Filene Center and/or The Barns at Wolf Trap. In addition, recitals and other performances take place. In 2010 the company presented \"Zaide\", \"Il Turco in Italia\", and \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\". The 2012 season included Igor Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\" at The Barns. The 2013 season opened with Gioachino Rossini's \"Il viaggio a Reims\", followed by Giuseppe Verdi's \"La traviata\" and \"Falstaff\".\n\nOver 90% of recent Filene Young Artists are working as professional singers. Among notable alumni are Stephanie Blythe (1995 and 1996), Lawrence Brownlee (2001), Elizabeth Futral (1991), Denyce Graves (1989), Christine Goerke (1995), Nathan Gunn (1994 and 1995), Beverly Hoch (1980), Lisa Hopkins (2007), Michael Maniaci (2002), Simon O'Neill (2003), Dawn Upshaw (1985), Jennifer Larmore (1983), Mark Delavan (1988), Paul Austin Kelly (1987), James Maddalena (1975, 1976, and 1977), Mary Dunleavy (1993 and 1994), Robert Orth (1975, 1976, and 1979), Rockwell Blake (1974 and 1976), Richard Croft (1985), and Anna Christy (2000 and 2001).\n\nIn December 2009, the Company's 2007 live recording of John Musto's \"Volpone\" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Opera Recording.\n\n\n"}

It is broadcast by Rai 1.\n\nIt was started by Cino Tortorella, and the first two festivals were held in Milan. In 1961, the festival was taken up by the Antoniano Institute and moved to Bologna. In 2009, Cino Tortorella left Zecchino d'Oro.\nIn 1963, Mariele Ventre, a conductor and director of young performers, created the Piccolo Coro dell'Antoniano Children's Choir (called Piccolo Coro \"Mariele Ventre\" dell'Antoniano after her death in 1995, and directed by Sabrina Simoni).\nFrom 1976 the festival took on an international perspective - each year seven Italian songs and seven foreign songs are sung by children and voted for by a children's jury. The winning song is rewarded with the Zecchino d'Oro award.\n\nAs has been regularly stated during the event, the winners of the Zecchino d'Oro and Zecchino d'Argento are the writers and composers of the songs, not the children who interpret them. This rule applies to all editions.\n\nYounger songwriters are Yumiko Ashikawa (芦川祐美子, 7, who also has sung her song), Miruna Codruța Oprea (13), Ioachim Octavian Petre (13) and Lara Polli (13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
