The National Children's Home charity invited him to the Women of Influence Awards at the Barony Halls. Celebrity magazine \"No1\" carried a picture of him which was captioned \"Lady Shona [McLaughlan] and Sir Alan McIlwraith\", showing him wearing the dress uniform of the Parachute Regiment with medals.\n\nMcilwraith created a Wikipedia article about himself on 5 October 2005, which read as follows:\n\nMcilwraith also uploaded to Wikipedia a photograph of himself wearing military uniform and medals. The article was created from an IP address registered to AOL, but Mcilwraith also apparently edited the article under the Wikipedia username MilitaryPro. On 10 October 2005 the article was tagged as needing citations for , and on 20 October 2005 the article was tagged for due to concerns about its reliability. The article was deleted three times and protected from recreation on 17 February 2006. When news of the hoax broke in April 2006 the article was revived, stating that the previous versions had been written by Mcilwraith himself.\n\nWhen the article was created, Mcilwraith was described as a CBE, but by December 2005 he had purportedly been elevated to the rank of KBE. On 4 October 2005, MilitaryPro added the name of Alan Mcilwraith to the List of honorary British Knights in Wikipedia.\n\nMcilwraith's double life was exposed by the Scottish tabloid newspaper the \"Daily Record\" in an article on 11 April 2006 which described him as \"Sir Walter Mitty\". The newspaper contacted the British Army and Buckingham Palace during its investigation into Mcilwraith's status, but both denied knowledge of him. An Army spokesperson was quoted by the newspaper as saying, \"I can confirm he is a fraud. He has never been an officer, soldier or Army cadet. May I suggest you try the space cadet organisation.\" \n\nIn December 2007, the \"Sunday Mail\" reported that Mcilwraith had reinvented himself as a magician called Ledger, and claimed to be a drinking companion of Lance Burton. A spokesman for Burton (who is teetotal) dismissed the report. Mcilwraith also claimed to have come second in the World Magician of the Year contest.\n\nMcilwraith also boasted that he used magic to bed numerous women. He said: \"I must admit, magic does help attract the ladies. Women really love my magic – but when guys see them crowding round, they want to get in on the act too and muscle them out of the way. Women like any tricks to do with money. I have one where I put a pen through a note but leave it intact and they go mad for it. But I have a strict rule for women – if one asks you back to hers after midnight, always say no – you'll be too drunk and she'll turn out to be a minger.\"\n\nWhen confronted by the \"Sunday Mail\", he said: \"I've been very stupid. It was all lies and for that I apologise. I should have stopped lying after I got caught last time but I just really wanted to be taken seriously as a magician. I won't ever do this again.\"\n\nIn June 2009, Mcilwraith received fresh coverage in the \"Daily Record\", which reported that he had been passing himself off as a millionaire property tycoon and charity worker to students at Strathclyde University. The paper also claimed that Mcilwraith had asked some students for disclosure documents and taken their National Insurance numbers and other details after duping them into filling in recruitment forms.\n\nWhen a journalist from the \"Record\" met Mcilwraith at Glasgow Central Station, he was wearing \"striking blue\" contact lenses. Mcilwraith claimed he was working for an agency that housed asylum seekers, denied passing himself off as a student and said that the stories of his latest tall tales had come from students getting confused after too many drinks. He stated: \"I have been trying to recruit people for the company I work for but I have not been trying to do anything other than help. It's true I asked one girl about getting a disclosure but I was genuinely trying to help her along too.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2829151", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2829151", "title": "Animal Precinct", "text": "Animal Precinct\n\nAnimal Precinct is an American documentary reality television series that originally aired from June 26, 2001, to February 4, 2008, on Animal Planet. Set in New York City, the series follows the animal cruelty agents of the ASPCA's Humane Law Enforcement Division as they work as advocates for the five million pets and other animals in New York City, sometimes removing them from dangerous situations and pursuing arrests of those who have been accused of being cruel to animals.\n\nThe show was filmed locally by crews from Anglia Television, edited in the UK and shown on Discovery Channel networks worldwide.\n\nWhen the series debuted in 2001, episodes were 30 minutes in length. This was later extended to a full hour, and remained there for all subsequent seasons. The pilot episode was quite different from subsequent episodes, as it focused primarily on Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas and included her discussing various parts of her job, such as how she felt about carrying a gun.\n\nOn October 12, 2001, Animal Planet aired a one-hour special focused on the work to rescue the many animals that were affected by the fall of the World Trade Center towers on September 11.\n\nThe ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement (HLE) officers can be classified as Special Agents or Special Investigators. Many HLE officers are identified by name on-camera; however, some are not, instead spoken of only by initial (most notably \"Special Agent M\" and \"Special Agent Q\") with their faces blurred when on-camera as a way to protect their identities so that they can do undercover work for the ASPCA.\n\nDuring the first three seasons, the HLE team had ten investigators. At the start of the fourth season, the team had been expanded to fifteen investigators. In season six, the team expanded again, and as of May 2008, the HLE has twenty investigators, including a female undercover agent (\"Special Agent L\").\n\nIn 2007, Special Investigator Annemarie Lucas was promoted to Supervisory Special Investigator. As a result of the extra duties associated with her promotion, she does fewer street work cases, but still occasionally participates in investigations when other agents need her assistance.\n\n\nSpecial Agent Henry Ruiz was known as \"Special Agent H\" during the show's early seasons but revealed his true identity in the episode aired on July 18, 2005, after he ceased performing undercover work. Ruiz's \"unmasking\" was the subject of a series of special episodes of \"Animal Precinct\", in which footage of Ruiz's past rescues was shown for the first time without the facial blurring, as well as footage from his last major undercover operation for the ASPCA (reconnaissance and surveillance of an area holding roosters bred for cock fighting) with Ruiz demonstrating and explaining his undercover techniques on-camera. However, completed episodes filmed while Ruiz was still \"Special Agent H\" still have his face blurred whenever he appears on-screen.\n\nIn 2014, Special Investigator Diane DiGiacomo was diagnosed with cancer that was directly attributed to her exposure to toxins while working as a part of animal search and rescue operations after the September 11 attacks that were depicted in the \"Animal Precinct at Ground Zero\" special. DiGiacomo died on November 20, 2015 as a result of that cancer. Although DiGiacomo's death occurred over 14 years after the attack and almost 2 years after the January 2014 dissolution of the Humane Law Enforcement Division, the Officer Down Memorial Page considers her death to be in the line of duty. This makes DiGiacomo the only known line of duty death in the history of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement Division.\n\nThe agents of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement have full police powers. Their police powers stem from a law that was written in 1866 by ASPCA founder Henry Bergh. They are certified New York State peace officers and have statewide jurisdiction, though they only work in the confines of New York City's 5 boroughs (Manhattan, Queens, Bronx, Brooklyn, and Staten Island).\n\nThe agents of the ASPCA Humane Law Enforcement have the same equipment NYPD police officers do, plus some items that are specialized for animal-related work. The agents are issued either a Glock 19 9mm or a Smith & Wesson 5906 9mm handgun, pepper spray, ASP baton, and handcuffs. Their squad cars are Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors, vans, and SUVs. They carry poles and cages for animal catches and seizures.\n\nThe success of \"Animal Precinct\" led Animal Planet to create an \"umbrella rotation\" of similar shows known collectively as \"Animal Planet Heroes\". Though the shows have similar formats, each has its own unique elements due to the differences in the ways the individual cities deal with animal care and cruelty cases. There have currently been eight similar shows based on the \"Animal Precinct\" concept:\n\nIn 2002, the series won the Genesis Award for the \"Best Reality Programming\" category.\n\n\n\n"}

First held in 2008, the Mini Challenge supported both the V8 Supercar Championship Series and the V8 Supercar Development Series. The category is managed by Toleman Motorsport, who took over management rights following the demise of previous rights holder, Sherrin Motorsport. Late in 2010, BMW announced the withdrawal of its support of the series, with the final running held at the 2010 Sydney Telstra 500.\n\nThe Australian Mini Challenge was launched by MINI Australia, being the department of BMW Group Australia responsible for the MINI brand. The National MINI Manager (General Manager of MINI brand in Australia) Justin Hocevar developed the business case, negotiated partnerships & launched the series.\n\nThe first and only order of 25 vehicles from BMW Group were imported ADR and duty exempt, for the explicit use of motorsport activities. The vehicles were rushed into production & arrived in Australia with little spare time for the first round, arriving via airfreight into Sydney. During their initial 'shakedown' event at Eastern Creek. The vehicles developed a technical problem with a turbo component (wastegate) which would cause the vehicles to go into 'limp-home' mode. Working through the night, local technicians liaised with technical support in Munich before a software patch was issued, a resulting modest power reduction meant the vehicles stayed below a certain heat range whereby the turbocharger wastegate component would fail.\n\nThe series was intended to support the development of the MINI brand in Australia. The purpose was to improve the masculinity / masculine appeal of the brand, to demonstrate the robustness of the vehicles and to develop the brand's performance credentials, particularly through the sub-brand JCW (John Cooper Works). As a result, the MINI brand in Australia enjoyed a high skew towards the more profitable JCW products. JCW sales in Australia ranked amongst the best-performing markets in the word.\n\nIn 2011 the series competitors were thrown a lifeline and invited to compete in the Australian Manufacturers' Championship, in a series called the AMC Mini Cup. The only changes to the rules were the requirement to run on radial tyres and the addition of a dry break fuel system to the cars for long distance events. The 2011 class pointscore was won by the only series regular Beric Lynton. Only three teams competed all season, the other two being the Sherrins Rentals team and Brendan Cook's team. All three cars never attended the same round however, with only one attending some rounds.\n\nThe R56 Mini hardtops were built by BMW Motorsport in Germany and flown to Australia. The Mini Challenge cars were based on the road going John Cooper works models, with a 1.6 litre, four cylinder, turbocharged engine producing 155kW (208hp). Weighing 1150kg (2535lb), the cars could accelerate to 100km/h (62mph) in just over six seconds and reach a top speed of 240km/h (149mph).\n\n"}
{"id": "462396", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=462396", "title": "Baryogenesis", "text": "Baryogenesis\n\nIn physical cosmology, baryogenesis is the hypothetical physical process that took place during the early universe that produced baryonic asymmetry, i.e. the imbalance of matter (baryons) and antimatter (antibaryons) in the observed universe.\n\nBaryogenesis theories are based on different descriptions of the interaction between fundamental particles. Two main theories are electroweak baryogenesis (standard model), which would occur during the electroweak epoch, and the GUT baryogenesis, which would occur during or shortly after the grand unification epoch. Quantum field theory and statistical physics are used to describe such possible mechanisms.\n\nBaryogenesis is followed by primordial nucleosynthesis, when atomic nuclei began to form.\n\nThe Dirac equation, formulated by Paul Dirac around 1928 as part of the development of relativistic quantum mechanics, predicts the existence of antiparticles along with the expected solutions for the corresponding particles. Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding antiparticle. Under the CPT theorem, a particle and its antiparticle have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.\n\nThere are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The second point of view is preferred, although there is no clear experimental evidence indicating either of them to be the correct one.\n\nIn 1967, Andrei Sakharov proposed a set of three necessary conditions that a baryon-generating interaction must satisfy to produce matter and antimatter at different rates. These conditions were inspired by the recent discoveries of the cosmic background radiation and CP-violation in the neutral kaon system. The three necessary \"Sakharov conditions\" are:\n\nBaryon number violation is obviously a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of left-handed baryons and right-handed anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium, since otherwise CPT symmetry would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number.\n\nCurrently, there is no experimental evidence of particle interactions where the conservation of baryon number is broken perturbatively: this would appear to suggest that all observed particle reactions have equal baryon number before and after. Mathematically, the commutator of the baryon number quantum operator with the (perturbative) Standard Model hamiltonian is zero: formula_2. However, the Standard Model is known to violate the conservation of baryon number only non-perturbatively: a global U(1) anomaly. To account for baryon violation in baryogenesis, such events (including proton decay) can occur in Grand Unification Theories (GUTs) and supersymmetric (SUSY) models via hypothetical massive bosons such as the X boson.\n\nThe second condition – violation of CP-symmetry – was discovered in 1964 (direct CP-violation, that is violation of CP-symmetry in a decay process, was discovered later, in 1999). Due to CPT symmetry, violation of CP-symmetry demands violation of time inversion symmetry, or T-symmetry.\n\nIn the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario, the last condition states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. In this situation the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation.\n\nThe Standard Model can incorporate baryogenesis, though the amount of net baryons (and leptons) thus created may not be sufficient to account for the present baryon asymmetry. This issue has not yet been determined decisively.\n\nBaryogenesis within the Standard Model requires the electroweak symmetry breaking be a first-order phase transition, since otherwise sphalerons wipe off any baryon asymmetry that happened up to the phase transition, while later the amount of baryon non-conserving interactions is negligible.\n\nThe phase transition domain wall breaks the P-symmetry spontaneously, allowing for CP-symmetry violating interactions to create C-asymmetry on both its sides: quarks tend to accumulate on the broken phase side of the domain wall, while anti-quarks tend to accumulate on its unbroken phase side. This happens as follows:\n\nDue to CP-symmetry violating electroweak interactions, some amplitudes involving quarks are not equal to the corresponding amplitudes involving anti-quarks, but rather have opposite phase (see CKM matrix and Kaon); since time reversal takes an amplitude to its complex conjugate, CPT-symmetry is conserved.\n\nThough some of their amplitudes have opposite phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on flavor and on the Higgs VEV which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, and it turns out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.\n\nThus there is a net baryonic flux through the domain wall. Due to sphaleron transitions, which are abundant in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped off. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe off the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons.\n\nIn this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak interactions (i.e. the sphaleron) are responsible for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the domain wall is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.\n\nThe challenges to the physics theories are then to explain \"how\" to produce this preference of matter over antimatter, and also the \"magnitude\" of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the \"asymmetry parameter\",\nThis quantity relates the overall number density difference between baryons and antibaryons (n and n, respectively) and the number density of cosmic background radiation photons n.\n\nAccording to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at a temperature of roughly kelvin, corresponding to an average kinetic energy of / () = . After the decoupling, the \"total\" number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature T per cubic centimeter, is given by\nwith k as the Boltzmann constant, ħ as the Planck constant divided by 2π and c as the speed of light in vacuum, and ζ(3) as\nApéry's constant. At the current CBR photon temperature of , this corresponds to a photon density n of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.\n\nTherefore, the asymmetry parameter η, as defined above, is \"not\" the \"good\" parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the entropy density s,\nbecause the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is\nwith p and ρ as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor T, and g as the effective number of degrees of freedom for \"massless\" particles (inasmuch as mc ≪ kT holds) at temperature T,\nfor bosons and fermions with g and g degrees of freedom at temperatures T and T respectively. At the present era, s = .\n\n\n"}

{"id": "23533641", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23533641", "title": "Death of Marvin Gaye", "text": "Death of Marvin Gaye\n\nMarvin Gaye was an American musician who gained worldwide fame for his work with Motown Records. He was fatally shot by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., on April 1, 1984, at their house in the West Adams district of Los Angeles, California. Gaye was shot twice following an altercation with his father after he intervened in an argument between his parents. The wounds were fatal and he was pronounced dead on arrival at the California Hospital Medical Center. Gaye's death inspired several musical tributes over the years including recollections of the incidents leading to his death. Gaye was given a burial plot at Forest Lawn Cemetery and was later cremated and his ashes spread around the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMarvin Gaye had an acrimonious relationship with his father, Marvin Gay Sr., since his childhood. Marvin Sr. was a Christian minister who was a strict disciplinarian and often physically punished his children. He was also a crossdresser, which was commonly known in the family's Washington, D.C. neighborhood and made the younger Marvin a target of bullying. It was because of this, added with rumors of Marvin's own homosexuality, that Marvin added an \"e\" to his last name when he became famous. Gaye's father never approved of his son's career in music, and gradually grew resentful that Gaye was closer to his mother, Alberta, and had become the breadwinner for the family. Despite a brief improvement in their relationship after Gaye found success with his album \"What's Going On\", father and son never found any lasting peace.\n\nBy 1983, after a period as a European tax exile, Gaye had re-emerged in the public eye with the hit song, \"Sexual Healing\" and its album, \"Midnight Love\". For a time, he had also achieved sobriety during his extensive stay in Belgium. Returning to the United States, he embarked on his final \"Sexual Healing Tour\" in April of that year. Gaye, who had a profound dislike for touring, returned to cocaine abuse to cope with the pressures of the road, and midway through the tour he developed paranoia over an alleged attempt on his life, wearing a bulletproof vest until he was on stage. In reality, there was little, if any, real danger, although while on the tour, road crew member Eric Sharpe committed suicide by hanging himself from a shower curtain rod in New Jersey.\n\nWhen the tour ended in August 1983, Gaye returned to the U.S. to nurse his mother, who was recovering from kidney surgery, and moved into his parents's residence at 2101 South Gramercy Place, a home which he bought for them in 1973. During his stay, Gaye's father was absent. That October, his father returned from a business trip in Washington during which he purchased insurance on his family's previous residence. Initially, Gaye's sisters Jeanne and Zeola lived in the house before Marvin Sr. returned to the property, and left shortly afterwards due to the growing conflict between father and son. For the next six months, the two men struggled to keep their distance from one another. During one quarrel at the house, the elder Gay called police to have his son leave the property. After staying with one of his sisters, however, Marvin returned to the property stating to a friend of his, \"After all, I have just one father. I want to make peace with him.\" Jeanne Gaye later told David Ritz that her father had told her if Marvin ever touched him, he'd \"kill him\".\n\nOn Christmas Day, 1983, Marvin gave his father a Smith & Wesson .38 special pistol so that he could protect himself from intruders. Friends and family members contended that the younger Marvin was often suicidal and paranoid, and by now was afraid of leaving his room and spoke of little besides suicide and death. He sometimes wore three overcoats and put his shoes on the wrong feet. Four days before his death, according to his sister Jeanne, Gaye had tried to kill himself by jumping out of a speeding sports car, suffering only minor bruises. Jeanne contended that \"there was no doubt Marvin wanted to die\" and that he \"couldn't take any more.\"\n\nIn the days prior to his death, Gaye's parents had arguments mainly over a misplaced insurance policy letter. The day before his death, the arguments spread to Gaye's bedroom. Angered by his father confronting his mother, Gaye commanded Marvin Sr. to leave her alone; Marvin Sr. complied without incident and there was no violence that night, but continued yelling throughout the house.\n\nAt approximately 12:30 p.m. (PST; 20:30 UTC) on April 1, 1984, an impatient Marvin Sr. shouted at his wife about the document. Gaye, dressed in a maroon robe, shouted back downstairs, telling his father if he had something to say, he'd better do it in person. According to Alberta, when Marvin Sr. refused his son's request, Gaye warned him not to come to his room. Marvin Sr., however, instead charged upstairs to the bedroom to verbally attack Alberta over the document, causing Gaye to jump out of his bed and once again order his father out of the room. When ordering did not work, Gaye, enraged and despondent, reportedly shoved his father out of the room into the hallway and subjected him to some severe physical violence, notably kicking and punching.\nAlberta later told Ritz: \"Marvin hit him. I shouted for him to stop, but he paid no attention to me. He gave my husband some hard kicks.\" Jeanne later recalled that it was understood in the family that if one of the children ever dared to strike their father that he would \"murder him or her\", saying her father \"made it very clear\" and \"said so publicly on more than one occasion.\" Gaye reportedly followed his father to the bedroom and, according to his mother, kicked him brutally. Eventually, Alberta separated Gaye from his father and returned him to his bedroom.\n\nMinutes later, at 12:38 p.m. (PST; 20:38 UTC), Marvin Sr. entered his bedroom, returning with the .38 pistol his son had bought him, pointed the gun at Gaye and shot him directly in the heart, as Alberta later explained to police:\n\nThe first shot, which proved to be fatal, entered the right side of Gaye's chest, perforating his right lung, heart, diaphragm, liver, stomach and left kidney before coming to rest against his left flank. Gaye's father stepped closer after the first shot and shot him a second time at point-blank range. In a 2018 episode of the Reelz TV series \"\", forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Hunter expressed his belief that Gaye was initially shot nonfatally in the left shoulder by his father while the two men were standing two feet apart while facing each other. Dr. Hunter believed that this first shot \"penetrated the left shoulder just below the clavicle and exited his back without causing any serious injury\", the impact of which caused Gaye to fall down. Hunter also believed that Gaye was then shot fatally in the chest, which \"had a very damaging and odd trajectory,\" traveling \"diagonally down through the lung, heart, diaphragm, liver, and kidney, finally embedding itself on the left side of the torso.\" From Hunter's point of view, \"the direction of the bullet's trajectory suggests Marvin was positioned toward his father, and that his father was likely to have been moving away at the time.\"\n\nAfraid of being shot next, Alberta screamed and ran out of the bedroom, all the while pleading in fear to her husband not to shoot her. According to reports, Gaye's father hid the gun underneath his pillow. In the meantime, Gaye's brother Frankie and his sister-in-law, Irene, heard the shots as they lived in a guest house on the property. After the first shot, Frankie initially thought it sounded like a car backfired. Afterwards, they heard screams from outside, rushed out, and saw Alberta who ran into Irene's arms, shouting, \"He's shot Marvin. He's killed my boy.\"\n\nFrankie ran to the house and carefully walked into the hallway to his brother's room, not knowing if Marvin Sr. still had the gun, whether he was still in the room, or if his brother was dead. After walking into Gaye's bedroom, an emotional Frankie held him as Gaye bled rapidly. According to Frankie, Gaye, barely speaking above a whisper, told him, \"I got what I wanted... I couldn't do it myself, so I had him do it... it's good, I ran my race, there's no more left in me.\" After police arrived, Irene went to Marvin Sr. in his bedroom and asked him where the gun was. After searching over his bedroom, Irene located it under his pillow. Upon exiting the house, Irene dropped the gun on the lawn. Immediately following this, Marvin Sr., who had by now taken a seat on the front porch outside the house, was arrested.\n\nThe police arrived twenty minutes after the shooting. Gaye's body was taken out of the house and sent to the California Hospital Medical Center. At approximately 1:01 p.m. (PST; 21:01 UTC), Gaye was pronounced dead on arrival. Gaye died on the day before his 45th birthday. As soon as his death was announced, several of Gaye's neighbors and onlookers paraded around the house, many in stunned shock and silence.\n\nAn autopsy was conducted on Gaye's body shortly after his death. Test results showed that he had elements of cocaine and PCP (or angel dust) in his system. After lawyers misread the coroner's report, Judge Ronald George determined later during preliminary hearings in the court case that PCP can often invoke violence. When told that the report had concluded only that Gaye had just cocaine traces in his system, the judge said PCP was not a major factor in his decision.\n\nDuring an interview with the police, Gaye's father contended that he was scared that something would happen to him and that he only meant to shoot in self-defense, stating he did not know the gun had any bullets in it, claiming he thought there were either \"blanks or BBs.\" When asked if he loved his son, Marvin Sr. reportedly stated in a soft voice, \"Let's say I didn't dislike him.\" Upon being told that his son had died from the shots, Marvin Sr. reportedly wept and sobbed after realizing he had killed him. Marvin Sr. was held on bond afterwards. It's believed by Gaye's siblings that his death was a \"premeditated suicide\". Jeanne later said that upon forcing his father's hand in the murder that he had \"accomplished three things. He put himself out of his misery. He brought relief to Mother by finally getting her husband out of her life. And he punished Father, by making certain that the rest of his life would be miserable... my brother knew just what he was doing.\"\n\nOn April 5, 1984, Gaye was given a star-studded funeral at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, attended by over 10,000 mourners, including his Motown colleagues; his two ex-wives, Anna Gaye and Janis Gaye; and his siblings, mother and three children. Smokey Robinson and Dick Gregory delivered eulogies, while Stevie Wonder performed \"Lighting Up the Candles,\" which was later placed on Wonder's soundtrack to the film \"Jungle Fever\", and Cecil T. \"Sesil J\" Jenkins sang \"The Lord's Prayer\". At the open-casket funeral, Gaye was wearing one of his costumes from his final concert tour, a gold and white military style uniform, with an ermine wrap at his shoulders. The funeral was presided by the Chief Apostle of Gaye's family's old church, the House of God. Following the funeral, Gaye was given a burial plot. In accordance with the family's request, Gaye's body was cremated with half of his ashes spread near the Pacific Ocean by his three children and Anna Gaye. Anna and their adopted son, Marvin III, then kept a small sample of the ashes for themselves.\n\nGaye left behind no will. As a result, his son Marvin III, aged 17 at the time, became co-administrator of his estate. At the time of his death, he was struggling financially, as the IRS had asked for $1 million (US$ in dollars) to pay back unpaid taxes of $600,000 (US$ in dollars) to the State of California and back alimony of $300,000 (US$ in dollars) to Anna and Janis Gaye. He was $1,900,000 (US$ in dollars) in debt at the time of his death, but royalties from Gaye's work eventually paid off those debts.\n\nMarvin Sr. was held at the Los Angeles County Jail on a $100,000 bail (US$ in dollars). His accounts of the shooting were printed in the \"Los Angeles Herald-Examiner\", quoting his words: \"I didn't mean to do it.\"\n\nDuring a check up at the County-USC Medical Center, a benign tumor was discovered at the base of Marvin Sr.'s brain. Doctors removed the tumor on May 17, 1984. On June 12, after reviewing a two-page report, including two psychiatric evaluations conducted by Dr. Ronald Markman, Judge Michael Pirosh ruled that Marvin Sr. was competent to stand trial. He appeared in court again on June 20, where he was ordered to return on July 16 for a preliminary hearing. His estranged wife, Alberta, posted the reduced bail of $30,000 via a bondsman to secure the ex-minister's release from jail. Two days earlier, she had filed for divorce, citing she officially separated from him following their son's fatal shooting on the same day. Looking over documents, the amount of drugs in Gaye's system, and pictures of Marvin Sr.'s injuries during his final fight with his son, Judge Ronald M. George agreed to grant Marvin Sr. a plea bargain. As a result, he pleaded no contest to a voluntary manslaughter charge on September 20, 1984. On November 2, 1984, Judge Gordon Ringer sentenced Marvin Sr. to a six-year suspended sentence and five years probation. During the sentencing hearing, Marvin Sr. tearfully told the court:\n\nNews stations reported on the death almost immediately after it was announced, with one of the most prominent announcements coming from CBS anchor Dan Rather. Eulogies were delivered in American, Asian and European countries. \"The New York Times\" ran the story in its front page the day after his death.\n\nInitial reactions to Gaye's death were shock on the part of many of his peers. Otis Williams, of the Motown group The Temptations, recalled receiving the news while touring with the Four Tops in Australia and said, \"It was a very dark day that I will never forget as the day I lost a friend.\" Former Motown staffer Janie Bradford and her husband were driving home after listening to radio all day when the announcer announced Gaye's death. CBS Urban president Larkin Arnold was also reportedly stunned with the news as he had tried to get Gaye in the studio for his follow-up to \"Midnight Love\". Smokey Robinson heard the news of Gaye's death on the radio. Feeling that his \"inners wouldn't accept\" the news, he called Gaye's ex-wife Anna to find out whether it was true, and she confirmed it before he could ask her, leaving Robinson in shock.\n\nLongtime Gaye admirer and former nephew-in-law Jermaine Jackson, brother of Michael Jackson, recalled sobbing uncontrollably once he heard the news and called Barry White to confirm the story. According to White, Gaye had agreed to do a series of duets with him. Ray Singleton, a former spouse of Berry Gordy's, received the news from Anna on the phone. Upon the arrival of her son and Gaye's adopted son, Marvin III, Raynoma told Gaye III to go upstairs and talk to his mother, who then told him the news.\n\nVH1 listed Gaye's death as the eighth most shocking moment in rock and roll. Recollections of the death from admirers of Gaye included rapper Chuck D and Al Sharpton, who replied that the death came \"like a sick, sad joke to all of us.\" Gordy, who was overcome with emotion and grief over Gaye's death, took out full-page ads following his funeral declaring that Gaye was \"the greatest of his time\" and the best recording artist he ever worked with. New wave band Duran Duran dedicated their hit song, \"Save a Prayer,\" to Gaye during a live concert the day following his death.\n\nImmediately after his death, numerous fans of Gaye stood outside the house at Gramercy Place, placed memorabilia and other items on the lawn, and held vigils there, until the next day, Gaye's birthday.\n\nGaye was placed on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\" for the third time in a posthumous cover in its May 10, 1984 issue. The issue discussed Gaye's personal life, his music, and his contributions to Motown and popular music.\n\nIn November 1984, Diana Ross released the tribute song, \"Missing You.\" It appeared on Ross' album, \"Swept Away\", and later peaked at #1 on the Hot Black Singles chart and placed at #10 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Later, a video of the song featured classic footage of Gaye, including footage of Gaye appearing at Ross' 1982 concert in Brussels. The following January while hosting the American Music Awards, Ross led an In Memoriam tribute to stars who died in 1984 with Gaye leading the tribute. Also in November 1984, Teena Marie released the tribute song, \"My Dear Mr. Gaye\" from her hit album, \"Starchild\", the highest selling album of her career. The Commodores issued the song \"Nightshift,\" which was dedicated to Gaye and fellow musician Jackie Wilson, who also died in 1984. The song, featured on their album of the same name, peaked at #1 on the rhythm and blues chart, reached the top ten on the Hot 100, and became a hit in other countries. Todd Rundgren's song \"Lost Horizon\" from his \"A Cappella\" album is said to be dedicated to Gaye. Rundgren later performed a medley of Gaye's hits during concerts and sometimes added \"Lost Horizon\" to the medley. In 1989, soul band Frankie Beverly & Maze produced the tribute song, \"Silky Soul,\" taking its melody from \"What's Going On.\" The song featured Nona Gaye in the video and later peaked at #5 on the R&B chart. At least two tribute albums of Gaye's have been released: 1995's \"\" and 1999's \"\".\n\nStarting in 1985, there have been annual Marvin Gaye Day celebrations in the city of Washington, D.C., Gaye's hometown. The day was officiated by then-mayor Marion Barry on the day of Gaye's 46th birthday. Since then, a non-profit organization has helped to organize Marvin Gaye Day celebrations in the city. In 1986, Marvin's mother Alberta founded the Marvin P. Gaye Jr. Memorial Foundation, which is dedicated to those suffering from drug abuse and alcoholism. It opened a day after she died from complications of bone cancer in May 1987. In 1990, after years of petitions and letters, Gaye was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, with one of its most prominent letters written by longtime fan Eddie Murphy. Six years later, in 1996, Gaye posthumously received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2006, an old park that Gaye frequented as a teenager, the former Watts Branch Park, was renamed Marvin Gaye Park in his honor. Three years later, in 2009, the 5200 block of Foote Street NE in Deanwood, Washington, D.C., was renamed Marvin Gaye Way.\n\nSince Gaye's death, fans of the singer have stood around Gaye's Walk of Fame star to pay tribute and sing songs of Gaye's in his honor during the week of April 1 through April 5 of each year. Several other fans have gathered around Gaye's final house in vigils.\n\n"}

On average one woman is murdered every 10 days. Although Paraguay has taken several measures to deal with this problem, including creating special police units for domestic violence victims, lack of adequate laws, as well as conservative attitudes within a male dominated society hinder progress.\n\nParaguay is a landlocked country in South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. The vast majority of its population identifies as Roman Catholic, and religion in Paraguay plays a very important role. Paraguay is a socially conservative society; and has been slow to change traditional views on family: divorce was legalized only in 1991.\n\nIt is very difficult to assess the extent of domestic violence. Most cases are not reported to authorities, and victims endure the violence privately. In a 2008 survey, 20.4% of the women interviewed in the survey (aged 15-49) said they suffered physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner. This was lower than many other countries in the area, but these figures, being self-reported, may reflect differing personal understanding of what constitutes abuse. Of women who said they experienced domestic abuse in the past 12 months, 12.9% said they sought any institutional help for the abuse.\n\nIn 2017, 770 instances of domestic violence against men by their partners were recorded (1,540 annualised). \n\nThe legal response of Paraguay to domestic violence has been very weak, even by Latin American standards. Although Paraguay enacted in 2000 \"Law No. 1,600 Against Domestic Violence\" (Ley No 1.600 contra la Violencia Doméstica), this law - while having a broad definition of domestic violence (including physical, psychological and sexual abuse \"lesiones, maltratos físicos, psíquicos o sexuales\" ) - is civil in nature, and as such does not provide for any sanctions against the perpetrators. \n\nWhile the Criminal Code provides for a crime of domestic violence, this crime has a very narrow definition, as physical violence that is carried out habitually, and is punishable by a fine only. As of 2014, there have been increasing calls, from both inside and outside of the country, for the enactment of a comprehensive law against violence against women.\n\n"}

Visitors to the festival are invited to sample cuisine and celebrate the cultural and ethnic heritage of people from dozens of cultures who have made Winnipeg their home. Folklorama is the world's largest and longest-running multicultural festival.\n\nEach culture has an assigned venue, known as a pavilion. Typically there are over 40 pavilions presented throughout the city, with half operating in week one and half in week two of the festival. Each pavilion presents a show featuring the song and dance of their culture, along with trademark ethnic cuisine and a cultural display. Some pavilions also incorporate additional services such as henna tattoo application, and some have late night parties. Most pavilions provide imported cultural beverage.\n\nFolklorama provides exposure to cultural groups and brings in thousands of tourists each year, adding to the city's economy. It is the largest and longest-running festival of its kind in the world (determined by the International Council of Organizations for Folklore Festivals and Folk Art, also known as CIOFF). The Folk Arts Council of Winnipeg is the organizing body of Folklorama.\n\nFolklorama was first held in August 1970. It was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence in celebration of Manitoba's centennial. It was deemed such a success that it became an annual event. The first festival was only a week long, featuring 21 different cultures; it drew approximately 75,000 separate pavilion visits. The festival adopted its current two-week format in 1988, with half of the pavilions open in each week. As of 2016, only four of the original pavilions have been open every year. They are: German, Ukraine-Kyiv, Greek, and Scandinavian.\n\nThe Folklorama logo was designed by Andy Stout who won the provincial logo contest in 1980. The 4 figures in the logo represent people from the four corners of the globe, who are intertwined, with arms raised in celebration. The festival's mascot, the Folklorama Llama, was created in 1986.\n\nUntil 1990, pavilions would have a mayor and a queen. The queen would be in the running for the Miss Folklorama pageant at the end of the Festival. The Miss Folklorama pageant was not a beauty pageant but a \"contest of ethnic preservation and presentation\". Since 1990, pavilions now feature two adult ambassadors and two youth ambassadors, neither of whom must be of a specific gender.\n\nThroughout the year, Folklorama is sustained by three business divisions: Travel, Talent, and Teachings.\n\n"}
{"id": "31666", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=31666", "title": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution was adopted on July 9, 1868, as one of the Reconstruction Amendments. Arguably one of the most consequential amendments to this day, the amendment addresses citizenship rights and equal protection of the laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress. The amendment, particularly its first section, is one of the most litigated parts of the Constitution, forming the basis for landmark decisions such as \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) regarding racial segregation, \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973) regarding abortion, \"Bush v. Gore\" (2000) regarding the 2000 presidential election, and \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (2015) regarding same-sex marriage. The amendment limits the actions of all state and local officials, including those acting on behalf of such an official.\n\nThe amendment's first section includes several clauses: the Citizenship Clause, Privileges or Immunities Clause, Due Process Clause, and Equal Protection Clause. The Citizenship Clause provides a broad definition of citizenship, nullifying the Supreme Court's decision in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" (1857), which had held that Americans descended from African slaves could not be citizens of the United States. Since the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" (1873), the Privileges or Immunities Clause has been interpreted to do very little.\n\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits state and local government officials from depriving persons of life, liberty, or property without legislative authorization. This clause has also been used by the federal judiciary to make most of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states, as well as to recognize substantive and procedural requirements that state laws must satisfy. The Equal Protection Clause requires each state to provide equal protection under the law to all people, including all non-citizens, within its jurisdiction. This clause has been the basis for many decisions rejecting irrational or unnecessary discrimination against people belonging to various groups.\n\nThe second, third, and fourth sections of the amendment are seldom litigated. However, the second section's reference to \"rebellion, or other crime\" has been invoked as a constitutional ground for felony disenfranchisement. The fourth section was held, in \"Perry v. United States\" (1935), to prohibit a current Congress from abrogating a contract of debt incurred by a prior Congress. The fifth section gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment's provisions by \"appropriate legislation\"; however, under \"City of Boerne v. Flores\" (1997), this power may not be used to contradict a Supreme Court decision interpreting the amendment.\n\nIn the final years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress repeatedly debated the rights of black former slaves freed by the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the 1865 Thirteenth Amendment, the latter of which had formally abolished slavery. Following the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment by Congress, however, Republicans grew concerned over the increase it would create in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern States. Because the full population of freed slaves would now be counted for determining congressional representation, rather than the three-fifths previously mandated by the Three-Fifths Compromise, the Southern States would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives, regardless of whether the former slaves were allowed to vote. Republicans began looking for a way to offset this advantage, either by protecting and attracting votes of former slaves, or at least by discouraging their disenfranchisement.\n\nIn 1865, Congress passed what would become the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing citizenship without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. The bill also guaranteed equal benefits and access to the law, a direct assault on the Black Codes passed by many post-war states. The Black Codes attempted to return ex-slaves to something like their former condition by, among other things, restricting their movement, forcing them to enter into year-long labor contracts, prohibiting them from owning firearms, and preventing them from suing or testifying in court.\n\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates in Congress to sign the bill, President Andrew Johnson vetoed it on March 27, 1866. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African-Americans and against whites. Three weeks later, Johnson's veto was overridden and the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress really possessed constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience also encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.\n\nOver 70 proposals for an amendment were drafted. In late 1865, the Joint Committee on Reconstruction proposed an amendment stating that any citizens barred from voting on the basis of race by a state would not be counted for purposes of representation of that state. This amendment passed the House, but was blocked in the Senate by a coalition of Radical Republicans led by Charles Sumner, who believed the proposal a \"compromise with wrong\", and Democrats opposed to black rights. Consideration then turned to a proposed amendment by Representative John A. Bingham of Ohio, which would enable Congress to safeguard \"equal protection of life, liberty, and property\" of all citizens; this proposal failed to pass the House. In April 1866, the Joint Committee forwarded a third proposal to Congress, a carefully negotiated compromise that combined elements of the first and second proposals as well as addressing the issues of Confederate debt and voting by ex-Confederates. The House of Representatives passed \"House Resolution 127, 39th Congress\" several weeks later and sent to the Senate for action. The resolution was debated and several amendments to it were proposed. Amendments to Sections 2, 3, and 4 were adopted on June 8, 1866, and the modified resolution passed by a 33 to 11 vote (5 absent, not voting). The House agreed to the Senate amendments on June 13 by a 138–36 vote (10 not voting). A concurrent resolution requesting the President to transmit the proposal to the executives of the several states was passed by both houses of Congress on June 18.\n\nThe Radical Republicans were satisfied that they had secured civil rights for blacks, but were disappointed that the amendment would not also secure political rights for blacks; in particular, the right to vote. For example, Thaddeus Stevens, a leader of the disappointed Radical Republicans, said: \"I find that we shall be obliged to be content with patching up the worst portions of the ancient edifice, and leaving it, in many of its parts, to be swept through by the tempests, the frosts, and the storms of despotism.\" Abolitionist Wendell Phillips called it a \"fatal and total surrender\". This point would later be addressed by the Fifteenth Amendment.\n\nOn June 16, 1866, Secretary of State William Seward transmitted the Fourteenth Amendment to the governors of the several states for its ratification. State legislatures in every formerly Confederate state, with the exception of Tennessee, refused to ratify it. This refusal led to the passage of the Reconstruction Acts. Ignoring the existing state governments, military government was imposed until new civil governments were established and the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. It also prompted Congress to pass a law on March 2, 1867, requiring that a former Confederate state must ratify the Fourteenth Amendment before \"said State shall be declared entitled to representation in Congress\".\n\nThe first twenty-eight states to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment were:\n\nIf rescission by Ohio and New Jersey were invalid, South Carolina would have been the 28th State. Rescission by Oregon did not occur until later. These rescissions caused significant controversy. However, ratification by other states continued during the course of the debate:\n\nOn July 20, 1868, Secretary of State William H. Seward certified that if withdrawals of ratification by New Jersey and Ohio were ineffective, then the amendment had become part of the Constitution on July 9, 1868, with ratification by South Carolina. The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment to be a part of the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to promulgate it as such. Both New Jersey and Ohio were named in the congressional resolution as having ratified the amendment, although Alabama was also named, making 29 states total.\n\nOn the same day, one more State ratified:\n\nOn July 27, Secretary Seward received the formal ratification from Georgia. The following day, July 28, Secretary Seward issued his official proclamation certifying the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. Secretary Seward stated that his proclamation was \"in conformance\" to the resolution by Congress, but his official list of States included both Alabama and Georgia, as well as Ohio and New Jersey.\n\nThe inclusion of Ohio and New Jersey has led some to question the validity of rescission of a ratification. The inclusion of Alabama and Georgia has called that conclusion into question. While there have been Supreme Court cases dealing with ratification issues, this particular question has never been adjudicated.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was subsequently ratified:\n\nSince Ohio and New Jersey re-ratified the Fourteenth Amendment in 2003, all U.S. states that existed during Reconstruction have ratified the amendment.\n\nSection 1 of the amendment formally defines United States citizenship and also protects various civil rights from being abridged or denied by any state or state actor. Abridgment or denial of those civil rights by private persons is not addressed by this amendment; the Supreme Court held in the \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883) that the amendment was limited to \"state action\" and, therefore, did not authorize the Congress to outlaw racial discrimination by private individuals or organizations (though Congress can sometimes reach such discrimination via other parts of the Constitution). U.S. Supreme Court Justice Joseph P. Bradley commented in the Civil Rights Cases that \"individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] Amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all state legislation, and state action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThe Radical Republicans who advanced the Thirteenth Amendment hoped to ensure broad civil and human rights for the newly freed people—but its scope was disputed before it even went into effect. The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment wanted these principles enshrined in the Constitution to protect the new Civil Rights Act from being declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and also to prevent a future Congress from altering it by a mere majority vote. This section was also in response to violence against black people within the Southern States. The Joint Committee on Reconstruction found that only a Constitutional amendment could protect black people's rights and welfare within those states.\n\nSection 1 has been the most frequently litigated part of the amendment, and this amendment in turn has been the most frequently litigated part of the Constitution.\n\nThe Citizenship Clause overruled the Supreme Court's \"Dred Scott\" decision that black people were not citizens and could not become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.\n\nThere are varying interpretations of the original intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, as well as the customs and understandings prevalent at that time. Some of the major issues that have arisen about this clause are the extent to which it included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present in the United States when they have a child, whether the clause allows revocation of citizenship, and whether the clause applies to illegal immigrants.\n\nHistorian Eric Foner, who has explored the question of U.S. birthright citizenship to other countries, argues that:\n\nDuring the original congressional debate over the amendment Senator Jacob M. Howard of Michigan—the author of the Citizenship Clause—described the clause as having the same content, despite different wording, as the earlier Civil Rights Act of 1866, namely, that it excludes Native Americans who maintain their tribal ties and \"persons born in the United States who are foreigners, aliens, who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers.\" According to historian Glenn W. LaFantasie of Western Kentucky University, \"A good number of his fellow senators supported his view of the citizenship clause.\" Others also agreed that the children of ambassadors and foreign ministers were to be excluded.\n\nSenator James Rood Doolittle of Wisconsin asserted that all Native Americans were subject to United States jurisdiction, so that the phrase \"Indians not taxed\" would be preferable, but Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lyman Trumbull and Howard disputed this, arguing that the federal government did not have full jurisdiction over Native American tribes, which govern themselves and make treaties with the United States. In \"Elk v. Wilkins\" (1884), the clause's meaning was tested regarding whether birth in the United States automatically extended national citizenship. The Supreme Court held that Native Americans who voluntarily quit their tribes did not automatically gain national citizenship. The issue was resolved with the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, which granted full U.S. citizenship to indigenous peoples.\n\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that children born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction become American citizens at birth. At the time of the amendment's passage, President Andrew Johnson and three Senators, including Trumbull, the author of the Civil Rights Act, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship to children born to foreign nationals in the United States. Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a decidedly different opinion. Some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause should apply to the children of unauthorized immigrants today, as \"the problem ... did not exist at the time\". In the 21st century, Congress has occasionally discussed passing a statute or a constitutional amendment to reduce the practice of \"birth tourism\", in which a foreign national gives birth in the United States to gain the child's citizenship.\n\nThe clause's meaning with regard to a child of immigrants was tested in \"United States v. Wong Kim Ark\" (1898). The Supreme Court held that under the Fourteenth Amendment, a man born within the United States to Chinese citizens who have a permanent domicile and residence in the United States and are carrying out business in the United States—and whose parents were not employed in a diplomatic or other official capacity by a foreign power—was a citizen of the United States. Subsequent decisions have applied the principle to the children of foreign nationals of non-Chinese descent.\n\nAccording to the Foreign Affairs Manual, which is published by the Department of State, \"Despite widespread popular belief, U.S. military installations abroad and U.S. diplomatic or consular facilities abroad are not part of the United States within the meaning of the [Fourteenth] Amendment.\"\n\nLoss of national citizenship is possible only under the following circumstances:\n\nFor much of the country's history, voluntary acquisition or exercise of a foreign citizenship was considered sufficient cause for revocation of national citizenship. This concept was enshrined in a series of treaties between the United States and other countries (the Bancroft Treaties). However, the Supreme Court repudiated this concept in \"Afroyim v. Rusk\" (1967), as well as \"Vance v. Terrazas\" (1980), holding that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment barred the Congress from revoking citizenship. However, Congress can revoke citizenship that it had previously granted to a person not born in the United States.\n\nThe Privileges or Immunities Clause, which protects the privileges and immunities of national citizenship from interference by the states, was patterned after the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, which protects the privileges and immunities of state citizenship from interference by other states. In the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" (1873), the Supreme Court concluded that the Constitution recognized two separate types of citizenship—\"national citizenship\" and \"state citizenship\"—and the Court held that the Privileges or Immunities Clause prohibits states from interfering only with privileges and immunities possessed by virtue of national citizenship. The Court concluded that the privileges and immunities of national citizenship included only those rights that \"owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.\" The Court recognized few such rights, including access to seaports and navigable waterways, the right to run for federal office, the protection of the federal government while on the high seas or in the jurisdiction of a foreign country, the right to travel to the seat of government, the right to peaceably assemble and petition the government, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the right to participate in the government's administration. This decision has not been overruled and has been specifically reaffirmed several times. Largely as a result of the narrowness of the \"Slaughter-House\" opinion, this clause subsequently lay dormant for well over a century.\n\nIn \"Saenz v. Roe\" (1999), the Court ruled that a component of the \"right to travel\" is protected by the Privileges or Immunities Clause:\nJustice Miller actually wrote in the \"Slaughter-House Cases\" that the right to become a citizen of a state (by residing in that state) \"is conferred by \"the very article\" under consideration\" (emphasis added), rather than by the \"clause\" under consideration.\n\nIn \"McDonald v. Chicago \"(2010), Justice Clarence Thomas, while concurring with the majority in incorporating the Second Amendment against the states, declared that he reached this conclusion through the Privileges or Immunities Clause instead of the Due Process Clause. Randy Barnett has referred to Justice Thomas's concurring opinion as a \"complete restoration\" of the Privileges or Immunities Clause.\n\nIn the 1884 case of \"Hurtado v. California\", the U.S. Supreme Court said:\n\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only against the states, but it is otherwise textually identical to the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, which applies against the federal government; both clauses have been interpreted to encompass identical doctrines of procedural due process and substantive due process. Procedural due process is the guarantee of a fair legal process when the government tries to interfere with a person's protected interests in life, liberty, or property, and substantive due process is the guarantee that the fundamental rights of citizens will not be encroached on by government. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment also incorporates most of the provisions in the Bill of Rights, which were originally applied against only the federal government, and applies them against the states.\n\nBeginning with \"Allgeyer v. Louisiana\" (1897), the Court interpreted the Due Process Clause as providing substantive protection to private contracts, thus prohibiting a variety of social and economic regulation; this principle was referred to as \"freedom of contract.\" Thus, the Court struck down a law decreeing maximum hours for workers in a bakery in \"Lochner v. New York\" (1905) and struck down a minimum wage law in \"Adkins v. Children's Hospital\" (1923). In \"Meyer v. Nebraska\" (1923), the Court stated that the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause\nHowever, the Court did uphold some economic regulation, such as state Prohibition laws (\"Mugler v. Kansas\", 1887), laws declaring maximum hours for mine workers (\"Holden v. Hardy\", 1898), laws declaring maximum hours for female workers (\"Muller v. Oregon\", 1908), and President Woodrow Wilson's intervention in a railroad strike (\"Wilson v. New\", 1917), as well as federal laws regulating narcotics (\"United States v. Doremus\", 1919). The Court repudiated, but did not explicitly overrule, the \"freedom of contract\" line of cases in \"West Coast Hotel v. Parrish\" (1937).\n\nIn \"Poe v. Ullman\" (1961), dissenting judge John Marshall Harlan II adopted a broad view of the \"liberty\" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process clause:\n\nThis broad view of liberty was adopted by the Supreme Court in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (for further information see below). Although the \"freedom of contract\" described above has fallen into disfavor, by the 1960s, the Court had extended its interpretation of substantive due process to include other rights and freedoms that are not enumerated in the Constitution but that, according to the Court, extend or derive from existing rights. For example, the Due Process Clause is also the foundation of a constitutional right to privacy. The Court first ruled that privacy was protected by the Constitution in \"Griswold v. Connecticut\" (1965), which overturned a Connecticut law criminalizing birth control. While Justice William O. Douglas wrote for the majority that the right to privacy was found in the \"penumbras\" of various provisions in the Bill of Rights, Justices Arthur Goldberg and John Marshall Harlan II wrote in concurring opinions that the \"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause included individual privacy.\n\nThe right to privacy was the basis for \"Roe v. Wade\" (1973), in which the Court invalidated a Texas law forbidding abortion except to save the mother's life. Like Goldberg's and Harlan's concurring opinions in \"Griswold\", the majority opinion authored by Justice Harry Blackmun located the right to privacy in the Due Process Clause's protection of liberty. The decision disallowed many state and federal abortion restrictions, and it became one of the most controversial in the Court's history. In \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" (1992), the Court decided that \"the essential holding of \"Roe v. Wade\" should be retained and once again reaffirmed.\"\n\nIn \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003), the Court found that a Texas law against same-sex sexual intercourse violated the right to privacy. In \"Obergefell v. Hodges\" (2015), the Court ruled that the fundamental right to marriage included same-sex couples being able to marry.\n\nWhen the government seeks to burden a person's protected liberty interest or property interest, the Supreme Court has held that procedural due process requires that, at a minimum, the government provide the person notice, an opportunity to be heard at an oral hearing, and a decision by a neutral decision maker. For example, such process is due when a government agency seeks to terminate civil service employees, expel a student from public school, or cut off a welfare recipient's benefits. The Court has also ruled that the Due Process Clause requires judges to recuse themselves in cases where the judge has a conflict of interest. For example, in \"Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co.\" (2009), the Court ruled that a justice of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia had to recuse himself from a case involving a major contributor to his campaign for election to that court.\n\nWhile many state constitutions are modeled after the United States Constitution and federal laws, those state constitutions did not necessarily include provisions comparable to the Bill of Rights. In \"Barron v. Baltimore\" (1833), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the Bill of Rights restrained only the federal government, not the states. However, the Supreme Court has subsequently held that most provisions of the Bill of Rights apply to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment under a doctrine called \"incorporation.\"\n\nWhether incorporation was intended by the amendment's framers, such as John Bingham, has been debated by legal historians. According to legal scholar Akhil Reed Amar, the framers and early supporters of the Fourteenth Amendment believed that it would ensure that the states would be required to recognize the same individual rights as the federal government; all of these rights were likely understood as falling within the \"privileges or immunities\" safeguarded by the amendment.\n\nBy the latter half of the 20th century, nearly all of the rights in the Bill of Rights had been applied to the states. The Supreme Court has held that the amendment's Due Process Clause incorporates all of the substantive protections of the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth (except for its Grand Jury Clause) and Sixth Amendments and the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment. While the Third Amendment has not been applied to the states by the Supreme Court, the Second Circuit ruled that it did apply to the states within that circuit's jurisdiction in \"Engblom v. Carey\". The Seventh Amendment right to jury trial in civil cases has been held not to be applicable to the states, but the amendment's Re-Examination Clause applies not only to federal courts, but also to \"a case tried before a jury in a state court and brought to the Supreme Court on appeal.\"\n\nOn June 18, 2018, the Supreme Court agreed to hear \"Timbs v. Indiana\" so it could decide whether the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment should be applied to the states.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause was created largely in response to the lack of equal protection provided by law in states with Black Codes. Under Black Codes, blacks could not sue, give evidence, or be witnesses. They also were punished more harshly than whites. In 1880, the Supreme Court stated in \"Strauder v. West Virginia\" that the Equal Protection Clause was\n\nThe Clause mandates that individuals in similar situations be treated equally by the law. Although the text of the Fourteenth Amendment applies the Equal Protection Clause only against the states, the Supreme Court, since \"Bolling v. Sharpe\" (1954), has applied the Clause against the federal government through the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment under a doctrine called \"reverse incorporation.\"\n\nIn \"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\" (1886), the Supreme Court has clarified that the meaning of \"person\" and \"within its jurisdiction\" in the Equal Protection Clause would not be limited to discrimination against African Americans, but would extend to other races, colors, and nationalities such as (in this case) legal aliens in the United States who are Chinese citizens:\n\nPersons \"within its jurisdiction\" are entitled to equal protection from a state. Largely because the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV has from the beginning guaranteed the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states, the Supreme Court has rarely construed the phrase \"within its jurisdiction\" in relation to natural persons. In \"Plyler v. Doe\" (1982), where the Court held that aliens illegally present in a state are \"within its jurisdiction\" and may thus raise equal protection claims the Court explicated the meaning of the phrase \"within its jurisdiction\" as follows: \"[U]se of the phrase \"within its jurisdiction\" confirms the understanding that the Fourteenth Amendment's protection extends to anyone, citizen or stranger, who is subject to the laws of a State, and reaches into every corner of a State's territory.\" The Court reached this understanding among other things from Senator Howard, a member of the Joint Committee of Fifteen, and the floor manager of the amendment in the Senate. Senator Howard was explicit about the broad objectives of the Fourteenth Amendment and the intention to make its provisions applicable to all who \"may happen to be\" within the jurisdiction of a state:\n\nThe relationship between the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments was addressed by Justice Field in \"Wong Wing v. United States\" (1896). He observed with respect to the phrase \"within its jurisdiction\": \"The term 'person,' used in the Fifth Amendment, is broad enough to include any and every human being within the jurisdiction of the republic. A resident, alien born, is entitled to the same protection under the laws that a citizen is entitled to. He owes obedience to the laws of the country in which he is domiciled, and, as a consequence, he is entitled to the equal protection of those laws. ... The contention that persons within the territorial jurisdiction of this republic might be beyond the protection of the law was heard with pain on the argument at the bar—in face of the great constitutional amendment which declares that no State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court also decided whether foreign corporations are also \"within the jurisdiction\" of a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court in which it was not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was \"within the jurisdiction\" and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to equal protection of the laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.\n\nIn \"Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad\" (1886), the court reporter included a statement by Chief Justice Morrison Waite in the decision's headnote:\n\nThis dictum, which established that corporations enjoyed personhood under the Equal Protection Clause, was repeatedly reaffirmed by later courts. It remained the predominant view throughout the twentieth century, though it was challenged in dissents by justices such as Hugo Black and William O. Douglas. Between 1890 and 1910, Fourteenth Amendment cases involving corporations vastly outnumbered those involving the rights of blacks, 288 to 19.\n\nIn the decades following the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court overturned laws barring blacks from juries (\"Strauder v. West Virginia\", 1880) or discriminating against Chinese Americans in the regulation of laundry businesses (\"Yick Wo v. Hopkins\", 1886), as violations of the Equal Protection Clause. However, in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" (1896), the Supreme Court held that the states could impose segregation so long as they provided similar facilities—the formation of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine.\n\nThe Court went even further in restricting the Equal Protection Clause in \"Berea College v. Kentucky\" (1908), holding that the states could force private actors to discriminate by prohibiting colleges from having both black and white students. By the early 20th century, the Equal Protection Clause had been eclipsed to the point that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. dismissed it as \"the usual last resort of constitutional arguments.\"\nThe Court held to the \"separate but equal\" doctrine for more than fifty years, despite numerous cases in which the Court itself had found that the segregated facilities provided by the states were almost never equal, until \"Brown v. Board of Education\" (1954) reached the Court. In \"Brown\" the Court ruled that even if segregated black and white schools were of equal quality in facilities and teachers, segregation was inherently harmful to black students and so was unconstitutional. \"Brown\" met with a campaign of resistance from white Southerners, and for decades the federal courts attempted to enforce \"Brown\"s mandate against repeated attempts at circumvention. This resulted in the controversial desegregation busing decrees handed down by federal courts in various parts of the nation. In \"Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1\" (2007), the Court ruled that race could not be the determinative factor in determining to which public schools parents may transfer their children.\n\nIn \"Plyler v. Doe\" (1982) the Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute denying free public education to illegal immigrants as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because discrimination on the basis of illegal immigration status did not further a substantial state interest. The Court reasoned that illegal aliens and their children, though not citizens of the United States or Texas, are people \"in any ordinary sense of the term\" and, therefore, are afforded Fourteenth Amendment protections.\n\nIn \"Hernandez v. Texas\" (1954), the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment protects those beyond the racial classes of white or \"Negro\" and extends to other racial and ethnic groups, such as Mexican Americans in this case. In the half-century following \"Brown\", the Court extended the reach of the Equal Protection Clause to other historically disadvantaged groups, such as women and illegitimate children, although it has applied a somewhat less stringent standard than it has applied to governmental discrimination on the basis of race (\"United States v. Virginia\" (1996); \"Levy v. Louisiana\" (1968).)\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in \"Regents of the University of California v. Bakke\" (1978) that affirmative action in the form of racial quotas in public university admissions was a violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; however, race could be used as one of several factors without violating of the Equal Protection Clause or Title VI. In \"Gratz v. Bollinger\" (2003) and \"Grutter v. Bollinger\" (2003), the Court considered two race-conscious admissions systems at the University of Michigan. The university claimed that its goal in its admissions systems was to achieve racial diversity. In \"Gratz\", the Court struck down a points-based undergraduate admissions system that added points for minority status, finding that its rigidity violated the Equal Protection Clause; in \"Grutter\", the Court upheld a race-conscious admissions process for the university's law school that used race as one of many factors to determine admission. In \"Fisher v. University of Texas\" (2013), the Court ruled that before race can be used in a public university's admission policy, there must be no workable race-neutral alternative. In \"Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action\" (2014), the Court upheld the constitutionality of a state constitutional prohibition on the state or local use of affirmative action.\n\n\"Reed v. Reed\" (1971), which struck down an Idaho probate law favoring men, was the first decision in which the Court ruled that arbitrary gender discrimination violated the Equal Protection Clause. In \"Craig v. Boren\" (1976), the Court ruled that statutory or administrative sex classifications had to be subjected to an intermediate standard of judicial review. \"Reed\" and \"Craig\" later served as precedents to strike down a number of state laws discriminating by gender.\n\nSince \"Wesberry v. Sanders\" (1964) and \"Reynolds v. Sims\" (1964), the Supreme Court has interpreted the Equal Protection Clause as requiring the states to apportion their congressional districts and state legislative seats according to \"one man, one vote\". The Court has also struck down redistricting plans in which race was a key consideration. In \"Shaw v. Reno\" (1993), the Court prohibited a North Carolina plan aimed at creating majority-black districts to balance historic underrepresentation in the state's congressional delegations.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause served as the basis for the decision in \"Bush v. Gore\" (2000), in which the Court ruled that no constitutionally valid recount of Florida's votes in the 2000 presidential election could be held within the needed deadline; the decision effectively secured Bush's victory in the disputed election. In \"League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry\" (2006), the Court ruled that House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's Texas redistricting plan intentionally diluted the votes of Latinos and thus violated the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nIndividual liberties guaranteed by the United States Constitution, other than the Thirteenth Amendment's ban on slavery, protect not against actions by private persons or entities, but only against actions by government officials. Regarding the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Shelley v. Kraemer\" (1948): \"[T]he action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\" The court added in \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883): \"It is State action of a particular character that is prohibited. Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject matter of the amendment. It has a deeper and broader scope. It nullifies and makes void all State legislation, and State action of every kind, which impairs the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or property without due process of law, or which denies to any of them the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nVindication of federal constitutional rights are limited to those situations where there is \"state action\" meaning action of government officials who are exercising their governmental power. In \"Ex parte Virginia\" (1880), the Supreme Court found that the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment \"have reference to actions of the political body denominated by a State, by whatever instruments or in whatever modes that action may be taken. A State acts by its legislative, its executive, or its judicial authorities. It can act in no other way. The constitutional provision, therefore, must mean that no agency of the State, or of the officers or agents by whom its powers are exerted, shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Whoever, by virtue of public position under a State government, deprives another of property, life, or liberty, without due process of law, or denies or takes away the equal protection of the laws, violates the constitutional inhibition; and as he acts in the name and for the State, and is clothed with the State's power, his act is that of the State.\"\n\nThere are however instances where people are the victims of civil-rights violations that occur in circumstances involving both government officials and private actors. In the 1960s, the United States Supreme Court adopted an expansive view of state action opening the door to wide-ranging civil-rights litigation against private actors when they act as state actors (i.e., acts done or otherwise \"sanctioned in some way\" by the state). The Court found that the state action doctrine is equally applicable to denials of privileges or immunities, due process, and equal protection of the laws.\n\nThe critical factor in determining the existence of state action is not governmental involvement with private persons or private corporations, but \"the inquiry must be whether there is a sufficiently close nexus between the State and the challenged action of the regulated entity so that the action of the latter may be fairly treated as that of the State itself.\" \"Only by sifting facts and weighing circumstances can the nonobvious involvement of the State in private conduct be attributed its true significance.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court asserted that plaintiffs must establish not only that a private party \"acted under color of the challenged statute, but also that its actions are properly attributable to the State. [...]\" \"And the actions are to be attributable to the State apparently only if the State compelled the actions and not if the State merely established the process through statute or regulation under which the private party acted.\"\n\nThe rules developed by the Supreme Court for business regulation are that (1) the \"mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation does not by itself convert its action into that of the State for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment,\" and (2) \"a State normally can be held responsible for a private decision only when it has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must be deemed to be that of the State.\"\n\nUnder , the basis of representation of each state in the House of Representatives was determined by adding three-fifths of each state's slave population to its free population. Because slavery (except as punishment for crime) had been abolished by the Thirteenth Amendment, the freed slaves would henceforth be given full weight for purposes of apportionment. This situation was a concern to the Republican leadership of Congress, who worried that it would increase the political power of the former slave states, even as they continued to deny freed slaves the right to vote.\n\nTwo solutions were considered:\n\n\nOn January 31, 1866, the House of Representatives voted in favor of a proposed constitutional amendment that would reduce a state's representation in the House in proportion to which that state used \"race or color\" as a basis to deny the right to vote in that state. The amendment failed in the Senate, partly because radical Republicans foresaw that states would be able to use ostensibly race-neutral criteria, such as educational and property qualifications, to disenfranchise the freed slaves without negative consequence. So the amendment was changed to penalize states in which the vote was denied to male citizens over twenty-one for \"any\" reason other than participation in crime. Later, the Fifteenth Amendment was adopted to guarantee the right to vote could not be denied based on race or color.\n\nThe effect of Section 2 was twofold:\n\n\nThe first reapportionment after the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment occurred in 1873, based on the 1870 census. Congress appears to have attempted to enforce the provisions of Section 2, but was unable to identify enough disenfranchised voters to make a difference to any state's representation. In the implementing statute, Congress added a provision stating that A nearly identical provision remains in federal law to this day.\n\nDespite this legislation, in subsequent reapportionments, no change has ever been made to any state's Congressional representation on the basis of the Amendment. Bonfield, writing in 1960, suggested that \"[t]he hot political nature of such proposals has doomed them to failure\". Aided by this lack of enforcement, southern states continued to use pretexts to prevent many blacks from voting until the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn the Fourth Circuit case of \"Saunders v Wilkins\" (1945), Saunders claimed that Virginia should have its Congressional representation reduced because of its use of a poll tax and other voting restrictions. The plaintiff sued for the right to run for Congress at large in the state, rather than in one of its designated Congressional districts. The lawsuit was dismissed as a political question.\n\nSome have argued that Section 2 was implicitly repealed by the Fifteenth Amendment, but the Supreme Court acknowledged the provisions of Section 2 in some later decisions. In \"Minor v. Happersett\" (1875), the Supreme Court cited Section 2 as supporting its conclusion that the right to vote was not among the \"privileges and immunities of citizenship\" protected by Section 1. In \"Richardson v. Ramirez\" (1974), the Court cited Section 2 as justifying the states disenfranchising felons. In \"Hunter v. Underwood\" (1985), a case involving disenfranchising black misdemeanants, the Supreme Court concluded that the Tenth Amendment cannot save legislation prohibited by the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment. More specifically the Court concluded that laws passed with a discriminatory purpose are not excepted from the operation of the Equal Protection Clause by the \"other crime\" provision of Section 2. The Court held that Section 2 \"was not designed to permit the purposeful racial discrimination [...] which otherwise violates [Section] 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nAbolitionist leaders criticized the amendment's failure to specifically prohibit the states from denying people the right to vote on the basis of race.\n\nSection 2 protects the right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only provision of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex. Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil rights from women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.\n\nSection 3 prohibits the election or appointment to any federal or state office of any person who had held any of certain offices and then engaged in insurrection, rebellion, or treason. However, a two-thirds vote by each House of the Congress can override this limitation. In 1898, the Congress enacted a general removal of Section 3's limitation. In 1975, the citizenship of Confederate general Robert E. Lee was restored by a joint congressional resolution, retroactive to June 13, 1865. In 1978, pursuant to Section 3, the Congress posthumously removed the service ban from Confederate president Jefferson Davis.\n\nSection 3 was used to prevent Socialist Party of America member Victor L. Berger, convicted of violating the Espionage Act for his anti-militarist views, from taking his seat in the House of Representatives in 1919 and 1920.\n\nSection 4 confirmed the legitimacy of all public debt appropriated by the Congress. It also confirmed that neither the United States nor any state would pay for the loss of slaves or debts that had been incurred by the Confederacy. For example, during the Civil War several British and French banks had lent large sums of money to the Confederacy to support its war against the Union. In \"Perry v. United States\" (1935), the Supreme Court ruled that under Section 4 voiding a United States bond \"went beyond the congressional power.\"\n\nThe debt-ceiling crises of 2011 and 2013 raised the question of what is the President's authority under Section 4. Some, such as legal scholar Garrett Epps, fiscal expert Bruce Bartlett and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, have argued that a debt ceiling may be unconstitutional and therefore void as long as it interferes with the duty of the government to pay interest on outstanding bonds and to make payments owed to pensioners (that is, Social Security and Railroad Retirement Act recipients). Legal analyst Jeffrey Rosen has argued that Section 4 gives the President unilateral authority to raise or ignore the national debt ceiling, and that if challenged the Supreme Court would likely rule in favor of expanded executive power or dismiss the case altogether for lack of standing. Erwin Chemerinsky, professor and dean at University of California, Irvine School of Law, has argued that not even in a \"dire financial emergency\" could the President raise the debt ceiling as \"there is no reasonable way to interpret the Constitution that [allows him to do so]\". Jack Balkin, Knight Professor of Constitutional Law at Yale University, opined that like Congress the President is bound by the Fourteenth Amendment, for otherwise, he could violate any part of the amendment at will. Because the President must obey the Section 4 requirement not to put the validity of the public debt into question, Balkin argued that President Obama is obliged \"to prioritize incoming revenues to pay the public debt: interest on government bonds and any other 'vested' obligations. What falls into the latter category is not entirely clear, but a large number of other government obligations—and certainly payments for future services—would not count and would have to be sacrificed. This might include, for example, Social Security payments.\"\n\nSection 5, also known as the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, enables Congress to pass laws enforcing the amendment's other provisions. In the \"Civil Rights Cases\" (1883), the Supreme Court interpreted Section 5 narrowly, stating that \"the legislation which Congress is authorized to adopt in this behalf is not general legislation upon the rights of the citizen, but corrective legislation\". In other words, the amendment authorizes Congress to pass laws only to combat violations of the rights protected in other sections.\n\nIn \"Katzenbach v. Morgan\" (1966), the Court upheld Section 4(e) of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits certain forms of literacy requirements as a condition to vote, as a valid exercise of Congressional power under Section 5 to enforce the Equal Protection Clause. The Court ruled that Section 5 enabled Congress to act both remedially and prophylactically to protect the rights guaranteed by the amendment. However, in \"City of Boerne v. Flores\" (1997), the Court narrowed Congress's enforcement power, holding that Congress may not enact legislation under Section 5 that substantively defines or interprets Fourteenth Amendment rights. The Court ruled that legislation is valid under Section 5 only if there is a \"congruence and proportionality\" between the injury to a person's Fourteenth Amendment right and the means Congress adopted to prevent or remedy that injury.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

Referred to as the \"Blue Ribbon\" of aeronautics, the first race started from Paris, France, on September 30, 1906. The event was sponsored by James Gordon Bennett, Jr., the millionaire sportsman and owner of the \"New York Herald\" newspaper. According to the organizers, the aim of the contest \"is simple: to fly the furthest distance from the launch site.\" The contest ran from 1906 to 1938, interrupted by World War I and in 1931, but was suspended in 1939 when the hosts, Poland, were invaded at the start of World War II. The event was not resurrected until 1979, when American Tom Heinsheimer, an atmospheric physicist, gained permission from the holders to host the trophy. The competition was not officially reinstated by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) until 1983.\n\nThe record time for the winner of the event is held by Germans Wilhelm Eimers and Bernd Landsmann who remained airborne for over 92 hours in the 1995 race, taking off from Switzerland and landing four days later in Latvia.

The most successful pilot is French Vincent Leys who won the trophy nine times between 1997 and 2017, while American teams have won on the most occasions, with twelve victories.\n\nThe 2010 competition started in the United Kingdom, with the balloons departing from Bristol on September 25. The race was marred by the disappearance of the American team during a storm over the Adriatic Sea on October 1. The balloon was missing until December 6, when a fishing vessel found the cabin containing the pilots' bodies off the coast of Italy. The 2013 event, departing from France and landing in Portugal, was again won by the French in \"F-PPGB\".\n\nAccording to the official rules, the competition is open to all National Aero Clubs (NACs) \"who have met their obligations to the FAI\", with each NAC being allowed to enter up to three teams whose pilots are of the same nationality as the NAC. Before this, only two teams from any single NAC were permitted to compete in a single competition. Pilots should have at least 50 hours experience as pilot in command and be authorized for night-time flying. At least one member of each team must be capable of communicating with Air Traffic Control in English.\n\nThe team who wins the contest receives the Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett trophy and the team's NAC will hold the contest two years later (originally the winning NAC would host the competition the following year). Any NAC winning the cup in three consecutive races will be the final holder of the cup with the subsequent option to offer a new cup.\n\nResurrected in 1979 by American Tom Heinsheimer, the competition was held without official FAI sanction for four years. Ben Abruzzo and Maxie Anderson secured victory piloting Double Eagle III in 47 hours from California to Colorado. The following year, the winning team of Jerry Tepper and Corky Myers floated from the takeoff point in California. The 1981 race was won again by Abruzzo, with different co-pilot Rocky Aoki, who covered before touching down, while the 1982 race was won by Joe Kittinger and Charles Knapp who piloted Rosie O'Grady . Heinsheimer attempted to gain the copyright over the name \"Gordon Bennett\" and run the event without FAI sanction. However the FAI were granted exclusive rights to the name in 1983, and the organization officially reinstated the competition later that year. Heinsheimer went on to arrange further contests in the United States which were still reported in the national press as being the \"Gordon Bennett Balloon Race\" or similar.\n\nThe 1908 race in Berlin saw the fall of the balloon Conqueror, flown by A. Holland Forbes and Augustus Post. Conqueror was the largest balloon entered in the race, standing 80 feet high and with a gas capacity of 80,000 cubic feet. Before the race Forbes had attempted to lengthen the balloon's appendix to give the team a strategic advantage. Instead the balloon hit a fence just after take off, lost two ballast bags, ascended rapidly and ripped open three minutes into the race. The pair slashed off ballast as they fell 3,000 feet. Their descent was slowed only as the balloon's fabric caught in the netting and formed a rough parachute. They took hold of the ring above them and lifted their feet as the basket smashed through the tiled roof of a house in the Berlin suburb of Friedenau. Both the men and their instruments survived intact. \n\nThe winners of the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup, Alan R. Hawley and Augustus Post, set a distance and duration record of 1,173 miles in 44 hours and 25 minutes, but the pair of experienced balloonists landed in a remote section of Canadian wilderness in Quebec. After a week passed with no word from the team, search parties were formed by the Aero Club of America, but many newspapers reported that the men were likely dead. Instead they emerged after ten days, assisted by two local trappers who had been out on a hunting trip and happened to run into them. Hawley had injured a knee, but otherwise the pair were unharmed and received a hero's welcome upon their safe return.\n\nOn September 23, 1923, five competitors were killed when they were struck by lightning while six more were injured in storms. Among the dead were Lieutenants John W. Choptaw and Robert S. Olmsted who were killed when their balloon \"US Army S6\" crashed in Loosbroek, Netherlands. Sixty years later, in 1983, Americans Maxie Anderson and Don Ida were killed as the gondola detached from their balloon during an attempt to avoid crossing into East German airspace. Anderson and Ida were participating in the \"Coupe Charles et Robert\" (named for Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers, inventors of the gas balloon) which was run in parallel with the Gordon Bennett Cup. Following their deaths, the \"Coupe Charles et Robert\" was never run again.\n\nOn September 12, 1995, three gas balloons participating in the race entered Belarusian air space. Despite the fact that competition organizers had informed the Belarusian Government about the race in May and that flight plans had been filed, a Mil Mi-24B attack helicopter of the Belarusian Air Force shot down one balloon, killing two American citizens, Alan Fraenckel and John Stuart-Jervis. Another of the balloons was forced to land while the third landed safely over two hours after the initial downing. The crews of the two balloons were fined for entering Belarus without a visa and released. Belarus has neither apologized nor offered compensation for the deaths.\n\nOn September 29, 2010, the 2004 trophy-winning American team of Richard Abruzzo and Carol Rymer Davis went missing in thunderstorms over the Adriatic Sea. On September 30, the USA retrieval crew suggested that the balloon may have ditched in the sea or have been destroyed by lightning. Debris was found on October 1 by search crews but race control determined that it was not from the missing balloon. Despite this, organizers later stated that the final calculated rate of descent of the balloon had been about , and that the team's survival was \"unlikely\". The search for the missing pair was called off on October 4. The balloon's cabin containing the bodies was recovered by an Italian fishing boat on December 6.\n\nKey\n\nRecord breaking flights are denoted by the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

The show, like all of CMLL's major shows took place in Arena México, Mexico City, Mexico, CMLL's home venue, nicknamed \"the Cathedral of Lucha Libre\". The 2017 event was the 23rd event in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas series of shows. The event paid homage to CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth, who is always honored at \"Dos Leyendas\", as well as Arturo Díaz Mendoza, better known under the ring name Villano III.\n\nThe main event of the show was a \"Lucha de Apuestas\", or bet match, where Diamante Azul defeated Pierroth, forcing Pierroth to unmask after the loss.. The Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr) defend the CMLL World Trios Championship against Los Hijos del Infierno (Luciferno and Mephisto) and Hechicero. Último Guerrero successfully defended the NWA World Historic Middleweight Championship against Matt Taven.\n\nSince 1996 the Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \"World Wrestling Council\"; CMLL) has held a show in March each year to commemorate the passing of CMLL founder Salvador Lutteroth who died in March 1987. For the first three years the show paid homage to Lutteroth himself, from 1999 through 2004 the show paid homage to Lutteroth and El Santo, Mexico's most famous wrestler ever and from 2005 forward the show has paid homage to Lutteroth and a different \"leyenda\" (\"Legend\") each year, celebrating the career and accomplishments of past CMLL stars. Originally billed as Homenaje a Salvador Lutteroth, it has been held under the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\"Homage to two legends\") since 1999 and is the only show outside of CMLL's Anniversary shows that CMLL has presented every year since its inception. All Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows have been held in Arena México in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \"home\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2017 show was the 23rd overall Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show produced by CMLL.\n\nThe event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as \"rudos\" in Mexico, those that portray the \"bad guys\") or faces (\"técnicos\" in Mexico, the \"good guy\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nIn September 1933 Salvador Lutteroth González founded Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (EMLL), which would later be renamed Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Over time Lutteroth would become responsible for building both Arena Coliseo in Mexico City and Arena Mexico, which became known as \"The Cathedral of Lucha Libre\". Over time EMLL became the oldest wrestling promotion in the world, with 2018 marking the 85th year of its existence. Lutteroth has often been credited with being the \"father of Lucha Libre\" introducing the concept of masked wrestlers to Mexico as well as the \"Luchas de Apuestas\" match. Lutteroth died on September 5, 1987. EMLL, late CMLL, remained under the ownership and control of the Lutteroth family as first Salvador's son Chavo Lutteroth and later his grandson Paco Alonso took over ownership of the company.\n\nThe life and achievements of Salvador Lutteroth is always honored at the annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show, since 1999 CMLL has also honored a second person, a \"Leyenda\" of lucha libre, in some ways CMLL's version of their Hall of Fame. In 2017 CMLL chose to honor Arturo Díaz Mendoza, best known under the ring name Villano III (\"Villain 3\") for his life and career in Lucha Libre. Arturo Mendoza was the middle son of wrestler/promoter Ray Mendoza, following José de Jesús Díaz Mendoza (aka. Villano I) and José Alfredo Díaz Mendoz (Villano II) and younger brothers Raymundo Díaz Mendoza Jr. (Villano V) and Tomas Díaz Mendoza (Villano V). His career really took off when Ray Mendoza, Francisco Flores and Benjamin Mora Jr. broke away from CMLL to form the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) where Arturo became one of the stars of their lighter weight divisions holding the UWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship, the UWA World Junior Light Heavyweight Championship, the UWA World Light Heavyweight Championship twice, the UWA World Welterweight Championship and the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship 7 times. Over the years Villano III defended his mask in a multitude of \"Luchas de Apuestas\" matches, with more than 30 mask wins on his record, including unmasking Super Astro and Pegasus Kid. In late-1999/early-2000 Villano III started a storyline feud with Atlantis that led to both wrestlers putting their mask on the line at the 2000 Juicio Final. Villano III lost the match and his mask in what was voted as the Wrestling Observer Match of the Year for 2001. In subsequent years Arturo's career slowed down as age and injuries took a toll on him. He finally retired in 2015 due to diminishing eyesight and deteriorating knees.\n"}
{"id": "9624647", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9624647", "title": "Internal conflict in Peru", "text": "Internal conflict in Peru\n\nThe internal conflict in Peru is an ongoing armed conflict between the Government of Peru, the Communist Party of Peru (better known as \"Shining Path\" or \"PCP-SL\"), and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement. The conflict began on May 17, 1980. Estimates indicate that there have been nearly 70,000 deaths, making it the bloodiest war in Peruvian history since the European colonization of the country. \n\nThe high death toll includes many civilian casualties resulting from deliberate targeting by many factions. Recently, however, the conflict has become dormant as the number of deaths dropped significantly since the year 2000. There were low-level resurgences of violence in 2002 and 2014 when conflict erupted between the Peruvian Army and guerrilla remnants in the VRAEM region. The conflict has lasted for over 38 years, making it the second longest internal conflict in the history of Latin America, after the Colombian armed conflict.\n\nPrior to the conflict, Peru had undergone a series of coups with frequent switches between different parties and ideologies. On October 2, 1968, General Juan Velasco Alvarado staged a military coup and became Peru's 56th president under the administration of the Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, a left-leaning military dictatorship. Following a period of widespread poverty and unemployment, Velasco himself was overthrown by a bloodless military coup on August 29, 1975, and was replaced by Francisco Morales Bermúdez as the new President of Peru.\n\nMorales made an announcement that his rule would provide a \"Second Phase\" to the previous administration which would bring great political and economic reform to the country. However, he was unsuccessful in delivering on his promises and in 1978 a Constitutional Assembly was created to replace Peru's 1933 Constitution. Morales then proclaimed that national elections would be held by 1980. Elections were held for the Constituent Assembly on June 18, 1978, martial law was imposed on January 6, 1979, and the Assembly approved the new constitution in July 1979. On May 18, 1980 Fernando Belaunda Terry was elected president. During the years between February 1966 and July 1980 about 500 people died in political violence. \n\nMany affiliated with Peru's Communist Party had opposed the creation of the new constitution and formed the extremist organization known as the \"Shining Path\". This ultimately led to the beginning of Peru's internal conflict, with the first attacks taking place only a day before the elections. Despite this, national elections continued and Fernando Belaúnde Terry was elected as the 58th President of Peru in 1980. Terry had already served as the country's 55th president prior to Velasco's coup in 1968.\n\nDuring the governments of Velasco and Morales, Shining Path had been organized as a Maoist political group based at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University in the Ayacucho Region. It was founded in 1970, and led by Abimael Guzmán, a communist professor of philosophy at the San Cristóbal of Huamanga University. Guzmán had been inspired by the Cultural Revolution, which he had witnessed first-hand during a trip to China. Shining Path members engaged in street fights with members of other political groups and painted graffiti exhorting \"armed struggle\" against the Peruvian state.\n\nWhen Peru's military government allowed elections for the first time in a dozen years in 1980, Shining Path was one of the few leftist political groups that declined to take part, instead opting to launch guerrilla warfare actions against the state in the highlands of the province of Ayacucho. On May 17, 1980, the eve of the presidential elections, they burned ballot boxes in the town of Chuschi, Ayacucho. It was the first \"act of terrorism\" by Shining Path. Nonetheless, the perpetrators were quickly caught and additional ballots were brought in to replace the burned ballots; the elections proceeded without any further incidents with the act receiving very little attention in the Peruvian press.\n\nShining Path opted to fight in the style taught by Mao Zedong. They would open up \"guerrilla zones\" in which their guerrillas could operate and drive government forces out of these zones to create \"liberated zones.\" These zones would then be used to support new guerrilla zones until the entire country was essentially one big \"liberated zone.\" Shining Path also adhered to Mao's teaching that guerrilla should be fought primarily in the countryside and gradually choke off the cities.\n\nOn December 3, 1982, the Shining Path officially formed a \"People's Guerrilla Army\", its armed wing.\n\nIn 1982, the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) launched its own guerrilla against the Peruvian state. The group had been formed by remnants of the Movement of the Revolutionary Left in Peru and identified with Castroite guerrilla movements in other parts of Latin America. The MRTA used techniques that were more traditional to Latin American leftist organizations than those used by Shining Path. For example, the MRTA wore uniforms, claimed to be fighting for true democracy and complained of human rights abuses by the state, while Shining Path did not wear uniforms and had little regard for the democratic process and human rights.\n\nDuring the conflict, the MRTA and Shining Path engaged in combat with each other. The MRTA played a small part in the overall conflict, being declared by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to have been responsible for 1.5% of deaths accumulated throughout the conflict. At its height, the MRTA was believed to have consisted of only a few hundred members.\n\nGradually, the Shining Path committed more and more violent attacks on the National Police of Peru and the Lima-based government could no longer ignore the growing crisis in the Andes. In 1981, Fernando Belaúnde Terry declared a State of Emergency and ordered that the Peruvian Armed Forces fight the Shining Path. Constitutional rights were suspended for 60 days in Huamanga Province, Huanta Province, Cangallo Province, La Mar Province and Víctor Fajardo Province. Later, the Armed Forces created the Ayacucho Emergency Zone, in which military power was superior to civilian power, and many constitutional rights were suspended. The military committed many human rights violations in the area where it had political control, including the infamous Accomarca massacre. Scores of peasants were massacred by the armed forces. A special US-trained \"counter terrorist\" police battalion known as the \"Sinchis\" were particularly notorious in the '80s for their human rights violations.\n\nThe reaction of the Shining Path to the Peruvian government's use of the military in the conflict was not to back down, but instead to ramp up the level of violence in the countryside. Shining Path attacked police officers, soldiers, and civilians that it considered to be \"class enemies\", often using particularly gruesome methods of killing their victims. These killings, along with Shining Path's disrespect for the culture of indigenous peasants it claimed to represent, turned many people in the sierra away from the group.\n\nFaced with a hostile population, the Shining Path's guerrilla began to falter. In some areas, some fearful, well-off peasants formed anti-Shining Path patrols, called \"rondas\". They were generally poorly equipped, despite donations of guns from the armed forces. Nevertheless, Shining Path guerrillas were militarily attacked by the \"rondas\". The first such reported attack was in January 1983 near Huata, where some \"rondas\" killed 13 guerrillas; in February in Sacsamarca, \"rondas\" stabbed and killed the Shining Path commanders of that area. In March 1983, \"rondas\" brutally killed Olegario Curitomay, one of the commanders of the town of Lucanamarca. They took him to the town square, stoned him, stabbed him, set him on fire and finally, shot him. As a response, in April, Shining Path entered the province of Huancasancos and the towns of Yanaccollpa, Ataccara, Llacchua, Muylacruz, and Lucanamarca and killed 69 people, many of whom were children, including one who was only six months old. Also killed were several women, some of them pregnant. Most of them died by machete hacks and some were shot at close range in the head. This was the first massacre committed by Shining Path against the peasant community. Other incidents followed, such as the one in Hauyllo, Tambo District, La Mar Provinceand Ayacucho Department. In that community, Shining Path killed 47 peasants, including 14 children aged four to fifteen.\n\nAdditional massacres by Shining Path occurred, such as one in Marcas on August 29, 1985.\n\nThe Shining Path, like the government, filled its ranks by conscription. The Shining Path also kidnapped children and forced them to fight as child soldiers in their actions.\n\nUnder the administration of Alberto Fujimori the state started its widespread use of intelligence agencies in its fight against Shining Path. Some atrocities were allegedly committed by the National Intelligence Service, notably the La Cantuta massacre, the Barrios Altos massacre and the Santa massacre.\n\nOn April 5, 1992, Fujimori dissolved the Congress of Peru and abolished the Constitution, initiating the Peruvian Constitutional Crisis of 1992. The reason for these actions was that the Congress was slow to pass anti-terrorism legislation. Fujimori set up military courts to try suspected members of the Shining Path and MRTA, and ordered that an \"iron fist\" approach be used. Fujimori also announced that Peru would no longer be under the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.\n\nAs Shining Path began to lose ground in the Andes to the Peruvian state and the rondas, it decided to speed up its overall strategic plan. Shining Path declared that it had reached \"strategic equilibrium\" and was ready to begin its final assault on the cities of Peru. In 1992, Shining Path set off a powerful bomb in the Miraflores District of Lima in what became known as the Tarata bombing. This was part of a larger bombing campaign to follow suit in Lima.\nOn September 12, 1992, Peruvian police captured Guzmán and several Shining Path leaders in an apartment above a dance studio in the Surquillo district of Lima. The police had been monitoring the apartment, as a number of suspected Shining Path militants had visited it. An inspection of the garbage of the apartment produced empty tubes of a skin cream used to treat psoriasis, a condition that Guzmán was known to have. Shortly after the raid that captured Guzmán, most of the remaining Shining Path leadership fell as well. At the same time, Shining Path suffered embarrassing military defeats to peasant self-defense organizations – supposedly its social base – and the organization fractured into splinter groups.\n\nGuzmán's role as the leader of Shining Path was taken over by Óscar Ramírez, who himself was captured by Peruvian authorities in 1999. After Ramírez's capture, the group splintered, guerrilla activity diminished sharply and previous conditions returned to the areas where the Shining Path had been active. Some Shining Path and MRTA remnants managed to stage minor scale attacks, such as the January 1993 wave of attacks and political assassinations that occurred in the run-up to the municipal elections, which also targeted US interests; these included the bombing of two Coca-Cola plants on January 22 (by Shining Path); the RPG attack against the USIS Binational Center on January 16; the bombing of a KFC restaurant on January 21 (both by the MRTA) and the car-bombing of the Peruvian headquarters of IBM on January 28 (by Shining Path). On July 27, 1993, Shining Path militants drove a car bomb into the US Embassy in Lima, which left extensive damage on the complex (worth some USD$250.000) and nearby buildings.\n\nShining Path confined to their former headquarters in the Peruvian jungle and continued smaller attacks against the military, like the one that occurred on October 2, 1999, when a Peruvian Army helicopter was shot down by SP guerrillas near Satipo (killing 5) and stealing a PKM machine gun which was reportedly used in another attack against an Mi-17 in July 2003.\n\nDespite Shining Path being mostly defeated, more that 25% of Peru's national territory remained under a state of emergency until early 2000.\n\nAlberto Fujimori resigned the Presidency in 2000, but Congress declared him \"morally unfit\", installing the opposite congress member Valentín Paniagua into office. He rescinded Fujimori's announcement that Peru would leave the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (CVR) to investigate the conflict. The commission was headed by the President of Catholic University Salomón Lerner Febres. The Commission found in its 2003 \"Final Report\" that 69,280 people died or disappeared between 1980 and 2000 as a result of the armed conflict. A statistical analysis of the available data led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to estimate that the Shining Path was responsible for the death or disappearance of 31,331 people, 45% of the total deaths and disappearances. According to a summary of the report by Human Rights Watch, \"Shining Path... killed about half the victims, and roughly one-third died at the hands of government security forces... The commission attributed some of the other slayings to a smaller guerrilla group and local militias. The rest remain unattributed.\" According to its final report, 75% of the people who were either killed or disappeared spoke Quechua as their native language, despite the fact that the 1993 census found that only 20% of Peruvians speak Quechua or another indigenous language as their native language.\n\nNevertheless, the final report of the CVR was surrounded by controversy. It was criticized by almost all political parties (including former Presidents Fujimori, García and Paniagua), the military and the Catholic Church, which claimed that many of the Commission members were former members of extreme leftists movements and that the final report wrongfully portrayed Shining Path and the MRTA as \"political parties\" rather than as terrorist organizations, even though, for example, Shining Path has been clearly designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, the European Union, and Canada.\n\n\n"}

Each side believes the other to be controlled by foreign elements, the JLP is said to be backed by the American Central Intelligence Agency and the PNP is said to been backed by the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro.\n\nBy 1943 the JLP and PNP had established themselves as Jamaica's main rival political parties coming out of the recent Caribbean labor unrest. After the election of 1944 violence became a common aspect of their rivalry. Alexander Bustamante began to encourage the attack of PNP sympathizers, claiming they were communists.\n\nPolitical violence had become commonplace in Jamaica. Political parties began paying off crime bosses for local gang support. Assassination threats and attempts also starting becoming more frequent. Sporadic political violence would evolve into outright urban warfare after a series of violent outbursts. The Henry rebellion, the Coral Gardens uprising, the anti-Chinese riots of 1965, the state of emergency of 1966-67, and finally the Rodney riots. These events sparked an emerging ethnic nationalist element to the political conflict and increased partisan warfare.\n\nBy the 1976 election over a hundred had been murdered during the conflict and political parties began forming paramilitary divisions.

As commander of No. 24 Squadron, based in New Britain, he became famous in the annals of Air Force history for his irreverent response to orders by headquarters in Australia during the Battle of Rabaul in January 1942. After his squadron was directed to assist in repelling the invading Japanese fleet with its one serviceable bomber, and to keep its damaged airfield open, Lerew signalled headquarters with the ancient Latin phrase supposedly used by gladiators honouring their Emperor: \"Morituri vos salutamus\" (\"We who are about to die salute you\"). He also defied an order to abandon his staff, and organised their escape from Rabaul.\n\nIn February 1942, Lerew led a low-level bombing raid on enemy shipping in New Guinea that set two vessels on fire. He was shot down but managed to evade capture, and returned to safety nine days after being reported missing. Awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, he subsequently commanded the RAAF's first flying safety directorate. After leaving the Air Force in 1946 as a group captain, Lerew took up a position with the newly formed ICAO in Canada. He was responsible for several of its administrative and technical reforms, and rose to Chief of Flight Branch in 1969. Retiring from ICAO in 1972, he travelled extensively before settling in Vancouver, where he died in 1996 at the age of eighty-three.\n\nBorn in Hamilton, Victoria, Lerew was the son of William Margrave Lerew, a chemist and veterinary surgeon who had emigrated from England with his two brothers. The family was of French \"Huguenot\" extraction, the original name being \"Le Roux\". John Lerew was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne, where he was a member of the cadets. He studied part-time for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Melbourne, concurrently serving approximately two years in the militia with various units including the 39th Battalion, 3rd Division Artillery Survey Unit, and Melbourne University Regiment. He also developed a love of fast cars, joining a racing team and placing third in the 1930 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nOn 19 November 1932, Lerew enlisted as an air cadet in the RAAF active reserve, known as the Citizen Air Force (CAF). He had marched into Victoria Barracks on a whim and asked to see the person in charge of Air Force recruiting. He was shown to the office of Squadron Leader Raymond Brownell, also a former Scotch College boy, who admitted him. Lerew undertook flying instruction on the 1933 'B' course conducted by No. 1 Squadron at RAAF Station Laverton, and was commissioned a pilot officer on 1 April. He transferred from the CAF to the Permanent Air Force on 20 May 1935, following graduation from university, and was promoted flying officer on 1 July. Posted to No. 1 Aircraft Depot, he was raised to probationary flight lieutenant in 1936. The rank became substantive the following year, when he was appointed Staff Officer Directorate of Works and Buildings at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, responsible for selection and improvement of airfield sites.\n\nLerwe was still based in Melbourne when World War II broke out in September 1939. He was promoted squadron leader in June 1940, and the same month took charge of No. 1 Aircraft Park in Geelong. One of his initial tasks was to test fly the first Fairey Battle single-engined light bomber assembled in Australia. He was posted to No. 2 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, in September 1940, and shortly afterwards undertook a survey of the Solomon Islands and the island of New Britain, including its capital Rabaul. Lerew was given command of No. 24 Squadron in May 1941, and raised to temporary wing commander in October.\n\nNo. 24 Squadron's complement in November 1941 consisted of one Fairey Battle, three De Havilland Moth Minor biplane trainers, five Lockheed Hudson twin-engined light bombers, and eleven CAC Wirraway monoplane trainers. The two-seat Wirraways were expected to be employed in operations as fighters, but were suitable for such a role \"only in the minds of the Air Board\", in the words of RAAF historian Alan Stephens. On 1 December, RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne put Lerew's squadron on notice for deployment to Rabaul as an advance garrison in the defence of northern Australia.\nNo. 24 Squadron's Hudsons began moving to Vunakanau airfield, Rabaul, from RAAF Station Townsville in far-north Queensland on 5 December 1941. By the middle of the month they had been joined by the unit's Wirraways. Vunakanau afforded little shelter for staff or aircraft, and Japanese reconnaissance planes were already active in the vicinity, suggesting an attack was imminent. No. 24 Squadron began carrying out reconnaissance missions with its Hudsons, and on one occasion attempted to bomb an enemy ship without success. RAAF Headquarters threatened to relieve Lerew for his apparent lack of results and delays in communications, and demanded to know his excuses. Possessed of what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as an \"impish irreverence\", Lerew listed among his reasons \"disappointment in the lack of assistance rendered by the Almighty\". He later reported that he was being caused \"more worry\" by his own headquarters in \"the south than from the enemy situated in the north\".\nNo. 24 Squadron's strength at the beginning of 1942 was four Hudsons, six Wirraways, and 130 staff. On New Year's Day, Lerew led the Hudsons on a raid against Kapingamarangi Island, igniting a fuel dump that was still burning when the squadron returned to follow up the attack two days later. During 4–7 January, Vunakanau airfield suffered four raids by unescorted Japanese bombers, destroying all but one of the Hudsons. Although the Wirraways were scrambled to intercept attackers on several occasions, their rate of climb was so poor that only once did one of them manage to engage an enemy seaplane, without result; this action, on 6 January, was the first air-to-air combat between RAAF and Japanese forces. At this point, Lerew signalled headquarters for six \"modern fighters\" with which to defend his airfield; none were forthcoming.\n\nSquadron Leader Arch Tindal, Northern Area Command Armaments Officer, added his weight to Lerew's pleas for modern aircraft. Tindal had arrived to inspect No. 24 Squadron in the middle of an enemy attack on 3 January, and immediately leapt into the nearest Wirraway to attempt an interception. He later submitted a report to headquarters at Townsville, echoing Lerew's concerns regarding the Wirraway's capabilities and warning that \"Rabaul is now wide open to bombing attack\". Despite this, morale remained high in the unit; Lerew remarked on the devil-may-care attitude of his personnel, who frequently waited until the last moment to take cover during air raids. On 17 January, Lerew was able to gain sufficient height in his Wirraway to confront a Japanese seaplane in a head-on attack, but his .303 machine-gun ammunition was not sufficient to bring it down. In 1956, while at a conference in Tokyo, he coincidentally met the Japanese plane's pilot, who informed him that his lone assault had damaged an engine and killed two crewmen, adding that Lerew was \"the bravest enemy I ever faced\".\n\nOn 20 January, a force of over 100 Japanese aircraft, comprising bombers, dive bombers and fighter escort, converged on Rabaul. It was led by Commander Mitsuo Fuchida, who had controlled the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Two patrolling Wirraways of No. 24 Squadron attacked the first wave of Japanese raiders. Lerew's six remaining Wirraways then scrambled, one crashing on take-off. Of the seven that were airborne, three were shot down into the sea by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, two others crash landed with severe damage, one escaped with minor damage, and one remained unscathed. The ten-minute action killed six RAAF aircrew and wounded five. An Australian soldier on the ground later recalled, \"We sat at our guns, shocked by the massacre we had just observed\". The Japanese fighters compounded the humiliation by executing aerobatics over the bombed airfield. Lerew signalled headquarters, \"Two Wirraways useless defence. Will you now please send some fighters?\", receiving the reply, \"Regret inability to supply fighters. If we had them you would get them.\" The next day he was ordered to attack the approaching Japanese fleet with \"all available aircraft\". As his two serviceable Wirraways had no bomb racks, this left only the one remaining Hudson with which to execute the order; it duly took off to search for the enemy ships but was unable to locate them by nightfall, and returned to base.\n\nIt was following a further directive from headquarters on 21 January 1942 to keep his airfield \"open\", that Lerew, after discussion with his intelligence staff, sent the signal that made him famous: \"Morituri vos salutamus\". The message flummoxed headquarters, until an officer familiar with Latin decoded it as the legendary phrase used by ancient gladiators to honour their Emperor: \"We who are about to die salute you!\" Lerew also chose to ignore two other orders received from headquarters, firstly to turn his remaining ground staff and aircrew into infantrymen to assist with the army's defence and secondly to leave Rabaul in his remaining Hudson to take command of a new squadron in Port Moresby, New Guinea. To the first order he replied that trained RAAF crews would be more valuable in future actions than in a last-ditch effort to repel the invader at Rabaul; to the second he simply turned a \"blind eye\", refusing to escape alone in the only aircraft left that could evacuate his personnel. On 22 January, he sent off ninety-six staff in the Hudson and in flying boats called in from Port Moresby. Others escaped overland or in boats; Lerew's careful planning helped ensure that only three of his men were captured by the Japanese.\n\nFollowing the evacuation of Rabaul, Lerew took command of a composite squadron in Port Moresby which later became No. 32 (General Reconnaissance) Squadron. On 11 February 1942, he led a flight of three Hudsons in a raid on Gasmata harbour, making what the official history of the RAAF in World War II described as \"the first mast-height attack on enemy shipping in the New Guinea campaign\". Having set two ships on fire, the Hudsons were attacked by enemy fighters and two were shot down, including Lerew's. With his aircraft in flames, he ordered his crew to bail out of the rear hatch while he parachuted from the front window. Lerew landed in the jungle and narrowly avoided capture before making his way to a Coastwatcher post and returning to Port Moresby in a schooner, nine days after having been posted missing; his crew members had died. On 7 April, Lerew was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for \"outstanding courage, determination, skill and tenacity in the course of bombing raids on enemy positions in New Britain\". The success of the Gasmata operation prompted the Chief of the Air Staff to commend Lerew's squadron for the \"effort required by both crews and ground personnel owing to our small numbers and general condition\".\nReturning to Australia, Lerew held various base commands including RAAF Station Townsville, RAAF Station Nowra in New South Wales, and Batchelor Airfield near Darwin, Northern Territory. He led No. 7 Squadron, operating Bristol Beauforts out of first Nowra and then Townsville, from August to December 1942. He then returned to RAAF Station Laverton to take charge of No. 1 Aircraft Depot (No. 1 AD). Lerew's biographer, Lex McAulay, speculated of this quick succession of postings across the country: \"...it is easy to assume that this Wing Commander whose critical reports were seen by the War Cabinet, and who had twice escaped the enemy at close quarters, was not to be allowed personal contact with the media of the day until his experiences were no longer topical and were overtaken by more recent momentous events\". Though degree-qualified in civil engineering, Lerew believed he was underused in the technical environment of No. 1 AD, and sought another overseas posting. Nevertheless, his tenure at Laverton helped prepare him for his later flying safety work. In September 1943, he investigated the crash of a Vultee Vengeance flown by an experienced aviator, and found that when rolling the aircraft to the right it was possible for the pilot's movements to release his safety harness, making it impossible for him to remain in his seat and control the aircraft. Lerew designed and developed a clip to prevent a recurrence of this mishap, which was later adopted worldwide for all such harnesses.\n\nLerew was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters, London, in December 1943. He travelled via the United States, meeting film stars Bing Crosby, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour on the set of \"Road to Utopia\" at Los Angeles in February 1944. In London, he undertook study of RAF and USAAF methods of operations, as well as diplomatic duties. Of the invasion of France on 6 June 1944, he wrote: \"There has been no rejoicing. A hushed quietness has descended over London and all of England. Most people have relatives in it, and there is only one wish: that is, that it will end quickly. It is depressing to be playing no part in it.\" Later in the year, Lerew was invested with his Distinguished Flying Cross by King George VI at Buckingham Palace. He returned to Australia in early 1945, and married Laurie Steele, the Australian-born widow of a Royal Air Force night-fighter pilot, having met her when he was stationed in England. The couple had two daughters, but eventually divorced. In March, Lerew took part in the investigation into the crash of a Hudson carrying Major General George Vasey; he determined that the pilot's lack of experience in instrument flying had been a factor, and recommended further such training for RAAF flight crew. Promoted group captain, he formed the Directorate of Flying Safety in June 1945 and served as its inaugural Director. Believing that the promotion of flying safety in the RAAF cut across both administrative and operational spheres, and aware of the notorious feud between the service's two senior officers, Air Vice Marshals George Jones and Bill Bostock, Lerew had proposed that the new directorate be placed squarely under the auspices of Jones as Chief of the Air Staff, with authority to demand free access to information from all other directorates.\n\nDubious about the prospects for advancement in the post-war military, Lerew applied for a role in the recently established Provisional International Civil Aviation Organization (PICAO) in March 1946, while still Director of Flying Safety in the RAAF. He had just been appointed Air Officer Commanding North-Western Area in Darwin on 7 October 1946 when PICAO offered him the position of Technical Officer, which he accepted. He left the RAAF on 8 November 1946, emigrating to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, to take up his new employment with PICAO, which became ICAO in 1947. Appointed Chief of Aerodromes, Air Routes and Ground Aids Section in January 1951, he conducted assessments of airfields throughout the world, and led the team that recommended Hellinikon be developed as Athens' international airport. Lerew received credit for several of ICAO's accomplishments over the next decade, including various administrative reforms within the organisation and finalising a standard runway approach lighting system in 1953 following five years of disagreement among members. A colleague remembered him as having \"that very fortunate duality of personality, being serious, efficient and knowledgeable in his official capacity, with an equally inherent twin ability to really liven things up off-duty\".\n\nIn Mexico on 20 August 1966, Lerew married Josephine Henriette Oude Reimerink, a Dutch national he had met three years earlier. He was promoted ICAO's Chief of Flight Branch in April 1969, in which capacity he served until retiring from the organisation in 1972. In retirement, Lerew and his wife restored houses and travelled extensively. Their expeditions resulted in two narrow escapes, in December 1974 when they tired of the oppressively humid weather in Darwin and left just before Cyclone Tracy struck on Christmas Day, and in February 1976 when they decided to camp well away from Lake Atitlan, Guatemala, which was devastated soon after by an earthquake that left over 22,000 people dead. The couple eventually settled in Vancouver, where John Lerew died of cancer on 24 February 1996, aged eighty-three. He was survived by Josephine and the children of his first marriage.\n"}

KFC is the fourth fast food restaurant chain targeted by PETA, following campaigns against McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\n\"KentuckyFriedCruelty.com\" was the legal name of Christopher Garnett, a youth outreach worker for PETA, after he changed his name to protest the treatment of chickens by KFC. At the time of his name change, Garnett was the street team coordinator of peta2, PETA's youth division.\n\nThe PETA website showed a copy of KentuckyFriedCruelty.com's drivers license bearing what was his legal name. PETA member Pamela Anderson expressed her support for the name change, as did his parents, although they continued to call him \"Chris\". Garnett explained in a January 2006 interview with Tucker Carlson:\nPretty much everyone still calls me Chris, some of the people at the office call me Ken or Tuck. But the funny thing about the name change is, regardless of what people call me, every time I go to pay for something, I show someone my ID, I'm able to tell them about how KFC is, you know, cutting the beaks off baby birds and how their workers are slamming chickens in a wall, kicking them like footballs and laughing about it.

{"id": "10753377", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10753377", "title": "MOSAIC threat assessment systems", "text": "MOSAIC threat assessment systems\n\nMOSAIC threat assessment systems (MOSAIC) is a method developed by Gavin de Becker and Associates in the early 1980s to assess and screen threats and inappropriate communications.\n\nWalt Risler of Indiana University assisted in the early development of the method, and Robert Martin, founding commander of the Los Angeles Police Department Threat Management Unit played a role in later development and enhancements. (Martin now heads up the MOSAIC threat assessment Unit at Gavin de Becker & Associates.)\n\nThe first MOSAIC systems were developed before 1992. The computer-assisted MOSAIC method is now used by the Supreme Court Police to assess threats to the Justices, by the U.S. Capitol Police for threats against Members of Congress, by police agencies protecting the governors of eleven states, by many large corporations, and by more than twenty top universities.\n\nThere are different MOSAIC systems for different situations, including:\n\n\nThe MOSAIC method poses a series of questions to users, accompanied by a range of possible answers. For every area of inquiry, the system provides a button for “Premise of the Question” – providing immediate on-screen research citations about why that particular area of inquiry is part of the assessment process. MOSAIC calculates the value of the answers selected by the assessor, and expresses the results on a scale of 1 to 10. Unlike most assessment tools, many of which are paper checklists, MOSAIC automatically produces a full written report, describing the factors that were considered and the selections made by the user.\n\nMOSAIC’s on-line resources include a library of research, publications, and training videos that users can access during an assessment.\n\nMOSAIC for assessing unwanted pursuit of public figures (MAPP) is used by agencies protecting elected and appointed officials, national security agencies, and iconic public figures.\n\nLieutenant Tom Taylor, four-time president of the National Governor’s Security Association, wrote for the Institute of Police Technology and Management:\nThe consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and documents the findings is what sets it apart. In fact, since it places less emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.\nIn the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the United States Marshals Service undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges. He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors. Calhoun felt that these threats – often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court – were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact.\n\nThe marshal's service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun’s research, and Gavin de Becker & Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ).\n\nThe book \"Hunters and Howlers: Threats & Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials\" describes the method that evolved into this MOSAIC:\nBy drawing as complete a mosaic of the threatened and each of his inappropriate communications as possible, de Becker’s system identifies those situations requiring a defensive reaction or a proactive response. The problem is thus managed to the best and least intrusive protection of the victim. The whole approach is informed by an intelligent, comprehensive process of thinking. De Becker’s assessments are the best because he asks the most comprehensive questions, and he consistently asks them of every communication. To do fewer risks more.\nA variation of MAJ is now used by Sheriff’s Deputies, bailiffs, and others tasked to protect judges and other judicial officials.\n\nDV - MOSAIC assesses situations involving domestic violence. As of April 2010, DV - MOSAIC is available at no-cost to the public at www.mosaicmethod.com.\n\nA study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and published by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service found that when compared to two specific instruments, the Domestic Violence Screening Instrument (DSVI) and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID), DV - MOSAIC “performed best in predicting subsequent stalking or threats.” The study also reported that MOSAIC tested highest on “sensitivity,” correctly classifying most of the women that were re-assaulted; had the strongest correlation between the victims’ perception of risk of re-assault and risk of serious harm; captured relevant information equally well with victims of various ethnicities; had scores that were significantly associated with abuse; and provided uniformity of assessment (called Inter-rater Reliability) such that ten different people of different abilities and styles would come up with the same preliminary rating.\n\nA synopsis of the findings is available at https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf.\n\nThe study has also been published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison, The Journal of Interpersonal Violence, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equity, and the Violence Against Women Network.\n\nDV-MOSAIC is used by many police departments around the nation.\n“MOSAIC is proving successful. In the suburbs of Los Angeles where it is used, officials attribute much of the 70% decline in domestic violence to the system.\"\nRobert Ressler, a criminologist who worked in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit for 16 years, has referred federal agencies to de Becker. “It has a futuristic ability to predict crime and has a proven track record,\" Ressler said. \"You can predict a crime and deal with a potential situation based on a reading from a database. It will help law enforcement deal with situations successfully.\"\n\nMOSAIC – workplace violence assesses the three most likely sources of violence in the workplace: angry employees, angry former employees, and stalkers who pursue their targets at the workplace.\n\nThe development of this MOSAIC was guided by an Advisory Board of experts and practitioners from industry, government, and law enforcement.\n\nThis version of MOSAIC is used by professionals in security departments, legal departments, and human resources offices of large organizations, government agencies, and universities.\n\nThe development of MOSAIC for threats by students (MAST) included an exploration into the pre-incident indicators of explosive school violence. The process drew on more than two hundred experts and practitioners from the fields of education, counseling, psychology, parenting, threat assessment, law enforcement, the judiciary, and students.\n\nThe MAST is used by school administrators, counselors, and security/law enforcement officers.\n\nIn 1997, Chief James Perrotti of the Yale University police stated that the department used MOSAIC for assessing threats made to Yale professors. He stated that MOSAIC allowed police to prioritize cases and better allocate their resources.\n\nIn 2007, the Missouri Campus Task Force report to the Governor of Missouri on campus security and violence prevention included the recommendation that “Each institution should thoroughly evaluate the viability and appropriateness of using assessment tools (e.g. MOSAIC) designed to identify individuals with the potential for violent behavior.\"\n\nThe Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education said about MOSAIC: “This is not something where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ This is bringing us to a higher level.\"\n\nIn April 2010, Oprah Winfrey dedicated an hour-long show to applying the MOSAIC method to domestic violence situations. It was announced on the show that Gavin de Becker was making MOSAIC available to anyone at no cost. Tens of thousands of audience members accessed MOSAIC within the first two weeks, and this MOSAIC remains available to anyone today at no cost at www.oprah.com or www.mosaicmethod.com.\n\nIn an article on the method, psychologist Hill Walker, a professor at the University of Oregon who had studied behavioral disorders in schoolchildren for 34 years told Wired Magazine, \"There are some serious validity issues here, some reputation-ruining implications.\" The developers note that Hill Walker has never seen or used a MOSAIC system, and was commenting on the idea or concept, not the actual method. In a letter to the editor following publication of the article, de Becker wrote that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) “is the opposite of profiling in that it is always applied to an actual known individual, and it always explores actual behavior and circumstance.\n\nIn an editorial, Professor Laurence Steinberg (who had never seen MOSAIC) questioned the value of the method for predicting violence:\nIn a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the dozen or so students a year who might commit murder is like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Kansas \n\nDe Becker responded that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) is never applied to the general population of students, and rather just to those students who self-identify by making a threat.\n\nThe NY Times published a letter by de Becker, commenting on Professor Steinberg's editorial.\n\n\n"}

The company is based in Brentwood, Essex. Matchroom has a comprehensive broadcasting agreement in the United Kingdom with Sky Sports.\n\nRecently, it also began sponsoring the football ground of English League Two team Leyton Orient. Previously called Brisbane Road, it has now been renamed the Matchroom Stadium. Barry Hearn used to be Orient's Chairman.\n\nMatchroom Sport entered snooker event management in the 1980s. They had players such as Steve Davis, Dennis Taylor and Jimmy White on their books.\n\nMatchroom Sport is currently the official sponsor of the annual WPA World Nine-ball Championship, the most prestigious professional tournament of its field. After having organised a similar but competing event for one year, the World Professional Pool Championship in Cardiff, Wales, in July 1999, Matchroom merged its tournament with that of the World Pool-Billiard Association in 2000, and the joint event took the promotional name \"World Pool Championship\" (an ambiguous name, since there is also a yearly WPA World Eight-ball Championship held in the United Arab Emirates). The event stayed in Cardiff until 2003, with the 2004 and 2005 events taking place in Taiwan. The 2006 event was held in the Philippines. Despite the moves, the competition has remained very similar in format and staging throughout.\n\nMatchroom's other prestigious pool event is the Mosconi Cup, held each December from 1994 onwards. The event is modelled on the Ryder Cup, and it pits a team of European players against a team from the US. From 2003, the event has alternated between European and American venues, having previous always been held in the UK.\n\nThe Mosconi Cup is notable for having evolved from an exhibition event in the early years, into a genuinely prestigious tournament. Early Mosconi Cup contests were characterised by a team of some of America’s most charismatic players taking on a European team of mainly British snooker players, in an attempt to promote nine-ball in the UK. More recent instances of the event have been fought in a much more serious manner, although the raucous crowd atmosphere has been retained, making it unique among cue sports competitions.\n\nMatchroom has been involved in a revival of the sport of ten-pin bowling which has given the sport a renewed international pop-culture interest.\n\nWith a roster of the world's three major bowling events – the World Tenpin Masters, the Weber Cup and the AMF World Cup – Matchroom Sport has established a successful formula for presenting televised bowling.

The story of the Montauk Project originated in by Preston Nichols which intermixes those stories with stories about the Philadelphia Experiment.\n\nStories about the Montauk Project have circulated since the early 1980s. According to UFO researcher Jacques Vallée, the Montauk Experiment stories seem to have originated with the account of Preston Nichols, who claimed to have recovered repressed memories of his own involvement and claims that he is periodically abducted to continue his participation against his will. Nichols, born May 24, 1946 on Long Island, New York, claims to have degrees in parapsychology, psychology, and electrical engineering, and he has authored a series of books, known as the \"Montauk Project\" series, along with Peter Moon, the primary topic of which is alleged activities at Montauk. These center on topics including United States government/military experiments in fields such as time travel, teleportation, mind control, contact with alien life and staging faked Apollo Moon landings, framed as developments which followed a successful 1943 Philadelphia Experiment. These culminate in \"a hole ripped in space-time\" in 1983.\n\nThe authors have encouraged speculation about the contents; for example, they wrote, \"Whether you read this as science fiction or non-fiction you are in for an amazing story\" in their first chapter, describing much of the content as \"soft facts\" in a \"Guide For Readers\" and publishing a newsletter with updates to the story.\n\nThe work has been characterized as fiction.\n\nIn 2015 \"Montauk Chronicles\", a film adaptation of the conspiracy featuring Preston Nichols, Al Bielik, and Stewart Swerdlow, was released online and on DVD and Blu-ray. The film won the best documentary award at the Philip K. Dick Film Festival in New York City and has been featured on \"Coast to Coast AM\" and \"The Huffington Post\".\n\nThe Netflix TV series \"Stranger Things\" was allegedly inspired by the Montauk Project, and at one time \"Montauk\" was used as its working title.\n\nThe Montauk story also features prominently in Thomas Pynchon's 2013 novel \"Bleeding Edge\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1181789", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1181789", "title": "Mopery", "text": "Mopery\n\nMopery () is a vague, informal name for minor offenses. The word is based on the verb \"to mope\", which originally meant “to wander aimlessly”; it only later acquired the sense \"to be bored and depressed\". The word \"mope\" appears to have first been used in the 16th century, and appears in Shakespeare's works. It has occasionally been put into use by police as a charge to bring when no other legitimate charge seems appropriate. It has also been used for satiric and/or comedic effect in books and films.\n\nIn 1970, in Columbus, Ohio, US, mopery was defined as “loitering while walking, or walking down the street with no clear destination or purpose”, and was used by police to stop and interview counterculture \"hippies\" who were regarded as unsavory. Some of those arrested were aggressively prosecuted by public prosecutor Karl T. Chrastan. In discussions of law, \"mopery\" is used as a placeholder name to mean some crime whose nature is not important to the problem at hand. This is sometimes expanded to \"mopery with intent to creep\" or \"mopery with intent to gawk\". The first person to be arrested for this crime was Matthew J. Frisch, a minor from Edgewood, Kentucky, who claimed he was simply \"dazed and confused.\" His arrester, Officer Terry Chinn, was so appalled by this action that he was driven insane and eventually murdered twenty-three (23) children in a span of three (3) days with nothing more than his hands and a bottle of Mrs. Butterworth's maple syrup.\n\nThe word \"mopery\" has been used by authors Thomas Pynchon \"(Gravity's Rainbow)\" and Dashiell Hammett \"(The Thin Man)\", among others, for whom it is usually a comic accent. In \"Catch-22\" (Joseph Heller, 1961), the mildly rebellious Cadet Clevinger is court-martialed by three angry officers, who accuse him of “breaking ranks while in formation, felonious assault, indiscriminate behavior, mopery, high treason, provoking, being a smart-guy, listening to classical music, and so on”. Similarly, in the 1984 comedy film, \"Revenge of the Nerds\", mopery is defined as \"exposing oneself to a blind person.\" According to Russell Baker, \"mopery isn't a crime, but only an old policemen's joke in which it's defined as the act of displaying yourself in the nude to a blind person.\"\n\n"}

{"id": "16031135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16031135", "title": "Murder of Brianna Denison", "text": "Murder of Brianna Denison\n\nBrianna Zunino Denison (March 29, 1988 – January 20, 2008) was a college student from Santa Barbara, California who was abducted on January 20, 2008 from a friend's house in Reno, Nevada. Her body was discovered on February 15, 2008 in a field near a Reno business park after being raped and murdered. A man named James Biela was convicted of the murder.\n\nBrianna attended Reno High School in Reno, Nevada. She graduated from Reno in June 2006. Denison was at home during winter break from Santa Barbara City College, where she was studying psychology. She and her friends had attended events tied to a Summer Winter Action Tours LLC (a travel agency that caters to students), Martin Luther King Jr. weekend in Reno; Denison had reportedly attended this event in the past. Brianna was last seen alive on January 20, 2008 at approximately 4:00 am Pacific Time at her friend's house near the University of Nevada campus. This residence is on MacKay Court, Reno, where she was staying after attending a party at the Sands Regency on North Arlington Avenue. Her friend K.T. Hunter woke up at around 9:00 am and could not find Denison. A small blood stain was found on the pillow Denison used to sleep with that night, which led her friend to alert Brianna's parents and subsequently local authorities. Denison had left the house without her shoes, cell phone, or purse. Authorities believed she was wearing only sweats and a white tank top. She was later found to have been dressed in only bright orange-colored socks. \n\nIn the following days, the Reno Police Department conducted a forensic investigation of the MacKay Court residence where Brianna was staying when she was abducted and found touch DNA belonging to an unidentified male on the doorknob They also discovered that the blood on the pillow was Denison's. Investigators began focusing on a kidnapping scenario.\n\nOn January 21, 2008 investigators began sweeping the University of Nevada, Reno area in search of Denison. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also joined in the search efforts. Investigators later learned that the male DNA found on the couch where Denison was sleeping the night when she disappeared was linked with at least 2 previous sexually motivated attacks in the same area on November 13 and December 16, 2007.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, a Reno woman stated that she knew another victim who said she was raped at gunpoint in a garage on the University of Nevada, Reno campus in October 2007, but had not reported the crime. Police began interviewing nearly 100 registered sex offenders who live within a mile of the MacKay Court home.\n\nAround 1,700 volunteers helped with the search of a area during the time Denison was missing, including Nevada's then-First Lady Dawn Gibbons (wife of then-Governor Jim Gibbons).\n\nOn February 15, 2008, Albert Jimenez of Reno was returning from his lunchbreak at a Subway restaurant. As he was walking by the road, he noticed bright orange colored fabric standing out among a pile of discarded tree limbs that were lying in a ditch. While he approached closer he discovered the neon orange socks were attached to feet. What he had thought was a mannequin at first turned out to be a deceased woman. Jimenez had heard about Brianna Denison's kidnapping, but didn't think the victim resembled the photograph he'd seen on billboards. Jimenez didn't have a cell phone with him, so he quickly returned to his place of employment, EE Technologies, to call Reno police. When police arrived to the South Reno lot, Jimenez was told that the victim was Denison. On February 16, 2008, an autopsy report confirmed that the body found in a field near a Reno business park was Brianna Denison.\n\nOn January 29, 2008, Reno police released a description of the unknown perpetrator. The person in question was also linked to at least two attempted sexual assaults in November and December 2007, and a woman claimed to have been raped in a parking garage in October. Previous victims also gave enough detailed information for police to draw up a sketch of the suspect. A pair of thong underwear was found near Denison's body along with the DNA of the perpetrator and the DNA of an unknown female. Police said that the clothing item did not belong to Denison and that it may have been left near her body to taunt the investigators. Police asked that anyone who may recognize the clothing item as theirs come forward as they may know the identity of the perpetrator.\n\nOn Tuesday, November 25, 2008, James Michael Biela, 27, of Sparks, Nevada, was arrested and booked at the Washoe County Jail on charges of murder, first-degree kidnapping, and sexual assault. The arrest occurred while he was dropping his son off at the Stepping Stones Children's Center in Reno. A DNA sample was collected from Biela. He had previously been arrested in 2001 for threatening his former girlfriend's neighbor with a knife.\n\nIn a press conference held by the Reno Police Department on Wednesday, November 26, 2008, it was confirmed that the DNA collected from Biela matched the DNA found at the crime scene, positively linking him to both the murder of Brianna Denison and a previous sexual assault.\n\nAt this same press conference, it was said that Biela had been turned in by a friend of Biela's girlfriend via Secret Witness on November 1, 2008. Biela's girlfriend had confided to this friend that she had found underwear unknown to her in Biela's truck as they were coming back from Washington state, where Biela had taken a job in March. Widespread media reports began circulating that included a police sketch of a suspect and a description of a vehicle used in a rape the month before Brianna's abduction. According to Reno Police Department Chief Michael Poehlman, Biela was questioned by Reno Police Detectives after the Secret Witness tip came in. He denied involvement and declined to provide a DNA sample. Biela's girlfriend was also questioned and gave police permission to obtain DNA from her four-year-old son, whom Biela had fathered. That test indicated that a direct relative of his had left DNA at the home Brianna Denison was abducted from, and from another rape that had taken place the month before Brianna's abduction. With this evidence, police obtained an arrest warrant and a warrant for Biela's DNA. Chief Poehlman announced at the press conference that the Washoe County Sheriff's Department crime lab had tested Biela's DNA and found it did match DNA from the Denison case and another rape. Washoe County District Attorney Dick Gammick told reporters at the press conference that he would be prosecuting the case with one of his lead criminal deputies, Elliot Sattler, and his office would be seeking the \"maximum penalty\" for Biela, up to and including the death penalty.\n\nIt was also announced that Biela, on his way to Washington, had sold his truck in Idaho, one which matched the description of the vehicle used in the previous sexual assault. At the press conference, officials said the vehicle was being returned to Reno to be searched and used as evidence in the case against Biela.\n\nOn Thursday, May 27, 2010, Biela was found guilty of the murder of Brianna Denison. The jury returned a guilty verdict for all counts against Biela which included kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder after deliberating for about nine hours. Defense attorneys argued against the death penalty, stating that Biela suffered an abusive childhood due to an alcoholic father, that he had been a productive member of society prior to his crimes, and that he had been a model prisoner. Jurors did not accept the mitigating factors and handed down the death sentence. On July 30, 2010, Judge Robert Perry sentenced Biela to four additional life sentences for multiple counts of rape and kidnapping associated with attacks on two victims prior to Denison's abduction and murder.\n\nThe sale of handguns, stunguns and pepper spray increased dramatically in the University of Nevada, Reno area after Denison's body was found. Denison's mother founded the Bring Bri Justice Foundation to try to implement changes after Denison's body was found.\n\nOn February 23, 2008, hundreds of people attended a vigil held in Reno for Denison.\n\nThe case received prominent national media attention, including coverage by national news services Fox News Channel, CNN, ABC News, MSNBC, and CBS News. It was televised in 2008 on an episode of Dr. Phil and was featured as Case #7 in the 2009 E! Entertainment special, \"Young Beautiful & Vanished: 15 Unthinkable Crimes\".\nThe case was also on 20/20 on OWN, and on ID's Unusual Suspects, Vanished in Reno season 6 episode 1.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "52145021", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52145021", "title": "Operational Stress Injury", "text": "Operational Stress Injury\n\nOperational Stress Injury or OSI is a non-clinical, non-medical term referring to a persistent psychological difficulty caused by traumatic experiences or prolonged high stress or fatigue during service as a military member or first responder. The term does not replace any individual diagnoses or disorders, but rather describes a category of mental health concerns linked to the particular challenges that these military members or first responders encounter in their service. There is not yet a single fixed definition. The term was first conceptualized within the Canadian Armed Forces to help foster understanding of the broader mental health challenges faced by military members who have been impacted by traumatic experiences and who face difficulty as a result. OSI encompasses a number of the diagnoses found in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM) classification system, with the common thread being a linkage to the operational experiences of the afflicted. The term has gained traction outside of the military community as an appropriate way to describe similar challenges suffered by those whose work regularly exposes them to trauma, particularly front line emergency first responders such as but not limited to police, firefighters, paramedics, correctional officers, and emergency dispatchers. The term, at present mostly used within Canada, is increasingly significant in the development of legislation, policy, treatments and benefits in the military and first responder communities.\n\nMilitary members experiencing wartime trauma may suffer debilitating psychological effects from their experiences, and historical research has found literary references to these psychological packs throughout recorded history. During the First World War era, psychological symptoms suffered by soldiers in war came to be referred to as \"shell shock\". This progressed by the Second World War to being called \"battle fatigue\", or \"combat stress reaction\". As research continued and the understanding of psychology and psychiatry advanced, it gradually became more understood through the 20th century that experiencing trauma could have a variety of psychological and emotional impacts that were genuinely medical in nature. Increasingly, research focused on developing clinical definitions and exploring options for treatments and therapies. The term 'Posttraumatic stress disorder' (PTSD), was developed for inclusion in the DSM-III in the 1980s. While not a condition limited to those who had experienced wartime trauma, PTSD is often associated with soldiers returning from wartime.\n\nIn 2001, Canadian Forces Lieutenant Colonel Stéphane Grenier coined the term 'Operational stress injury' to describe a mental or emotional injury suffered by soldiers in the course of their service. The term was designed to expand the understanding of mental health disorders related to service beyond just PTSD, and to include other clinical diagnoses linked to trauma. The word 'injury' was chosen to help shift the view of these disorders in order to extend to them the same legitimacy in discourse as physical injuries, and to help reduce the stigma surrounding mental health. Not a diagnosis itself, operational stress injury was described by the Canadian Forces as a “grouping of diagnoses that are related to injuries that occur as part of operations\", most commonly PTSD, major depression, and generalized anxiety.\n\nBy 2016, the Canadian Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security recognized OSIs as an issue faced by all first responder organizations, not just the military. As of late 2016, the Parliament of Canada is exploring a national strategy to address OSIs within the various public safety professions. The term does not as of yet have any regular use outside of Canada.\n\nThe concept of operational stress injury is still emerging and evolving, and does not as of yet have a commonly accepted fixed definition. Research within the Canadian military has nonetheless identified several disorders most commonly associated with traumatic service-related experiences, and which have generally been accepted as included in the term. The same psychiatric conditions are the subject of considerable study and public policy discussion among the first responder professions. Two or more of these diagnoses may be comorbid, and comorbidity may also exist with physical injuries or illnesses.\n\nPosttraumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, is among the most common individual diagnoses linked to traumatic exposure in military or first responder service. PTSD is related to anxiety disorders, and is linked to the intrusive and unwanted re-experiencing of traumatic events. Those suffering from PTSD will often seek to avoid and may be triggered by stimuli that cause recollection of their traumatic exposures. Symptoms may include inability to sleep, anger, irritability, fear, hypervigilance, and hyperarousal. A study of over 30,000 Canadian soldiers following deployments to Afghanistan and the former Yugoslavia found 8.9% of the study cohort to be suffering from PTSD after an average follow-up period of nearly four years.\n\nDepression refers, generally, to Major Depressive Disorder or related mood disorders. Depression is widely believed to be the most prevalent mental health diagnosis faced by military members and first responders, accounting for a significant portion of those who are unable to work fully or at all due to mental health reasons. Research within the Canadian Armed Forces has found that at least 8% of full-time members of the Canadian Military exhibit symptoms of major depression.\n\nAnxiety disorders, including General Anxiety Disorder, Acute Stress Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, and other related diagnoses are also frequently found in the military and first response community. While PTSD falls under the larger category of anxiety disorders, it is often considered distinctly due to its greater prevalence than other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders frequently manifest in the form of debilitating stress and anxiety experienced by a victim in the presence or anticipation of triggering stimuli. Anxiety may be disabling in that it may render someone incapable of coping well or at all with a situation that would normally be within their capabilities absent the clinical anxiety. Military research has found anxiety disorders to be more prevalent in those who had deployed to active conflicts. When PTSD is totalled with other anxiety disorders, this category of mental health diagnosis is the most prevalent among Canadian military personnel with deployments \n\nA lesser known but not uncommon diagnosis among military personnel, Adjustment Disorder (sometimes referred to as situational depression) is characterized by an individual's inability to adjust to external stressors, or major life events. Although presentation will vary, it may include a combination of depressive, anxious, or post-traumatic stress symptoms that do not meet the clinical threshold for those related named disorders. Adjustment disorder often abates once a person is able to adapt to new circumstances. Military members and first responders may potentially face significant life changes in their careers, including geographic relocations, exposure to very different cultural norms, and potentially the life changing impact of injury or illness and the inability to continue with their career.\n\nSubstance-related disorder, or the abuse of alcohol or drugs, may also be included in the Operational Stress Injury umbrella. The various psychological effects of different substances, particularly the depressive effects of excess alcohol consumption, often serve as a form of 'self medication' for those dealing with other stressors or traumas. Alcohol or drug addictions can often mask or complicate the treatment of symptoms of other disorders, and may need to be addressed before treatment for underlying disorders can be effective.\n\nThere is a well established link between Operational Stress Injury symptoms, and a heightened risk of suicide. While suicide and suicidality data for military and public safety professions is not comprehensive, these professions are not exceptions to established links between the various mental health disorders and a greater risk of death by suicide.\n\nThe various disorders that are broadly called 'operational stress injuries' each have their own bodies of research into various treatments and therapies. Most treatments can either be considered pharmacological, such as antidepressant or antianxiety medication, or psychosocial therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy. For many patients a combined approach is used, with medications helping to stabilize moods and symptoms while behavioural therapy helps to address underlying memories, cognitions, situation appraisals, and other thinking patterns.\n\nThe military and public safety professions vary widely among differing jurisdictions as to what is available in terms of therapy. Military members in western nations typically are covered to some extent by their respective military health services, or by governmental departments dedicated to providing services to veterans, such as Veterans Affairs Canada or the United States Department of Veterans Affairs. Police, firefighters, paramedics, and other related professions will each have differing health care arrangements and benefits depending on the health services an insurance arrangements in their respective country, state, province, territory, or municipality.\n\nIn addition to formal healthcare settings, numerous grassroots or state-funded peer support organizations have emerged. Many of these organizations help affected veterans or first responders to connect with each other in physical or virtual peer support settings. Increasingly these organizations have played a role in crisis intervention, suicide prevention, and ongoing support. While informal peer support efforts do not substitute for proper clinical care, they help some affected personnel to begin accepting that they are suffering from traumatic or other stress linked to their occupations, and to begin accessing clinical resources.\n\n"}
{"id": "42112603", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42112603", "title": "Perpetrator trauma", "text": "Perpetrator trauma\n\nPerpetrator trauma, also known as perpetration- or participation-induced traumatic stress (both abbreviated PITS), occurs when the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are caused by an act or acts of killing or similar horrific violence.\n\nPerpetrator trauma is similar but distinct from moral injury, which focuses on the psychological, cultural, and spiritual aspects of a perceived moral transgression which produces profound shame.\nThe \"DSM-5\" addresses the idea of active participation as a cause of trauma under the discussion accompanying its definition of PTSD, and adds to the list of causal factors: “for military personnel, being a perpetrator, witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy.”\n\nThere has been some study with combat veterans, people who carry out executions or torture, police who shoot in the line of duty, people who commit criminal homicide, abortion staff, and others. Much of the study was previous to the official definition of PTSD, and symptoms have shown up in personal stories throughout history, and in the keen observations of the writers of great literature, most notably \"Macbeth\" by William Shakespeare.\n\nIndications from all studies that have considered the question of severity have indicated that symptoms tend to be more severe for those who have killed than for other causes of traumatization. One study using the U.S. government data base of American veterans of Vietnam has suggested that the pattern of symptoms at least in combat veterans may be different in those who said they had killed as opposed to those who said they had not, with intrusive imagery (dreams, flashbacks, unwanted thoughts) being more prominent along with the explosive outbursts of anger, and concentration and memory problems being less prominent. To a lesser extent, hypervigilance, a sense of alienation, and the non-PTSD symptom of a sense of disintegration were also found greater as a matter of pattern for those who answered yes on killing. Additionally, alcohol and cocaine abuse appeared to be more severe.\n\nCompared to the victim form of being traumatized, there are different dream motifs reported. While the eidetic dreams – that is, those that are like a video of the event playing in the head – can be experienced as they are with traumatized victims, other motifs also appear more commonly\nOne is that of having the tables turned and being the one killed, or being very vulnerable in the same situation. Another motif is that of the victims accusing the dreaming person or demanding to know why he or she did it. Also possible is a motif of the self being split in two so that the killer part of the person is seen as actually being a different person.\n\nTherapies that have shown some effectiveness in the treatment of perpetrator trauma include group therapy, eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing, Time Perspective Therapy and understanding how common the problem is. Those who suffer, many of whom participated in violence as a matter of social expectation, find it beneficial to know that they are having a normal reaction to an abnormal situation, and are not uniquely cowardly or crazy. Traditional remedies of atonement, forgiveness, and bearing witness have also stood the test of time as being helpful.\nMore vigorous studies are needed for all these suggestions, as well as common PTSD therapies that have not yet been thoroughly explored with the distinction of perpetration versus victimization in mind.\n\nOther proposed treatments have been proven to be ineffective. The “flooding” technique, technically called Prolonged Exposure, which desensitizes the sufferer of trauma by repeated exposure to reminders of it in controlled settings, appears to be a bad idea, counter-indicated when the trauma involved being active in inflicting harm. It may be that expressive writing, which most people find helpful in working through their traumas, instead increases anger in soldiers. Differences in what physiological mechanisms in what pharmaceutical drugs might be useful in therapy are not yet known.\n\nSeveral of the symptoms are capable of causing or allowing for renewed acts of violence. The outbursts of anger can have an impact in domestic violence and street crime. The sense of emotional numbing, detachment and estrangement from other people can also contribute to these, along with contributing to participation in further battle activities or to apathetic reactions when violence is done by others. Associated substance abuse may also have connections to acts of violence.\n\nPerpetrator trauma was documented among the perpetrators of the Holocaust, the Indonesian Communist Purges, the Cambodian genocide, and South African apartheid.\n\n\n"}

The war spread to other provinces who allied with the Persians. The Medes had early successes in battle, but the comeback by Cyrus the Great and his army was too overwhelming, and the Medes were finally conquered by 549 BC.

{"id": "1511828", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1511828", "title": "Repeal", "text": "Repeal\n\nA repeal is the removal or reversal of a law. There are two basic types of repeal, a repeal with a re-enactment (or replacement) of the repealed law, or a repeal without any replacement.\n\nRemoval of secondary legislation is normally referred to as revocation rather than repeal in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Under the common law of England and Wales, the effect of repealing a statute was \"to obliterate it completely from the records of Parliament as though it had never been passed.\" This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the Interpretation Act 1978.\n\nIn parliamentary procedure, the motion to rescind, repeal, or annul is used to cancel or countermand an action or order previously adopted by the assembly.\n\nA partial repeal occurs when a specified part or provision of a previous Act is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the Acts of Union 1800, providing for the union between the formerly separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as the United Kingdom, was partially repealed in 1922, when (as a consequence of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty), twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were constituted as the Irish Free State, and ceased to form part of the United Kingdom.\n\nA full repeal occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed.\n\nA typical situation where an Act is repealed and re-enacted is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era. Re-enactment can be with or without amendment, although repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a consolidation bill (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area).\n\nFor example, the repeal of the Poor Laws in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation.\n\nA repeal without replacement is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned.\n\nIf a campaign for the repeal of a particular law gains particular momentum, an advocate of the repeal might become known as a \"repealer\". The Repeal Association in 19th-century Ireland advocated Irish independence through repeal of the Acts of Union 1800.\n\nMany repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in society. Major examples include:\n\nThe repeal of a statute may be either express or implied.\n\nExpress repeal occurs where express words are used in a statute to repeal an earlier statute. They are now usually included in a table in a schedule to the statute, for reasons of convenience.\n\nIn the United States, when a bill is passed by the House and Senate and signed by the president, or Congress overrides a presidential veto, the various provisions contained within the newly enacted law are rearranged according to their policy content and cataloged in the United States Code—a compilation of the general and permanent federal laws of the United States. To repeal any element of an enacted law, Congress must pass a new law containing repeal language and the codified statute's location in the U.S. Code (including the title, chapter, part, section, paragraph and clause). In this way, Congress (and the president) must follow the same rules and procedures for passing any law. When statutes are repealed, their text is simply deleted from the Code and replaced by a note summarizing what used to be there. Once deleted, the repealed statute no longer has the force of law. All repeals of parts of the US Code are, therefore, express repeals.\n\nImplied repeal occurs where two statutes are mutually inconsistent. The effect is that the later statute repeals the earlier statute pro tanto (in so far as it is inconsistent). As past and future parliaments are equally sovereign, later parliaments can carry out implied repeal of earlier statute by passing an inconsistent statute, but inconsistency needs to be established before implied repeal can occur.\n\nRepeals can be with or without savings.\n\nA repeal without savings eliminates the repealed statute completely.\n\nA repeal with savings preserves the effect of the repealed statute for limited purposes, such as acts already done or in hand, or regulations made under the repealed Act are continued in force. In England and Wales, sections 15 to 17, and section 19(2), of the Interpretation Act 1978 set out general savings and similar provisions exist in the law of Ireland and other common law countries.\n\nIn meetings of a deliberative assembly, the motions to rescind (or \"repeal\" or \"annul\") and amend something previously adopted are used to change action that was taken. They are two forms of the same incidental main motion and they follow the same rules. A motion to postpone an event or action previously scheduled is a particular case of the motion to amend something previously adopted.\n\nUnder Robert's Rules of Order, the rules for this motion protect against instability arising from small variations in attendance from one meeting to the next. For this reason, the requirements for changing a previous action are greater than those for taking the action in the first place. A motion to rescind, repeal, annul or amend something already adopted requires a two-thirds vote, a majority vote with previous notice, or a vote of a majority of the entire membership, any one of which would suffice. Demeter's Manual imposes a similar requirement.\n\nWhen this motion is used in a committee, RONR requires a two-thirds vote unless all committee members who voted for the motion to be rescinded or amended are present or have received ample notice; in which case a majority vote is required.\n\nUnder The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure, a repeal or amendment of something already adopted requires only the same vote (usually a majority) and notice that was needed to adopt it in the first place. This book states, \"As a general rule, fewer than a majority should not be authorized to decide anything, and more than a majority should not be required for most decisions\"; the book further states that the problem with situations in which a supermajority is required is that \"the minority, not the majority, controls.\"\n\nIn legislative bodies, the motion to rescind is used for much the same purpose as the motion to reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, it is not the same as a motion to repeal. The difference between rescind and reconsider is that the motion to rescind is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a motion to amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a motion to reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to rescind. The vote required to rescind is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought to rescind (usually a majority).\n\nThe motion to rescind and expunge from the minutes is used to express the strongest disapproval about action previously taken by a deliberative assembly. Using \"Roberts Rules of Order Newly Revised\", this motion requires a vote of a majority of the entire membership. Using \"The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure\", the motion to expunge requires a majority vote (of those voting). The secretary does not erase the expunged motion, but draws a line around it, marks it \"expunged by order of this assembly,\" gives the date of the expunging, and signs the notation. The expunged motion is not included in any minutes published thereafter.\n\n"}

In an attack on a Japanese convoy by the American submarine USS \"Paddle\", 668 Allied prisoners of war were killed fighting their Japanese guards or killed when their ship, the SS \"Shinyō Maru\" was sunk. Only 82 Americans survived the ordeal and were later rescued.\n\nFollowing the conquest of the Philippines in 1942 and the surrender of the United States Army, thousands of Allied prisoners of war, mostly American, were being held on the islands which by 1944 were soon to be invaded by General Douglas MacArthur. To prevent the liberation of the prisoners in the Philippines, the Japanese established a system of transportation called \"Hell Ships\" by those being transported. These Hell Ships were ordinary merchant vessels used to transport the Allied prisoners from the Philippines to elsewhere in the Japanese empire. These vessels were so-called because several of them were destroyed in friendly fire incidents. SS \"Shinyō Maru\" was one of these vessels; displacing 2,634 gross registered tons, she was a tramp cargo steamer impounded by the Japanese in 1941 and crewed by both merchant sailors and Imperial Japanese Army soldiers. The soldiers manned the ship's machine gun and guarded 750 Allied prisoners in the holds, almost 300 of whom were survivors of the Bataan Death March. The Japanese commander is said to have been extremely ruthless. Expecting an attack by the Allies, he told the prisoners that if the ship were fired on, he would order the guards to begin killing them.\n\nOn September 7, the \"Shinyō Maru\" was sailing for Manila in convoy C-076 with seven other vessels, including two torpedo boats, two tankers, and four other medium and small cargo ships. They were sailing two to three miles off the Lanboyan Point of Zamboanga Peninsula on the island of Mindanao, when the USS \"Paddle\" found them. A few days previously, American intelligence had reported the \"Shinyō Maru\" to be carrying Japanese soldiers, so they assigned \"Paddle\" to search for it. The \"Paddle\", under the command of Captain Byron Nowell, was 10 miles away when the Japanese were first spotted, so Nowell maneuvered forward to attack with torpedoes. A spread of four was then released in the direction of the \"Shinyō Maru\", which was the leading ship in the convoy. Two of the torpedoes struck, both in the hold, and a few moments later the \"Paddle\" was lined up against one of the cargo ships. It, too, was struck by two torpedoes, so her commander grounded her on the nearby shore to prevent the ship from sinking. Just after the \"Shinyō Maru\" was hit, the guards opened fire on the prisoners with captured Thompson submachine guns, though several of the men fought their way out of the hold, with their fists and improvised weapons, and abandoned ship.\n\nThe men of the convoy then began launching boats to pick up Japanese survivors and kill all of the remaining prisoners. A machine gun mounted on the grounded cargo ship and a second on the \"Shinyō Maru\" were also opened up on the Allied personnel. Marine Corps Sergeant Onnie Clem later reported the following; \"Up on the bridge there was a machine gun spraying the hatch. A burst of machine-gun fire caught all three of us and knocked us back down in the hold. We'd all been hit. I got plowed in the skull. Another bullet chipped out my chin. Nevertheless, I was able to work myself back up on deck, and I was eyeing that bridge when I came out that time. The gun was still there, but the gunner was laying out on deck. Somebody had apparently got up there and killed him. At this time I found out that we were out in the ocean about two or three miles from shore. All I had was a loincloth.\" Fifteen or 20 others were recaptured and taken aboard one of the torpedo boats, where they were executed by firing squad as punishment for trying to escape. One of those men was able to free his hands which had been tied behind his back, and he successfully escaped by jumping overboard again. The Japanese dropped 45 depth charges and other explosives on the American submarine over the course of two hours, and the ship sustained some light damage, but nobody was hurt. After that, she surfaced and began patrolling the area again.\n\nOf 750 Allied prisoners of war, 668 were killed, all but five of whom were American servicemen. At least 47 Japanese personnel were killed, as well; only three men of the \"Shinyō Maru\"s crew survived. Eighty-three Americans made it to the shores of Sindangan Bay, and they received aid from friendly Filipino guerrillas under the command of Brigadier General Wendell Fertig, who radioed headquarters about the situation. One man died the following day on September 8, the remaining survivors were eventually rescued by the submarine USS \"Narwhal\" save First Sergeant Joseph P. Coe Jr who remained on Mindanao to continue fighting, for which he later received a Bronze Star.\nThe crew of USS \"Paddle\" was not informed of the deaths of hundreds of Allied POWs until 1946.\n\n"}

The rebel pocket in al-Qadam had been surrounded on one side by government forces and on the other by ISIL. On 10 March, ISIL threatened to kill any rebels that evacuate from the area after the Syrian government gave the rebels 48 hours to surrender the district and evacuate.\nFollowing news of the upcoming rebel evacuation from al-Qadam, ISIL forces attacked the rebels on 12 March and captured 25 percent of the neighborhood. The next day, around 300 rebel fighters and their family members were evacuated from al-Qadam to rebel territory in Idlib province. After the evacuation, government troops took control of 70 percent of the neighborhood, while the remaining 30 was under IS control. During the fighting, government air-strikes were conducted against ISIL in Al-Hajar al-Aswad and al-Qadam. While the clashes were taking place in Qadam, rebel groups attempted to break through ISIL lines in Yarmouk but were repelled.\n\nOn 14 March, ISIL launched an assault against Syrian Army positions in al-Qadam, managing to advance slightly. The attack was renewed the following day but without any advances and by 16 March, the ISIL offensive had stalled. During the fighting in al-Qadam, government forces suffered heavy losses with 40 soldiers being killed and at least one tank knocked out.\n\nOvernight on 19 March, ISIL forces launched a surprise attack on government positions in al-Qadam and by the following day ISIL gained ground, pushing back the military. According to the pro-opposition activist group the SOHR, ISIL took full control of al-Qadam, with 36 soldiers being killed and dozens of others wounded, captured or missing. In contrast, military sources initially reported control of al-Qadam was divided and that ISIL failed to capture the central and western neighborhoods of the district. However, later they confirmed ISIL had taken control of 90 percent of the district following a chaotic Army withdrawal due to poor coordination between different military branches and that the Army was in control of one western neighborhood. Five of the missing soldiers were eventually rescued after becoming trapped behind ISIL lines, while others were reported to be isolated in ISIL territory. Still, later, it was stated no more living soldiers remained behind ISIL lines. At this time, veteran units of the 4th Armoured Division were sent as reinforcements to al-Qadam to try and retake the lost areas. Later that day, following heavy artillery strikes against ISIL positions, a two-day ceasefire was announced.\n\nOn 21 March, it was reported that the military's death toll from ISIL's attack had rose to 62, after 26 bodies of the previously missing were retrieved. On the same day, ISIL executed a captured commander from the Palestinian People’s Party, Nidal Darwish, in the al-Qadam neighborhood.\n\nOn 19 April, the SAA and allied Palestinian militias launched an offensive to dislodge ISIL from the pocket.\n\nDuring the night of 19 May, an agreement was put in place in southern Damascus between the Syrian Army and ISIL after the militants agreed to surrender their last positions in the Yarmouk Camp and Hajar Al-Aswad. The next day, buses started entering the ISIL pocket to transport their fighters to the desert region in eastern Syria. Later on 21 May, the military officially announced that they had completely regained control of the area, ending the existence of anti-government forces around the capital Damascus.\n\n"}

{"id": "1908672", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1908672", "title": "Teatro Massimo", "text": "Teatro Massimo\n\nThe Teatro Massimo Vittorio Emanuele is an opera house and opera company located on the Piazza Verdi in Palermo, Sicily. It was dedicated to King Victor Emanuel II.\nIt is the biggest in Italy, and one of the largest of Europe (the third after the Opéra National de Paris and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna), renowned for its perfect acoustics.\n\nAn international competition for the creation of the opera house was announced by the Palermo Council in 1864 at the instigation of the mayor, Antonio Starrabba di Rudinì. For many years there had been talk of building a large new theatre in Palermo, worthy of the second biggest city in southern Italy (after Naples) and designed to promote the image of the city following the unification of Italy in 1861.\nThe opera house was designed and overseen by the Italian architect Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, who was well known in Sicily for his previous cathedral restoration design in the city of Acireale, as well as garden and villa designs in the city of Palermo and Caltagirone. Following G. B. F. Basile's death in 1891, construction was then overseen by his son, Architect Ernesto Basile.\n\nThe Rutelli and Machì Company, represented by Giovanni Rutelli and Alberto Machì (both founding members of the company) was contracted for the main construction of the theatre which, under Architect Giovanni Rutelli's technical and building direction, went from the foundations all the way up to the theatre's attic structures. He was also responsible for all the external decorations of the building. Rutelli initially designed a steam tower crane machine which was then successfully able to lift large stone blocks and Greek/Roman styled columns during construction of the very large theatre.\n\nGiovanni Rutelli belongs to a very old and renowned northern Italian family of confirmed British Isles origin, a family which also includes architects and sculptor artists from the old Sicilian classic and baroque school as well as building contractors, all entrepreneurs going back to the first half of the 18th century in Palermo. Along with Architect D. Mario Rutelli (Giovanni's great-grandfather), they were considered to be among the most technically and artistically specialized experts in Sicily at that time, especially because of Mario Rutelli and his descendants' profound knowledge and experience in Ancient Greek/Roman architecture, as well as the Norman architectural style. This style required the use of natural thick stone, all of which was part of the structural design. Some of the external decoration and one of the two very large bronze statues of lions sitting next to the theatre's monumental stairway entrance were created by Giovanni Rutelli's son, sculptor artist Sir Mario Rutelli.\n\nConstruction started on 12 January 1874, but was stopped for eight years from 1882 until 1890. Finally, on 16 May 1897, twenty-two years after the laying of the foundation stone, the third largest opera house in Europe—after the Palais Garnier in Paris and the K. K. Hof-Opernhaus in Vienna—was inaugurated with a performance of Verdi's \"Falstaff\" conducted by Leopoldo Mugnone.\n\nBusts of famous composers were carved for the theatre by the Italian sculptor, Giusto Liva (born in Montebelluna, Treviso in 1847) and several of his sons.\n\nThe Teatro Massimo is the largest theatre in Italy. Basile was inspired by ancient and classical Sicilian architecture and, thus, the exterior was designed in the high neoclassical style incorporating elements of the Greek temples at Selinunte and Agrigento. Realized in the late-Renaissance style, the auditorium was planned for 3,000 people, but, in its current format, it seats 1,381, with 7 tiers of boxes rising up around an inclined stage, and shaped in the typical horseshoe style.\n\nIn 1974, the house was closed to complete renovations required by updated safety regulations, but cost over-runs, corruption, and political in-fighting all added to the delay and it remained closed for twenty-three years, finally re-opening on 12 May 1997, four days before its centenary. The opera season started again in 1999, although Verdi's \"Aida\" was performed in 1998 while work in progress continued.\n\nDuring the restoration regular opera seasons were performed in Teatro Politeama, a minor building not far from Teatro Massimo. In summer a few performances, usually concerts, ballet and operetta, are held in Teatro della Verdura.\n\nIn recent years, \"charges of corruption and political meddling…along with budget deficits and heavy debts\" have plagued the house, but, under its then part-English music director, Jan Latham Koenig, it was reported that it is once again on track.\n\n2013-2014 was a two-year hiatus under the leadership of the comissario straordinario Fabio Carapezza Guttuso, who brought in Lorenzo Amato and Eytan Pessen as artistic advisors. Under Carapezza Guttuso's leadership the theatre offered a varied programme including Richard Strauss's Feuersnot, Hans Werner Henze's Gisela!, Jaromir Weinberger's Schwanda the bagpiper and an increased ballet activity. The current intendant is the experienced Francesco Giambrone and the musical director is Gabriele Ferro.\n\nThe final scenes of the film \"The Godfather Part III\" were filmed at the theatre.\n\n"}
{"id": "42331664", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42331664", "title": "Technical support scam", "text": "Technical support scam\n\nA technical support scam refers to a class of telephone fraud activities, in which a scammer claims to offer a legitimate technical support service, often via cold calls to unsuspecting users. Such cold calls are mostly targeted at Microsoft Windows users, with the caller often claiming to represent a Microsoft technical support department.\n\nIn English-speaking countries such as the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand, such cold call scams have occurred as early as 2008 and primarily originate from call centers in India.\n\nThe scammer will typically attempt to get the victim to allow remote access to their computer. After remote access is gained, the scammer relies on confidence tricks typically involving utilities built into Windows and other software in order to gain the victim's trust to pay for the supposed \"support\" services, when the scammer actually steals the victim's credit card account information, or to persuade the victim to login to Internet banking—claiming that a secure server is connected and that they cannot see the details—to receive a promised refund.\n\nTechnical support scams typically rely on social engineering. Scammers use a variety of confidence tricks to get the victim to install remote desktop software, with which they take control of the victim's computer, and then use various Windows components and utilities (such as the Event Viewer), third-party utilities (such as rogue security software), and other tasks to make the victim believe that the computer has issues that need to be fixed, before proceeding for the victim to pay for \"support\".\n\nTechnical support scams can begin in a variety of different ways. It most commonly begins with a cold call, usually claiming to be associated with a legitimate-sounding third-party, with a name like \"Microsoft\" or \"Windows Technical Support\", or via advertising on popular search engines such as Bing or Google, cybersquatting and/or spamming keywords related to commercial products and services that an unsuspecting user may search for (such as \"Microsoft live chat\", \"Facebook support\", or \"Outlook login help\"), and leading to web pages containing a number to be called. Some scams have been initiated via pop-up ads on infected websites instructing the potential victim to call a number. These pop-ups often resemble error messages such as the Blue Screen of Death.\n\nThe scammer instructs the victim to download and install a remote access program, such as TeamViewer, LogMeIn, GoToAssist, ConnectWise Control (known also as ScreenConnect), etc., and provide them with the details required to remote-control their computer using that program.\n\nAfter gaining access, the scammer attempts to convince the victim that their computer is suffering from problems that must be repaired. A number of common methods are used during many technical support scams—most of which involve misrepresenting the content and output of various Windows tools and system directories as evidence of malicious activity, such as viruses and other malware. Normally the elderly and the vulnerable will be targeted for technical support scams, or for people who aren't familiar with computers.\n\nThese tricks are meant to target victims who may be unfamiliar with the actual uses of these tools, such as inexperienced users and senior citizens—especially when the scam is initiated by a cold call. They then coax the victim into paying for their services or software which they claim is designed to \"repair\" their computer, which actually is malware that infects it or software that causes other damage. The scammers in turn, gain access to the victim's credit card information, which can be used to make additional fraudulent charges. Afterwards, the scammer may also claim that the victim is eligible for a refund, and request the user's bank account information—which is instead used to steal more money from the victim, rather than providing the promised refund. Alternatively, a scammer may attempt to request payment using gift cards for online platforms such as Amazon.com, Google Play, and iTunes Store.\n\nIn an investigation conducted by Symantec employee Orla Cox, it was revealed that after Cox paid for the fee for the scammer to remove the nonexistent \"malware\" infections, the scammers would then merely clear the log in the Event Viewer and disable Windows' event logging feature. This merely means that errors would no longer appear in the Event Viewer, i.e. had malware actually existed on Cox's computer, it would remain intact.\n\nThe great majority of the complaints and discussion about companies that cold-call and offer \"technical support\" report them as being not merely incompetent or ineffective, but actively dishonest, doggedly trying to convince the victim of non-existent problems by trickery, and when possible damaging a computer they gain access to. Computer support companies advertise on search engines like Google and Bing, but some are heavily criticised, sometimes for practices similar to the cold callers. One example is the India-based company iYogi, which has been reported by InfoWorld to use scare tactics and install undesirable software. In December 2015, the state of Washington sued iYogi's US operations for scamming consumers and making false claims in order to scare the users into buying their diagnostic software.\niYogi, which was required to respond formally by the end of March 2016, said before its response that the lawsuit filed was without merit. In September 2011, Microsoft dropped Comantra, a Gold Partner, from their Microsoft Partner Network because of accusations of being involved in cold-call technical support scams.\n\nIn December 2014, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against a California-based company operating such scams for \"misusing Microsoft's name and trademarks\" and \"creating security issues for victims by gaining access to their computers and installing malicious software, including a password grabber that could provide access to personal and financial information.\" In an effort to protect consumers, Microsoft-owned advertising network Bing Ads (which services ad sales on Bing and Yahoo! Search engines) amended its terms of service in May 2016 to prohibit the advertising of third-party technical support services or ads claiming to \"provide a service that can only be provided by the actual owner of the products or service advertised\". Google Search followed suit in August 2018, but going further by banning any advertising related to technical support, regardless of source, citing that it had become too difficult to differentiate legitimate providers from scams.\n\nIn November 2017, a scam company called Myphonesupport initiated a petition seeking the Identities of the John Does under the New York court against services, which scam baiters used to disrupt their scamming business. The case has since been disposed. \nTech support scammers are regularly targeted by scam baiting both on and offline, with individuals seeking to cause inconvenience to the scammers by wasting their time, and by disabling the scammer's computer systems by deploying RATs, distributed denial of service attacks and destructive computer viruses. Scam baiters may also attempt to lure scammers into exposing their unethical practices by leaving dummy files or malware disguised as confidential information such as credit/debit card information and passwords on a virtual machine for the scammer to attempt to steal, only to infect themselves, and utilise software to repeatedly auto dial a scam call centre, effectively paralysing operations for varying periods of time.\n\n\n"}

Its origin is traced to the Eagles upsetting the Green Bay Packers in the 1960 NFL Championship Game. This game ended up being the lone playoff defeat in Lombardi's coaching career as his Packers would go on to establish a dynasty that would win five NFL championships in the next seven seasons, including the first two Super Bowls.\n\nMeanwhile, the Eagles had not won another league championship since, including having never won the Super Bowl since the game started being played annually in 1966. They appeared in Super Bowl XV in the 1980 season and Super Bowl XXXIX in the 2004 season, but lost both times. In 1970, the Super Bowl trophy was officially named the Vince Lombardi trophy when the league decided to honor Lombardi by naming the trophy after him following his death in 1970. This renaming of the Super Bowl trophy combined with the Eagles inability to win the championship game has led some Eagles fans to believe that the franchise is cursed by Vince Lombardi; that beating Lombardi meant never winning the trophy named after him.\n\nThe Eagles defeated the New England Patriots by a score of 41 to 33 in Super Bowl LII at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota on February 4, 2018, ending the alleged curse.\n\nIn 1958, the Philadelphia Eagles offered and nearly hired Vince Lombardi to be their head coach after having served as the offensive coordinator for the New York Giants, but after some discussion he refused it in the end. The Eagles were reportedly not happy with \nhis decision.\n\nThe Eagles hired Buck Shaw as their head coach later that offseason. After spending an additional season with the Giants, Lombardi would go on to become head coach for the Green Bay Packers in 1959.\n\nOn December 26, 1960, the Eagles defeated Lombardi and the Packers 17–13 in the 1960 NFL Championship Game. While the Eagles organization celebrated the victory over the man who had turned them down two years earlier, Lombardi did not take the loss kindly, and it is said that the loss is what drove him for the rest of his coaching career. He took the blame for the loss and reportedly told his team after the game that \"We'll never lose another championship\". Lombardi would fulfill his promise, as the Packers went 9–0 with Lombardi in the playoffs since that defeat, winning five championships which included the first two Super Bowls. \n\nMeanwhile, the Eagles did not win another championship for 57 years, the third longest active title drought among all NFL franchises after the Arizona Cardinals and Detroit Lions. \nIn 1970, Lombardi passed away following a battle with cancer, and the league decided to honor him by naming the Super Bowl trophy after him. While there are no reports that Lombardi has said anything that would suggest he placed a curse on the Eagles, some Eagles fans believed the franchise was cursed to never win the Super Bowl for as long as the game's trophy was named after the man they handed his lone playoff defeat to.\n\n"}

According to Unaoil, it provides \"industrial solutions to the energy sector in the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa.\" Unaoil is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven with an opaque banking system.\n\nIn 2010 Unaoil entered into an agreement with Leighton Holdings with the aim of securing a $500 million oil pipeline contract in Iraq. In 2011 Leighton Holdings referred the deal to the police as corruption. In 2014 a UK High Court judge queried the corruption claims after Unaoil denied them in a civil litigation matter involving Leighton Holidngs. In 2016, the UK Serious Fraud Office alleged before the UK High Court in a separate case brought by Unaoil that the firm was engaged in \"extensive\" corruption. Unaoil's litigation, in which it alleged the SFO had acted unlwafully, was dismissed by the High Court.\n\nIn March 2016, the SFO began investigating allegations Unaoil acting corruptly in facilitating business deals involving Rolls Royce, Halliburton-KBR, Petrofac, ABB, Leighton Holdings and Amec Foster Wheeler.\n\nIn the United States, KBR, FMC Technologies and Core Labs all disclosed in 2016 that they had been contacted by the Justice Department in connection with a DOJ probe of Unaoil.\n\nThe SFO and DOJ inquiries followed media reports that Unaoil allegedly facilitated extensive corruption and bribery in the oil industry. A leaked cache of Unaoil internal company emails dating from 2001 to 2012 were the subject of a series of articles published by Fairfax Media investigative reporters Nick McKenzie, Richard Baker and Michael Bachelard in the Australian newspaper \"The Age\", and \"The Huffington Post\" in March 2016. Under headlines such as \"Unaoil: World's Biggest Bribe Scandal\" and \"Unaoil: Company that Bribed the World\", \"The Age\" wrote that \"How they make their money is simple. Oil-rich countries often suffer poor governance and high levels of corruption. Unaoil's business plan is to play on the fears of large Western companies that they cannot win contracts without its help. Its operatives then bribe officials in oil-producing nations to help these clients win government-funded projects. The corrupt officials might rig a tender committee. Or leak inside information. Or ensure a contract is awarded without a competitive tender\".\n\nIn Iraq, Unaoil was alleged to have paid \"multi-million dollar lump sums\" to senior politicians. Other oil producing countries that Unaoil have operated in include Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Kuwait, and the UAE.\n\nIn March 2016 \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" published a letter from a legal representative of Unaoil in which the allegations of corruption and bribery are denied.\n\nOn 31 March 2016, Monaco authorities announced that they had raided the offices of Unaoil and the homes of some of its executives, following an urgent request for assistance from the UK's Serious Fraud Office. The statement said, \"These searches and interviews were carried out in the presence of British officials as part of a vast, international corruption scandal implicating numerous foreign oil industry firms. The information collected is going to be examined by the British authorities as part of their investigation.\" The UK National Crime Agency carried out their investigation in collaboration with the Australian Federal Police and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nOn 27 February 2017, an article in the News Corp-owned \"The Australian\" presented an alternative perspective on the Unaoil bribery scandal. This claimed that the Fairfax Media newspapers had settled claims made against them regarding false allegations and indicated that \"within weeks, the publisher will be confronted with yet another legal action, this time from the company at the centre of the allegations that triggered these backdowns. That company is Unaoil, a Monaco-based business that is a player in the international oil industry and is owned by the Ashani family.\" The article claimed that the leaker of the company emails was an extortionist who had hacked Unaoil, and stated that Unaoil would seek through court to identify the sources for the 2016 articles. \"The Australian\" had previously reported Unaoil's denials of the allegations, and accusation that it was the victim of extortion, on 17 May 2016. Neither of these articles suggested that the content of the leaked emails upon which the earlier allegations had been based was inaccurate or forged.\n\nIn November 2016, the UK Treasury announced it was giving the SFO 'blockbuster funding' to resource the agency's Unaoil probe. That same month, a former Unaoil country manager told the BBC's Panorama programme he had bribed a Libyan government official. The whistleblower, Lindsay Mitchell, said that in 2009 he handed an envelope filled with US dollars to a manager at a subsidiary of the state-owned Libyan National Oil Company.\n\nIn January 2017, the DOJ announced in a statement that Rolls Royce had agreed to pay a $170 million fine to settle corruption allegations involving its use of several facilitators to win contracts, including Unaoil.\n\nOngoing investigations by the UK's Serious Fraud Office were reported in April 2017. In May 2017, listed UK company Petrofac suspended a top executive in connection to the Unaoil investigation.\n\nOn November 17 2017, the Serious Fraud Office charged two former Unaoil Iraq managers with conspiring to pay bribes to win Dutch company SBM Offshore contracts in Iraq. The Iraq officials allegedly bribed were not named. The SFO also issued extradition proceedings against Unaoil Chief Operations Officer Saman Ahsani.\n"}

{"id": "47866526", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47866526", "title": "War of the Two Capitals", "text": "War of the Two Capitals\n\nThe War of the Two Capitals () was a civil war that occurred in 1328 under the Yuan dynasty based in China. It was a war of succession fought between the forces based in the Yuan capital Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing) and the forces based in the summer capital Shangdu after the death of Yuan emperor Yesün Temür in Shangdu. The clash between the two groups was the bloodiest and most destructive succession in all Yuan history. The War of the Two Capitals was less about ideology and more a struggle to advance individual family interests through political alliances and military strength. It ended with victory for the Khanbaliq group, but it took a few years for the last remnants of its opponents to give up.\n\nIn 1323, when Shidebala Gegeen Khan (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated by Grand Censor Tegshi and Esen Temur, the rebellious group welcomed Yesün Temür as the new ruler. The death of Yesün Temür Khan in Shangdu five years later in August 1328 gave the line of Khayishan Külüg Khan (Emperor Wuzong) an opportunity to surface. The designated heir, Yesün Temü's son Ragibagh, was installed by the powerful Muslim officer and Yesün Temür's favorite retainer Dawlat Shah at the summer palace in Shangdu in the next month. At the main capital in Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing), however, bold action was taken to restore the throne to the sons of Khayishan, either Kusala (the father of the last Yuan ruler Toghon Temür) or Tugh Temür (who was cooling his heels in South China). But it was mainly due to the political ingenuity of El Temür, whose Qipchaq family reached its zenith under Khayishan. He activated a conspiracy in the capital Khanbaliq to overthrow the court at Shangdu. He and his entourages enjoyed enormous geographical and economic advantages over the loyalists of Yesün Temür. Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by El Temür since his more influential brother Kuśala stayed in far-away Central Asia at the time. He was installed as the new ruler in Khanbaliq in September at about the same time Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu. Not everyone who participated in the movement had ties as close as El Temür's to Khayishan's family. The restorationists under El Temür had the extensive human and material resources of the Central Region (under Zhongshu Sheng), Hunan, Jiangzhe, Jiangxi and Huguang provinces whereas the loyalists at Shangdu had the support of only Lingbei, Liaoyang, Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan, all of which were geographically peripheral. Also, Mongolian princes and high-ranking Mongolian officials based in Manchuria (Liaodong) and eastern Mongolia fought on both sides of this civil war.\n\nAt the start of the war, Ragibagh's forces broke through the Great Wall at several points, and penetrated as far as the outskirts of Khanbaliq. El Temür, however, was able to turn the tide quickly in his favor. The restorationists from Manchuria and eastern Mongolia launched a surprise attack on the loyalists. Their army under the command of Bukha Temur and Orlug Temur, descendants of Genghis Khan's brothers, surrounded Shangdu on 14 November, at a time most of the loyalists were involved on the Great Wall front. The loyalists in Shangdu surrendered on the very next day, and Dawlat Shah and most of the leading loyalists were taken prisoner and later executed. Ragibagh was reported to be missing. With the surrender of Shangdu, the way to restoring Khayishan's imperial line was cleared.\n\nHowever, the loyalists elsewhere carried on fighting for much longer. Indeed, the loyalists in Shanxi did not lay down their arms until December 1328, and their counterparts in Sichuan surrendered only in the following month. Early in the next year there was a revolt in Yunnan, where the Prince Tugel declared himself independent. Troops were sent against him, and were ordered to march by the country of Pa fan. With the support of the province's aboriginal tribes, such as the Lolos and other tribes of Miaotze on the borders of Yunnan, Tugel successfully resisted the imperial army. The Yuan army under the command of Temur Buka was defeated, and sent for reinforcements. At that point the Prince Yuntu Temur was ordered to withdraw 20,000 men from the provinces of Jiangzhe, Jiangxi and Henan Jiangbei, and to lead them by way of Huguang towards Yunnan. The last remnants of the loyalists did not give up their cause until 1332.\n"}
