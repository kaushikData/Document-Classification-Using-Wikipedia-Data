It took place on the same day as the Batley and Spen by-election. They were the fifth and sixth by-elections of the 56th UK Parliament.\n\nThe by-election was triggered by the resignation of the sitting Member of Parliament (MP) David Cameron on 12 September 2016. The election was won by Conservative Robert Courts with a reduced majority, and the Liberal Democrats came in second with an increase in vote share of 23.4 percentage points.\n\nDavid Cameron had been the Conservative Party MP for the seat since the 2001 general election, becoming leader of the Conservative Party in 2005 and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in 2010. Following the Leave result in the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union that Cameron had campaigned against, he resigned as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, being replaced by Theresa May. In September 2016 he announced his resignation as an MP saying he did not want to be a distraction to May's premiership.\n\nThe Conservatives picked Robert Courts, a barrister and West Oxfordshire District Councillor since 2014, from a shortlist of three candidates. Though Witney voted in favour of remain in the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, Courts is a \"Brexiter\".\n\nThe Labour Party selected Duncan Enright as their candidate. He serves as a West Oxfordshire District Councillor and stood in Witney at the 2015 general election, finishing second behind Cameron.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats selected Liz Leffman, a West Oxfordshire District Councillor (for Charlbury and Finstock) and local businesswoman, as the party's candidate. She stood in Witney in 2005, finishing second to Cameron.\n\nThe UK Independence Party named Kenrick \"Dickie\" Bird. He served in the army in Oxfordshire's local Regiment, The Royal Green Jackets, before becoming Head Porter at Oriel College, Oxford, and stood in Banbury in 2015, coming third.\n\nThe Green Party named Larry Sanders, a former Oxfordshire County Councillor and brother of US Senator Bernie Sanders. He came fifth in the 2015 general election in the neighbouring constituency of Oxford West and Abingdon.\n\nThe National Health Action Party (NHA) selected Dr Helen Salisbury, an Oxford GP and lecturer at Oxford University Medical School. Salisbury was their candidate in Oxford West & Abingdon at the 2015 general election.\n\nWinston McKenzie, a former professional boxer and a perennial candidate, has been named as the candidate of the English Democrats. He came third in Croydon North at the previous general election.\n\nIndependent candidate Adam Knight endorsed the Liberal Democrat candidate, Leffman, during the campaign.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats recorded their highest share of the vote in Witney since 1983.\n\nThe constituency is co-terminous with the district of West Oxfordshire which, in the EU referendum on 23 June 2016, voted in favour of remain.\n\n"}

{"id": "57214226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57214226", "title": "Alfie Evans case", "text": "Alfie Evans case\n\nThe Alfie Evans case was a legal case in 2018 involving Alfie Evans (9 May 2016 – 28 April 2018), an infant boy from Liverpool with an undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder.\n\nThe medical team and the child's parents disagreed about whether to maintain Evans' life support or to withdraw it, resulting in a legal battle. Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust sought a declaration that continued ventilatory support was \"unkind and inhumane\", and not in Evans' best interests. Alfie's parents, Kate James and Thomas Evans, contested the application.\n\nThe ventilatory support was removed on 23 April 2018 following a series of unsuccessful appeals from Alfie's family. Alfie continued to breathe naturally for five days after the removal of his breathing tube. He died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018.\n\nIn November 2016, at six months of age, Alfie Evans was reviewed at the general pediatric outpatient clinic at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. He was found to be functioning in a range appropriate for a 6-week to 2-month-old infant. On 14 December 2016, Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Accident and Emergency Department with a history of coughing, high temperature, and a reported episode of rhythmic jerking of his jaw and all four limbs. On 15 December, he showed sudden unprovoked movements compatible with infantile/epileptic spasms. An EEG performed on 16 December 2016 confirmed hypsarrhythmia. A further EEG was taken in January 2017 and \"was markedly different, showing attenuation with little in the way of reactive response for protracted periods of time. Changes only really occurred when Alfie had an epileptic seizure.\"\n\nAlfie's parents wished to remove him from Alder Hey and seek further care at the Bambino Gesù Hospital in Rome. In September 2017, Italian doctors from Bambino Gesù Hospital produced an assessment report on the possibility of transferring Alfie to Italy. According to their report on the case, they could offer prolonged ventilator support, with a surgical tracheostomy and would remove a nasogastric tube, replacing it with a gastrostomy. During assessment, Alfie suffered \"epileptic seizures induced by proprioceptive stimuli\", the report warned \"due to stimulations related to the transportation and flight, those seizures might induce further damage to the brain, [putting] the whole procedure of transportation at risk.\" Alfie remained in Alder Hey Hospital for the duration of 2017, with no improvement in his condition. At the end of the year, the hospital applied to have life support switched off.\n\nAlfie Evans' case drew significant public attention in the United Kingdom and overseas, with his parents establishing \"Alfie's Army\", an online campaign group dedicated to seeking further treatment and opposing the withdrawal of life support. Supporters established a petition on change.org, calling on Alder Hey Hospital to allow Alfie Evans to be transferred to a hospital of his parents' choice. His parents also approached Dr Michio Hirano, a US-based neurologist who had offered treatment in the case of Charlie Gard. Alfie's parents claimed a parental right to make decisions about their son's care, arguing that the hospital itself should not be able to make care-decisions for their son without their consent.\n\nLarge protests emerged outside Alder Hey Hospital on 12 April after his family insisted on their right to take him home. On 16 April, Merseyside Police launched an investigation into \"instances of verbal abuse and acts of intimidation\" with judges raising concerns about threatening conduct by protests towards hospital staff. Alfie's parents apologised, saying they did not intend to \"harm or cause conflict or upset\". Merseyside Police Chief Inspector Chris Gibson released a statement regarding social media posts regarding the Alder Hey Hospital and Alfie Evans situation: \"malicious communications and threatening behaviour will be investigated and, where necessary, will be acted upon.\"\n\nOn 18 April 2018 Alfie's father flew to Rome for a 20-minute meeting with Pope Francis. The case was commented on by the Pope via Twitter, who stated his \"sincere hope that everything necessary may be done in order to continue compassionately accompanying little Alfie Evans, and that the deep suffering of his parents may be heard.\" He restated his support after the removal of life support, saying \"Moved by the prayers and immense solidarity shown little Alfie Evans, I renew my appeal that the suffering of his parents may be heard and that their desire to seek new forms of treatment may be granted.\"\n\nThe President of Poland Andrzej Duda also expressed his support. On 23 April, Alfie was granted Italian citizenship under the request of Brothers of Italy's leader Giorgia Meloni. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it hoped Alfie would be allowed \"immediate transfer to Italy\".\n\nOn 19 December 2017, Alder Hey applied to the High Court to withdraw parental rights from Alfie's parents and to withdraw ventilation. The case was heard at a public hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. Alder Hey claimed that continuing life-support treatment would not be in the best interests of Alfie and sought declaration that \"is not lawful that such treatment continue\". Lawyers acting on the hospital's behalf further claimed that further treatment for Alfie would be \"unkind and inhumane\". A doctor treating Alfie further stated that there was \"no hope\" for the child, and that he was in a semi-vegetative state from a degenerative neurological condition that medics have not been able to definitively identify. The parents denied this, with Alfie's father claiming that his son \"looks him in the eye\" and \"wants help\".\n\nThe High Court ruled in favour of the hospital on 20 February 2018. In their judgement, the High Court stated that an MRI scan taken in February 2018 revealed that \"[Alfie's] brain [was] entirely beyond recovery\" and that \"the brain was now only able to generate seizure\" with \"progressive destruction of the white matter of the brain which Dr R interpreted as now appearing almost identical to water and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\" The Court noted that the medical consensus, including of doctors asked to testify by the parents, was that Alfie had a fatal and untreatable condition, but they differed over the best course of action concerning his end-of-life care. High Court judge Mr Justice Anthony Hayden concluded that \"I am satisfied that continued ventilatory support is no longer in Alfie's best interest\".\n\nAlfie's parents appealed against the decision in late February. On 6 March, the Court of Appeal upheld the earlier ruling of the High Court. They stated that the High Court judge was \"meticulous and thorough\", and that medical evidence showed Alfie was \"deeply comatose\" and \"to all intents and purposes unaware of his surroundings\". The parents applied to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom on 20 March, which refused the right for another appeal. On 28 March the European Court of Human Rights ruled the case inadmissible, finding no violation of human rights.\n\nIn a High Court judgement of 11 April 2018, the judge remarked that \"by the end of February the connective pathways within the white matter of the brain which facilitate rudimentary sensation — hearing, touch, taste and sight, had been obliterated. They were no longer even identifiable on the MRI scan\". The High Court backed an end-of-life care plan drawn up by medical specialists attached to Alfie Evans' case.\n\nAlfie's father said that Alfie was wrongly \"detained\" at Alder Hey. High Court judge Hayden dismissed that complaint, and appeal judges upheld his decision. On 17 April Mr Evans and Ms James asked the Supreme Court to consider their case again. Their application to appeal was refused on 20 April. The justices wrote, \"Alfie looks like a normal baby, but the unanimous opinion of the doctors who have examined him and the scans of his brain is that almost all of his brain has been destroyed. No-one knows why. But that it has happened and is continuing to happen cannot be denied. [...] there is no hope of his ever getting better.\" The European Court of Human Rights again determined their appeal on these grounds to be inadmissable.\n\nThe case concerned the family's argument that the prevention of Alfie's transfer from Alder Hey Hospital constituted deprivation of liberty and a violation of Article 5 (right to liberty and security) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The decision resulted in a protest of at least 200 people taking place outside of Alder Hey hospital.\n\nOn 23 April, it was reported that Alfie's life support had been withdrawn. Alfie continued to breathe after the removal of his breathing tube, although his parents gave conflicting reports, at one time claiming they needed to perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Other than a post on social media no evidence of mouth-to-mouth ever being performed has ever been made public. Alfie's father stated to the media the next morning that Alfie had been breathing unassisted since shortly after life-support had been withdrawn, and that life-support should be reinstated. The evening of the same day, High Court judge Justice Hayden rejected the parents' appeal for permission to fly their son to a hospital in Italy. The judge concluded how previously he had come, \"the consensus of every doctor from every country who had ever evaluated Alfie's condition, to the inevitable conclusion (following 7 days of evidence) that Alfie's brain had been so corroded by his Neurodegenerative Brain Disorder that there was simply no prospect of recovery. By the time I requested the updated MRI scan in February, the signal intensity was so bright that it revealed a brain that had been almost entirely wiped out. In simple terms the brain consisted only of water and CSF. [...] All that could be offered by the Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome was an alternative palliative care plan.\" According to the \"Liverpool Echo\", Alfie's father told reporters later that evening that the court had said it could set aside three judges that evening to hear his case again. On 25 April, the appeal was rejected. \n\nAlfie Evans' father sought to issue a private prosecution alleging murder against several staff members at Alder Hey. A statement had been prepared by Pavel Stroilov of the Christian Legal Centre, but was rejected by a district judge. On 26 April, Mr Evans issued a statement, thanking supporters, and staff at Alder Hey Hospital. He stated the family wished to \"form a relationship, build a bridge and walk across it\" with the hospital where their son has been treated and work with the treating team on a \"plan that provides our boy with the dignity and comfort that he needs\".\n\nAlfie died at 2:30 a.m. on 28 April 2018. Later that day his father, Tom Evans, released a statement on Facebook announcing his death: \"My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings... absolutely heartbroken.\"\n"}

The film centers on the story of George Jackson's life.\n\nThe movie covers the last 14 months of George Jackson's life as well as the conditions in California's prison industrial complex. George Jackson would spend 11 years incarcerated (7 of which were in solitary confinement) for a $70 gas station robbery crime in 1960. He was 18 years of age when the sentence of one year-to-life was handed down to him.\n\n\"Black August\" encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The film reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities as well as the Party's influence on prisoners across the country.\n\nAs a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, played by Ezra J. Stanley, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Rafael, California, during a hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers.\n\nThe younger Jackson and three others would be killed, including Superior Judge Harold Haley and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is described as a prison break attempt. After a nationwide manhunt, Angela Davis would be captured and stand trial in connection with the Marin County Court House liberation attempt by Jonathan Jackson, accused of conspiracy in supplying 17-year-old Jonathan Jackson with the weapons used. George Jackson is accused of smuggling a 9mm pistol and extra clips concealed under an Afro-wig, into the prison cellblock following a visit by Attorney Stephen Bingham. Stephen Bingham would leave the country, not returning to face charges until 14 years later. Both, Davis and Bingham would be acquitted.

{"id": "11554561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11554561", "title": "Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock", "text": "Board of Inland Revenue v Haddock\n\nBoard of Inland Revenue v Haddock (also known as the negotiable cow) is a fictitious legal case written by the humorist A. P. Herbert for \"Punch\" magazine as part of his series of \"Misleading Cases in the Common Law\". It was first published in book form in \"More Misleading Cases in the Common Law\" (Methuen, 1930). The case evolved into an urban legend.\n\nThe case involved a Mr Albert Haddock, often an ingenious litigant in Herbert's writing. In this case, Haddock had been in disagreement with the Collector of Taxes over the size of his tax bill. Haddock complained that the sum was excessive, particularly in view of the inadequate consideration he believed that he received from that Government in service. Eventually the Collector demanded £57 and 10 shillings.\n\nHaddock appeared at the offices of the Collector of Taxes and delivered a white cow \"of malevolent aspect\". On the cow was stencilled in red ink:\n\nHaddock tendered the cow in payment of his bill and demanded a receipt.\n\nDuring the hearing, the fictitious judge, Sir Basil String, enquired whether stamp duty had been paid. The prosecutor, Sir Joshua Hoot KC confirmed that a two-penny stamp was affixed to the dexter horn of the cow. The collector declined the cow, objecting that it would be impossible to pay it into a bank account. Haddock suggested that he endorse the cow to a third party to whom he might owe money, adding that \"there must be many persons in that position\".\n\nSir Joshua informed the court that the collector did try to endorse the cheque on its back, in this case on the abdomen. However, Sir Joshua explained: \"[t]he cow ... appeared to resent endorsement and adopted a menacing posture.\"\n\nThe collector abandoned the attempt and declined to take the cheque. Haddock led the cow away and was arrested in Trafalgar Square for causing an obstruction, leading to the co-joined criminal case, R. v Haddock.\n\nHe testified that he had tendered a cheque in payment of income tax. A cheque was only an order to a bank to pay money to the person in possession of the cheque or a person named on the cheque, and there was nothing in law to say it must be on paper of specified dimensions. A cheque, he argued, could be written on notepaper. He said he had \"drawn cheques on the backs of menus, on napkins, on handkerchiefs, on the labels of wine bottles; all these cheques had been duly honoured by his bank and passed through the Bankers’ Clearing House\". He thought that there was no distinction in law between a cheque on a napkin and a cheque on a cow.\n\nWhen asked as to motive, he said he had not a piece of paper to hand. Horses and other animals used to be seen frequently in the streets of London. He admitted on cross-examination that he may have had in his mind an idea to ridicule the taxman. \"But why not? There is no law against ridiculing the income tax.\"\n\nIn relation to the criminal prosecution, Haddock said it was a nice thing if in the heart of the commercial capital of the world a man could not convey a negotiable instrument down the street without being arrested. If a disturbance was caused by a crowd, the policeman should arrest the crowd, not him.\n\nThe judge, sympathetic to Haddock, found in his favour on the tax claim and prosecution for causing a disturbance. By tendering and being refused the cow, the other parties were estopped from then demanding it later.\n\n\"Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock\" was dramatised for BBC television as \"The Negotiable Cow\" as the opening of the first series of \"A. P. Herbert's Misleading Cases\" in 1967, with Roy Dotrice as Albert Haddock and Alastair Sim as Mr Justice Swallow.\n\nAlthough the case is fictitious, it has been referred to in judicial decisions. \n\nIn \"Messing v Bank of America\" (2002) at paragraph 1 the Maryland Court of Appeals observed: \"The circumstances which gave rise to the case before us are, in terms of its genesis, reminiscent of those described in the case of \"Board of Inland Revenue v. Haddock\".\"\n\nIn the English case of Mr Justice Lightman stated that a document, in the context of the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981, \"must be inanimate: neither a person nor A.P. Herbert's 'negotiable cow' can constitute a document.\"\n\nHerbert reported that the now defunct \"Memphis Press-Scimitar\" (formerly published by the E. W. Scripps Company) published an article on the case in 1967, assuming it to have been factual.\n\nNegotiable instruments and other legal documents have been written on unusual surfaces. Documented cases provide illustrations of wills on the side of empty egg-shells, and cheques being written on a variety of strange surfaces. \n\nAn often-cited example is a Canadian farmer who, while trapped under his own tractor, carved a holographic will into the tractor's fender. The fender was probated and stood as his will, and is currently on display at the law library of the University of Saskatchewan College of Law.\n\nIn Jewish law a get can be written on any durable material, including the horn of a cow. If the horn is still attached to the cow, the husband must give the wife the whole cow.\n\nAnother A. P. Herbert \"misleading case\" concerns \"The egg of exchange\". The question there was whether a cheque written on an egg could be paid into a bank, given the risk of the egg breaking or going bad. It was suggested that the cheque could be boiled.\n\nYet another \"misleading case\", also \"Inland Revenue v Haddock\", was cited in a debate in the House of Lords on 14 July 2004. In this, Mr. Haddock successfully argued that, during a period when judges had their salaries reduced by 30% because of financial emergency, they could not hear cases relating to the Inland Revenue because they had a personal interest in the outcome.\n\n"}

At the time it was Britain's largest robbery, netting , equivalent to £ million today. Reynolds spent five years on the run before being sentenced to 25 years in 1969. He was released in 1978. He wrote three books and performed with the band Alabama 3, for whom his son, Nick, plays.\n\nBruce Richard Reynolds was born at Charing Cross Hospital, in the Strand, central London, the only child of Thomas Richard and Dorothy Margaret (née Keen). He was initially brought up in Putney, and his mother, a nurse, died in 1935 when he was aged four. His father, a trade-union activist at the Ford Dagenham assembly plant, married again, and the family moved to Gants Hill. Reynolds found it difficult to live with his father and stepmother, choosing often to stay with one or other of his grandmothers. During the London Blitz of the Second World War he was evacuated to Suffolk and then to Warwickshire.\n\nOn leaving school at 14½, Reynolds failed the eyesight test to join the Royal Navy, and decided he wanted to become a foreign correspondent, so he applied in person for a job at Northcliffe House. Employed first as a messenger boy, he then worked in the accounts department of the \"Daily Mail\". By the age of 17 he had become bored with the routine and was working in the Bland/Sutton Institute of Pathology at Middlesex Hospital, before joining Claud Butler as a bicycle messenger and a member of their semi-professional racing team, where he first met criminals and began a life of crime.\n\nAfter undertaking some petty crime and spending time in HMP Wormwood Scrubs and Borstal for theft (from which he escaped and was eventually caught and sent to Reading Prison), he spent six weeks of the required two years doing National Service in the British Army, before running away to return to petty crime. Sentenced to three years in 1952 for breaking and entering, he was sent to the juvenile wing of Wandsworth Prison in London. He then graduated to jewellery theft from large country houses.\n\nIn 1957 Reynolds was arrested, together with Terry Hogan, for assault and robbery of a bookmaker returning from White City Greyhounds with £500. The police stated their belief that the intent of the cosh attack was grievous bodily harm and not robbery. Hogan was sentenced to 2½ years and Reynolds received a year longer. After spending time in HMP Wandsworth and HMP Durham, on release in 1960 he then became an antiques dealer and thief.\n\nHe joined a gang with future best friend Harry Booth and future brother-in-law John Daly. Later on, he did some work with Jimmy White and met Buster Edwards at Charlie Richardson's club. Richardson in turn introduced him to Gordon Goody. Having gained the moniker \"Napoleon\", in 1962 his gang stole £62,000 in a security van robbery at London Heathrow Airport. They then attempted to rob a Royal Mail train at Swindon, which netted only £700. But Reynolds, now looking for his career-criminal defining moment, started planning his next train robbery over a period of three months.\n\nReynolds organised a gang of 15 men to undertake the 1963 Great Train Robbery (which he later referred to as his \"Sistine Chapel ceiling\"). After the theft, Reynolds spent six months in a mews house in South Kensington waiting for a false passport. He then travelled via Elstree Airfield to Ostend, was then driven to Brussels Airport, before flying with Sabena airlines to Mexico City via Toronto. Assuming the name \"Keith Clement Miller\", he was joined by his wife Frances, who changed her name to Angela, and son Nick.\n\nFor Christmas 1964, the family were joined in Acapulco by fellow train robbers Buster Edwards, who had not yet been caught, and treasurer Charlie Wilson, who had escaped from HMP Winson Green. Reynolds and his family later moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, where Wilson had settled with his family, but a proposed theft of Canadian dollars was stopped due to Royal Canadian Mounted Police observation. Reynolds then moved to Vancouver, before returning that summer to the South of France. By now running low on cash, he heard a similarly sized large robbery was being planned. The family returned to London, before then moving to Torquay, Devon. Assuming the name \"Keith Hiller\", the family began a life of settling into Reynolds' former childhood holiday town, before he had the urge to make contact with his old friends back in London. The Metropolitan Police whilst watching the London criminal scene realised that Hiller was in fact Reynolds, and arrested him in Torquay on 9 November 1968. Offered a deal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales) to plead guilty and avoid their pursuing his son, wife and family on further criminal charges, Reynolds agreed to plead guilty and was sentenced to 25 years. All of the Great Train robbers were held in maximum security in a specially built unit at HMP Durham. After making friends with both Charlie and Eddie Richardson whilst in prison, Reynolds was released from HMP Maidstone in 1978.\n\nAfter a failed attempt in the textile trade, he began trafficking and money laundering for many South London drugs gangs. Arrested for dealing amphetamines, he was jailed in the 1980s for three years.\n\nOn release he gained a profile as a media \"former criminal\" figure, and acted as a consultant on the film \"Buster\", with Larry Lamb portraying Reynolds. Reynolds then published his autobiography \"The Autobiography of a Thief\" (1995). In the book, Reynolds commented that the Great Train Robbery had proved a curse that followed him around, as after it no-one wanted to employ him either legally or illegally:\nHaving either spent or had removed by courts the monies that he gained through crime, by the 1990s Reynolds was living on income support in a flat in Croydon, Greater London, supplied by a charitable trust. Reynolds' wife predeceased him. He died on the afternoon of 28 February 2013 at the age of 81. At the time of his death, Reynolds was working on\" The Great Train Robbery 50th Anniversary:1963–2013\", published by Mpress in July 2013.\n\nMultiple media properties and parodies have been produced about the Great Train Robbery [see Details of the Great Train Robbery and the robbers]. Examples featuring Bruce Reynolds include: \"Die Gentlemen bitten zur Kasse\" (\"The Gentleman Prefers Payment\", also known as \"Great British Train Robbery\") which aired on TV-Dreiteiler in 1966 and featured Horst Tappert as Reynolds, \"Robbery\" (1967) with Stanley Baker as a character based upon Reynolds, and \"Buster\" (1988) with Larry Lamb as Reynolds.\n\nIn 2008, Shaun Micallef parodied Reynolds in Series 2, Episode 9 of an Australian Satirical Comedy News Series Newstopia. In 2012, Reynolds was portrayed in the television series \"Mrs Biggs\" by Jay Simpson.\n\nHe was also the subject of the song \"Have You Seen Bruce Richard Reynolds\", originally by Nigel Denver and later covered by the UK band Alabama 3. Reynolds himself appears on the Alabama 3 version.\n\nOn the day that Biggs died, 18 December 2013, the BBC broadcast the first of a two part series, \"The Great Train Robbery\", which provides a dramatisation of the events first from the criminals' perspective and then from that of the police. The program had already been scheduled for broadcast on that date. Bruce Reynolds was played by Welsh actor Luke Evans.\n"}
{"id": "651199", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=651199", "title": "Cincinnati May Festival", "text": "Cincinnati May Festival\n\nThe Cincinnati May Festival is a two-week annual choral festival, held in May in Cincinnati, Ohio, US.\nThe festival's roots go back to the 1840s, when \"Saengerfests\" were held in that city, bringing singers from all over the United States and abroad to perform large scale classical works of the day.\n\nIn \"A City That Sings,\" we find a description of Cincinnati in the late 1800s: \"In the final decades of the nineteenth century Cincinnati cemented its position as one of America's cultural leaders with the founding of the still flourishing May Festival (1873), the Cincinnati Art Museum (1886) and its neighbor in Cincinnati, the Cincinnati Art Academy (1887), and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (1895).\n\nSinging societies were very popular in the nineteenth century and the tradition was no different in Cincinnati. Both the English and German societies were evident.\nAs a rule, the differences between the two national choral traditions were in language, origin, composition, and social scope. English societies, the earliest of Cincinnati's choral ensembles, existed primarily to make music. The first German society was founded in 1825, but the majority of these organizations arose after an immigration boom in the late 1840s. They provided social opportunities for eating and drinking, as well as making music. Most of the German societies were men's choruses, but women were sometimes admitted, often as non-singing supporting members, in the last half of the century.\n\nIn October 1863, a circular was sent to the 'Musical Public of Cincinnati' to extend a 'cordial invitation to singers, both ladies and gentlemen, who will take an interest in building up a large Choral Society, such as the old societies of Boston and New York, to join.' This mixed chorus approach to presenting oratorio with members drawn from a broad spectrum of Cincinnati's singers regardless of the nationality or society to which they pledged allegiance, must be regarded as an important precedent of the May Festival.\nMaria Longworth Nichols Storer the granddaughter of Nicholas Longworth, a banker and winemaker, and wife of Colonel George Ward Nichols took a trip to England in 1871. There she witnessed one of the large English festivals. At home, Mr. Nichols was a member of the Harmonic Society, so the couple was involved in choral music of the English variety. Mrs. Nichols knew Cincinnati's choral tradition was the perfect place to start a musical festival of their own. She wrote to Theodore Thomas, a renowned American, conductor and asked for a meeting with him on his next visit to Cincinnati.\nHe recounts: 'On my…visit in 1871 [sic—it was 1872] a young married lady, member of one of the leading families, laid before me a plan for a large Musical Festival. She proposed that I should be the conductor of it, saying that I would be responsible for the artistic side, she would find the men who would take charge of the business details. I soon found out that this lady was not only very talented in may ways, but that her taste was not amateurish in anything, and I readily consented to undertake the work she wished me to do.' He agreed to be conductor of the Festival if fifty thousand dollars could be raised for a guarantee fund and a committee could be formed to take care of the business aspects of the event. Mrs. Nichols's biographer, Sr. Rose Angela Boehle, mentions that Maria and Col. Nichols started the guarantee fund of the 1873 Festival with a five-thousand-dollar contribution.\n\nAmong the first actions of the Executive Committee was the hiring of Theordore Thomas as musical director and Carl Barus as director of the chorus. Thomas's touring orchestra would play, as they would continue to do at every festival until 1904. Arthur Mees, a Cincinnati music teacher, was named rehearsal accompanist and later, festival organist. While the artistic forces were almost entirely German, the administrative team that planned the event was mostly of English descent. A circular describing the expectations of chorus members was printed in English and German and distributed to 121 music dealers, 60 post offices, and 144 singing societies. It was also distributed to 1,120 newspapers throughout Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and 'the leading papers of the West.' According to the superintendent of the chorus, Samuel D. Carey, by the time the first performance took place, the chorus had 706 members.\n\n\"The orchestra is German; the music three-fourths German, and the other fourth exotic; scarcely half the singers were native-born; but, despite all this, it is thoroughly American, for nothing but that attenuated and intensified form of Anglo-Saxon called the Yankee could ever have supplied the nerve-force needed to carry on such a mammoth affair.\"\nPerformances included repertoire that was overwhelmingly German. Handel, Bach, Beethoven, Haydn, and Mozart comprised the first two concerts. Of the sixty works on the seven concerts, only five were by composers not born in a German-speaking country. The matinee concerts consisted largely of arias, art songs, and light orchestral works, including isolated movements of symphonies, Strauss waltzes, and overtures. Thomas's evening concerts were more formal and consisted of major vocal and choral works, including Handel's \"Dettingen Te Deum\", scenes from Gluck's \"Orfeo ed Euridice\", and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, along with purely symphonic works and concert arias.\n\nA second May Festival took place at Saengerfest Hall in 1875, and presented the American premieres of Bach's Magnificat and Brahms's Triumphlied. During this festival, Cincinnati's usual springtime thunderstorms pelted the leaky tin roof of the hall with rain and hail, as they had done to a lesser degree in 1873. The cavernous hall acted as a resonating chamber and Thomas had to stop the concerts on more than one occasion to let the storms pass. Two other problems with the hall were mentioned in the press reports of the first festival, which no doubt persisted in 1875. The reporter from the Gazette mentioned that the temperature in the hall was too warm. The situation was 'promptly remedied by a member of the Executive Committee who crashed out the glass from every window whose frame was wedged too tight in its place to be readily removed.' Another problem arose as the audience, estimated at four thousand with two thousand more in the streets, seems to have grown somewhat frustrated by the crowded conditions in the hall and complained that allowing one thousand people to stand in the aisles 'sorely disappoints ticket-holders who selected their seats on the aisles with especial purpose.'\n\nKentucky-born railroad entrepreneur Reuben Springer was so annoyed by the hall problems that he made the initial $125,000 donation to create a matching fund to enable the construction of a new music hall.\n\nThe area chosen for the new Music Hall was close to the Community Hospital, Insane Asylum, and the Pest House . When inmates or patients expired, they were interred in Potter's Field, the present site of Music Hall. Over two hundred wagon loads of bones were moved to Spring Grove Cemetery and reburied in a mass grave. Stories of hauntings in the hall survive to this day.\n\nConstruction for the hall began on May 1, 1877, just a year before the third May Festival was to begin. It was dedicated on May 14 at the first concert of the 1878 May Festival. (125) Tickets for the first festival held in Music Hall were, \"$2 for a single reserved seat, $1 for standing room, and $10 dollars for the entire set of seven concert.\" Cincinnati's May Festival has taken place in Springer Auditorium since 1878.\n\nAfter the death of Theodore Thomas in 1905, the 1906 May Festival featured British composer Sir Edward Elgar conducting his oratorio The Dream of Gerontius at the final concert. … Elgar was the most prominent British composer and much of his music was popular in the U.S. He conducted the second, fifth, and sixth concerts of the festival, and spent the preceding two weeks rehearsing his music with the performers.\n\nTheodore Thomas had previously conducted Gerotius at the 1904 May Festival, and its success and the fame of the composer may have drawn the Board of Directors to consider the composer for a guest conductor and celebrity at the upcoming festival.\n\nEnraging the chorus, Lawrence Maxwell, Jr., vice-president of the May Festival Association stated that he was \"against the giving of the memorial concert, saying that ist had not the sanction of the board, that the program was a log of 'has,' and that it would make Thomas turn in his grave to listen to it.\" …The Festival Board, in an act of either reconciliation or humiliation towards the chorus, planned its own memorial concert to open the 1906 May Festival. The chorus responded in a letter by demanding Maxwell's resignation, adding that \"if the Board of Directors do not find this request acceptable, we find no other course open to us than to insist that this communication shall constitute the resignation of the chorus, to take effect at once.\" The May Festival Chorus was soon disbanded, and the Board of Directors chose Maxwell as the next president of the May Festival Association.\n\nIn the midst of the upheaval, the festival reorganized its board and established a marketing plan for the 1906 concerts to choose \"[Frank] Van der Stucken as festival conductor, and to depend upon Sir Edward Elgar as a foreign attraction.\" Frank van der Stucken was the conductor of the recently formed Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and the board decided that the Cincinnati orchestra would play in the 1906 May Festival for the first time.\n\nThe previous festivals had had open rehearsals and many other public opportunities for Cincinnatians to meet and mingle with the stars, but this would not be the case in 1906. With a completely restructured program, Frank Van der Stucken anticipated rehearsals would be full of personnel problems and musical challenges and considered options that would allow the performers to focus on the music.\n\nThe final concert was held on the same evening, and the program consisted of The Dream of Gerontius followed by Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nHowever, perhaps the appearances of massed school choirs most valued by Cincinnatians were those in the then-biennial May Festivals. At the first May Festivals (1873 and 1875) a large chorus of pupils and teachers from the city's intermediate, secondary, and normal schools presented music learned in their public school classes. Beginning in 1882, planners of the festivals began working student choral ensembles into the regular festival repertoire, such as Bach's St. Matthew Passion, Berlioz's Damnation of Faust, and Te Deum, Handel's Judas Maccabeus, or Rubinstein's Tower of Babel. In 1897 a Children's May Festival, utilizing some 2,000 students from the city schools, presented Franz Abt's Cinderella.\n\nChoruses of school children continue to be welcome participants in such major works as Orff's Carmina Burana, Walton's Belshazzar's Feast, Mahler's Symphony No. 3, and Britten's War Requiem. All these accomplishments would have been impossible had not Cincinnati schools, both public and parochial, introduced music into their curricula.\n\nPerhaps the largest work in the repertoire, Mahler's Symphony No. 8, often called The Symphony of a Thousand, received a then-rare performance at the 1931 festival with a chorus of nine hundred, a massive orchestra, and eight soloists.\n\nAfrican-American composer Robert Nathaniel Dett's oratorio The Ordering of Moses appeared on the 1937 May Festival. In 2014, the May Festival Chorus and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra gave a full performance of the oratorio in Carnegie Hall.\n\nDuring times of war and tragedy, the May Festival has traditionally stepped forward to honor heroes and soothe the pain. During World War II, patriotic music held price of place in 1942 and performers donated their services. All proceeds were given to the Cincinnati War Chest. In 1944 a chorus of Women's Army Corps members from Ft. Campbell, Kentucky, performed Frank Loesser's The WAC Hymn and many soldiers attended the festival. Just one month after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania, the May Festival Chorus traveled to New York's Carnegie Hall to perform Britten's powerful War Requiem with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and James Conlon.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, the problems necessitated a three-year span until the next Festival. And then it was reduced to three concerts with a very much abridged program due to the shortage of paper. The Victory Festival in 1946 opened with the Hallelujah Chorus and the whole program was dedicated to the blessings of peace. The Folk Song Symphony by Roy Harris had 500 high school students singing as their costumes divided the chorus stand into three broad stripes of red, white and blue.\n\nUntil 1967 the May Festival was held every two years with only a few exceptions, but since then it has been given every year.\n\nAdolphus Hailstork also composed 'Earthrise,' a work for double chorus and orchestra commissioned by the May Festival in 2006 to promote healing following the 2000 riots. The piece featured a white chorus on one side of the risers and an African American chorus on the other side, who by the end form a visual metaphor by interweaving to create a racially harmonic gesture.\n\nMay Festival opened its doors to African American singers in 1956.\n\nThe all-volunteer May Festival Chorus has been under the direction of Robert Porco since 1989. The chorus rehearses on Tuesday evenings during the academic year from 7-10pm. The chorus performs regularly with the Cincinnati Symphony and Pops Orchestras, singing at Music Hall (Cincinnati) as well as Riverbend Music Center. The May Festival Chorus has garnered critical acclaim for its high level of performance. The May Festival Chamber Chorus performs at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in northern Kentucky during the annual May Festival and at various community concerts throughout the year. \n\nIn addition, in 1986 the May Festival Youth Chorus was formed. Made up of youth from area high-schools, the MFYC is conducted by James Bagwell and gives its members (who must audition competitively) the opportunity to perform challenging music well above the average high school level. The MFYC also has the opportunity to perform with the adult May Festival throughout the year, most notably during May Festival.\n\nOn December 5, 2017, the Cincinnati May Festival canceled conductor James Levine’s appearance in May 2018, after he was accused by four males of sexual abuse.\n\nMusic Directors\nNote: In 1952, Thor Johnson, Jean Morel and Fritz Stiedry were guest conductors. No \"Music Director\" was designated. \nIn 1965, Stanislaw Skrowaczewski and Robert Shaw were guest conductors. No \"Music Director\" was designated.\n\nChorus Masters\n\"°For some Festivals, no chorus master was designated. An \"assistant music director\" was designated instead.\"\n\nBetween 1905 and 1946, music directors of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (founded in 1895) also were engaged as music director of the biannual choral festival (Frank Van der Stucken, Ernst Kunwald, Eugène Ysaÿe, Fritz Reiner, and Eugene Goosens held the reins during those years). Fritz Busch and Josef Krips led festivals between 1948 and 1960.\n\nWith the appointment of Max Rudolf as director of the festival in 1963, the festival became an annual event in 1967, as it is today. In the 1970s, the centennial of both the festival (1973) and Music Hall (1978) was celebrated with the tenures of Julius Rudel (director from 1971 to 1973) and James Levine (1974 to 1978). James Conlon became director in 1979.\n\nWhen Leonard Bernstein conducted the festival in its centennial year, he ascribed the true strength of the endeavor with his typical aplomb:\n\n"}

Beheler\" (in regards to what constitutes custody in the requirement to read Miranda rights) but also in other federal court cases related to Miranda law and definition of custody. Although Miranda law has roughly defined custody as the \"formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement,\" colloquial language may be less restrictive in the use of custody and is thus sometimes difficult to distinguish from the process of arrest. In addition to collecting data on those who have died in custody, the Bureau of Justice Statistics also tracks all deaths related to arrest. This aids in collecting data from the fringes of custody or attempts to arrest an individual.\n\nThe causes for death in police custody may range from suspected homicide by members of the police, killings by other inmates, death due to psychological or physical abuse, capital punishment, to suicide, accidental death, or natural causes. The United States Bureau of Justice Statistics collects data regarding both the cause of death, as well as medical and criminal records of those that die in police custody (restricted to those in federal prison and local jails).\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 17,358 individuals in custody died during the period from 2007-2010. Other publications focus on the rate per 100,000. US jails report deaths that total a mortality rate of 128, and prisons at 264 per 100,000. There are differences in methodology used to obtain these statistics, as some jurisdictions include deaths during attempted arrests, while others do not. \n\nOther research has focused on specific states, such as Maryland and the rate of death by identity (gender, race, age). Based on some findings, African-American males appear to be over-represented as victims of sudden custody deaths. Firther research with larger sample sizes is necessary.\n\nThe Marshall Project collects and produces reports on police killings as well as maintaining a curated list of links to articles and publications related to death in police custody in the United States.\n\n\nThere are numerous laws and international treaties regarding treatment of foreigners, especially during wartime, of which the Geneva Convention is the most widely recognized and internationally ratified. It contains provisions that classify and define both prisoners of war (as well as civilians and the wounded or infirm) and the manner in which they are to be treated. These include but are not limited to: murder, mutilation, hostage taking, and outrages upon personal dignity. These ratified documents are the base of US international custody law and can be seen to be misapplied in some of the proceeding cases.\n\n\nSee Human rights in Vietnam\n\nSee Human rights in Yemen\n\nSee Human rights in Zimbabwe\n\n"}
{"id": "4205756", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4205756", "title": "Dolphin drive hunting", "text": "Dolphin drive hunting\n\nDolphin drive hunting, also called dolphin drive fishing, is a method of hunting dolphins and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.\n\nDespite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.\n\nWhaling in the Faroe Islands takes the form of beaching and slaughtering long-finned pilot whales. It has been practiced since about the time of the first Norse settlements on these North Atlantic islands, and thus can be considered aboriginal whaling. It is mentioned in the Sheep Letter, a Faroese law from 1298, a supplement to the Norwegian Gulating law. It is regulated by the Faroese authorities. Around 800 long-finned pilot whales and some Atlantic white-sided dolphins are slaughtered annually, mainly during the summer. The hunts, called \"grindadráp\" in Faroese, are non-commercial and are organized on a community level. Anyone who has a special training certificate on slaughtering a pilot whale with the spinal-cord lance can participate. This was not necessary earlier, but because of constant criticism from animal welfare organizations, the Faroese people try to improve the slaughtering methods in order to make them more humane. The Grind law was updated in 2015, where one of the regulations demanded that the whalers followed a course on how to slaughter a pilot whale with the spinal-cord lance. The police and Grindaformenn are allowed to remove people from the grind area. The hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of boats. The boats then drive the pilot whales into a bay or to the bottom of a fjord. Not all bays are certified, and the slaughter will only take place on a certified beach.\n\nMany Faroese consider the whale meat an important part of their food culture and history. Animal rights groups criticize the slaughter as being cruel and unnecessary. In November 2008, Høgni Debes Joensen, chief medical officer of the Faroe Islands and Pál Weihe, scientist, have recommended in a letter to the Faroese government that pilot whales should no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the high level of mercury, PCB and DDT derivatives. However, the Faroese government did not forbid whaling. On 1 July 2011 the Faroese Food and Veterinary Authority announced their recommendation regarding the safety of eating meat and blubber from the pilot whale, which was not as strict as the one of the chief medical officer. The new recommendation says only one dinner with whale meat and blubber per month, with a special recommendation for younger women, girls, pregnant women and breastfeeding women. From 2002 to 2009 the PCB concentration in whale meat has fallen by 75%, DDT values in the same time period have fallen by 70% and mercury levels have also fallen.\n\nIn mid-1950s, fishermen in Iceland requested assistance from the government to remove killer whales from Icelandic waters as they damaged fishing equipment. With fisheries accounting for 20% of Iceland's employment at the time, the perceived economic impact was significant. The Icelandic government asked the United States for assistance. As a NATO ally with an air base in Iceland, the US Navy deployed Patrol Squadrons VP-18 and VP-7 to achieve this task. According to the US Navy, hundreds of animals were killed with machineguns, rockets and depth charges.\n\nIn the late 1970s, after the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and the ban on hunting killer whales in Washington in 1976 as discussed later in this article, the hunting of killer whales in Iceland resumed, this time aiming to capture live animals for the entertainment industry. The first two Killer Whales captured went to Dolfinarium Harderwijk in the Netherlands. One of these animals was soon after transferred to SeaWorld. These captures continued until 1989, with the additional animals going to SeaWorld, Marineland Antibes, Marineland Canada, Kamogawa Sea World, Ocean Park Hong Kong and Conny-Land.\n\nAlthough commercial whaling does still take place in Icelandic waters today, dolphins are no longer hunted and whale watching is popular amongst tourists.\n\nThe Taiji dolphin drive hunt captures small cetaceans for their meat and, latterly, for sale to dolphinariums.Taiji has a long connection to Japanese whaling. The 2009 documentary film \"The Cove\" drew international attention to the hunt. Taiji is the only town in Japan where drive hunting still takes place on a large scale. Concern is majority through the methodology of the hunt, as actions are viewed as inhumane. An article by \"National Geographic\" refers to The Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums' decision to no longer support the Taiji hunt. In 2015, it was announced that there would be a ban in the buying and selling of dolphins through the means of this hunt.\n\nSimilar drive hunting existed in Kiribati at least until the mid 20th century.\n\nThough it is forbidden under Peruvian law to hunt dolphins or eat their meat (sold as \"chancho marino\", or \"sea pork\" in English), \na large number of dolphins are still killed illegally by fishermen each year. To catch the dolphins, they are driven together with boats and encircled with nets, then harpooned, dragged on to the boat, and clubbed to death if still alive. Various species are hunted, such as the Bottlenose and Dusky Dolphin. \n\nAccording to estimates from local animal welfare organisation Mundo Azul released in October 2013, between 1,000 and 2,000 dolphins are killed annually for consumption, with a further 5,000 to 15,000 being killed for use as shark bait. Sharks are captured both for their meat and for use of their fins in shark fin soup.\n\nDolphin are hunted in Malaita, in the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific, mainly for their meat and teeth, and also sometimes for live capture for dolphinariums. The hunt on South Malaita Island is smaller in scale than Tajai. After capture, the meat is shared equally between households. Dolphin teeth are also used in jewelry and as currency on the island.\n\nOn the Penghu Islands in Taiwan, drive fishing of Bottlenose Dolphins was practiced until 1990, when the practice was outlawed by the government. Mainly Indian Ocean Bottlenose Dolphins but also common Bottlenose Dolphins were captured in these hunts.\n\nFrom 1644 at Southampton, New York, on Long Island, the colonists established an organised whale fishery, chasing pilot whales (\"blackfish\") onto the shelving beaches for slaughter. They also processed drift whales they found on shore. They observed the Native Americans hunting techniques, improved on their weapons and boats, and then went out to ocean hunting.\n\nIn ancient Hawaii, fishermen occasionally hunted dolphins for their meat by driving them onto the beach and killing them. In their ancient legal system, dolphin meat was considered to be \"kapu\" (forbidden) for women together with several other kinds of food. Today, dolphin drive hunting no longer takes place in Hawaii.\n\nHunting dolphins (at the time still often incorrectly referred to as fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along the shores of the Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. The brutality of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.\n\nDrive hunting methods were used to capture Orcas in the Puget Sound in the 1960s and 1970s. These hunts were led by aquarium owner and entrepreneur Edward \"Ted\" Griffin and his partner Don Goldsberry. After Edward purchased an Orca that was caught by accident by fishermen in Namu, British Columbia, in 1965, Edward and Don used drive hunting techniques in the Puget Sound area to capture Orcas for the entertainment industry. Others followed and despite the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 the practice continued until 1976 when the state of Washington ordered the release of a number of Orcas that were being held in Budd Inlet and subsequently banned the practice.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "151586", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151586", "title": "Eddystone Lighthouse", "text": "Eddystone Lighthouse\n\nThe Eddystone Lighthouse is on the dangerous Eddystone Rocks, south of Rame Head, England, United Kingdom. While Rame Head is in Cornwall, the rocks are in Devon and composed of Precambrian gneiss.\n\nThe current structure is the fourth to be built on the site. The first and second were destroyed by storm and fire. The third, also known as Smeaton's Tower, is the best known because of its influence on lighthouse design and its importance in the development of concrete for building. Its upper portions have been re-erected in Plymouth as a monument. The first lighthouse, completed in 1699, was the world's first open ocean lighthouse although the Cordouan lighthouse preceded it as the first offshore lighthouse.\n\nThe Eddystone Rocks are an extensive reef approximately 12 miles (19 km) SSW of Plymouth Sound, one of the most important naval harbours of England, and midway between Lizard Point, Cornwall and Start Point. They are submerged at high spring tides and were so feared by mariners entering the English Channel that they often hugged the coast of France to avoid the danger, which thus resulted not only in shipwrecks locally, but on the rocks of the north coast of France and the Channel Islands. Given the difficulty of gaining a foothold on the rocks particularly in the predominant swell it was a long time before anyone attempted to place any warning on them.\n\nThe first lighthouse on Eddystone Rocks was an octagonal wooden structure built by Henry Winstanley. The lighthouse was also the first recorded instance of an offshore lighthouse. Construction started in 1696 and the light was lit on 14 November 1698. During construction, a French privateer took Winstanley prisoner and destroyed the work done so far on the foundations, causing Louis XIV to order Winstanley's release with the words \"France is at war with England, not with humanity\".\n\nThe lighthouse survived its first winter but was in need of repair, and was subsequently changed to a dodecagonal (12 sided) stone clad exterior on a timber framed construction with an octagonal top section as can be seen in the later drawings or paintings. This gives rise to the claims that there have been five lighthouses on Eddystone Rock. Winstanley's tower lasted until the Great Storm of 1703 erased almost all trace on 27 November. Winstanley was on the lighthouse, completing additions to the structure. No trace was found of him, or of the other five men in the lighthouse.\n\nThe cost of construction and five years' maintenance totalled £7,814 7s.6d, during which time dues totalling £4,721 19s.3d had been collected at one penny per ton from passing vessels.\nFollowing the destruction of the first lighthouse, Captain John Lovett acquired the lease of the rock, and by Act of Parliament was allowed to charge passing ships a toll of one penny per ton. He commissioned John Rudyard (or Rudyerd) to design the new lighthouse, built as a conical wooden structure around a core of brick and concrete. A temporary light was first shone from it in 1708 and the work was completed in 1709. This proved more durable, surviving nearly fifty years.\n\nOn the night of 2 December 1755, the top of the lantern caught fire, probably through a spark from one of the candles used to illuminate the light. The three keepers threw water upwards from a bucket but were driven onto the rock and were rescued by boat as the tower burnt down. Keeper Henry Hall, who was 94 at the time, died from ingesting molten lead from the lantern roof. A report on this case was submitted to the Royal Society by physician Edward Spry, and the piece of lead is now in the collections of the National Museums of Scotland.\n\n The third lighthouse marked a major step forward in the design of such structures.\n\nRecommended by the Royal Society, civil engineer John Smeaton modelled the shape on an oak tree, built of granite blocks. He pioneered 'hydraulic lime', a concrete that cured under water, and developed a technique of securing the granite blocks using dovetail joints and marble dowels. Construction started in 1756 at Millbay and the light was first lit on 16 October 1759.\n\nSmeaton's lighthouse was 59 feet (18 m) high and had a diameter at the base of 26 feet (8 m) and at the top of 17 feet (5 m).\n\nIn 1841 major renovations were made, under the direction of engineer Henry Norris of Messrs. Walker & Burges, including complete repointing, replacement water tanks and filling of a large cavity in the rock close to the foundations. It remained in use until 1877 when erosion to the rocks under the lighthouse caused it to shake from side to side whenever large waves hit. Smeaton's lighthouse was rebuilt on Plymouth Hoe, in Plymouth, as a memorial. William Tregarthen Douglass supervised the dismantling and removal of Smeaton's Tower. The re-erected tower on the Hoe is now a tourist attraction.\n\nThe foundations and stub of the tower remain, close to the new and more solid foundations of the current lighthouse – the foundations proved too strong to be dismantled so the Victorians left them where they stood.\n\nAn 1850 replica of Smeaton's lighthouse, Hoad Monument, stands above the town of Ulverston, Cumbria as a memorial to naval administrator Sir John Barrow.\nThe current, fourth, lighthouse was designed by James Douglass, using Robert Stevenson's developments of Smeaton's techniques. By April 1879 the new site, on the South Rock was being prepared during the 3½ hours between ebb and flood tide. The supply ship \"Hercules\" was based at Oreston, now a suburb of Plymouth, and the stone was prepared at the Oreston yard and supplied from the works of Messrs Shearer, Smith and Co of Wadebridge.\n\nThe light was lit in 1882 and is still in use. It was automated in 1982, the first Trinity House 'Rock' (or offshore) lighthouse to be converted. The tower has been changed by construction of a helipad above the lantern, to allow maintenance crews access. The helipad has a weight limit of 3600kg.\n\nThe tower is high, and its white light flashes twice every 10 seconds. The light is visible to , and is supplemented by a foghorn of 3 blasts every 62 seconds.\n\n\n\nJohn Smeaton – A Narrative of the Building and Description of the Eddystone Lighthouse with Stone – London 1793\n\nPalmer, Mike; Eddystone, The Finger of Light – First published by Palmridge Publishing in 1998 – Revised edition published in 2005 by Seafarer Books & Globe Pequot Press / Sheridan House – Copyright © 2005 by Mike Palmer All rights reserved – \n\nEddystone The Finger of Light is also a revised Kindle ebook edition, which was released on March 29, 2016.\n\n"}

Used as a pre-war Naval Air Station, the United States Army Air Forces leased the municipal airfield and built an Air Force Plant and modification center for North American B-25 Mitchell medium bomber production. Military use of the site continued as late as 1957 by the Strategic Air Command's 3903rd Radar Bomb Scoring Group for bombing practice.\n\nThe airfield was first used in 1921 for an air meet and became the 1925 Sweeney Airport and the 1928 Fairfax Airport. A naval reserve air base was established at Fairfax Field in 1935; a Navy squadron and a Marine squadron were established on July 12. In 1937 Fairfax acted as an \"army reserve base\" with Douglas O-46 observation planes, and by 1938 the airport had four runways, including one long. Fairfax's \"U.S. Naval Reserve aviation base\", had a 30-day pre-flight training course in 1940.\n\nThe \"Marine Air Flight Program\" established by 1 September 1940 at Fairfax's \"Navy Elimination Air Base\" (E-base) used \"a physical and mental examination…ten hours of dual instruction…check rides and a fifteen-minute solo flight\" for screening candidates to become Naval Aviation Cadets. A Fairfax \"naval flying cadet… crashed into the Missouri river two miles northwest of the Fairfax air base\" [sic] on 16 June 1942, Fairfax's naval aviation training moved in July to the new United States Naval Aviation Reserve Base at Olathe about 20 miles away. Fairfax still had \"Barracks U.S. Navy\" in 1946.\n\nSurvey work for Air Force Plant NC had begun in December 1940, and the city of Kansas City, Kansas, purchased the airport in February 1941. The USAAF leased the Fairfax Airport from the city and the Works Projects Administration sponsored expansion of the four civilian runways. The government purchased a alfalfa field for the plant and for right-of-way to the airfield. B-25 production began in December 1941, and Fairfax's first B-25D was accepted in February 1942. The Fairfax Modification Center was a dual hangar built May–October 1942 along the south taxiway for altering the new B-25s (a west extension and several outbuildings were added.) The 76th AAF Technical Training Detachment activated on 4 February 1943 (designated 5 October) and administered a 6 week hydraulics course for AAF mechanics under the direction of the Aircraft Accessories Corporation. About 300 students were admitted before the school was closed in October as a duplicate of a Chanute Field course. The 81st AAF Technical Training Detachment activated 22 February 1943 and designated, effective 30 August, to supervise apprentice crew chiefs at the Modification Center. January AAF policy was for each mechanic selected as a crew chief to be assigned an aircraft as it left the factory, review its modifications at the center, and deploy with it to the field unit. B-25 modifications only took a week until the B-25G gunship modifications for Pacific War anti-shipping missions, which took 2–3 months. Peak enrollment was 296 mechanics on 27 June, and the apprenticeship program was abandoned (the detachment inactivated on 31 October 1943.)\n\nAir Transport Command moved the 2d Ferrying Squadron of the 5th Ferrying Group from Dallas Love Field to Fairfax on April 15, 1943, and the squadron ferried out 157 B-25s during May Of 1,881 deliveries in 1943 by the Ground Ferrying Squadron all but 129 were B-25s, but at the end of that year Fairfax pilots began ferrying Martin B-26 Marauders from the Omaha modification center and Consolidated B-24 Liberators from a St. Paul facility. From May-Sep 1944 a detachment of Women Airforce Service Pilots was at Fairfax. The 33d Ferrying Group was designated on 1 April 1944 from the 2d Ferrying Squadron, which had been separated from the 5th Group on 1 January 1944 (393 officers and 578 enlisted men at the end of 1944). Womens Air Service Pilots were organized at Fairfax on 1 May 1944, and from Fairfax the 33d delivered 6,202 aircraft to CONUS bases and 251 abroad. On 22 September 1944 the 33d Ferrying Group began daily scheduled Military Air Transport (MAT) flights with military cargo/passengers to Minneapolis and Omaha (2 more daily flights were later added.) In October 1944, the modification center became an adjunct to the final assembly line. On 9 November 1944 the 33d Group furnished plane and crew to fly Senator Harry S. Truman from Fairfax to Washington for ceremonies following his election as Vice-President, and in early 1945 the 33d controlled ten operating locations.. During the Fairfax transition to P-80 production, the 33d Ferrying Group was discontinued.\n\nOn 2 March 1945, Military Air Transport moved an air freight terminal to Fairfax from Kansas City, Missouri, and had 362 personnel in June, the largest operating location in the division. For ferrying, Fairfax became an operating location of Rosecrans Army Airfield on 15 April 1945 with its pilots traveling to Fairfax for sorties. In 1945, 1,044 military transports used the field in July (e.g., President Truman for visits to Independence, Missouri). Plans for B-29 and F-80 aircraft production at Fairfax were never implemented, and B-25J production was terminated on August 15, 1945, after a total of 2,290 B-25Ds (152 Navy PBJ-1D variants) and 4,318 B-25Js had been built by the plant. The federal Reconstruction Finance Corporation set up a depot in the Fairfax district to liquidate war surplus not sent to depots or elsewhere for government use (reusable materials like aluminum and steel were reclaimed.) Seventy-two incomplete but flyable B-25Js were sold to the public. A USAAF C-47 crashed on September 15, 1945 on take off into the north bank of the Missouri River's curve, killing all 24 aboard. The Air Transport Command operating location at Fairfax was discontinued by 6 December 1945 (9 C-47s and 80 pilots/co-pilots transferred west to Topeka Army Airfield which had been chosen for a central MAT flight facility by November 1945.) The 4101st Army Air Force Base Unit (Reserve Training) was activated at Fairfax on 12 July 1946 (redesignated 2472d AF Reserve Training Center on 28 August 1948) and at the beginning of USAF planning, Fairfax activated the Reserve's 564th Bombardment Squadron on 6 January 1947 which sent 127 pilots to 1948 summer camp.\n\nFairfax in 1945 had an early 2AF Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) site which used an SCR-584 radar for evaluating bomber training The Kansas City RBS unit became a detachment of Colorado Springs's 206 AAFBU in July 1945, and in 1954 was Det 5 of the 10th RBSS. The detachment scored Convair B-36 Peacemaker runs during 1953, the 1955 SAC Bombing and Navigation Competition, and the 1957 \"Operation Longshot\". The Kansas City aiming point for the 1957 operation was \"the base of the northeast corner of the Columbian Steel Tank Company\" at the corner of 12th/Liberty streets. in the West Bottoms. In 1959, SAC's simulated bomb runs on Kansas City were scored using a longer range radar at Missouri's Joplin Radar Bomb Scoring Site (10RBSS Det 2) to the south which had moved from Oklahoma's Hollis Radar Bomb Scoring Site in July.\n\nIn October 1948, 37 Air Force Reserve planes at Fairfax flew 1,844 hours and in 1949, the 564th was replaced by the 442d Troop Carrier Wing (activated 27 June). Despite a 1948 plan for Fairfax to \"be withdrawn from surplus\", in \"October 1949 the U.S. Air Force terminated its lease on Fairfax Airport, and the city of Kansas City, Kansas, regained control of the facility\". On May 22, 1950, Fairfax's 2472d AF Reserve Training Center and 442d Troop Carrier Wing moved to Naval Air Technical Training Center Olathe.\n\nFairfax's 4610th Air Base Squadron temporarily evacuated Fairfax Municipal Airport due to a fire during the Great Flood of 1951 and on 1 October 1952, the squadron \"opened\" the nearby Grandview Air Force Base in Missouri (Grandview's beneficial occupancy began 2 years later.) In 1952 the squadron was renamed the 4676th Air Defense Group which began flying F-86 Sabres from Fairfax at the end of 1953.\n\nIn 1953, a F-94 crashed on attempting a return, killing the pilot and radar operator. From 18 December 1953 – 1 March 1954, the 326th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was assigned to Fairfax, and a F-84 crashed near the city's business district killing the pilot and three residents.\n\nOn September 1, 1954, Air Defense Command (ADC) was placed under Continental Air Defense Command and all Fairfax ADC units moved nearby to the new Grandview Air Force Base near Kansas City, Missouri.\n\n"}

The book was soft launched by unveiling the cover of the book by Sanjay Dixit with the publishers Bloomsbury Publishing on 18 November 2017 in the second edition of The Jaipur Dialogues event. The book has now been published on 29th May 2018. The sub-title of the book was initially publicised as \"Rationalist of Vrishnis\", but has now been changed to \"The Truth of Vrishnis\". According to Dixit, the book aims to explore Krishna's life events from a rational perspective.\n\n\"Krishna Gopeshvara\" follows the trend of historical fictions made popular by Amish Tripathi with his Shiva Trilogy and Ram Chandra Series. It is an action packed thriller set in the Mahabharata era.\n\nAccording to Dixit, the book is an attempt to create a logical explanation around the engaging persona of arguably the most complex of characters in the Hindu pantheon. During the launch of the book, he stated that there is much truth in the saying that 'Listen to Krishna, but follow Rama'. He said in the soft launch that Rama was a linear personality who set examples of his own conduct for others to follow, whereas Krishna was in a higher state of evolution as Yogeshvara whose actions cannot be easily understood or followed by lay people, but his teachings are in an exalted state which can be followed by everyone from Yogi to Gopi.\n\nAccording to Amazon, \"'Krishna Gopeshvara' is first part of a trilogy on Lord Krishna. It covers the life events of Lord Krishna from roughly Kansa's capture of the Mathura throne, to Kansa's killing by Krishna. It is written in the genre of historical fiction. Krishna and Kansa are not presented as some extra-terrestrial beings, but as human beings pursuing their narratives according to their understanding of the world around them. The script is presented\nas a clash of two narratives - one the dharmic narrative symbolized by Krishna, and the other being a totalitarian narrative symbolized by Kansa. Radha comes in as an inspiration to the young Krishna.\n\nThe story is presented as a rational explanation of events around Krishna's early life. Things that look impossible to an ordinary person have been reconfigured as plausible events. The only assumption that has been made is that Krishna was a highly gifted young man.\n\nFictional characters have been added to enhance the totalitarian narrative espoused by Kansa. However, the script never leaves the template of history and geography of Aryavarta in the Mahabharata times. Care has been taken that the philosophy associated with Sanatana Dharma comes out in small conversations.\"\n\nIn an interview given to Swarajya (magazine), Dixit refuted the charge that by attacking violent monotheism of Kutila Dharma, he was indirectly hinting at something. He stated in the interview that tendency for using violence to deify is as old as Hiranyakashipu in the Indian tradition, so it is wrong to say that violent monotheism did not exist in the ancient era. He made a distinction between monism and monotheism and between monotheism and violent monotheism.\n\nThere is a minor controversy over the way the Swastika is depicted on the cover, being anti-clockwise instead of the usual auspicious clockwise depiction. When asked, Dixit refused to reveal the reason before the book hits the market. Rather enigmatically, he said that one would have to read the book to know the reason. He said that at this point, he would not like to unravel the mystery behind the reverse Swastika. \n\nHowever, in a pre-order launch carnival held in Jaipur on 13 April 2018, Dixit rebutted the criticism by saying that Vilom Swastika or Reverse Swastika was very much part of the Indian tradition. A video of the discussion during the event was released by Dixit for clarifying some of the mysteries surrounding the book.\n\nThe book was launched on 3rd June 2018 by the Indian Premier League superstar Rishabh Pant and the author Sanjay Dixit\nThe book is now readily available in stock at all major bookstores and online marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal. The book is priced at INR 399.\n\nThe book is also available at all major e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Snapdeal.\n\nDixit had revealed that the Book contains 6 Parts and 51 Chapters. The foreword has been written by David Frawley.\n\nThe Book has an interesting Sanskrit shloka below the sub-title which is a straight take on the last shloka of the Bhagwadgita: \n\n'यत्र गोपेश्वर: कृष्णो यत्र राधा योगिनी।\nतत्र मुक्तिरानंदम् ध्रुवाप्रीतिर्मतिर्मम।।'\n\n'yatra gopeshvarah krishṇo yatra rādhā yogini/\n\ntatra muktirānaṅdam dhruvāpritirmatirmama'\n\nTranslation: Where there is Krishna, the lord of the cowherds, and where there is Radha the practitioner of yoga; there in my opinion you will get liberation, bliss, and a firm feeling of love.\n\nA video has been released by The Jaipur Dialogues that showcases an in-depth discussion on the book featuring David Frawley, Sandeep Balakrishna and Sanjay Dixit; with questions asked by Sonal Mansingh among others.\n\nThe next two books in the Krishna Trilogy are going to be \"Krishna Yogeshvara\" and \"Krishna Gyaneshvara\".\n\nThe 51 Chapters of the book begin with a Chapter titled 'Asti and Prapti' in which the two queens of Kaṃsa are shown fleeing Mathura to the safety of the kingdom of their father, Jarasandha. Once they reach their father's place, the story of Krishna is narrated by the patron sage of Magadha. The book uses two streams of narration in third person. Kaṃsa is tutored by an evil saint called Kuṭil Muni into a totalitarian doctrine called Kuṭil Dharma that was alien to Bharatavarsha. \n\nThe Chapters are divided into six parts. The book ends with the young Krishna preparing to leave for his higher education to the Ashram of his future Guru, Sandipani. The next part of the Trilogy, \"Krishna Yogeshvara\" would presumably have this ending dovetailed at some point.\n\nThe first Part deals with the flight of Mathura queens, wives of Kaṃsa to their paternal home in Magadha and start of the story of Kaṃsa's accession to the throne.\n\nThe second Part deals with the formal introduction of Kuṭil Muni into the story, and his travel to Āryāvarta for conquest and establishment of his narrative.\n\nThe third part deals with Krishna's early childhood.\n\nThe fourth Part deals with Kaṃsa coming increasingly under the influence of the evil narrative of his newfound mentor, Kuṭil Muni.\n\nThe fifth Part deals with Krishna's early adolescence and Kaṃsa's anxiety, leading to Kaṃsa's slaying by Krishna.\n\nThe sixth Part deals with the aftermath of Kaṃsa's death. The book ends with Uddhava preparing to go to Vrindavana to console the Gopis before Krishna leaves Mathura for his higher education to Sandipani Ashrama\n\nSwarajya magazine carried the first review of the book written by Aravindan Neelakandan. Aravindan sees the book as an important literary attempt to look at the life of Sri Krishna as told in Bhagavata, and which reflects the present problems faced by the Hindus. Writing as 'The Avatar Versus the Prophet', Aravindan says that \"The book is an important literary attempt to look at the life of Sri Krishna as told in Bhagavata from the perspective of the clash of religions as is happening in India right now. So Kamsa, the maternal uncle of Krishna, is transformed into a veritable Constantine running an inquisition for Kutil Muni who in turn is an expansionist predatory cultist. His religion is based on intolerant premises – no image worship, destruction of temples, apocalypse, last day, final judgment, eternal hell - not for bad behaviour but for disbelief in the cult and so on. He spreads his cult through the monarch Kamsa. ‘One God, One Book, One King’ is surely a great way to control people, and every dictator of pre-monotheist society would love to have such a weapon handed over to him. Kamsa is no exception and there is one danger to this great plan to make entire ‘Aryavarta’ fall into submission unto the one god (and hence one emperor and his dynasty). A lovable dark hued cowherd among a pastoral community poses a threat. The novel in the form of a narration goes through the different deeds of Krishna – removing the supernatural elements and substituting them with natural explanations\".\n\nHe goes to on to say that \"This first literary attempt by the author is in a way looking at the present existential problems faced by Hindus through the ancient history of Krishna. One example: the way Kutil Muni tries to use the Arya-Naga divide to convert the Nagas shows how the author sees through the Bhagavata – the present day challenge the dharmic society faces – particularly when evangelising religions use the social fault lines to further their agenda. The Nagas when at last faced with the rapine predatory Kutil dharma, realise that they have more in common with the so-called Arya dharma than with the expansionist monocultural Kutil dharma. The more than 300 pages novel is filled with such parallels\".\n\nAravindan concludes by saying that \"what makes this interpretation important is the fact that the dharmic society is facing relentless attacks from the Kutil-dharma like cult-like religions. So this interpretation of Krishna, which has been implicit or involuted in the Bhagavata itself, has been expanded and presented in a modern literary form by Sanjay Dixit in an interesting way. Krishna in Bhagavata is all these and much more. He is of infinite possibilities and he can manifest through infinite ways to provide solutions to the crises that the dharmic society faces\".\n"}

The event encourages thinking about the environment, peace and human rights.\n\nEarly-grade elementary students often create drawings for the holiday and give them as gifts to local kōbans (neighborhood police stations).\n\nLabor Thanksgiving Day is the modern name for an ancient harvest festival known as , celebrating the harvest of the Five Cereals (rice, barley/wheat, foxtail millet, barnyard millet, proso millet, and beans). The classical chronicle the \"Nihon Shoki\" mentions a harvest ritual having taken place during the reign of the legendary Emperor Jimmu (660–585 BC), as well as more formalized harvest celebrations during the reign of Emperor Seinei (480–484 AD). Modern scholars can date the basic forms of \"niiname-sai\" to the time of Emperor Tenmu (667–686 AD). Traditionally, it celebrated the year's hard work; during the \"Niiname-sai\" ceremony, the Emperor would dedicate the year's harvest to kami (spirits), and taste the rice for the first time.\n\nThe modern holiday was established after World War II in 1948 as a day to mark some of the changes of the postwar Constitution of Japan, including fundamental human rights and the expansion of workers rights. Currently, \"Niiname-sai\" is still held privately by the Imperial House of Japan on the same day as Labor Thanksgiving Day, which has become a public national holiday.\n\nMay 1 is also celebrated as Labor Day by many trade unions in Japan, which hold large rallies and marches in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "75998", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=75998", "title": "Lord of Misrule", "text": "Lord of Misrule\n\nIn England, the Lord of Misrule – known in Scotland as the Abbot of Unreason and in France as the \"Prince des Sots\" – was an officer appointed by lot during Christmastide to preside over the Feast of Fools. The Lord of Misrule was generally a peasant or sub-deacon appointed to be in charge of Christmas revelries, which often included drunkenness and wild partying.\n\nThe Church held a similar festival involving a boy bishop. This custom was abolished by Henry VIII in 1541, restored by the Catholic Queen Mary I and again abolished by Protestant Elizabeth I, though here and there it lingered on for some time longer. On the Continent it was suppressed by the Council of Basle in 1431, but was revived in some places from time to time, even as late as the eighteenth century. In the Tudor period, the Lord of Misrule (sometimes called the Abbot of Misrule or the King of Misrule) is mentioned a number of times by contemporary documents referring to revels both at court and among the ordinary people.\nWhile mostly known as a British holiday custom, some folklorists, such as James Frazer and Mikhail Bakhtin (who is said to have plagiarized the novel idea from Frazer) have claimed that the appointment of a Lord of Misrule comes from a similar custom practiced during the Roman celebration of Saturnalia. In ancient Rome, from 17 to 23 December (in the Julian Calendar), a man chosen to be a mock king was appointed for the feast of Saturnalia, in the guise of the Roman deity Saturn; at the end of the festival, the man was sacrificed. This hypothesis has been heavily criticized by William Warde Fowler and as such, the Christmas custom of the Lord of Misrule during the Christian era and the Saturnalian custom of antiquity may have completely separate origins; the two separate customs, however, can be compared and contrasted.\n\nOn 1 January, AD 400, the bishop Asterius of Amasea in Pontus (Amasya, Turkey) preached a sermon against the Feast of Calends (\"this foolish and harmful delight\") that describes the role of the mock king in Late Antiquity. The New Year's feast included children arriving at each doorstep, exchanging their gifts for reward:\nThis festival teaches even the little children, artless and simple, to be greedy, and accustoms them to go from house to house and to offer novel gifts, fruits covered with silver tinsel. For these they receive, in return, gifts double their value, and thus the tender minds of the young begin to be impressed with that which is commercial and sordid.\nIt contrasted with the Christian celebration held, not by chance, on the adjoining day:\nWe celebrate the birth of Christ, since at this time God manifested himself in the flesh. We celebrate the Feast of Lights (Epiphany), since by the forgiveness of our sins we are led forth from the dark prison of our former life into a life of light and \n\nSignificantly, for Asterius the Christian feast was explicitly an entry from darkness into light, and although no conscious solar nature could have been expressed, it is certainly the renewed light at midwinter that was celebrated among Roman pagans, officially from the time of Aurelian, as the \"festival of the birth of the Unconquered Sun\". Meanwhile, throughout the city of Amasea, although entry into the temples and holy places had been forbidden by the decree of Theodosius I (391), the festival of gift-giving when \"all is noise and tumult\" in \"a rejoicing over the new year\" with a kiss and the gift of a coin, went on all around, to the intense disgust and scorn of the bishop:\nThis is misnamed a feast, being full of annoyance; since going out-of-doors is burdensome, and staying within doors is not undisturbed. For the common vagrants and the jugglers of the stage, dividing themselves into squads and hordes, hang about every house. The gates of public officials they besiege with especial persistence, actually shouting and clapping their hands until he that is beleaguered within, exhausted, throws out to them whatever money he has and even what is not his own. And these mendicants going from door to door follow one after another, and, until late in the evening, there is no relief from this nuisance. For crowd succeeds crowd, and shout, shout, and loss, \nHonest farmers coming into the city were likely to be jeered at, spanked and robbed. Worse, \n\"Even our most excellent and guileless prophets, the unmistakable representatives of God, who when unhindered in their work are our faithful ministers, are treated with insolence.\" For the soldiers, they spend all their wages in riot and loose women, see plays perhaps, \"for they learn vulgarity and the practices of actors\". \n\nTheir military discipline is relaxed and slackened. They make sport of the laws and the government of which they have been appointed guardians. For they ridicule and insult the august government. They mount a chariot as though upon a stage; they appoint pretended lictors and publicly act like buffoons. This is the nobler part of their ribaldry. But their other doings, how can one mention them? Does not the champion, the lion-hearted man, the man who when armed is the admiration of his friends and the terror of his foes, loose his tunic to his ankles, twine a girdle about his breast, use a woman's sandal, put a roll of hair on his head in feminine fashion, and ply the distaff full of wool, and with that right hand which once bore the trophy, draw out the thread, and changing the tone of his voice utter his words in the sharper feminine treble? \n\nHowever, according to the anthropologist James Frazer, there was a darker side to the Saturnalia festival. In Durostorum on the Danube (modern Silistra), Roman soldiers would choose a man from among them to be the Lord of Misrule for thirty days. At the end of that thirty days, his throat was cut on the altar of Saturn. Similar origins of the British Lord of Misrule, as a sacrificial king (a \"temporary king\", as Frazer puts it) who was later put to death for the benefit of all, have also been recorded.\n\nReferences to Frazer's view of this ancient sacrifice were made in the 1973 film \"The Wicker Man\".\n\nWhile the later Roman custom of a Lord of Misrule as a master of revels, a figure of fun and no more than that, is most familiar, there does seem to be some indication of an earlier and more unpleasant aspect to this figure. Frazer recounts:\n\nWe are justified in assuming that in an earlier and more barbarous age it was the universal practice in ancient Italy, wherever the worship of Saturn prevailed, to choose a man who played the part and enjoyed all the traditionary privileges of Saturn for a season, and then died, whether by his own or another's hand, whether by the knife or the fire or on the gallows-tree, in the character of the good god who gave his life for the world.\nIn the Tudor period, John Stow in his \"Survey of London\", published in 1603, gives a description of the Lord of Misrule:\n[I]n the feaste of Christmas, there was in the kinges house, wheresoeuer hee was lodged, a Lord of Misrule, or Maister of merry disports, and the like had yee in the house of euery noble man, of honor, or good worshippe, were he spirituall or temporall. Amongst the which the Mayor of London, and eyther of the shiriffes had their seuerall Lordes of Misrule, euer contending without quarrell or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the Beholders. These Lordes beginning their rule on Alhollon Eue [Halloween], continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, commonlie called Candlemas day: In all which space there were fine and subtle disguisinges, Maskes and Mummeries, with playing at Cardes for Counters, Nayles and pointes in euery house, more for pastimes then for gaine.\nThe Lord of Misrule is also referred to by Philip Stubbes in his \"Anatomie of Abuses\" (1585) where he states that \"the wilde heades of the parishe conventynge together, chuse them a grand Capitaine (of mischeefe) whom they ennobel with the title Lorde of Misrule\". He then gives a description of the way they dress colourfully, tie bells onto their legs and \"go to the churche (though the minister be at praier or preachyng) dauncying and swingyng their handercheefes\".\n\nWith the rise of the Puritan party in the 17th century Church of England, the custom of the Lord of Misrule was outlawed as it was deemed \"disruptive\"; even after the Restoration, the custom remained banned and soon became forgotten. In the early 19th century, the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Church ushered in \"the development of richer and more symbolic forms of worship, the building of neo-Gothic churches, and the revival and increasing centrality of the keeping of Christmas itself as a Christian festival\" as well as \"special charities for the poor\" in addition to \"special services and musical events\". Charles Dickens and other writers helped in this revival of the holiday by \"changing consciousness of Christmas and the way in which it was celebrated\" as they emphasized family, religion, gift-giving, and social reconciliation as opposed to the historic revelry common in some places.\n\n\n\n"}

The term \"Machiavellianism\" is from the book \"The Prince\" by Machiavelli which lays out advice to rulers how to govern his or her subjects. Machiavellianism has been studied extensively over the past 40 years as a personality characteristic that shares features with manipulative leadership tactics. It has in recent times been adapted and applied to the context of the workplace and organizations by many writers and academics. The Machiavellian typically manipulates on occasions where it is advantageous to achieve the required objectives.\n\nOliver James identifies Machiavellianism as one of the dark triadic personality traits in the workplace, the others being narcissism and psychopathy.\n\nA new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors:\n\nThe presence of Machiavellianism in an organisation has been positively correlated with counterproductive workplace behaviour and workplace deviance.\n\nIndividuals who are high in Machiavellianism may be more willing and more skilled at lying and less likely to give honest answers during interviews. Individuals high in Machiavellianism have stronger intentions to use deception in interviews compared to psychopaths or narcissists and are also more likely to see the use of lying in interviews as fair. Men and women high in Machiavellianism may use different tactics to influence interviewers. In one study, which examined the how much applicants allowed the interviewers to direct the topics covered during the interview, women high in Machiavellianism tended to allow interviewers more freedom to direct the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism gave interviewers the least amount of freedom in directing the content of the interview. Men high in Machiavellianism were also more likely to make up information about themselves or their experiences during job interviews.\n\nAccording to Namie, Machiavellians manipulate and exploit others to advance their perceived personal agendas and to maintain dominance over others.\n\nThe following are the guiding principles of Machiavellianism:\n\nHigh Machiavellians may be expected to do the following:\n\nIn studies there was a positive correlation between Machiavellianism and workplace bullying. Machiavellianism predicted involvement in bullying others. The groups of bullies and bully-victims had a higher Machiavellianism level compared to the groups of victims and persons non-involved in bullying. The results showed that being bullied was negatively related to the perceptions of clan and adhocracy cultures and positively related to the perceptions of hierarchy culture.\n\nIn research, Machiavellianism was positively associated with subordinate perceptions of abusive supervision (an overlapping concept with workplace bullying).\n\n\n\n"}

Diether immediately had to join the so-called anti-Palatinate alliance which had fallen into a dispute in 1458 with the Count Palatine, Frederick I. Diether forged an alliance and marched to war against the Count Palatine, but lost the decisive battle of Pfeddersheim in July 1460.\n\nBecause Diether was able to achieve his papal confirmation only with some difficulty and by paying a large amount of money (\"Servitiengeld\", 20,000 guilders), he opposed the political, legal, and financial demands of both Emperor and Pope. Pope Pius II thus sought his replacement by Adolph of Nassau who had been defeated in the 1459 election. He banished Diether on 21 August 1461 and declared him deposed, citing Diether's oppositional attitude towards the Church and Emperor Frederick III, Diether's reform efforts, and his demands for abolition of papal annates. Adolph of Nassau was appointed by the Pope as the new Archbishop of Mainz and enthroned on 1 October 1461. The city of Mainz, however, continued to support Diether, who refused to vacate the archbishop's throne.\n\nAdolph allied himself with the Archbishop of Trier, John II of Baden; the Bishop of Metz, George of Baden; the Bishop of Speyer, John II Nix of Hoheneck; and Count Ulrich V of Württemberg. Margrave Charles I of Baden at first tried to mediate between the warring factions, then took the side of his brother, Bishop George of Metz, who was in Adolph's camp, thus precipitating the Baden-Palatinate war, an attempt to seize the disputed bishopric by force.\n\nOn Diether's side were the city council of Mainz, his brother Louis, and Prince-Elector Frederick I of the Palatinate, originally an enemy of Diether's. For his assistance, Frederick was given the towns of Lorsch, Heppenheim and Bensheim.\n\nInitially the Baden troops devastated the Palatine estates left of the Rhine, then advanced alongside those from Speyer and Württemberg up the eastern side of the Rhine and rampaged through the Palatine lands there too.\n\nIn summer 1462, those on the side of the alliance under Adolph of Nassau believed rumours that Count Palatine Frederick and his troops were holding on in Bavaria in order to stand by the Duke in a feud against the Margrave of Ansbach. Under the assumption that the Palatinate was therefore undefended, Baden and Württemberg troops marched from Bretten with 8,000 men and invaded the state. They advanced, burning and plundering, from Speyer over the Rhine to Seckenheim. Because Frederick I had, however, not stayed in Bavaria, Adolph's forces were surprised and heavily defeated in the forest near Seckenheim by Frederick I and the counts of Leiningen and Katzenelnbogen, because the mounted vanguard of the alliance had felt so unthreatened that they had strayed too far ahead of their foot soldiers. Margrave Charles I and his brother, Bishop George of Metz, were wounded and taken prisoner. With the capture of Count Ulrich V of Württemberg soon afterwards by Hans von Gemmingen this phase of the war came to an end. His victory in the Battle of Seckenheim earned Frederick the nickname \"the Victorious\" (\"der Siegreiche\"). The name of the settlement of Friedrichsfeld (\"Frederick's field\"), built on the site and now a district of Mannheim, commemorates that event.\n\nFrederick I had the prisoners taken to his castle at Heidelberg and put in chains until the ransoms demanded by him were paid. Margrave Charles had to pay 25,000 guilders, hand over Sponheim as a pledge and agree Pforzheim as a fief of the Electorate of the Palatinate. The Bishop of Metz had to pay 45,000 guilders for his release. Most importantly for Frederick, though, the victory had sealed the long-term security of his position as prince-elector.\n\nBut the diocesan feud did not end there. Further battles cost many lives and resulted in the devastation of all the settlements, and the town of Mainz itself suffered severe damage. In the night of 28 October 1462, as a result of the betrayal of some of Mainz's citizens, Adolph of Nassau broke into the town through the gate called the \"Gautor\" with 500 men and, after 12 hours of street fighting took possession of the town. 400 men lost their lives and Adolph's people plundered and sacked parts of the town including the former Dominican monastery. As a punishment for its support of Diether, Adolph removed the town's privileges of freedom and thus its status as a free town; the town came under the rule of a vicedominus appointed by the Archbishop. The following day the citizens were summoned to the \"Dietmarkt\" market place. All 800 citizens who appeared were driven out of the town; about 400 of them were released again some time later and allowed to remain in Mainz.\n\nThe diocesan feud itself ended only after several attempts at mediation in October 1463. Diether of Isenburg stood down and recognised Adolph as his successor in the Treaty of Zeilsheim. He himself was paid off with a considerable sum of money and a small principality, created from the Mainz estate, consisting of the towns of Höchst, Steinheim and Dieburg.\n\nThe alliances of both contenders for the archbishop's throne had been bought at considerable cost to both their personal and the archiepiscopal estate. A number of castles and towns were transferred to the Palatinate, Hesse and, briefly, even Saxony. The settlement of that debt remained a dominant issue in the Archbishopric in the coming years.\n\nAfter the death of Adolph in 1475, Diether of Isenburg was once more elected as archbishop by the Mainz cathedral chapter and confirmed by Pope Sixtus IV. Diether reigned without further conflict until his death in 1482.\n\n\n"}

The tree is also the key element of the seal of Mercer County, New Jersey.\n\nThe Mercer Oak was named after Hugh Mercer, a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. During the Battle of Princeton, Mercer was stabbed by an English soldier's bayonet. According to legend, he was unwilling to abandon his troops, and rested on the tree's trunk while they stood their ground. After the battle, Mercer was taken to the Clarke House where he died from his injuries nine days later.\n\nAfter a lightning storm in 1973 dropped a large branch of the original \"Mercer Oak\" Ned Brown, a local artisan cabinet fabricator, from the Skillman, NJ, had the insight to preserve some of the lumber. Pieces of the preserved lumber were later integrated into the woodwork of a local restaurant. The inlay includes the craftsman's representation of a silhouette of the oak tree, as well as a sections of oak throughout the bar. The balance of the fallen branches were left in the hands of Princeton's Historical Society.\n\nOn March 3, 2000, a wind storm felled the oak's last four branches. For public safety reasons, arborists cut off the remnants of the trunk the day after the tree fell. Following the tree's death, several scions from the tree were planted around the battlefield.

Its members race a variety of single seater race cars ranging from 600cc Jedi's to 2000cc Formula Three and Formula Renault cars. \"Monoposto\" is Italian for 'Single Seater'. As of 2010, it is the largest single seater championship in the UK, with over 60 regular race entrants.\n\nProduction chassis must be 3 or more years old (unless home designed and built) and use standard road specification iron block engines.\n\nIt has several classes of cars: 1000, 1400, 1600, 1800, FR, Classic2000, 2000 and F3; these are based primarily on the maximum permitted engine size, but also engine tuning freedom, chassis age and chassis materials. Most race meetings have the classes spread over two grids, with the 1000 and 1400 cars on one, and the 2000 classes on another. The 1600 and 1800 classes are alternated between the two, either together or independently, depending on the circuit and expected entry numbers.\n\nTermed 'The Friendly Club', the Monoposto Racing Club encourages both novice and experienced drivers to take part - indeed, novice drivers are made especially welcome, and competitors are usually more than willing to lend a hand (or tools) in the paddock to make a repair or adjustment, or to simply give advice. This is summed up nicely in the club profile.\n\nThe Championship visits most major UK race tracks, including Silverstone GP, Brands Hatch GP, Snetterton, Donington ParkGP, Oulton Park, Castle Combe, Pembrey and Rockingham.\n\nIt used to have an annual non-championship event at Spa-Francorchamps but rising costs lead to this being cancelled. The club also runs the autumn Tiedeman Championship, named after the clubs founder Frank Tiedeman. Occasional non-championship rounds are also run.\n\nPoints are scored for all finishers in their class order, with 15 for 1st place down to 1 for 12th are below. There is also a point for fastest lap in each class. The championship is decided from the best 10-12 scores from 12-14 or so rounds. Events are generally run over 2 days with 4 track sessions per grid. This may be a separate qualification and race each day or a single qualification session and 3 race sessions.\n\nRecent Monoposto Champions include Jim Blockley (5 times), Jonathan Lewis (2 times), Mark Harrison (3 times, and also 2003 British Sprint Champion), Steve Cave, David Tilson, John Carding, Peter Bragg, Tristan Cliffe (3 times), Robin Dawe (3 times), Geoff Fern, Chris Woodhouse, David Parkinson, Robbie Watts, Ben Cater and Jeremy Timms.\n\nThe Monoposto Racing Club has played a large role in the introduction of modern motorbike engined single seaters to UK race circuits. Approximately ten years ago the club regulations permitted motorcycle engined cars to race as part of the 1800cc class. At that time the 1000cc & 1400cc grid contained Jedi, re-engined chassis and even one of the Gordon Murray designed, road going, Rockets.\n\nThe 1000cc & 1400cc cars rapidly outpaced the other types in the 1800cc class. This was recognised by setting up a Mono1000 & 1400 class. At the time there were few purpose designed 1000 & 1400 cars. Mono1000 & 1400 regulations recognised this by being the only Monoposto class to allow new cars to race.\nThis is primarily for bike engined cars up to 1000cc with a minimum weight limit with driver of 400 kg, or with 1400cc and a 460 kg minimum weight limit. Mostly made up of Jedis and JKS/Speads chassis.\n\nThe 1000 and 1400 classes were introduced in 2009 as replacement for the 1200S and 1200F classes.\n\nFor 2012 the 1400 class was merged with the 1000 class to create MotoMono.\n\nFor 2016, the MotoMono class was split into Moto1000 and Moto1400. Moto1400 was for any car wanting to run a carbon tub, or any spaceframed car wanting to run a bike engine in excess of 1000cc. The dominating Dallara F3 derived cars moved into this class. Moto1000 was for the traditional spaceframed Jedi/Speads type of car.\n\nIntroduced in the late 1960s the Formula Ford 1600 class has been one of the most successful classes in the history of the sport. These cars are still racing today, with thousands of chassis produced and literally years of development to produce safe, reliable racing cars with superb drivability. For several decades Formula Ford chassis have been raced in the MRC. The current Mono 1600 class has its origins in the old \"Mono Kent\" class, long the core of the club. This class used either Formula Ford engines or Formula Ford engines with a special cam. Today, Formula Fords are still the backbone of the class but while engines remain strictly controlled and therefore cheap and readily available, modifications to the chassis are permitted, such as wings, tyres from other formulae and different size wheels. Minimum weights are around 505 kg-525 kg, depending on the engine used, to equalise performance. The 1600s are the lowest powered cars in the club, but as thoroughbred single seaters they are by no means slow. There are few road cars below £60,000 that can keep up with a Mono 1600, and indeed most racing saloons struggle to equal our lap times.\n\nA good case can be made for the Mono 1800 class being the best value class in the Monoposto Championship, this equates to some of the best value racing in the U.K. With 1800cc engines and a minimum weight of 535 kg a power:weight ratio of 250 hp/tonne is common, and makes the cars surprisingly quick. Given drivers of equal ability, a Mono 1800 is several seconds a lap faster than a Mono1600. Maintenance is limited to oil, brake & tyre changes & keeping the battery charged up, the fuel injection, with its pumps consumes a significant amount of electrical energy.\n\nCars conforming to full Formula Ford Zetec 1800cc specification, with exception of tyres can run in this class or in Mono1800 against modified examples. Introduced for 2013 season. Merged with Mono1800 for 2014.\n\nFor the majority of the last ten years the Mono2000 class has been the 'blue riband' class in the MRC. The class can claim one of the premier positions in the UK club single seater scene. These cars provide slicks and wings racing with the economy and reliability of a production 2000cc, 16v engine, in a state of tune that would be familiar to those driving the majority of road going Caterhams and Westfields that use similar engines. Frequently the fastest cars in the club, this caters for cars mostly built between 1994 and 2004 with a 2000cc engine and a 560 kg weight limit. Power outputs are around 185-195 hp, giving a power:weight ratio of around 330 hp/tonne. Typically this class is dominated by Dallara F3 cars, usually with Vauxhall or Toyota engines running on carburettors as per the regulations rather than the original F3 injection and restrictor.\n\nFor 2010 the Monoposto Racing Club revised the regulations regarding fuelling, and have allowed the use of fuel injection via throttle bodies, with a maximum throttle diameter of 40mm per cylinder, through which all air must pass. This limit is intended to maintain parity with carburetted engines, so that those not able or not wanting to use injection can remain fully competitive.\n\nThere are also a number of other changes to increase the number of cars on the grid - the age limit is now 2004, and sequential gearboxes and aluminium blocks are also allowed. The Mono Formula 2000 class will also merge into Mono2000 (with cars now required to use a 25mm restrictor, rather tham 24mm in 2009), effectively allowing F3 spec cars to race in Monoposto with only minor changes to the cars. Variable valve control engines are banned, even if the mechanism is deactivated.\n\nFormula Renault 2000 cars are allowed to race, but must be in BARC specification, using the 'Blue' 37mm restrictor. This ensures the cars have balanced engine outputs.\n\nA new class for 2008 (although it was trialled in 2007), this class uses the same regulations as Mono2000 (although the 2010 changes allowing fuel injection have not passed down to the Classic class), but has an age limit to restrict it to the older cars - typically pre-1993 (although exceptions apply up to 1999 for some makes). In 2008 this was probably the largest class at any race meeting. Formula 3 cars or Formula Vauxhall Lotus chassis are the most popular and most competitive.\n\nA trial class for 2009. This class allowed Formula Renault 2000 and Formula 3 spec cars (with smaller restrictors) to race on the same grid as the other two litre cars, but without upsetting the class balance until the competitiveness of the cars is determined with the 'Mono Spec' cars (those with standard road engines). The class was integrated with Mono2000 in 2010.\n\n"}
{"id": "34550984", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=34550984", "title": "Murder of Vicki Lynne Hoskinson", "text": "Murder of Vicki Lynne Hoskinson\n\nVicki Lynne Hoskinson (February 2, 1976 - September 17, 1984) was an 8-year-old American girl who disappeared while riding her bike to mail a birthday card to her aunt on what were believed to be safe streets in Flowing Wells, Arizona. Her abductor, Frank Jarvis Atwood, was traced through witness testimony and physical evidence allegedly planted on his car. Seven months later, Vicki's remains were found in a desert area away and Atwood was found guilty of first degree murder. He has been on death row in Arizona since 1987.\n\nOn Monday, September 17, 1984, Vicki asked and received permission from her mother, Debbie Carlson, to ride her bike to a mailbox to post a birthday card to her aunt. This was the first time Carlson had allowed any of her children to go out on their own, previously using the buddy system. After 20 minutes, Carlson sent Vicki's 11-year-old sister Stephanie to look for her; Stephanie found Vicki's bike lying on the side of the road a few blocks away, and one block from the elementary school. Carlson placed Vicki's bike in her car trunk and called the Pima County Sheriff's Department. Detective Gary Dhaemers responded, and a few hours later a command center was set up.\n\nAfter interviews with possible witnesses, Sam Hall, a coach at an elementary school, stated he saw a suspicious-looking driver parked in a vehicle in an alley beside the school on September 17. Hall had been supervising a group of students at play when he noticed a suspicious vehicle. According to Hall, the driver was making strange gestures and was struggling with his stick shift. He memorized the license plate, ran to his car to get a notepad and wrote it down. He later gave it to police after hearing Vicki went missing. A little girl said the driver made an obscene gesture to her as he cruised by her house. Another saw the driver back into a telephone pole.\n\nThe trace on the license plate led to a 28-year-old Los Angeles man named Frank Jarvis Atwood. Agents ran a background check and found kidnapping and child molestation charges. Atwood was out on parole in California. They went to the address where Atwood's vehicle was registered. It was the home of Atwood's parents, Frank Jarvis Atwood Sr., a retired army brigadier general and his wife. A few hours later, Atwood called his parents stating his car had broke down in Texas and he needed money wired to get it fixed. His mother wrote down the address in Kerrville, Texas, where Atwood awaited a new transmission. His father then drove to a nearby payphone and reported the address to the FBI. Agents from the FBI's Texas Bureau detained Atwood and his traveling companion, James McDonald, at the mechanic shop on September 20 and impounded the car.\n\nDuring questioning, Atwood told investigators he was in Vicki's neighborhood on September 17, the day she disappeared, staying in a nearby park. About 3:00 PM, he left to buy drugs and returned to the park about 5:00PM, but did not say where he was during the two-hour period. McDonald corroborated Atwood's story, and told investigators that he and Atwood had an argument in the park about 3:00. After that, Atwood left for two hours and returned with bloodstains on his hands and clothing. Atwood told McDonald he got into a fight with a drug dealer and stabbed him. Investigators found two men who claimed Atwood spent two nights in their trailer. One of them, known as Mad Dog, claimed Atwood's clothes and hands were bloodstained, and that they had suggested Atwood get rid of his clothes. Atwood told them that he stabbed a double-crossing drug dealer.\n\nWhile no physical evidence in the car could be linked to Vicki's person, accident reconstruction experts matched pink paint on the front bumper of Atwood's vehicle to the color of the paint on Vicki's bike, and traced damage to the car's gravel pan to one of the bike's pedals. Traces of nickel plating from the bumper were also found on the bike. Returning to the site where the bike was found, investigators discovered damage to the mailbox post about 12 inches above ground, consistent with the height of Atwood's sports car, and believed this to be the spot where the car allegedly struck Vicki's bike at a slow speed. Atwood's alleged bloodstained clothing from the day of Vicki's disappearance was never recovered.\n\nTen days after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood was arrested and charged with one count of kidnapping. A month after Vicki's disappearance, Atwood returned to Arizona to stand trial. Because of the publicity of the case in Tucson, the trial was moved to Phoenix. Jury selection took almost 6 weeks, and bail was denied. On December 3, 1984, Atwood pleaded not guilty to kidnapping charges.\n\nOn April 12, 1985, a hiker found a small human skull in the Tucson desert, about from where the bike had been found. The skeleton had been scattered by animals. Due to the state of the remains, the cause of death could not be determined, nor whether the child had been sexually abused. Dental records confirmed they were Vicki's remains. Traces of adipocere found on the skull fixed the time that the body had been placed in the desert to within 48 hours of Vicki's disappearance. Atwood was indicted and found guilty of first degree murder, and was sentenced to death on May 8, 1987.\n\nDuring his years on death row, Atwood has \"gotten married, been baptized in the Greek Orthodox Christian church, obtained two associate degrees, a bachelor's degree in English/pre-law and a master's degree in literature. He has written six books, five of which have been published. He's also working with people on the outside to create a website\". , he was one of the longest-seated prisoners on death row. He claims that police tampered with the evidence found on his car, and that no physical evidence has been found placing Vicki in his car. His ongoing appeals for judicial re-review of his case have been denied.\n\nAfter her daughter's murder, Debbie Carlson became a victims' rights activist. She helped establish a victims' advocacy group called \"We the People\"; worked for the passage of Arizona's Victims' Bill of Rights, which was passed in 1990; and helped institute Southern Arizona's Amber Alert system in 2000.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1025070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1025070", "title": "National Ploughing Championships", "text": "National Ploughing Championships\n\nThe National Ploughing Championships () (previously known as The National Ploughing Championships Machinery & Livestock Exhibition) or (NPC) is an outdoor agricultural show in Ireland incorporating a ploughing contest. Held every September, it draws over 1,500 exhibitors and achieves attendances of over 280,000.\n\nThe first Irish inter-county ploughing contest was held between County Wexford and County Kildare on 16 February 1931 in a 26-acre field at Coursetown in Athy in County Kildare. Since then, the National Ploughing Championships has expanded to over 800 acres with 1,700 exhibitors. It has been extended beyond ploughing, farming or machinery enthusiasts, to now featuring attractions such as a tented trade village, live entertainment, music & dancing, fashion shows, craft village, live cooking demonstrations, celebrity appearances, sheep dog trials, pony games & welly throwing.\n\nIn 2014 the event attracted a record 279,500 visitors, 281,000 in 2015, 283,000 in 2016 and 291,500 in 2017.\n\nThe original mission statement for the National Ploughing Association, the body organising the championships, was set out as: \"To bring the message of good ploughing to all parts of the country and to provide a pleasant and friendly place to meet and do business\".\n\nOne of the co-founders of the Association, JJ Bergin, became its first managing director. In 1952 he represented Ireland at the first meeting of the World Ploughing Organisation (WPO) and was appointed their vice president. The first World Contest was hosted by Canada in 1953, and the second was in Killarney, County Kerry, Ireland in 1954. That was also the first European venue for the ‘Worlds’, when 10 countries competed. Also in 1954, the first ploughing competition for women was introduced, called the 'Farmerette' class, and which was open to girls and single, married or widowed women and without reference to age. The winner was known as 'Queen of the Plough'. In 1955 the National Ploughing Championships expanded into a 2-day event. The Association became a limited liability company and was incorporated on 2 March 1956, with number of directors limited to forty, with period of office of one year; its liability limited by guarantee and without shares.\n\nJJ Bergin continued to manage NPA until his passing in 1958.\n\nWhen the founding Managing Director of NPA, JJ Bergin, died in 1958, NPA appointed Kilkenny All-Ireland hurling winner Seán O'Farrell as Managing Director, a role he held until his death in 1972. A national bread baking competition was introduced by NPA in co-operation with ESB in 1958 that continues to this day. In 1959 he represented the NPA at the 7th World Ploughing Contest to Armoy, County Antrim, Northern Ireland and that was the first time they held there. He attended the 8th World Ploughing Contest in Tor Mancina, Rome, Italy 1960 where he proudly presented a distinctive block of his native Kilkenny Marble as Ireland’s contribution to Rome’s ‘Cairn of Peace’ in 1960 One of the highlights of his tenure of office was in 1961 when representing Ireland at 9th World Ploughing Contest, Thiverval-Grignon, France. He was officially introduced to President of the French Republic, Charles De Gaulle. John was a big man over 6 ft. but he proudly displayed that photo on his wall, dwarfed as he was by the 6’ 5\" tall President De Gaulle. Another big event was when the first ever Ploughing Championships were filmed by RTÉ at Killarney in 1961, believed to be the first outside coverage by the new television station. It was filmed on 8 and 9 November 1961 and broadcast in the first ever episode of the farming programme ‘On the Land’, on 1 January 1962. The film, featuring both local organiser, Mrs Grosvenor, and Seán, was remarkable in that it was broadcast the day after Teilifís Éireann first went on air. Teilifís Éireann Archives, itself founded on 1 June 1960, released in 2016 this video from 1961 of then NPA MD, Seán, and current NPA MD, Anna May, at the presentation of the NPC Farmerette trophy to Eiline Brennan from Laois being crowned Queen of the Plough, 1961.\n\nSeán continued to build on NPA’s international profile and in 1964 the NPA sent two competitors to Fuchsenbigl, near Vienna, Austria, where Ireland won their first World Title when the late Charlie Keegan, from County Wicklow was the winner. It marked a huge Irish International achievement for NPA at that time and was an inspiration to future competitors, demonstrating that the Irish had the standard and the potential to compete with the best in the world. Arriving home from the world contest in Vienna, the Wicklow man was proudly brought home to Enniskerry, County Wicklow on an open top bus to be met by bonfires along the roadside as they greeted NPA’s first World Ploughing Champion. That was a special day for Sean, as County Wicklow was his adopted county. The Irish Times reported how the tractor on which Charlie Keegan won World Ploughing Championships in 1964 had now been restored. It was a green Deutz D40L tractor that was magnificently restored to its original condition by his grandson, Michael, devoting 1,000 hours to restoration work.\n\nAt the National Championships 1964, a new Youth class was introduced for Youths 21-28. In 1965 Esso became an NPA sponsor and introduced the Esso Supreme Trophy which is still presented to the Senior Conventional Champion annually. In 1966 a new competition was introduced to cater for Students from the Agricultural Colleges. In 1969 the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA) were invited to give demonstrations in cookery and crafts. This also combined with introduction of the Country Markets as the ploughing was an ideal venue to sell produce. Seán held the position of MD until his sudden death in 1972. The Kilkenny People in their September 1972 obituary recorded that he was NPA Managing Director and a member of World Ploughing Organisation and that the graveside oration was delivered by Seán Ó Síocháin, General Secretary of GAA.\n\nThe second half of the NPA's 84-year story was led by NPA's long serving Secretary of that time from 1954, Anna May McHugh. In 1973 she was appointed NPA's managing director. Anna May, has served for 61 years as Secretary of the NPA organisation. She brought to fruition what was once a big idea of NPA founders back in 1931, what became a dream by 1958, and what had been just aspiration by 1972 - turning their collective dream into reality by 2018. And in September 2015, National Ploughing Association Managing Director Anna May McHugh was awarded the Officier de l’Ordre du Mérite Agricole by the French Ambassador to Ireland Mr Jean-Pierre Thébault. Anna May is the Irish Board Member to the Board of the World Ploughing Organisation, where her daughter, Anna Marie McHugh, is now General Secretary.\n\n1973 was also the year when 20th World Ploughing Contest was held in County Wexford in a four-day contest that was attended by 100,000 people, and when 25 countries took part. Further World Ploughing events have since been held in Ireland with 29th World Ploughing Contest in Wexford in 1981; the 43rd World Ploughing Contest at Oak Park, County Carlow in 1996 and the 53rd World Ploughing Contest at Tullow County Carlow in 2006. In 1994 Wexford man Martin Kehoe brought home the first of his three World Champion titles - in 1994 from Outram, near Dunedin, New Zealand; in 1995 from Egerton, Njoro, Kenya and in 1999 from Pomacle, France. It is noteworthy that the only other Irish World Champion (apart from first winner, Charlie Keegan) was Eamonn Tracey, winning in Saint Jean D'Illac, France in 2014. Milestones in their illustrious history were recorded in Independent Newspapers in 2011.\n\nTogether with her 32-member board of directors team, she has steered NPA into becoming one of the largest outdoor annual events in Europe.\nAmong their achievements, NPA records that in 1975 the number of national exhibitors was 100, the number of counties competing was 21 and the number of demonstrators was 18. In 1978 the Championships returned to County Kilkenny this time to the village where Anna May McHugh's predecessor, Seán O'Farrell, was born, Knocktopher. Attendance figures grew very steadily throughout the 1970s and 1980s until 1988, when the event was expanded to 3 days in order to cater for heavy traffic due to escalating attendances. According to NPA records, the ICA and Country Markets then started giving cookery and craft demonstrations at the shows. Other new events were added with the Fashion Show in 1981; their introduction of Shopping and Business Arcades in 1985 and Kverneland World Class Challenge; the Livestock Section in 1987 and the Nissan Classic in 1989. They record that the \"Tented Village\" era was developed substantially at the ploughing contests throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. They credit Enterprise Ireland with bringing delegations from a number of countries to review the event, with exhibitors travelling from Belgium, Netherlands, Germany, Poland and the USA.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2011 the Ploughing Championships had grown to 180,000 spectators, 320 competitors, 1,100 exhibitors, 14 shopping arcades and was by then generating €10m for the local Irish economy.\n\nNow in its 84th year NPA records that Event costs are in the region of €3.5 million, and have Ploughing Associations in every county in the country of Ireland. NPA claims to now hold the biggest National Ploughing Championships in the world, where over 320 competitors participate in the National Finals; to cater for 19 All-Ireland Ploughing Title Classes; are Ireland’s primary Agricultural Exhibition, and hold one of the largest agricultural events in Europe; that many international visitors, exhibitors and delegations from right around Europe and from as far afield as New Zealand now participate; that events have up to 1,100 trade stands which exhibit billions of euro worth of the most modern agri-equipment in the world on exhibition at the Championships.\n\nIt is extraordinary that NPA are still a voluntary association that depends on voluntary efforts of their members from all around the country to achieve such goals. With an average of 180,000 spectators, the NPA attendance has grown from the 3,000 that attended in 1932 to over 280,000 in the 2010s. NPA's National Ploughing Championships (NPC) are a shop window to what Irish people can achieve when working together, and a great credit to spirit of rural Ireland ever since the country gained its independence one century ago.\n\n"}

He was martyred in action during the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. He was consequently awarded the Ashoka Chakra, India's highest peace time gallantry award, on 26 January 2009.\n\nSandeep Unnikrishnan came from a Malayali family residing in Bangalore, where they had moved from Cheruvannur, Kozhikode District in the state of Kerala. He was the only son of retired ISRO officer K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi Unnikrishnan.\n\nUnnikrishnan spent 14 years at the Frank Anthony Public School in Bangalore before graduating in 1995 in the ISC Science stream. He wanted to join the Army, even attending school in a crew cut. His peers and teachers recalled him as being a good athlete who was active in school activities and sports events. He was also a member of the school choir and enjoyed watching movies.\n\nUnnikrishnan joined the National Defence Academy (India) (NDA), Pune, Maharashtra in 1995. He was a part of the Oscar Squadron (No. 4 Battalion) and a graduate of the 94th Course of NDA. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts.\nHis NDA friends remember him as \"selfless\", \"generous\" and \"calm and composed\".\n\nHe was commissioned as a lieutenant to the 7th Battalion of the Bihar Regiment (Infantry) on 12 July 1999. After serving the Indian Army in different locations in Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan during counter insurgencies for two terms, he was selected to join the National Security Guards. On completion of training, he was assigned to the Special Action Group (SAG) of NSG on January 2007 and participated in various operations of the NSG. During the 'Ghatak course' (at the Commando Wing (Infantry School), Belgaum), the most difficult course of the Army, Unnikrishnan topped the course, earning an \"Instructor Grading\" and commendation. He opted for the NSG commando service which he joined on deputation in 2006.\n\nDuring Operation Vijay in July 1999, he was regarded positively at the forward posts in the face of heavy artillery firing and small arms fire by Pakistan troops. On the evening of 31 December 1999, Unnikrishnan led a team of six soldiers and managed to establish a post 200 metres from the opposing side and under direct observation and fire.\n\nOn the night of 26 November 2008, several iconic buildings in South Mumbai were attacked. One of the buildings where hostage were held was the 100-year-old Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. Unnikrishnan was the team commander of 51 Special Action Group (51 SAG) deployed in the operation at the hotel to rescue the hostages. He entered the hotel in a group of 10 commandos and reached the sixth floor through the staircase. As the team descended the stairs, they suspected perpetrators on the third floor. A few women were held as hostages in a room which was locked from the inside. After breaking open the door, the round of fire by the perpetrators hit Commando Sunil Yadav, who was Unnikrishnan's colleague.\n\nUnnikrishan engaged the perpetrators in a firefight. He arranged for Yadav's evacuation and gave chase to those he had engaged in the firefight who, meanwhile, escaped to another floor of the hotel. In the encounter that followed, he was shot from the back before later succumbing to his injuries.\n\nHis last words were, \"Do not come up, I will handle them,\" according to NSG officials.\n\nThe official citation for the Ashoka Chakra Award reads:\n\nAt Unnikrishnan's funeral, mourners chanted \"Sandeep Unnikrishnan Amar Rahe\" (Long live Sandeep Unnikrishnan). Thousands of people lined up outside his Bangalore house to pay their respects. His funeral was held with full military honours.\n\nThe Mother Dairy Double Road in Bangalore, a 4.5 km road from Federal Mogul on Doddaballapur Road to MS Palya junction, was renamed Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan Road in his honour. \nA bust of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan is installed on Ramamurthy Nagar Outer Ring Road junction in Bengaluru and is named in his honour.\n\n\n"}

How much of the tale is true is unclear.\n\nSarah Wilson was born in Staffordshire and at the age of 16 moved to London. According to the usual tale, within a week she became a maidservant to Caroline Vernon, lady-in-waiting for Queen Charlotte, and was acquainted with the relations and rumours of the court.\n\nAround 1771 Wilson was working in the \"Queen's House\" (in the place where Buckingham Palace is now). She began to steal the jewellery and clothing of the queen. She was apprehended and first condemned to death but eventually the sentence was commuted to penal transportation to the American colonies. In July 1771, Wilson arrived to Baltimore, Maryland and was sold to W. Devall as an indentured servant. A few days later she escaped.\n\nAccording to the tale, Wilson still had some of the queen's belongings with her. With the queen's dress, she took the role of \"Princess Susanna Caroline Matilda of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\", fictitious sister of Queen Charlotte. She claimed that she had had a disagreement with her family and due to the scandal had moved to America. She fooled a number of Virginian landowners with her courtly habits and knowledge of royal affairs. When some local colonials accepted her as genuine, others began to question why no one had ever heard of the queen's sister. The Queen was originally from Germany and this princess spoke only English.\n\nEventually Devall heard about a woman who looked very much like the girl who had escaped. In 1771 he spread a notice that 'Princess Susanna' was his slave and sent her hireling Michael Dalton to get her back. Dalton found her near Charlestown, Virginia and dragged her back to Bush Creek.\n\nFor two years Wilson worked for Devall, until he joined the rebels at the beginning of the American War of Independence. Wilson fled and later married dragoon officer William Talbot. After the war they stayed in the newly formed United States of America.\n\nThere is no record of when Sarah Wilson died. Author Egon Larsen suggested that she died in Bristol in 1865.\n\n\n"}

The current theatre is located in the 2nd arrondissement at 4 rue Monsigny with an entrance at the back at 65 Passage Choiseul. In the 19th century the theatre was often referred to as the Salle Choiseul. With the decline in popularity of operetta after 1870, the theatre expanded its repertory to include comedies.\n\nIn February 1855 Offenbach successfully requested a license from the Parisian authorities for the performance of what he described as a \"new and original\" genre of musical theatre. He justified his proposed endeavour by saying that these works would have mass appeal and would provide opportunities for young French composers.\n\nThe company gave its first performances during the summer of 1855 at the Salle Lacaze. This theatre was unusually small with a capacity of only 300 spectators, but was located on the Carré Marigny, near the crowds attending the Exposition Universelle. The inaugural performance was on 5 July with Offenbach conducting four of his own works: a prologue called \"Entrez, messieurs, mesdames\", a one-act \"pièce d'occasion\" written by Joseph Méry and \"Jules Servières\" (a nom de plume of Ludovic Halévy, who worked as a government official and needed to protect his reputation); \"Une nuit blanche\", a one-act \"opéra-comique\" on a pastoral theme; \"Arlequin barbier\", a pantomime utilizing themes from Rossini's \"Il barbiere di Siviglia\" arranged by \"Alfred Lange\" (Offenbach); and \"Les deux aveugles\", a one-act \"bouffonerie musicale\" about two swindling \"blind\" Parisian beggars. The latter was almost cut, since the invited audience who attended the dress rehearsal failed to laugh, but Offenbach decided to retain it, and it was the hit of the opening night. This little piece soon acquired an international reputation (due to visitors from the Exposition), and Offenbach's admirers soon included Tolstoy and Thackeray. Further performances in the summer of 1855 were primarily of satirical sketches which only included a few musical numbers. The season, however, was so successful that Offenbach was able to resign his position as conductor of the Théâtre Français.\n\nIn October Offenbach submitted another petition to the authorities, this time to merge his company with the Théâtre des Jeunes Élèves de Monsieur Comte (Théâtre Comte). This company's theatre, which was not much larger than the Salle Lacaze, was demolished, and the larger Salle Choiseul with a capacity of about 900 was constructed. The new theatre was not only larger, but warmer, more luxurious and more comfortable than the Salle Lacaze. The orchestra was enlarged from sixteen players to thirty. Offenbach's new license permitted performances of one-act comedies, with or without music, but with fewer than five characters. It also specifically excluded sketches and required the performance of at least two works by composers other than Offenbach. The first performance of the merged company was on 29 December 1855 at the Salle Choiseul and included the premiere of Offenbach's \"Ba-ta-clan\", a one-act \"chinoiserie musicale\" with a libretto by Halévy. From this time performances were primarily given at the Salle Choiseul during the winter theatre season. The company performed at the Salle Lacaze during the 1856, 1857 and 1859 summer seasons, however, in March 1861 legislation was enacted which prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued. In spite of the restrictions of the license, Offenbach began including longer, more substantial works which violated its terms. For instance, his two-act \"Orphée aux enfers\" with a cast of 16 received its first performance at the Salle Choiseul on 21 October 1858. Even after Offenbach resigned as the director in January 1862, the company continued at the Salle Choiseul, performing light operas by other composers as well as Offenbach.\n\nUpon the departure of Offenbach, the new director tore down the existing hall to erect a larger one with a capacity of 1100 spectators.\n\nWhile the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens is indelibly linked to Offenbach, it has also been the venue for a number of other important works. In addition to Offenbach's own operettas, the theatre has seen the premieres of musical works by Hervé, Emmanuel Chabrier and Claude Terrasse and playwrights such as Robert de Flers, Albert Willemetz, Sacha Guitry and Henri Bernstein.\n\nFrom 1986 to 2007, the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens was under the directorship of Jean-Claude Brialy, who died of cancer in May 2007.\n\nThe Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens was founded as a private entrepreneurship.\n\n\n"}

He joined the Royal Air Force during the Second World War. After his Mustang was shot down he was taken prisoner and held in the German prisoner of war camp Stalag Luft III at Sagan where he actively participated in the Great Escape, being one of the 76 officers to break out and make some distance across enemy occupied territory before being recaptured. His name was not one of the 50 who were picked to be executed and he, with 25 others, went back into captivity. He retired from the RAF in 1955 and worked in financial services in Canada. He died in Canada in 2004.\n\nBethell’s parents lived abroad serving with the British Colonial Services in East Africa and Gibraltar. Bethell was born on 9 April 1922 in Dar-es-Salaam, then part of the British territory of Tanganyika. He and his brother were boarders at Junior Kings School, Sturry, Kent and regularly sailed to Gibraltar to see their parents during school holidays. The Bethell family lived for some years in Gibraltar where his father was state treasurer, and only returned to England after his death. Bethell’s education was completed at Sherborne School, where he attained the position of head boy.\n\nJoining the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman 2nd class (service number 1314695) in February 1941, he completed pilot training in the USA in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. From there he was posted to a training unit at Hawarden before joining No. 268 (Fighter) Squadron as a sergeant-pilot. He was commissioned as a pilot officer on 7 February 1942 with the RAF officer’s service number 120413 and was promoted to flying officer on 1 October 1942.\n\nEquipped with the North American P-51 Mustang, 268 Squadron flew \"rhubarbs\" (low level sweeps) to attack enemy shipping off the Dutch coast and ground targets such as troop transports and military railway freight. On 26 November 1942, during a mission over the Netherlands he shot down a Messerschmitt Bf 109 near Elburg and minutes later a Junkers Ju 52 transport aircraft near Oldebroek. These were stated in his obituary to be the squadron's first successes and the first of hundreds to fall to Mustangs during the war.\nOn 7 December 1942 Bethell was a member of a flight flying a low-level ground attack mission in the Alkmaar area of the Netherlands when his Mustang “V for Victor” (serial number \"AP212\") was hit by light anti-aircraft fire while only 20 feet off the ground. He crash landed and tried to evade German infantrymen searching for him by hiding in a dyke but was captured. Following interrogation at Dulag Luft he was sent to prison camp Stalag Luft III at Sagan. During his time in captivity he was promoted flight lieutenant on 7 February 1944.\n\nBethell participated in \"the Great Escape\" from Stalag Luft III, he was actively involved in tunneling and hauling away the soil, to build the tunnel in which two hundred men were to slip through a tunnel code named \"Harry\", which ran below the ground and outwards. Due to a calculation error, it surfaced just short of the tree-line which was supposed to give cover to the escapers. The 77th escaper was spotted by a guard around 5am and the alarm sounded. Bethell’s position during the escape was initially at \"Leicester Square\", the second staging point along the tunnel's length. His role was to pull 20 men through until relieved by escaper number 65 and then escape himself and take cover in the woods to await the next nine men before making good his escape.\n\nAfter pulling out 12 men, Bethell had to sit in his cramped underground space for 45 minutes until the next man arrived and explained that someone had got stuck and had to be pulled back and the tunnel repaired. Shortly after Bethell's group had cleared the tunnel into the woods there was a shot signalling that the escape had been discovered. They broke into twos and Bethell joined Les Long known to all as \"Cookie\", hoping to cross the Czech border about 40 miles distant. Snow and flooding forced them to alter their route toward Frankfurt an der Oder where they hoped to hop on a freight train and escape to Sweden. They walked along a railway line, slept in a barn at night then started to travel in daylight but were captured at Bernau. Long and Bethell were held in the \"Gestapo\" prison at Görlitz until Long was taken away and shot. Bethell was returned to the prison camp.\n\nAs the Russian Red Army approached Sagan in January 1945, Bethell was amongst the column of prisoners of war marched towards Lübeck, arriving shortly before the end of the war.\n\nOn release from wartime service he joined the trading company Gellatly Hankey in Africa working in the Khartoum and Addis Ababa area until boredom led him to rejoin the general duties branch of the Royal Air Force as a flight lieutenant on 7 December 1949. He became a navigator instructor and also served as personal assistant to Air Chief Marshal Sir George Pirie. In 1953 he was posted to No. 145 Squadron at Celle in Germany flying the de Havilland Vampire, before becoming a flight commander on No. 16 Squadron, also operating Vampires from Celle close to the East German border. Bethell finally retired from the RAF in June 1955, after which he emigrated to Canada.\n\nHe was initially employed in the brokerage business in Montreal, he worked for Elican, a Belgian company and later joined the financial services industry. On retiring in the early 1990s he and his wife Lorna moved to a farm at Caledon, Ontario, north of Toronto, where he spent much time on a John Deere tractor cutting fallow hayfields.\n\nTony Bethell died in Canada on 17 February 2004.\n\n"}

{"id": "30275656", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30275656", "title": "Wars of the Roses", "text": "Wars of the Roses\n\nThe Wars of the Roses were a series of English civil wars for control of the throne of England fought between supporters of two rival branches of the royal House of Plantagenet: the House of Lancaster, associated with a red rose, and the House of York, whose symbol was a white rose. Eventually, the wars eliminated the male lines of both families. The conflict lasted through many sporadic episodes between 1455 and 1487, but there was related fighting before and after this period between the parties. The power struggle ignited around social and financial troubles following the Hundred Years' War, unfolding the structural problems of feudalism, combined with the mental infirmity and weak rule of King Henry VI which revived interest in Richard of York's claim to the throne. Historians disagree on which of these factors to identify as the main reason for the wars.\n\nWith the Duke of York's death, the claim transferred to his heir, Edward, who later became the first Yorkist king of England, as Edward IV. He reigned from 1461, interrupted by a Lancastrian uprising and reinstallment of Henry VI in 1470 to 1471, until his sudden death in 1483. His son reigned for 78 days as Edward V, but was then deposed by his uncle, who became Richard III.\n\nThe final victory went to a relative and claimant of the Lancastrian party, Henry Tudor, son of Henry VI's half-brother Edmund Earl of Richmond, who defeated Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field. After assuming the throne as Henry VII, he married Elizabeth of York, the eldest daughter and heir of Edward IV, thereby uniting the two claims. The House of Tudor ruled the Kingdom of England until 1603, with the death of Elizabeth I, granddaughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York.\n\nThe name \"Wars of the Roses\" refers to the heraldic badges associated with two rival branches of the same royal house, the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. \"Wars of the Roses\" came into common use in the 19th century after the publication in 1829 of \"Anne of Geierstein\" by Sir Walter Scott. Scott based the name on a scene in William Shakespeare's play \"Henry VI, Part 1\" (Act 2, Scene 4), set in the gardens of the Temple Church, where a number of noblemen and a lawyer pick red or white roses to show their loyalty to the Lancastrian or Yorkist faction respectively. It is often suggested by literary critics that Lewis Carroll's \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" has strong allegorical references to the conflict with York represented by the White Queen and Lancaster represented by the Red Queen.\n\nThe Yorkist faction used the symbol of the white rose from early in the conflict, but the Lancastrian red rose was apparently introduced only after the victory of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth, when it was combined with the Yorkist white rose to form the Tudor rose, which symbolised the union of the two houses; the origins of the Rose as a cognizance itself stem from Edward I's use of \"a golden rose stalked proper.\" Often, owing to nobles holding multiple titles, more than one badge was used: Edward IV, for example, used both his sun in splendour as Earl of March, but also his father's falcon and fetterlock as Duke of York. Badges were not always distinct; at the Battle of Barnet, Edward's 'sun' was very similar to the Earl of Oxford's Vere star, which caused fateful confusion.\n\nMost, but not all, of the participants in the wars wore livery badges associated with their immediate lords or patrons under the prevailing system of bastard feudalism; the wearing of livery was by now confined to those in \"continuous employ of a lord\", thus excluding, for example, mercenaries. Another example: Henry Tudor's forces at Bosworth fought under the banner of a red dragon while the Yorkist army used Richard III's personal device of a white boar.\n\nAlthough the names of the rival houses derive from the cities of York and Lancaster, the corresponding duchy and dukedom had little to do with these cities. The lands and offices attached to the Duchy of Lancaster were mainly in Gloucestershire, North Wales, Cheshire, and (ironically) in Yorkshire, while the estates and castles of the Duke of York were spread throughout England and Wales, many in the Welsh Marches.\n\nTensions within England during the 1450s centered on the mental state of Henry VI and on his inability to produce an heir with his wife, Margaret of Anjou. In the absence of a direct heir, there were two rival branches with claims to the throne should Henry die without issue, being the Beaufort family, led by Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and the House of York, headed by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. By 1453, issues had come to a head: though Margaret of Anjou was pregnant, Henry VI was descending into increasing mental instability, by August becoming completely non-responsive and unable to govern. A Great Council of nobles was called, and through shrewd political machinations, Richard had himself declared Lord Protector and chief regent during the mental incapacity of Henry. In the interlude, Margaret gave birth to a healthy son and heir, Edward.\n\nBy 1455, Henry had regained his faculties, and open warfare came at the First Battle of St Albans. Several prominent Lancastrians died at the hands of the Yorkists. Henry was again imprisoned, and Richard of York resumed his role as Lord Protector. Although peace was temporarily restored, the Lancastrians were inspired by Margaret of Anjou to contest York's influence, and a deadly feud between the two branches of the royal family ensued.\n\nFighting resumed more violently in 1459. York and his supporters were forced to flee the country, and Henry once again restored to direct rule, but one of York's most prominent supporters, the Earl of Warwick, invaded England from Calais in October 1460 and captured Henry VI yet again at the Battle of Northampton. York returned to the country and for the third time became Protector of England, but was dissuaded from claiming the throne, though it was agreed that he would become heir to the throne (thus displacing Henry and Margaret's son, Edward of Westminster, from the line of succession). Margaret and the remaining Lancastrian nobles gathered their army in the north of England.\n\nWhen York moved north to engage them, he and his second son Edmund were killed at the Battle of Wakefield in December 1460. The Lancastrian army advanced south and released Henry at the Second Battle of St Albans, but failed to occupy London, and subsequently retreated to the north. York's eldest son, Edward, Earl of March, was proclaimed King Edward IV. He gathered the Yorkist armies and won a crushing victory at the Battle of Towton in March 1461.\n\nAfter Lancastrian revolts in the north were suppressed in 1464, Henry was captured once again and placed in the Tower of London. Edward fell out with his chief supporter and adviser, the Earl of Warwick (known as the \"Kingmaker\") after Edward's unpopular and secretly conducted marriage with the widow of a Lancastrian supporter, Elizabeth Woodville. Within a few years, it became clear that Edward was favouring his wife's family and alienating a number of friends closely aligned with Warwick as well.\n\nFurious, Warwick tried first to supplant Edward with his younger brother George, Duke of Clarence, establishing the alliance by marriage to his daughter, Isabel Neville. When that plan failed, due to lack of support from Parliament, Warwick sailed to France with his family and made an alliance with the former Lancastrian Queen, Margaret of Anjou, to restore Henry VI to the throne.\n\nThis resulted in two years of rapid changes of fortune, before Edward IV once again won complete victories at Barnet (14 April 1471), where Warwick was killed, and Tewkesbury (4 May 1471) where the Lancastrian heir, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales was killed, or perhaps executed after the battle. Queen Margaret was escorted to London as a prisoner and Henry was murdered in the Tower of London several days later, ending the direct Lancastrian line of succession.\n\nA period of comparative peace followed, ending with the unexpected death of King Edward in 1483. His surviving brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, first moved to prevent the unpopular Woodville family of Edward's widow from participating in the government during the minority of Edward's son, Edward V, and then seized the throne for himself, using the suspect legitimacy of Edward IV's marriage as pretext.\n\nHenry Tudor, a distant relative of the Lancastrian kings who had inherited their claim, defeated Richard III at Bosworth in 1485. He was crowned Henry VII, and married Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV, to unite and reconcile the two houses. Yorkist revolts, directed by John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln and others, flared up in 1487 under the banner of the pretender Lambert Simnel—who claimed he was Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of George of Clarence), resulting in the last pitched battles.\n\nThough most surviving descendants of Richard of York were imprisoned, sporadic rebellions continued until 1497, when Perkin Warbeck, who claimed he was the younger brother of Edward V, one of the two disappeared Princes in the Tower, was imprisoned and later executed.\n\nWilliam the Conqueror's son King Henry I of England died in 1135, after his only male heir was killed aboard the White Ship. Following the White Ship disaster, England entered a period of prolonged instability known as The Anarchy. However, following the ascension of Henry of Anjou to the throne in 1154 as Henry II, the crown passed from father to son or brother to brother with little difficulty until 1399.\n\nThe question of succession after Edward III's death in 1377 is said to be the cause of the Wars of Roses. He had five surviving legitimate sons: Edward, the Black Prince (1330–1376); Lionel, Duke of Clarence (called 'Lionel of Antwerp' 1338–1368); John, Duke of Lancaster (called 'John of Gaunt'; 1340–1399); Edmund, Duke of York (called 'Edmund of Langley' 1341–1402); and Thomas, Earl of Buckingham (1355–1397). Although Edward III's succession seemed secure, there was a \"sudden narrowing in the direct line of descent\" near the end of his reign. His eldest son, Edward, the Black Prince, had died the year before. Edward III was succeeded on the throne by the Black Prince's only surviving son Richard II, who was only 10 years old. Richard's claim to the throne was based on the principle that the son of an elder brother had priority in the succession over his uncles. Since Richard was a minor, had no siblings, and had three living uncles at the time of Edward III's death, there was considerable uncertainty about who was next in line for the succession after Richard.\n\nIf Richard II died without legitimate offspring, his successors by primogeniture would be the descendants of Lionel of Antwerp, Edward III's second son. Clarence's only daughter, Philippa, 5th Countess of Ulster, married into the Mortimer family and had a son, Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March (1374–1398), who technically had the best claim to succeed. However, a legal decree issued by Edward III in 1376 introduced some complexity into the question of who would ultimately take the throne. The letters patent he issued limited the right of succession to male heirs, which placed his third son John of Gaunt ahead of Clarence's descendants, because the Mortimer line of descent passed through a daughter.\n\nRichard II's reign was marked by increasing dissension between the King and several of the most powerful nobles. In 1399, he exiled Gaunt's son Henry of Bolingbroke. Richard's government had become highly unpopular beyond his strongholds in Cheshire and Wales. Throughout his reign, Richard had repeatedly switched his choice of heir in order to keep his political enemies at bay and perhaps to reduce the chances of deposition. Nevertheless, when Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, initially to reclaim his rights as Duke of Lancaster, he took advantage of the support of most of the nobles to depose Richard and was crowned King Henry IV, establishing the House of Lancaster on the throne.\n\nThe House of Lancaster descended from John of Gaunt, third surviving son of Edward III of England. Their name derives from John of Gaunt's primary title of Duke of Lancaster, which he held by right of his spouse, Blanche of Lancaster. They had received explicit preference from Edward III in the line of succession because they formed the most senior unbroken male line of descent from him.\n\nHenry IV's claim to the throne was through his father, John of Gaunt. At the onset of Richard II's reign, Gaunt was the official heir presumptive, but due to the intrigues of his turbulent rule, the succession was unclear by the time of his deposition. Therefore, an argument could be made that the legitimate king of England was not Henry IV, but instead was Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, the son of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March. However, there was little support at the time for his counter-claim. Certainly many people believed it to be the case. As Henry's initial popularity waned, the Mortimer family's claim to the throne was a pretext for the major rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr in Wales, and other, less successful, revolts in Cheshire and Northumberland. There were uprisings in support of the Mortimers' claim throughout Henry IV's reign, which lasted until 1413.\n\nA peculiarity of Henry IV's seizure of the throne is demonstrated in the way he announced his claim. He was vague, and he resigned himself to mentioning that he was the rightful heir of Henry III, who had died more than a century before, perhaps subtly implying that all English kings ever since (Edward I, Edward II, Edward III and Richard II) had not been rightful monarchs. Henry IV seems to have been exploiting a legend that Henry III's second son Edmund \"Crouchback\", 1st Earl of Lancaster, was in fact his eldest son but had been removed from succession because he had a physical deformity, which gave origin to his nickname. Since Henry IV was Edmund's descendant and heir through his mother Blanche of Lancaster, he was in fact the rightful king. There is no evidence for this legend, and Edmund's nickname did not stem from a deformity.\n\nAn important branch of the House of Lancaster was the House of Beaufort, whose members were descended from Gaunt by his mistress, Katherine Swynford. Originally illegitimate, they were made legitimate by an Act of Parliament when Gaunt and Katherine later married. However, Henry IV excluded them from the line of succession to the throne.\n\nHenry IV's son and successor, Henry V, inherited a temporarily pacified nation, and his military success against France in the Hundred Years' War bolstered his popularity, enabling him to strengthen the Lancastrian hold on the throne. Nevertheless, one notable conspiracy against Henry, the Southampton Plot, took place during his nine-year reign. This was led by Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who attempted to place Edmund Mortimer, his brother-in-law, in the throne. Cambridge was executed for treason in 1415, at the start of the campaign that led to the Battle of Agincourt.\n\nThe founder of the House of York was Edmund of Langley, the fourth son of Edward III and the younger brother of John of Gaunt. Their family name comes from Edmund's title Duke of York, which he acquired in 1385. However, the superiority of their claim is not based on the male line, but on the female line, as descendants of Edward III's second son Lionel of Antwerp. Edmund's second son, Richard, Earl of Cambridge, who was executed by Henry V, had married Anne de Mortimer, daughter of Roger Mortimer and sister of Edmund Mortimer. Anne's grandmother, Philippa of Clarence, was the daughter of Lionel of Antwerp. The Mortimers were the most powerful marcher family of the fourteenth century. G.M. Trevelyan has written that \"the Wars of the Roses were to a large extent a quarrel between Welsh Marcher Lords, who were also great English nobles, closely related to the English throne.\"\nAnne de Mortimer had died in 1411. When her brother Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March, who had loyally supported Henry, died childless in 1425, the title and extensive estates of the Earldom of March and the Mortimer claim to the throne thus passed to Anne's descendants.\n\nRichard of York, the son of Cambridge and Anne Mortimer, was four years old at the time of his father's execution. Although Cambridge was attainted, Henry V later allowed Richard to inherit the title and lands of Cambridge's elder brother Edward, Duke of York, who had died fighting alongside Henry at Agincourt and had no issue. Henry, who had three younger brothers and was himself in his prime and recently married to the French princess, Catherine of Valois, had no doubt that the Lancastrian right to the crown was secure.\n\nHenry's premature death in 1422, at the age of 36, led to his only son Henry VI coming to the throne as an infant and the country being ruled by a divided Council of regency. Henry V's younger brothers produced no surviving legitimate issue, leaving only distant cousins (the Beauforts) as alternative Lancaster heirs. As Richard of York grew into maturity and questions were raised over Henry VI's fitness to rule, Richard's claim to the throne thus became more significant. The revenue from the York and March estates also made him the wealthiest magnate in the land.\n\nFrom early childhood, Henry VI was surrounded by quarrelsome councillors and advisors. His younger surviving paternal uncle, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, sought to be named Lord Protector and deliberately courted the popularity of the common people for his own ends but was opposed by his half-uncle Cardinal Henry Beaufort. On several occasions, Beaufort called on John, Duke of Bedford, Humphrey's older brother, to return from his post as Henry VI's regent in France, either to mediate or to defend him against Humphrey's accusations of treason. Henry VI's coming of age in 1437 brought no end to the noblemen's scheming, as his weak personality made him prone to being swayed and influenced by select courtiers, especially those whom he deemed his favourites. Some time after, Cardinal Beaufort withdrew from public affairs, partly due to old age and partly because William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk, rose to become the dominant personality at court. Suffolk and the Beauforts were widely held to be enriching themselves through their influence on Henry, and were blamed for mismanaging the government and poorly executing the continuing Hundred Years' War with France. Under Henry VI, all the land in France won by Henry V and even the provinces of Guienne and Gascony, which had been held since the reign of Henry II three centuries previously, were lost.\n\nOpposition to Suffolk and Beaufort was led by Humphrey of Gloucester, and Richard of York]]. Humphrey felt that the lifetime efforts of his brothers, of himself, and of many Englishmen in the war against France were being wasted as the French territories slipped from English hands, especially since Suffolk and his supporters were trying to make large diplomatic and territorial concessions to the French in a desperate attempt for peace. In this, Gloucester enjoyed little influence, as Henry VI tended to favour Suffolk and Beaufort's faction at court due to its less hawkish and more conciliatory inclinations. The Duke of York, Bedford's successor in France, and at times also described as a skeptic of the peace policy, became entangled in this dispute as Suffolk and the Beauforts were frequently granted large money and land grants from the king, as well as important government and military positions, redirecting much needed resources away from York's campaigns in France.\nSuffolk eventually succeeded in having Humphrey of Gloucester arrested for treason. Humphrey died while awaiting trial in prison at Bury St Edmunds in 1447. Some authorities date the start of the War of the Roses from the death of Humphrey. At the same time, Richard of York was stripped of the prestigious military command in France and sent to govern the relatively distant Ireland, whereby he could not interfere in the proceedings of the court. However, with severe reverses in France, Suffolk was stripped of office and was murdered on his way to exile. Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset (Cardinal Beaufort's nephew), succeeded him as leader of the party seeking peace with France. The Duke of York meanwhile represented those who wished to prosecute the war more vigorously, and criticised the court, and Somerset in particular, for starving him of funds and men during his campaigns in France.\n\nIn all these quarrels, Henry VI had taken little part. He was seen as a weak, ineffectual king. In addition, he displayed several symptoms of mental illness that he may have inherited from his maternal grandfather, Charles VI of France. By 1450 many considered Henry incapable of carrying out the duties and responsibilities of a king.\n\nIn 1450, there was a violent popular revolt in Kent, Jack Cade's Rebellion, which is often seen as the prelude to the Wars of the Roses. The rebel manifesto, \"The Complaint of the Poor Commons of Kent\" written under Cade's leadership, accused the crown of extortion, perversion of justice, and election fraud. The rebels occupied parts of London, and executed James Fiennes, 1st Baron Saye and Sele, the unpopular Lord High Treasurer, after a hasty trial. After some of them fell to looting, they were driven out of London by the citizens. They dispersed after they were supposedly pardoned but several, including Cade, were later executed. After the rebellion the rebels' grievances formed the basis of Richard of York's opposition to a royal government from which he felt excluded.\n\nTwo years later, in 1452, Richard of York returned to England from his new post as Lieutenant of Ireland and marched on London, demanding Somerset's removal and reform of the government. At this stage, few of the nobles supported such drastic action, and York was forced to submit to superior force at Blackheath. He was imprisoned for much of 1452 and 1453 but was released after swearing not to take arms against the court.\n\nThe increasing discord at court was mirrored in the country as a whole, where noble families engaged in private feuds and showed increasing disrespect for the royal authority and for the courts of law. In many cases feuds were fought between old-established families, and formerly minor nobility raised in power and influence by Henry IV in the aftermath of the rebellions against him. The quarrel between the Percys—long the Earls of Northumberland—and the comparatively upstart Nevilles was the best-known of these private wars and followed this pattern, as did the Bonville–Courtenay feud in Cornwall and Devon. A factor in these feuds was the presence of large numbers of soldiers discharged from the English armies that had been defeated in France. Nobles engaged many of these to mount raids, or to pack courts of justice with their supporters, intimidating suitors, witnesses and judges.\n\nThis growing civil discontent, the abundance of feuding nobles with private armies, and corruption in Henry VI's court formed a political climate ripe for civil war. With the king so easily manipulated, power rested with those closest to him at court, in other words, Somerset and the Lancastrian faction. Richard and the Yorkist faction, who tended to be physically placed further away from the seat of power, found their power slowly being stripped away. Royal power and finances also started to slip, as Henry was persuaded to grant many royal lands and estates to the Lancastrians, thereby losing their revenue.\n\nIn 1453, Henry suffered the first of several bouts of complete mental collapse, during which he failed even to recognise his new-born son, Edward of Westminster. On 22 March 1454, Cardinal John Kemp, the Chancellor, died. Henry was incapable of nominating a successor. To ensure that the country could be governed, a Council of Regency was set up, headed by the Duke of York, who still remained popular with the people, as Lord Protector. York soon asserted his power with ever-greater boldness (although there is no proof that he had aspirations to the throne at this early stage). He imprisoned Somerset and backed his Neville allies (his brother-in-law, the Earl of Salisbury, and Salisbury's son, the Earl of Warwick), in their continuing feud with the Earl of Northumberland, a powerful supporter of Henry.\n\nHenry recovered in 1455 and once again fell under the influence of those closest to him at court. Directed by Henry's queen, the powerful and aggressive Margaret of Anjou, who emerged as the \"de facto\" leader of the Lancastrians, Richard was forced out of court. Margaret built up an alliance against Richard and conspired with other nobles to reduce his influence. An increasingly thwarted Richard (who feared arrest for treason) finally resorted to armed hostilities in 1455.\n\nRichard, Duke of York, led a small force toward London and was met by Henry's forces at St Albans, north of London, on 22 May 1455. The relatively small First Battle of St Albans was the first open conflict of the civil war. Richard's aim was ostensibly to remove \"poor advisors\" from King Henry's side. The result was a Lancastrian defeat. Several prominent Lancastrian leaders, including Somerset and Northumberland, were killed. After the battle, the Yorkists found Henry hiding in a local tanner's shop, abandoned by his advisers and servants, apparently having suffered another bout of mental illness. (He had also been slightly wounded in the neck by an arrow.) York and his allies regained their position of influence. With the king indisposed, York was again appointed Protector, and Margaret was shunted aside, charged with the king's care.\n\nFor a while, both sides seemed shocked that an actual battle had been fought and did their best to reconcile their differences, but the problems that caused conflict soon re-emerged, particularly the issue of whether the Duke of York, or Henry and Margaret's infant son, Edward, would succeed to the throne. Margaret refused to accept any solution that would disinherit her son, and it became clear that she would only tolerate the situation for as long as the Duke of York and his allies retained the military ascendancy.\n\nHenry recovered and in February 1456 he relieved York of his office of Protector. In the autumn of that year, Henry went on royal progress in the Midlands, where the king and queen were popular. Margaret did not allow him to return to London where the merchants were angry at the decline in trade and the widespread disorder. The king's court was set up at Coventry. By then, the new Duke of Somerset was emerging as a favourite of the royal court. Margaret persuaded Henry to revoke the appointments York had made as Protector, while York was made to return to his post as lieutenant in Ireland.\n\nDisorder in the capital and the north of England (where fighting between the Nevilles and Percys had resumed ) and piracy by French fleets on the south coast were growing, but the king and queen remained intent on protecting their own positions, with the queen introducing conscription for the first time in England. Meanwhile, York's ally, Warwick (later dubbed \"The Kingmaker\"), was growing in popularity in London as the champion of the merchants; as Captain of Calais he had fought piracy in the Channel.\n\nIn the spring of 1458, Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, attempted to arrange a reconciliation. The lords had gathered in London for a Grand Council and the city was full of armed retainers. The Archbishop negotiated complex settlements to resolve the blood-feuds that had persisted since the Battle of St. Albans. Then, on Lady Day (25 March), the King led a \"love day\" procession to St. Paul's Cathedral, with Lancastrian and Yorkist nobles following him, hand in hand. No sooner had the procession and the Council dispersed than plotting resumed.\n\nThe next outbreak of fighting was prompted by Warwick's high-handed actions as Captain of Calais. He led his ships in attacks on neutral Hanseatic League and Spanish ships in the Channel on flimsy grounds of sovereignty. He was summoned to London to face enquiries, but he claimed that attempts had been made on his life, and returned to Calais. York, Salisbury and Warwick were summoned to a royal council at Coventry, but they refused, fearing arrest when they were isolated from their own supporters.\n\nYork summoned the Nevilles to join him at his stronghold at Ludlow Castle in the Welsh Marches. On 23 September 1459, at the Battle of Blore Heath in Staffordshire, a Lancastrian army failed to prevent Salisbury from marching from Middleham Castle in Yorkshire to Ludlow. Shortly afterwards the combined Yorkist armies confronted the much larger Lancastrian force at the Battle of Ludford Bridge. Warwick's contingent from the garrison of Calais under Andrew Trollope defected to the Lancastrians, and the Yorkist leaders fled. York returned to Ireland, and his eldest son, Edward, Earl of March, Salisbury and Warwick fled to Calais.\n\nThe Lancastrians were back in total control. York and his supporters were attainted at the Parliament of Devils as traitors. Somerset was appointed Governor of Calais and was dispatched to take over the vital fortress on the French coast, but his attempts to evict Warwick were easily repulsed. Warwick and his supporters even began to launch raids on the English coast from Calais, adding to the sense of chaos and disorder. Being attainted, only by a successful invasion could the Yorkists recover their lands and titles. Warwick travelled to Ireland to concert plans with York, evading the royal ships commanded by the Duke of Exeter.\nIn late June 1460, Warwick, Salisbury and Edward of March crossed the Channel and rapidly established themselves in Kent and London, where they enjoyed wide support. Backed by a papal emissary who had taken their side, they marched north. King Henry led an army south to meet them while Margaret remained in the north with Prince Edward. At the Battle of Northampton on 10 July, the Yorkist army under Warwick defeated the Lancastrians, aided by treachery in the king's ranks. For the second time in the war, King Henry was found by the Yorkists in a tent, abandoned by his retinue, having apparently suffered another breakdown. With the king in their possession, the Yorkists returned to London.\n\nIn the light of this military success, Richard of York moved to press his claim to the throne based on the illegitimacy of the Lancastrian line. Landing in north Wales, he and his wife Cecily entered London with all the ceremony usually reserved for a monarch. Parliament was assembled, and when York entered he made straight for the throne, which he may have been expecting the Lords to encourage him to take for himself as they had acclaimed Henry IV in 1399. Instead, there was stunned silence. York announced his claim to the throne, but the Lords, even Warwick and Salisbury, were shocked by his presumption; they had no desire at this stage to overthrow King Henry. Their ambition was still limited to the removal of his councillors.\n\nThe next day, York produced detailed genealogies to support his claim based on his descent from Lionel of Antwerp, Duke of Clarence. York's claim was through a daughter of a second son, Henry's through the son of a third son. The judges felt that Common law principles could not determine who had priority in the royal succession, and declared the matter \"above the law and passed ther lernyng.\" Parliament agreed to consider the matter and accepted that York's claim was better, but by a majority of five, they voted that Henry VI should remain as king. A compromise was struck in October 1460 with the Act of Accord, which recognised York as Henry's successor, disinheriting Henry's six-year-old son, Edward. York accepted this compromise as the best offer. It gave him much of what he wanted, particularly since he was also made Protector of the Realm and was able to govern in Henry's name.\n\nQueen Margaret and her son had fled to north Wales, parts of which were still in Lancastrian hands. They later travelled by sea to Scotland to negotiate for Scottish assistance. Mary of Gueldres, Queen Consort to James II of Scotland, agreed to give Margaret an army on condition that she cede the town of Berwick to Scotland and Mary's daughter be betrothed to Prince Edward. Margaret agreed, although she had no funds to pay her army and could only promise booty from the riches of southern England, as long as no looting took place north of the River Trent.\n\nThe Duke of York left London later that year with the Earl of Salisbury to consolidate his position in the north against the Lancastrians who were reported to be massing near the city of York. He took up a defensive position at Sandal Castle near Wakefield over Christmas 1460. Then on 30 December, his forces left the castle and attacked the Lancastrians in the open, although outnumbered. The ensuing Battle of Wakefield was a complete Lancastrian victory. Richard of York was slain in the battle, and both Salisbury and York's 17-year-old second son, Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were captured and executed. Margaret ordered the heads of all three placed on the gates of York.\n\nThe Act of Accord and the events of Wakefield left the 18-year-old Edward, Earl of March, York's eldest son, as Duke of York and heir to his claim to the throne. With an army from the pro-Yorkist Marches (the border area between England and Wales), he met Jasper Tudor's Lancastrian army arriving from Wales, and he defeated them soundly at the Battle of Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire. He inspired his men with a \"vision\" of three suns at dawn (a phenomenon known as \"parhelion\"), telling them that it was a portent of victory and represented the three surviving York sons; himself, George and Richard. This led to Edward's later adoption of the sign of the sunne in splendour as his personal device.\n\nMargaret's army was moving south, supporting itself by looting as it passed through the prosperous south of England. In London, Warwick used this as propaganda to reinforce Yorkist support throughout the south – the town of Coventry switched allegiance to the Yorkists. Warwick's army established fortified positions north of the town of St Albans to block the main road from the north but was outmanoeuvred by Margaret's army, which swerved to the west and then attacked Warwick's positions from behind. At the Second Battle of St Albans, the Lancastrians won another big victory. As the Yorkist forces fled they left behind King Henry, who was found unharmed, sitting quietly beneath a tree.\n\nHenry knighted thirty Lancastrian soldiers immediately after the battle. In an illustration of the increasing bitterness of the war, Queen Margaret instructed her seven-year-old son Edward of Westminster to determine the manner of execution of the Yorkist knights who had been charged with keeping Henry safe and had stayed at his side throughout the battle.\n\nAs the Lancastrian army advanced southwards, a wave of dread swept London, where rumours were rife about savage northerners intent on plundering the city. The people of London shut the city gates and refused to supply food to the queen's army, which was looting the surrounding counties of Hertfordshire and Middlesex.\n\nEdward of March, having joined with Warwick's surviving forces, advanced towards London from the west at the same time that the queen retreated northwards to Dunstable; as a result, Edward and Warwick were able to enter London with their army. They found considerable support there, as the city was largely Yorkist-supporting. It was clear that Edward was no longer simply trying to free the king from bad councillors, but that his goal was to take the crown. Thomas Kempe, the Bishop of London, asked the people of London their opinion and they replied with shouts of \"King Edward\". The request was quickly approved by Parliament, and Edward was unofficially appointed king in an impromptu ceremony at Westminster Abbey; Edward vowed that he would not have a formal coronation until Henry VI and his wife were removed from the scene. Edward claimed Henry had forfeited his right to the crown by allowing his queen to take up arms against his rightful heirs under the Act of Accord. Parliament had already accepted that Edward's victory was simply a restoration of the rightful heir to the throne.\n\nEdward and Warwick marched north, gathering a large army as they went, and met an equally impressive Lancastrian army at Towton. The Battle of Towton, near York, was the biggest battle of the Wars of the Roses. Both sides agreed beforehand that the issue would be settled that day, with no quarter asked or given. An estimated 40,000–80,000 men took part, with over 20,000 men being killed during (and after) the battle, an enormous number for the time and the greatest recorded single day's loss of life on English soil. Edward and his army won a decisive victory, and the Lancastrians were routed, with most of their leaders slain. Henry and Margaret, who were waiting in York with their son Edward, fled north when they heard the outcome. Many of the surviving Lancastrian nobles switched allegiance to King Edward, and those who did not were driven back to the northern border areas and a few castles in Wales. Edward advanced to take York, where he replaced the rotting heads of his father, his brother, and Salisbury with those of defeated Lancastrian lords such as the notorious John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford of Skipton-Craven, who was blamed for the execution of Edward's brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, after the Battle of Wakefield.\n\nThe official coronation of Edward IV took place in June 1461 in London, where he received a rapturous welcome from his supporters.\n\nAfter the Battle of Towton, Henry VI and Margaret had fled to Scotland, where they stayed with the court of James III and followed through on their promise to cede Berwick to Scotland. Later in the year, they mounted an attack on Carlisle, but, lacking money, they were easily repulsed by Edward's men, who were rooting out the remaining Lancastrian forces in the northern counties. Several castles under Lancastrian commanders held out for years: Dunstanburgh, Alnwick (the Percy family seat), and Bamburgh were some of the last to fall.\n\nThere was also some fighting in Ireland. At the Battle of Piltown in 1462, the Yorkish supporter Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Desmond, defeated the Lancastrian Butlers of Kilkenny. The Butlers suffered more than 400 casualties. Local folklore claims that the battle was so violent that the local river ran red with blood, hence the names Pill River and Piltown (\"Baile an Phuill\", meaning \"Town of the blood\").\n\nThere were Lancastrian revolts in the north of England in 1464. Several Lancastrian nobles, including the third Duke of Somerset, who had apparently been reconciled to Edward, readily led the rebellion. The revolt was put down by Warwick's brother, John Neville. A small Lancastrian army was destroyed at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April, but because Neville was escorting Scottish commissioners for a treaty to York, he could not immediately follow up this victory. Then on 15 May, he routed Somerset's army at the Battle of Hexham. Somerset was captured and executed.\n\nThe deposed King Henry was later captured for the third time at Clitheroe in Lancashire in 1465. He was taken to London and held prisoner at the Tower of London, where, for the time being, he was reasonably well treated. About the same time, once England under Edward IV and Scotland had come to terms, Margaret and her son were forced to leave Scotland and sail to France, where they maintained an impoverished court in exile for several years. The last remaining Lancastrian stronghold was Harlech Castle in Wales, which surrendered in 1468 after a seven-year-long siege.\n\nThe powerful Earl of Warwick (\"the Kingmaker\") had meanwhile become the greatest landowner in England. Already a great magnate through his wife's property, he had also inherited his father's estates and had been granted much forfeited Lancastrian property. He also held many of the offices of state. He was convinced of the need for an alliance with France and had been negotiating a match between Edward and a French bride. However, Edward had married Elizabeth Woodville, the widow of a Lancastrian knight, in secret in 1464. He later announced the news of his marriage as \"fait accompli\", to Warwick's considerable embarrassment.\n\nThis embarrassment turned to bitterness when the Woodvilles came to be favoured over the Nevilles at court. Many of Queen Elizabeth's relatives were married into noble families and others were granted peerages or royal offices. Other factors compounded Warwick's disillusionment: Edward's preference for an alliance with Burgundy rather than France and reluctance to allow his brothers George, Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to marry Warwick's daughters Isabel and Anne. Furthermore, Edward's general popularity was on the wane in this period with higher taxes and persistent disruptions of law and order.\nBy 1469, Warwick had formed an alliance with Edward's jealous and treacherous brother George, who married Isabel Neville in defiance of Edward's wishes in Calais. They raised an army that defeated the king's forces at the Battle of Edgecote Moor. Edward was captured at Olney, Buckinghamshire, and imprisoned at Middleham Castle in Yorkshire. (Warwick briefly had \"two\" Kings of England in his custody.) Warwick had the queen's father, Richard Woodville, 1st Earl Rivers, and her brother John executed. However, he made no immediate move to have Edward declared illegitimate and place George on the throne. The country was in turmoil, with nobles once again settling scores with private armies (in episodes such as the Battle of Nibley Green), and Lancastrians being encouraged to rebel. Few of the nobles were prepared to support Warwick's seizure of power. Edward was escorted to London by Warwick's brother George Neville, the Archbishop of York, where he and Warwick were reconciled, to outward appearances.\n\nWhen further rebellions broke out in Lincolnshire, Edward easily suppressed them at the Battle of Losecoat Field. From the testimony of the captured leaders, he declared that Warwick and George, Duke of Clarence, had instigated them. They were declared traitors and forced to flee to France, where Margaret of Anjou was already in exile. Louis XI of France, who wished to forestall a hostile alliance between Edward and Edward's brother-in-law Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, suggested the idea of an alliance between Warwick and Margaret. Neither of those two formerly mortal enemies entertained the notion at first, but eventually they were brought round to realise the potential benefits. However, both were undoubtedly hoping for different outcomes: Warwick for a puppet king in the form of Henry VI or his young son; Margaret to be able to reclaim her family's realm. In any case, a marriage was arranged between Warwick's daughter Anne and Margaret's son Edward of Westminster, and Warwick invaded England in the autumn of 1470.\n\nEdward IV had already marched north to suppress another uprising in Yorkshire. Warwick, with help from a fleet under his nephew, the Bastard of Fauconberg, landed at Dartmouth and rapidly secured support from the southern counties and ports. He occupied London in October and paraded Henry VI through the streets as the restored king. Warwick's brother John Neville, who had recently received the empty title Marquess of Montagu and who led large armies in the Scottish marches, suddenly defected to Warwick. Edward was unprepared for this event and had to order his army to scatter. He and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, fled from Doncaster to the coast and thence to Holland and exile in Burgundy. They were proclaimed traitors, and many exiled Lancastrians returned to reclaim their estates.\n\nWarwick's success was short-lived, however. He over-reached himself with his plan to invade Burgundy in alliance with the King of France, tempted by King Louis' promise of territory in the Netherlands as a reward. This led Edward's brother-in-law, Charles of Burgundy, to provide funds and troops to Edward to enable him to launch an invasion of England in 1471. Edward landed with a small force at Ravenspur on the Yorkshire coast. Initially claiming to support Henry and to be seeking only to have his title of Duke of York restored, he soon gained the city of York and rallied several supporters. His brother George turned traitor again, abandoning Warwick. Having outmaneuvered Warwick and Montagu, Edward captured London. His army then met Warwick's at the Battle of Barnet. The battle was fought in thick fog, and some of Warwick's men attacked each other by mistake. It was believed by all that they had been betrayed, and Warwick's army fled. Warwick was cut down trying to reach his horse. Montagu was also killed in the battle.\n\nMargaret and her son Edward had landed in the West Country only a few days before the Battle of Barnet. Rather than return to France, Margaret sought to join the Lancastrian supporters in Wales and marched to cross the Severn but was thwarted when the city of Gloucester refused her passage across the river. Her army, commanded by the fourth successive Duke of Somerset, was brought to battle and destroyed at the Battle of Tewkesbury. Her son Prince Edward, the Lancastrian heir to the throne, was killed. With no heirs to succeed him, Henry VI was murdered shortly afterwards, on 21 May 1471, to strengthen the Yorkist hold on the throne.\n\nThe restoration of Edward IV in 1471 is sometimes seen as marking the end of the Wars of the Roses proper. Peace was restored for the remainder of Edward's reign. His youngest brother, Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and Edward's lifelong companion and supporter, William Hastings, were generously rewarded for their loyalty, becoming effectively governors of the north and midlands respectively. George of Clarence became increasingly estranged from Edward, and was executed in 1478 for association with convicted traitors.\n\nWhen Edward died suddenly in 1483, political and dynastic turmoil erupted again. Many of the nobles still resented the influence of the queen's Woodville relatives (her brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers and her son by her first marriage, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset), and regarded them as power-hungry upstarts ('\"parvenus\"'). At the time of Edward's premature death, his heir, Edward V, was only 12 years old and had been brought up under the stewardship of Earl Rivers at Ludlow Castle.\n\nOn his deathbed, Edward had named his surviving brother Richard of Gloucester as Protector of England. Richard had been in the north when Edward died. Hastings, who also held the office of Lord Chamberlain, sent word to him to bring a strong force to London to counter any force the Woodvilles might muster. The Duke of Buckingham also declared his support for Richard.\n\nRichard and Buckingham overtook Earl Rivers, who was escorting the young Edward V to London, at Stony Stratford in Buckinghamshire on 28 April. Although they dined with Rivers amicably, they took him prisoner the next day, and declared to Edward that they had done so to forestall a conspiracy by the Woodvilles against his life. Rivers and his nephew Richard Grey were sent to Pontefract Castle in Yorkshire and executed there at the end of June.\n\nEdward entered London in the custody of Richard on 4 May, and was lodged in the Tower of London. Elizabeth Woodville had already gone hastily into sanctuary at Westminster with her remaining children, although preparations were being made for Edward V to be crowned on 22 June, at which point Richard's authority as Protector would end. On 13 June, Richard held a full meeting of the Council, at which he accused Hastings and others of conspiracy against him. Hastings was executed without trial later in the day.\n\nThomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, then persuaded Elizabeth Woodville to allow her younger son, the 9-year-old Richard, Duke of York, to join Edward in the Tower. Having secured the boys, Robert Stillington, Bishop of Bath and Wells then alleged that Edward IV's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville had been illegal and that the two boys were therefore illegitimate. Richard then claimed the crown as King Richard III. The two imprisoned boys, known as the \"Princes in the Tower\", disappeared and are assumed to have been murdered. There was never a trial or judicial inquest on the matter. Perkin Warbeck claimed he was the younger of the Princes from 1490 and was recognised as such by Richard's sister, the Duchess of Burgundy.\n\nHaving been crowned in a lavish ceremony on 6 July, Richard then proceeded on a tour of the Midlands and the north of England, dispensing generous bounties and charters and naming his own son as the Prince of Wales.\n\nOpposition to Richard's rule had already begun in the south when, on 18 October, the Duke of Buckingham (who had been instrumental in placing Richard on the throne and who himself had a distant claim to the crown) led a revolt aimed at installing the Lancastrian Henry Tudor. It has been argued that his supporting Tudor rather than either Edward V or his younger brother, showed Buckingham was aware that both were already dead.\n\nThe Lancastrian claim to the throne had descended to Henry Tudor on the death of Henry VI and his son in 1471. Henry's father, Edmund Tudor, 1st Earl of Richmond, had been a half-brother of Henry VI, but Henry's claim to royalty was through his mother, Margaret Beaufort. She was descended from John Beaufort, who was a son of John of Gaunt and thus a grandson of Edward III. John Beaufort had been illegitimate at birth, though later legitimised by the marriage of his parents. It had supposedly been a condition of the legitimation that the Beaufort descendants forfeited their rights to the crown. Henry had spent much of his childhood under siege in Harlech Castle or in exile in Brittany. After 1471, Edward IV had preferred to belittle Henry's pretensions to the crown, and made only sporadic attempts to secure him. However his mother, Margaret Beaufort, had been twice remarried, first to Buckingham's uncle, and then to Thomas, Lord Stanley, one of Edward's principal officers, and continually promoted her son's rights.\n\nBuckingham's rebellion failed. Some of his supporters in the south rose up prematurely, thus allowing Richard's Lieutenant in the South, the Duke of Norfolk, to prevent many rebels from joining forces. Buckingham himself raised a force at Brecon in mid-Wales. He was prevented from crossing the River Severn to join other rebels in the south of England by storms and floods, which also prevented Henry Tudor landing in the West Country. Buckingham's starving forces deserted and he was betrayed and executed.\n\nThe failure of Buckingham's revolt was clearly not the end of the plots against Richard, who could never again feel secure, and who also suffered the loss of his wife and eleven-year-old son, putting the future of the Yorkist dynasty in doubt.\n\nMany of Buckingham's defeated supporters and other disaffected nobles fled to join Henry Tudor in exile. Richard made an attempt to bribe the Duke of Brittany's chief Minister Pierre Landais to betray Henry, but Henry was warned and escaped to France, where he was again given sanctuary and aid.\n\nConfident that many magnates and even many of Richard's officers would join him, Henry set sail from Harfleur on 1 August 1485, with a force of exiles and French mercenaries. With fair winds, he landed in Pembrokeshire six days later and the officers Richard had appointed in Wales either joined Henry or stood aside. Henry gathered supporters on his march through Wales and the Welsh Marches and defeated Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard was slain during the battle, supposedly by the major Welsh landowner Rhys ap Thomas with a blow to the head from his poleaxe. Rhys was knighted three days later by Henry VII.\n\nHenry, having been acclaimed King Henry VII, strengthened his position by marrying Elizabeth of York, daughter of Edward IV and the best surviving Yorkist claimant, reuniting the two royal houses. Henry merged the rival symbols of the red rose of Lancaster and the white rose of York into the new emblem of the red and white Tudor Rose. Henry later shored up his position by executing a number of other claimants, a policy his son Henry VIII continued.\n\nMany historians consider the accession of Henry VII to mark the end of the Wars of the Roses. Others argue that they continued to the end of the fifteenth century, as there were several plots to overthrow Henry and restore Yorkist claimants. Only two years after the Battle of Bosworth, Yorkists rebelled, led by John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, who had been named by Richard III as his heir but had been reconciled with Henry after Bosworth. The conspirators produced a pretender, a boy named Lambert Simnel, who resembled the young Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of George of Clarence), the best surviving male claimant of the House of York. The imposture was shaky, because the young earl was still alive and in King Henry's custody and was paraded through London to expose the impersonation. At the Battle of Stoke Field, Henry defeated Lincoln's army. Lincoln died in the battle. Simnel was pardoned for his part in the rebellion and was sent to work in the royal kitchens.\n\nHenry's throne was challenged again in 1491, with the appearance of the pretender Perkin Warbeck, who claimed he was Richard, Duke of York (the younger of the two Princes in the Tower). Warbeck made several attempts to incite revolts, with support at various times from the court of Burgundy and James IV of Scotland. He was captured after the failed Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 and killed in 1499, after attempting to escape from prison. Warwick was also executed, rendering the male-line of the House of York (and by extension the whole Plantagenet dynasty) extinct.\n\nDuring the reign of Henry VII's son Henry VIII, the possibility of a Yorkist challenge to the throne remained until as late as 1525, in the persons of Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham, Edmund de la Pole, 3rd Duke of Suffolk and his brother Richard de la Pole, all of whom had blood ties to the Yorkist dynasty but were excluded by the pro-Woodville Tudor settlement. To an extent, England's break with Rome was prompted by Henry's fears of a disputed succession, should he leave only a female heir to the throne or an infant who would be as vulnerable as Henry VI had been to antagonistic or rapacious regents.\n\nHistorians debate the extent of impact the wars had on medieval English life. The classical view is that the many casualties among the nobility continued the changes in feudal English society caused by the effects of the Black Death. These included a weakening of the feudal power of the nobles and an increase in the power of the merchant classes, and the growth of a centralised monarchy under the Tudors. The wars heralded the end of the medieval period in England and the movement towards the Renaissance. After the wars the large standing baronial armies that had helped fuel the conflict were suppressed. Henry VII, wary of any further fighting, kept the barons on a very tight leash, removing their right to raise, arm and supply armies of retainers so that they could not make war on each other or the king. The military power of individual barons declined, and the Tudor court became a place where baronial squabbles were decided with the influence of the monarch.\n\nRevisionists, such as the Oxford historian K. B. McFarlane, suggest that the effects of the conflicts have been greatly exaggerated and that there were no wars of the roses. Many places were unaffected by the wars, particularly in the eastern part of England, such as East Anglia. It has also been suggested that the traumatic impact of the wars was exaggerated by Henry VII, to magnify his achievement in quelling them and bringing peace. The effect of the wars on the merchant and labouring classes was far less than in the long drawn-out wars of siege and pillage in Europe, which were carried out by mercenaries who profited from long wars. Although there were some lengthy sieges, such as those of Harlech Castle and Bamburgh Castle, these were in comparatively remote and less populous regions. In the populated areas, both factions had much to lose by the ruin of the country and sought quick resolution of the conflict by pitched battle. Philippe de Commines observed in 1470:\n\nThe realm of England enjoys one favour above all other realms, that neither the countryside nor the people are destroyed, nor are buildings burnt or demolished. Misfortune falls on soldiers and nobles in particular...\n\nExceptions to this claimed general rule were the Lancastrian looting of Ludlow after the largely bloodless Yorkist defeat at Ludford Bridge in 1459, and the widespread pillaging carried out by Queen Margaret's unpaid army as it advanced south in early 1461. Both events inspired widespread opposition to the Queen, and support for the Yorkists.\n\nMany areas did little or nothing to change their city defences, perhaps an indication that they were left untouched by the wars. City walls were either left in their ruinous state or only partially rebuilt. In the case of London, the city was able to avoid being devastated by convincing the York and Lancaster armies to stay out after the inability to recreate the defensive city walls.\n\nFew noble houses were extinguished during the wars; in the period from 1425 to 1449, before the outbreak of the wars, there were as many extinctions of noble lines from natural causes (25) as occurred during the fighting (24) from 1450 to 1474. The most ambitious nobles died and by the later period of the wars, fewer nobles were prepared to risk their lives and titles in an uncertain struggle.\n\nThe kings of France and Scotland and the dukes of Burgundy played the two factions off against each other, pledging military and financial aid and offering asylum to defeated nobles and pretenders, to prevent a strong and unified England from making war on them.\n\nChronicles written during the Wars of the Roses include:\n\n\n\"The above-listed individuals with well-defined sides are coloured with red borders for Lancastrians and blue for Yorkists (The Kingmaker, his relatives and George Plantagenet changed sides, so they are represented with a purple border)\"\n\nSources:\n\nThe hinge point in the succession dispute is the forced abdication of Richard II and whether it was lawful or not. Following that event, Richard's legitimate successor would be Henry Bolingbroke if strict Salic inheritance were adhered to, or Anne Mortimer if male-preference primogeniture, which eventually became the standard form of succession (until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013), were adhered to.\n\nFollowing defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a contributory cause of the Wars of the Roses. The wars were fought largely by the landed aristocracy and armies of feudal retainers, with some mercenaries.\n\nAt the end of the Hundred Years' War large numbers of unemployed soldiery returned to England seeking employment in the growing armies of local nobility. England drifted toward misrule and violence under the weak governance as local noble families like the Nevilles and Percies increasingly relied on their feudal retainers to settle disputes. It became common practice for landowners to bind their \"mesnie\" knights to their service with annual payments.\n\nEdward III had developed the contract system where the monarch entered into formal written contracts called indenture with experienced captains who were contractually obliged to provide an agreed upon number of men, at established rates for a given period. Frequently the landed nobility acted the principal or main contractor. Knights, men at arms and archers were often sub-contracted. A lord could find men amongst his tenantry who included landless men and others who would crave the security of maintenance and livery. Skilled archers could command as high a wage as knights. As baronial armies grew in size, the rule of law was weakened.\n\nSupport for each house largely depended upon dynastic factors, such as blood relationships, marriages within the nobility and the grants or confiscations of feudal titles and lands. Given the conflicting loyalties of blood, marriage and ambition, it was not uncommon for nobles to switch sides; several battles (such as Northampton and Bosworth) were decided by treachery.. The armies consisted of nobles' contingents of men-at-arms, with companies of archers and foot-soldiers (such as billmen). There were sometimes contingents of foreign mercenaries, armed with cannon or handguns. The horsemen were generally restricted to \"prickers\" and \"scourers\"; i.e. scouting and foraging parties.\n\nMuch like their campaigns in France, it was customary for the English gentry to fight entirely on foot. In several cases, noblemen dismounted and fought amongst the common foot-soldiers to both inspire them and due to the fact that, as proven by the experiences of battles on the continent, heavy cavalry is of limited tactical value when both sides possess large numbers of skilled Longbowmen.\n\nIt was often claimed that the nobles faced greater risks than the ordinary soldiers as there was little incentive for anyone to take prisoner any high-ranking noble during or immediately after a battle. During the Hundred Years' War against France, a captured noble would be able to ransom himself for a large sum but in the Wars of the Roses, a captured noble who belonged to a defeated faction had a high chance of being executed as a traitor. Forty-two captured knights were executed after the Battle of Towton. The Burgundian observer Philippe de Commines, who met Edward IV in 1470, reported,\n\nKing Edward told me in all the battles which he had won, as soon as he had gained victory, he mounted his horse and shouted to his men that they must spare the common soldiers and kill the lords, of whom none or few escaped.\n\nEven those who escaped execution might be declared \"attainted\" therefore possess no property and be of no value to a captor.\n\n\n\n"}

Laurence\n\nWilliam Leonard Laurence (March 7, 1888 – March 19, 1977) was a Jewish Lithuanian-born American journalist known for his science journalism writing of the 1940s and 1950s while working for \"The New York Times\". He won two Pulitzer Prizes and, as the official historian of the Manhattan Project, was the only journalist to witness the Trinity test and the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. He is credited with coining the iconic term \"Atomic Age\" which became popular in the 1950s.\n\nLaurence was born Leib Wolf Siew in Salantai, a small city in the Russian Empire that is now in Lithuania. He emigrated to the United States in 1905, after participating in the Russian Revolution of 1905, and he soon changed his name, taking \"William\" after William Shakespeare, \"Leonard\" after Leonardo da Vinci, and \"Lawrence\" after a street he lived on in Roxbury, Massachusetts (but spelled with a \"u\" in reference to Friedrich Schiller's Laura). He attended Harvard University (1908–1911; 1914–1915), the University of Besançon (1919) and Harvard Law School (1921) before receiving his LL.B. from the Boston University School of Law in 1925. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1913. During World War I, he served with the U.S. Army Signal Corps.\n\nIn 1926 he began his career as a journalist, working for \"The World\" of New York City. In 1930 he began working at \"The New York Times\", specializing where possible in reporting on scientific issues. He married Florence Davidow in 1931.\n\nIn 1934, Laurence co-founded the National Association of Science Writers, and in 1936 he covered the Harvard Tercenary Conference of Arts and Sciences, work for which he and four other science reporters received the 1937 Pulitzer Prize for Reporting.\n\nOn May 5, 1940, Laurence published a front-page exclusive in the \"New York Times\" on successful attempts in isolating uranium-235 which were reported in \"Physical Review\", and outlined many (somewhat hyperbolic) claims about the possible future of nuclear power. He had assembled it in part out of his own fear that Nazi Germany was attempting to develop atomic energy, and had hoped the article would galvanize a U.S. effort. Though his article had no effect on the U.S. bomb program, it was passed to the Soviet mineralogist Vladimir Vernadsky by his son, a professor of history at Yale University, and motivated Vernadsky to urge Soviet authorities to embark on their own atomic program, and established one of the first commissions to formulate \"a plan of measures which it would be necessary to realize in connection with the possibility of using intraatomic energy\". A Soviet atomic bomb project got started c. 1942; a full-scale Soviet atomic energy program began after the war.\n\nOn September 7, 1940, \"The Saturday Evening Post\" ran an article by Laurence on atomic fission, \"The Atom Gives Up\". In 1943, government officials asked librarians nationwide to withdraw the issue.\n\nIn April 1945, Laurence was summoned to the secret Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico by General Leslie Groves to serve as the official historian of the Manhattan Project. In this capacity he was also the author of many of the first official press releases about nuclear weapons, including some delivered by the Department of War and President Harry S. Truman. He was the only journalist present at the Trinity test in July 1945, and beforehand prepared statements to be delivered in case the test ended in a disaster which killed those involved. As part of his work related to the Project, he also interviewed the airmen who flew on the mission to drop the atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima, Japan. Laurence himself flew aboard the B-29 \"The Great Artiste\", which served as a blast instrumentation aircraft, for the atomic bombing of Nagasaki. He visited the test Able site at Bikini Atoll aboard the press ship \"Appalachian\", for the bomb test on July 1, 1946.\n\nFor his 1945 coverage of the atomic bomb, beginning with the eyewitness account from Nagasaki, he won a second Pulitzer Prize for Reporting in 1946. At the office of the \"Times\" he was thereafter referred to as \"Atomic Bill\", to differentiate him from William H. Lawrence, a political reporter at the newspaper.\n\nIn his autobiography, Richard Feynman mentioned William Laurence standing next to him during the Trinity test. Feynman stated, \"I had been the one who was supposed to have taken him around. Then it was found that it was too technical for him, and so later H.D. Smyth came and I showed him around.\" Nuclear historian Alex Wellerstein has called Laurence \"part huckster, part journalist, all wild card ... improbable in every way, a real-life character with more strangeness than would seem tolerable in pure fiction.\" \n\nIn 1946, he published an account of the Trinity test as \"Dawn Over Zero\", which went through at least two revisions. He continued to work at the \"Times\" through the 1940s and into the 1950s, and published a book on defense against nuclear war in 1950. In 1951, his book \"The Hell Bomb\" warned about the use of a cobalt bomb – a form of hydrogen bomb (still an untested device at the time he wrote it) engineered to produce a maximum amount of nuclear fallout.\n\nIn 1956, he was present at the testing of a hydrogen bomb at the Pacific Proving Grounds. That same year, he also became appointed Science Editor of the \"New York Times\", succeeding Waldemar Kaempffert. He served in this capacity until he retired in 1964.\n\nDuring his later career, he received honorary doctorates from Boston University (Sc.D., 1946), the Stevens Institute of Technology (Sc.D., 1951), Grinnell College (D.H.L., 1951) and Yeshiva University (D.H.L., 1957).\n\nLaurence died in 1977 in Majorca, Spain, of complications from a blood clot in his brain.\n\nIn 2004, journalists Amy Goodman and David Goodman called for the Pulitzer Board to strip Laurence and his paper, \"The New York Times\", of his 1946 Pulitzer Prize. The journalists argued that at the time Laurence \"was also on the payroll of War Department\" and that, after the atomic bombings, he \"had a front-page story in the \"Times\"\" disputing the notion that radiation sickness was killing people.\" They concluded that \"his faithful parroting of the government line was crucial in launching a half-century of silence about the deadly lingering effects of the bomb\".\n\nIn their 1995 book \"Hiroshima in America: Fifty Years of Denial\", Robert Jay Lifton and Greg Mitchell assert, \"Here was the nation's leading science reporter, severely compromised, not only unable but disinclined to reveal all he knew about the potential hazards of the most important scientific discovery of his time.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}

First organized in 1900, these events became firmly established after the Second World War. Each World Congress is sponsored by one of the member societies in a different country, which assumes responsibility for the organization of that Congress. The purpose of these events is to contribute to the development of professional relations between philosophers of all countries, promote philosophical education, and contribute to the impact of philosophical knowledge on global problems. The 24th World Congress of Philosophy was held in Beijing in August 2018.\n\nThe first International Congress of Philosophy was held in Paris in 1900 on the occasion of the Universal Exhibition. Among the participants were Henri Bergson, Maurice Blondel, Moritz Cantor, Louis Couturat, Henri Poincaré, and Bertrand Russell. The second International Congress took place in Geneva in 1904; the third was held in Heidelberg in 1908 (with Josiah Royce, Wilhelm Windelband and Benedetto Croce). The First World War interrupted the sequence of these events after the 4th International Congress in Bologna in 1911.\n\nThereafter these congresses were held in Naples (1924), Cambridge, USA (1926), Oxford, UK (1930), Prague (1934), and Paris (1937). The next International Congress of Philosophy was held in 1948, and these events have been held every five years under FISP sponsorship ever since. Recent congresses have taken place in Brighton (1988), Moscow (1993), Boston (1988), Istanbul (2003), Seoul (2008), and Athens (2013). The event became known as the World Congress of Philosophy in 1973.\n\nThousands of philosophers from dozens of countries participated in the week-long event in Boston sponsored by the International Federation of Philosophical Societies. An edited selection of the papers presented were published as \"The Proceedings of the Twentieth World Congress of Philosophy\" in twelve thematically organized volumes by the Philosophy Documentation Center, in cooperation with the Congress's American Organizing Committee. All papers are available online at the Paideia Archives. The topics of the volumes include: \n\nThese Proceedings were edited by Jaakko Hintikka, Robert Cummings Neville, Ernest Sosa, and Alan M.

{"id": "5043597", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5043597", "title": "Zacarias Moussaoui", "text": "Zacarias Moussaoui\n\nZacarias Moussaoui (Arabic: زكريا موسوي, \"\"; born May 30, 1968) is a French citizen who pleaded guilty in U.S. federal court to conspiring to kill citizens of the United States as part of the September 11 attacks. As a result of his conviction, he is serving six life sentences without parole at the Federal ADX Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nOn August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested in Minnesota by the FBI and charged with an immigration violation. He aroused suspicion while taking flight training courses in Eagan, Minnesota.\n\nOn December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property.\n\nMoussaoui was alleged by federal prosecutors to have been a replacement for the \"first\" 20th hijacker, possibly Ramzi bin al-Shibh. Bin al-Shibh and Zakariyah Essabar were denied visas. However, prosecutors in Moussaoui's drawn-out trial in the US had difficulty directly connecting him to the 19 participants.\n\nMoussaoui's trial was seen in some circles as a barometer of the ability and willingness of the United States to give a fair hearing to terrorism suspects. Others objected to the degree to which the court and especially Judge Leonie Brinkema tolerated the bizarre and threatening courtroom behavior of Moussaoui. Moussaoui expressed contempt for the trial and court by introducing legal motions deriding Judge Brinkema, surprised onlookers by electing to represent himself in court, and rankled federal prosecutors by requesting the presence of captured al-Qaeda members as witnesses in his case.\n\nDuring the trial, Moussaoui initially stated that he was not involved in the September 11 attacks, but that he was planning an attack of his own. Some al-Qaeda members reportedly corroborated Moussaoui's statement to an extent, saying that he was involved in a plot other than September 11, but prosecutors believed that his story had no merit. On April 3, 2006, Moussaoui was found to be eligible for the death penalty. Before leaving the courtroom, he was reported to have shouted, \"You will never get my blood. God curse you all!\" Later that month he withdrew his qualifications and again admitted guilt on all charges levied by the prosecution.\n\nOn May 3, 2006, a jury decided against the death penalty for Moussaoui. The next day, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole. As he was led out of the courtroom, Moussaoui clapped his hands and said, \"America, you lost ... I won.\" Judge Brinkema responded by telling him that he would \"die with a whimper\" and \"never get a chance to speak again.\" According to the Associated Press, three jurors decided Moussaoui had only limited knowledge of the September 11 plot, and three described his role in the attacks as minor, if he had any role at all.\n\nFollowing sentencing, Moussaoui recanted his trial testimony stating he was not a member of the September 11, 2001, conspiracy, but \"part of another al-Qaeda plot which was to occur after September 11.\"\n\nAicha el-Wafi, Moussaoui's mother, was 14 when she was married to a man that she did not previously know, in Morocco. Five years later, Moussaoui's parents moved to France, where he was born. After enduring domestic violence, his mother left his father Omar while her four children were still young. She raised her children on a cleaner's wages. There was no religious education within the family. Witnesses testified at Moussaui's trial that, as first-generation immigrants from Morocco, the family frequently faced racism in their new country. From 1982, Moussaoui, his brother and sisters, were brought up in a bungalow on the edge of the town of Narbonne. His mother has said that she believes two 'wounding' incidents in his French adolescence contributed to the formation of an extremist sensibility: the first the day that his school careers adviser pushed him towards minor, technical studies, with \"the clear implication that he was only an Arab and would need nothing more,\" and the second the day that the father of his teenage sweetheart warned him off because he was an Arab. \"Don't think that you will ever get your feet under my table,\" the man said. \"\n\nAccording to his brother, Abd Samad Moussaoui, Zacarias loved to play handball:\n\nFor Zacarias [his brother wrote in \"the Guardian\"], handball quickly became more than a sport—it was his passion. He was brilliant. Everyone recognized it—his trainers, his team-mates, even his opponents. For Zacarias, the future was all mapped out. He would study and play sports.\n\nMoussaoui has been known by other names, reportedly including Abu Khaled al Sahrawi and Shaquil while he was in Oklahoma. He holds a master's degree in International Business from South Bank University in London, having enrolled in 1993 and graduated in 1995. He attended, amongst others, the Brixton Mosque, where he may have met Richard Reid, the future shoe bomber. He was proselytised by groups such as al-Muhajiroun (\"the Emigrants\"), who leafleted people attending moderate mosques such as that in Brixton. Moussaoui was expelled from the Brixton mosque after he began wearing combat fatigues and a backpack to the mosque, and pressured the cleric to provide him with information on how to join the \"jihad\". It is possible that he had connections with members of the Finsbury Park mosque, where the extremist Abu Hamza al-Masri taught.\n\nFrench authorities began monitoring Moussaoui in 1996 when they observed him with Islamic extremists in London. In 1998, he attended the Khalden training camp in Afghanistan, allegedly returning the next year as well. In September 2000, he visited Malaysia and stayed in a condominium owned by Yazid Sufaat who, in October 2000, signed letters identifying Moussaoui as a representative of his company. Two of the September 11 hijackers lived in the same condominium in January 2000. Jemaah Islamiah leader Riduan Ismauddin sent cohort Yazid Sufaat to provide Moussaoui with $35,000 USD and travel documents in Malaysia in October.\n\nFrom February 26 to May 29, 2001, Moussaoui attended flight training courses at Airman Flight School in Norman, Oklahoma. Despite 57 hours of flying lessons, he failed and left without ever having flown solo. This school was visited by Mohamed Atta and Marwan al-Shehhi, who piloted planes into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center.\n\nDuring his time in Norman, Moussaoui had a roommate named Hussein al-Attas. On August 11, 2001, Hussein al-Attas drove Moussaoui to Minnesota from Oklahoma. Hussein al-Attas said that he and Moussaoui planned to take a trip to New York City in late August/early September 2001. In 2002, al-Attas admitted that he lied to the FBI to conceal Moussaoui's name, lied to the inquisitive FBI to conceal Moussaoui's extremist jihadi and anti-American beliefs, lied to conceal his own tendencies, lied to conceal that Moussaoui had been trying to convince him to become more active in the jihad or struggle, and lied to conceal the names of other Middle Easterners who were taking flight lessons in Oklahoma.\n\nMoussaoui allegedly received US$14,000 in wire transfers from bin al-Shibh, originating from Düsseldorf and Hamburg, Germany, in early August. This money could have helped him pay for flight training about two weeks later at Pan-Am International Flight Academy in Eagan, Minnesota. On August 13, Moussaoui paid US$6,800 with US$100 bills to receive training in a 747-400 simulator. The simulator that Pan-Am uses is operated by Northwest Aerospace Training Corporation (NATCO), a training facility affiliated with Northwest Airlines. Moussaoui was reportedly considered as a replacement for Ziad Jarrah, who at one point threatened to withdraw from the scheme because of tensions amongst the plotters. Plans to include Moussaoui were never completed because the al-Qaeda hierarchy allegedly had doubts about his reliability.\n\nClarence Prevost, the flight instructor assigned to Moussaoui, began to have suspicions about his student. His behavior largely resembled that of other seemingly wealthy men who had come to the center in the past to receive jumbo jet training despite the fact that they'd probably never use it, but some characteristics were unusual. Prevost said later that in pre-simulator instruction, Moussaoui would ask questions that had the right jargon but were otherwise nonsensical. Moussaoui read through the 747 training manuals, but had a lack of understanding of the plane's systems. Prevost was confused as to why Moussaoui would seek simulator time if he lacked basic plane knowledge. After some convincing, his supervisors contacted the FBI, who came to meet with him. (Despite later reports, Moussaoui did not skip the training for takeoff and landing).\n\nOn August 16, 2001, Moussaoui was arrested by Harry Samit of the FBI and INS agents in Minnesota and charged with an immigration violation. Materials itemized when he was arrested included a laptop computer, two knives, flight manuals pertaining to Boeing's 747 aircraft, a flight simulator computer program, fighting gloves and shin guards, and a computer disk with information about crop dusting.\n\nSome agents worried that his flight training had violent intentions, so the Minnesota bureau tried to get permission (sending over 70 emails in a week) to search his laptop, but they were turned down. FBI agent Coleen Rowley made an explicit request for permission to search Moussaoui's personal rooms. This request was first denied by her superior, Deputy General Counsel Marion \"Spike\" Bowman, and later rejected based upon FISA regulations (amended after 9/11 by the USA Patriot Act). Several further search attempts similarly failed.\n\nAhmed Ressam, the captured al-Qaeda Millennium Bomber, was at the time sharing information with the US authorities, in an effort to gain leniency in his sentencing. One person whom he was not asked about until after 9/11, but whom he was able to identify when asked as having trained with him at al-Qaeda's Khalden Camp in Afghanistan, was Moussaoui. The 9/11 Commission Report opined that had Ressam been asked about Moussaoui, he would have broken the FBI's logjam. Had that happened, the Report opined, the U.S. might conceivably have disrupted or derailed the September 11 attacks altogether.\n\nOn December 11, 2001, Moussaoui was indicted by a federal grand jury in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on six felony charges: conspiracy to commit acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries, conspiracy to commit aircraft piracy, conspiracy to destroy aircraft, conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to murder United States employees, and conspiracy to destroy property. The indictment of Zacarias Moussaoui named as unindicted co-conspirators Ramzi Bin al-Shibh and Mustafa al-Hawsawi, among others, for their role in the attack \"to murder thousands of innocent people in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\"\n\nOn January 2, 2002, Moussaoui refused to enter any plea to the charges and so Judge Leonie Brinkema entered pleas of not guilty. A hearing was held on April 22, 2002, to determine his right to self-representation, for by then Moussaoui had declined the assistance of his court-appointed attorneys, and asked to defend himself. At another hearing on June 13, 2002, Brinkema deemed him competent to defend himself and allowed the case to move forward. However, Moussaoui later requested the occasional assistance of attorneys to help him with technical issues.\n\nMoussaoui admitted his involvement with al-Qaeda, but claimed he was not involved in the 9/11 attacks. Rather, he claimed that he was preparing for a separate attack. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed had earlier told investigators that Moussaoui met with him prior to September 11, but that he, Mohammed, chose not to use him. No evidence directly linking Moussaoui to the 9/11 attacks has yet been released.\n\nThe trial highlighted a tension in the United States between the judiciary and national security. Moussaoui made requests for access to confidential documents and the right to call captive al-Qaeda members as witnesses, notably bin al-Shibh, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi. Both requests were claimed by prosecutors to be potential threats to national security. Brinkema denied the motion to access confidential documents, although Moussaoui was permitted to use several al-Qaeda prisoners as witnesses.\n\nBrinkema put the death penalty \"off limits\" on October 2, 2003, in reply to government defiance of her order to provide access to Moussaoui's witnesses. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Brinkema ruling, holding that the U.S. government could use summaries of interviews/interrogations of these witnesses. On March 21, 2005, the United States Supreme Court, without comment, declined to hear Moussaoui's pre-trial appeal of the Fourth Circuit's decision, returning the case to Brinkema.\n\nOn April 22, 2005, in one of the court sessions near the end of that phase of the proceedings, Moussaoui surprised the whole court by pleading guilty to all charges, while at the same time denying having any intention to produce a massacre like 9/11. He said that it was not his conspiracy, and that he intended to free Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman. According to Moussaoui, his master plan was to hijack a Boeing 747-400, since the plane is one of a few that could reach Afghanistan from the U.S. without any intermediate stops.\n\nOn February 6, 2006, Moussaoui shouted \"I am al-Qaeda. They do not represent me; they are Americans,\" referring to his attorneys while being escorted from the courtroom in front of 120 potential jurors.\n\nIn March 2006, during the Moussaoui trial, several premises made headlines, including FBI agents stating that the bureau was aware, years before the attacks in 2001, that al-Qaeda planned to use planes to destroy important buildings, and Brinkema's decision to consider dismissal of the death penalty. However, days later, under significant media attention, Brinkema decided not to dismiss the case, and instead ruled that witnesses could not testify and the government would be allowed to continue to seek the death sentence against him.\n\nOn March 27, 2006, Moussaoui testified that he and \"shoe bomber\" Richard Reid had planned to crash a hijacked airplane into the White House in the September 11 attacks. No direct connection between Moussaoui and Reid had ever before been alleged, and this testimony contradicted earlier testimony by Moussaoui that he had been intended for an operation after September 11. When asked why he had previously lied, he stated that \"You're allowed to lie for jihad. You're allowed any technique to defeat your enemy.\" There has been commentary in the mainstream media that Moussaoui's preference to die as an identified 9/11 plotter rather than receive a life sentence as a member of an unrealized scheme throws doubt on his self-admitted connection to 9/11.\n\nMoussaoui refused legal representation for years; he entered confusing, insulting, and parallel court pleadings. His pleadings, statements, and behavior included the following:\n\nJanuary 2, 2002: Moussaoui stated, \"In the name of Allah, I do not have anything to plea, and I enter no plea.\"\n\nApril 22, 2002: Moussaoui tried to fire his court-appointed lawyers. Judge Brinkema took the request under advisement; on June 13, 2002, she ordered that he had the right to defend himself, and a search began for a Muslim lawyer. Moussaoui cited several suras of the Qur'an—including Al-i-imran 3:118, Al-anfal 8:36, Al-anfal 8:45, Al-i-Imran 3:175 and Al-An-am 6:162—to the judge as justification for firing his lawyers, proof of the government's and judge's corruption, confirmation of his innocence, and assurance that he was taking the best possible course of defense. He then prayed to Allah for the return of Al-Andalus (Spain and Portugal) and the deliverance of Ceuta, Melilla, India and Kashmir to the Muslims. He also prayed for the destruction of several nations—including Israel (and the Jewish people as a whole), Russia, Canada, UK, Australia, and the U.S.—and for the liberation of Palestine, Chechnya, and Afghanistan. The Court ordered a psychiatric evaluation in response.\n\nJune 7, 2002: A court-appointed psychiatrist declared Moussaoui sufficiently competent for trial.\n\nJune 11, 2002: Moussaoui filed a motion, titled \"Motion for pre-contempt of Leonie Brinkema order to declare Zacarias Moussaoui crazy\", which insisted on his competence to stand trial. In it, he said he had tried \"to get the help of the European Court of Justice and Parliaments\". He then offered a psychological analysis of Judge Brinkema:\nMental Status Enumeration: Axis 1; Acute symptoms of Islamophobia with complex of gender inferiority.\n\nDiagnostic Impressions: Legal pathological killer instinct with egoboasting dementia to become supreme.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations: Immediate psychiatric hospitalization to specialist unit (propose unit UBL treatment center ... )\n\nJuly 18, 2002: Moussaoui entered a guilty plea, stating, \"I have knowledge and I participated in al-Qaeda. I am a member of al-Qaeda ... I pledge bayat to Osama bin Laden.\" The Court rejected the guilty plea as unconsidered and ordered Moussaoui to rethink his plea.\n\nJuly 24, 2002: Moussaoui's roommate from Oklahoma flight school, 24-year-old Hussein al-Attas, pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements, including the following:\n\nThe truth is that on several occasions, during the short time I knew him (Moussaoui) had expressed a general desire to participate in jihad, so my statement to the contrary was false ... When the agents asked if I (also) knew his real name, I lied and said I did not.\n\nAl-Attas stated that he told the FBI he was going to Pakistan to seek medical assistance for a sick relative in Saudi Arabia, but admitted, \"The real reason was (Moussaoui) had convinced me to go to speak to Islamic scholars and others who hold the belief that Islamic religion favors participation in jihad.\"\n\nFurthermore, al-Attas admitted to lying about his plans to go with Moussaoui to New York City in late August, 2001. He also confessed that he lied about some of Moussaoui's classmates at an Oklahoma flight school.\n\nJuly 28, 2002: Moussaoui pleaded guilty to four of six counts of conspiracy. He denied charges of conspiracy to murder United States employees and destroy property.\n\nToday, I truthfully will enter on some of the charges, not all, a plea of guilty ... It should not be misunderstood that I endorse the entire indictment. There is enough factual basis for me to plead guilty in a truthful manner.\n\nThe Court rejected the guilty plea as too informal and reappointed his counsel. Moussaoui's response to this order to work with court-appointed counsel was, \"It is most disgusting.\"\n\nApril 22, 2003: Moussaoui filed a pleading with the header shown below. In the pleading, Judge Brinkema is referred to as \"Death Judge Leonie\".\nIn the Name of Allah; Censured by the United Sodom of America\n\n4/19/2003; Case No. 01455A; 17 S 1423\nSlave of Allah, Zacharias Moussaoui vs. \nSlave of Satan, John Ashcroft\n\nJuly 18, 2003: Moussaoui filed two pleadings. The first was titled \"Wanted for WTC Bankruptcy\" and offered an accounting of \"WTC profit and loss\" of \"Loss: 3000 sons of evil. Profit: 19 slaves of Allah.\" That document had the following header: \nIn the Name of Allah; Censured by the United Satan of America\nSlave of Allah, Zacharias Moussaoui vs.\nSlave of Satan, Bush and Ashcroft\n\nThe second pleading was titled \"No Pig Man Role in Moussaoui Deliverance Scenario\" and stated \"To be seen in all God Fearing World Theatre Cinema. Deadline for 3000+ hotseat tickets (please contact United Booking Limited).\"\n\nMarch 21, 2006: In response to al-Atta's testimony, Moussaoui commented, \"God Bless Mohammed Atta.\"\n\nMay 6, 2006: In an affidavit filed by his attorneys after the trial, Moussaoui stated,\n\nAdditional case filings are posted online.\n\nMoussaoui, charged with conspiring to hijack planes and crash them into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, was in jail in Minnesota when the Sept. 11 attacks unfolded. In seeking a death sentence, prosecutors were required to prove that he \"intentionally participated in an act ... and the victim died as a direct result of the act.\" Moussaoui admitted he knew about the attacks and did nothing to stop them.\n\nHaving entered a guilty plea, Moussaoui was eligible for the death penalty. Germany said it would not release evidence against Moussaoui unless the U.S. promised not to seek death as punishment. On April 27, 2005, French Justice Minister Dominique Perben said, \"When France gave elements of information about Mr Moussaoui to the American justice, I obtained a written engagement of the United States not to use these elements to require or execute the death penalty.\"\n\nOn March 14, 2006, Brinkema ruled that the prosecution could continue to seek the death penalty against Moussaoui, but could not use key witnesses coached by government lawyer Carla Martin. On April 3, 2006, the jury in his case decided that Moussaoui was eligible for the death penalty.\n\nAt Moussaoui's sentencing trial, FBI agent Greg Jones testified that prior to the attacks, he urged his supervisor, Michael Maltbie, \"to prevent Zacarias Moussaoui from flying a plane into the World Trade Center.\" Maltbie had refused to act on 70 requests from another agent, Harry Samit, to obtain a warrant to search Moussaoui's computer.\n\nOn May 3, 2006, the jury reached a verdict: that Moussaoui be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Moussaoui was sentenced to six consecutive life terms on May 4, as Judge Brinkema expressed her belief that the sentence was an appropriate one, inasmuch as it would deprive Moussaoui of \"martyrdom in a great big bang of glory\" and of the \"chance to speak again\", after Moussaoui entered the courtroom proclaiming his victory and asserting that the United States would \"never get Osama bin Laden\". As he was leaving the courtroom he said, \"America, you lost and I won.\" And he clapped his hands twice. A single juror saved Moussaoui from death. The foreman of the 12-person federal jury told \"The Washington Post\" that the panel voted 11–1, 10–2 and 10–2 in favor of the death penalty on the three charges for which Moussaoui was eligible for execution. A unanimous vote on any one of the three terrorism charges was required to return a death sentence.\n\nOn May 8, 2006, Moussaoui filed papers with the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia requesting to withdraw his guilty plea, stating that his earlier claim of participation in the September 11 plot was a \"complete fabrication.\" He said that he was \"extremely surprised\" that he was not sentenced to death. \"I now see that it is possible that I can receive a fair trial even with Americans as jurors,\" he said. However, federal sentencing rules forbid pleas to be withdrawn after a sentence has already been executed, and Moussaoui had already waived his rights to appeal.\n\nOn May 13, 2006, Moussaoui was moved from his holding cell in Alexandria, Virginia and transported via JPATS to the supermax United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility, located near Florence, Colorado. The facility—considered the most secure federal penitentiary—is called the \"Alcatraz of the Rockies\". He has the Federal Bureau of Prisons number 51427-054.\n\nOn July 31, 2006, the 1,202 exhibits presented during the case of \"United States v. Zacarias Moussaoui\" were posted online, marking the first time the exhibits of a criminal case in U.S. courts were so published.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, Judge Brinkema publicly stated that the US government had provided incorrect information about evidence in the Moussaoui trial and that due to those actions, she was considering ordering a new trial in a related terrorism case, that of Ali al-Timimi, a Virginia Muslim cleric. Brinkema said that she could no longer trust the CIA and other government agencies on how they represent classified evidence in cases regarding terrorism after Moussaoui case prosecutors admitted that the CIA had assured her that no videotapes or audiotapes existed of interrogations of certain high-profile terrorism detainees, but later, in a letter made public November 13, two such videotapes and one audio tape were made known. According to his testimony, the citizen had training in accounting and organized the Al Qaeda's finances.\n\nOn May 23, 2006, an audio recording attributed to Osama bin Laden said in translation that Moussaoui \"had no connection at all with September 11 ... I am the one in charge of the 19 brothers and I never assigned brother Zacarias to be with them in that mission ... Since Zacarias Moussaoui was still learning to fly, he wasn't number 20 in the group, as your government claimed\". The voice alleged to be bin Laden also suggested that Moussaoui's confession was \"void\" as it was a result of pressures applied during his incarceration.\n\nCivil action is being taken by relatives of September 11 attacks victims, insurers and others against the Saudi Arabian government. In the course of this Zacarias Moussaoui has stated on oath and wrote to Judge George B. Daniels that Saudi royal family members helped finance the September 11 attacks and al-Qaeda. Prince Turki bin Faisal Al Saud, Prince Bandar Bin Sultan and Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, of the Saudi royal family were specifically mentioned as Al-Qaeda donors—but the project's major patrons was Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who in January 2015 became Saudi Arabia's king. Moussaoui's testimony provides new details of the extent and nature of that support in the pre-9/11 period. Judge Leonie M. Brinkema declared \"Moussaoui is completely competent\", called him \"an extremely intelligent man\" and added: \"He has actually a better understanding of the legal system than some lawyers I've seen in court\".\n\nThe former Senators Bob Graham of Florida and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and the former Navy secretary John Lehman believe the Saudi role in the 9/11 plot has never been adequately examined and they demand the release of 28 pages of the congressional report that explored Saudi connections and remain classified. Both the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama have refused to declassify the 28 pages on grounds of \"national security\", but as Graham argues the opposite is true the real \"threat to national security is non-disclosure\": The Saudis know what they did and the U.S. knows what they did, and when the U.S. government takes a position of passivity, or actively shuts down inquiry, that sends a message to the Saudis. \"They have continued, maybe accelerated their support for the most extreme form of Islam known as Wahhabism\" he stated, arguing that both al Qaeda and Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant are \"a creation of Saudi Arabia.\" On January 7, 2015, Graham, Congressmen Walter Jones and Stephen F. Lynch, and members of the 9/11 families including Terry Strada, national co-chair of the ″9/11 Families and Survivors United for Justice Against Terrorism″ held a press conference on Capitol Hill announcing the reintroduction of the resolution calling for the declassification of the 28 pages. Graham said that those pages \"point a very strong finger at Saudi Arabia as the principal financier\" of the 9/11 hijackers: \"This may seem stale to some but it's as current as the headlines we see today,\" referring to the terrorist attack on a satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Clarence Prevost, the flight instructor who led authorities to Moussaoui, received a $5 million reward from the U.S. government. The payment was questioned by agent Coleen Rowley and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Norm Coleman, among others, on the basis that two other flight instructors had made the initial calls to the FBI.\n\n\n\n"}
