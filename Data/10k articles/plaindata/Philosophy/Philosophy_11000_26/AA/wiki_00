The code establishes standards for auditor independence, integrity and objectivity, responsibilities to clients and colleagues and acts discreditable to the accounting profession. The AICPA is responsible for drafting, revising and reissuing the code annually, on June 1. The current Code is available at the AICPA Web site. For older versions of the Code, see the links below.\n\nJoseph Edmund Sterrett outlined the debate and issues in setting up a Code of Professional Conduct in his address to the annual meeting of the American Association of Public Accountants in 1907 The earliest \"official\" version of the code of professional conduct among American accountants was issued by the American Institute of Accountants on April 9, 1917.\n\nThe opening principle of the code is that membership, and therefore adherence, to the code is voluntary. This means that an accountant is never under a legal responsibility to adhere to the code, and can renounce the code and membership in the AICPA at any time.\n\nSection 101 sets forth the various requirements to establish auditor independence and conditions that nullify it. Knowingly allowing a member who is not independent to continue to work on an engagement can result in disciplinary action from the AICPA, including possible revocation of the members status as a CPA. Generally, the following actions will impair auditor independence:\n\nAuditor independence is impaired if a member on the engagement team has a direct or material indirect financial interest in the client. Member's on the engagement team are not allowed to be on the board of trustees of a trust that owns, or has committed to owning more than 10% of the client's equity. A member or any of their immediate family are not allowed to own more than 5% of the clients equity. For the period being audited, the auditor is not allowed to operate as an officer, director, manager, promoter, underwriter or voting trustee for the client. If a member leaves the auditing firm and is employed by the client, the entire firms independence is deemed to be impaired. If an audit member is made a job offer by the client and does not immediately report and remove themselves from the engagement, their independence is impaired. However, if the member does report the job offer and rejects it, and is no longer being considered for a position with the client, then their independence is not impaired.\n\nWhen the auditing member has a previous employment relationship with the client, barring certain exceptions, the auditor is required to liquidate any employee welfare programs that they have vested benefits in and collect or pay any loans outstanding to the client. The immediate family of the auditor is considered part of the test for impairment of independence. The exception to this is that the immediate family members of auditors are allowed to work for the client in non-management roles. If the auditor provides non-attest services such as tax support or consulting, they are required to adhere to the independence requirements of other regulatory bodies that govern those services. Failure to do so will impair their independence for their audit engagement as well.\n"}

Known after his conversion as Alfonso of Valladolid.\n\nAs a student he acquired a certain mastery in Biblical and Talmudical studies, to which he added an intimate acquaintance with Peripatetic philosophy and astrology. He was graduated as a physician at 25, but throughout a long life he seems to have found the struggle for existence a hard one. In 1295, he reportedly treated a number of Jews for distress following their experiences in the failed messianic movement in Avila. As Abner reports in his \"Moreh Zedek/Mostrador de justicia,\" he himself \"had a dream\" in which a similar experience of crosses mysteriously appearing on his garments drove him to question his ancestral faith.\n\nNot being of those contented ones who, as Moses Narboni says in his \"Maamar ha-Beḥirah\" (Essay on the Freedom of the Will; quoted by Grätz, p. 488), are satisfied with a peck of locust beans from one Friday to another, he resolved to embrace Christianity though at the advanced age of sixty, according to Pablo de Santa María (\"Scrutinium Scripturarum\"); according to other writers he took this step soon after he was graduated in medicine. According to the statements of his contemporaries, such as Narboni, he converted, not from spiritual conviction, but for the sake of temporal advantage. Something of the apostate's pricking conscience seems to have remained with him, however, although he was immediately rewarded with a sacristan's post in the prominent Metropolitan Church in Valladolid (whence he took the name of Alfonso of Valladolid). The argument that Abner converted for material gain is put into question by the fact that his post as a sacristan was extremely modest and he never, throughout his long and public polemical career after conversion (c. 1320-1347) advanced in his post to something more lucrative.\n\nAbner's most distinguishing characteristic was his use of postbiblical literature, including hundreds of Talmudic and Midrashic sources as well as much medieval Jewish and Arabic (in translation) literature, all in an effort to prove the truth of Christianity. Equally striking is the fact that he wrote his anti-Judaism polemics in Hebrew, unlike virtually every polemicist in the history of Christianity. His most major work, the \"Moreh Zedek\" (Teacher of Righteousness), which now survives only in a 14th-century Castilian translation as \"Mostrador de Justicia\", is one of the longest and most elaborate polemics against Judaism ever written and is one of the key sources for the history of anti-Jewish thought in thirteenth and fourteenth century Western Europe. Abner's text rivals (and in many ways surpasses) the \"Pugio Fidei\" in length, complexity, variety of sources, and psychological impact, although there is no evidence that Abner actually knew of the polemical Dominican work.\n\nIn an essay entitled \"Minhat Qenaot\" (A Jealousy Offering), he argued that man's actions are determined by planetary influence, and he reinterpreted the notion of choice and free will in light of that determinism. Both his conversion and this defense of determinism aroused protests from his former Jewish study-partner, Isaac Pulgar, marked by great bitterness. Abner also exchanged a number of polemical letters with local Jews, which have survived along with the responses by each and the final riposte to all the letters by Abner, a short work known as the \"Teshuvot ha-Meshubot\".\n\nAbner presented charges before Alfonso XI of Castile, accusing his former brethren of using a prayer-formula in their ritual which blasphemed the Christian God and cursed all Christians. The king ordered a public investigation at Valladolid, in which the representatives of the Jewish community were confronted with Abner. The conclusion was announced in the shape of a royal edict forbidding the use of the formula in question (February, 1336); a barren victory on both sides, for the Jews had no idea of ever using it, and Abner failed to prove that they had. He further accused the Jews, for instance, of constantly warring among themselves and splitting into hostile religious schisms; in support of this statement he adduces an alleged list of the \"sects\" prevailing among them: Sadducees, Samaritans, and other extinct division. He makes two \"sects\" of Pharisees and Rabbinites, says that cabalists believe in a tenfold God, and speaks of a brand-new \"sect\" believing in a dual Deity, God and Metatron.\n\nThe following is a list of Abner's writings:\n\nSome of his lost works may include:\n\nSome of the works falsely attributed to him include:\n\n\n---. \"From Testimonia to Testimony: Thirteenth-Century Anti-Jewish Polemic and the \"Moreh Zedek/Mostrador de justicia\" of Abner of Burgos/ Alfonso of Valladolid.\" Diss.

{"id": "2793994", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2793994", "title": "Aletheia", "text": "Aletheia\n\nAletheia (Ancient Greek: ) is truth or disclosure in philosophy. It was used in Ancient Greek philosophy and revived in the 20th century by Martin Heidegger.\n\nIt is a Greek word variously translated as \"unclosedness\", \"unconcealedness\", \"disclosure\" or \"truth\". The literal meaning of the word is \"the state of not being hidden; the state of being evident.\" It also means factuality or reality. It is the opposite of lethe, which literally means \"oblivion\", \"forgetfulness\", or \"concealment\". According to Pindar's Olympian Ode, Aletheia is the daughter of Zeus, while Aesop in his Fables said that she was crafted by Prometheus.\n\nIn the early to mid 20th-century, Martin Heidegger brought renewed attention to the concept of \"aletheia\", by relating it to the notion of disclosure, or the way in which things appear as entities in the world. While he initially referred to \"aletheia\" as \"truth\", specifically a form that is pre-Socratic in origin, Heidegger eventually corrected this interpretation, writing:\n\nTo raise the question of \"aletheia\", of disclosure as such, is not the same as raising the question of truth. For this reason, it was inadequate and misleading to call \"aletheia\", in the sense of opening, truth.\"\n\nHeidegger gave an etymological analysis of \"aletheia\" and drew out an understanding of the term as 'unconcealedness'. Thus, \"aletheia\" is distinct from conceptions of truth understood as statements which accurately describe a state of affairs (correspondence), or statements which fit properly into a system taken as a whole (coherence). Instead, Heidegger focused on the elucidation of how an ontological \"world\" is disclosed, or opened up, in which things are made intelligible for human beings in the first place, as part of a holistically structured background of meaning.\n\nHeidegger also wrote that \"\"Aletheia\", disclosure regarded as the opening of presence, is not yet truth. Is \"aletheia\" then less than truth? Or is it more because it first grants truth as \"adequatio\" and \"certitudo\", because there can be no presence and presenting outside of the realm of the opening?\"\n\nHeidegger began his discourse on the reappropriation of \"aletheia\" in his magnum opus, \"Being and Time\" (1927), and expanded on the concept in his \"Introduction to Metaphysics\". For more on his understanding of \"aletheia\", see \"Poetry, Language, and Thought\", in particular the essay entitled \"The Origin of the Work of Art\", which describes the value of the work of art as a means to open a \"clearing\" for the appearance of things in the world, or to disclose their meaning for human beings. Heidegger revised his views on \"aletheia\" as truth, after nearly forty years, in the essay \"The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking,\" in \"On Time and Being\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1176563", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1176563", "title": "Anti-foundationalism", "text": "Anti-foundationalism\n\nAnti-foundationalism (also called nonfoundationalism) is any philosophy which rejects a foundationalist approach. An anti-foundationalist is one who does not believe that there is some fundamental belief or principle which is the basic ground or foundation of inquiry and knowledge.\n\nAnti-foundationalists use logical or historical or genealogical attacks on foundational concepts (see especially Nietzsche and Foucault), often coupled with alternative methods for justifying and forwarding intellectual inquiry, such as the pragmatic subordination of knowledge to practical action. Foucault dismissed the search for a return to origins as Platonic essentialism, preferring to stress the contingent nature of human practices.\n\nAnti-foundationalists oppose metaphysical methods. Moral and ethical anti-foundationalists are often criticized for moral relativism, but anti-foundationalists often dispute this charge, offering alternative methods of moral thought that they claim do not require foundations. Thus while Charles Taylor accused Foucault of having \"no order of human life, or way we are, or human nature, that one can appeal to in order to judge or evaluate between ways of life\", Foucault nevertheless insists on the need for continuing ethical enquiry \"without\" any universal system to appeal to.\n\nNiklas Luhmann used cybernetics to challenge the role of foundational unities and canonical certainties.\n\nAntifoundationalists oppose totalising visions of social, scientific or historical reality, considering them to lack legitimation, and preferring local narratives instead. No social totality but a multitude of local and concrete practices; \"not \"a\" history but at best histories\". In such neopragmatism, there is no overall truth, merely an ongoing process of better and more fruitful methods of edification. Even our most taken for granted categories for social analysis—of gender, sex, race, and class—are considered by anti-essentialists like Marjorie Garber as social constructs.\n\nStanley Fish distinguishes between what he calls \"antifoundationalist theory hope\" and \"antifoundationalist theory fear\"—finding them however both equally illusory. \n\nFear of the corrosive effects of antifoundationalism was widespread in the late twentieth century, anticipating such things as a cultural meltdown and moral anarchy, or (at the least) a loss of the necessary critical distance to allow for leverage against the status quo. For Fish, however, the threat of a loss of objective standards of rational enquiry with the disappearance of any founding principle was a false fear: far from opening the way to an unbridled subjectivity, antifoundationalism leaves the individual firmly entrenched within the conventional context and standards of enquiry/dispute of the discipline/profession/habitus within which s/he is irrevocably placed.\n\nBy the same token, however, the antifoundationalist \"hope\" of escaping local situations through awareness of the contingency of all such situations—through recognition of the conventional/rhetorical nature of all claims to master principles—that hope is to Fish equally foredoomed by the very nature of the situational consciousness, the all-embracing social and intellectual context, in which every individual is separately enclosed.\n\nFish has also noted how, in contradistinction to hopes of an emancipatory outcome from antifoundationalism, anti-essentialist theories arguing for the absence of a transcontextual point of reference have been put to conservative and neo-conservative, as well as progressive, ends. Thus, for example, John Searle has offered an account of the construction of social reality fully compatible with the acceptance stance of \"the man who is at home in his society, the man who is \"chez lui\" in the social institutions of the society...as comfortable as the fish in the sea\".\n\nAntifoundationalists have been criticised for attacking all general claims \"except\" their own; for offering a localizing rhetoric contradicted in practice by their own globalizing style.\n\nEdward Said condemned radical anti-foundationalism for excessive cultural relativism and overdependence on the linguistic turn at the expense of human realities.\n\n\n"}

This original Indonesian word is very philosophical, since it has been explained, interpreted, re-interpreted, and made a philosophical discourse in Indonesian philosophers' circle up to this time. Indonesian philosophy world is not considered as complete without mentioning this discourse. Its derivatives, such as Budayawan, Budiman, and Budi daya, are now also discussed among Indonesian philosophers, especially those who are called philosophers of Kebudayaan.\n\nPhilosophers of the various schools of philosophy define the word \"Budi\" (plural, \"Budaya\") with different definitions, suited to their school interests. The oldest definition of the word is found in the 18th century Ancient Javanese manuscript \"Serat Centhini\". According to the text, \"Budi\" is suprahuman, spiritual entity which mediates between God's being and human's being. It is a purely spiritual substance originated from God. Here is the excerpt:\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nIt is the Budi with this meaning that is used by Dr. Wahidin Soedirohusodo to name his and his fellows' first native political society Budi Utomo in the Dutch East Indies of the early 19th century.\n\nThe \"Budi\" in this meaning is also similar to the Sufi concept of Nur Muhammad or the Platonic concept of The Universal Soul or the Islamic philosophical concept of Al-'Aql Al-Awwal.\n\nModern European learning introduced by the Portuguese-Spanish Catholics and the Dutch Protestants to Indonesian native educational institutions in the 20th century influenced the definition of the word \"Budi\". In this intellectual period, \"Budi\" is re-defined and re-interpreted not as spiritual as understood before, but as human entity. In 1961, for example, Nicolas Drijarkara defined \"Budi\" as \"ethical reason\" or \"moral reason\" as understood by the moralist Immanuel Kant. Poedjawijatna, another philosopher, defined \"Budi\" as Indonesian translation of the English word \"reason\" or \"reasoning\" and \"Filsafat Budi\" as of the English word \"Logics\". Ki Hajar Dewantara, a preeminent Javanese thinker, in the early 1970s defined \"Budi \" as the matured human soul. Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana, a great Indonesian thinker of the century, defined \"Budi\" as psychological pattern contained in it basic life needs, instincts, feelings, thought, passions and fantasies. Here is the excerpt: \n\nThe philosopher in Indonesian history of philosophy who firstly understood \"Budi\" (or more frequently, \"Kebudayaan\") as culture is Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana (1908–1994).Koentjaraningrat, an American-trained anthropologist, then continued using the meaning in his famous book, \"Manusia dan Kebudayaan di Indonesia\". Sidi Gazalba, another philosopher of \"Kebudayaan\", defined \"Budi\" or \"Kebudayaan\" as a way of life owned and held by any cultural unity. Today's Indonesian thinkers, like Sutan Syahrir, Soedjatmoko, Dick Hartoko, Abdurrahman Wahid, Mochtar Kusumaatmaja, Mochtar Lubis, Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo, Y.B. Mangunwijaya, Nurcholish Madjid, Darmanto Jatman, and other modernists, hold this cultural-anthropological meaning of \"Budi\". It can even be said that this meaning has been dominating the philosophical discourse of today. All philosophers holding this meaning has been acknowledged nationally as \"Philosophers of Kebudayaan\".\n"}

He is recognised as a key contributor to the field of environmental history.\n\nGlacken was born and raised in Sacramento, California, attending Sacramento Junior College (now Sacramento City College). He studied history and interdisciplinary studies at Berkeley (BA with highest honors 1930, MA in 1931, Department of Social Institutions). In the 1930s and 1940s, as America faced the Great Depression, he held several government jobs including a job with the Farm Security Administration assisting refugees fleeing the Mid West Dust Bowl and unemployment, in the Central Valley of California. In 1937, he travelled alone for a year through Europe and Asia, sparking his interest in the relationship between human ideas and the natural world.\n\nIn 1941, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, becoming an analyst and expert in Japanese language and culture. Discharged at the end of the war he took a job in Korea at the military government's Bureau of Health and Welfare, and found time for some geographical study of land cover change.\n\nThese experiences experience led to a desire to pursue scholarship. He finished a PhD in Geography at Johns Hopkins University when in his forties, called “The Idea of the Habitable World.” (1949-1951). Later he undertook an ethnography of three villages in Okinawa, using his language skills, working for the Pacific Science Board of the National Research Council from 1951-2. The study was later published as a book (Glacken, 1955).\n\nIn 1952, he was appointed by Carl Sauer as Assistant Professor of Geography at the University of California, Berkeley, later becoming Professor.

Socially, a married couple is the basic unit of the population; sometimes marriages can affect the country’s political stability and international relations (especially to certain foreign tribes like Mongolians, Manchus, Huns, and Turks); thus marriage can be related to politics.\n\nFrom the point of view of Confucian philosophy, one of the purposes of marriage is the cultivation of virtue. The Chinese have seen that marriage () should be founded on love since the concept of monogamy is rooted in their mindset. Ideographically, ‘’hūn’’ (婚) is identical to ‘’hūn’’ (昏, literally means an evening; a dusk) in ancient writings, though the former has the radical (Chinese character) ‘’nǔ’’ (女, literally means a female). Similarly, ‘’yīn’’ (姻) is the same as ‘’yīn’’ (因). According to Zhang Yi’s (張揖) (), a dictionary for ancient Chinese characters, ‘’yīn’’ (因) means friendliness, love and harmony, indicating that correct way of living for a married couple.\n\nDue to the concept of filial piety and following rites of propriety, marriage was a costly affair and seen as second only to funeral ceremonies. The use of a matchmaker was meant to ensure that the husband and wife were compatible with each other, but primarily worked in the families' best interests.\n\n\n"}

Stere or Constantin Sterea (Romanian; , \"Konstantin Yegorovich Stere\" or Константин Георгиевич Стере, \"Konstantin Georgiyevich Stere\"; also known under his pen name \"Șărcăleanu\"; June 1, 1865 – June 26, 1936) was a Romanian writer, jurist, politician, ideologue of the \"Poporanist\" trend, and, in March 1906, co-founder (together with Garabet Ibrăileanu and Paul Bujor — the latter was afterwards replaced by the physician Ioan Cantacuzino) of the literary magazine \"Viața Românească\". One of the central figures of the Bessarabian intelligentsia at the time, Stere was a key actor during the Union of Bessarabia with Romania in 1918, and is associated with its legacy.\n\nConstantin Stere was professor of Administrative and Constitutional law at the University of Iaşi, serving as its rector between 1913 and 1916. He is also remembered for his partly autobiographical novel \"În preajma revoluției\" (literal translation: \"On the Eve of the Revolution\" — in reference to the Russian Revolution of 1917).\n\nHe was born in Horodiște, Soroca County, to a family of boyar origins from Ciripcău, Bessarabia — which was part of the Russian Empire at the time. Stere was one of the three sons of an ethnic Romanian couple of Russian citizens: Gheorghe or Iorgu Stere (known as \"Yegor Stepanovich Stere\", Егор Степанович Стере in Russian), a landowner whose family was originally from Botoșani County in the Romanian part of Moldavia, and Pulcheria (Пулкерия), a member of the impoverished gentry in Bessarabia. He spent most of his early years, until the age of eight, in Ciripcău, where the family manor was located.\n\nAround 1874, he graduated from a Chișinău private school where classes were taught German, and entered the school for \"dvoryane\" in the city, where he became close friends with Alexandru Grosu and Lev Matveyevich Kogan-Bernstein (who were the basis for the characters \"Sașa Lungu\" and \"Moise Roitman\" in Stere's novel). It was also around this time that he became acquainted with progressive, utopian socialist, and Darwinist ideas (notably reading the works of Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Alexander Herzen, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Ferdinand Lassalle, and Peter Lavrovich Lavrov). Stere later indicated that, before the late 1870s, he could not spell the Romanian alphabet, which had just been adopted over the border (\"see Romanian Cyrillic alphabet\"), and had to rely on a few books smuggled into Bessarabia for getting a sense of literary Romanian.\n\nWhile still students, Stere and Kogan-Bernstein engaged in revolutionary politics as socialists and Narodniks, initiating a conspirative \"self-instruction\" cell of six inside their school. The group was affiliated with Narodnaya Volya, and Stere was responsible for multiplying and distributing locally the manifesto issued by the latter after it had assassinated Emperor Alexander II. This was also the first moment when Stere declared his opposition to a Social democratic program, a Narodnik-inspired objection which would later form one of the tenets of his doctrine.\n\nHe was first arrested in late 1883, after Okhrana units decapitated the Bessarabian wing of the Narodnaya Volya. Detained in Odessa (during which time he read intensely), Stere was frequently visited by Maria Grosu, the sister of Alexandru, who had fallen in love with him — a Narodnik and a feminist, she asked Stere for a marriage of convenience that was meant to help her become free from parental tutelage (according to the laws of the Russian Empire, unmarried women were under their father's protection). Stere agreed, and they were married in the prison chapel (1885).\n\nIn 1885, he was deported to Siberia, serving a three-year term. Briefly kept in Tyumen prison awaiting transport further east, he was sent to Kurgan in the custody of two gendarmes (October). He was joined there by Maria, who gave birth to their son Roman in 1886. Moving to Turinsk, the Steres joined a group of revolutionaries in internal exile; Constantin Stere agreed to print copies of a Narodnik magazine, using a hectograph, and was exposed during a raid by authorities. He was swiftly taken to Tobolsk, then shipped down the Irtysh to the place where it met the Ob; he traveled to the village of Sharkala (the northernmost part of Siberia he ever reached) in a Khanty canoe, and was then settled in Beryozovsky District, only to be arrested again and sent back to Tobolsk in the autumn of 1888.\n\nHe was tried for his activities in Turinsk, based on evidence collected by the Okhrana. While in prison, Stere, who was beginning to distance himself from socialism and proletarian internationalism, argued in front of authorities that mention of his change in attitude was supposed to be kept by the court when passing the verdict. At the time, a physician who examined him noted that he had suffered a nervous breakdown, and had him moved to a prison hospital. According to most accounts, he had attempted suicide (a gesture caused by either the death of one of his brothers, who had himself committed suicide, or by news that the Narodnik leader Lev Tikhomirov had become a supporter of the political establishment). In hospital, Stere stated that:\n\"Quite a while ago have I begun to remove myself from the influence of political exiles and their tradition. Recent times, filled with major hardships for me, I have decided firmly and sincerely to break with these traditions, as well as with all things «illegal» in my past.\"\n\nInstead, he became familiar with Neo-Kantian philosophy, expanding on his interest in Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" (which he was reading in Beryozovsky District). It was at this time that Stere began writing.\n\nIn March 1889, the court decided to extend his term of exile by three more years, and relocated him to the village of Serginsk, near Minusinsk. He much later claimed that, while passing through the prison of Krasnoyarsk, he met Vladimir Lenin, the future Bolshevik leader — this is unlikely, as Lenin passed through the city several years after Stere. His other claim to have met and befriended Józef Piłsudski, future head of state of Poland (and, at the time, a prominent member of the Polish Socialist Party), was confirmed by Piłsudski himself in 1927 (Stere's novel, \"În preajma revoluției\", included Piłsudski as a character, under the name \"Stadnicki\").\n\nIn late 1891 or early 1892, having been set free, Stere returned to Bessarabia, and eventually sought political refuge inside Romania, crossing the border clandestinely. He studied Law at the University of Iași (under Petre Missir, while carrying on as a leftist activist and quickly becoming an influential figure among the youth of Iași, the inspiration behind a left-leaning student society that engaged in a virulent polemic with the nationalist youth, and an acquaintance of socialist leaders such as Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Garabet Ibrăileanu, Ioan Nădejde, Sofia Nădejde, Constantin Mille, Theodor Speranția, Vasile Morțun, and Nicolae L. Lupu. Later, a controversy erupted over Stere's academic credentials, as it was never consistently proven that he had passed his baccalaureate between being arrested and applying for law school.\n\nStere's break with Marxism led him to attempt persuading the newly created Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR) to amend its proletariat-focused policies, and, in 1893, to found the student society \"Datoria\" (\"The Duty\"), which preserved the Narodnik focus on educating peasants. He and his followers nevertheless continued to rely much of their thesis on Marxist concepts, coupled with an interest taken in the reformist socialist way advocated by Eduard Bernstein.\n\nAfter debuting as a journalist for the liberal-inspired \"Evenimentul\" in 1893 (and engaging in public debates with the socialist press), Stere also sent substantial contribution to \"Adevărul\", a tribune of various left-wing trends that was being published in Bucharest under the direction of Anton Bacalbașa. Later in 1893, he took part in founding \"Evenimentul Literar\", the literary supplement of \"Evenimentul\".\n\nHe joined in the socialists Bacalbașa and Ibrăileanu in a cultural polemic with the poet Alexandru Vlahuță and his magazine \"Vieața\". Vlahuță, who had sided with Dobrogeanu-Gherea during the latter's conflict with Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, nonetheless clashed with the leftists over the issue of \"art for art's sake\", arguing that the interest his adversaries took in didacticism was harming literature. This exchange of replies soon involved the former socialist Eduard Dioghenide, who attacked \"Evenimentul Literar\" with Antisemitic language, contending that Stere was \"an employee of the little kikes\" and had \"lost his soul to the Jews\". At the time, Stere's activity with \"Datoria\" also came under attack from various student societies — most of them associates of the Conservative Party.\n\nDuring the late 1890s, he had begun making use of the \"Șărcăleanu\" alias in his polemic articles, which became a particular topic of dispute after his confrontation with Dioghenide (who first speculated that Stere was the author of \"Șărcăleanu\"'s articles). Dioghenide's supporters, editors of the newspaper \"Naționalul\", consequently pressured Stere to indicate who \"Șărcăleanu\" was (\"We wish to know him, does he wear sidelocks or is he a Judaisized Romanian?\"). Similar calls were voiced by \"Vieața\", who alleged that Stere himself was a Russian Jew.\n\nWinning the support of several Conservative politicians, Stere successfully applied for Romanian citizenship in February 1895, obtaining naturalization through a special law, as \"a Romanian from Bessarabia\".\n\nIn 1897, Stere obtained a licensure with a thesis on legal entity and individualism, one which drew criticism from the influential Conservative-inspired group \"Junimea\", on the assumption that it had been partly inspired by Marx. At the time, he also published an incomplete series of philosophical essays centered on the works of Wilhelm Wundt. After graduation, Stere, who was by then the father of four, lived for a while in Ploiești, and afterwards joined the Bar association in Iași as a practicing lawyer. During the period, he met and befriended the influential writer Ion Luca Caragiale.\n\nBy 1898, Stere, who had continued to acquire influence with Iași-based socialists, became involved in disputes over the future of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party (PSDMR) and Vasile Morțun's call for a merger with the National Liberal Party (PNL) — Morțun's camp, which also included Alexandru G. Radovici, became known in time as \"the generous ones\" (\"generoșii\"). According to Constantin Titel Petrescu, Stere, despite his own polemics with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, sided with the latter and against Morțun (\"Even Stere [...] declared himself against moving to the Liberals\"). Nevertheless, during merger talks between the \"generous ones\" and the left-wing of the National Liberals, Stere was approached by the latter's Ion I. C. Brătianu; Brătianu and Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu, who were gathering supporters at a time when the PNL cabinet of Dimitrie Sturdza looked set to lose the general elections of 1899 to a strong coalition of Conservatives and former Liberals such as Petre S. Aurelian, proposed to Stere that he become a city councilor in Iași, and he accepted. During the period, he split with \"Evenimentul\", as the paper became close to Liberal splinter groups and virulently criticized the contacts between the PNL and former PSDMR affiliates.\n\nEventually, Stere entered the PNL as a left-wing radical and populist, supporting an original tactic that blended a Narodnik focus on the peasantry with a weariness towards capitalism and industrialisation. This was the origin of \"Poporanism\", a theory expanded upon in his influential 1908 essay \"Poporanism sau social-democrație?\", \"Poporanism or Social democracy?\" (Stere coined the original term in 1894, viewing it the best translation of the word \"Narodnik\").\n\nIn essence, \"Poporanism\" ceased to view socialism as a goal in countries such as Romania. Stere noted that the group to be defined as industrial proletariat accounted for ca. 1% of the total number of taxpayers (around 1907), and argued instead for a \"peasant state\", which was to encourage and preserve small agricultural plots as the basis for economic development. Citing the example of Denmark (\"see Danish cooperative movement\"), he also proposed that cooperative industries were to be created in the rural sphere, and that initiative agriculture could also rely in cooperative farms:\n\"The essential role of peasant cooperatives resides in that they, while keeping the small-scale peasant holdings intact, award them the possibility to make use of all the advantages of large-scale production.\"\n\nDespite its name, Stere understood the \"peasant state\" not as an actual hegemony of the peasantry, but as an immediate move from the census suffrage in the Kingdom of Romania to a universal one, intended to accurately reflect the country's social realities (\"see 1866 Constitution of Romania\"). In an 1898 speech, he also stressed a loyalty for the King of Romania (Carol I at the time).\n\nStere notably rejected Karl Kautsky's support for capitalization in agriculture, arguing that it was neither necessary nor practical. He was not, however, opposed to modernization, and invested trust in the role of intellectuals as militants and activists, as well as building on Werner Sombart's theory that agrarian economies were facing new and special conditions (as opposed to those that bore the mark of the Industrial Revolution). Stere observed changes occurring in the developed world at the turn of the 19th century, and concluded that industrialization of backward countries was also being blocked by colonialism and the prosperity it had brought to the British Empire and the United States. He argued that a new form of capital was being created at a larger, non-national, scale; he deemed it \"vagabond capital\", and viewed in it the source for the lack of accuracy in Marxist predictions over proletarian alienation (as it appeared that, in developed countries, the proletariat was growing wealthier).\n\nThis was also the start of a polemic between him and the Marxist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Although the two shared skepticism over the possibility of early socialist success in Romania (agreeing with Titu Maiorescu's verdict that it was one of the \"forms without substance\", and thus an ill-suited effect of Westernization), Dobrogeanu-Gherea argued that Stere's program of basing Romania's economy on cooperatives and small-scale agricultural holdings could only lead to endemic underdevelopment.\n\nAs a city coucilor in 1899, Stere soon found himself in an unusual position after Minister of the Interior Mihail Pherekyde ordered a clampdown on the surviving PSDMR. This came after the Conservative opposition voiced allegations that socialist clubs in the countryside were inciting laborers to revolt (an accusation which threatened to decrease the popularity of the Dimitrie Sturdza cabinet). As all former PSDMR members in the PNL came under scrutiny, he was himself the target of attacks in Parliament, and notably criticized by the Constitutional Party's Titu Maiorescu for allegedly using his position to \"disturb the elementary order; [...] leading to the only place it could lead: peasant rebellion\".\n\nHe lost his position in March 1899, following Sturdza's fall from power over a scandal involving relations between Romanian and Austria-Hungary. Consequently, he welcomed the remaining \"generous ones\" inside the PNL as the PSDMR was dissolved (April 1899); those socialists who remained independent continued to consider Stere the main instigator of the move. At the time, he relied on what he interpreted as Ion I. C. Brătianu's promise that a PNL cabinet was going to enforce both universal suffrage and land reform, and hoped to exercise an influence on the party's Left. With Pherekyde, Petre Poni, Toma Stelian and Spiru Haret, Stere was soon involved in public protests against the successive Conservative cabinets of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino and Petre P. Carp — provoked by the Hallier Affair — involving a French firm which used its government connections to regain a public works contract in the port of Constanța, although it had failed to respect its obligations —, and the \"Law on spirits\" (or \"law on \"țuica\"\") — which established homebrewing tax, engendering violence in the countryside.\n\nFollowing a conflict between Cantacuzino and Carp, which caused the latter's cabinet to be invalidated with assistance from Conservative parliamentarians (February 1901) Sturdza returned to power triumphantly. In the 1901 suffrage, he was first elected to Chamber for the 3rd Electoral College in Iaşi. Stere largely owed his 1901 appointment as Deputy Professor at the University of Iași to his political connections: falling short of legal requirements, he asked Brătianu and Spiru Haret to make an exception in his case (in order to avoid breaking the law which prevented state employees from being elected deputies, he asked not to receive a salary for his first course). After he became a full Professor, his assistant at the department was Nicolae Daşcovici.\n\nStere sided with Brătianu and Vasile Lascăr in 1904, at a time when the two confronted Sturdza and resigned from their government offices, provoking the cabinet's fall (and Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino's reinstatement as Premier).\n\nIn his later years, Stere argued that he had foreseen Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War and the string of social problems Russia experienced, and that he had sent the General Staff of the Romanian Army a memorandum on the matter.\n\nSoon after the Russian Revolution of 1905, Stere and a group of his followers returned to Bessarabia in order to encourage local Romanian sentiment during elections for the State Duma and \"zemstvos\" — according to Stere, the group had the tacit approval of the Conservative government. In parallel, Stere represented the Chișinău \"zemstvo\" as a lawyer in a civil lawsuit. They arrived at a time of conflict, when Black Hundreds activity was gaining momentum and peasant pressures in the countryside were meeting with resistance from reactionary politicians such as Vladimir Purishkevich and Pavel Krushevan. Initially, Stere doubled as a correspondent for PNL French language newspapers, signing them as \"C. Șercăleano\".\n\nHe issued a magazine (\"Basarabia\") of which he was editor (together with Ion Inculeț, Teodor Inculeț, Ion Pelivan, Alexei Mateevici, and Pan Halippa), attempting to profit from the political gains in Russia by calling for both in-depth social reforms and decentralization; their influence waned after reactionary politicians made electoral gains and, as the new administration, confiscated most of the magazine's issues (leading to its bankruptcy in 1907). Stere himself first returned to Romania in early 1906, and immediately left on a trip to Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania, where he met with the poet and activist Octavian Goga in Sibiu, as well as with other prominent ethnic Romanians, becoming in time an unofficial envoy of the PNL in the region. His involvement in the \"zemstvo\" trial became the topic of a scandal, after the institution accused Stere of having failed to fulfill his obligations as a lawyer, and called on him to return the fees he had received.\n\nIn its first editorial (1906), \"Viața Românească\" (a magazine which Stere had planned during his return to Bessarabia) summarized the cultural guidelines of the \"Poporanist\" trend, ones which Stere had first theorized in 1899 articles for \"Evenimentul Literar\":\n\"A 'national' culture with specific characteristics will only be born when the large, truly Romanian, popular masses will partake in \"creating\" and \"assessing\" cultural values — literary language, literature, ways of living — and this will only be possible when, through \"culture\", \"enlarged political participation\" and \"economical uplifting\", the peasantry will be awarded a \"social\" value in proportion with its numerical, economical, moral and national values, when we shall be \"one\" people, when all the social classes shall be of \"the same\" people [...].\"\n\nStere distanced himself from the competing and equally peasant-focused trend of \"Sămănătorul\", which aimed to preserve the peasant way of life in front of modernization rather than enforce the peasant economy advocated by \"Poporanism\". He was notably involved in polemics with \"Sămănătorul\"'s Octavian Goga and Nicolae Iorga.\n\nAs he later admitted, he attempted to divert attention from the \"Șărcăleanu\" alias by making use of another one, \"P. Nicanor & Co.\" (used before and after him by various \" Viața Românească\" contributors to the magazine's closing column), and by writing an article in which he claimed Stere and Șărcăleanu were not one and the same, thus maintaining the relative ambiguity until the early 1930s.\n\nAlongside other followers of Brătianu (including Garabet Ibrăileanu), Stere began campaigning in favor of dismissing the Conservative cabinet of Premier Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino, at a time when the latter also faced Take Ionescu's dissidence. This coincided with the outbreak of the 1907 Peasants' Revolt, which managed to bring down the cabinet after Ionescu agreed to support the Dimitrie Sturdza's return to power, as a means to ensure a response to the troubles. Like many other \"generous ones\", Stere was integrated in the new administration, and became a prefect of Iași County; instead of calling in the Romanian Army to pacify the area, he interfered in landowner-peasant relations to ensure better conditions for the latter, thus causing alarm in the Conservative camp. Although no violent reprisal against the rebels was recorded in his prefecture, his association with the repressive cabinet was the topic of criticism from many of his former allies, most notably Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Paul Bujor, and Constantin Mille. Together with his deputy prefect Gheorghe Gh. Mârzescu, Stere resigned his position in April and was replaced with Gheorghe Kernbach, preparing to run in the legislative election of that year — for the 2nd Electoral College in Iași; he won the seat in late May.\n\nIn early June, Premier Sturdza appointed Stere, alongside Take Ionescu, Petre P. Carp, Ion G. Duca, Alexandru Djuvara, Constantin Alimănișteanu, Ion and Alexandru G. Radovici, Dinu and Vintilă Brătianu, and 24 other parliamentarians, to a Committee charged with settling the agricultural issue; ultimately dissolved later in the same month, the Committee did not achieve any clear result, and Stere's radical proposals were repeatedly ignored by his own party. During the same period, a conflict erupted between Stere and the independent Antisemitic politician A. C. Cuza, who had been one of his opponents in the election; after making use of the word \"trivial\" in reference to Stere's attitudes, Cuza was sued by the latter, and refused a challenge to face him in a duel (an additional aspect of the scandal was the accusation that Stere had purposely failed students who supported Cuza's policies). Following the creation of Take Ionescu's Conservative-Democratic Party (PCD), the PNL launched accusations that the new group was financed by the leaseholder Mochi Fischer (whose property in Flămânzi had seen the outbreak of the 1907 revolt); in reaction, the PCD newspaper \"Opinia\", representing the views of Alexandru Bădărău, accused Stere of having failed to protect the interests of his clients in the Bessarabian \"zemstvo\" — Stere challenged the article's author Gheorghe Lascăr, former mayor of Iași, to a duel on Copou Hill, during which Lascăr was defeated and injured (March 11, 1908).\n\nCalling for an amnesty in respect to peasant rebels, Stere was initially silent on the new legislation (which, without questioning traditional landed property, allowed room for communal ownership), and was mostly absent from Chamber sessions. He nevertheless authored several studies in which he condemned the state of affairs in Romanian agriculture, concluding one of them with a Latin verdict, paraphrasing Pliny the Elder, \"Latifundia perdidere Romaniam\" (\"The great estates have ruined Romania\"). He expressed full support for the newly established agricultural bank, Casa Rurală, at a time when the project for its creation was voted in Parliament (February 1908).\n\nAfter again siding with Brătianu during the inner-party conflict with Sturdza — culminating in Brătianu's arrival to power after the premier fell victim to a nervous disease —, Stere replaced Petre Poni at the head of the Liberal club in Iași (June 1908), and soon came to be opposed by Mârzescu over his promotion of former socialists to party offices. Following the PCD's rise to the detriment of the PNL, Stere was able to enlist his party's support for his vision of electoral reform (with a single electoral college, and idea also promoted by Take Ionescu), and reported on it in Parliament, being criticized by the Conservative opposition on the basis of suspicions that he was still promoting socialist ideals. By mid-1909, he was the target of a campaign in \"Evenimentul\", which had by then turned Conservative, being again accused of having profited from the \"zemstvo\" in Bessarabia without providing the required services.\n\nAt the time, Stere and Ibrăileanu began mentioning the \"Poporanist\" or \"democratic peasantist\" trend as a small but representative faction of the PNL. Such attitudes caused further tensions inside his party: Henri Sanielevici, himself a former socialist National Liberal, commented that \"[Stere] seeks to strengthen himself \"through\" and inside the Liberal Party and break with it only when he will become strong enough\"; at a time when Brătianu was thought to be considering Stere for a cabinet position, the right-wing section of the PNL expressed its opposition and took steps to marginalize him (a catalysis for this attitude was the clash between the PNL and \"România Muncitoare\" affiliates, caused by the expulsion of the socialist activist Christian Rakovsky, together with promises made by Brătianu that his party would not push for land reform and universal suffrage). Largely absent from the political scene during 1909-1910, Constantin Stere nevertheless aided the PNL, fallen from power in December 1910, to reach an agreement with the Conservative-Democrats over opposition to the Petre P. Carp cabinet, by improving his relations with Alexandru Bădărău.\n\nIn his 1910 \"Neo-Serfdom (A Social and Economic Study of Our Land Issue)\", Dobrogeanu-Gherea viewed the relation between left-leaning cultural circles in Romania and Stere's Narodnik focus as conjectural, and made mention of competing trends inside \"Poporanism\":\n\"[There is] the \"Poporanism\" established in this country around 15 years after [the Narodnik original] and from the very same source. Lacking the rigorous method of Marxism, [...] \"Poporanism\" appears to have being against Social Democracy as its sole attribute [...].<br>[There is also] our national, Romanian, \"Poporanism\", as it has originated from the different and real circumstances of our country. [It] is more practical than theoretical, and does not in fact have its own theory. Mr. Stere's effort to award it one was not at all successful. But this \"Poporanism\" has its own views and attitudes and — what's more important — its own praxis. And to this real praxis, influencing the real course of things in this country, all kinds of \"Poporanists\" have associated themselves in one way or another, including those who are under the influence of Russian [Narodnik ideas]. But even this national \"Poporanism\" is far, very far from being uniform. This can even be seen in those multiple groupings composing it, [...] which many times quarrel with one another.\"\n\nThe apparent heterogeneous character of \"Poporanism\" was also criticized by others, who noted that its discourse also featured nationalist rhetoric. Nevertheless, PSDMR members other than Dobrogeanu-Gherea tended to refer to \"Viața Românească\" as \"engaged in Sterist politics\". Constantin Stere had a moderate reaction to the publishing of \"Neo-Serfdom\", briefly criticizing the arguments it brought against \"Poporanist\" politics (with Dobrogeanu-Gherea's renewed message that socialism was possible in backward countries); additional replies to the thesis came from Stere's disciple, the engineer Nicolae Profiri (among others who engaged in the debate was Dobrogeanu-Gherea's son, the future Leninist Alexandru Dobrogeanu-Gherea).\n\nAround 1912, while visiting Florence, Italy, Stere began a long extra-marital relationship with Ana Radovici, the widow of Ion Radovici (the latter had committed suicide in 1909). No longer elected to the Chamber in the 1912 suffrage, he returned to his chair at the Iași University. During the electoral campaign, reelected leader of the Liberal club, he was again attacked by \"Evenimentul\", and, having taken part in denouncing A. C. Cuza for plagiarism, clashed with his supporters (who briefly occupied the PNL headquarters in Iași in May).\n\nIn 1916, Stere strongly supported Romania's alliance with the Central Powers, arguing in favor of a policy focused on Bessarabia's recovery and against what he saw as Russian expansionism - ultimately, this led him to split with the pro-Entente PNL upon the outbreak of World War I. The socialist Ioan Nădejde commented on the fact that Stere had become rivals with members of the Romanian Social Democratic Workers' Party who had joined the PNL in 1899, and especially with their leader Vasile Morțun. He joined his voice to a diverse intellectual opposition which also included the Conservative Party's Petre P. Carp and Alexandru Marghiloman, the left-leaning writers Tudor Arghezi, Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, and Gala Galaction, as well as the revolutionary socialist Christian Rakovsky.\n\nFollowing the occupation of Bucharest by the Central Powers, Stere remained in the city, in contrast with the mass the Bucharesters who followed the Romanian authorities' refuge to Iași. With financial support from Alexandru Vaida-Voevod, he began publishing his \"Lumina\", a newspaper that was nevertheless, according to its editor, \"supportive of the Romanian point of view\" and thus subject to censorship (\"a German [censorship], for [views on] external politics [...] and for internal politics [the one] exercised by Petre P. Carp's men, who cut out my articles on expropriation [that is, land reform] and universal suffrage\").\n\nIn late March 1918, he represented the Alexandru Marghiloman government in Chișinău, during the time after the February and October Revolutions when Bessarabia had proclaimed itself a \"Moldavian Democratic Republic\" — he was charged with assisting Ion Inculeț in proposing a union of Bessarabia and Romania in \"Sfatul Țării\", the republic's legislative assembly. After prolonged debates, the vote was carried in favor of union on March 27 (\"see Greater Romania\").\n\nWith the change in fortunes brought by the Armistice with Germany, Stere was charged with treason and imprisoned; never facing trial, he was eventually set free.\n\nIn the late 1910s, he became discreetly involved in the movement that led to the creation of the \"Bessarabian Peasants' Party\" (founded and led by Pan Halippa and Ion Inculeț). In late 1918, most of it merged into Ion Mihalache's Peasants' Party (PȚ), of which he and Halippa became high-ranking members (Inculeț disagreed with the political union, and led a smaller party that eventually merged into the PNL).\n\nStere caused a scandal after running and winning elections for the Chamber of Deputies of Romania in Soroca (1921, under the Alexandru Averescu government), when all parties joined Nicolae Iorga in opposition to his appointment in office (Iorga considered Stere's anti-Entente past to be equivalent with treason). Fears of Bolshevik appeal in Bessarabia led to widespread allegations that the former socialist Stere was \"Bolshevizing\" the region. Speaking from the non-communist Left, Ioan Nădejde expressed concerns that Stere was radicalizing his message:\n\"[...] Stere aims to scrape together a socialist party, allied with the Peasants' Party, against all other social classes, and thus follows a policy out of which, in the end, we could only get Bolshevism.\"\n\nIn 1919, Stere had shown his awareness of that he and his party were being criticised by various political groups claiming Marxist orthodoxy, far left included. Stating again his belief in the fragile and minority position of industrial proletarians in the landscape of Romanian economy of the period, he indicated that the latter class was destined to adapt its demands to the interests of the peasantry:\n\"[...] for a country such as Romania, it is obvious that the urban working class' fate is literally in the hands of the rural working class. [...]<br>In these conditions, would it not be an act of suicide from the industrial working class of Romania if it were to adopt a hostile attitude toward the peasantry?<br>And: it is obvious that, no matter what the political and social doctrine preached by the urban proletariat, it would become hostile toward the peasantry if it wanted to impose upon it a form of economic structuring rejected by the peasantry, such as, for one, the immediate and violent socialization of peasant agriculture.<br>A socialist worker expresses, in the pages of [a socialist journal], the fear that the Peasants' Party of Romania will follow the example of the peasant parties in Bulgaria and Serbia [that is, the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union and the Serbian Peasant Party], who, once in power, are said to have oppressed the workers.<br>But can this serve as an argument against the solidarity in interests of the workers in villages and cities?<br>In these murky times, we have also assisted to the spectacle of bloody repression, by a socialist government [formed by the Social Democratic Party of Germany], of the workers' movements in Germany.<br>Does this mean that there is a real conflict of interests between those elements of the German proletariat that are being led by the orthodox Social Democracy, and the elements that follow the banner of the Independent Party?\"\n\nStere's position in his party's leadership prevented it from entering a close union with the Transylvania-based Romanian National Party (PNR) in 1924, as the PNR's leaders resented his anti-Entente past.\n\nTwo years later, however, he was admitted as one of the leaders of the newly created National Peasants' Party, a fusion of the two groups that was partly aided by the attack of National Liberal agents on Pan Halippa and the government's refusal to punish the guilty. Stere was the author of a legislation which aimed at providing for a degree of administrative decentralization and local initiative in government, passed in 1929 by the Iuliu Maniu executive.\n\nHe soon clashed with the more conservative politicians who had been members of the PNR. In March 1930, the mention of his name during a public celebration provoked a number of Romanian Army generals to leave in protest; immediately after, the National Liberal group around Vintilă Brătianu began attacking Stere's party for harbouring him, and for causing a split between Army and political establishment. General Henry Cihoschi, the Minister of Defense, was publicly criticized in parliament for not siding with his subordinates, and had to resign on April 4; Maniu appeared to support Stere's ousting.\n\nIn reply, Stere again expressed his view that Romania's government had been wrong in 1916, and left to create the minor Democratic Peasants' Party–Stere (not to be confused with the one created later by Nicolae L. Lupu), which he led into a union with Grigore Iunian's \"Radical Peasants' Party\".\n\nDespite his dissidence, Stere's ideas remained highly influential inside the National Peasants' Party, and constituted a major influence on the doctrines of Virgil Madgearu. \"Poporanism\", alongside Marxism itself, was a contributing factor in Dimitrie Gusti's original theories on sociology.\n\nStere's original ideas on economic development and Marxist topics were subject to censorship in Communist Romania; although works on him were published after the establishment of Nicolae Ceaușescu's rule, they generally avoided presenting and quoting his writings. Described as a \"reactionary\" until the 1960s, he was considered by revised official historiography to have taken a \"radical-bourgeoisie position\". In 2010, the Romanian Academy granted posthumous membership to Constantin Stere.\n\n\"În preajma revoluției\" first appeared in eight volumes between 1932 and 1936, when it met with popular and critical success, although this was largely due to the fact that its author was cloaked in legend. The Communist regime banned the work for its duration, considering it unpublishable, even after Ceaușescu steered a course away from Soviet tutelage. The book was published between 1990 and 1991 at Chișinău, while Stere's biographer Zigu Ornea put out another edition in 1991-1993. Both editions of the somewhat problematic 2331-page text were flawed, and in 2010, the Iași-based literary historian Victor Durnea began publishing a critical, annotated edition of Stere's works, starting with the novel. The manuscripts no longer exist, Stere's archive in his country house at Bucov having mysteriously disappeared after World War II, so that Durnea's interventions were limited to introducing uniformity into the available text, eliminating arbitrary decisions both by Stere and his editors, and replacing obsolete terms and punctuation that resulted from the author's culturally Russian outlook.\n\n"}

For example, data produced during human subject research might be de-identified to preserve research participants' privacy. \n\nWhen applied to metadata or general data about identification, the process is also known as data anonymization. Common strategies include deleting or masking personal identifiers, such as name and social security number, and suppressing or generalizing quasi-identifiers, such as date of birth and zip code. The reverse process of using de-identified data to identify individuals is known as \"re-identification\". Successful re-identifications cast doubt on de-identification's effectiveness. A systematic review of fourteen distinct re-identification attacks found \"a high re-identification rate […] dominated by small-scale studies on data that was not de-identified according to existing standards.\"\n\nDe-identification is adopted as one of the main approaches of data privacy protection. It is commonly used in fields of communications, multimedia, biometrics, big data, cloud computing, data mining, internet, social networks and audio–video surveillance.\n\nIn May 2014, the United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology found de-identification \"somewhat useful as an added safeguard\" but not \"a useful basis for policy\" as \"it is not robust against near‐term future re‐identification methods\".\n\nA survey is conducted, such as a census, to collect information about a group of people. To encourage participation and to protect the privacy of survey respondents, the researchers attempt to design the survey in such a way that people can participate in the survey and when the result is published it will not be possible to match any participant's individual response with any data published in the result.\n\nA online shopping website wants to know its users' preferences and shopping habits. It decides to retrieve customers' data from its database and do analysis on them. The personal data information including personal identifiers were collected directly when customers created their accounts. The website needs to pre-handle the data by de-identification techniques before analyzing data records to avoid violating customers' privacy. \n\nAnonymization refers to irreversibly severing a data set from the identity of the data contributor in a study to prevent any future re-identification, even by the study organizers under any condition. De-identification is also a severing of a data set from the identity of the data contributor, but may include preserving identifying information which can only be re-linked by a trusted party in certain situations. There is a debate in the technology community of whether data that can be re-linked, even by a trusted party, should ever be considered de-identified.\n\nCommon strategies of de-identification are masking personal identifiers and generalizing quasi-identifiers. Pseudonymization is the main technique used to mask personal identifiers from data records and k-anonymization is usually adopted for generalizing quasi-identifiers.\n\nPseudonymization is performed by replacing real names with a temporary ID, it deletes or masks personal identifiers to make individuals unidentified. This method makes it possible to track the individual's record over time even though the record will be updated. However, it can not prevent the individual from being identified if some specific combinations of attributes in data record indirectly identify the individual. \n\nk-anonymization defines attributes that indirectly points to the individual's identity as quasi-identifiers(QIs) and deal with data by making at least k individuals have same combination of QI values. QI values are handled following specific standards. For example, the k-anonymization replaces some original data in the records with new range values and keep some values unchanged. New combination of QI values prevents the individual from being identified and also avoid destroying data records.  \n\nResearch into de-identification is driven mostly for protecting health information. Some libraries have adopted methods used in the healthcare industry to preserve their readers' privacy.\n\nIn big data, de-identification is widely adopted by individuals and organizations. With the development of social media, e-commerce, and big data, de-identification is required and used for data privacy when users' personal data are collected by companies or third-party organizations who will analyze it for their own personal usage. Social network sites collect and save their users' data for analysis of user behavior. They adopt this approach to protect their users' privacy. Those online shopping websites adopt this method as well.\n\nWhenever a person participates in genetics research the donation of a biological specimen often results in the creation of a large amount of personalized data. Such data is uniquely difficult to de-identify.\n\nAnonymization of genetic data is particularly difficult because of the huge amount of genotypic\ninformation in biospecimens, the ties that specimens often have to medical history, and the advent of modern bioinformatics tools for data mining. There have been demonstrations that data for individuals in aggregate collections of genotypic data sets can be tied to the identities of the specimen donors.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that it is not reasonable to ever promise participants in genetics research that they can retain their anonymity, but instead such participants should be taught the limits of using coded identifiers in a de-identification process.\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule provides mechanisms for using and disclosing health data responsibly without the need for patient consent. These mechanisms center on two HIPAA de-identification standards – Safe Harbor and the Expert Determination Method. Safe Harbor relies on the removal of specific patient identifiers (e.g. name, phone number, email address, etc.) while the Expert Determination Method requires knowledge and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods to render information not individually identifiable.\n\nThe safe harbor method uses a list approach to de-identification and has two requirements:\n\n\nExpert Determination takes a risk-based approach to de-identification that applies current standards and best practices from the research to determine the likelihood that a person could be identified from their protected health information. This method requires that a person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles and methods render the information not individually identifiable. It requires:\n\nThe key law about research in electronic health record data is HIPAA Privacy Rule.

{"id": "14728186", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14728186", "title": "Epistemological anarchism", "text": "Epistemological anarchism\n\nEpistemological anarchism is an epistemological theory advanced by Austrian philosopher of science Paul Feyerabend which holds that there are no useful and exception-free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge. It holds that the idea of the operation of science by fixed, universal rules is unrealistic, pernicious, and detrimental to science itself.\n\nThe use of the term anarchism in the name reflected the methodological pluralism prescription of the theory, as the purported scientific method does not have a monopoly on truth or useful results. Feyerabend once famously said that because there is no fixed scientific method, it is best to have an \"anything goes\" attitude toward methodologies. Feyerabend felt that science started as a liberating movement, but over time it had become increasingly dogmatic and rigid, and therefore had become increasingly an ideology and despite its successes science had started to attain some oppressive features and it was not possible to come up with an unambiguous way to distinguish science from religion, magic, or mythology. He felt the exclusive dominance of science as a means of directing society was authoritarian and ungrounded. Promulgation of the theory earned Feyerabend the title of \"the worst enemy of science\" from his detractors.\n\nThe theory draws on the observation that there is no identifiable fixed scientific method that is consistent with the practices of the paradigm of scientific progress – the scientific revolution. It is a radical critique of rationalist and empiricist historiography which tend to represent the heroes of the scientific revolution as scrupulous researchers reliant on empirical research, whereas Feyerabend countered that Galileo, for example, relied on rhetoric, propaganda and epistemological tricks to support his doctrine of heliocentrism and that aesthetic criteria, personal whims and social factors were far more prevalent than the dominant historiographies allowed.\n\nScientific laws such as those posited by Aristotelian or Newtonian physics that assumed the stance of objective models of the universe have been found to come short in describing the entirety of the universe. The movement of universal models from Aristotelian to Newtonian physics to Einstein's relativity theory, where each preceding theory has been refuted as entirely universal model of reality, illustrates for the epistemological anarchist that scientific theories do not correspond to truth, as they are in part cultural manifestations, and ergo not objective. Feyerabend drew a comparison between one scientific paradigm triumphing over or superseding another, in the same manner a given myth is adapted and appropriated by a new, triumphant successor myth in comparative mythology. Feyerabend contended, with Imre Lakatos, that the demarcation problem of distinguishing on objective grounds science from pseudoscience was irresolvable and thus fatal to the notion of science run according to fixed, universal rules.\n\nFeyerabend also notes that science's success is not solely due to its own methods, but also to its having taken in knowledge from unscientific sources. In turn the notion that there is no knowledge outside science is a 'convenient fairy-tale' held only by dogmatists who distort history for the convenience of scientific institutions. For instance, Copernicus was heavily influenced by Pythagoras, whose view of the world had previously been rejected as mystical and irrational. Hermetic writings played an important role in the works of Copernicus as well as Newton. There exists fairly accurate astronomical knowledge that reaches back even to the Stone Age, measured in stone observatories in England and the South Pacific. Pre-Modern inventions such as crop rotation, hybrid plants, chemical inventions and architectural achievements not yet understood like that of the pyramids are all examples which threaten the notion that science is the only means of attaining knowledge.\n\nFeyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts, particularly the notions of Uniformity of Law and of Uniformity of Process across time and space. \"We have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist,\" said Feyerabend; \"we have theories that work in restricted regions, we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula, we have lots of unfounded claims (such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics), phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed; in physics, which many scientists regard as the one really basic science, we have now at least three different points of view...without a promise of conceptual (and not only formal) unification\".\n\nFurthermore, Feyerabend held that deciding between competing scientific accounts was complicated by the incommensurability of scientific theories. Incommensurability means that scientific theories cannot be reconciled or synthesized because the interpretation and practice of science is always informed by theoretical assumptions, which leads to proponents of competing theories using different terms, engaged in different language-games and thus talking past each other. This for Feyerabend was another reason why the idea of science as proceeding according to universal, fixed laws was both historically inaccurate and prescriptively useless.\n\nTerence McKenna was a fan of philosophers such as Feyerabend and Thomas Kuhn.\n\nIan Hacking was a friend of Feyerabend's, and they corresponded with and cited each other. He wrote the introduction and praised the last edition of \"Against Method\", quoting French philosopher Jean Largeault, who called it \"more than a book: it is an event\".\n\nImre Lakatos was also a friend of Feyerabend's. The two wrote letters to each other on the philosophy of science which would have been published in a book called \"For and Against Method\", but the death of Lakatos ended their plans to produce this dialogue volume. While Lakatos never publicly labeled himself so, Feyerabend contended that he was a fellow epistemological anarchist. Lakatos was the one who suggested and encouraged that Feyerabend write a book based on his philosophy and the lectures he gave in his classes, which turned out to be his seminal work \"Against Method\".\n\n"}

Laruelle has been publishing since the early 1970s and now has around twenty book-length titles to his name. Alumnus of the École Normale Supérieure, Laruelle is notable for developing a science of philosophy that he calls \"non-philosophy\". He currently directs an international organisation dedicated to furthering the cause of non-philosophy, the Organisation Non-Philosophique Internationale.\n\nLaruelle divides his work into five periods: Philosophy I (1971–1981), Philosophy II (1981–1995), Philosophy III (1995–2002), Philosophy IV (2002–2008), and Philosophy V (2008–present). The work comprising Philosophy I finds Laruelle attempting to subvert concepts found in Nietzsche, Heidegger, Deleuze and Derrida. Even at this early stage one can identify Laruelle's interest in adopting a transcendental stance \"towards\" philosophy. With Philosophy II, Laruelle makes a determined effort to develop a transcendental approach to philosophy itself. However, it is not until Philosophy III that Laruelle claims to have started the work of non-philosophy.\n\nLaruelle claims that all forms of philosophy (from ancient philosophy to analytic philosophy to deconstruction and so on) are structured around a prior decision, but that all forms of philosophy remain constitutively blind to this decision. The 'decision' that Laruelle is concerned with here is the dialectical splitting of the world in order to grasp the world philosophically. Laruelle claims that the decisional structure of philosophy can only be grasped non-philosophically. In this sense, non-philosophy is a science of philosophy.\n\nA decade ago, he was described by Scottish philosopher Ray Brassier as \"the most important unknown philosopher working in Europe today\" and was described by Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari as \"engaged in one of the most interesting undertakings of contemporary philosophy.\" The first English-language reception of his work (Brassier's account of Laruelle in \"Radical Philosophy\" in 2003) has been followed with a slew of introductions from John Ó Maoilearca (Mullarkey), Anthony Paul Smith, Rocco Gangle, Katerina Kolozova, and Alexander Galloway, as well as Brassier's own subsequent book, \"Nihil Unbound\".

{"id": "12808020", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=12808020", "title": "Hashkafa", "text": "Hashkafa\n\nHashkafa (; lit. \"outlook\") is the Hebrew term for worldview and guiding philosophy, used almost exclusively within Orthodox Jewish communities. It is a perspective that Orthodox Jews adopt that defines many aspects of their lives. Although Orthodox communities prefer clinging to the mesorah (or Jewish tradition) more so than other Jewish denominations, they acknowledge that society has changed since the Revelation at Mount Sinai. Therefore, Hashkafa is necessary to contextualize religious observance.\n\nHashkafa works in conjunction with \"halakha\"—the codified list of laws and commandments derived from the Torah and the oral tradition—to direct and enrich the day-to-day life of observant Orthodox Jews. When a hashkafa is inconsistent with \"halakha\", it is inherently illegitimate. While \"halakha\" is a rigid legal system that generally doesn’t afford much variation in practice, hashkafa provides a more flexible framework and is often the source of major disagreement between different Orthodox groups. For example, Orthodox halakhic authorities—or Rabbis—prohibit listening to music with profane lyrics. However, there is disagreement about listening to \"kosher\" non-Jewish music, which is part of the broader hashkafic (i.e. relating to hashkafa) discussion about cultural integration. Modern Orthodox Jews will generally listen to such music, while Hasidic Jews will distance themselves from it.\n\nHashkafa plays a crucial role in how Orthodox Jews interact with the world around them and influences individual beliefs about secularity, gender roles, and modernity. It also guides many practical decisions: where to send children to school, what synagogue to attend, and what community to live in.\n\nAlthough the word hashkafa is not explicitly mentioned in the Torah, the idea of broad guiding philosophies certainly stems from it. The Torah lays the foundations for such a construct in Deuteronomy 6:18 (), where it says: \"And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord.\" Similarly, the Tanakh (or Hebrew Bible) mentions the phrase \"walking in His Ways\", in reference to God, eight times. These verses make no mention of any specific commandments like observing the Sabbath or celebrating Passover; rather, they command the more fundamental principles—or hashkafas—of doing what is right and emulating God's ways.\n\nLeviticus 19:2 () describes another non-specific, all-encompassing meta-principle, stating, \"Ye shall be holy.\" Once again, this verse does not mention a specific commandment; instead, it insists on leading a life centered around holiness. The prominent Jewish philosopher Nachmanides (Hebrew: ) argues that the reason the Torah writes in such broad strokes in the aforementioned cases is because it would be impossible for the Torah to legislate every possible circumstance for all times and places. Therefore, the Torah provided principles that can be used to judge specific and new situations in accordance with Torah Law.\n\nHashkafa is crucial because it contextualizes religiosity and makes Torah relevant intergenerationally. According to strict Torah law, drunkenness and gluttony are permissible, as long as the wine is kosher and the meat is ritually slaughtered. However, if one considers the foundational principle of acting in a manner that is holy, then gluttony and drunkenness are incongruous with the Torah.\n\nWith the rise of Jewish philosophy and great Jewish thinkers, various sects of Orthodox Judaism have developed throughout history, each with their distinct hashkafa. While certain meta-principles are present in all sects—primarily the ones precisely demarcated in the Torah and Talmud, others have been the subject of much disagreement, especially those that deal with pertinent and pressing issues. Despite the vast differences between Hasidism and Modern Orthodoxy, both are still considered legitimate. The idea that there can be more than one correct understanding is deeply rooted in Jewish texts. The most well known of such statements is from the Midrash—the collection of exegesis of Torah taught by Rabbinical Sages of the post-temple era—in Bamidbar Rabbah 13:15, which explains that there are \"seventy faces to Torah\". This perplexing statement is generally understood to mean that the nature of the Torah's truth is multifaceted. Similarly, the Babylonian Talmud states regarding a legal debate that \"these and these are the words of the living Lord\"; in other words, both opinions are valid. Because no single hashkafa is believed to have a monopoly on the truth, great amount of philosophical flexibility is provided to Jewish thinkers, which results in different—sometimes even contradictory—hashkafas.\n\nWho may develop a new hashkafa is a complicated question that has been debated for centuries. Hashkafa must always be consistent with halakha; therefore, generally the most prominent rabbinic scholars of their times have successfully implemented new hashkafas because they are experts in both Jewish law and philosophy. Novel hashkafas seem to develop during periods of change and instability, within the Jewish community and within the larger society.\n\nModern Orthodox is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that attempts to meld the secular, modern world with traditional Jewish values and the observance of Jewish law. Modern Orthodox Jews value studying secular knowledge and are culturally engaged in society. Modern Orthodoxy is often tied to Religious Zionism. Although not identical, these hashkafas share many of the same values like supporting the State of Israel.\n\nHaredi Judaism, also called Yeshivishe, Misnagid, or Litvishe, is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that rejects modern secular culture. This stream emerged in response to the Jewish assimilation and secularization during the Enlightenment era with hopes to decrease the influence of secular society on Judaism. In contrast to Modern Orthodox Jews who embrace the modern world, Haredim (i.e. followers of Haredi Judaism) follow a strict reading of Jewish law by segregating themselves from modern society.\n\nHasidic Judaism is a stream of Orthodox Judaism that focuses on spirituality and Jewish mysticism as a fundamental aspect of faith. It was founded in 18th-century Eastern Europe by Rabbi Israel Baal Shem Tov. Hasidic Jews often engage in spiritually uplifting activities such as singing and taking cleansing ritual baths. They are recognized by their unique black garb and sidelocks.\n\nOther hashkafas include Torah Umadda, Torah U’Parnasah, and Carlbachian.\n\nJudaism values secular knowledge and non-Jews who study it. The Talmud in Brachot 58a says that one who sees a non-Jewish scholar should make this blessing: \"Blessed be He who gave His wisdom to flesh and blood.\" However, the extent to which a Jew should immerse himself in secular knowledge is contentious. Some argue that the pursuit of secular knowledge complements and refines the understanding of Jewish religious knowledge. This is a fundamental principle of Torah U’Madda, an idea closely associated with Yeshiva University. Others view secular knowledge as a worthwhile endeavor as long as it serves a practical end, such as learning biology to become a physician.\n\nYet others vehemently oppose pursuing secular knowledge as they believe it is not valuable enough. Some even believe that secular knowledge is dangerous because it contains ideas that are antithetical to the Torah and can cause people to stray from their religious life. Evolution is one popular example.\n\nBecause Orthodox Judaism is so deeply entrenched in its tradition, the question of how to incorporate and adapt to modernity, in terms modern of culture and thought, lies at the center of disagreements between orthodox groups. Modern Orthodox Jews view their interactions with the world around them and the development of society as an integral part of their theology. They do not view modernity as a threat; they embrace it. Modern Orthodox Jews are likely to view themselves as citizens of the modern world. Great Jewish thinkers such as Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik sometimes integrated modern thought into their worldview. Hasidism is generally opposed to the idea of integrating modern ideas and culture into their well-established theological thought. Hasidic Jews usually do not wear modern clothing, while Modern Orthodox Jews find no objection to it, provided that the clothing is modest.\n\nThe appropriate role of women in Jewish life and society at large varies across the spectrum of hashkafas. Hashkafas that more readily incorporate modern thought into Jewish life, tend to believe in greater gender equality. However, they will not ignore the framework of Halacha and sacrifice adherence to Jewish tradition for this end.\n\nSome hashkafas do not address or value gender equality; consequently, distinct gender roles are magnified. Many women, especially within the Hasidic community, take pride in their unique role as homemakers, and make their family and children their main focus. Currently, there is much disagreement about the educational curriculum for women, particularly if the Talmud may be studied by women. With the exception of Modern Orthodoxy, the majority of hashkafas do not allow women to study Talmud.\n\nSince the emergence of the Zionist movement, many questions have arisen about the permissibility of an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel prior to the arrival of the Messiah. This issue is especially complicated because the Jewish homeland is governed by secular Jews who are not strictly orthodox. There are some who oppose the State of Israel in its entirety and reject its legitimacy. Religious Zionists and Modern Orthodox Jews view the State of Israel as the first step in the process of redemption. Modern day Israel is a particularly antagonistic subject because the line between hashkafa and halakha in this area is blurry. Certain hasidic groups believe that an autonomous Jewish state in the Land of Israel is forbidden by Jewish law, and label Zionists as heretics.\n\nFor many within the Orthodox Jewish world, self-identity stems from subscribing to a specific hashkafa; therefore, hashkafa plays a central role in the social life of observant Jews. Hashkafas create cultures that can be very different. In the United States, Modern Orthodox Jews cluster to form tight-knit communities and that have their own synagogues, high schools, and community centers. Hasidic Jews also tend to live amongst themselves because cross-cultural social integration is difficult. Jews of similar hashkafas prefer together because they share much in common.\n\nShidduchim, matching two people together for marriage, is heavily influenced by hashkafas. Jewish blogs are rife with posts about the marital compatibility of men and women who have different hashkafas. Dating websites, like JWed and JDate, require members to fill in a box about their hashkafa. People assume that if a husband and wife have similar hashafas, they will most likely have a happy marriage.\n\nAlthough superficial and cliché, the type of head covering that a man wears is believed to be an expression of the hashkafa he subscribes to. People who identify as Religious Zionists or Modern Orthodox often wear knitted, colored kippot (Hebrew plural of kippah). It is sometimes affectionately, and sometimes derogatorily, referred to as a \"srugie\" (i.e., \"knitted\" or \"crocheted\"). Men from more Yeshivishe or Haredi circles wear black, velvet ones. Many believe that kippot are self-conscious manifestations of a person's hashakfic orientation and social affiliation.\n\nThis superficial and often misguided habit to pigeonhole people based on head coverings has been criticized.\n\nTaken at its broadest and simplest definition, hashkafa is the overarching Torah principles that guide human action. In that sense of the word, the term Hashkafa is significant to almost all Jewish denominations who mutually associate with certain principles listed in the Torah, especially on a humanistic and philosophical level. One such example is the principle of \"tikkun olam\"—taken to mean fixing the world and making it a better place—which is a nonsectarian belief. Reform Jews, Conservative Jews, and Orthodox Jews all value and emphasize this principle, but each endeavor to fulfill this concept differently based upon their respective traditions. Reform Judaism focuses on social action within the larger global community, while certain Orthodox groups might reject such efforts as unnecessary. Nonetheless, the term hashkafa itself generally is used only within the Orthodox community and refers solely to their guiding philosophies.\n\n"}

However, Rebbe Nachman states that the ultimate goal is to free oneself of all negative traits that obstruct the spiritually-transforming non-dual realization of the \"Imperative Existent,\" which is the Divinity inherent in all being.\n\nAccording to Rebbe Nachman, the practice of self-secluded meditation and prayer was practiced by the forefathers of Judaism—Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov, Moshe, David, the prophets, and their students—as well as the Torah leaders of each generation.\n\nThe method involves talking to God in an intimate, informal manner while secluded in a private setting such as a closed room or a private outdoor setting. Rebbe Nachman taught that the best place for \"hitbodedut\" is in the forests or fields. \"When a person meditates in the fields, all the grasses join in his prayer and increase its effectiveness and power,\" he wrote. He also suggested practicing \"hitbodedut\" in the middle of the night, when the desires and lusts of this world are at rest, although doing it during the day is just as effective.\n\nDuring a session of \"hitbodedut\", the practitioner pours out his heart to God in his own language, describing all his thoughts, feelings, problems and frustrations. Nothing was viewed by Rebbe Nachman as being too mundane for discussion, including business dealings, conflicting desires and everyday interactions. Even the inability to properly articulate what one wishes to say is viewed as a legitimate subject to discuss with God. One should also use the opportunity to examine his behavior and motivations, correcting the flaws and errors of the past while seeking the proper path for the future.\n\nRebbe Nachman told his leading disciple, Reb Noson, that \"hitbodedut\" should be practiced in a simple, straightforward manner, as if he were conversing with a close friend. He also advised:\n\n\"It is very good to pour out your thoughts before God like a child pleading before his father. God calls us His children, as it is written (Deuteronomy 14:1), \"You are children to God.\" Therefore, it is good to express your thoughts and troubles to God like a child complaining and pestering his father.\"\n\n\"Hitbodedut\" also lends itself to certain silent meditation techniques. One is the \"silent scream,\" which Rebbe Nachman himself practiced. He described the silent scream as follows:\n\nYou can shout loudly in a \"small still voice\"… Anyone can do this. Just imagine the sound of such a scream in your mind. Depict the shout in your imagination exactly as it would sound. Keep this up until you are literally screaming with this soundless \"small still voice.\"\n\nThis is actually a scream and not mere imagination. Just as some vessels bring the sound from your lungs to your lips, others bring it to the brain. You can draw the sound through these nerves, literally bringing it into your head. When you do this, you are actually shouting inside your brain.\n\nAnother form of \"hitbodedut\" is called \"bitul\" (nullification), in which the practitioner meditates on God's presence to the exclusion of all other things, including himself.\n\n\"Hitbodedut\" is performed in one's mother tongue, in contrast to most other Jewish prayers that are recited in Hebrew. Rebbe Nachman did not intend for \"hitbodedut\" to take the place of the three daily prescribed Jewish services, but to supplement them. He recommended that his followers engage in \"hitbodedut\" for at least one hour each day. \n\nHitbodedut is a staple practice for all Breslover Hasidim. The practice has been much publicized throughout Israel and the Jewish diaspora as a unique form of Jewish meditation, and is practiced by some Jews who are not Breslover Hasidim.\n\n\n\nInformation, News, Outreach and Media\n\n"}

{"id": "1466175", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1466175", "title": "Insight", "text": "Insight\n\nInsight is the understanding of a specific cause and effect within a specific context. The term insight can have several related meanings:\n\nAn insight that manifests itself suddenly, such as understanding how to solve a difficult problem, is sometimes called by the German word \"Aha-Erlebnis\". The term was coined by the German psychologist and theoretical linguist Karl Bühler. It is also known as an epiphany, eureka moment or (for cross word solvers) the penny dropping moment (PDM). Sudden sickening realisations identifying a problem rather than solving it, so Uh-oh rather than Aha moments are further seen in negative insight. A further example of negative insight is chagrin which is annoyance at the obviousness of a solution missed up until the point of insight, an example of this being the Homer Simpson's D'oh!\n\nIn psychology, insight occurs when a solution to a problem presents itself quickly and without warning. It is the sudden discovery of the correct solution following incorrect attempts based on trial and error. Solutions via Insight have been proven to be more accurate than non-insight solutions.\n\nInsight was first studied by Gestalt Psychology, in the early part of the 20th century, during the search for an alternative to associationism and the associationistic view of learning. Some proposed potential mechanisms for insight include: suddenly seeing the problem in a new way, connecting the problem to another relevant problem/solution pair, releasing past experiences that are blocking the solution, or seeing problem in a larger, coherent context.\n\nGenerally, methodological approaches to the study of insight in the laboratory involve presenting participants with problems and puzzles that cannot be solved in a conventional or logical manner. Problems of insight commonly fall into three types.\n\nThe first type of problem forces participants to use objects in a way they are not accustomed to (thus, breaking their functional fixedness), like the \"Duncker candle problem\". In the \"Duncker candle problem\", individuals are given matches and a box of tacks and asked to find a way to attach a candle to the wall to light the room. The solution requires the participants to empty the box of tacks, set the candle inside the box, tack the box to the wall, and light the candle with the matches.\n\nThe second type of insight problem requires spatial ability to solve, like the \"Nine-dot Problem\". The famous \"Nine-dot problem\" requires participants to draw four lines, through nine dots, without picking their pencil up.\n\nThe third and final type of problem requires verbal ability to solve, like the Remote Associates Test (RAT). In the RAT, individuals must think of a word that connects three, seemingly unrelated, words. RAT are often used in experiments, because they can be solved both with and without insight.\n\nTwo clusters of problems, those solvable by insight and those not requiring insight to solve, have been observed. An individual’s cognitive flexibility, fluency, and vocabulary ability are predictive of performance on insight problems, but not on non-insight problems. In contrast, fluid intelligence is mildly predictive of performance on non-insight problems, but not on insight problems. More recent research suggests that rather than insight versus search, that the subjective feeling of insight varies, with some solutions experienced with a stronger feeling of Aha than others.\n\nPeople in a better mood are more likely to solve problems using insight. Research demonstrated that self-reported positive affect of participants uniquely increased insight before and during the solving of a problem, as indicated by differing brain activity patterns. People experiencing anxiety showed the opposite effect, and solved fewer problems by insight. Emotion can also be considered in terms of the insight experience and whether this is a positive Aha or negative Uh-oh moment.\n\nUsing a geometric and spatial insight problem, it was found that providing participants with breaks improved their performance as compared to participants who did not receive a break. However, the length of incubation between problems did not matter. Thus, participants' performance on insight problems improved just as much with a short break (4 minutes) as it did with a long break (12 minutes).\n\nResearch has shown sleep to help produce insight. Individuals were initially trained on insight problems. Following training, one group was tested on the insight problems after sleeping for eight hours at night, one group was tested after staying awake all night, and one group was tested after staying awake all day. Those that slept performed twice as well on the insight problems than those who stayed awake.\n\nDifferences in brain activation in the left and right hemisphere seem to be indicative of insight versus non-insight solutions. Using RAT’s that were either presented to the left or right visual field, it was shown that participants having solved the problem with insight were more likely to have been shown the RAT on the left visual field, indicating right hemisphere processing. This provides evidence that the right hemisphere plays a unique role in insight.\n\nfMRI and EEG scans of participants completing RAT's demonstrated unique brain activity corresponding to problems solved by insight. For one, there is high EEG activity in the alpha- and gamma-band about 300 milliseconds before participants indicated a solution to insight problems, but not to non-insight problems. Additionally, problems solved by insight corresponded to increased activity in the temporal lobes and mid-frontal cortex, while more activity in the posterior cortex corresponded to non-insight problems. The data suggests there is something different occurring in the brain when solving insight versus non-insight problems that happens right before the solving of the problem. This conclusion has been supported also by eye tracking data which shows an increased eye blink duration and frequency when people solve problems via Insight. \nThis latter result, paired with an eye pattern oriented to look away from sources of visual inputs ( such as looking at blank wall, or out the window at the sky )proves different attention involvement in Insight problem solving vs problem solving via anlaysis.\n\nIt was found that groups typically perform better on insight problems (in the form of rebus puzzles with either helpful or unhelpful clues) than individuals. Additionally, while incubation improves insight performance for individuals, it improves insight performance for groups even more. Thus, after a 15-minute break, individual performance improved for the rebus puzzles with unhelpful clues, and group performance improved for rebus puzzles with both unhelpful and helpful clues.\n\nPersonality and gender, as they relate to performance on insight problems, was studied using a variety of insight problems. It was found that participants who ranked lower on emotionality and higher on openness to experience performed better on insight problems. Men outperformed women on insight problems, and women outperformed men on non-insight problems.\n\nHigher intelligence (higher IQ) has also been found to be associated with better performance on insight problems. However, those of lower intelligence benefit more than those of higher intelligence from being provided with cues and hints for insight problems.\n\nA recent large-scale study in Australia suggests that insight may not be universally experienced, with almost 20% of respondents reporting that they had not experienced insight.\n\nIndividuals are poorer at predicting their own metacognition for insight problems, than for non-insight problems. Individuals were asked to indicate how \"hot\" or \"cold\" to a solution they felt. Generally, they were able to predict this fairly well for non-insight problems, but not for insight problems. This provides evidence for the suddenness involved during insight.\n\nRecently, insight was studied in a non-laboratory setting. Accounts of insight that have been reported in the media, such as in interviews, etc., were examined and coded. It was found that insights that occur in the field are typically reported to be associated with a sudden \"change in understanding\" and with \"seeing connections and contradictions\" in the problem. It was also found that insight in nature differed from insight in the laboratory. For example, insight in nature was often rather gradual, not sudden, and incubation was not as important. Other studies used online questionnaires to further explore insight outside of the laboratory, verifying the notion that insight often happens in situations such as in the shower, echoing the idea that creative ideas occur in situations where divergent thought is more likely, sometimes called the Three B's of Creativity, in Bed, on the Bus or in the Bath.\n\nStudies on primate cognition have provided evidence of what may be interpreted as insight in animals. In 1917, Wolfgang Köhler published his book \"The Mentality of Apes\", having studied primates on the island of Tenerife for six years. In one of his experiments, apes were presented with an insight problem that required the use of objects in new and original ways, in order to win a prize (usually, some kind of food). He observed that the animals would continuously fail to get the food, and this process occurred for quite some time; however, rather suddenly, they would purposefully use the object in the way needed to get the food, as if the realization had occurred out of nowhere. He interpreted this behavior as something resembling insight in apes. A more recent study suggested that elephants might also experience insight, showing that a young male elephant was able to identify and move a large cube under food that was out of reach so that he could stand on it to get the reward.\n\nThere are a number of theories representing insight; at present, no one theory dominates interpretation.\n\nAccording to the dual-process theory, there are two systems used to solve problems. The first involves logical and analytical thought processes based on reason, while the second involves intuitive and automatic processes based on experience. Research has demonstrated that insight probably involves both processes; however, the second process is more influential.\n\nAccording to the three-process theory, intelligence plays a large role in insight. Specifically, insight involves three different processes (selective encoding, combination, and comparison), which require intelligence to apply to problems. Selective encoding is the process of focusing attention on ideas relevant to a solution, while ignoring features that are irrelevant. Selective combination is the process of combining the information previously deemed relevant. Finally, selective comparison is the use of past experience with problems and solutions that are applicable to the current problem and solution.\n\nAccording to the four-stage model of insight, there are four stages to problem solving. First, the individual prepares to solve a problem. Second, the individual incubates on the problem, which encompasses trial-and-error, etc. Third, the insight occurs, and the solution is illuminated. Finally, the verification of the solution to the problem is experienced. Since this model was proposed, other similar models have been explored that contain two or three similar stages.\n\nIn psychology and psychiatry, insight can mean the ability to recognize one's own mental illness. Psychiatric insight is typically measured with the Beck cognitive insight scale This form of insight has multiple dimensions, such as recognizing the need for treatment, and recognizing consequences of one's behavior as stemming from an illness. A person with very poor recognition or acknowledgment is referred to as having \"poor insight\" or \"lack of insight\". The most extreme form is anosognosia, the total absence of insight into one's own mental illness. Many mental illnesses are associated with varying levels of insight. For example, people with obsessive compulsive disorder and various phobias tend to have relatively good insight that they have a problem and that their thoughts and/or actions are unreasonable, yet are compelled to carry out the thoughts and actions regardless. Patients with schizophrenia, and various psychotic conditions tend to have very poor awareness that anything is wrong with them. Psychiatric insight favourably predicts outcomes in cognitive behavioural therapy for psychosis. Today some psychiatrists recognize psychiatric medication may contribute to the patients lack of insight.\n\n\"Insight\" can also refer to other matters in psychology; problem solving behavior requiring insight is the subject of insight phenomenology.\n\nAn insight is the derivation of a rule which links cause with effect. The mind is a model of the universe built up from insights.\n\nThoughts of the mind fall into two categories: \nA mature mind has assimilated many insights and represents a sophisticated model of the universe. The mind-model might be inaccurate. When insight is not subordinate to a validation discipline like the 'scientific method', 'fallacious' thinking can result in a confused mind.\nIntuition, which is often described in the popular literature as an alternative thought process, is merely another manifestation of insight. In this process, multiple bits of seemingly unrelated data are linked together and a hypothesis or plan of action is generated. Usually this process is generated in a novel situation. Such a circumstance links data which had previously seemed unrelated. The categories and analytical process, however, are not distinct from any other form of insight. The only difference is the degree of novelty of the stimulus.\n\nThe Pali word for \"insight\" is \"vipassana\", which has been adopted as the name of a kind of Buddhist mindfulness meditation. Recent research indicates that mindfulness meditation does facilitate solving of insight problems with dosage of 20 minutes.\n\nPat Conroy points out that an insight is a statement based on a deep understanding of your target consumers' attitudes and beliefs, which connect at an emotional level with your consumer, provoking a clear response (\"This brand understands me! That is exactly how I feel! — even if they've never thought about it quite like that)\" which, when leveraged, has the power to change consumer behavior. Insights must effect a change in consumer behavior that benefits your brand, leading to the achievement of the marketing objective.\n\nInsights can be based on:\n\nInsights are most effective when they are/do one of the following:\n\nIn order to be actionable, as the expression of a consumer truth, an insight as to be stated as an articulated sentence, containing:\n\nThe gap between the second and the third term offers a tension, which constitutes a potential for a brand. Like there are concept writers for copies, there are insight writers.\n\nIn technical terminology of insight in market research is the understanding of local market by referring different source of information (such as quantitative research and qualitative research) proving for the consumers' insight.\n\n\n"}

She subsequently taught philosophy at Princeton University; philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities at the University of Waterloo; philosophy at the University of Western Ontario; philosophy, English, and creative writing at the University of New Brunswick; and philosophy at the University of Alberta.\n\nZwicky is Professor Emerita in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Victoria, where she taught both philosophy and interdisciplinary humanities courses from 1996 until 2009. She has served as a faculty member at the Banff Centre Writing Studio, has conducted numerous writing workshops, and has served as an editor for Brick Books since 1985. Since 2017 she has been the series editor of Oksana Poetry and Poetics, published by the University of Regina Press.\n\nHeraclitus, Plato, Freud, Simone Weil and Wittgenstein are the thinkers who figure most prominently in Zwicky's philosophical work, which challenges the hegemonic status of logico-linguistic analysis in 20th and 21st century Anglo-American philosophy. She is a realist who aims to defeat analytic skepticism by exploring the relationship between philosophical and poetic thinking, and by developing the notions of \"resonance\" and \"lyric\" understanding in ontology and epistemology:\n\n\"Lyric shares with the coherentists, pragmatists, and nihilists the view that foundationalism is intellectually bankrupt: that what analytic system cannot sustain is anything like the claim of naive realism. However, lyric shares with naive realism the view that skepticism is false. What it does not share is the view that it is demonstrably, within system, false.\" (\"Lyric Philosophy\" L264)\n\nHer books, \"Lyric Philosophy\" and \"Wisdom & Metaphor\", discuss but also enact this idea of resonance. They consist of many voices that range across diverse disciplines, so that Zwicky's aphoristic remarks on the left-hand pages are read with and against excerpts from the history of philosophy, musical scores, paintings, photographs, and poems on the right-hand pages. While Zwicky orders her remarks carefully and has a linear philosophical argument to make, each page is also designed to evoke remarks or images from other pages, prompting non-linear connections and directly demonstrating what she refers to as lyric structure, characterized by resonance.\n\nZwicky believes that Heraclitus, Plato, and Wittgenstein have purposefully constructed philosophical texts in this way before her. She cites Freud's distinction between primary and secondary processes, as well as Max Wertheimer's work in gestalt psychology, as support for the concepts she promotes. She references pieces of music, works of art, and natural eco-systems as objects that also exhibit lyric structure.\n\nZwicky presents logical analysis and lyric thinking as complementary and includes both in a broader, more total conception of reason. She believes that the Anglo-American notion of what constitutes good philosophy is excessively narrow, and criticizes Continental and poststructural views for their anti-realist vision of the world as nothing more than a projection of human thought and desire. Zwicky promotes balance, arguing that neglect of either logical or lyric thinking leads to our ontological, epistemological, ethical and environmental peril.\n\nDr. James O. Young, Professor of Philosophy at the University of Victoria has said: \"There’s a reasonable chance that people will be reading her work a century from now. This is something that one says about only a very small number of philosophers.\"\n\nZwicky's poetry is influenced by music in the classical European, blues, and jazz traditions. It also deals with the natural world, and has often been cited for its intense lyricism. Numerous individual poems have been translated into Czech, French, German, Serbian, Spanish and Italian.\n\nAmong her many accolades, both Zwicky's \"Songs for Relinquishing the Earth\" and \"Robinson's Crossing\" were shortlisted for Governor General's Awards for Poetry. \"Songs for Relinquishing the Earth\" won the award in 1999. \"Robinson’s Crossing\" won the Dorothy Livesay Poetry Prize in 2004.\n\nHer 2011 book, \"Forge\", was shortlisted for the 2012 Canadian Griffin Poetry Prize.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He is best known for his philosophical work on concepts such as the nature of inference, relations between conditions, argument-deduction-proof distinctions, the relationship between logic and epistemology, and the place of proof theory and model theory in logic. Nine of Corcoran's papers have been translated into Spanish, Portuguese, Persian, and Arabic; his 1989 \"signature\" essay was translated into three languages. Fourteen of his papers have been reprinted; one was reprinted twice.\n\nHis work on Aristotle’s logic of the \"Prior Analytics\" is regarded as being highly faithful both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It is the basis for many subsequent investigations.\n\nHis mathematical results on definitional equivalence of formal string theories, sciences of strings of characters over finite alphabets, are foundational for logic, formal linguistics, and computer science.\n\nCorcoran studied engineering at the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, with a degree in Advanced Curriculum Engineering in 1956, and at the Johns Hopkins University with a BES in Mechanical Engineering in 1959. After briefly working in engineering, he studied philosophy at the Johns Hopkins University where he obtained his PhD in philosophy in 1963. His post-doctoral studies in mathematics were at Yeshiva University in\n1964 and at the University of California Berkeley in 1965. His dissertation topic was Generative Structure of Two-valued Logics.\n\nCorcoran's first logic teacher was Albert Hammond. Corcoran studied Plato and Aristotle with Ludwig Edelstein. His next two logic teachers were Joseph Ullian and Richard Wiebe. Corcoran's dissertation supervisor was Robert McNaughton. At Yeshiva University in New York City Corcoran studied with Raymond Smullyan and Martin Davis. Corcoran's first tenure-track position was at the University of Pennsylvania, where his dissertation supervisor was a Professor of Computer and Information Science.\n\nHe has been Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo (SUNY), 1973–; Associate Professor of Philosophy, University at Buffalo, 1970–1973;\nAssistant Professor of Linguistics, University of Pennsylvania, 1965–1969; Member of\nLinguistics Group, IBM Research Center, 1963–1964.\n\nHe is or was Visiting Professor of Logic, University of\nSantiago de Compostela 1994; Visiting Scholar, Linguistic Institute, SUNY Oswego 1976; NSF\nSeminar Project Director, Linguistic Institute, University at Buffalo 1971; Visiting Associate\nProfessor of Philosophy and Research Associate, University of Michigan 1969–1970; Visiting\nLecturer in Philosophy, University of California, Berkeley 1964–1965; Mathematician, General Electric Research Laboratory 1962; Mathematician, Aeronca Astromechanics Institute, 1961; Junior\nInstructor in Philosophy, Johns Hopkins University 1960–1961.\n\nCorcoran's work in history of logic involves most of the discipline's\nproductive periods. He has discussed Aristotle, the Stoics, William of Ockham, Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri, George Boole, Richard Dedekind, Gottlob Frege, Charles Sanders Peirce, Clarence Irving Lewis, the American Postulate Theorists, Alfred Tarski, Willard Van Orman Quine, and Warren Goldfarb.\n\nHis 1972 interpretation of Aristotle's Prior Analytics, proposed independently by Timothy Smiley at about the same time, has been found to be more faithful than previous interpretations both to the Greek text and to the historical context. It has formed the basis for subsequent investigations by Edgar Andrade, George Boger, Manuel Correia, Paolo Crivelli, Newton da Costa, Catarina Dutilh, Paolo Fait, Nicolas Fillion, James Gasser, Klaus Glashoff, John Martin, Mary Mulhern, Michael Scanlan, Robin Smith, Neil Tennant, and others. It was adopted for the 1989 translation of the Prior Analytics by Robin Smith and for the 2009 translation of the Prior Analytics Book A by Gisela Striker.\n\nHis 1980 critical reconstruction of Boole's original 1847 system revealed previously unnoticed gaps and errors in Boole's work and established the essentially Aristotelian basis of Boole's philosophy of logic. A 2003 article provides a systematic comparison and critical evaluation of Aristotelian logic and Boolean logic; it also reveals the centrality of wholistic reference in Boole's philosophy of logic. According to Corcoran, Boole fully accepted and endorsed Aristotle's logic. Boole did not dispute one point that Aristotle made, but he did “go under, over, and beyond” Aristotle's logic by 1) providing it with mathematical foundations involving equations,2) extending the class of problems it could treat—to assessing validity he added solving equations--,and 3) expanding the range of applications it could handle—e.g. from propositions having only two terms to those having arbitrarily many.\n\nMore specifically, Boole agreed with what Aristotle said; Boole's ‘disagreements’, if they might be called that, concern what Aristotle did not say. \nFirst, in the realm of foundations, Boole reduced Aristotle's four propositional forms of to one form, that of equations—-by itself a revolutionary idea. \nSecond, in the realm of logic's problems, Boole's addition of equation solving to logic—-another revolutionary idea—-involved Boole's doctrine that Aristotle's rules of inference (the “perfect syllogisms”) must be supplemented by rules for equation solving. \nThird, in the realm of applications, Boole's system could handle multi-term propositions and arguments whereas Aristotle could handle only two-termed subject-predicate propositions and arguments. For example, Aristotle's system could not deduce “No quadrangle that is a square is a rectangle that is a rhombus” from “No square that is a quadrangle is a rhombus that is a rectangle” or from “No rhombus that is a rectangle is a square that is a quadrangle”.\nHis collaboration with Alfred Tarski in the late 1970s and early 1980s led to publications on Tarski's work and to the 2007 article \"Notes on the Founding of Logics and Metalogic: Aristotle, Boole, and Tarski,\" which traces Aristotelian and Boolean ideas in Tarski's work and which confirms Tarski's status as a founding figure in logic on a par with Aristotle and Boole.\n\nHis work in philosophy of logic focuses on the nature of logic, the role of logic in\ninquiry, the conceptual structure of logic, the metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions\nof logic, the nature of mathematical logic and the gaps between logical theory and mathematical\npractice. His mathematical logic treats propositional logics, modal logics, identity logics,\nsyllogistic logics, the logic of first-order variable-binding term operators, second-order logics,\nmodel theory, and the theory of strings – a discipline which is foundational in all areas of logic\nand which provides essential background for all of his other mathematical work. In philosophy of mathematics Corcoran has been guided by a nuanced and inclusionary Platonism which\nstrives to do justice to all aspects of mathematical and logical experience including those aspects\nemphasized by competing philosophical perspectives such as logicism, constructivism,\ndeductivism, and formalism. Although several of his philosophical papers presuppose little\nhistory or mathematics, his historical papers often involve either original philosophy (e.g. his\nrecent BSL article “Schemata”) or original mathematics (e.g. his 1980 HPL article\n“Categoricity”). He has referred to the mathematical dimension of his approach to history as\nmathematical archaeology. His philosophical papers often involve original historical research. He has been\nguided by the Aristotelian principle that the nature of modern thought is sometimes best\nunderstood in light of its historical development, a view that he attributes to Arthur Lovejoy’s\nHistory of Ideas Program at Johns Hopkins University and in which he has been encouraged by\nthe American philosopher and historian Peter Hare.\n\nMany of Corcoran’s articles and reviews are co-authored and many of his single-author\npublications acknowledge involvement of colleagues and students. Corcoran emphasizes the\nintensely and essentially personal nature of all genuine knowledge including logical knowledge.\nNevertheless, he also stresses the importance of communities of knowers and how much each person can\nbenefit in the personal search for truth from critical cooperation with other objective researchers. For over 40 years he was the leader of the “Buffalo Syllogistic Group”—a community of philosophers, historians, linguists, logicians, and mathematicians dedicated to the study of the origin of logic. The achievements of this community are sketched in his 2009 paper “Aristotle’s Logic at the University at Buffalo’s Department of Philosophy”, Ideas y Valores: Revista Colombiana de Filosofía 140 (August 2009) 99–117.\nA list of his publications, complete through 2000, appears in the 1999 volume of History and Philosophy of Logic, which also includes the expository article by M. Scanlan and S. Shapiro\n“The Work of John Corcoran: An Appreciation”. Other articles about his work include\n“Corcoran the Mathematician” by S. Shapiro, “Corcoran the Philosopher” by J. M. Sagüillo, and\n“Corcoran in Spanish” by C. Martínez-Vidal; all appear in a 2007 volume published by the\nUniversity of Santiago de Compostela Press.\nCorcoran's work in the 1990s on information-theoretic logic is discussed by José M. Sagüillo in the article “Methodological Practice and Complementary Concepts of Logical Consequence: Tarski's Model-Theoretic Consequence and Corcoran's Information-Theoretic Consequence” (History and Philosophy of Logic\nvolume 30, 2009, 21-48), which received the 2009 Ivor Grattan-Guinness Award for the History and Philosophy of Logic ( http://informaworld.com/thpl ).\n\nFor a complete list see John Corcoran's homepage.\nSome of his papers are available online: https://buffalo.academia.edu/JohnCorcoran\n\n\nCorcoran's courses are all introductory, having no prerequisites and presupposing no\nprevious knowledge. In each course he reconstructs its subject-matter from the ground up and never covers the same material twice. Stressing the priority of education over indoctrination and the superiority of learning how to think over learning what to think, he strives to assist his\nstudents in connecting with the reality logic is about so that they may become autonomous judges of the adequacy of the field.\n\nHis former students teach at the Autonomous University of Mexico City, Bryn Mawr, Canisius College, Colorado State, Dordt College, Franciscan University, Fredonia State, Ohio State, Oregon State, Pontifical University of Rio de Janeiro, St. John Fisher College, St. John's College, UCLA, University of Lausanne, University of Santiago de Compostela, and elsewhere.\n\nHis best-known students include George Boger, James Gasser, Calvin Jongsma, Idris Samawi Hamid, Edward Keenan,Timothy Madigan, Sriram Nambiar, José Miguel Sagüillo, Michael Scanlan, Stewart Shapiro, and George Weaver.\n\n\n"}

He was one of the leading representatives of the Warsaw School of Mathematics.\n\nKazimierz Kuratowski was born in Warsaw, Vistula Land (the part of the former Kingdom of Poland controlled by the Russian Empire), on 2 February 1896, into an assimilated Jewish family. He was a son of Marek Kuratow, a barrister, and Róża Karzewska. He completed a Warsaw secondary school, which was named after general Paweł Chrzanowski. In 1913, he enrolled in an engineering course at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, in part because he did not wish to study in Russian; instruction in Polish was prohibited. He completed only one year of study when the outbreak of World War I precluded any further enrollment. In 1915, Russian forces withdrew from Warsaw and Warsaw University was reopened with Polish as the language of instruction. Kuratowski restarted his university education there the same year, this time in mathematics. He obtained his Ph.D. in 1921, in newly independent Poland.\n\nIn autumn 1921 Kuratowski was awarded the Ph.D. degree for his groundbreaking work. His thesis statement consisted of two parts. One was devoted to an axiomatic construction of topology via the closure axioms. This first part (republished in a slightly modified form in 1922) has been cited in hundreds of scientific articles.\n\nThe second part of Kuratowski's thesis was devoted to continua irreducible between two points. This was the subject of a French doctoral thesis written by Zygmunt Janiszewski. Since Janiszewski was deceased, Kuratowski's supervisor was Wacław Sierpiński. Kuratowski's thesis solved certain problems in set theory raised by a Belgian mathematician, Charles-Jean Étienne Gustave Nicolas, Baron de la Vallée Poussin.\n\nTwo years later, in 1923, Kuratowski was appointed deputy professor of mathematics at Warsaw University. He was then appointed a full professor of mathematics at Lwów Polytechnic in Lwów, in 1927. He was the head of the Mathematics department there until 1933. Kuratowski was also dean of the department twice. In 1929, Kuratowski became a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society\n\nWhile Kuratowski associated with many of the scholars of the Lwów School of Mathematics, such as Stefan Banach and Stanislaw Ulam, and the circle of mathematicians based around the Scottish Café he kept close connections with Warsaw. Kuratowski left Lwów for Warsaw in 1934, before the famous Scottish Book was begun (in 1935), hence did not contribute any problems to it. He did however, collaborate closely with Banach in solving important problems in measure theory.\n\nIn 1934 he was appointed the professor at Warsaw University. A year later Kuratowski was nominated as the head of Mathematics Department there. From 1936 to 1939 he was secretary of the Mathematics Committee in The Council of Science and Applied Sciences.\n\nDuring World War II, he gave lectures at the underground university in Warsaw, since higher education for Poles was forbidden under German occupation.\n\nIn February 1945, Kuratowski started to lecture at the reopened Warsaw University. In 1945, he became a member of the Polish Academy of Learning, in 1946 he was appointed vice-president of the Mathematics department at Warsaw University, and from 1949 he was chosen to be the vice-president of Warsaw Scientific Society. In 1952 he became a member of the Polish Academy of Sciences, of which he was the vice-president from 1957 to 1968.\n\nAfter World War II, Kuratowski was actively involved in the rebuilding of scientific life in Poland. He helped to establish the State Mathematical Institute, which was incorporated into the Polish Academy of Sciences in 1952. From 1948 until 1967 Kuratowski was director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, and was also a long-time chairman of the Polish and International Mathematics Societies. He was president of the Scientific Council of the State Institute of Mathematics (1968–1980). From 1948 to 1980 he was the head of the topology section. One of his students was Andrzej Mostowski.\n\nKazimierz Kuratowski was one of a celebrated group of Polish mathematicians who would meet at Lwów's Scottish Café. He was a president of the Polish Mathematical Society (PTM) and a member of the Warsaw Scientific Society (TNW). What is more, he was chief editor in \"Fundamenta Mathematicae\", a series of publications in \"Polish Mathematical Society Annals\". Furthermore, Kuratowski worked as an editor in the Polish Academy of Sciences Bulletin. He was also one of the writers of the Mathematical monographs, which were created in cooperation with the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences (IMPAN). High quality research monographs of the representatives of Warsaw's and Lwów’s School of Mathematics, which concerned all areas of pure and applied mathematics, were published in these volumes.\n\nKazimierz Kuratowski was an active member of many scientific societies and foreign scientific academies, including the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Italy and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).\n\nIn 1981, IMPAN, the Polish Mathematical Society, and Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska established a prize in his name for achievements in mathematics to people under the age of 30 years. The prize is considered the most prestigious of awards for young Polish mathematicians; past recipients have included Józef H. Przytycki, Mariusz Lemańczyk, Tomasz Łuczak, Mikołaj Bojańczyk, and Wojciech Samotij.\n\nKuratowski’s research mainly focused on abstract topological and metric structures. He implemented the closure axioms (known in mathematical circles as the Kuratowski closure axioms). This was fundamental for the development of topological space theory and irreducible continuum theory between two points. The most valuable results, which were obtained by Kazimierz Kuratowski after the war are those that concern the relationship between topology and analytic functions (theory), and also research in the field of cutting Euclidean spaces. Together with Ulam, who was Kuratowski’s most talented student during the Lwów Period, he introduced the concept of so-called quasi homeomorphism that opened up a new field in topological studies.\nKuratowski’s research in the field of measure theory, including research with Banach, Tarski, was continued by many students. Moreover, with Alfred Tarski and Wacław Sierpiński he provided most of the theory concerning Polish spaces (that are indeed named after these mathematicians and their legacy). Knaster and Kuratowski brought a comprehensive and precise study to connected components theory. It was applied to issues such as cutting-plane, with the paradoxical examples of connected components.\n\nKuratowski proved the Kuratowski-Zorn lemma (often called just Zorn's lemma) in 1922. This result has important connections to many basic theorems. Zorn gave its application in 1935. Kuratowski implemented many concepts in set theory and topology. In many cases, Kuratowski established new terminology and symbolism.\nHis contributions to mathematics include:\n\nKuratowski’s post-war works were mainly focused on three strands:\n\nAmong over 170 published works are valuable monographs and books including Topologie (Vol. I, 1933, translated into English and Russian, and Vol. II, 1950) and Introduction to Set Theory and Topology (Vol. I, 1952, translated into English, French, Spanish, and Bulgarian). He authored \"A Half Century of Polish Mathematics 1920-1970: Remembrances and Reflections\" (1973) and \"Notes to his autobiography\" (1981). The latter was published posthumously thanks to Kuratowski's daughter Zofia Kuratowska, who prepared his notes for printing. Kazimierz Kuratowski represented Polish mathematics in the International Mathematics Union where he was vice president from 1963 to 1966. What is more, he participated in numerous international congresses and lectured at dozens of universities around the world. He was an honorary causa doctor at the Universities in Glasgow, Prague, Wroclaw, and Paris. He received the highest national awards, as well as a gold medal of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, and the Polish Academy of Science. Kuratowski died on 18 June 1980 in Warsaw.\n\n\n"}

The revolution is about a fundamental socioeconomic change from adding value by producing things which is, ultimately limited, to adding value by creating and using knowledge which can grow indefinitely.\n\nOverviews of the knowledge revolution were provided by Marilyn Ferguson, who refers to the ascendance of an irreversible shift in the global state of mind; a fundamentally new world view that encompasses insights from ancient times through current breakthrough science. Sakaiya indicates that three major disrupters of the established order – population shifts, resource supply, and technological developments are producing phenomena never before encountered in the industrial society. Brown states that the revolution will not flow from the mobilization of new machines; rather, it will require a fundamental revamp of the human context in which machines are used. Finally, Johnson observes that when such paradigm shifts occur only once every few centuries, one has to be a visionary to see beyond the limits of current forms.\n\nFrom a perspective of understanding this global societal sea change, Savage states that the shift is one of attitudes, values, and norms. It will only come through a struggle of thought because many of the changes are counterintuitive from a traditional point of view and they are difficult to conceptualize with industrial era vocabulary. He also notes that it will not be a simple or cumulative process, in that new principles will have to be learned and some old principles will have to be unlearned. Brown (1999) indicates that creating new frameworks for the evolving world will require challenging the assumptions that support our traditional intellectual constructs.\n\nIn terms of what will shift, Gilder states that the basic tenet of the knowledge revolution will be the “overthrow of matter.” Wealth, in the form of physical assets will diminish, while wealth, in the form of knowledge assets will increase. The power of mind will usurp the brute force of things. Similarly, Jeremy Rifkin indicates that whereas the industrial age emphasized the exchange of goods and services, the coming age will emphasize the exchange of concepts.\n\nFrom an organizational perspective, Amidon indicates that the knowledge movement is reshaping how organizations are created, evolve, mature, and evolve or die. It is reshaping how business is done, how economies develop, and how societies prosper. Ruggles and Holtshouse note that the movement is characterized by a dispersion of power and by managers who lead by empowering knowledge workers to contribute and make decisions.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, John Seely Brown asks a number of key questions, including who will control the keys to the digital domain? Who will be the trusted intermediary in the marketplace? How transparent will their mediation be? What standards will be used for accountability? Thomas A. Stewart points out that just as the industrial revolution did not end agriculture because people have to eat, this revolution will not end industry because we still need physical products.\n\nThe digital revolution is revolutionizing the future agriculture. Thus, future agriculture, more importantly, the agricultural systems modelling could benefit from the advancements in ICT with big data, crowdsourcing, remote sensing, and high computational abilities, catching up with the relative slow developments over the last two decades. Tools to enable visualization of agricultural source data, model outputs and synthesized data products are needed to enhance the discovery and understanding of information for the entire spectrum of future agriculture users, including data collectors, model developers, model users, integrative research, application developers and end users. To make sense of large amounts of unfamiliar or complex data, humans need overviews, summaries, and the capability to look for patterns and discover emergent phenomena, empirical models, and theories related to the data.\n\n"}
{"id": "9527250", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9527250", "title": "Knowledge organization", "text": "Knowledge organization\n\nKnowledge organization (KO), organization of knowledge, organization of information, or information organization is a branch of library and information science (LIS) concerned with activities such as document description, indexing, and classification performed in libraries, databases, archives, etc. It addresses the \"activities carried out and tools used by people who work in places that accumulate information resources (e.g., books, maps, documents, datasets, images) for the use of humankind, both immediately and for posterity. It discusses the processes that are in place to make resources findable, whether someone is searching for a single known item or is browsing through hundreds of resources just hoping to discover something useful. Information organization supports a myriad of information-seeking scenarios.\" Traditional human-based approaches performed by librarians, archivists, and subject specialists are increasingly challenged by computational (big data) algorithmic techniques. KO as a field of study is concerned with the nature and quality of such knowledge organizing processes (KOP) (such as taxonomy and ontology) as well as the resulting knowledge organizing systems (KOS).\n\nDivergent historical and theoretical approaches towards organizing knowledge are based on different views of knowledge, cognition, language, and social organization. This richness lends itself to many complementary ways to consider knowledge organization. The academic International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) engages with these issues via the research journal \"Knowledge Organization\".\n\nOne widely used analysis of organizational principles summarizes them as Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, Hierarchy (LATCH).\n\nAmong the major figures in the history of KO are Melvil Dewey (1851–1931) and Henry Bliss (1870–1955). \n\nDewey's goal was an efficient way to manage library collections; not an optimal system to support users of libraries. His system was meant to be used in many libraries as a standardized way to manage collections. The first version of this system was created in 1876. \n\nAn important characteristic in Henry Bliss' (and many contemporary thinkers of KO) was that the sciences tend to reflect the order of Nature and that library classification should reflect the order of knowledge as uncovered by science: \nNatural order --> Scientific Classification --> Library classification (KO)\n\nThe implication is that librarians, in order to classify books, should know about scientific developments. This should also be reflected in their education: “Again from the standpoint of the higher education of librarians, the teaching of systems of classification . . . would be perhaps better conducted by including courses in the systematic encyclopedia and methodology of all the sciences, that is to say, outlines which try to summarize the most recent results in the relation to one another in which they are now studied together. . . .” (Ernest Cushing Richardson, quoted from Bliss, 1935, p. 2).\n\nAmong the other principles, which may be attributed to the traditional approach to KO are: \n\n\nToday, after more than 100 years of research and development in LIS, the “traditional” approach still has a strong position in KO and in many ways its principles still dominate.\n\nThe date of the foundation of this approach may be chosen as the publication of S. R. Ranganathan’s Colon Classification in 1933. The approach has been further developed by, in particular, the British Classification Research Group. In many ways this approach has dominated what might be termed “modern classification theory.” \n\nThe best way to explain this approach is probably to explain its analytico-synthetic methodology. The meaning of the term “analysis” is: Breaking down each subject into its basic concepts. The meaning of the term synthesis is: Combining the relevant units and concepts to describe the subject matter of the information package in hand.\n\nGiven subjects (as they appear in, for example, book titles) are first analyzed into a few common categories, which are termed “facets”. Ranganathan proposed his PMEST formula: Personality, Matter, Energy, Space and Time:\n\nImportant in the IR-tradition have been, among others, the Cranfield experiments, which were founded in the 1950s, and the TREC experiments (Text Retrieval Conferences) starting in 1992. It was the Cranfield experiments, which introduced the famous measures “recall” and “precision” as evaluation criteria for systems efficiency. The Cranfield experiments found that classification systems like UDC and facet-analytic systems were less efficient compared to free-text searches or low level indexing systems (“UNITERM”). The Cranfield I test found according to Ellis (1996, 3–6) the following results. \n\nAlthough these results have been criticized and questioned, the IR-tradition became much more influential while library classification research lost influence. The dominant trend has been to regard only statistical averages. What has largely been neglected is to ask: Are there certain kinds of questions in relation to which other kinds of representation, for example, controlled vocabularies, may improve recall and precision?\n\nThe best way to define this approach is probably by method: Systems based upon user-oriented approaches must specify how the design of a system is made on the basis of empirical studies of users. \n\nUser studies demonstrated very early that users prefer verbal search systems as opposed to systems based on classification notations. This is one example of a principle derived from empirical studies of users. Adherents of classification notations may, of course, still have an argument: That notations are well-defined and that users may miss important information by not considering them. \n\nFolksonomies is a recent kind of KO based on users' rather than on librarians' or subject specialists' indexing.\n\nThese approaches are primarily based on using bibliographical references to organize networks of papers, mainly by bibliographic coupling (introduced by Kessler 1963) or co-citation analysis ( independently suggested by Marshakova 1973 and Small 1973). In recent years it has become a popular activity to construe bibliometric maps as structures of research fields. \n\nTwo considerations are important in considering bibliometric approaches to KO: \n\n\nDomain analysis is a sociological-epistemological standpoint. The indexing of a given document should reflect the needs of a given group of users or a given ideal purpose. In other words, any description or representation of a given document is more or less suited to the fulfillment of certain tasks. A description is never objective or neutral, and the goal is not to standardize descriptions or make one description once and for all for different target groups. \n\nThe development of the Danish library “KVINFO” may serve as an example that explains the domain-analytic point of view. \n\nKVINFO was founded by the librarian and writer Nynne Koch and its history goes back to 1965. Nynne Koch was employed at the Royal Library in Copenhagen in a position without influence on book selection. She was interested in women’s’ studies and began personally to collect printed catalog cards of books in the Royal Library, which were considered relevant for women’s studies. She developed a classification system for this subject. Later she became the head of KVINFO and got a budget for buying books and journals, and still later, KVINFO became an independent library. The important theoretical point of view is that the Royal Library had an official systematic catalog of a high standard. Normally it is assumed that such a catalog is able to identify relevant books for users whatever their theoretical orientation. This example demonstrates, however, that for a specific user group (feminist scholars), an alternative way of organizing catalog cards was important. In other words: Different points of view need different systems of organization. \n\nDA is the only approach to KO which has seriously examined epistemological issues in the field, i.e. comparing the assumptions made in different approaches to KO and examining the questions regarding subjectivity and objectivity in KO. Subjectivity is not just about individual differences. Such differences are of minor interest because they cannot be used as guidelines for KO. What seems important are collective views shared by many users. A kind of subjectivity about many users is related to philosophical positions. In any field of knowledge different views are always at play. In arts, for example, different views of art are always present. Such views determine views on art works, writing on art works, how art works are organized in exhibitions and how writings on art are organized in libraries (see Ørom 2003). In general it can be stated that different philosophical positions on any issue have implications for relevance criteria, information needs and for criteria of organizing knowledge.\n\n\n"}

She wrote about Giordano Bruno, ancient Greek philosophy and the history of Serbian philosophy, and translated some of the most important philosophical works into the Serbian language, including works by Aristotle and Plato. She was also an early Serbian feminist writer and philosopher.\n\nKsenija Atanasijević was born on February 5, 1894 in Belgrade, the youngest of six children to Doctor Svetozar Atanasijević and Jelena Atanasijević, née Čumić, who died while giving her birth. Her father was a well-respected doctor and director of the State Hospital in Belgrade. Her mother's family was related to the famed Belgrade lawyer, writer and politician Aćim Čumić. Twelve years later, her father died. Ksenija's stepmother, Sofija Kondić, who taught at the Women's College (\"Viša ženska škola\") in Belgrade, became her rightful guardian. Kondić was well-qualified to continue Ksenija's education. From Kondić Ksenija received her first lessons in philosophy: she learned quickly and eagerly, and no sooner another tragedy befall on her. Ksenija's older brother was killed in World War I.\n\nKsenija's best friends while growing up were poet Rastko Petrović and his sister, painter Nadežda Petrović.\n\nWhile Ksenija attended the Lyceum, she was also influenced by Nada Stoiljković, her philosophy professor. Stoiljković suggested that Ksenija should take up philosophy with her former professor at Belgrade, Branislav Petronijević, and so, in the autumn of 1918, Ksenija Atanasijevic became Petronijevic's pupil at the University of Belgrade.\n\nAuthoritarian and demanding, Petronijević was exactly what Ksenija needed at that point. A brilliant professor and one of the most famous philosophers of his day in Serbia and elsewhere, he was a hard taskmaster.\n\nPetronijević's aim was to challenge his pupils to be able to maintain a philosophical discussion with their tutor. Ksenija was one of the most brilliant students ever to attend the university and it was not long before she attracted the attention of Belgrade's most distinguished intellectuals. She graduated in July 1920 with the highest marks in her graduating class, obtaining a university diploma in \"pure and applied philosophy and classics.\" An excellent student, she decided to pursue an academic career in philosophy and soon after graduation, began working on a doctoral thesis on Giordano Bruno's \"De triplici minimo\". She went to Geneva and Paris to seek out rare philosophical works and to discuss her thesis with specialists in the field, and on January 20, 1922, defended her Ph.D with honors in Belgrade before a panel of academics, including rector Jovan Cvijić, Mihailo Petrović, Milutin Milanković, Veselin Čajkanović, and Branislav Petronijević, her mentor. After her thesis was successfully defended, she became the first woman to hold a Ph.D. in Philosophy in Serbia. She was then 28 years old.\n\nIn 1924, she became the first female university professor to be appointed to the Arts Faculty, Department of Philosophy at the University of Belgrade, where she taught classics, medieval and modern philosophy and aesthetics for twelve years.\n\nDuring her teaching career, she was a committed feminist both in theory and practice. She was a member of the Serbian Women's League for Peace and Freedom, the Women's Movement Alliance, and editor of the first feminist journal in the country, \"The Women's Movement\" (\"Ženski pokret\"), published from 1920 to 1938.\n\nIn 1936, she was removed from her university position on trumped-up charges of plagiarism because some of her male colleagues who worked alongside her felt threatened by her exceptional abilities. It was the result of a reaction to the liberal ideas she espoused and promoted and especially to her decision not to become part of an entirely male-dominated, academic ideological clique. Her sense of intellectual autonomy meant that not only was she unwilling to accept conservative ideologies structuring her teaching and writing, she was also capable of criticizing the work of her peers. At the time the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" cited her study, \"The Metaphysical and Geometrical Doctrine of Bruno\", written in French in Paris in 1924 as an authoritative work about an important and often neglected aspect of Bruno's philosophy. Her consequent dismissal caused a considerably outcry in Belgrade among intellectuals. At a public meeting where many people spoke in support of her, the most prominent speakers were law professor Živojin M. Perić and poets Rastko Petrović and Sima Pandurović.\n\nPandurović, who stood by her throughout the ordeal, was quoted in a newspaper article saying: \"She has been accused at the plenum of the University Council of plagiarism by one member of the faculty who has not the remotest inkling of philosophy and who has unaccountably taken it on himself to defend that discipline from a genuine thinker.\"\n\nDespite the support Atanasijević received, however, her position at the university was never restored to her, and she spent the rest of her working life—until 1941—as an inspector for the Ministry of Education. World War II brought troubles and unrest, even for the apolitical Ksenija Atanasijević. After writing articles against anti-Semitism and National Socialism, she was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942. Then when the war ended, Atansijević was arrested again, but this time by Tito's communists on charges of war crimes, like those attributed to Veselin Čajkanović and others for teaching during Nazi occupation. Once released, she retired in 1946 after a short stint as an employee of the National Library of Serbia.\n\nKsenija Atansijević left a substantial volume of work, including more than 400 texts, among them books and essays in philosophy, psychology, history, and literature. Her interest in philosophy was broad and eclectic, covering ethics, metaphysics, logic, aesthetics and the history of philosophy. She is best known for her original interpretations of Giordano Bruno's work and for her 'philosophy of meaning' developed in \"Filozofski fragmenti\" (Philosophical fragments, 1928–1929), considered by many to be her most important and significant work. She died in Belgrade in 1981.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "332733", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=332733", "title": "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness", "text": "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\n\n\"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\" is a well-known phrase in the United States Declaration of Independence. The phrase gives three examples of the \"unalienable rights\" which the Declaration says have been given to all humans by their creator.\n\nThe United States Declaration of Independence was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, and then edited by the Committee of Five, which consisted of Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Roger Sherman, and Robert Livingston. It was then further edited and adopted by the Committee of the Whole of the Second Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. The second paragraph of the first article in the Declaration of Independence contains the phrase \"Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\".\n\nJefferson's \"original Rough draught\" is on exhibit in the Library of Congress. This version was used by Julian Boyd to create a transcript of Jefferson's draft, which reads:\n\nThe Committee of Five edited Jefferson's draft. Their version survived further edits by the whole Congress intact, and reads:\n\nA number of possible sources or inspirations for Jefferson's use of the phrase in the Declaration of Independence have been identified, although scholars debate the extent to which any one of them actually influenced Jefferson. Jefferson declared himself an Epicurean during his lifetime: this is a philosophical doctrine that teaches the pursuit of happiness, here meaning \"prosperity, thriving, wellbeing\" and proposes autarchy, which translates as self-rule, self-sufficiency or freedom. The greatest disagreement comes between those who suggest the phrase was drawn from John Locke and those who identify some other source.\n\nIn 1689, Locke argued in his \"Two Treatises of Government\" that political society existed for the sake of protecting \"property\", which he defined as a person's \"life, liberty, and estate\". In \"A Letter Concerning Toleration\", he wrote that the magistrate's power was limited to preserving a person's \"civil interest\", which he described as \"life, liberty, health, and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things\". He declared in his \"Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" that \"the highest perfection of intellectual nature lies in a careful and constant pursuit of true and solid happiness\".\n\nAccording to those scholars who saw the root of Jefferson's thought in Locke's doctrine, Jefferson replaced \"estate\" with \"the pursuit of happiness\", although this does not mean that Jefferson meant the \"pursuit of happiness\" to refer primarily or exclusively to property. Under such an assumption, the Declaration of Independence would declare that government existed primarily for the reasons Locke gave, and some have extended that line of thinking to support a conception of limited government.\n\nThe first and second article of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, written by George Mason and adopted unanimously by the Virginia Convention of Delegates on June 12, 1776, speaks of happiness in the context of recognizably Lockean rights and is paradigmatic of the way in which \"the fundamental natural rights of mankind\" were expressed at the time.\n\nBenjamin Franklin was in agreement with Thomas Jefferson in downplaying protection of \"property\" as a goal of government. It is noted that Franklin found property to be a \"creature of society\" and thus, he believed that it should be taxed as a way to finance civil society.\n\nIn 1628, Sir Edward Coke wrote in \"The First Part of the Institutes of the Lawes of England\", his commentary on Thomas de Littleton, that \"It is commonly said that three things be favoured in Law, Life, Liberty, Dower.\" At common law, dower was closely guarded as a means by which the widow and orphan of a deceased landowner could keep their real property.\n\nGarry Wills has argued that Jefferson did not take the phrase from Locke and that it was indeed meant to be a standard by which governments should be judged. Wills suggests Adam Ferguson as a good guide to what Jefferson had in mind:\n\nThe 17th-century cleric and philosopher Richard Cumberland wrote that promoting the well-being of our fellow humans is essential to the \"pursuit of our own happiness\". Locke never associated natural rights with happiness, but his philosophical opponent Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz made such an association in the introduction to his \"Codex Iuris Gentium\". William Wollaston's \"The Religion of Nature Delineated\" describes the \"truest definition\" of \"natural religion\" as being \"\"The pursuit of happiness\" by the practice of reason and truth\". An English translation of Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui's \"Principles of Natural and Politic Law\" prepared in 1763 extolled the \"noble pursuit\" of \"true and solid happiness\" in the opening chapter discussing natural rights. Historian Jack Rakove posits Burlamaqui as the inspiration for Jefferson's phrase.\n\nAnother possible source for the phrase is in the \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\" published by Sir William Blackstone, from 1765 to 1769, which are often cited in the laws of the United States. Blackstone argues that God 'has so intimately connected, so inseparably interwoven the laws of eternal justice with the happiness of each individual, that the latter cannot be attained but by observing the former; and, if the former be punctually obeyed, it cannot but induce the latter. In consequence of which mutual connection of justice and human felicity, he has not perplexed the law of nature with a multitude of abstracted rules and precepts, referring merely to the fitness or unfitness of things, as some have vainly surmised; but has graciously reduced the rule of obedience to this one paternal precept, “that man should pursue his own true and substantial happiness.” This is the foundation of what we call ethics, or natural law.'\n\nOther tripartite mottos include \"liberté, égalité, fraternité\" (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France; \"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit\" (unity, justice and liberty) in Germany and \"peace, order, and good government\" in Canada. It is also similar to a line in the Canadian Charter of Rights: \"life, liberty, security of the person\" (this line was also in the older Canadian Bill of rights, which added \"enjoyment of property\" to the list).\n\nThe phrase can also be found in Chapter III, Article 13 of the 1947 Constitution of Japan, and in President Ho Chi Minh's 1945 declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. An alternative phrase \"life, liberty, and property\", is found in the Declaration of Colonial Rights, a resolution of the First Continental Congress. The Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution declare that governments cannot deprive any person of \"life, liberty, or property\" without due process of law. Also, Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights reads, \"Everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person\".\n"}

He denounced \"parochialism,\" referring to those who insisted upon \"some one method, say that of pragmatism, instrumentalism, idealism, analysis, linguistics or logistics, and denied the importance of meaningfulness of anything which lies beyond its scope or power,\" as well as those who confined their studies to only some historic era.\n\nEarly in the history of the society, there was some dispute about whether certain schools of thought should be included in the program. By the second meeting there was controversy regarding papers by logicians, a controversy possibly fueled by the dominance of positivism in that decade. Before 1960, there had been some fear of admitting the existential metaphysics. However, as Paul Weiss remarked in 1969, the society had succeeded in accomplishing metaphysical diversity: \nA book on the history of the society, \"Being in America: Sixty Years of the Metaphysical Society\", was published by Rodopi in 2014 in its Histories and Addresses of Philosophical Societies Series.\n\nSince the founding of the Metaphysical Society, presidential addresses have been published in the \"Review of Metaphysics\", which was also founded by Paul Weiss.\n\n"}

Moreover, the theory of evolution by natural selection can some how explain the behavior of animals.\n\nDarwinism, psychologist who studies in behavior, stated two consequences of studying behavior.\n\n\n\nThese two results provided two competing systems for study of behavior and evolved into ethology and further evolved into comparative psychology.\n\n"}

He teaches at the Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, and is the son of the anthropologist Claude Meillassoux.\n\nMeillassoux is a former student of the philosophers and Alain Badiou. Badiou, who wrote the foreword for Meillassoux's first book \"After Finitude\" (\"Après la finitude\", 2006), describes the work as introducing an entirely new option into modern philosophy, one that differs from Immanuel Kant's three alternatives of criticism, skepticism, and dogmatism. The book was translated into English by philosopher Ray Brassier. Meillassoux is associated with the speculative realism movement.\n\nIn this book, Meillassoux argues that post-Kantian philosophy is dominated by what he calls \"correlationism,\" the often unstated theory that humans cannot exist without the world nor the world without humans. In Meillassoux's view, this is a dishonest maneuver that allows philosophy to sidestep the problem of how to describe the world as it really is prior to all human access. He terms this pre-human reality the \"ancestral\" realm. In keeping with the mathematical interests of his mentor Alain Badiou, Meillassoux claims that mathematics is what reaches the primary qualities of things as opposed to their secondary qualities as manifested in perception.\n\nMeillassoux tries to show that the agnostic scepticism of those who doubt the reality of cause and effect must be transformed into a radical certainty that there is no such thing as causal necessity at all. This leads Meillassoux to proclaim that it is absolutely necessary that the laws of nature be contingent. The world is a kind of hyper-chaos in which the principle of sufficient reason is abandoned even while the principle of non-contradiction must be retained.\n\nFor these reasons, Meillassoux rejects Kant's so-called Copernican Revolution in philosophy. Since Kant makes the world dependent on the conditions by which humans observe it, Meillassoux accuses Kant of a \"Ptolemaic Counter-Revolution.\"\n\nSeveral of Meillassoux's articles have appeared in English via the British philosophical journal \"Collapse\", helping to spark interest in his work in the Anglophone world. His unpublished dissertation \"L'inexistence divine\" (1997) is forthcoming in book form.\n\nIn September 2011, Meillassoux's book on Stéphane Mallarmé was published in France under the title \"Le nombre et la sirène. Un déchiffrage du coup de dés de Mallarmé\". In this second book, he offers a detailed reading of Mallarmé's famous poem \"Un coup de dés jamais n'abolira le hasard\" (\"A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance\"), in which he finds a numerical code at work in the text.\n\nMeillassoux clarified and revised some of the views exposed in \"After Finitude\" during his lectures at the Free University of Berlin in 2012.\n\n\n\n\n"}

It was the ruling party in Senegal from independence in 1960 until 2000. Ousmane Tanor Dieng has been the First Secretary of the party since 1996. The best-known figure of the PS was Léopold Sédar Senghor, the first President of Senegal.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, the party's candidate, long-time president Abdou Diouf, was defeated by the leader of the Senegalese Democratic Party, Abdoulaye Wade, in a second round of voting. Diouf received the most votes, 41.3%, in the first round, but in the second round he received only 41.51% against Wade. In the parliamentary election held on 29 April 2001, the party won 17.4% of the popular vote and 10 out of 120 seats. Tanor Dieng was the party's candidate in the February 2007 presidential election; he took third place with 13.56% of the vote. The party participated in a boycott of the June 2007 parliamentary election.\n\nThe Socialist Party is a full member of the Socialist International.\n\nThe Socialist Party of Senegal was first created in 1958 right before Senegal gained independence. The Party was founded by Leopold Sedar Senghor and it was in power under him politically from 1960 to 1980. The Socialist Party of Senegal was initially known as the Senegalese Progressive Union (UPS). Senghor had founded the Senegalese Democratic Bloc in 1948 and in 1958 it merged with another political party to become the UPS. The UPS became the ruling party of Senegal in 1960 once independence was gained. The UPS officially was known as the Socialist Party of Senegal starting in 1976.\n\nWhen Senegal gained independence in 1960, Senghor was unanimously elected president. In the early 1960s, there was a personal and political rivalry between President Senghor and Prime Minister Mamadoua Dia. In 1962, there was a coup attempt. Dia accept blame and was sent to prison as a result. In 1963 Senghor ran unopposed for president and consequently won. By 1966, Senegal could be considered a one-party state. This occurred because Senghor was running unopposed as president and the economic stability of Senegal began to fade. Senegal relied heavily on peanut-farming and this source of economic stability was in decline. Single-party rule prevented an overwhelming economic crisis and ensured social stability in Senegal, which was appealing to people in the country.\n\nLeopold Sedar Senghor voluntarily resigned from position of president in 1980 and Abdou Diouf came into power as Senghor's hand-picked successor.\n\nIn the 2000 presidential election, the Socialist Party of Senegal was defeated and no longer the ruling party for the first time in 40 years. Abdou Diouf, the 19-year incumbent of the Social Party, was defeated by Abdoulaye Wade. The removal of Diouf from office by an election broke the political monopoly the Socialist Party had on Senegal and helped establish Senegal as one of the African countries with the most advanced democracies.\n\n"}

It is meant to show the relationships of the surviving manuscripts of the Greek text, with special reference to those which are to be taken into account for a critical edition, hence for translations in modern languages, for commentaries, and for any other kind of scholarly reference to the text of the Metaphysics. It is partly conjectural by its own nature and it is an object of lively debate, since these latest years especially. \nThe main controversial question the stemma is meant to answer is the role of the so called beta group of manuscripts of the Metaphysics, described as a separate beta branch in the stemma. Special focus is on manuscript Ab (Laur. 87.12), as opposed to the alpha group of manuscripts (which forms the main part of the tree) and especially to its oldest representative, namely J (Wien Phil. Gr. 100) and E (Paris. Gr. 1853).\nThe first partial draft of a stemma, including Ab, E, J, has been produced by Alfred Gercke in 1892.\nOn this basis, 20th century editors, William David Ross (1924) and Werner Jaeger (1957), have taken into account eclectically Ab in the one side and J and E on the other.\n\nDifferent versions of the stemma codicum of the \"Metaphysics\" have been proposed since 1970\n, most remarkably by Dieter Harlfinger in 1979.\n\nAccording to Harlfinger’s stemma, current 20th century editions of the \"Metaphysics\" (Ross, Jaeger) rely on the most valuable manuscripts for most of the fourteen books, except for the last ones: starting from the final part of the 12th book, they should not have used Ab, but other beta manuscripts instead (M, C), which form no longer a unified group with Ab.\n\nIn 2010 Silvia Fazzo suggested a revision of Harlfinger’s stemma according to which manuscript Ab should not be followed in the whole of book 12 either, nor in the final part of book 11. She showed that starting from book 11 chapter 8 already Harlfinger’s supposed beta manuscripts Ab, M, C do not form any unified group.\n\nIn 2015 Pantelis Golitsis replied to Fazzo’s revision showing that starting from book 11 chapter 8 manuscripts M and C can not be regarded as representative of a separate beta branch. Based on unpublished new collations funded by the DFG, Golitsis shows that M and C are heavily collated (others would say ‘contaminated’ in this case) with various sources including late manuscripts of the alpha group (when this kind of collation is concerned, Golitsis argues that the idea of contamination should be left aside and rejected). He then submitted a revised version of Harlfinger’s stemma codicum.\n\nIn 2015 Fazzo further argued that neither Ab nor its cognate manuscripts M and C should be followed at all as long as the reading of J and E is not proved to be corrupt. Based on published and available materials she submitted a different stemma where all manuscripts ultimately stem from a unique source, possibly archetype Π from which manuscripts J and E are directly derived. As a consequence, a critical editor is left with manuscripts J and E as the most reliable basis. In 2017 Fazzo submitted her stemma to discussion in the \"Revue d’Histoire des Textes\", prefaced with a general history of the stemma codicum of the Metaphysics. There she agrees with Golitsis vs. Harlfinger that manuscripts M and C should not be regarded as representative of an independent beta source for the final books of the Metaphysics. Moreover, Fazzo argues that the bifid shape of 20th century proposals concerning the stemma codicum heavily depends on the implicit acceptance of Jaeger's genetic views as applied to the manuscripts tradition of the \"Metaphysics\".\n\n"}

The MLO propagate \"Chaos-Gnostic Satanism\" or \"Current 218\".\n\nThe MLO consist of the unified belief in \"Chaosophy\". They believe that Chaos is an infinidimensional and pandimensional plane of possibilities, in contrast to cosmos which only has three spatial dimensions and one linear time dimension.

A human skull was also found at Vlad's place, for which he was charged with possession of human parts. According to the police, the cult never had more than a handful of followers.\n\nDuring their investigations, the police interrogated former members of the MLO, who described the organisation and narrated the occult ceremonies they had attended. Rituals included meditation, invocations of demons and animal sacrifices – cats, which were bought through classified ads. During the weeks that preceded the murder of Josef ben Meddour, Vlad had been more and more extremist in his speech, and the idea of performing human sacrifices, followed by a mass suicide, was discussed at length. During a meeting at Nödtveidt's place, a list of possible victims was made. It included a former follower who had defected, band members from Dissection, and even Nödtveidt's girlfriend.\n\nThese plans led to the defection of some members of the MLO, who did not want to take part in any assassination, or who feared for their own lives. As a result, when the arrests were made, the number of active members was down to three: Nödtveidt, Vlad and his girlfriend.\n\nIn 2006, Nödtveidt committed suicide in a ritual.\n\n"}

This doctrine forms a central part of Peirce's comprehensive evolutionary cosmology. It may be considered both the direct opposite of Einstein's oft quoted dictum that: \"God does not play dice with the universe\" and an early philosophical anticipation of Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.\n\nIn his theory of tychism, Peirce sought to deny the central position of the doctrine of necessity which maintains that \"the state of things existing at any time, together with certain immutable laws, completely determine the state of things at every other time.\" One of the principal arguments of the necessitarians is that their position involves a presupposition of all science. Peirce attacks this idea asserting: \"To 'postulate' a proposition is no more than to hope it is true.\" Thus an avenue is opened up allowing the entry of chance as a fundamental and absolute entity.\n\nPeirce does not, of course, assert that there is \"no\" law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.\nComplete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.\n\nTo explain the presence of such a universal \"law\" Peirce proposes a \"cosmological theory of evolution\" in which law develops out of chance. The hypothesis that \"out of irregularity, regularity constantly evolves\" seemed to him to have decided advantages not the least being its explanation of \"why laws are not precisely or always obeyed, for what is still in a process of evolution can not be supposed to be absolutely fixed.\"\n\nAttempting to provide an explanation of some of the more general observable traits of the universe, Peirce formulates four reasons in support of his hypothesis:\nHe then asks us to consider how these features could possibly be explained by a strictly determined, mechanistic theory of the way of all things.\n\nPeirce very pointedly observed that all the scientifically viable theories of evolution are based on tychistic formulations.\n\nHerbert Spencer had argued that evolution was an inevitable upwards progress driven by the law of the conservation of energy. Peirce rejected this idea, pointing out that energy conservation, like other laws of classical physics, is time-symmetric. Turning to Darwin he points out that the fundamental driver of his theory is accidental variation, noting that \"Darwinian evolution is evolution by the operation of chance, and the destruction of bad results.\" Even the catastrophism of Clarence King and others, which postulates an acceleration in evolutionary change via sudden environmental dislocations, naturally falls under the rubric of tychism.\n\nThis evolutionary aspect of tychism compels Peirce to expand Darwin's view to a cosmological level, sending its operations back to the origin of the universe under the regulative principle of his synechism.\n\n\n\n"}

These hundred peaceful and wrathful deities are believed to manifest to a deceased person following the dissolution of the body and consciousness in the intermediate state, or bardo, between death and rebirth. The best-known, though by no means only, example of this genre of texts and practices is commonly known as the Kar-ling Zhitro cycle after Karma Lingpa, the tertön who (re)discovered or revealed this collection of texts.

In the practice, the deities are first visualized in mandalas of 42 peaceful and 58 wrathful deities centered in the heart, throat and crown chakra, and then in all the channels and nadis of the body.\nShugchang, \"et al.\" (2000) define and frame the Zhi-khro teachings in relation to the Inner Tantras, Anuyoga, Atiyoga, \"Guhyagarbha tantra\", rigpa, Śūnyatā, non-duality, kye-rim, dzog-rim and bardo:\n\nThe \"zhi-khro\", which translates as the peaceful and wrathful deities, is considered part of the inner tantra. It is actually a condensed teaching based upon the essential\nmeaning of the Guhyagarbha Tantra combined with the views expressed in the anu and ati yoga teachings. Many great masters have said that the \"zhi-khro\" teachings are the inner tantra of the inner tantra. In this case we're not making distinctions among the various inner tantras, nor between the creation and completion stages, but joining them all together. This is the union of rigpa and emptiness, the oneness of birth, death, and life experiences. There is no basis for discriminating because all are aspects of one true nature. Nothing is rejected or exclusively accepted. This teaching is known as the one that unifies everything into a single state.\nGyatso (2006) relates how Zhitro was received by Yeshe Tsogyal through the \"wang\" of a Vidyadhara through the Bardo of trance:\n\nAfter succeeding in a variety of feats, including beheading a tiger, she gains access to an elaborate palace where she receives esoteric initiations from several vidyādharas and buddhas. She returns to Chingpu and after a year is robbed by seven bandits whom she then converts to Buddhist practice. She proceeds with the bandits on a magic carpet to the place Oḍḍiyāna where they all receive peaceful and wrathful deity practice (zhitro) initiations from a vidyādhara, who gives her the secret name Kharchen Za and cavorts in bliss with her.\n\n"}
