{"id": "404431", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=404431", "title": "Alexius Meinong", "text": "Alexius Meinong\n\nAlexius Meinong Ritter von Handschuchsheim (17 July 1853 – 27 November 1920) was an Austrian philosopher, a realist known for his unique ontology. He also made contributions to philosophy of mind and theory of value.\nAlexius Meinong's father was the Austrian officer Anton von Meinong (1799–1870), who was granted the hereditary title of Ritter in 1851 and reached the rank of Major General in 1858 before retiring in 1859.\n\nAlexius Meinong studied at the Akademisches Gymnasium, Vienna and later the University of Vienna, where he read history and philosophy as a pupil of Franz Brentano. He was professor and Chair of Philosophy at the University of Graz, where he founded the Graz psychological institute (in 1894) and the Graz School of experimental psychology. Meinong supervised the promotions of Christian von Ehrenfels (founder of \"Gestalt\" psychology) and Adalbert Meingast, as well as the habilitation of Alois Höfler and Anton Oelzelt-Newin.\n\nMeinong wrote two early essays on David Hume, the first dealing with his theory of abstraction, the second with his theory of relations, and was relatively strongly influenced by British empiricism. He is most noted, however, for his Theory of Objects (\"Über Gegenstandstheorie\", 1904), which grew out of his work on intentionality and his belief in the possibility of intending nonexistent objects. The theory is based around the purported empirical observation that it is possible to think about something, such as a golden mountain, even though that object does not exist. Since we can refer to such things, they must have some sort of being. Meinong thus distinguishes the \"being\" of a thing, in virtue of which it may be an object of thought, from a thing's \"existence\", which is the substantive ontological status ascribed to — for example — horses but not to unicorns. Meinong called such nonexistent objects \"homeless\"; others have nicknamed their place of residence \"Meinong's jungle\" because of their great number and exotic nature.\n\nHistorically, Meinong has been treated, especially by Gilbert Ryle, as an eccentric whose theory of objects was allegedly dealt a severe blow in Bertrand Russell's essay \"On Denoting\". However, Russell himself thought highly of the vast majority of Meinong's work and, until formulating his theory of descriptions, held similar views about non-existent objects. Further, recent Meinongians such as Terence Parsons and Roderick Chisholm have established the consistency of a Meinongian theory of objects, while others (e.g., Karel Lambert) have defended the uselessness of such a theory.\n\nMeinong is also seen to be controversial in the field of philosophy of language for holding the view that \"existence\" is merely a property of an object, just as color or mass might be a property. Closer readers of his work, however, accept that Meinong held the view that objects are \"indifferent to being\" and that they stand \"beyond being and non-being\". On this view Meinong is expressly denying that existence is a property of an object. For Meinong, what an object is, its real essence, depends on the properties of the object. These properties are genuinely possessed whether the object exists or not, and so existence cannot be a mere property of an object.\n\nMeinong holds that objects can be divided into three categories on the basis of their ontological status. Objects may have one of the following three modalities of being and non-being:\n\nCertain objects can exist (mountains, birds, etc.); others cannot in principle ever exist, such as the objects of mathematics (numbers, theorems, etc.): such objects simply subsist. Finally, a third class of objects cannot even subsist, such as impossible objects (e.g. square circle, wooden iron, etc.). Being-given is not a minimal mode of being, because it is not a mode of being at all. Rather, to be \"given\" is just to be an object. Being-given, termed \"absistence\" by J.N. Findlay, is better thought of as a mode of non-being than as a mode of being. Absistence, unlike existence and subsistence, does not have a negation; everything absists. (Note that all objects absist, while some subset of these subsist, of which a yet-smaller subset exist.) The result that everything absists allows Meinong to deal with our ability to affirm the non-being (\"Nichtsein\") of an object. Its absistence is evidenced by our act of intending it, which is logically prior to our denying that it has being.\n\nMeinong distinguishes four classes of \"objects\":\n\nTo these four classes of objects correspond four classes of psychological acts:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

He was born in Belmonte, near Calatayud (Aragon). His writings were lauded by Schopenhauer and Nietzsche.\n\nThe son of a doctor, in his childhood Gracián lived with his uncle, who was a priest. He studied at a Jesuit school in 1621 and 1623 and theology in Zaragoza. He was ordained in 1627 and took his final vows in 1635.\n\nHe assumed the vows of the Jesuits in 1633 and dedicated himself to teaching in various Jesuit schools. He spent time in Huesca, where he befriended the local scholar Vincencio Juan de Lastanosa, who helped him achieve an important milestone in his intellectual upbringing. He acquired fame as a preacher, although some of his oratorical displays, such as reading a letter sent from Hell from the pulpit, were frowned upon by his superiors. He was named Rector of the Jesuit College of Tarragona and wrote works proposing models for courtly conduct such as \"El héroe\" (\"The Hero\"), \"El político\" (\"The Politician\"), and \"El discreto\" (\"The Discreet One\"). During the Spanish war with Catalonia and France, he was chaplain of the army that liberated Lleida in 1646.\n\nIn 1651, he published the first part of the \"Criticón\" (\"Faultfinder\") without the permission of his superiors, whom he disobeyed repeatedly. This attracted the Society's displeasure. Ignoring the reprimands, he published the second part of \"Criticón\" in 1657, as a result was sanctioned and exiled to Graus at the beginning of 1658. Soon Gracian wrote to apply for membership in another religious order. His demand was not met, but his sanction was eased off: in April 1658 he was sent to several minor positions under the College of Tarazona. His physical decline prevented him from attending the provincial congregation of Calatayud and on 6 December 1658 Gracian died in Tarazona, near Zaragoza in the Kingdom of Aragon.\n\nGracián is the most representative writer of the Spanish Baroque literary style known as \"Conceptismo\" (Conceptism), of which he was the most important theoretician; his \"Agudeza y arte de ingenio\" (\"Wit and the Art of Inventiveness\") is at once a poetic, a rhetoric and an anthology of the conceptist style.\n\nThe Aragonese village where he was born, Belmonte de Calatayud, changed its name to Belmonte de Gracián in his honour.\n\nThe three parts of the \"Criticón\", published in 1651, 1653, and 1657, achieved fame in Europe, especially in German-speaking countries. It is, without a doubt, the author's masterpiece and one of the great works of the Siglo de Oro. It is a lengthy allegorical novel with philosophical overtones. It recalls the Byzantine style of novel in its many vicissitudes and in the numerous adventures to which the characters are subjected, as well as the picaresque novel in its satirical take on society, as evidenced in the long pilgrimage undertaken by the main characters, Critilo, the \"critical man\" who personifies disillusionment, and Andrenio, the \"natural man\" who represents innocence and primitive impulses. The author constantly exhibits a perspectivist technique that unfolds according to the criteria or points of view of both characters, but in an antithetical rather than plural way as in Miguel de Cervantes. The novel reveals a philosophy, pessimism, with which one of its greatest readers and admirers, the 19th century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, identified.\n\nThe following is a summary of the \"Criticón\", reduced almost to the point of a sketch, of a complex work that demands detailed study.\n\nCritilo, man of the world, is shipwrecked on the coast of the island of Santa Elena, where he meets Andrenio, the natural man, who has grown up completely ignorant of civilization. Together they undertake a long voyage to the Isle of Immortality, travelling the long and prickly road of life. In the first part, \"En la primavera de la niñez\" (\"In the Spring of Childhood\"), they join the royal court, where they suffer all manner of disappointments; in the second part, \"En el otoño de la varonil edad\" (\"In the Autumn of the Age of Manliness\"), they pass through Aragon, where they visit the house of Salastano (an anagram of the name of Gracián's friend Lastanosa), and travel to France, which the author calls the \"wasteland of Hipocrinda\", populated entirely by hypocrites and dunces, ending with a visit to a house of lunatics. In the third part, \"En el invierno de la vejez\" (\"In the Winter of Old Age\"), they arrive in Rome, where they encounter an academy where they meet the most inventive of men, arriving finally at the Isle of Immortality. He is intelligent and contributed greatly to the world. One of his most famous phrases is \"Respect yourself if you would have others respect you.\"\n\nGracián's style, generically called conceptism, is characterized by ellipsis and the concentration of a maximum of significance in a minimum of form, an approach referred to in Spanish as \"agudeza\" (wit), and which is brought to its extreme in the \"Oráculo Manual y Arte de Prudencia\" (literally \"Manual Oracle and Art of Discretion\", commonly translated as \"The Art of Worldly Wisdom\"), which is almost entirely composed of three hundred maxims with commentary. He constantly plays with words: each phrase becomes a puzzle, using the most diverse rhetorical devices.\n\nIts appeal has endured: in 1992, Christopher Maurer's translation of this book remained 18 weeks (2 weeks in first place) in the Washington Post's list of Nonfiction General Best Sellers. It has sold nearly 200,000 copies.\n\nThe 1911 \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" wrote of Gracián that \"He has been excessively praised by Schopenhauer, whose appreciation of the author induced him to translate the \"Oráculo manual\", and he has been unduly depreciated by Ticknor and others. He is an acute thinker and observer, misled by his systematic misanthropy and by his fantastic literary theories\".\n\nNietzsche wrote of the \"Oráculo\", \"Europe has never produced anything finer or more complicated in matters of moral subtlety,\" and Schopenhauer, who translated it into German, considered the book \"Absolutely unique... a book made for constant use...a companion for life\" for \"those who wish to prosper in the great world.\" A translation of the \"Oráculo manual\" from the Spanish by Joseph Jacobs (London: Macmillan and Co., Limited), first published in 1892, was a huge commercial success, with many reprintings over the years (most recently by Shambala). Jacobs’ translation is alleged to have been read by Winston Churchill, seven years later, on the ship taking him to the Boer Wars.\n\nIn Paris, in 1924, a revision and reprint of the translation into French by Abraham-Nicolas Amelot de La Houssaie, with a preface by André Rouveyre, attracted a wide readership there, and was admired by André Gide. A new translation by Christopher Maurer (New York: Doubleday) became a national bestseller in the U.S. in 1992 , and the English edition, which sold almost 200,000 copies, was translated into Finnish, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, and many other languages.\n\n\nThe only publication which bears Gracián's name is \"El Comulgatorio\" (1655); his more important books were issued under the pseudonym of Lorenzo Gracián (a brother of the writer) or under the anagram of Gracía de Marlones. Gracián was punished for publishing without his superior's permission \"El Criticón\" (in which Defoe is alleged to have found the germ of \"Robinson Crusoe\"): but no objection was taken to its substance.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "43405831", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43405831", "title": "Confucian church", "text": "Confucian church\n\nThe Confucian church ( or ) is a Confucian religious and social institution of the congregational type. It was first proposed by Kang Youwei (1858–1927) in the last years of the 19th century, as a state religion of Qing China on the model of Europe.\n\nThe \"Confucian church\" model was later continued amongst overseas Chinese communities, who established independent Confucian churches active on the local level, especially in Indonesia and the United States.\n\nIn contemporary China, since 2000, there has been a revival of Confucianism with the proliferation of Confucian academies (), the opening and reopening of temples of Confucius, the new phenomenon of grassroots Confucian communities or congregations () and renewed talks about a national \"Confucian church\". A national Holy Confucian Church () was established with the participation of many Confucian leaders on November 1, 2015; the current spiritual leader is Jiang Qing.\n\nThe idea of a \"Confucian Church\" as the state religion of China was proposed in detail by Kang Youwei as part of an early New Confucian search for a regeneration of the social relevance of Confucianism, at a time when it was de-institutionalised with the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the Chinese empire. Kang modeled his ideal \"Confucian Church\" after European national Christian churches, as a hierarchical and centralised institution, closely bound to the state, with local church branches, Sunday prayers and choirs, missions, journals, and even baptism sometimes, devoted to the worship and the spread of the teachings of Confucius.\n\nThe large community of Confucian literati who were left bereft of a ritual and organisational outlet for their values and identity after the dissolution of state Confucianism, supported such projects. Similar models were also followed by various newly created Confucian folk religious sects, such as the Xixinshe, the Daode Xueshe, and the Wanguo Daodehui.\n\nThe Confucian Church was founded by a disciple of Kang, Chen Huanzhang, in 1912, and within a few years it established 132 branches countrywise. From 1913 to 1916, an important debate took place whether Confucianism should become the state religion (\"guo jiao\") and as such inscribed in the constitution of China. This finally didn't occur, and anti-religious campaigns mounting in the 1920s led to a dissolution of the Confucian church.\n\nWhile Kang's idea was not realised in China, it was carried forward in Hong Kong and amongst overseas Chinese peoples. The Hong Kong branch of Kang's movement took the name of \"Confucian Academy\" (), while the Indonesian branch became the Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia. Members believe in \"Tian\" with Confucius as the prophet (Indonesian \"nabi\"). Chinese people in the United States established independent, local Confucian churches such as the Confucius Church of Sacramento or the Confucius Church of Salinas.\n\nIn contemporary China, the Confucian revival has developed into different, yet interwoven, directions: the proliferation of Confucian academies, the resurgence of Confucian rites, and the birth of new forms of Confucian activity on the popular level, such as the Confucian communities. Some scholars also consider the reconstruction of Chinese lineage associations and their ancestral shrines, as well as cults and temples of natural and national gods within broader Chinese traditional religion, as part of the revival of Confucianism.\n\nOther forms of revival are folk religious or salvationist religious groups with a Confucian focus or Confucian churches, for example the \"Yidan xuetang\" (一耽学堂) based in Beijing, the \"Mengmutang\" (孟母堂) of Shanghai, the Way of the Gods according to the Confucian Tradition or Phoenix Churches, the Confucian Fellowship (儒教道坛 \"Rújiào Dàotán\") in northern Fujian which has spread rapidly over the years after its foundation, and ancestral shrines of the Kong family operating as well as Confucian-teaching churches.\n\nAlso, the Hong Kong Confucian Academy has expanded its activities to the mainland, with the construction of statues of Confucius, Confucian hospitals, restoration of temples and sponsorship of other activities. In 2009 Zhou Beichen founded another institution that inherits the idea of Kang Youwei's Confucian Church, the Holy Hall of Confucius (孔圣堂 \"Kǒngshèngtáng\") in Shenzhen affiliated with the Federation of Confucian Culture of Qufu, the first of a nationwide movement of congregations and civil organisations that was unified in 2015 by the Holy Confucian Church (孔圣会 \"Kǒngshènghuì\").\n\nChinese folk religion's temples and kinship ancestral shrines on special occasion may choose Confucian liturgy (that is called 儒 \"rú\", or sometimes 正统 \"zhèngtǒng\", meaning \"orthoprax ritual style\") led by Confucian ritual masters (礼生 \"lǐshēng\") to worship the gods enshrined, instead of Taoist or popular ritual. \"Confucian businessmen\" (\"rushang\", also \"learned businessman\"), is a recently recovered term to identify people of the entrepreneurial or economic elite who recognise their social responsibility and therefore apply Confucian culture to their business.\n\nContemporary New Confucian scholars Jiang Qing and Kang Xiaoguang are amongst the most influential supporters of institutionalising the Confucian revival as a national \"Confucian Church\". Jiang Qing is the current spiritual leader of the Holy Confucian Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

For example, instead of quietly asking customers for their opinions about food in a restaurant, making an announcement about food quality, as being tested in a survey, could cause cooks to focus on having high-quality results. The concept can also apply to changing the method of observation, rather than affecting the data. For example, if after asking several customers about food, they noted the food as generally good or fair, then the questions might be changed to ask, more specifically, which food items were most/least liked. Hence, the interplay can alter either the observations, or the method of observation, or both.\n\nThe effects of epistemic feedback can be viewed as either negative or positive, depending on the goal of the observations. When trying to get a secret survey of results, then epistemic feedback can be seen as a negative factor which distorts the original data. However, if the goal is to improve quality, then epistemic feedback could be a positive factor to periodically report areas which need improvement. The risk comes when the feedback temporarily slants the evaluation of quality, so that long-term performance is hindered by current distortion in the way results were measured.\n\nSome methods to compensate for epistemic feedback are to use a \"double-blind study\" or to conduct secret surveys to quietly check the results. Also, \"controlled experiments\" can be used, where the outcome is adjusted for the placebo effect of reactions to unchanged parameters. Additionally, longitudinal studies, re-assessing the results over a long period of time, can reduce the impact of short-term feedback on the observed results.\n\n"}

His ideas laid a foundation for many significant developments in both linguistics and semiology in the 20th century. He is widely considered one of the founders of 20th-century linguistics and one of two major founders (together with Charles Sanders Peirce) of semiotics/semiology.\n\nOne of his translators, Roy Harris, summarized Saussure's contribution to linguistics and the study of \"the whole range of human sciences. It is particularly marked in linguistics, philosophy, psychology, sociology and anthropology.\" Although they have undergone extension and critique over time, the dimensions of organization introduced by Saussure continue to inform contemporary approaches to the phenomenon of language. Prague school linguist Jan Mukařovský writes that Saussure's \"discovery of the internal structure of the linguistic sign differentiated the sign both from mere acoustic 'things'... and from mental processes\", and that in this development \"new roads were thereby opened not only for linguistics, but also, in the future, for the theory of literature\". Ruqaiya Hasan argues that \"the impact of Saussure’s theory of the linguistic sign has been such that modern linguists and their theories have since been positioned by reference to him: they are known as pre-Saussurean, Saussurean, anti-Saussurean, post-Saussurean, or non-Saussure\".\n\nHe was born in Geneva in 1857. His father was Henri Louis Frédéric de Saussure, a mineralogist, entomologist, and taxonomist. Saussure showed signs of considerable talent and intellectual ability as early as the age of fourteen. In the autumn of 1870, he began attending the Institution Martine (previously the Institution Lecoultre until 1969), in Geneva. There he lived with the family of a classmate, Elie David. Graduating at the top of class, Saussure expected to continue his studies at the Gymnase de Genève, but his father decided he was not mature enough at fourteen and a half, and sent him to the Collège de Genève instead. Saussure was not pleased, as he complained: \"I entered the Collège de Genève, to waste a year there as completely as a year can be wasted.\"\n\nAfter a year of studying Latin, Ancient Greek and Sanskrit and taking a variety of courses at the University of Geneva, he commenced graduate work at the University of Leipzig in 1876.\n\nTwo years later, at 21, Saussure published a book entitled \"Mémoire sur le système primitif des voyelles dans les langues indo-européennes\" (\"Dissertation on the Primitive Vowel System in Indo-European Languages\"). After this he studied for a year at the University of Berlin under the \"Privatdozenten\" Heinrich Zimmer, with whom he studied Celtic, and Hermann Oldenberg with whom he continued his studies of Sanskrit. He returned to Leipzig to defend his doctoral dissertation \"De l'emploi du génitif absolu en Sanscrit\", and was awarded his doctorate in February 1880. Soon, he relocated to the University of Paris, where he lectured on Sanskrit, Gothic and Old High German and occasionally other subjects.\n\nFerdinand de Saussure is one of the world’s most quoted linguists, which is remarkable as he himself hardly published anything during his lifetime. Even his few scientific articles are not unproblematic. Thus, for example, his publication on Lithuanian phonetics is grosso modo taken from studies by the Lithuanian researcher Friedrich Kurschat, with whom Saussure traveled through Lithuania in August 1880 for two weeks and whose (German) books Saussure had read.. Saussure, who had studied some basic grammar of Lithuanian in Leipzig for one semester but was unable to speak the language, was thus dependent on Kurschat. It is also questionable to what extent the Cours itself can be traced back to Saussure (alone). Studies have shown that at least the current version and its content are more likely to have the so-called editors Charles Bally and Albert Sèchehaye as their source than Saussure himself.\n\nHe taught at the École pratique des hautes études for eleven years during which he was named Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur (Knight of the Legion of Honor). When offered a professorship in Geneva in 1892, he returned to Switzerland. Saussure lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European at the University of Geneva for the remainder of his life. It was not until 1907 that Saussure began teaching the Course of General Linguistics, which he would offer three times, ending in the summer of 1911. He died in 1913 in Vufflens-le-Château, Vaud, Switzerland. His brothers were the linguist and Esperantist René de Saussure, and scholar of ancient Chinese astronomy, Léopold de Saussure. In turn, his son was the psychoanalyst Raymond de Saussure.\n\nSaussure attempted, at various times in the 1880s and 1890s, to write a book on general linguistic matters. His lectures about important principles of language description in Geneva between 1907 and 1911 were collected and published by his pupils posthumously in the famous \"Cours de linguistique générale\" in 1916. Some of his manuscripts, including an unfinished essay discovered in 1996, were published in \"Writings in General Linguistics\", but most of the material in it had already been published in Engler's critical edition of the \"Course\", in 1967 and 1974. (TUFA)\n\nSaussure's theoretical reconstructions of the Proto-Indo-European language vocalic system and particularly his theory of laryngeals, otherwise unattested at the time, bore fruit and found confirmation after the decipherment of Hittite in the work of later generations of linguists such as Émile Benveniste and Walter Couvreur, who both drew direct inspiration from their reading of the 1878 \"Mémoire\". \n\nSaussure had a major impact on the development of linguistic theory in the first half of the 20th century. His two currents of thought emerged independently of each other, one in Europe, the other in America. The results of each incorporated the basic notions of Saussure's thought in forming the central tenets of structural linguistics. According to him, linguistic entities are parts of a system and are defined by their relations to one another within said system. The thinker used the game of chess for his analogy, citing that the game is not defined by the physical attributes of the chess pieces but the relation of each piece to the other pieces. \n\nSaussure's status in contemporary theoretical linguistics, however, is much diminished, with many key positions now dated or subject to challenge, but post-structuralist 21st-century reception remains more open to Saussure's influence. His main contribution to structuralism was his theory of a two-tiered reality about language. The first is the \"langue\", the abstract and invisible layer, while the second, the \"parole\", refers to the actual speech that we hear in real life. This framework was later adopted by Claude Levi-Strauss, who used the two-tiered model to determine the reality of myths. His idea was that all myths have an underlying pattern, which form the structure that makes them myths. These established the structuralist framework to literary criticism.\n\nIn Europe, the most important work in that period of influence was done by the Prague school. Most notably, Nikolay Trubetzkoy and Roman Jakobson headed the efforts of the Prague School in setting the course of phonological theory in the decades from 1940. Jakobson's universalizing structural-functional theory of phonology, based on a markedness hierarchy of distinctive features, was the first successful solution of a plane of linguistic analysis according to the Saussurean hypotheses. Elsewhere, Louis Hjelmslev and the Copenhagen School proposed new interpretations of linguistics from structuralist theoretical frameworks.\n\nIn America, Saussure's ideas informed the distributionalism of Leonard Bloomfield and the post-Bloomfieldian structuralism of such scholars as Eugene Nida, Bernard Bloch, George L. Trager, Rulon S. Wells III, Charles Hockett and, through Zellig Harris, the young Noam Chomsky. In addition to Chomsky's theory of transformational grammar, other contemporary developments of structuralism included Kenneth Pike's theory of tagmemics, Sidney Lamb's theory of stratificational grammar, and Michael Silverstein's work. Systemic functional linguistics is a theory considered to be based firmly on the Saussurean principles of the sign, albeit with some modifications. Ruqaiya Hasan describes systemic functional linguistics as a 'post-Saussurean' linguistic theory. Michael Halliday argues:\n\nSaussure's most influential work, \"Course in General Linguistics\" (\"Cours de linguistique générale\"), was published posthumously in 1916 by former students Charles Bally and Albert Sechehaye, on the basis of notes taken from Saussure's lectures in Geneva. The \"Course\" became one of the seminal linguistics works of the 20th century not primarily for the content (many of the ideas had been anticipated in the works of other 20th century linguists) but for the innovative approach that Saussure applied in discussing linguistic phenomena.\n\nIts central notion is that language may be analyzed as a formal system of differential elements, apart from the messy dialectics of real-time production and comprehension. Examples of these elements include his notion of the linguistic sign, which is composed of the signifier and the signified. Though the sign may also have a referent, Saussure took that to lie beyond the linguist's purview.\n\nThroughout the book, he stated that a linguist can develop a diachronic analysis of a text or theory of language but must learn just as much or more about the language/text as it exists at any moment in time (i.e. \"synchronically\"): \"Language is a system of signs that expresses ideas\". A science that studies the life of signs within society and is a part of social and general psychology. Saussure believed that semiotics is concerned with everything that can be taken as a sign, he called it semiology.\n\nWhile a student, Saussure published an important work in Indo-European philology that proposed the existence of ghosts in Proto-Indo-European called \"sonant coefficients\". The Scandinavian scholar Hermann Möller suggested that they might actually be laryngeal consonants, leading to what is now known as the laryngeal theory. It has been argued that the problem that Saussure encountered, trying to explain how he was able to make systematic and predictive hypotheses from known linguistic data to unknown linguistic data, stimulated his development of structuralism. His predictions about the existence of primate coefficients/laryngeals and their evolution proved a success when Hittite texts were discovered and deciphered, some 50 years later.\n\nThe closing sentence of Saussure's \"Course in General Linguistics\" has been challenged in many academic disciplines and subdisciplines with its contention that \"linguistics has as its unique and true object the language envisioned in itself and for itself\". By the latter half of the 20th century, many of Saussure's ideas were under heavy criticism.\n\nSaussure's linguistic ideas are still considered important for their time but have since suffered considerably under rhetorical developments aimed at showing how linguistics had changed or was changing with the times. As a consequence, Saussure's ideas are now often presented by professional linguists as outdated and as superseded by developments such as cognitive linguistics and generative grammar or have been so modified in their basic tenets as to make their use in their original formulations difficult without risking distortion, as in systemic linguistics. That development is occasionally overstated, however; Jan Koster states, \"Saussure, considered the most important linguist of the century in Europe until the 1950s, hardly plays a role in current theoretical thinking about language,\" Over-reactions can also be seen in comments of the cognitive linguist Mark Turner who reports that many of Saussure's concepts were \"wrong on a grand scale\". It is necessary to be rather more finely nuanced in the positions attributed to Saussure and in their longterm influence on the development of linguistic theorizing in all schools; for a more recent rereading of Saussure with respect to such issues, see Paul Thibault. Just as many principles of structural linguistics are still pursued, modified and adapted in current practice and according to what has been learnt since about the embodied functioning of brain and the role of language within this, basic tenets begun with Saussure still can be found operating behind the scenes today.\n\nSaussure is one of the founding fathers of semiotics. His term for the field was \"semiology.\" Instead of focusing his theory on the origins of language and its historical aspects, Saussure concentrated on the patterns and functions of language itself. He believed that the relationship that exists between the signifier and the signified is purely arbitrary and analytical. His \"sign/signifier/signified/referent\" scheme forms the core of the field. Equally crucial but often overlooked or misapplied is the dimension of the syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes of linguistic description.\n\nSome linguists have pointed out to the fact that Saussure did not 'invent' semiotics but built upon Neoplatonist/Augustinian knowledge from the Middle Ages, particularly in regard to the writings of Augustine of Hippo: \"as for the constitution of Saussurian semiotic theory, the importance of the Augustinian thought contribution (correlated to the Stoic one) has also been recognized. Saussure did not do anything but reform an ancient theory in Europe, according to the modern conceptual exigencies\".\n\nThe principles and methods employed by structuralism were later adapted in diverse fields by French intellectuals such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, and Claude Lévi-Strauss. Such scholars took influence from Saussure's ideas in their own areas of study (literary studies/philosophy, psychoanalysis, anthropology, respectively). However, their analogous interpretations of Saussure's linguistic theories led to proclamations of the end of structuralism in the two disciplines.\n\n\n\n"}

Since 1992, the foundation has been recognized as a \"public utility\" (French: Déclaration d'utilité publique).\n\nBardot's initial involvement with animal rights was in 1962, after seeing photographs of the conditions in which animals were killed. Upon this, Bardot immediately began advocating against the use of painful electric shock pistols in slaughterhouses, and became a vegetarian. In 1967, Bardot was received at the Élysée Palace where she met with Charles de Gaulle, the then president of France. It was a few years later that Bardot obtained the \"stunning before slaughter\" rights from the government. \n\nIn 1977, Bardot went on to campaign against the hunting of baby Harp seals. Upon invitation from Paul Watson, of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, Bardot embarked on a five day trip to the ice fields in Blanc-Sablon, Canada, receiving significant media attention. In addition, the trip also gained Bardot the support of French president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, leading to changes regarding the import of seal products.\n\n\"The Brigitte Bardot Foundation\" (La Fondation Brigitte Bardot) was launched by Bardot in Saint-Tropez, in 1986 where she auctioned her jewellery and other personal possessions to raise 3 million French francs for her campaigns and activities. \n\nIn 1988, the organization moved to Paris. It was here that Bardot led a television series entitled \"S.O.S. Animaux.\" The show aired from 1989 through 1992, over which time it spread its purpose of influencing public opinion of animal cruelty.\n\nIn 1991, Bardot donated her Saint Tropez property, \"La Madrague\" to the foundation so as to raise the capital required to obtain a declaration of public utility. The declaration was granted on February 21, 1992, by the Conseil d'État.\n\nIn 1995, the Dalai Lama became an honorary member of the foundation. \n\nThe Foundation celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2006. It reached 75,000 members by the year 2014.\n\nThe foundation has helped create shelters for elephants in South Africa, koalas in Australia, dancing bears in Bulgaria, and primates in Cameroon. It has also reintroduced several animal species that had completely disappeared in Senegal and participated in the reintroduction of wolves to the Alps. A mobile veterinary clinic has also been created for the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\nThe foundation is a regular plaintiff in lawsuits against animal cruelty. In January 2016, to support the proposition of a law to ban force-feeding on ducks and geese, the foundation invited Pamela Anderson to speak at the French National Assembly.\n\nWhile funding other French animal shelters, the foundation has also created its own shelter, \"La Mare Anzou\", located in a ruined mansion in the department of Eure in Normandy. It covers several hectares, where 200 dogs and 250 cats wait for adoption. This shelter is also a \"retirement home\" for several horses, cows, etc. After complaints from local residents about noise nuisance threatened to close the shelter in 2009, the foundation began soundproofing construction, investing 3 million euros to date.\n\nOn 23 December 2006, Brigitte Bardot published a letter to Nicolas Sarkozy in the Foundation's newsletter, \"L'info-journal\" (published every trimester since 1992), condemning the practice of the Eid al-Adha in France. This caused her be charged with and later fined for incitement to racial hatred.\n\nIn 2009, the foundation launched a campaign against hippophagy titled \"Le cheval vous l'aimez comment?\" ( \"The horse, how do you like it?\"). The foundation was banned from the Salon du Cheval (Paris Horse Show), the organizers of the event stating, \"This is not a place to develop a view point on hippophagy\". In the winter of this year, the foundation launched \"Fourrure : signe extérieur de cruauté\" (\"Fur : external sign of cruelty\"), a national campaign of posters and television spots against fur. The French fur association attempted to ban these advertisements, without success. In December 2005, a new communication campaign \"Fourrure, le look qui tue\" (\"Fur, the look that kills\") was launched in France. The foundation has also supported the yearly \"day without fur,\" on every first Saturday of winter sales since 2007.\n\nIn 2011, the boat \"MV Brigitte Bardot,\" co-financed by the foundation and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society of Paul Watson, was damaged by a wave. It was repaired and put back on the water the next year. In 2015, it was exhibited in Paris after a campaign in the Faroe Islands to save the cetaceans.\n\nThe Fondation Brigitte Bardot campaign fought against:\n\n\n"}

Anzaldúa\n\nGloria Evangelina Anzaldúa (September 26, 1942 – May 15, 2004) was an American scholar of Chicana cultural theory, feminist theory, and queer theory. She loosely based her best-known book, \"\", on her life growing up on the Mexico–Texas border and incorporated her lifelong experiences of social and cultural marginalization into her work. She also developed theories about the marginal, in-between, and mixed cultures that develop along borders.\n\nAnzaldúa was born in the Rio Grande Valley of south Texas on September 26, 1942, to Urbano Anzaldúa and Amalia Anzaldúa \"née\" García. Gloria Anzaldúa's great-grandfather, Urbano Sr., once a precinct judge in Hidalgo County, was the first owner of the Jesús María Ranch on which she was born. Her mother grew up on an adjoining ranch, Los Vergeles (\"the gardens\"), which was owned by her family, and she met and married Urbano Anzaldúa when both were very young. Anzaldúa was a descendant of many of the prominent Spanish explorers and settlers to come to the Americas in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and also had indigenous ancestry. The surname Anzaldúa is of Basque origin.\n\nWhen she was eleven, her family relocated to Hargill, Texas. In 1968, she received a B.A. in English, Art, and Secondary Education from University of Texas–Pan American, and an M.A. in English and Education from the University of Texas at Austin. While in Austin, she joined politically active cultural poets and radical dramatists such as Ricardo Sanchez, and Hedwig Gorski.\n\nAfter obtaining a Bachelor of Arts in English from the then Pan American University (now University of Texas Rio Grande Valley), Anzaldúa worked as a preschool and special education teacher. In 1977, she moved to California, where she supported herself through her writing, lectures, and occasional teaching stints about feminism, Chicano studies, and creative writing at San Francisco State University, the University of California, Santa Cruz, Florida Atlantic University, and other universities.\n\nShe is perhaps most famous for co-editing \"\" (1981) with Cherríe Moraga, editing \"Making Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras: Creative and Critical Perspectives by Women of Color\" (1990), and co-editing \"This Bridge We Call Home: Radical Visions for Transformation\" (2002). She also wrote the semi-autobiographical \"\" (1987). She was close to completing the book manuscript, \"Light in the Dark/Luz en lo Oscuro: Rewriting Identity, Spirituality, Reality\", which she also planned to submit as her dissertation. It has now been published posthumously by Duke University Press (2015). Her children's books include \"Prietita Has a Friend\" (1991), \"Friends from the Other Side — Amigos del Otro Lado\" (1993), and \"Prietita y La Llorona\" (1996). She has also authored many fictional and poetic works.\n\nShe made contributions to fields of feminism and contributed to the field of cultural theory/Chicana and queer theory.\n\nAnzaldúa wrote a speech called \"Speaking in Tongues: A Letter to Third World Women Writers\" focusing on the shift towards an equal and just gender representation in literature but away from racial and cultural issues because of the rise of female writers and theorists. She also stressed in her essay the power of writing to create a world that would compensate for what the real world does not offer.\n\nAnzaldúa's essay '\"La Prieta\" deals with her manifestation of thoughts and horrors that have constituted her life in Texas. Anzaldúa identifies herself as an entity without a figurative home and/or peoples to completely relate to. To supplement this deficiency, Anzaldúa created her own sanctuary, Mundo Zurdo, whereby her personality transcends the norm-based lines of relating to a certain group. Instead, in her Mundo Zurdo, she is like a \"Shiva, a many-armed and legged body with one foot on brown soil, one on white, one in straight society, one in the gay world, the man's world, the women's, one limb in the literary world, another in the working class, the socialist, and the occult worlds\". The passage describes the identity battles which the author had to engage in throughout her life. Since early childhood, Anzaldúa has had to deal with the challenge of being a woman of color. From the beginnings she was exposed to her own people, to her own family's racism and \"fear of women and sexuality\". Her family's internalized racism immediately cast her as the \"other\" because of their bias that being white and fair-skinned means prestige and royalty, when color subjects one to being almost the scum of society (just as her mother had complained about her \"prieta\" dating a \"mojado\" from Peru). The household she grew up in was one in which the male figure was the authoritarian head, while the female, the mother, was stuck in all the biases of this paradigm. Although this is the difficult position in which white, patriarchal society has cast women of color, gays and lesbians, she does not make them out to be the archenemy, because she believes that \"casting stones is not the solution\" and that racism and sexism do not come from only whites but also people of color. Throughout her life, the inner racism and sexism from her childhood would haunt her, as she often was asked to choose her loyalties, whether it be to women, to people of color, or to gays/lesbians. Her analogy to Shiva is well-fitted, as she decides to go against these conventions and enter her own world: Mundo Zurdo, which allows the self to go deeper, to transcend the lines of convention and, at the same time, to recreate the self and the society. This is for Anzaldúa a form of religion, one that allows the self to deal with the injustices that society throws at it and to come out a better person, a more reasonable person.\n\nAn entry in the book titled \"Speaking In Tongues: A Letter To Third World Women Writers\", spotlights the dangers Anzaldúa considers women writers of color deal with, and these dangers are rooted in a lack of privileges. She talks about the transformation of writing styles and how we are taught not to air our truths. Folks are outcast as a result of speaking and writing with their native tongues. Anzaldúa wants more women writers of color to be visible and be well represented in text. Her essay compels us to write with compassion and with love. For writing is a form of gaining power by speaking our truths, and it is seen as a way to decolonize, to resist, and to unite women of color collectively within the feminist movement.\n\nAnzaldúa is highly known for this semi-autobiographical book, which discusses her life growing up on the Mexico–Texas border. It was selected as one of the 38 best books of 1987 by \"Literary Journal\". \"Borderlands\" examines the condition of women in Chicano and Latino culture. Anzaldúa discusses several critical issues related to Chicana experiences: heteronormativity, colonialism, and male dominance. She gives a very personal account of the oppression of Chicana lesbians and talks about the gendered expectations of behavior that normalizes women's deference to male authority in her community. She develops the idea of the \"new mestiza\" as a \"new higher consciousness\" that will break down barriers and fight against the male/female dualistic norms of gender. The first half of the book is a series of essays, which feature a view into a life of isolation and loneliness in the borderlands between cultures. The latter half of the book is poetry. In the book, Anzaldúa uses two variations of English and six variations of Spanish. By doing this, she deliberately makes it difficult for non-bilinguals to read. Language was one of the barriers Anzaldúa dealt with as a child, and she wanted readers to understand how frustrating things are when there are language barriers. The book was written as an outlet for her anger and encourages one to be proud of one's heritage and culture.\n\n\"Light in the Dark⁄Luz en lo Oscuro: Rewriting Identity, Spirituality, Reality\"\n\nAnzaldúa wrote \"Light in the Dark\" during the last decade of her life. Drawn from her unfinished dissertation for her PhD in Literature from University of California, Santa Cruz, the book is carefully organized from The Gloria Anzaldúa Papers, 1942-2004 by AnaLouise Keating, Anzaldúa's literary trustee. The book represents her most developed philosophy. Throughout \"Light in the Dark\", Anzaldúa weaves personal narratives into deeply engaging theoretical readings to comment on numerous contemporary issues—including the September 11 attacks, neocolonial practices in the art world, and coalitional politics. She valorizes subaltern forms and methods of knowing, being, and creating that have been marginalized by Western thought, and theorizes her writing process as a fully embodied artistic, spiritual, and political practice. \"Light in the Dark\" contains multiple transformative theories including include the nepantleras, the Coyolxauhqui imperative, spiritual activism, and others.\n\nAnzaldúa drew on Nepantla, a Nahuatl word that means \"in the middle\" to conceptualise her experience as a Chicana woman. She coined the term, \"Nepantlera\". \"Nepantleras are threshold people; they move within and among multiple, often conflicting, worlds and refuse to align themselves exclusively with any single individual, group, or belief system.\" \n\nAnzaldúa described herself as a very spiritual person and stated that she experienced four out-of-body experiences during her lifetime. In many of her works, she referred to her devotion to la Virgen de Guadalupe (Our Lady of Guadalupe), Nahuatl/Toltec divinities, and to the Yoruba orishás Yemayá and Oshún. In 1993, she expressed regret that scholars had largely ignored the \"unsafe\" spiritual aspects of \"Borderlands\" and bemoaned the resistance to such an important part of her work. In her later writings, she developed the concepts of spiritual activism and nepantleras to describe the ways contemporary social actors can combine spirituality with politics to enact revolutionary change.\n\nAnzaldua's works weave English and Spanish together as one language, an idea stemming from her theory of \"borderlands\" identity. Her autobiographical essay, \"La Prieta,\" was published in (mostly) English in \"This Bridge Called My Back\", and in (mostly) Spanish in \"Esta puente, mi espalda: Voces de mujeres tercermundistas en los Estados Unidos\". In her writing, Anzaldúa uses a unique blend of eight dialects, two variations of English and six of Spanish. In many ways, by writing in a mix of languages, Anzaldúa creates a daunting task for the non-bilingual reader to decipher the full meaning of the text. Language, clearly one of the borders Anzaldúa addressed, is an essential feature to her writing. Her book is dedicated to being proud of one's heritage and to recognizing the many dimensions of her culture.\n\nAnzaldúa emphasized in her writing the connection between language and identity. She expressed dismay with people who gave up their native language in order to conform to the society they were in. Anzaldúa was often scolded for her improper Spanish accent and believed it was a strong aspect to her heritage; therefore, she labels the qualitative labeling of language \"linguistic terrorism.\" She spent a lot of time promoting acceptance of all languages and accents. In an effort to expose her stance on linguistics and labels, Anzaldúa explained, \"While I advocate putting Chicana, \"tejana\", working-class, dyke-feminist poet, writer theorist in front of my name, I do so for reasons different than those of the dominant culture... so that the Chicana and lesbian and all the other persons in me don't get erased, omitted, or killed.\"\n\nAnzaldúa began menstruating when she was only three months old, a symptom of the endocrine condition that caused her to stop growing physically at the age of twelve. As a child, she would wear special girdles fashioned for her by her mother in order to disguise her precocious sexual development. Her mother would also ensure that a cloth was placed in Anzaldúa's underwear as a child in case of bleeding. Anzaldúa remembers, \"I'd take [the bloody cloths] out into this shed, wash them out, and hang them really low on a cactus so nobody would see them... My genitals... [were] always a smelly place that dripped blood and had to be hidden.\" She eventually underwent a hysterectomy in 1980 when she was 38 years old to deal with uterine, cervical, and ovarian abnormalities.\n\nOne of her major contributions was her introduction to United States academic audiences of the term \"mestizaje,\" meaning a state of being beyond (\"either-or\") conception, into academic writing and discussion. In her theoretical works, Anzaldúa called for a \"new mestiza,\" which she described as an individual aware of her conflicting and meshing identities and uses these \"new angles of vision\" to challenge binary thinking in the Western world. The \"borderlands\" that she refers to in her writing are geographical as well as a reference to mixed races, heritages, religions, sexualities, and languages. Anzaldúa is primarily interested in the contradictions and juxtapositions of conflicting and intersecting identities. She points out that having to identify as a certain, labelled, sex can be detrimental to one's creativity as well as how seriously people take you as a producer of consumable goods. The \"new mestiza\" way of thinking is illustrated in postcolonial feminism.\n\nAnzaldúa called for people of different races to confront their fears to move forward into a world that is less hateful and more useful. In \"La Conciencia de la Mestiza: Towards a New Consciousness,\" a text often used in women's studies courses, Anzaldúa insisted that separatism invoked by Chicanos/Chicanas is not furthering the cause but instead keeping the same racial division in place. Many of Anzaldúa's works challenge the status quo of the movements in which she was involved. She challenged these movements in an effort to make real change happen to the world rather than to specific groups. Scholar Ivy Schweitzer writes, \"her theorizing of a new borderlands or mestiza consciousness helped jump start fresh investigations in several fields -- feminist, Americanist [and] postcolonial.\"\n\nIn the same way that Anzaldúa often wrote that she felt that she could not be classified as only part of one race or the other, she felt that she possessed a multi-sexuality. When growing up, Anzaldúa expressed that she felt an \"intense sexuality\" towards her own father, animals, and even trees. She was attracted to and later had relationships with both men and women, although she identified herself as a lesbian in most of her writing. Anzaldúa wrote extensively about her queer identity and the marginalization of queer people, particularly in communities of color.\n\nAnzaldúa self-identifies in her writing as a feminist, and her major works are often associated with Chicana feminism and postcolonial feminism. Anzaldúa writes of the oppression she experiences specifically as a woman of color, as well as the restrictive gender roles that exist within the Chicano community. In \"Borderlands\", she also addresses topics such as sexual violence perpetrated against women of color.\n\n\nAdditionally, her work \"\" was recognized as one of the 38 best books of 1987 by \"Library Journal\" and 100 Best Books of the Century by both \"Hungry Mind Review\" and \"Utne Reader\".\n\nIn 2012, she was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the LGBT History Month.\n\nAnzaldúa died on May 15, 2004, at her home in Santa Cruz, California, from complications due to diabetes. At the time of her death, she was working toward the completion of her dissertation to receive her doctorate in Literature from the University of California, Santa Cruz. It was awarded posthumously in 2005.\n\nSeveral institutions now offer awards in memory of Anzaldúa.\n\nThe Chicana/o Latina/o Research Center (CLRC) at University of California, Santa Cruz offers the annual \"Gloria E. Anzaldúa Distinguished Lecture Award\" and \"The Gloria E. Anzaldúa Award for Independent Scholars and Contingent Faculty\" is offered annually by the American Studies Association. The latter \"...honors Anzaldúa's outstanding career as an independent scholar and her labor as contingent faculty, along with her groundbreaking contributions to scholarship on women of color and to queer theory. The award includes a lifetime membership in the ASA, a lifetime electronic subscription to American Quarterly, five years access to the electronic library resources at the University of Texas at Austin, and $500\".\n\nIn 2007, three years after Gloria Anzaldúa's death, the Society for the Study of Gloria Anzaldúa (SSGA) was established to gather scholars and community members who continue to engage Anzaldúa's work. The SSGA co-sponsors a conference – El Mundo Zurdo – every 18 months.\n\nThe Gloria E. Anzaldúa Poetry Prize is awarded annually, in conjunction with the Anzaldúa Literary Trust, to a poet whose work explores how place shapes identity, imagination, and understanding. Special attention is given to poems that exhibit multiple vectors of thinking: artistic, theoretical, and social, which is to say, political. First place is publication by Newfound, including 25 contributor copies, and a $500 prize.\n\nThe National Women's Studies Association honors Anzaldúa, a valued and long-active member of the organization, with the annual Gloria E. Anzaldúa Book Prize, which is designated for groundbreaking monographs in women's studies that makes significant multicultural feminist contributions to women of color/transnational scholarship.\n\nTo commemorate what would have been Anzaldúa's 75th birthday, on September 26, 2017 Aunt Lute Books published the anthology \"Imaniman: Poets Writing in the Anzaldúan Borderlands\" edited by ire'ne lara silva and Dan Vera with an introduction by United States Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera and featuring the work of 52 contemporary poets on the subject of Anzaldúa's continuing impact on contemporary thought and culture. On the same day, Google commemorated Anzaldúa's achievements and legacy through a Doodle in the United States.\n\nHoused at the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection at the University of Texas at Austin, the Gloria Evangelina Anzaldúa Papers, 1942-2004 contains over 125 feet of published and unpublished materials including manuscripts, poetry, drawings, recorded lectures, and other archival resources. AnaLouise Keating is one of the Anzaldúa Trust's trustees. Anzaldúa maintained a collection of figurines, masks, rattles, candles, and other ephemera used as altar (altares) objects at her home in Santa Cruz, California. These altares were an integral part of her spiritual life and creative process as a writer. The altar collection is presently housed by the Special Collections department of the University Library at the University of California, Santa Cruz.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "3934238", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3934238", "title": "Hans Achterhuis", "text": "Hans Achterhuis\n\nHerman Johan \"Hans\" Achterhuis (born September 1, 1942, Hengelo) is Professor Emeritus in Systematic Philosophy at the University of Twente, The Netherlands and one of the country's foremost philosophers. For now his research concerns particularly social and political philosophy and philosophy of technology.\n\nHis list of publications shows a great scope (in fields of medical care, labour, third-world-philosophy). In 1967 he took his doctoral degree on Albert Camus.\n\nHis latest books handle the topics of utopianism (‘De erfenis van de utopie’, ‘The Legacy of Utopia’) and the tension between morality and politics in relation to the Kosovo War (“Politiek van Goede bedoelingen’, ‘Policy of good intentions’). He is co-author of the volume American Philosophy of Technology; The Empirical Turn. This work includes contributions on Albert Borgmann, Hubert Dreyfus, Andrew Feenberg, Donna Haraway, Don Ihde and Langdon Winner.\n\nHis ideas add up to a philosophy of things (objects) and a plea for a morality of machines. Rather than being morally neutral, things guide our behaviour (barriers in the subway forcing us to buy a ticket). This is why they are capable of exerting moral pressure that is much more effective than imposing sanctions or trying to reform the way people think. Utopia has been superseded but the world can still be improved, if we take seriously our moral ties to the machines and devices that surround us.\nIn 2011 Achterhuis was chosen as the first Philosopher Laureate of the Netherlands. This honorary title was an initiative of the Magazine Filosofie, and the Philosophy Month Foundation (Stichting Maand van de Filosofie), together with the newspaper Trouw. The person is chosen by a group of journalists and academics. The aim of the initiative is to allow a philosophy heavyweight to speak in the media, to place news events in a broader context. In 2013 Achterhuis was succeeded as Philosopher Laureate by René Gude (Soerabaja, 2 March 1957 – Amsterdam, 13 March 2015).\n\n"}

{"id": "7124412", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7124412", "title": "Illegal immigration", "text": "Illegal immigration\n\nIllegal immigration refers to the migration of people into a country in ways that violate the immigration laws of that country, or the remaining in a country of people who no longer have the legal right to remain. \n\nIllegal immigration, as well as immigration in general, is overwhelmingly financially upward, from a poorer to a richer country. Living in another country illegally includes a variety of restrictions, as well as the risk of being detained and deported or of facing other sanctions.\n\nAsylum seekers who were denied asylum may face impediment to expulsion, for example if the home country refuses to receive the person or if new asylum reasons occur after the decision. In some countries or cases, these people are considered as illegal immigrants, and in others, they may get a temporary residence permit, for example with reference to the principle of non-refoulement in the international Refugee Convention. The European Court of Human Rights, referring to the European Convention on Human Rights, has shown in a number of indicative judgments that there are enforcement barriers to expulsion to certain countries, for example due to the risk of torture.\n\nThere have been campaigns in many countries since 2007 discouraging the use of the term \"illegal immigrant\". They are generally based on the argument that the act of immigrating illegally does not make the people themselves illegal, but rather they are \"people who have immigrated illegally\". In the United States, a \"Drop the I-Word\" campaign was launched in 2010 advocating for the use of terms such as undocumented immigrants or unauthorized immigrants when referring to the foreign nationals who reside in a country illegally.\n\nNews associations that have discontinued or discourage the use of the adjective \"illegal\" to describe nouns that describe people include the US Associated Press, UK Press Association, European Journalism Observatory, European Journalism Centre, Association of European Journalists, Australian Press Council, and Australian Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance. Related terms that describe actions are not similarly discouraged by these campaigns. For example, Associated Press continues to use the term \"illegal immigration\" to describe the action of entering or residing in a country illegally.\n\nIn contrast, in some contexts the term \"illegal immigrants\" is shortened, often pejoratively, to \"illegals\".\n\nOn the other hand, the term undocumented has been cited by The New York Times, as a \"term preferred by many immigrants and their advocates, but it has a flavor of euphemism and should be used with caution outside quotation\". Newsweek questions the use of the phrase 'undocumented immigrants' as a method of euphemistic framing, namely, \"a psychological technique that can influence the perception of social phenomena\". Newsweek also suggests that persons who enter a country unlawfully cannot be entirely \"undocumented\" because they \"just lack the certain specific documents for legal residency and employment. Many have drivers licenses, debit cards, library cards, and school identifications which are useful documents in specific contexts but not nearly so much for immigration.\" For example, in the U.S., youths brought into the country illegally are granted access to public K-12 education and benefits regardless of citizenship status, so the youths are documented for educational purposes, and are not entirely undocumented. U.S. immigration laws do use the phrase illegal immigrant at least in some contexts.\n\nA related term, irregular migration, is sometimes used e.g. by the International Organization for Migration, but it describes a somewhat wider concept which also includes illegal emigration.\n\nIn the U.S., the term illegal alien is used in many statutes and elsewhere (e.g., court cases, executive orders). U.S. law also uses the term \"unauthorized alien\", but U.S. law provides no overarching explicit definition of the term illegal alien.\n\nOverstaying a visa is a civil violation handled by immigration court, while entering (including re-entering) the US without approval from an immigration officer is a crime: specifically a misdemeanor on the first offense. Illegal reentry after deportation is a federal offense. This is the distinction between the larger group referred to as unauthorized immigrants and the smaller subgroup referred to as criminal immigrants.\n\nResearch on the economic effects of illegal immigration is scant but existing studies suggest that the effects can be positive for the native population, and for public coffers. A 2015 study shows that \"increasing deportation rates and tightening border control weakens low-skilled labor markets, increasing unemployment of native low-skilled workers. Legalization, instead, decreases the unemployment rate of low-skilled natives and increases income per native.\" Studies show that legalization of illegal immigrants would boost the U.S. economy; a 2013 study found that granting amnesty to illegal immigrants would raise their incomes by a quarter (increasing U.S. GDP by approximately $1.4 trillion over a ten-year period), and a 2016 study found that \"legalization would increase the economic contribution of the unauthorized population by about 20%, to 3.6% of private-sector GDP.\" A 2018 National Bureau of Economic Research paper found that undocumented immigrants to the United States \"generate higher surplus for US firms relative to natives, hence restricting their entry has a depressing effect on job creation and, in turn, on native labor markets.\" \n\nA paper by Spanish economists found that upon legalizing the undocumented immigrant population in Spain, the fiscal revenues increased by around €4,189 per newly legalized immigrant. The paper found that the wages of the newly legalized immigrants increased after legalization, some low-skilled natives had worse labor market outcomes and high-skilled natives had improved labor market outcomes.\n\nAccording to economist George Borjas, immigrants may have caused the decline of real wages of US workers without a high school degree by 9% between 1980 and 2000 due to increased competition. Other economists, such as Gordon Hanson and Douglas Massey, criticized this view, and said that it is oversimplified and does not account for contradictory evidence, such as the low net illegal immigration from Mexico to the US before the 1980s despite significant economic disparity. Douglas Massey argues that the developed countries need unskilled immigrant labor to fill undesirable jobs which citizens do not seek regardless of wages. Massey argues that this refutes claims that undocumented immigrants are \"lowering wages\" or stealing jobs from native-born workers, and that it instead shows that undocumented immigrants \"take jobs that no one else wants.\"\n\nSince the decline of working class blue-collar jobs in manufacturing and industry, younger native-born generations have acquired higher education. In the US, only 12% of the labor force has less than a high school education, but 70% of illegal workers from Mexico lack a high school degree. The majority of new blue-collar jobs qualify as Massey's \"underclass\" work, and suffer from unreliability, subservient roles and, critically, a lack of potential for advancement. These \"underclass\" jobs, which have a disproportionate number of undocumented immigrants, include harvesting crops, unskilled labor in landscaping and construction, house-cleaning, and maid and busboy work in hotels and restaurants. However, as even these \"underclass\" jobs have higher relative wages than those in home countries they are still attractive for undocumented immigrants and since many undocumented immigrants often anticipate working only temporarily in the destination country, the lack of opportunity for advancement is seen by many as less of a problem. Support for this claim can be seen in a Pew Hispanic Center poll of over 3,000 undocumented immigrants from Mexico in the US, which found that 79% would voluntarily join a temporary worker program that allowed them to work legally for several years but then required them to leave. From this it is assumed that the willingness to take undesirable jobs is what gives undocumented immigrants their employment. Evidence for this may be seen in the average wages of illegal day laborers in California, which was between $10 and $12 per hour according to a 2005 study, and the fact that this was higher than many entry-level white collar or service jobs. Entry-level white collar and service jobs offer advancement opportunities only for people with work permits and citizenship.\n\nResearch indicates that the advantage to firms employing undocumented immigrants increases as more firms in the industry do so, further increases with the breadth of a firm's market, and also with the labor intensity of the firm's production process. However, the advantage decreases with the skill level of the firm's workers, meaning that illegal immigrants do not provide as much competitive advantage when a high-skilled workforce is required.\n\nIn recent years, developing countries have pursued the benefits of globalization by adopting measures to liberalize trade. But rapid opening of domestic markets may lead to displacement of large numbers of agricultural or unskilled workers, who are more likely to seek employment and a higher quality of life by illegal immigration.\n\nUndocumented immigrants are not impoverished by standards of their home countries. The poorest classes in a developing country may lack the resources needed to mount an attempt to cross illegally, or the connections to friends or family already in the destination country. Studies from the Pew Hispanic Center have shown that the education and wage levels of illegal Mexican immigrants in the US are around the median for Mexico and that they are not a suitable predictor of one's choice to immigrate.\n\nOther examples do show that increases in poverty, especially when associated with immediate crises, can increase the likelihood of illegal migration. The 1994 economic crisis in Mexico, subsequent to the start of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), was associated with widespread poverty and a lower valuation for the peso relative to the dollar. It also marked the start of a massive swell in Mexican immigration, in which net illegal migration to the US increased every year from the mid-1990s until the mid-2000s.\n\nThere are also examples where natural disasters and overpopulation can amplify poverty-driven migration flows.\n\nPopulation growth that exceeds the carrying capacity of an area or environment results in overpopulation. Virginia Abernethy notes that immigration is a road that provides a \"relief valve\" to overpopulation that stops a population from addressing the consequences of its overpopulation and that exports this overpopulation to another location or country. Overpopulation and its consequences is a bigger issue in developing countries.\n\nSome undocumented immigrants seek to live with loved ones, such as a spouse or other family members.\n\nHaving family who have immigrated or being from a community with many immigrants is a much better predictor of one's choice to immigrate than poverty. Family reunification visas may be applied for by legal residents or naturalized citizens to bring their family members into a destination state legally, but these visas may be limited in number and subject to yearly quotas. This may result in family members entering illegally in order to reunify. From studying Mexican migration patterns, Douglas Massey finds that the likelihood that a Mexican national will emigrate illegally to the US increases dramatically if they have one or more family members already residing in the United States, legally or illegally.\n\nUnauthorised arrival into another country may be prompted by the need to escape civil war or repression in the country of origin. However, somebody who flees such a situation is in most countries under no circumstances an undocumented immigrant. If victims of forced displacement apply for asylum in the country they fled to and are granted refugee status they have the right to remain permanently. If asylum seekers are not granted some kind of legal protection status, then they may have to leave the country, or stay as illegal immigrants.\n\nAccording to the 1951 Refugee Convention refugees should be exempted from immigration laws and should expect protection from the country they entered. It is, however, up to the countries involved to decide if a particular immigrant is a refugee or not, and hence whether they are subject to the immigration controls. Furthermore, countries that did not sign the 1951 Refugee Convention or do not attempt to follow its guidelines are likely to consider refugees and asylum seekers as illegal immigrants.\n\nIn a 2012 news story, the \"CSM\" reported, \"The estimated 750,000 Rohingya, one of the most miserable and oppressed minorities in the world, are deeply resentful of their almost complete absence of civil rights in Myanmar. In 1982, the military junta stripped the Rohingya of their Myanmar citizenship, classing them as illegal immigrants and rendering them stateless.\"\n\nIn some countries, people born on national territory (henceforth not \"immigrants\") do not automatically obtain the nationality of their birthplace, and may have no legal title of residency.\n\nAside from the possibility that they may be intercepted and deported, illegal immigrants also face other problems.\n\nIllegal immigrants usually have no or very limited access to public health systems, proper housing, education and banks. Some immigrants forge identity documents to get the access.\n\nAfter the end of the legal international slave trade by the Europeans and the United States in the early 19th century, the illegal importation of slaves has continued, albeit at much reduced levels. For example, research at San Diego State University estimates that there are 2.4 million victims of human trafficking among illegal Mexican immigrants in the United States. Although not as common as in Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America, some women are smuggled into the United States and Canada.\n\nPeople have been kidnapped or tricked into slavery to work as laborers, after entering the country, for example in factories. Those trafficked in this manner often face additional barriers to escaping slavery, since their status as undocumented immigrants makes it difficult for them to gain access to help or services. For example, Burmese women trafficked into Thailand and forced to work in factories or as prostitutes may not speak the language and may be vulnerable to abuse by police due to their undocumented immigrant status.\n\nIn some regions, people that are still en route to their destination country are also sometimes kidnapped, for example for ransom. In some instances, they are also tortured, raped, and killed if the requested ransom does not arrive. One case in point are the Eritrean migrants that are en route to Israel. A large number of them are captured in north Sinai (Egypt) and Eastern Sudan and held in the buildings in north Sinai.\n\nSome people forced into sexual slavery face challenges of charges of illegal immigration.\n\nSince the fall of the Iron Curtain, Western Europe is being confronted with a serious problem related to the sexual exploitation of undocumented immigrants (especially from Eastern Europe), for the purpose of prostitution.\n\nIn the United States human trafficking victims often pass through the porous border with Mexico. In an effort to curb the spread of this affliction, California Attorney General Kamala Harris and Mexico Attorney General Marisela Morales Ibáñez signed an accord in 2012 to expand prosecutions of criminals typically members of transnational gangs who engage in the trafficking of human beings between the two countries.\n\nMost countries have laws requiring workers to have proper documentation, often intended to prevent or minimize the employment of undocumented immigrants. However the penalties against employers are often small and the acceptable identification requirements vague, ill-defined and seldom checked or enforced, making it easy for employers to hire illegal labor. Where the minimum wage is several times the prevailing wage in the home country, employers sometimes pay less than the legal minimum wage or have unsafe working conditions, relying on the reluctance of illegal workers to report the violations to the authorities.\n\nThe search for employment is central to illegal international migration. According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, undocumented immigrants in the United States often work in dangerous industries such as agriculture and construction. A recent study suggests that the complex web of consequences resulting from illegal immigrant status limits illegal workers' ability to stay safe at work. In addition to physical danger at work, the choice to immigrate for work often entails work-induced lifestyle factors which impact the physical, mental and social health of immigrants and their families.\n\nEach year there are several hundred deaths along the U.S.–Mexico border of immigrants crossing the border illegally. Death by exposure occurs in the deserts of Southwestern United States during the hot summer season. In 2016 there were approximately 8,000 migrant deaths, with about 63% of deaths occurring within the Mediterranean.\n\nImmigrants from countries that do not have automatic visa agreements, or who would not otherwise qualify for a visa, often cross the borders illegally in some areas like the United States–Mexico border, the Mona Channel between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, the Strait of Gibraltar, Fuerteventura, and the Strait of Otranto. Because these methods are illegal, they are often dangerous. Would-be immigrants have been known to suffocate in shipping containers, boxcars, and trucks, sink in shipwrecks caused by unseaworthy vessels, die of dehydration or exposure during long walks without water. An official estimate puts the number of people who died in illegal crossings across the U.S.–Mexican border between 1998 and 2004 at 1,954 (see immigrant deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border).\n\nHuman smuggling is the practice of intermediaries aiding undocumented immigrants in crossing over international borders in financial gain, often in large groups. Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A human smuggler will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people.\n\nTypes of notorious human smugglers include Snakehead gangs present in mainland China (especially in Fujian) that smuggle laborers into Pacific Rim states (making Chinatowns frequent centers of illegal immigration) and \"coyotes\", who smuggle undocumented immigrants to the Southwestern United States and have been known to abuse or even kill their passengers. Sometimes undocumented immigrants are abandoned by their human traffickers if there are difficulties, often dying in the process. Others may be victims of intentional killing.\n\nMany undocumented immigrants are migrants who originally arrive in a country lawfully but overstay their authorized residence (overstaying a visa). For example, most of the estimated 200,000 illegal immigrants in Canada (perhaps as high as 500,000) are refugee claimants whose refugee applications were rejected but who have not yet been expelled from the country.\n\nAnother example is formed by children of foreigners born in countries observing \"jus soli\" (\"right of territory\"), such as was the case in France until 1994 and in Ireland until 2005. In these countries, it was possible to obtain French or Irish nationality (respectively) solely by being born in France before 1994 or in Ireland before 2005 (respectively). At present, a French born child of foreign parents does not automatically obtain French nationality until residency duration conditions are met. Since 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland does not automatically acquire Irish nationality unless certain conditions are met.\n\nAnother method is by entering into a sham marriage where the marriage is contracted into for purely immigration advantage by a couple who are not in a genuine relationship. Common reasons for sham marriages are to gain immigration, (this is called immigration fraud) residency, work or citizenship rights for one or both of the spouses, or for other benefits.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, those who arrange, participate in, or officiate over a sham marriage may be charged with a number of offenses, including assisting unlawful immigration and conspiracy to facilitate breach of immigration law.\n\nThe United States has a penalty of a $250,000 fine and five-year prison sentence for such arrangements. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department say that they do not have accurate numbers on the rate of attempted marriage fraud. In the 2009 fiscal year, 506 of the 241,154 petitions filed were denied for suspected fraud, a rate of 0.2%; seven percent were denied on other grounds.\n\nIn 2007 around 44,000 Congolese were forced to leave Angola. Since 2004, more than 400,000 illegal immigrants, almost all from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have been expelled from Angola.\n\nOfficial government sources put the number of visa overstayers in Australia at approximately 50,000. This has been the official number of illegal immigrants for about 25 years and is considered to be low. Other sources have placed it at up to 100,000, but no detailed study has been completed to quantify this number, which could be significantly higher.\n\nOn 1 June 2013, the \"Migration Amendment (Reform of Employer Sanctions) Act 2013\" commenced. This new law puts the onus on businesses to ensure that their employees maintain the necessary work entitlements in Australia. The new legislation also enables the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship to levy infringement notices against business (AUD $15,300) and individual (AUD $3,060) employers on a strict liability basis – meaning that there is no requirement to prove fault, negligence or intention.\n\nThere are about 1.2 million Indians living in Bangladesh illegally as of 2014. The illegal migrants are mainly from the poorest states in India including West Bengal, Meghalaya, Assam and Manipur, which surround Bangladesh. They illegally immigrate to Bangladesh in search of jobs in the metropolitan hubs and a better standard of living. Bangladesh is fifth among the nations sending highest remittances to India. Indians working in Bangladesh sent more than $3.7 billion back to India in 2012.\n\nThere is a significant number of Burmese illegal immigrants in Bangladesh. As of 2012, the Bangladesh government estimated about 500,000 illegal Burmese immigrants living across Bangladesh.\n\nImmigration in Bhutan by Nepalese settlers (Lhotshampa) began slowly towards the end of the 19th century. The government passed the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1985 to clarify and try to enforce the Bhutanese Citizenship Act 1958 to control the flood of illegal immigration. Those individuals who could not provide proof of residency prior to 1958 were adjudged to be undocumented immigrants. In 1991 and 1992, Bhutan expelled roughly 139,110 ethnic Nepalis, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since. The United States has offered to resettle 60,000 of the 107,000 Bhutanese refugees of Nepalese origin now living in U.N. refugee camps in Nepal. The Bhutanese government, even today, has not been able to sort the problem of giving citizenship to those people who are married to Bhutanese, even though they have been in the country for 40 years.\n\nBrazil has long been part of international migration routes. In 2009, the government estimated the number if illegal immigrants at about 200,000 people; a Catholic charity working with immigrants said there were 600,000 illegal immigrants (75,000 of which from Bolivia). That same year, the Brazilian Parliament approved an amnesty, opening a six-month window for all foreigners to seek legalization irrespective of their previous standing before the law. Brazil had last legalized all immigrants in 1998; bilateral deals, one of which promoted the legalization of all reciprocal immigrants with Bolivia to date, signed in 2005, are also common.\n\nIllegal immigrants in Brazil enjoy the same legal privileges as native Brazilians regarding access to social services such as public education and the Brazilian public healthcare system. A Federal Police operation investigated Chinese immigrants who traveled through six countries before arriving in São Paulo to work under substandard conditions in the textile industry.\n\nAfter signing the 2009 amnesty bill into law, President Lula da Silva said, in a speech, that \"repression and intolerance against immigrants will not solve the problems caused by the economic crisis\", thereby also harshly criticizing the \"policy of discrimination and prejudice\" against immigrants in developed nations.\n\nAn October 2009 piece from O Globo, quoting a UNDP study, estimates the number of undocumented immigrants at 0.7 million, and points out to a recent wave of xenophobia among the general populace.\n\nThere is no credible information available on illegal immigration in Canada. Estimates range between 35,000 and 120,000 illegal immigrants in Canada. James Bissett, a former head of the Canadian Immigration Service, has suggested that the lack of any credible refugee screening process, combined with a high likelihood of ignoring any deportation orders, has resulted in tens of thousands of outstanding warrants for the arrest of rejected refugee claimants, with little attempt at enforcement. Refugee claimants in Canada do not have to attempt re-entry to learn the status of their claim. A 2008 report by the Auditor General Sheila Fraser stated that Canada has lost track of as many as 41,000 illegal immigrants. This number was predicted to increase drastically with the expiration of temporary employer work permits issued in 2007 and 2008, which were not renewed in many cases because of the shortage of work due to the recession.\n\nChile has recently become a new pole of attraction for illegal immigrants, mostly from neighboring Argentina, Peru and Bolivia but also Ecuador, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, Venezuela and Haiti. According to the 2002 national census, Chile's foreign-born foreign population has increased by 75% since 1992.\n\nChina is building a security barrier along its border with North Korea to prevent the defectors or refugees from North Korea. Also, many illegal immigrants from Mongolia have tried to make it to China. There might be as many as 100,000 Africans in Guangzhou, mostly illegal overstayers. To encourage people to report foreigners living illegally in China, the police are giving a 100 yuan reward to whistle blowers whose information successfully leads to an expulsion.\n\nThe Dominican Republic is a nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti. An estimated 1,000,000 Haitians live and work in the Dominican Republic, which has a total population of about ten million. The percentage of Haitians that have illegally immigrated to the Dominican Republic is not accurately known, and \"many Dominicans have come to resent the influx of lower-paid workers from across the border and have sought to make their country less hospitable to noncitizens.\"\n\nIt is estimated that several tens of millions of illegal immigrants live in India. Precise figures are not available, but the numbers run in tens of millions, at least 10 million are from Bangladesh, others being from Pakistan, Afghanistan and others. According to the Government of India, there at least 20 million illegal immigrants from Bangladesh alone. This makes India the country with the largest number of illegal immigrants in the world. During the Bangladesh Liberation War at least 10 million Bangladeshis crossed into India illegally to seek refuge from widespread rape and genocide. According to Indian Home Ministry, at least 1.4 Million Bangladeshi crossed over into India in the last decade alone. Samir Guha Roy of the Indian Statistical Institute called these estimates \"motivatedly exaggerated\". After examining the population growth and demographic statistics, Roy instead states that a significant numbers of internal migration is sometimes falsely thought to be immigrants. An analysis of the numbers by Roy revealed that on average around 91000 Bangladeshi nationals might have crossed over to India every year during the years 1981–1991 but how many of them were identified and pushed back is not known. It is possible that a large portion of these illegal immigrants returned on their own to their place of origin.\n\nAccording to a pro-Indian scholar, the trip to India from Bangladesh is one of the cheapest in the world, with a trip costing around Rs.2000 (around $30 US), which includes the fee for the \"Tour Operator\". As Bangladeshis are cultural similar to the Bengali people in India, they are able to pass off as Indian citizens and settle down in any part of India to establish a future., for a very small price. This false identity can be bolstered with false documentation available for as little as Rs.200 ($3 US) can even make them part of the vote bank.\nIndia is constructing barriers on its eastern borders to combat the surge of migrants. The Indo-Bangladeshi barrier is 4,000 km (2,500 mi) long. Presently, India is constructing a fence along the border to restrict illegal traffic from Bangladesh. This obstruction will virtually isolate Bangladesh from India. The barrier's plan is based on the designs of the Israeli West Bank barrier and will be 3.6 m (11.8 ft) high. The stated aim of the fence is to stop infiltration of terrorists, prevent smuggling, and end illegal immigration from Bangladesh.\n\nSince late April 2007, the Iranian government has forcibly deported back Afghans living and working in Iran to Afghanistan at a rate between 250,000 and 300,000 per year. The forceful evictions of the refugees, who lived in Iran and Pakistan for nearly three decades, are part of the two countries' larger plans to repatriate all Afghan refugees within a few years. Iran said that it would send 1,000,000 by March 2008, and Pakistan announced that all 2,400,000 Afghan refugees, most living in camps, must return home by 2009. Aimal Khan, a political analyst at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute in Islamabad said it would be \"disastrous\" for Afghanistan.\n\nTens of thousands of migrants, mostly from Sudan and Eritrea, had crossed the Israeli border between 2009 and 2012. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that \"This phenomenon is very grave and threatens the social fabric of society, our national security and our national identity.\" In May 2012, Israel introduced a law which would allow illegal immigrants to be detained for up to three years, a measure that the Interior Ministry intended to stem the flow of Africans entering Israel across the desert border with Egypt. As a result, completing a barrier along the border with Egypt, illegal immigration from Africa decreased by over 99%.\n\nIsrael faces substantial illegal immigration of Arab workers from the Palestinian Authority territories, a migration that includes both workers seeking employment, and homosexuals escaping the social opprobrium of Arab society.\n\nBefore the Libyan civil war, Libya was home to a large illegal Sub-Saharan African population which numbers as much as 2,000,000. The mass expulsion plan to summarily deport all illegal foreigners was announced by then-current Libyan leader Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi in January 2008, \"No resident without a legal visa will be excluded.\"\n\nThere are an estimated 800,000 illegal immigrants in Malaysia. In January 2009, Malaysia banned the hiring of foreign workers in factories, stores and restaurants to protect its citizens from mass unemployment amid the late 2000s recession. An ethnic Indian Malaysian was recently sentenced to whipping and 10 months in prison for hiring six illegal immigrants at his restaurant. \"I think that after this, Malaysian employers will be afraid to take in foreign workers (without work permits). They will think twice\", said immigration department prosecutor Azlan Abdul Latiff. \"This is the first case where an employer is being sentenced to caning\", he said. Illegal immigrants also face caning before being deported.\n\nIn the first six months of 2005, more than 120,000 people from Central America were deported, as compared to 2002, when for the entire year, only 130,000 were deported. People of Han Chinese origin pay about $5,500 to smugglers to be taken to Mexico from Hong Kong. It is estimated that 2.4% of rejections for work permits in Mexico correspond to Chinese citizens. In a 2010 news story, \"USA Today\" reported, \"... Mexico's Arizona-style law requires local police to check IDs. And Mexican police freely engage in racial profiling and routinely harass Central American migrants, say immigration activists.\"\n\nMany women from Eastern Europe, Asia, and Central and South America take jobs at table dance establishments in large cities. The National Institute of Migration (INM) in Mexico raids strip clubs and deports foreigners who work without proper documentation. In 2004, the INM deported 188,000 people at a cost of US$10 million.\n\nIn September 2007, Mexican President Calderón harshly criticized the United States government for the crackdown on illegal immigrants, saying it has led to the persecution of immigrant workers without visas. \"I have said that Mexico does not stop at its border, that wherever there is a Mexican, there is Mexico\", he said. However, Mexico has also deported US citizens, deporting 2,000 cases in 2015 and 1,243 in 2014.\n\nIllegal immigration of Cubans through Cancún tripled from 2004 to 2006. In October 2008, Mexico tightened its immigration rules and agreed to deport Cubans who use the country as an entry point to the US. It also criticized US policy that generally allows Cubans who reach US territory to stay. Cuban Foreign Minister said the Cuban-Mexican agreement would lead to \"the immense majority of Cubans being repatriated.\"\n\nIn 2008, Nepal's Maoist-led government has initiated a major crackdown against Tibetan exiles with the aim to deport to China all Tibetans living illegally in the country. Tibetans started pouring into Nepal after a failed anti-Chinese uprising in Tibet in 1959.\n\nAs of 2005, 2.1% of the population of Pakistan had foreign origins, however the number of immigrants population in Pakistan recently grew sharply. Immigrants from South Asia make up a growing proportion of immigrants in Pakistan. The five largest immigrant groups in Pakistan are in turn Afghans, Bangladeshi, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmens, Iranians, Indians, Sri Lankan, Burmese and Britons including a sizeable number of those of Pakistani origin. Other significant expatriate communities in the country are Armenians, Australians, Turks, Chinese, Americans, Filipinos, Bosnians and many others. Migrants from different countries of Arab world specially Egypt, Iraq, Palestine, Syria, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen are in thousands. Nearly all illegal migrants in Pakistan are Muslim refugees and they are accepted by the local population. There is no political support or legislation to deport these refugees from Pakistan.\n\nIt was estimated by Teresita Ang-See, a prominent leader and activist of the Chinese Filipino community, that by 2007, as much as 100,000 illegal immigrants from China are living in the Philippines, a tenth of the ethnic Chinese population. The latest influx has come in part because of Manila's move in 2005 to liberalise entry procedures for Chinese tourists and investors, a move that helped triple the number of Chinese visitors to 133,000 last year. Many of the new Chinese immigrants encounter hostility from many Filipinos, including Filipino-born Chinese, for being perceived as engaging in criminal activities and fraud.\n\nRussia experiences a constant flow of immigration. On average, 200,000 legal immigrants enter the country every year; about half are ethnic Russians from other republics of the former Soviet Union. In addition, there are an estimated 10–12 million illegal immigrants in the country. There has been a significant influx of ethnic Georgians, Armenians, Azerbaijanis, Tajiks, and Uzbeks into large Russian cities in recent years, which has been viewed very unfavorably by many citizens and contributed to nationalist sentiments.\n\nMany immigrant ethnic groups have much higher birth rates than native Russians, further shifting the balance. Some Chinese flee the overpopulation and birth control regulations of their home country and settle in the Far East and in southern Siberia. Russia's main Pacific port and naval base of Vladivostok, once closed to foreigners, today is bristling with Chinese markets, restaurants and trade houses. This has been occurring a lot since the Soviet collapse.\n\nIllegal border crossing is considered a crime, and captured illegal border crossers have been sentenced to prison terms. For example, \"Rossiyskaya Gazeta\" reported in October 2008 the case of a North Korean who was detained after illegally crossing the Amur River from China. Considered by Russian authorities an \"economic migrant\", he was sentenced to 6 months in prison and was to be deported to the country of his nationality after serving his sentence, even though he may now risk an even heavier penalty there. That was just one of the 26 cases year-to-date of illegal entrants, of various nationalities, receiving criminal punishment in Amur Oblast.\n\nIn 2004, Saudi Arabia began construction of a Saudi–Yemen barrier between its territory and Yemen to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out of the Kingdom. Anthony H. Cordesman labeled it a \"separation barrier.\" In February 2004, The Guardian reported that Yemeni opposition newspapers likened the barrier to the Israeli West Bank barrier, while The Independent wrote \"Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel's 'security fence' in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen\". Saudi officials rejected the comparison saying it was built to prevent infiltration and smuggling.\n\nThe Schengen Area is a multilateral agreement between 26 states in which they in most cases abolish the border control between themselves. These states include most of the EU countries, as well as the EEC countries Norway, Switzerland and Iceland. Any person who is physically inside any of the Schengen states will usually be able to travel to any other Schengen state without hindrance from the law enforcement, even if he or she has no legal right to enter another Schengen Area member state. A person who wishes to immigrate illegally to a Schengen Area member state may therefore find it more practical to enter it through another member state. According to a BBC report from 2012, over 80% of illegal immigrants entering the European Union pass through Greece.\n\nEU countries that are not members of the Schengen Agreement are still committed to allow lawful entry by citizens of EU countries; they may however exercise border control at their discretion. This typically presents a significant hindrance to persons who are trying to enter those countries illegally.\n\nCitizens within The EU is an economic and political partnership between 28 European countries that together cover much of the European continent . A citizen of an EU member state has the right to seek employment within any other member state . The Schengen Agreement does not regulate treatment of persons who enter the Schengen Area illegally. This is therefore left to the individual states, and other applicable international treaties and European case law. Illegal immigration to Schengen and to Europe in general was increasing sharply since approximately early 2014. The main causes for this increase are the conflicts that followed the Arab Spring; in particular, the civil war in Syria has driven millions of people from their homes, and the disintegration of the Libyan government removed a major barrier for the African migrants.\n\nIllegal immigration to some of the Schengen Area states might face different consideration depending on countries such as Bulgaria, France, Greece.\n\nIn 2013, 11,000 persons attempted to enter Bulgaria via its border with Turkey. Their aim is not believed by Bulgarian border officials to remain in Bulgaria, but to go to other European countries. In November 2013, Bulgaria started building a razor wire fence on its Turkey border, which was completed in 2015.\n\nChildren born to noncitizens in France are not immigrants themselves, but they are considered foreigners under French law, until they reach the age of 18, at which time they automatically become citizens. French citizenship is based in the idea of political unity; therefore, French citizenship may be more accessible than other EU countries, such as Germany and the UK. However, many French citizens feel that those who gain French citizenship should conform to the cultural aspects of French life. Foreigners can also become French citizens if they serve in the Foreign Legion.\n\nFrench law prohibits anyone from assisting or trying to assist \"the entry, movement, or irregular stay of a foreigner in France\". France has an Immigration Ministry (L'immigration, l'intégration, l'asile et le développement solidaire) which begun functioning in 2007 under President Sarkozy. The government seek to combat smugglers who profit financially from moving immigrants into, through, and out of France, according to the Immigration Minister, Éric Besson.\n\nIn 2014, Hungary registered 43,000 asylum seekers and 80,000 up to July 2015. In the summer of 2015, Hungary started building a 4m high fence along its 175 km border to neighbouring Serbia to keep out the tens of thousands illegal immigrants from the Middle East and migrants trying to reach the European Union. The border was sealed on 15 September 2015 and the fence was the following day attacked by refugees and defended by riot police.\n\nWith the Hungary-Serbia border closed, migrants then started heading to Croatia, but as Croatia led the migrants to the Hungary-Croatia border, Hungary then started the construction of a second fence along its border with Croatia on 18 September 2015.\n\nThe number of illegal immigrants in Norway was estimated to roughly 20 thousand in 2009, and to between 18 and 56 thousand in 2017. Estimates by organizations working with illegal migrants are much lower, between 5 thousand and 10 thousand in 2011.\n\nNo accurate estimates of the number of illegal migrants living in South Africa exist. Estimates that have been published vary widely. A 1996 Human Sciences Research Council study estimated that there were between 2.5 million and 4.1 million illegal migrants in the country. In their 2008/09 annual report, the South African Police Service stated: \"According to various estimates, the number of undocumented immigrants in South Africa may vary between three and six million people\". Other estimates have put the figure as high as 10 million. , Statistics South Africa's official estimate is of between 500,000 and one million illegal migrants. A large number of Zimbabweans have fled to South Africa as a result of instability in Zimbabwe, with many living as illegal migrants in South Africa. Sociologist Alice Bloch notes that migrants in South Africa have been the victims of xenophobia and violence, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nAccording to the Republic of Korea Immigration Service, as of 31 December 2014, there were 208,778 illegal immigrants, which is 11.6% of 1,797,618 total foreign nationals who resided in South Korea. The top 10 home countries of those illegal immigrants were China, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Mongolia, Indonesia, Uzbekistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Cambodia, respectively.\n\nSince the US-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, there are more refugees from Iraq. The United Nations estimates that nearly 2,200,000 Iraqis have fled the country since 2003, with nearly 100,000 fleeing to Syria and Jordan each month. Most ventured to Jordan and Syria, creating demographic shifts that have worried both governments. Refugees are mired in poverty as they are generally barred from working in their host countries.\n\nSyrian authorities worried that the new influx of refugees would limit the country's resources. Sources like oil, heat, water and electricity were said to be becoming scarcer as demand were rising. On 1 October 2007, news agencies reported that Syria reimposed restrictions on Iraqi refugees, as stated by a spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Under Syria's new rules, only Iraqi merchants, businessmen and university professors with visas acquired from Syrian embassies may enter Syria.\n\nTurkey receives many economic migrants from nearby countries such as Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia, but also from North Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Iraq War is thought to have increased the flow of illegal immigration into Turkey, and the global parties directly involved in the conflict have been accused of extending a less-helping hand than Turkey itself to resolve the precarious situation of immigrants stranded in passage.\n\nMany try to cross the English Channel from Calais to seek asylum or refugee status in Great Britain. Truck drivers can be fined up to €2,500 if illegal immigrants are found on board. The Home Office has its agents working alongside French police and immigration agents, to prevent unauthorized people from entering the zone. An area of Calais known as \"the Jungle\" had a police raid in September 2009 to control illegal immigration. The French also try to stop undocumented immigrants from entering France from the southern part of the country.\n\nNon-governmental organizations, such as Secours Catholique and the Red Cross provide food, showers, and shelter to sans papiers who gather waiting to cross the Channel.\n\nIn 1986, an Iranian man was sent back to Paris, from London, as he was unable to present any ID to British immigration officers. He stayed at the airport for nearly twenty years and his story was made into a film, The Terminal \n\nA 2012 study carried out by the University of Oxford's Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) has estimated that there were 120,000 irregular migrant children in the UK, of whom 65,000 were born in the UK to parents without legal status. According to the study these children are at risk of destitution, exploitation and social exclusion because of contradictory and frequently changing rules and regulations which jeopardize their access to healthcare, education, protection by the police and other public services.\n\nThe Home Office estimated that 4,000 to 10,000 applications a year to stay in the UK are made on the basis of a sham marriage. Many undocumented immigrants or asylum seekers have tried to enter the UK from France, by hiding inside trucks or trains.\n\nApproximately 11 million illegal immigrants were estimated to be living in the United States in 2006. Estimates from the Pew Hispanic Center show the number of illegal immigrants has declined to 11.1 million in March 2009, from a peak of 12 million in March 2007. The majority of the illegal immigrants are from Mexico. The issue of illegal immigration has long been controversial in the United States. In 2007, President George W. Bush called for Congress to endorse his guest worker proposal, stating that illegal immigrants took jobs that Americans would not take.\n\nThe Pew Hispanic Center notes that while the number of legal immigrants arriving has not varied substantially since the 1980s, the number of illegal immigrants has increased dramatically and, since the mid-1990s, has surpassed the number of legal immigrants. Penalties for employers of illegal immigrants, of $2,000–$10,000 and up to six months' imprisonment, go largely unenforced.\n\nPolitical groups like have formed to demand enforcement of immigration laws and secure borders. ALIPAC has also called for \"safe departure\" border checkpoints, free of criminal checks.\n\nIn a 2011 news story, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported, ... illegal immigrants in 2010 were parents of 5.5 million children, 4.5 million of whom were born in the U.S. and are citizens. Because illegal immigrants are younger and more likely to be married, they represented a disproportionate share of births—8% of the babies born in the U.S. between March 2009 and March 2010 were to at least one illegal immigrant parent.\n\nImmigration from Mexico to the United States has slowed in recent years. This has been attributed to the slowing of the U.S. economy, the buildup in security along the border and increased violence on the Mexican side of the Mexico-United States border.\n\nIn 2016, the Library of Congress, announced it would use \"noncitizens\" and \"unauthorized immigration\" rather than \"illegal aliens\" as a bibliographical term. It said the once common phrase had become offensive, and was not precise.\n\nIn 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed the US attorneys offices not to use the term \"undocumented immigrants\", but to instead refer to people as \"illegal aliens.\"\n\n\"See Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico#Illegal immigration\"\n\nAn estimated 200,000 Colombians have fled the Colombian civil war and sought safety in Venezuela. Most of them lack identity documents and this hampers their access to services, as well as to the labor market. The Venezuelan government has no specific policies on refugees.\n\n\n"}

It is based at the Isha Yoga Center near Coimbatore, India. The foundation offers yoga programs under the name of Isha Yoga. It has over 9 million volunteers.\n\nIsha Yoga is the masthead under which the Isha Foundation offers yoga programs. The word \"isha\" means \"the formless divine\".\n\nYoga classes are also conducted for corporate leaders to introduce them to what Sadhguru calls \"inclusive economics,\" to \"introduce a sense of compassion and inclusiveness into today's economic scenario\".\n\nA yoga course for the Indian national hockey team was conducted in 1996. Isha Foundation began conducting yoga programs in the United States in 1997 and, in 1998, yoga classes for life-term prisoners in Tamil Nadu prisons were initiated.\n\nThe foundation has established two ashrams: the Isha Yoga Center at the Velliangiri Mountains near Coimbatore and at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences at McMinnville, Tennessee.\n\nThe foundation regularly organises Mahasathsangs with Sadhguru in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where he gives discourses, conducts meditations and indulges in question-answer session with the masses. It also organises annual yatras to Mount Kailash and the Himalayas under the banners Kailash Manasarovar Sojourn and Himalayan Dhyan Yatra. The Kailash Sojourn led by Sadhguru is among the largest groups to make the trip to Kailash with 514 pilgrims making the journey in 2010.\n\nProject GreenHands (PGH) was established in 2004 as an environmental organization. Its activity is largely focused on Tamil Nadu. The organization received the Indira Gandhi Paryavaran Puraskar, the Government of India's environmental award in 2010. The organisation's activities include agroforestry, plant nurseries in schools, and tree-planting in urban centers such as Tiruchirappalli and Tiruppur.\n\nAction for Rural Rejuvenation (ARR) is a health and community-oriented program focuses on rural Tamil Nadu. It was established in 2003, and as of 2010, functioned in 4200 villages with a population 7 million.\n\nIsha Vidhya, an education initiative, aims to raise the level of education and literacy in rural India by providing quality English-language-based, computer-aided education to rural children. There are seven Isha Vidhya Schools in operation which educate around 3000 students.\n\n\"Rally For Rivers\" is a campaign launched by Isha Foundation in 2017 to tackle the scarcity of water across rivers in India and instill awareness about protecting rivers. Sadhguru launched the campaign on 3 September from Isha Yoga Center, Coimbatore. The campaign included a month-long, nationwide campaign. On 3 October, a river revitalization draft proposal was presented by Sadhguru to Narendra Modi. Six states signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) with Isha Foundation to plant trees along river banks. These states are Karnataka, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Gujarat.\n\n\n"}

Berthelot created a typology of sociological explanations, constituted by six logical schemas of intelligibility: causal, actancial, hermeneutic, structural, functionalist and dialectic. These types of explanation were the result of formalization of theory and arguments in the history of sociology.\n\nBerthelot, at the same time, criticized the epistemic relativism and defended the pluralism and openness in sociology, which makes him, in the contemporary debate on philosophy of social sciences, a rationalist and constructivist.

In the study of physicalism, Wilson first published on the 'proper subset strategy' for avoiding the worry that higher-level and their realizing lower-level properties would causally overdetermine their effects: properties are associated with sets of causal powers, and one property realizes another by the realized property being associated with a set of causal powers that is a proper subset of that associated with the realizing property; Wilson also argues that a nontrivial version of physicalism must be defined to exclude fundamental mental entities. Wilson's criticism of 'Grounding', understood as a generic relation of metaphysical dependence, problematizes a notion that has recently occupied center stage in metaphysics.\n"}

It was established in 1975 and focuses on natural and holistic living, yoga and relaxation, and spiritual retreats. Kalani is staffed by a core group of administrators, managers, and coordinators, plus over 100 volunteers from around the world. \n\nIn May 2018, during the 2018 lower Puna eruption, Kalani closed its operations, ostensibly temporarily, stating \"Recent earthquake activity on Kilauea’s south flank and lava eruptions in the Leilani Estates Subdivision are affecting air quality.\"\n\nKalani Oceanside Retreat, founded by Richard Koob and Earnest Morgan in 1975, is a non-profit retreat center, occupying a 120-acre compound located in the Puna District of the Big Island of Hawai'i. Kalani's mission is \"to provide a fun, safe, and educational retreat village which encourages ALOHA love for life in each person's own deepest way through participation in abundant nature, culture, and wellness experiences\". In keeping with the focus on nature, culture, and wellness, Kalani hosts diverse residential workshops; sponsors community arts and special events programs; provides lodging and meals for guests; oversees volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs; and houses a sustainable community of residents in an ecovillage.\n\nIn 1975, professional dancers Richard Koob and Earnest Morgan purchased the original 19-acre property, which they called Kalani Honua, translated as \"harmony of Heaven on Earth\". They based the center on their ideal of building a community to \"celebrate art, nature, health, and spirit\".\n\nIn the early years, Kalani was a small family operation. A conscious effort was made to include Hawaiian natives in the growing community. \n\nWorkshops and classes focused on topics such as Hawaiian culture, yoga, dance, painting, music, and creative writing. Workshop and course offerings increased as Kalani became known as a destination retreat center. Extensive volunteer, sabbatical, and visiting artist education programs were developed, and Kalani grew to be the largest and oldest retreat center in Hawaii.\n\nOver time, the Kalani campus was expanded to its current 120 acres, with purchase of the adjacent 94-acre Kalani Kai (\"Heavenly Sea\") parcel, and the 6-acre Kalani Mauka (\"Heavenly Uplands\") parcel, land specifically dedicated to building a sustainable agricultural community.\n\nKalani operates as a non-profit, 501(c)(3) charity through Kalani Honua, Inc., with a focus on nature, culture, and wellness.\n\nWorkshops offered at Kalani residential retreats focus on art and human development, holistic health, and Hawaiian culture, and include yoga, dance, and bodywork.\n\nKalani sponsors the Puna Community Arts Program, which consists of daily scheduled public offerings (more than 50 per week, many at no cost to the public, or by donation), such as yoga, meditation, qigong, dance, and alternative healing. The weekly Ecstatic Dance draws a large number of participants from the surrounding community. Special events consist of lectures, performances, symposia, festivals, dances, and other activities open to the general public, including the Puna Music Festival, Puna Culinary Festival, Illuminato, and the Hawaiʻi Yoga Festival.\n\nKalani oversees a residential volunteer education program, with more than 100 volunteers on site at a time. Volunteers are expected to contribute to the community through work in the kitchen, housekeeping, grounds, maintenance, or administrative office, and are encouraged to participate in daily life in the community, as well as workshops, classes, and Arts Program activities. Sabbatical and Visiting Artist programs are offered to encourage self-development and artistic endeavor, as well as to enrich the community.\n\nThe Hawaiʻi Massage School at Kalani offers full-time and part-time bodywork training, as well as an apprenticeship program approved by the Hawaiʻi State Massage Board to satisfy course requirements and prepare for the state certification examination.\n\nThe mission of Kalani emphasizes values of community, cultural and lifestyle diversity, and sustainable living. Community members include international visitors, locals, and people of Hawaiian descent, along with \"vegetarian, vegan, gay, straight or other, young or old\".\n\nAs of 2013, the annual economic impact of Kalani was estimated at nearly $10 million. The majority of Kalani's expenditures stay in the state, and contribute to the local economy of the Puna District, the poorest district in Hawaiʻi. All proceeds from guest stays go into Kalani’s community programming and services. According to Kalani founder Richard Koob \"[Kalani buys] as much produce as we can from local farmers, with many farmers growing specifically to supply Kalani’s needs\".\n\nKalani's facilities include simple guest lodging, a large community dining area (dining lanai), numerous buildings and rooms dedicated to workshops and classes, resident housing and camping areas, and a clothing optional pool and spa area. Grounds include gardens, open space, recreational areas, permaculture plantings, and natural areas.\n\nKalani's Wellness Department offers land and aquatic bodywork, including traditional Hawaiian LomiLomi, Thai massage, and Watsu.\n\nKalani serves healthy buffet-style meals in a roofed patio known in Hawaii as a \"lanai\". The dining lanai is considered to play a central role in the community, described as a gathering place where one \"can experience the daily rhythms of assembly and departure reminiscent of ancient village life\". A guide to Kalani's cuisine describes the food as \"a Pacific fusion of local, Thai, Indian, Italian, and many other cuisines\".\n\nFor 38 years Richard Koob served as the Director of Kalani. Lester John (\"LJ\") Bates III was appointed as Kalani’s Executive Director in November 2012, and after a period of transition Richard Koob officially retired in July 2013. Richard continues as a Kalani Board Member and Director Emeritus, assisting with the realization of Kalani's second thirty-year plan. Kalani appointed a new Executive Director, Joel Tan, in April 2016.\n\nKalani operates with a small paid staff and a large volunteer workforce.

According to this view, justice demands that variations in how well off people are should be wholly determined by the responsible choices people make and not to differences in their unchosen circumstances. This expresses the intuition that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own.\n\nLuck egalitarians therefore distinguish between outcomes that are the result of brute luck (e.g. misfortunes in genetic makeup, or being struck by a bolt of lightning) and those that are the consequence of conscious options (such as career choice or fair gambles). Luck egalitarianism is intended as a fundamental normative idea that might guide our thinking about justice rather than as an immediate policy prescription. The idea has its origin in John Rawls' thought that distributive shares should not be influenced by arbitrary factors. Luck egalitarians disagree among themselves about the proper way to measure how well off people are (for instance, whether we should measure material wealth, psychological happiness or some other factor) and the related issue of how to assess the value of their resources.\n\nMany philosophers think that the term \"luck egalitarianism\" is a misnomer, because many so-called \"luck egalitarians\" (of the 'resourcist' strand at least) do not in fact want to equalize luck or eliminate uncertainty, but instead believe that individuals should be equal in the amount of resources they have when facing luck or uncertainty.\n\nThe position is controversial within some currents of egalitarian thought, and the philosopher Elizabeth S. Anderson has been a vocal critic of it — on the ground that, amongst other things, the fact that something is chosen does not necessarily make it acceptable. An example of this would be a robber offering someone the choice \"Your money or your life,\" which choice some theorists, including Thomas Hobbes (\"Leviathan\" XIV: \"Covenants Extorted by Feare are Valide\") have regarded as presumptively binding. She also claims that luck egalitarianism expresses a demeaning pity towards the disadvantaged, basing their claims to compensation not on equality but inferiority, and excludes many individuals from the social conditions of their freedom simply on the basis that it is judged to be their fault for losing them. Further, it involves the state making highly moralistic and intrusive judgements about the choices that individuals make, and seems to lead to very counter-intuitive conclusions: those who voluntarily enter jobs with higher-than-average risks, or who 'choose' to live in geographical locations prone to natural disasters may make no claim on others if they suffer as a result of it.\n\nSusan Hurley has argued that any attempt to ground egalitarianism in issues concerning luck and responsibility must fail, because there is no non-circular way of specifying an \"egalitarian\" baseline rather than any other baseline. For instance, a luck inegalitarian could believe that the baseline from which we should correct luck is one where huge inequalities exist. Without merely assuming equality, there seems to be no way of coming to prefer one approach over the other.\n\nGlobal luck egalitarianism is a view about distributive justice at the global level associated with cosmopolitan moral theory. It starts from the premise that it is a bad thing for some people to be worse off than others through no fault of their own and applies this intuition across borders. Global luck egalitarians characteristically believe that moral agents may have duties to mitigate the brute luck of distant others. Proponents of this school of thought are amongst others Simon Caney and arguably Charles Beitz; opponents, most of whom reject the above premise either in its entirety or with respect to inequalities in which one party's welfare is at least above some minimum level, include Robert Nozick.\n\nProminent advocates of luck egalitarianism have included Ronald Dworkin, Richard Arneson, Gerald Cohen, John Roemer, Eric Rakowski, and Kok-Chor Tan.\n\n\n"}

Moderate objectivism adheres to basic notions of the Natural Law Theory. W. D. Ross refers to these moderate objectivists' accounts of moral principles as “\"prima facie\" principles” which are valid rules of action that one should generally adhere to but, in cases of moral conflict, may be overridable by another moral principle, hence the moderation.\n\n\"Prima facie\" principles contain duties that are correlated with many ethical theories. Such duties include fidelity, fulfilling commitments, truth and promises; justice, giving people what they deserve; respect for freedom; beneficence, improving the conditions of others; non-injury; self-improvement, stemming from the possibility of improving one’s own condition with respect to virtue, intelligence, and happiness; non-parasitism, and most importantly reparation, the duty of making up for wrongful acts previously done to others. Ross believed that these duties are to be followed and remain with each person's thought processes of behavior because it is their moral obligation to do so. Also, \"prima facie\" principles prove the existence of ethical principles that are binding on rational beings.\n\nPojman, on the other hand created ten similar principles “necessary for the good life within a flourishing human community.” He refers to these principles as the “core morality.” These simple, common sense principles include such moral rules as:\n\nBoth \"prima facie\" and core morality are exceedingly similar unlike the ideas of objectivism and absolutism. As said before, absolutists pursue the notion of “do the act that is set and given and do nothing else regardless of the situation.” A good example of ethical absolutism is Kantian deontology.\n\nThe absolutist idea is one that is set in stone and there is no changing a single part or the whole theory would be paradoxical, conflicting with all the beliefs an absolutist has come to live by. A more moderate following would be the moderate objectivism because these objectivists are inclined to act according to the principle of benevolence. Understandably, absolutists initially made the choice to follow these strict, concrete ways, but when it comes to something that involves acts of vindictiveness there is no way a being of reason could go through with such an act; it would be completely immoral according to a moderate objectivist.\n\n"}
{"id": "19940393", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19940393", "title": "Natural morality", "text": "Natural morality\n\nNatural morality describes a form of morality that is based on how humans evolved, rather than a morality acquired from societal norms or religious teachings.\n\nCharles Darwin's theory of evolution is central to the modern conception of natural morality, although its roots go back at least to naturalism. \nCharles Darwin defends a naturalist approach to morality. In \"The Descent of Man\", he argues that moral behaviour has outgrown from animal tendency for empathy through evolution of morality. By comparing human and animal behavior through a naturalist approach, he concludes that moral sense is based on the species' sociability, notably altruism.\n\nIn Darwin's view, empathy lays as the foundation for our actions, as opposed to selfishness. He states that humans can generally distinguish between altruism (the \"high moral rules\") and selfishness (the \"low moral rules\"):\nDarwin suggests sympathy is at the core of sociability and is an instinctive emotion found in most social animals. The ability to recognize and act upon others' distress or danger, is a suggestive evidence of instinctive sympathy; common mutual services found among many social animals, such as hunting and travelling in groups, warning others of danger and mutually defending one another, are some examples of instinctive sympathy Darwin offers. He insists it must be sympathy that compels an individual to risk his or her own life for another from his community.\n\nDarwin suggests further that the role of acceptance of others acts as a guide for conduct; sympathy enables to obtain approval of others instead of rejection. Social animals, when separated from the herd, cannot endure solitude and oftentimes perish. Darwin argues social animals have a natural dislike for solitude, and states: \"solitary confinement is one of the severest punishments which can be inflicted.\"\n\nBecause of the instinctive nature of sympathy and its general recurrence among many social animals, Darwin deduces this emotional character must be inherited through natural selection. From a naturalist point of view, it is probable that instinctive sympathy was first developed for animals to thrive by living in society just as the pleasure of eating was first acquired to induce animals to eat. In this sense, morality is a crucial instinct for survival in social animals. As Darwin notes in \"The Descent of Man\":\n\nInstinctive altruism effectively enables individuals to guarantee survival of the group, which in turn will aid survival of the individual. In \"The Descent of Man\", Darwin notes:\n\nMankind is a social animal, and has inherited its moral traits through the evolution of morality. As Darwin notes, the moral difference between mankind and animals, however, is \"certainly one of degree and not of kind.\" Emotions such as remorse, regret or shame one may feel, stem from human's incessant reflection on past experiences and preoccupation with the judgement of others.\n\n\n"}

The name is short for Johann Sebastian Bach: New Edition of the Complete Works (Johann Sebastian Bach: Neue Ausgabe sämtlicher Werke). It is a historical-critical edition (German: \"historisch-kritische Ausgabe\") of Bach's complete works by the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute (Johann-Sebastian-Bach-Institut) in Göttingen and the Bach Archive (Bach-Archiv) in Leipzig,\n\nWhen Bach died most of his work was unpublished. The first complete edition of Bach's music was published in the second half of the nineteenth century by the Bach Gesellschaft (Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe, BGA). The second complete edition includes some discoveries made since 1900, but there are relatively few such scores. The significance of the NBE lies more in its incorporation of the latest scholarship. Although the NBE is an urtext edition rather than a facsimile edition, it includes many facsimiles of Bach manuscripts. \n\nIn 1950, the commemorations of the bicentennial of Bach's death in Göttingen and Leipzig led to the initiative to publish his complete works in a critical scientific edition. Musicologists such as Friedrich Blume, Max Schneider, and Heinrich Besseler, and sponsors such as Bernhard Sprengel and made the project possible, supported by the editor .\n\nThe Neue Bachgesellschaft recommended to pursue the project as a joint venture of musicologists in Göttingen, then West Germany, and Leipzig, then East Germany, in order to stress that the common cultural heritage was indivisible. The Bach Archive and the Johann Sebastian Bach Institute collaborated, their directors Werner Neumann and Alfred Dürr made the new edition their life's project. The publishers were Bärenreiter in Kassel, chosen in 1951 by the Federal Government, and from 1954 the Deutscher Verlag für Musik, a new publisher in Leipzig which was involved until the unification of Germany.\n\nInitially the duration of the edition was estimated as 15 to 20 years, but the scientific work with the sources required much more time than anticipated. The first volumes appeared in 1954. The edition was completed in June 2007.\n\nThe edition contains in eight series over 100 volumes of scores (Notenbände), each Score (Partitur) volume complemented with a Critical Commentary (Kritischer Bericht) volume. The ninth series contains Addenda (7 volumes), and furthermore there is a Supplement of 9 volumes (Supplementbände):\n\nEach Score volume contains a preface and a selection of facsimiles of its sources. In the Score volumes variants and fragments of compositions are published along with complete works. The Critical Commentary volumes describe the history and sources (manuscript sources, early editions), and their interdependence, for each composition, and discuss editorial issues.\n\nThe New Bach Edition presents a reliable version of Bach's music for both scientists and performers. Its strict philological methods were exemplary for critical scientific editions in the second half of the 20th century. \n\nIn preparation for the NBE, lost compositions were found, whereas some known compositions proved to be not Bach's works. The examination of the sources corrected the chronology of his compositions.\n\nThe second revised edition of the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, and the Bach-Digital website refer to the NBE volume and page number for every listed composition by Bach. In addition to listing the page number of the score, the Bach Digital website also mentions the page number where the composition is discussed in the corresponding Critical Commentary volume.\n\nIn February 2010 the Bach Archive and the publisher announced a revision of single volumes, in order to include new sources and findings. The first in this series of revisions was the Mass in B minor (updating the second volume of the NBE).\nApproximately 15 more volumes are planned, including Weimar cantatas (five works), the \"St John Passion\", the motets, the violin sonatas, the cello suites and others.\n\nIn 2001 the German Association of Music Publishers (\"Deutscher Musikverlegerverband\") awarded a special prize to the New Bach Edition in recognition of editorial achievement.\n\n\n"}

She wrote a work on the correct behaviour of women, two extracts of which are preserved by Stobaeus.\n\nAccording to Stobaeus, Phintys was the daughter of Callicrates, who is otherwise unknown. Holger Thesleff suggests that this Callicrates might be identified with Callicratidas, a Spartan general who died at the Battle of Arginusae. If so, this would make Phintys a Spartan, and date her birth to the late fifth century BC, and her floruit to the fourth century. I. M. Plant considers this emendation \"fanciful\". Iamblichus mentions Philtys in his list of female Pythagoreans; he says that she was from Croton and that her father was called Theophrius. I. M. Plant believes that Iamblichus' Philtys, though also a Pythagorean and similarly named, is distinct from Stobaeus' Phintys.\n\nTwo fragments attributed to Phintys are preserved in Stobaeus. However, not all scholars agree that the fragments are authentic: Lefkowitz and Fant argue that the works attributed to female Pythagoreans, including Phintys, were actually rhetorical exercises written by men. They are written in the Doric dialect, and amount to about 80 lines of prose. The language used dates to around the fourth century BC, although some features of it appear to be deliberate archaisms; it was likely actually composed in the third century BC, though a date as late as the second century AD was suggested by Friedrich Wilhelm in 1915. \n\nThe fragments discuss the differences between men and women, and argues for chastity as the most important virtue for women. She gives a series of ways that women ought to practice self-control, concluding that the most effective way is to only have sex with her husband in order to produce legitimate children. Along with her defence of women's chastity, Phintys argues that the practice of philosophy is appropriate for women as well as men.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "5611579", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=5611579", "title": "Pramana", "text": "Pramana\n\nPramana (Sanskrit: प्रमाण, ) literally means \"proof\" and \"means of knowledge\". It refers to epistemology in Indian philosophies, and is one of the key, much debated fields of study in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism, since ancient times. It is a theory of knowledge, and encompasses one or more reliable and valid means by which human beings gain accurate, true knowledge. The focus of Pramana is how correct knowledge can be acquired, how one knows, how one doesn't, and to what extent knowledge pertinent about someone or something can be acquired.\n\nAncient and medieval Indian texts identify six \"pramanas\" as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: perception (Sanskrit \"pratyakṣa),\" inference (\"anumāna\"), comparison and analogy (\"upamāna\"), postulation, derivation from circumstances (\"arthāpatti\"), non-perception, negative/cognitive proof (\"anupalabdhi\") and word, testimony of past or present reliable experts (\"Śabda\"). Each of these are further categorized in terms of conditionality, completeness, confidence and possibility of error, by each school of Indian philosophies.\n\nThe various schools of Indian philosophies vary on how many of these six are epistemically reliable and valid means to knowledge. For example, Carvaka school of Hinduism holds that only one (perception) is a reliable source of knowledge, Buddhism holds two (perception, inference) are valid means, Jainism holds three (perception, inference and testimony), while Mimamsa and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hinduism hold all six are useful and can be reliable means to knowledge. The various schools of Indian philosophy have debated whether one of the six forms of \"pramana\" can be derived from other, and the relative uniqueness of each. For example, Buddhism considers Buddha and other \"valid persons\", \"valid scriptures\" and \"valid minds\" as indisputable, but that such testimony is a form of perception and inference \"pramanas\".\n\nThe science and study of \"Pramanas\" is called \"Nyaya\".\n\n\"Pramāṇa\" literally means \"proof\" and is also a concept and field of Indian philosophy. The concept is derived from the Sanskrit root, \"prama\" (प्रमा) which means \"correct notion, true knowledge, basis, foundation, accurate notion\". Thus, the concept \"Pramana\" implies that which is a \"means of acquiring \"prama\" or certain, correct, true knowledge\".\n\n\"Pramāṇa\" forms one part of a trio of concepts, which describe the ancient Indian view on how knowledge is gained. The other two concepts are knower and knowable, each discussed in how they influence the knowledge, by their own characteristic and the process of knowing. The two are called \"Pramātŗ\" (प्रमातृ, the subject, the knower) and \"Prameya\" (प्रमेय, the object, the knowable).\n\nThe term \"Pramana\" is commonly found in various schools of Hinduism. In Buddhist literature, \"Pramana\" is referred to as \"Pramāṇavāda\". \"Pramana\" is also related to the Indian concept of \"Yukti\" (युक्ति) which means active application of epistemology or what one already knows, innovation, clever expedients or connections, methodological or reasoning trick, joining together, application of contrivance, means, method, novelty or device to more efficiently achieve a purpose. \"Yukti\" and \"Pramana\" are discussed together in some Indian texts, with \"Yukti\" described as active process of gaining knowledge in contrast to passive process of gaining knowledge through observation/perception. The texts on \"Pramana\", particularly by Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa and Advaita Vedanta schools of Hinduism, include in their meaning and scope \"Theories of Errors\", that is why human beings make error and reach incorrect knowledge, how can one know if one is wrong, and if so, how can one discover whether one's epistemic method was flawed, or one's conclusion (truth) was flawed, in order to revise oneself and reach correct knowledge.\n\nHinduism identifies six \"pramanas\" as correct means of accurate knowledge and to truths: \"Pratyakṣa\" (perception), \"Anumāṇa\" (inference), \"Upamāṇa\" (comparison and analogy), \"Arthāpatti\" (postulation, derivation from circumstances), \"Anupalabdhi\" (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof) and \"Śabda\" (word, testimony of past or present reliable experts). \n\nAn early Late Vedic text, Taittirīya Āraṇyaka (c. 9th–6th centuries BCE), lists \"four means of attaining correct knowledge\": \"smṛti\" (\"tradition\" or \"scripture\"), \"pratyakṣa\" (\"perception\"), \"aitihya\" (\"tradition\"), and \"anumāna\" (\"inference\").\n\nIn some texts such as by Vedvyasa, ten \"pramanas\" are discussed, Krtakoti discusses eight epistemically reliable means to correct knowledge. The most widely discussed \"pramanas\" are:\n\n\n\nDifferent schools of Hindu philosophy accept one or more of above \"pramanas\" as valid epistemology.\n\nCarvaka school accepted only one valid source of knowledge - perception. It held all remaining methods as outright invalid or prone to error and therefore invalid.\n\nEpistemologically, the Vaiśeṣika school considered the following as the only proper means of knowledge:\n\n\nAccording to the Sankhya, Yoga, and two sub-schools of Vedanta, the proper means of knowledge must rely on these three pramanas:\n\n\nThe Nyāya school accepts four means of obtaining knowledge (\"pramāṇa\"), viz., Perception, Inference, Comparison and Word.\n\n\nIn Mimamsa school of Hinduism linked to Prabhakara considered the following pramanas as proper:\n\nIn Advaita Vedānta, and Mimamsa school linked to Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, the following pramanas are accepted:\n\nPadmākara Translation Group (2005: p. 390) annotates that:\n\nStrictly speaking, pramana (\"tshad ma\") means \"valid cognition.\" In (Buddhism) practice, it refers to the tradition, principally associated with Dignāga and Dharmakīrti, of logic (\"rtags rigs\") and epistemology (\"blo rigs\").\nBuddhism accepts only two \"pramana\" (\"tshad ma\") as valid means to knowledge: Pratyaksha (\"mngon sum tshad ma\", perception) and Anumāṇa (\"rjes dpag tshad ma\", inference). Rinbochay adds that Buddhism also considers scriptures as third valid \"pramana\", such as from Buddha and other \"valid minds\" and \"valid persons\". This third source of valid knowledge is a form of perception and inference in Buddhist thought. Valid scriptures, valid minds and valid persons are considered in Buddhism as \"Avisamvadin\" (\"mi slu ba\", incontrovertible, indisputable). Means of cognition and knowledge, other than perception and inference, are considered invalid in Buddhism.\n\nIn Buddhism, the two most important scholars of pramāṇa are Dignāga and Dharmakīrti.\n\nDignāga and Dharmakīrti are usually categorized as expounding the view of the Sautrāntika tenets, though one can make a distinction between the Sautrāntikas Following Scripture (Tibetan: ལུང་གི་རྗེས་འབྲང་གི་མདོ་སྡེ་པ Wylie: lung gi rjes 'brang gi mdo sde pa) and the Sautrāntikas Following Reason (Tibetan: རིགས་པ་རྗེས་འབྲང་གི་མདོ་སྡེ་པ Wylie: rigs pa rjes 'brang gi mdo sde pa) and both these masters are described as establishing the latter. Dignāga's main text on this topic is the \"Pramāṇa-samuccaya\".\n\nThese two rejected the complex Abhidharma-based description of how in the Vaibhāṣika school and the Sautrāntika Following Scripture approach connected an external world with mental objects, and instead posited that the mental domain never connects directly with the external world but instead only perceives an aspect based upon the sense organs and the sense consciousnesses. Further, the sense consciousnesses assume the form of the aspect (Sanskrit: Sākāravāda) of the external object and what is perceived is actually the sense consciousness which has taken on the form of the external object. By starting with aspects, a logical argument about the external world as discussed by the Hindu schools was possible. Otherwise their views would be so different as to be impossible to begin a debate. Then a logical discussion could follow.\n\nThis approach attempts to solve how the material world connects with the mental world, but not completely explaining it. When pushed on this point, Dharmakīrti then drops a presupposition of the Sautrāntrika position and shifts to a kind of Yogācāra position that extramental objects never really occur but arise from the habitual tendencies of mind. So he begins a debate with Hindu schools positing external objects then later to migrate the discussion to how that is logically untenable.\n\nNote there are two differing interpretations of Dharmakīrti's approach later in Tibet, due to differing translations and interpretations. One is held by the Gelug school leaning to a moderate realism with some accommodation of universals and the other held by the other schools who held that Dharmakīrti was distinctly antirealist.\n\nA key feature of Dignāga's logic is in how he treats generalities versus specific objects of knowledge. The Nyāya Hindu school made assertions about the existence of general principles, and in refutation Dignāga asserted that generalities were mere mental features and not truly existent. To do this he introduced the idea of \"Apoha\", that the way the mind recognizes is by comparing and negating known objects from the perception. In that way, the general idea or categories of objects has to do with differences from known objects, not from identification with universal truths. So one knows that a perceived chariot is a chariot not because it is in accord with a universal form of a chariot, but because it is perceived as different from things that are not chariots. This approach became an essential feature of Buddhist epistemology.\n\nThe contemporary of Dignāga but before Dharmakīrti, Bhāvaviveka, incorporated a logical approach when commenting upon Nāgārjuna. He also started with a Sautrāntika approach when discussing the way appearances appear, to debate with realists, but then took a Middle Way view of the ultimate nature of phenomenon. But he used logical assertions and arguments about the nature of that ultimate nature.\n\nHis incorporation of logic into the Middle Way system was later critiqued by Candrakīrti, who felt that the establishment of the ultimate way of abiding since it was beyond thought and concept was not the domain of logic. He used simple logical consequence arguments to refute the views of other tenet systems, but generally he thought a more developed use of logic and epistemology in describing the Middle Way was problematic. Bhāvaviveka's use of autonomous logical arguments was later described as the Svātantrika approach.\n\nModern Buddhist schools employ the 'three spheres' (Sanskrit: trimaṇḍala; Tibetan: 'khor gsum): \n\nWhen Madhyamaka first migrated to Tibet, Śāntarakṣita established a view of Madhyamaka more consistent with Bhāvaviveka while further evolving logical assertions as a way of contemplating and developing one's viewpoint of the ultimate truth.\n\nIn the 14th Century Je Tsongkhapa presented a new commentary and approach to Madhyamaka, which became the normative form in Tibet. In this variant, the Madhyamaka approach of Candrakīrti was elevated instead of Bhāvaviveka's yet Tsongkhapa rejected Candrakirti's disdain of logic and instead incorporated logic further.\n\nThe exact role of logic in Tibetan Buddhist practice and study may still be a topic of debate, but it is definitely established in the tradition.

It is a form of spiritual crisis experienced subjectively as a sense of separation from God or lack of spiritual feeling, especially during contemplative prayer. Paradoxically, it is thought that spiritual dryness can lead to greater love of God.\n\nThe \"Catechism of the Catholic Church\" (CCC) describes spiritual dryness as a difficulty sometimes experienced in one's prayer life, which may lead to discouragement. Dryness can expose a lack of \"rootedness\" in the faith, but also provides an opportunity to cling more strongly to God. The CCC makes reference to the seed that fell on the rocks in Parable of the Sower, as well as to the Grain of Wheat allegory found in the Gospel of John. The \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" calls it a form of \"passive purification,\" the fruit of which is \"the purification of love, until the soul is so inflamed with love of God that it feels as if wounded and languishes with the desire to love Him still more intensely.\"\n\nThe theme of spiritual dryness can be found in the Book of Job, the Psalms, the experiences of the Prophets, and many passages of the New Testament, as illustrated above.\n\nA number of Catholic saints have written about their experiences of spiritual dryness. In the 16th century, Saint John of the Cross famously described it as \"the Dark Night of the Soul\". The 17th-century Benedictine mystic Fr. Augustine Baker called it the \"great desolation\". Mother Teresa's diaries show that she experienced spiritual dryness for most of her life.\n\n"}
{"id": "27568", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27568", "title": "Substance theory", "text": "Substance theory\n\nSubstance theory, or substance–attribute theory, is an ontological theory about objecthood, positing that a \"substance\" is distinct from its properties. A \"thing-in-itself\" is a property-bearer that must be distinguished from the properties it bears.\n\n\"Substance\" is a key concept in ontology and metaphysics, which may be classified into monist, dualist, or pluralist varieties according to how many substances or individuals are said to populate, furnish, or exist in the world. According to monistic views, there is only one substance. Stoicism and Spinoza, for example, hold monistic views, that pneuma or God, respectively, is the one substance in the world. These modes of thinking are sometimes associated with the idea of immanence. Dualism sees the world as being composed of two fundamental substances, for example, the Cartesian substance dualism of mind and matter. Pluralist philosophies include Plato's Theory of Forms and Aristotle's hylomorphic categories.\n\nAristotle used the term \"substance\" ( \"ousia\") in a secondary sense for genera and species understood as hylomorphic forms. Primarily, however, he used it with regard to his category of substance, the specimen (\"this person\" or \"this horse\") or individual, \"qua\" individual, who survives accidental change and in whom the essential properties inhere that define those universals.\n\nIn chapter 6 of book I the \"Physics\" Aristotle argues that any change must be analysed in reference to the property of an invariant subject: as it was before the change and thereafter. Thus, in his hylomorphic account of change, \"matter\" serves as a relative substratum of transformation, i.e., of changing (substantial) form. In the \"Categories\", properties are predicated only of substance, but in chapter 7 of book I of the \"Physics\", Aristotle discusses substances coming to be and passing away in the \"unqualified sense\" wherein primary substances (πρῶται οὐσίαι; \"Categories\" 2a35) are generated from (or perish into) a material substratum by having gained (or lost) the essential property that formally defines substances of that kind (in the secondary sense). Examples of such a substantial change include not only conception and dying, but also metabolism, e.g., the bread a man eats becomes the man. On the other hand, in accidental change, because the essential property remains unchanged, by identifying the substance with its formal essence, substance may thereby serve as the relative subject matter or property-bearer of change in a qualified sense (i.e., barring matters of life or death). An example of this sort of accidental change is a change of color or size: a tomato becomes red, or a juvenile horse grows.\n\nAristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances (which are particulars), there are secondary substances (δεύτεραι οὐσίαι), which are universals (\"Categories\" 2a11–a18).\n\nNeither the \"bare particulars\" nor \"property bundles\" of modern theory have their antecedent in Aristotle, according to whom, all matter exists in some form. There is no \"prime matter\" or pure elements, there is always a mixture: a ratio weighing the four potential combinations of primary and secondary properties and analysed into discrete one-step and two-step abstract transmutations between the elements.\n\nHowever, according to Aristotle's theology, a form of invariant form exists without matter, beyond the cosmos, powerless and oblivious, in the eternal substance of the unmoved movers.\n\nThe Stoics rejected the idea that incorporeal beings inhere in matter, as taught by Plato. They believed that all being is corporeal infused with a creative fire called pneuma. Thus they developed a scheme of categories different from Aristotle's based on the ideas of Anaxagoras and Timaeus.\n\nNeoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For Plotinus, these are the soul or world-soul, being/intellect or divine mind (\"nous\"), and \"the one\".\n\nRené Descartes means by a substance an entity which exists in such a way that it needs no other entity in order to exist. Therefore, only God is a substance in this strict sense. However, he extends the term to created things, which need only the concurrence of God to exist. He maintained that two of these are mind and body, each being distinct from the other in their attributes and therefore in their essence, and neither needing the other in order to exist. This is Descartes' substance dualism.\n\nBaruch Spinoza denied Descartes' \"real distinction\" between mind and matter. Substance, according to Spinoza, is one and indivisible, but has multiple \"attributes\". He regards an attribute, though, as \"what we conceive as constituting the [single] essence of substance\". The single essence of one substance can be conceived of as material and also, consistently, as mental. What is ordinarily called the natural world, together with all the individuals in it, is immanent in God: hence his famous phrase \"deus sive natura\" (\"God or Nature\").\n\nJohn Locke views substance through a corpuscularian lens where it exhibits two types of qualities which both stem from a source. He believes that humans are born tabula rasa or “blank slate” – without innate knowledge. In \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\" Locke writes that “first essence may be taken for the very being of anything, whereby it is, what it is.” If humans are born without any knowledge, the way to receive knowledge is through perception of a certain object. But, according to Locke, an object exists in its primary qualities, no matter whether the human perceives it or not; it just exists. For example, an apple has qualities or properties that determine its existence apart from human perception of it, such as its mass or texture. The apple itself is also “pure substance in which is supposed to provide some sort of ‘unknown support’ to the observable qualities of things” that the human mind perceives. The foundational or support qualities are called primary essences which “in the case of physical substances, are the underlying physical causes of the object's observable qualities”. But then what is an object except “the owner or support of other properties”? Locke rejects Aristotle’s category of the forms, and develops mixed ideas about what substance or “first essence” means. Locke’s solution to confusion about first essence is to argue that objects simply are what they are – made up of microscopic particles existing because they exist. According to Locke, the mind cannot completely grasp the idea of a substance as it “always falls beyond knowledge”. There is a gap between what first essence truly means and the mind’s perception of it that Locke believes the mind cannot bridge, objects in their primary qualities must exist apart from human perception.\n\nThe molecular combination of atoms in first essence then forms the solid base that humans can perceive and add qualities to describe - the only way humans can possibly begin to perceive an object. The way to perceive the qualities of an apple is from the combination of the primary qualities to form the secondary qualities. These qualities are then used to group the substances into different categories that “depend on the properties [humans] happen to be able to perceive”. The taste of an apple or the feeling of its smoothness are not traits inherent to the fruit but are the power of the primary qualities to produce an idea about that object in the mind. The reason that humans can’t sense the actual primary qualities is the mental distance from the object; thus, Locke argues, objects remain nominal for humans. Therefore, the argument then returns to how “a philosopher has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them.” The mind’s conception of substances “[is] complex rather than simple” and “has no (supposedly innate) clear and distinct idea of matter that can be revealed through intellectual abstraction away from sensory qualities”.\n\nThe last quality of substance is the way the perceived qualities seem to begin to change – such as a candle melting; this quality is called the tertiary quality. Tertiary qualities “of a body are those powers in it that, by virtue of its primary qualities, give it the power to produce observable changes in the primary qualities of other bodies”; “the power of the sun to melt wax is a tertiary quality of the sun”. They are “mere powers; qualities such as flexibility, ductility; and the power of sun to melt wax”. This goes along with “passive power: the capacity a thing has for being changed by another thing”. In any object, at the core are the primary qualities (unknowable by the human mind), the secondary quality (how primary qualities are perceived), and tertiary qualities (the power of the combined qualities to make a change to itself and other objects).\n\nThe corpuscularian hypothesis, by Robert Boyle, states that \"all material bodies are composites of ultimately small particles of matter\" that \"have the same material qualities as the larger composite bodies do\". Using this basis, Locke defines his first group, primary qualities, as \"the ones that a body doesn't lose, however much it alters\". The materials retain their primary qualities even if they are broken down because of the unchanging nature of their atomic particles. If someone is curious about an object and they say it is solid and extended, these two descriptors are primary qualities. The second group consists of secondary qualities which are \"really nothing but the powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities\". Locke argues that the impressions our senses perceive from the objects (i.e. taste, sounds, colors, etc.) are not natural properties of the object itself, but things they induce in us by means of the \"size, shape, texture, and motion of their imperceptible parts\", or their atoms. The bodies send insensible particles to our senses which let us perceive the object through different faculties; what we perceive is based on the object's composition. With these qualities, people can achieve the object through bringing \"co-existing powers and sensible qualities to a common ground for explanation\". Locke supposes that one wants to know what \"binds these qualities\" into an object, and argues that a \"substratum\" or \"substance\" has this effect, defining \"substance\" as follows: This substratum is a construct of the mind in an attempt to bind all the qualities seen together; it is only \"a supposition of an unknown support of qualities that are able to cause simple ideas in us\". Without making a substratum, people would be at a loss as to how different qualities relate. Locke does, however, mention that this substratum is an unknown, relating it to the story of the world on the turtle's back and how the believers eventually had to concede that the turtle just rested on \"something he knew not what\". This is how the mind perceives all things and from which it can make ideas about them; it is entirely relative, but it does provide a \"regularity and consistency to our ideas\". Substance, overall, has two sets of qualities that define it, and how we perceive it. These qualities rush to our minds which must organize them. As a result, it creates a substratum for each object to which it groups related qualities.\n\nTwo irreducible concepts encountered in substance theory are the \"bare particular\" and \"inherence\".\n\nIn substance theory, a bare particular of an object is the element without which the object would not exist, that is, its substance, which exists independently from its properties, even if it is impossible for it to lack properties entirely. It is \"bare\" because it is considered without its properties and \"particular\" because it is not abstract. The properties that the substance has are said to inhere in the substance.\n\nAnother primitive concept in substance theory is the inherence of properties within a substance. For example, in the sentence, \"The apple is red\" substance theory says that red inheres in the apple. Substance theory takes the meaning of an apple having the property of redness to be understood, and likewise that of a property's inherence in substance, which is similar to, but not identical with, being part of the substance.\n\nThe inverse relation is participation. Thus in the example above, just as red inheres in the apple, so the apple participates in red.\n\nTwo common arguments supporting substance theory are the argument from grammar and the argument from conception.\n\nThe argument from grammar uses traditional grammar to support substance theory. For example, the sentence \"Snow is white\" contains a grammatical subject \"snow\" and the predicate \"is white\", thereby asserting \"snow is white\". The argument holds that it makes no grammatical sense to speak of \"whiteness\" disembodied, without asserting that snow or something else \"is\" white. Meaningful assertions are formed by virtue of a grammatical subject, of which properties may be predicated, and in substance theory, such assertions are made with regard to a substance.\n\nBundle theory rejects the argument from grammar on the basis that a grammatical subject does not necessarily refer to a metaphysical subject. Bundle theory, for example, maintains that the grammatical subject of statement refers to its properties. For example, a bundle theorist understands the grammatical subject of the sentence, \"Snow is white\", to be a bundle of properties such as white. Accordingly, one can make meaningful statements about bodies without referring to substances.\n\nAnother argument for the substance theory is the argument from conception. The argument claims that in order to conceive of an object's properties, like the redness of an apple, one must conceive of the object that has those properties. According to the argument, one cannot conceive of redness, or any other property, distinct from the substance that has that property.\n\nThe idea of substance was famously critiqued by David Hume, who held that since substance cannot be perceived, it should not be assumed to exist. But the claim that substance cannot be perceived is neither clear nor obvious, and neither is the implication obvious.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche, and after him Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze also rejected the notion of \"substance\", and in the same movement the concept of subject - seeing both concepts as holdovers from Platonic idealism. For this reason, Althusser's \"anti-humanism\" and Foucault's statements were criticized, by Jürgen Habermas and others, for misunderstanding that this led to a fatalist conception of social determinism. For Habermas, only a subjective form of liberty could be conceived, to the contrary of Deleuze who talks about \"\"a\" life\", as an impersonal and immanent form of liberty.\n\nFor Heidegger, Descartes means by \"substance\" that by which \"we can understand nothing else than an entity which \"is\" in such a way that it need no other entity in order to \"be\".\" Therefore, only God is a substance as \"Ens perfectissimus\" (most perfect being). Heidegger showed the inextricable relationship between the concept of substance and of subject, which explains why, instead of talking about \"man\" or \"humankind\", he speaks about the \"Dasein\", which is not a simple subject, nor a substance.\n\nAlfred North Whitehead has argued that the concept of substance has only a limited applicability in everyday life and that metaphysics should rely upon the concept of process.\n\nRoman Catholic theologian Karl Rahner, as part of his critique of transubstantiation, rejected substance theory and instead proposed the doctrine of \"transfinalization\", which he felt was more attuned to modern philosophy. However, this doctrine was rejected by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical \"Mysterium fidei\".\n\nIn direct opposition to substance theory is bundle theory, whose most basic premise is that all concrete particulars are merely constructions or 'bundles' of attributes or qualitative properties:\n\nThe bundle theorist's principal objections to substance theory concern the bare particulars of a substance, which substance theory considers independently of the substance's properties. The bundle theorist objects to the notion of a thing with no properties, claiming that such a thing is inconceivable and citing John Locke, who described a substance as \"a something, I know not what.\" To the bundle theorist, as soon as one has any notion of a substance in mind, a property accompanies that notion.\n\nThe indiscernibility argument from the substance theorist targets those bundle theorists who are also metaphysical realists. Metaphysical realism uses the identity of \"universals\" to compare and identify particulars. Substance theorists say that bundle theory is incompatible with metaphysical realism due to the identity of indiscernibles: particulars may differ from one another only with respect to their attributes or relations.\n\nThe substance theorist's indiscernibility argument against the metaphysically realistic bundle theorist states that numerically different concrete particulars are discernible from the self-same concrete particular only by virtue of qualitatively different attributes.\n\nThe indiscernibility argument points out that if bundle theory and discernible concrete particulars theory explain the relationship between attributes, then the identity of indiscernibles theory must also be true:\n\nThe indiscernibles argument then asserts that the identity of indiscernibles is violated, for example, by identical sheets of paper. All of their qualitative properties are the same (e.g. white, rectangular, 9 x 11 inches...) and thus, the argument claims, bundle theory and metaphysical realism cannot both be correct.\n\nHowever, bundle theory combined with trope theory (as opposed to metaphysical realism) avoids the indiscernibles argument because each attribute is a trope if can only be held by only one concrete particular.\n\nThe argument does not consider whether \"position\" should be considered an attribute or relation. It is after all through the differing positions that we in practice differentiate between otherwise identical pieces of paper.\n\n"}

The title has a double meaning and can also be understood as Wumen's Barrier; the compiler's name, which literally means \"No Gate\", is the same as the title's first two characters. Wumen's preface indicates that the volume was published in 1228. Each koan is accompanied by a commentary and verse by Wumen. A classic edition includes a 49th case composed by Anwan (pen name for Cheng Ch'ing-Chih) in 1246. Wu-liang Tsung-shou also supplemented the volume with a verse of four stanzas composed in 1230 about the three checkpoints of Zen master Huanglong. These three checkpoints of Huanglong should not be confused with Doushuai's Three Checkpoints found in Case 47.\n\nAlong with the \"Blue Cliff Record\" and the oral tradition of Hakuin Ekaku, \"The Gateless Gate\" is a central work much used in Rinzai School practice. Five of the koans in the work concern the sayings and doings of Zhaozhou; four concern Ummon.\n\nThe common theme of the koans of the Wumen Guan and of Wumen's comments is the inquiry and introspection of dualistic conceptualization. Each koan epitomizes one or more of the polarities of consciousness that act like an obstacle or wall to the insight. The student is challenged to transcend the polarity that the koan represents and demonstrate or show that transcendence to the Zen teacher.\n\nThe text was originally prepared by Wumen as a record of his teaching during a monastic training period held at \"Longxiang\" (Soaring Dragon) monastery in the summer of 1228. Wumen selected the 48 koans and commented on and added a verse for each koan. His teachings were transcribed and after the training period were compiled into the collection called the Wumen Guan.\n\nAs was customary in China at the time, an edition might have additions of text inserted by a subsequent owner or publisher. The most well known version of the text is from the Japanese wood block edition made from the 1246 manuscript edition that contains the following sections.\n\n\nThe Wumen Guan has an appendix titled \"Zen Caveats\" (禪箴) with one-line aphorisms dealing with Zen practice The word \"zhēn\" (箴) means \"caveat\", \"warning\", or \"admonition\", but it also has the meaning of \"needle\" or \"probe\" (as in acupuncture needles) and is sometimes translated as \"Zen Needles\". As with the main koans, each caveat challenges the Zen student's attachment to dualistic concepts, here those especially related to Zen practice.\n\n"}
{"id": "30988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30988", "title": "Tibetan Buddhism", "text": "Tibetan Buddhism\n\nTibetan Buddhism is the form of Buddhist doctrine and institutions named after the lands of Tibet, but also found in the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\" It has been spread outside of Tibet, especially due to the Mongol power of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, that also ruled China.\n\nTibetan Buddhism applies Tantric practices, especially deity yoga, and aspires to Buddhahood or the rainbow body. Tibetan Buddhism in Tibet has four major schools, namely Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug (developed out of Sakya). The Jonang is a smaller school, and the Rimé movement is an eclectic movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools. Among the prominent proponents of Tibetan Buddhism are the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama, the leaders of Gelug school in Tibet.\nWesterners unfamiliar with Tibetan Buddhism initially turned to China for an understanding. There the term used was \"lamaism\" (literally, \"doctrine of the lamas\": \"lama jiao\") to distinguish it from a then-traditional Chinese form (\"fo jiao\"). The term was taken up by western scholars including Hegel, as early as 1822. Insofar as it implies a discontinuity between Indian and Tibetan Buddhism, the term has been discredited.\n\nAnother term, \"Vajrayāna\" is occasionally used mistakenly for Tibetan Buddhism. More accurately, it signifies a certain subset of practices included in, not only Tibetan Buddhism, but other forms of Buddhism as well.\n\nThe native Tibetan term for all Buddhism is \"doctrine of the internalists\" (\"nang-pa'i chos\": …of those who emphasise introspection).\n\nIn the west, the term \"Indo-Tibetan Buddhism\" has become current, in acknowledgement of its derivation from the latest stages of Buddhist development in northern India.\n\nBuddhism was formally introduced into Tibet during the Tibetan Empire (7th-9th century AD). Sanskrit Buddhist scriptures from India were first translated into Tibetan under the reign of the Tibetan king Songtsän Gampo (618-649), In the 8th century King Trisong Detsen (755-797) established it as the official religion of the state. Trisong Detsen invited Indian Buddhist scholars to his court, including Padmasambhāva (8th century) and Śāntarakṣita (725–788)), who founded the Nyingma, \"The Ancient Ones\", the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism. There was also influence from the Sarvāstivādins from Kashmir to the southwest and Khotan to the northwest. Trisong Detsen also invited the Chan master Moheyan to transmit the Dharma at Samye Monastery. According to Tibetan sources, Moheyan lost the socalled council of Lhasa (793), a debate sponsored by Trisong Detsen on the nature of emptiness with the Indian master Kamalaśīla, and the king declared Kamalaśīlas philosophy should form the basis for Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nA reversal in Buddhist influence began under King Langdarma (r. 836-842), and his death was followed by the socalled \"Era of Fragmentation\", a period of Tibetan history in the 9th and 10th centuries. During this era, the political centralization of the earlier Tibetan Empire collapsed.\n\nThe late 10th and 11th century saw a revival of Buddhism in Tibet. Coinciding with the early discoveries of \"hidden treasures\" (\"terma\"), the 11th century saw a revival of Buddhist influence originating in the far east and far west of Tibet. In the west, Rinchen Zangpo (958-1055) was active as a translator and founded temples and monasteries. Prominent scholars and teachers were again invited from India.\n\nIn 1042 Atiśa (982-1054 AD) arrived in Tibet at the invitation of a west Tibetan king. This renowned exponent of the Pāla form of Buddhism from the Indian university of Vikramashila later moved to central Tibet. There his chief disciple, Dromtonpa founded the Kadampa school of Tibetan Buddhism, under whose influence the New Translation schools of today evolved.\n\nThe Sakya, the \"Grey Earth\" school, was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great Lotsawa, Drogmi Shākya (). It is headed by the Sakya Trizin, traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa, and represents the scholarly tradition. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251AD), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.\n\nOther seminal Indian teachers were Tilopa (988–1069) and his student Naropa (probably died ca. 1040 AD).The Kagyu, the \"Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word\", is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa\n\nTibetan Buddhism exerted a strong influence from the 11th century CE among the peoples of Inner Asia, especially the Mongols. The Mongols invaded Tibet in 1240 and 1244. The Mongols had annexed Amdo and Kham to the east. Sakya Paṇḍita was appointed Viceroy of Central Tibet by the Mongol court in 1249. \n\nTibet was incorporated into the Mongol Empire, retaining nominal power over religious and regional political affairs, while the Mongols managed a structural and administrative rule over the region, reinforced by the rare military intervention. Tibetan Buddhism was adopted as the \"de facto\" state religion by the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, whose capital is Xanadu (Beijing, China).\n\nWith the decline of the Yuan dynansty and the loose administration of the following (Han-Chinese) Ming dynasty, Central Tibet was ruled by successive local families from the 14th to the 17th century, and Tibet would gain de facto a high autonomy after the 14th century.\n\nJangchub Gyaltsän (Byang chub rgyal mtshan, 1302–1364) became the strongest political family in the mid 14th century. During this period the reformist scholar Je Tsongkhapa (1357–1419) founded the Gelug sect which would have a decisive influence on Tibet's history. Internal strife within the Phagmodrupa dynasty, and the strong localism of the various fiefs and political-religious factions, led to a long series of internal conflicts. The minister family Rinpungpa, based in Tsang (West Central Tibet), dominated politics after 1435. In 1565 the Rinpungpa family was overthrown by the Tsangpa Dynasty of Shigatse which expanded its power in different directions of Tibet in the following decades and favoured the Karma Kagyu sect. They would play a pivotal role in the events which led to the rise of power of the Dalai Lama's in the 1640s.\n\nThe \"Ganden Phodrang\" was the Tibetan regime that was established by the 5th Dalai Lama with the help of the Güshi Khan of the Khoshut Mongols in 1642. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas and Panchans ruled Tibet as regional governance from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\n\nThe Qing dynasty (1644-1912) established a Chinese full rule over Tibet after a Qing expedition force defeated the Dzungars (who controlled Tibet) in 1720, and lasted until the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912. The Manchu rulers of the Qing dynasty supported Tibetan Buddhism, especially the Gelug sect, for most times of their dynasty of China.\n\nThe Rimé movement was a 19th-century movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813-1899) compiled together the teachings of the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would have been much more final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the \"Rinchen Terdzod\" and the \"Sheja Dzö\".\n\nIn 1912, following the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Tibet became de facto independent under the 13th Dalai Lama government based in Lhasa, maintaining the current territory of what is now called the Tibetan Autonomous Region. After the Battle of Chamdo Tibet was annexed by the Chinese People's republic in 1950. In 1959 the 14th Dalai Lama and a great number of clergy fled the country, to settle in India and other neighbouring countries. The events of the Cultural Revolution (1966–76) saw religion as one of the main political targets of the Chinese Communist Party and most of the several thousand temples and monasteries in Tibet were destroyed, with many monks and lamas imprisoned. Matters were made much worse by the Chinese Cultural Revolution. During this time, private religious expression, as well as Tibetan cultural traditions were being suppressed. Much of the Tibetan textual heritage was destroyed, and monks and nuns were forced to disrobe. Outside of Tibet however there was a renewed interest in Tibetan Buddhism in places such as Nepal and Bhutan, while the spread of Tibetan Buddhism in the Western world was accomplished by many of the refugee Tibetan Lamas who escaped Tibet.\n\nAfter the liberalization policies in China during the 1980s, the religion began to recover with some temples and monasteries being reconstructed. Tibetan Buddhism is now an influential religion among educated Chinese and also in Taiwan.\n\nToday, Tibetan Buddhism is adhered to widely in the Tibetan Plateau, Mongolia, northern Nepal, Kalmykia (on the north-west shore of the Caspian), Siberia (Tuva and Buryatia), the Russian Far East and northeast China. It is the state religion of Bhutan. The Indian regions of Sikkim and Ladakh, both formerly independent kingdoms, are also home to significant Tibetan Buddhist populations, as are the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh (which includes Dharamshala and the district of Lahaul-Spiti), West Bengal (the hill stations of Darjeeling and Kalimpong) and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nIn the wake of the Tibetan diaspora, Tibetan Buddhism has gained adherents in the West and throughout the world. Fully ordained Tibetan Buddhist Monks now work in academia.\n\nGeoffrey Samuel sees the character of Tibetan Buddhism in the West as\n\nTibetan Buddhism comprises the teachings of the three vehicles of Buddhism: the Foundational Vehicle, \"Mahāyāna\", and \"Vajrayāna\". The Mahāyāna goal of spiritual development is to achieve the enlightenment of buddhahood in order to most efficiently help all other sentient beings attain this state. The motivation in it is the \"bodhicitta\" mind of enlightenment — an altruistic intention to become enlightened for the sake of all sentient beings. \"Bodhisattvas\" are revered beings who have conceived the will and vow to dedicate their lives with \"bodhicitta\" for the sake of all beings. Widely revered Bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism include Avalokiteshvara, Manjushri, Vajrapani, and Tara.\n\nBuddhahood is defined as a state free of the obstructions to liberation as well as those to omniscience. When one is freed from all mental obscurations, one is said to attain a state of continuous bliss mixed with a simultaneous cognition of emptiness, the true nature of reality. In this state, all limitations on one's ability to help other living beings are removed. Tibetan Buddhism claims to teach methods for achieving Buddhahood more quickly (known as the Vajrayāna path). \n\nIt is said that there are countless beings who have attained buddhahood. Buddhas spontaneously, naturally and continuously perform activities to benefit all sentient beings. However it is believed that one's \"karma\" could limit the ability of the Buddhas to help them. Thus, although Buddhas possess no limitation from their side on their ability to help others, sentient beings continue to experience suffering as a result of the limitations of their own former negative actions.\n\n\"Lamrim\" (Tibetan: \"stages of the path\") is a Tibetan Buddhist textual form for presenting the stages in the complete path to liberation as taught by Buddha. In Tibetan Buddhist history there have been many different versions of \"lamrim\", presented by different teachers of the Nyingma, Kagyu and Gelug schools. However, all versions of the \"lamrim\" are elaborations of Atiśa's 11th-century root text \"A Lamp for the Path to Enlightenment\" (\"Bodhipathapradīpa\").\n\nAtisha's lamrim system generally divides practitioners into those of \"lesser\", \"middling\" and \"superior\" scopes or attitudes:\n\nAlthough \"lamrim\" texts cover much the same subject areas, subjects within them may be arranged in different ways and with different emphasis depending on the school and tradition it belongs to. Gampopa and Tsongkhapa expanded the short root-text of Atiśa into an extensive system to understand the entire Buddhist philosophy. In this way, subjects like karma, rebirth, Buddhist cosmology and the practice of meditation are gradually explained in logical order.\n\nTibetan Buddhism is a form of Vajrayana (\"Vajra vehicle\") or Buddhist Tantra, affirming the views espoused in the texts known as the Buddhist Tantras (dating from around the 7th century CE onwards). Tantra (Tibetan: \"rgyud\") generally refers to forms of religious practice which emphasize the use of unique visualizations, ideas, symbols and rituals for inner transformation. The Vajrayana is seen by its adherents as the fastest and most powerful vehicle for enlightenment because it contains many special techniques and because it takes the effect (Buddhahood itself, or Buddha nature) as the path (and hence is sometimes known as the \"effect vehicle\"). \n\nThese texts also generally affirm the use of sense pleasures in Tantric ritual as a path to enlightenment, as opposed to non-Tantric Buddhism which affirms that one must renounce all sense pleasures. These practices are based on the theory of transformation which states that negative or sensual mental factors and physical actions can be cultivated and transformed in a ritual setting, the Hevajra tantra states:\n\nThose things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.\n\nAnother element of the Tantras is their use of transgressive practices, such as drinking alcohol or sexual yoga. While in many cases these transgressions were interpreted only symbolically, in other cases they are practiced literally.\n\nMadhyamaka is the dominant Buddhist philosophy of Tibetan Buddhism and is generally seen as the highest view, but is interpreted in various ways. Shunyata, the true nature of reality, or the emptiness of inherent existence of all things, is traditionally propounded according to a hierarchical classification of four classical Indian philosophical schools. While the classical tenets-system, as propagated by the Gelugpa, is limited to four tenets (Vaibhāṣika, Sautrāntika, Yogācāra, and Madhyamaka), more complicated systems include also the \"shentong\"-view of the Jonang and the Kagyu, and also differentiates between the radical emptiness of the Gelugpa-school, and the experiential emptiness of the Nyingma and the Shakya.\n\nTwo tenets belong to the path referred to as the Hinayana, and are both Sarvastivada-subschools. They do not include Theravada, the only surviving of the 18 classical schools of Buddhism:\n\nThe other two tenets are Mahayana:\n\nThe tenet systems are being used in the monasteries and colleges to teach Buddhist philosophy in a systematic and progressive fashion, each philosophical view being more subtle than its predecessor. Therefore, the four schools can be seen as a gradual path from a rather easy-to-grasp, \"realistic\" philosophical point of view, to more and more complex and subtle views on the ultimate nature of reality, that is on emptiness and dependent arising, culminating in the philosophy of the Mādhyamikas, which is widely believed to present the most sophisticated point of view. Non-Tibetan scholars point out that historically, Madhyamaka predates Cittamātra, however.\n\nSignificant genuine innovations in Tibetan Buddhism have been few. Although the system of incarnate lamas is popularly held to be an innovation, it is disputable that this is a distinctly Tibetan development. Two centuries before Buddhism was introduced to Tibet, in the fifth century CE, the \"Abhidharma\" teacher Buddhaghoṣa was declared by Sri Lankan elders to be a reincarnation of the bodhisattva Maitreya.\n\nStudy of major Buddhist Indian texts is central to the monastic curriculum in all four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Memorization of classic texts as well as other ritual texts is expected as part of traditional monastic education. The main liturgical language is classical Tibetan. Another important part of higher religious education was the practice of formalized debate. \n\nSince the late 11th century, traditional Tibetan monastic colleges generally organized the exoteric study of Buddhism into \"five great textual traditions\" (\"zhungchen-nga\").\n\n\nTantric texts are divided into our or six categories, with several sub-categories for the highest Tantras. In the Nyingma, the division is into \"Outer Tantras\" (Kriyayoga, Charyayoga, Yogatantra); and \"Inner Tantras\" (Mahayoga, Anuyoga, Atiyoga (Tib. Dzogchen)), which correspond to the Anuttarayogatantra. In the Gelug, Sakya, and Kagyu, the division is into Kriyayoga, Charyayoga, Yogatantra, Anuttarayogatantra (mother tantras, father tantras, non-dual tantras).\n\nImportant tantric texts are the Hevajra Tantra (8th century) and the Kalachakra Tantra (mid-11th century).\n\nAlso of great importance are the \"Five Treatises of Maitreya\" including the influential \"Ratnagotravibhāga\", a compendium of the tathāgatagarbha literature, and the \"Mahayanasutralankara\", a text on the Mahayana path from the Yogacara perspective, which are often attributed to Asanga. Practiced focused texts such as the Yogacarabhumi and Kamalaśīla's Bhāvanākrama are the major sources for meditation. The Buddhist Tantras are another class of texts which form a whole other corpus of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition focusing on Tantra practices.\n\nWhile the Indian texts are often central, newer Tibetan material is also widely studied. The commentaries and interpretations that are used to shed light on these texts differ according to tradition. The Gelug school for example, use the works of Tsongkhapa, while other schools may use the more recent work of Rimé movement scholars like Jamgon Kongtrul and Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso. \n\nA corpus of extra-canonical scripture, the treasure texts (\"terma\") literature is acknowledged by Nyingma practitioners, but the bulk of the canon that is not commentary was translated from Indian sources. True to its roots in the \"Pāla\" system of North India, however, Tibetan Buddhism carries on a tradition of eclectic accumulation and systematisation of diverse Buddhist elements, and pursues their synthesis. Prominent among these achievements have been the Stages of the Path and mind training, both stemming from teachings by the Indian pandit, Atiśa.\n\nThere is a long history of oral transmission of teachings in Tibetan Buddhism. Oral transmissions by lineage holders traditionally can take place in small groups or mass gatherings of listeners and may last for seconds (in the case of a mantra, for example) or months (as in the case of a section of the Tibetan Buddhist canon). It is held that a transmission can even occur without actually hearing, as in Asanga's visions of Maitreya.\n\nAn emphasis on oral transmission as more important than the printed word derives from the earliest period of Indian Buddhism, when it allowed teachings to be kept from those who should not hear them. Hearing a teaching (transmission) readies the hearer for realization based on it. The person from whom one hears the teaching should have heard it as one link in a succession of listeners going back to the original speaker: the Buddha in the case of a \"sutra\" or the author in the case of a book. Then the hearing constitutes an authentic lineage of transmission. Authenticity of the oral lineage is a prerequisite for realization, hence the importance of lineages.\n\nThere has been a \"close association\" between the religious and the secular, the spiritual and the temporal in Tibet. The term for this relationship is \"chos srid zung 'brel.\" Traditionally Tibetan lamas have tended to the lay populace by helping them with issues such as protection and prosperity. Common traditions have been the various rites and rituals for mundane ends, such as purifying one's karma, avoiding harm from demonic forces and enemies, and promoting a successful harvest. Divination and exorcism are examples of practices a lama might use for this.\n\nRitual is generally more elaborate than in other forms of Buddhism, with complex altar arrangements and works of art, many ritual objects, hand gestures (mudra), chants, and musical instruments.\n\nA special kind of ritual called an initiation or empowerment (Sanskrit: \"Abhiseka\", Tibetan: \"Wangkur\") is central to Tantric practice. These rituals consecrate a practitioner into a particular Tantric practice associated with individual mandalas of deities and mantras. Without having gone through initiation, one is generally not allowed to practice the higher Tantras. \n\nAnother important ritual occasion in Tibetan Buddhism is that of mortuary rituals which are supposed to assure that one has a positive rebirth and a good spiritual path in the future. Of central importance to Tibetan Buddhist \"Ars moriendi\" is the idea of the Bardo (Sanskrit: \"antarābhava\"), the intermediate or liminal state between life and death. Rituals and the readings of texts such as the Bardo Thodol are done to ensure that the dying person can navigate this intermediate state skillfully. Cremation and sky burial are traditionally the main funeral rites used to dispose of the body.\n\nVajrayāna is believed by Tibetan Buddhists to be the fastest method for attaining Buddhahood but for unqualified practitioners it can be dangerous. To engage in it one must receive an appropriate initiation (also known as an \"empowerment\") from a lama who is fully qualified to give it. From the time one has resolved to accept such an initiation, the utmost sustained effort in guru devotion is essential.\n\nThe aim of preliminary practices (\"ngöndro\") is to start the student on the correct path for such higher teachings. Just as Sutrayāna preceded Vajrayāna historically in India, so sutra practices constitute those that are preliminary to tantric ones. Preliminary practices include all \"Sutrayāna\" activities that yield merit like hearing teachings, prostrations, offerings, prayers and acts of kindness and compassion, but chief among the preliminary practices are realizations through meditation on the three principle stages of the path: renunciation, the altruistic bodhicitta wish to attain enlightenment and the wisdom realizing emptiness. For a person without the basis of these three in particular to practice Vajrayāna can be like a small child trying to ride an unbroken horse.\n\nWhile the practices of Vajrayāna are not known in Sutrayāna, all Sutrayāna practices are common to Vajrayāna. Without training in the preliminary practices, the ubiquity of allusions to them in Vajrayāna is meaningless and even successful Vajrayāna initiation becomes impossible.\n\nThe merit acquired in the preliminary practices facilitates progress in Vajrayāna. While many Buddhists may spend a lifetime exclusively on sutra practices, however, an amalgam of the two to some degree is common. For example, in order to train in calm abiding, one might use a tantric visualisation as the meditation object.\n\nThe paramitas (perfections) is a key set of virtues practiced in this tradition. \n\n\nThe practice of \"Dāna\" (giving) while traditionally referring to offerings of food to the monastics can also refer to the ritual offering of bowls of water, incense, butter lamps and flowers to the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas on an shrine or household altar. Similar offerings are also given to other beings such as hungry ghosts, dakinis, protector deities, local divinities etc.\n\nLike other forms of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of the five precepts and Bodhisattva vows is part of Tibetan Buddhist moral (\"sila\") practice. In addition to these, there are also numerous sets of Tantric vows, termed Samaya, which are given as part of Tantric initiations.\n\nCompassion (Karuṇā) practices are also particularly important in Tibetan Buddhism. One of the foremost authoritative texts on the Bodhisattva path is the \"Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra\" by Shantideva. In the eighth section entitled \"Meditative Concentration\", Shantideva describes meditation on Karunā as thus:\n\nA popular compassion meditation in Tibetan Buddhism is Tonglen (sending and taking love and suffering respectively).\n\nTraditionally, Tibetan Buddhism follows the two main approaches to meditation as taught in all forms of Buddhism, śamatha (Tib. \"Shine\") and vipaśyanā (Tib. \"lhaktong\"). \n\nThe practice of śamatha (calm abiding) is one of focusing one's mind on a single object such as a Buddha figure or the breath. Through repeated practice one's mind gradually becomes more stable, calm and happy. The nine stages of training the mind is the main progressive framework used for śamatha in Tibetan Buddhism.\n\nThe other form of Buddhist meditation is vipaśyanā (clear seeing, insight). This is generally seen as having two aspects, one of which is analytic meditation, thinking rationally about ideas and concepts in a scholarly or philosophical manner. As part of this process, entertaining doubts and engaging in internal debate over them is encouraged in some traditions. The other type of vipaśyanā is a non-analytical, \"simple\" yogic style called \"trömeh\" in Tibetan, which means \"without complication\".\n\nA meditation routine may involve alternating sessions of vipaśyanā to achieve deeper levels of realization, and samatha to consolidate them.\n\nAs in other Buddhist traditions, an attitude of reverence for the teacher, or guru, is also highly prized. At the beginning of a public teaching, a \"lama\" will do prostrations to the throne on which he will teach due to its symbolism, or to an image of the Buddha behind that throne, then students will do prostrations to the lama after he is seated. Merit accrues when one's interactions with the teacher are imbued with such reverence in the form of guru devotion, a code of practices governing them that derives from Indian sources. By such things as avoiding disturbance to the peace of mind of one's teacher, and wholeheartedly following his prescriptions, much merit accrues and this can significantly help improve one's practice.\n\nThere is a general sense in which any Tibetan Buddhist teacher is called a \"lama\". A student may have taken teachings from many authorities and revere them all as \"lamas\" in this general sense. However, he will typically have one held in special esteem as his own root guru and is encouraged to view the other teachers who are less dear to him, however more exalted their status, as embodied in and subsumed by the root guru. One particular feature of the Tantric view of teacher student relationship is that in Tibetan Buddhist Tantra, one is instructed to regard one's guru as an awakened Buddha.\n\nIn Vajrayāna particularly, Tibetan Buddhists subscribe to a voluntary code of self-censorship, whereby the uninitiated do not seek and are not provided with information about it. This self-censorship may be applied more or less strictly depending on circumstances such as the material involved. A depiction of a mandala may be less public than that of a deity. That of a higher tantric deity may be less public than that of a lower. The degree to which information on Vajrayāna is now public in western languages is controversial among Tibetan Buddhists.\n\nBuddhism has always had a taste for esotericism since its earliest period in India. Tibetans today maintain greater or lesser degrees of confidentiality also with information on the \"vinaya\" and emptiness specifically. In Buddhist teachings generally, too, there is caution about revealing information to people who may be unready for it.\n\nThe use of (mainly Sanskrit) prayer formulas, incantations or phrases called mantras (Tibetan: \"sngags\") is another widespread feature of Tibetan Buddhist practice. So common is the use of mantras that Vajrayana is also sometimes called \"Mantrayana\" (the mantra vehicle). Mantras are widely recited, chanted, written or inscribed, and visualized as part of different forms of meditation. Each mantra has symbolic meaning and will often have a connection to a particular Buddha or Bodhisattva. Each deity's mantra is seen as symbolizing the function, speech and power of the deity. Tibetan Buddhist practitioners repeat mantras in order to train the mind, and transform their thoughts in line with the divine qualities of the mantra's deity and special power. \n\nTibetan Buddhists see the etymology of the term mantra as meaning \"mind protector\", and mantras is seen as a way to guard the mind against negativity. According to Lama Zopa Rinpoche: \n\nMantras are effective because they help keep your mind quiet and peaceful, automatically integrating it into one-pointedness. They make your mind receptive to very subtle vibrations and thereby heighten your perception. Their recitation eradicates gross negativities and the true nature of things can then be reflected in your mind’s resulting clarity. By practising a transcendental mantra, you can in fact purify all the defiled energy of your body, speech, and mind. \nMantras also serve to focus the mind as a samatha (calming) practice as well as a way to transform the mind through the symbolic meaning of the mantra. In Buddhism, it is important to have the proper intention, focus and faith when practicing mantras, if one does not, they will not work. Unlike in Hinduism, mantras are not believed to have inherent power of their own, and thus without the proper faith, intention and mental focus, they are just mere sounds. Thus according to the Tibetan philosopher Jamgon Ju Mipham:\n\nif a mantra is thought to be something ordinary and not seen for what it is, it will not be able to perform its intended function. Mantras are like non-conceptual wish-fulfilling jewels. Infusing one's being with the blessings of mantra, like the form of a moon reflected on a body of water, necessitates the presence of faith and other conditions that set the stage for the spiritual attainments of mantra. Just as the moon's reflection cannot appear without water, mantras cannot function without the presence of faith and other such factors in one's being.\n\nMantras are part of the highest tantric practices in Tibetan Buddhism, such as Deity Yoga and are recited and visualized during tantric sadhanas. Thus, Tsongkhapa says that mantra \"protects the mind from ordinary appearances and conceptions\". This is because in Tibetan Buddhist Tantric praxis, one must develop a sense that everything is divine (divine pride).\n\nIn what is called \"higher yoga tantra\" the emphasis is on various yoga practices which allow the practitioner to realize the true nature of reality.\n\n\"Deity Yoga\" (Tibetan: \"lha'i rnal 'byor\"; Sanskrit: \"Devata-yoga\") is the fundamental, defining practice of Vajrayana Buddhism involving visualization of mental images. According to the Tibetan scholar Tsongkhapa, deity yoga is what separates Buddhist Tantra practice from the practice of other Buddhist schools.\n\nDeity yoga involves two stages, the generation stage and the completion stage. In the generation stage, one dissolves the mundane world and visualizes one's chosen deity (yidam), its mandala and companion deities, resulting in identification with this divine reality. In the completion stage, one dissolves the visualization of and identification with the yidam in the realization of sunyata or emptiness. Completion stage practices can also include subtle body energy practices, as well as other practices such as the Six Yogas of Naropa.\n\nThe views and practices associated with Dzogchen and Mahamudra are often seen as the culmination of the tantric path. These practices focus on the very nature of reality and experience, termed dharmakaya.\n\nThe diagram to the right shows the historical development of Tibetan Buddhist traditions. The four main ones overlap markedly, such that \"about eighty percent or more of the features of the Tibetan schools are the same\". Differences include the use of apparently, but not actually, contradictory terminology, opening dedications of texts to different deities and whether phenomena are described from the viewpoint of an unenlightened practitioner or of a Buddha. On questions of philosophy the inclusion (Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Kagyu) or exclusion (Gelugpa) of Yogacara and Buddha-nature teachings has been a historical divide between schools, which still colours the approaches to \"sunyata\" and ultimate reality. The 19th century Rimé movement downplayed these differences, as still reflected in the stance of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, who states that there are no fundamental differences between these schools. The Tibetan adjectival suffix \"-pa\" meaning \"man\" or \"person\" is translatable as English \"-ist\", \"e.g.\", \"Nyingmapa\" is \"person who practises Nyingma\".\n\n\"The Ancient Ones\" is the oldest school of Tibetan Buddhism and the original order founded by Padmasambhava (8th century) and Śāntarakṣita (725–788). Whereas other schools categorize their teachings into the three yānas or \"vehicles\", Hīnayāna, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, the Nyingma tradition classifies its teachings into Nine Yānas, among the highest of which is Dzogchen. Terma \"treasures\" (revealed texts) are of particular significance to the Nyingma school.\n\nThe Kadam school () of Tibetan Buddhism was founded by Dromtön (1005–1064), a Tibetan lay master and the foremost disciple of the great Bengali master Atiśa (982-1054). The Kadampa were quite famous and respected for their proper and earnest Dharma practice. The most evident teachings of that tradition were the teachings on bodhicitta. Later, these special presentations became known as lojong and lamrim by Atiśa. Kadam instructional influence lingered long after the school disappeared.\n\nThe \"Grey Earth\" school represents the scholarly tradition. Headed by the Sakya Trizin, this tradition was founded by Khön Könchok Gyelpo (, 1034–1102), a disciple of the great Lotsawa, Drogmi Shākya () and traces its lineage to the mahasiddha Virūpa. A renowned exponent, Sakya Pandita (1182–1251CE), was the great-grandson of Khön Könchok Gyelpo.\n\nThe Jonang is a minor school that branched off from Sakya traditions; it was suppressed in 1650 in Gelug-controlled regions and subsequently banned and its monks and nuns converted to the Gelug school in 1658.\n\nThe Jonang re-established their religio-political center in Golok, Nakhi and Mongol areas in Kham and Amdo centered at Dzamthang Monastery and have continued practicing uninterrupted to this day. An estimated 5,000 monks and nuns of the Jonang tradition practice today in these areas and at the edges of historic Gelug influence.\n\nHowever, their teachings were limited to these regions until the Rimé movement of the 19th century encouraged the study of non-Gelug schools of thought and practice. In modern times it has been encouraged to grow by the 14th Dalai Lama, who installed the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutughtu as its head.\n\n\"Lineage of the (Buddha's) Word\". This is an oral tradition which is very much concerned with the experiential dimension of meditation. Its most famous exponent was Milarepa, an 11th-century mystic. It contains one major and one minor subsect. The first, the Dagpo Kagyu, encompasses those Kagyu schools that trace back to the Indian master Naropa via Marpa Lotsawa, Milarepa and Gampopa and consists of four major sub-sects: the Karma Kagyu, headed by a Karmapa, the Tsalpa Kagyu, the Barom Kagyu, and Pagtru Kagyu. There are a further eight minor sub-sects, all of which trace their root to Pagtru Kagyu and the most notable of which are the Drikung and Drukpa Lineages. The once-obscure Shangpa Kagyu, which was famously represented by the 20th century teacher Kalu Rinpoche, traces its history back to the Indian master Naropa via Niguma, Sukhasiddhi and Khyungpo Naljor.\n\nThe \"Way of Virtue\" school was originally a reformist movement and is known for its emphasis on logic and debate. The order was founded in the 14th to 15th century by Je Tsongkhapa, renowned for both his scholarship and virtue. He was a prominent supporter of the Madhyamika philosophy and formalized the Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction. Its spiritual head is the Ganden Tripa and its temporal one the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama is regarded as the embodiment of Avalokiteśvara. After the civil war in the 17th century and the Mongol intervention, the Gelugpa school dominated Tibetan Buddhism, and successive Dalai Lamas ruled Tibet from the mid-17th to mid-20th centuries.\n\nThe \"New Kadampa Tradition\" is a Buddhist new religious movement founded by Kelsang Gyatso in England in 1991, which branched-off from the Gelugpa school.\n\nIn the 19th century the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, along with some Bon scholars, cooperated the Rimé movement to prevent the loss of many of their teachings and revive their traditions, in response to the dominance of the Gelugpa school.\n\nThe four major schools are sometimes said to constitute the Nyingma \"Old Translation,\" and Sarma \"New Translation\" traditions, the latter following from the historical Kadam lineage of translations and tantric lineages. Another common but trivial differentiation is into the Yellow Hat (Gelug) and Red Hat (non-Gelug) sects, a division that mirrors the distinction between the schools involved in the Rimé movement versus the one that did not, the Gelug.\n\nThe correspondences are as follows:\n\nWhen Buddhism traveled from India to Tibet, apparently the quorum of bhikṣuṇīs required for bestowing full ordination never reached Tibet. Despite an absence of ordination there, bhikṣuṇīs did travel to Tibet. A notable example was the Sri Lankan nun Candramāla, whose work with Śrījñāna () resulted in the tantric text \"Śrīcandramāla Tantrarāja\".\n\nThere are singular accounts of fully ordained Tibetan women, such as the Samding Dorje Phagmo (1422-1455), who was once ranked the highest female master in Tibet, but very little is known about the exact circumstances of their ordination.\n\nBuddhist author Michaela Haas notes that Tibetan Buddhism is undergoing a sea change in the West. The Dalai Lama has authorized followers of the Tibetan tradition to be ordained as nuns in traditions that have such ordination.\n\nFreda Bedi was a British woman who was the first Western woman to take ordination in Tibetan Buddhism, which occurred in 1966. Pema Chödrön was the first American woman to be ordained as a Buddhist nun in the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. In 2010 the first Tibetan Buddhist nunnery in America, Vajra Dakini Nunnery in Vermont, was officially consecrated. It offers novice ordination and follows the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism. The abbot of the Vajra Dakini nunnery is Khenmo Drolma, an American woman, who is the first bhikṣuṇī in the Drikung lineage of Buddhism, having been ordained in Taiwan in 2002. She is also the first westerner, male or female, to be installed as an abbot in the Drikung Kagyu lineage of Buddhism, having been installed as the abbot of the Vajra Dakini Nunnery in 2004. The Vajra Dakini Nunnery does not follow The Eight Garudhammas. In April 2011, the Institute for Buddhist Dialectical Studies (IBD) in Dharamsala, India, conferred the degree of geshe, a Tibetan Buddhist academic degree for monastics, on Kelsang Wangmo, a German nun, thus making her the world's first female geshe. In 2013 Tibetan women were able to take the geshe exams for the first time. In 2016 twenty Tibetan Buddhist nuns became the first Tibetan women to earn geshe degrees. Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo gained international attention in the late 1980s as the first Western woman to be a His Holininess Penor Rinpoche enthroned tulku within the Nyingma Palyul.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroductory books\n\"Insider\" texts\nOther books\n\n"}

Trust money is held in connection with the provision of legal services and is highly regulated. A lawyer or law firm should not appropriate a client's trust money until certain regulations are met, which are different for each State in Australia. The Australian system regulating lawyers and their trust accounts has been labeled by the Rudd Government as an \"unwieldy monster\".\n\nTrust money is held to cover the practitioner’s fees and disbursements over a period of time and may be required to be topped up as a matter progresses. \n\nThe accounting of trust money is highly regulated and even though the money is controlled by the law practice the money still belongs to the client until such time as it is applied to an invoice or disbursement. The exact regulations in Australia are different for each State, in everything from cost disclosure to trust accounting, which lawyers say cause inefficiencies and cost clients millions of dollars every year. \n\nPrior to 1976 it was not uncommon for solicitors to pay their costs and disbursements from trust money without obtaining the clients instructions to do so. The profession at large now accepts that this practice is unlawful and that prior instructions must be obtained.\n\nAfter a 1976 New South Wales Supreme Court Decision it appeared that withdrawals by a lawyer from a trust account could only be made in two situations:\n\nIn 1978 the law societies in Victoria and South Australia advised their members that they should \"issue a bill of costs to the client wherever costs are taken from the trust account and not take such costs until the client has had proper opportunity to object\".\n\nIn 1984 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission published the \"Fourth Report on the Legal Profession: Solicitors' Trust Accounts\". Chapter five of that report was titled \"Handling Trust Money: Issues Relating to Costs and Disbursements\" and discussed many issues relating to trust accounts in NSW and around Australia. \n\nThe national legal profession model bill, which was supposed to eliminate the differences, took about ten years to develop and was finally signed off by the Standing Committee of Attorneys General, (SCAG), in 2011. All Australian States and Territories except South Australia have during 2004 to 2008 adopted the national legal profession model.\n\nIn New South Wales trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2004\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulation 2005\".\n\nIf you receive a bill from your solicitor and want to challenge a withdrawal, you have seven days to make your objection known. If you do not lodge an application for a Cost Assessment with the Supreme Court of NSW within sixty days after being given the bill, the solicitor will be able to withdraw the money from the trust account.\n\nIn Victoria trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2004\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulations 2005\".\n\nThe law practice may withdraw the trust money if the practice has given the person a bill relating to the money and if the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money within seven days after being given the bill or the person has objected within seven days after being given the bill but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act within sixty days after being given the bill.\n\nIn Queensland trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2007\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulation 2007\". \n\nThe law practice may withdraw the trust money if the practice has given the person a bill relating to the money and if the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money within seven days after being given the bill or the person has objected within seven days after being given the bill but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act within sixty days after being given the bill. \n\nIn Western Australia trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2008\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulations 2009\". \n\nThe law practice may withdraw the trust money if the practice has given the person a bill relating to the money and if the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money within seven days after being given the bill or the person has objected within seven days after being given the bill but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act within sixty days after being given the bill. \n\nIn South Australia trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Practitioners Act, 1981\" and the \"Legal Practitioners Regulations 2009\". \n\nSA is yet to push the national legal profession model bill through parliament, because of a political deadlock over compensation for victims of trust account fraud.\n\nA legal practitioner or law firm cannot appropriate money from a clients trust account in or towards satisfaction of a claim for legal costs unless a bill specifying the total amount of those costs, and describing the legal work to which the costs relate, has been delivered to the person liable to the costs either personally, or by post addressed to the person at the person's last known place of business or residence. The person liable to legal costs may at any time within six months after delivery of a bill of costs request the person claiming to be entitled to the costs to provide a statement showing in detail how the amount of the costs to which the bill relates is made up.\n\nIn 2012 the Law Society of South Australia published a fact sheet on appropriating Trust Money for Payment of Fees. The fact sheet explains that if a practitioner posts a bill for fees to a client, it is not legally considered to have been \"delivered\" in accordance with section 41(1) of the Act, until the minimum amount of time in which the bill would be delivered in the ordinary course of post has passed. The Law Society recommends that 3 business days be allowed to pass after posting the bill before appropriation of trust money towards that bill. Further, the Law Society states that if the client objects to the bill the trust money should remain in trust.\n\nIn Tasmania trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2007\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulations 2007\". \n\nThe law practice may withdraw trust money if the practice has given the person a bill, written request for payment or notice of proposed withdrawal relating to the money and the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money within seven days after being given the bill, request or notice the person has objected within seven days after being given the bill, request or notice but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act within sixty days after being given the bill, request or notice.\n\nIn the Australian Capital Territory trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act 2006\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulations 2006\". \n\nThe law practice may withdraw the trust money if the practice has given the person a bill relating to the money and if the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money not later than seven days after being given the bill or the person has objected not later than seven days after being given the bill but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act not later than sixty days after being given the bill. \n\nIn the Northern Territory trust money is regulated by the \"Legal Profession Act\" and the \"Legal Profession Regulations\". \n\nThe law practice may withdraw the trust money if the practice has given the person a bill relating to the money and if the person has not objected to withdrawal of the money within seven days after being given the bill or the person has objected within seven days after being given the bill but has not applied for a review of the legal costs under the Act within sixty days after being given the bill. \n\nIn Australia if a dispute arises over the accounting or application of the trust money the client should notify the appropriate Law Society.\n\nOne high-profile South Australian case was with Brenton Willoughby, a law clerk at Magarey Farlam Lawyers, and involved $4.5 million.\n\nAnother high-profile South Australian case was the \"Stashed cash affair\" involving the Crown Solicitors Trust Account. The South Australian Attorney-General at the time, Michael Atkinson, likened his Supreme Court cross-examination over the \"stashed cash affair\" to being \"tortured with a comfy cushion\". \n\nIn 2009 a Perth lawyer was charged with stealing $11,000 from a trust account. \n\nIn South Australia in 2010, in Australia's most expensive divorce, claims of overcharging and discrepancies handling trust money were made. \n\nA high-profile case of mishandling trust money was in Queensland, where a Logan councilor Hajnal Black was found to have mishandled trust money for a dementia patient. Ms Black was found guilty of four charges relating to pecuniary interests and fined $5,000. \n\nA New South Wales Criminal lawyer, Brett Galloway, was found guilty in 2012 for charges relating to his trust account handling. \n\nAnother high-profile case was that of a Perth lawyer, Lloyd Rayney, who was charged with murder of his wife, but found not guilty of the murder in late 2012. During Rayney's murder investigation, trust money anomalies in his 2 daughter's trust accounts were found. They had received payments of more than $200,000 from one of Mr Rayney's biggest clients, Gina Rinehart's Hancock Prospecting.\n\nIn South Australia in the 1960s a Guarantee Fund was set up from a percentage of the interest made on clients' money while in legal trust accounts. The Guarantee Fund is administered by the Law Society and is used to fund consumer protection services such as the Legal Practitioners Conduct Board and to make hardship payments when people have lost money from legal trust accounts. \n\nUntil the mid-1990s there was a Solicitors Guarantee Fund in Victoria (SGF). From the mid-1990s, after the relevant Victorian legislation was changed, a new Solicitors Fidelity Fund (SFF) came into being in place of the SGF. The legal interpretation of the two words effected by the change from SGF to SFF is significant. \"Guarantee\" and \"Fidelity\" do not mean the same thing. By implication the new fidelity fund did not provide a guarantee, the financial considerations are different with on the one hand liability of the fund vis-a-vis fidelity being limited to a finite amount, and on the other hand, in earlier times - the \"Guarantee era\" - liability of the fund being unlimited.\n\nDuring the early to mid-1990s the amount of clients' money being lost at the hands of some Victorian solicitors became so large that the Solicitors Guarantee Fund began running year in year out in deficit, since it did not have sufficient income to meet the gross admitted claims against the fund. One of several major contributors to the ongoing deficit situation was Dudley Tregent & Co, which involved defalcations of between $10 million and $14 million of clients' funds. The core amount of $10 million to $14 million was topped up by a further $3 million or so in interest payable on claims because of the time it took to settle admitted claims, a period of 6 years from 1992 to 1998, while interest was accruing on the pending payouts at a statutory rate of 5% per annum.\n\nTwo other significant cases of solicitors losing clients' funds took place in the 1990s.\n\nOne of these was the small legal firm Tietyens' practice on the border with NSW. Tietyens ran a contributory mortgage scheme backed by about 1,100 investors that furnished an investment of about $42 million in the Tally Ho Retirement Village in Burwood East in Melbourne. \n\nA further Melbourne case was the murder of Max Green in Phnom Penh. Max Green was a partner in the law firm Aroni Colman. In the Max Green case the amount lost was estimated at $38 million, ostensibly the $38 million was for the purchase of plant and equipment to be then leased to Transurban. Transurban denied any knowledge of this leasing arrangement. Some of the clients of Mr Green who lost their money in this case were other solicitors.\n\nIn general, the fidelity funds or guarantee funds do not admit claims involving criminal conduct or dishonest conduct on the part of the lawyers. Fidelity funds ironically are not designed to rectify infidelities, rather they cater for losses arising from honest mistakes by lawyers and/or their lack of investment acumen.\n\nIf there remains a positive dormant balance in a clients trust account at the end of a matter, the client is entitled to the return of that trust money as soon as practicable. In 2012 South Australian Law Society director of Professional Standards, Ros Burke, advised practitioners that they could use the \"Unclaimed Money Act\" to clear the balance. By charging a fee to try to locate the client that the trust money belongs to, as long as the fee is generated in accordance with the appropriate \"Legal Practitioners Act\", the practitioner can appropriate that sum out of the dormant trust money. \n\n"}
