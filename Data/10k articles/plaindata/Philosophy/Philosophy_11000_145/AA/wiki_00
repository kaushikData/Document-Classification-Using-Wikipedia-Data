Much work in applied ontology is carried out within the framework of the semantic web.\n\nThe challenge of applying ontology is ontology's emphasis on a world view orthogonal to epistemology. The emphasis is on being rather than on doing (as implied by \"applied\") or on knowing. This is explored by philosophers and pragmatists like Fernando Flores and Martin Heidegger.\n\nOne way in which that emphasis plays out is in the concept of \"speech acts\": acts of promising, ordering, apologizing, requesting, inviting or sharing. The study of these acts from an ontological perspective is one of the driving forces behind relationship-oriented applied ontology. This can involve concepts championed by ordinary language philosophers like Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nApplying ontology can also involve looking at the relationship between a person's world and that person's actions. The context or clearing is highly influenced by the being of the subject or the field of being itself. This view is highly influenced by the philosophy of phenomenology, the works of Heidegger, and others.\nSocial scientists adopt a number of ontological approaches. Some of these are:\n\n\n"}

BFFs are usually in close contact and have shared experiences, such as attending the same school or sharing musical tastes. Relationships described as BFF are common in high school and often decline when the parties go to college. The term BFF does not necessarily convey exclusivity; depending on a person's individual interpretation or philosophy of the concept of \"BFF\", an individual may not have more than one BFF simultaneously.\n\nAlthough the concept of having or being a \"best friend\" is ageless, the acronym BFF was popularized as a quick way for friends to sign off and express their positive feelings for one another while instant-messaging (IM-ing) on the computer or sending a text message on cell phones.\n\nThe acronym \"BFF\" was added to the New Oxford American Dictionary on 16 September 2010. The dictionary states that the acronym BFF originated in 1996.\n\nAccording to a survey in France, the BFF friendship is a concept that occupies a certain place on social networks. This value is reassuring, especially for the millennial generation that experiences a divorce frequently. It is a sign of social success and a balanced life.\n\nA large survey of friendship in the UK in 2003 found that on average, people had nine close friends. In elementary and middle school, best friendships often last less than one full academic year.\n\nBarbara Delinsky described a BFF as \"someone you don't have to see every day to still connect with, someone who loves you whether you talk often or not, someone who would drop everything and catch the next flight if you needed her. It's someone who couldn't care less where or what she eats, as long as she's with you.\"\n\nIn a 1997 episode, season 3 episode 25, of \"Friends\", Lisa Kudrow's character, Phoebe Buffay, uses the term.\n\nMichael Scott uses the abbreviation as well in S2E2 of \"The Office (U.S. TV series)\".\n\n\"Paris Hilton's My New BFF\", also known as \"My New BFF\", is a competitive reality television show in which Paris Hilton searches for her new BFF.\n\n\"Best Friends Forever\" was an American television comedy series that ran on NBC from April 4, to June 1, 2012.\n\nIn 2009, social networking service Myspace launched \"BFF\", an online game show series that tested how well best friends knew each other.\n\n\"Best Friends Forever (South Park)\" is an episode of Comedy Central's South Park, which first aired 30 March 2005, based on the Terri Schiavo case.\n\nEileen Kennedy-Moore says that parents can help children cope with a conflict between friends through strategies such as empathizing, discouraging retaliation, and encouraging relationship repair.\n\nIn 2010, the BFF concept was a part of a BFF contract \"to encourage the signatories to work through their differences before splitting up.\"\n\nIn their article \"Friendship and Natural Selection\" in July, 2014, Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler reported a positive correlation between close friendships and common genotypes, indicating that DNA similarities may be a causal factor in establishing friendships.\n\nIn a study conducted at the University of Oxford, Tamas David-Barrett and his colleagues reported that there is an unusually large number of profile pictures on Facebook that depict two women. This pattern is present in each region of the world. After eliminating the alternative hypotheses, the study concluded that the finding suggests that (a) close friendship formation patterns are universal among humans, and (b) there is a marked gender difference in the propensity to form lasting friendship due to an evolutionary ultimate cause. This suggests that the BFF concept, albeit with a different name, may exist in many cultures, going back to evolutionary times. Recent studies have also shown that close friends are treated as siblings throughout the lifespan.\n\nCompanies like Coca Cola have used the expression on some of their Cola products. Their cans say \"Share a Diet Coke with your BFF\".\n"}

Traditionally, monastics observed the basic moral code in Buddhism, the Prātimokṣa (such as that of the Dharmaguptaka), but in the Mahayana tradition, monks may observe the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.\n\nThe \"Brahmajala Sutra\", translated by Kumārajīva (c. 400 CE), has a list of ten major and forty-eight minor Bodhisattva vows. The Bodhisattva Precepts may be often called the \"Brahma Net Precepts\" (), particularly in Buddhist scholarship, although other sets of bodhisattva precepts may be found in other texts as well. Typically, in East Asian Mahayana traditions, only the ten major precepts are considered the bodhisattva precepts. According to the sutra, the ten major bodhisattva precepts are in summary:\n\n\nBreaking any of these precepts is described as a major offense in the sutra. A fuller description is as follows:\nAsanga (circa 300 AD) delineated 18 major vows and forty-six minor vows in the \"Bodhisattvabhumi\" section of the \"Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra\". These Bodhisattva vows are still used in all four major traditions of Tibetan Buddhism. The eighteen major vows (as actions to be abandoned) are as follows:\n\nAccording to Atiśa, the Prātimokṣa vows are the basis for the Bodhisattva vows. Without keeping one of the different sets of Prātimokṣa vows (in one of the existing Vinaya schools), there can be no Bodhisattva vow.\n\nIn the Sōtō school of Zen, the founder Dōgen established a somewhat expanded version of the Bodhisattva Precepts for use by both priests and lay followers, based on both Brahma Net Sutra and other sources. Many various translations exist, the following is used by John Daido Loori, rōshi at the Zen Mountain Monastery:\n\n\nThe Three Treasures are universally known in Buddhism as the Three Refuges or Three Jewels.\n\n\nThese are also known as the \"Three Root Precepts\", and are mentioned in the Brahma Net Sutra as well.\n\n\nThe Chinese Chan monk, Yin Shun, wrote of the Bodhisattva Precepts, \"To cultivate bodhi mind means to accept the bodhisattva precepts and practice the ten good deeds.\"\n\nIn practice, the acceptance of and ordination of the Bodhisattva Precepts varies greatly depending on the school of Mahayana Buddhism. In East Asian Buddhism, a fully ordained monk or nun ordains under the traditional prātimokṣa precepts first according to the vinaya of the Dharmaguptaka. In the Chinese tradition, this is called the \"Four Part Vinaya\" (). Then as a supplement, the same disciple would undertake the Bodhisattva Precepts as well.\n\nMonks and nuns are not considered \"ordained\" by the Bodhisattva Precepts, but rather by the \"Four Part Vinaya\", while the Bodhisattva Precepts served to strengthen the Mahayana ideals. Similarly, the Bodhisattva Precepts are given to lay disciples to strengthen their devotion to Buddhism as well. Such disciples often take the basic Five Precepts and then the Bodhisattva precepts as a supplement.\n\nIn Buddhism in Japan, the \"Four-Part Vinaya\" was deemphasized with the rise of Saichō and the Tendai sect and a new monastic community was set up exclusively using the \"Brahmajala Sutra\"s Bodhisattva Precepts. All Vinaya ordinations at the time were given at Tōdai-ji in Nara and Saichō had wanted to both undermine the power of the Nara Buddhist community and to establish a \"purely Mahayana lineage\", and made a request to the Emperor to Later Buddhist sects, which was granted 7 days after his death in 822.\n\nLater Buddhist sects in Japan, including the Sōtō school of Zen, Jōdo-shū and Shingon Buddhism, adopted a similar approach to their monastic communities and exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts. By this time in Japan, the Vinaya lineage had all but died out and Japan's remote location made it difficult to reestablish though limited efforts by Jōkei and the Shingon Risshu revived it for a time. This was further enforced during the Meiji period, when the of 1872 decriminalized clerical marriage and meat-eating.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "42033797", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=42033797", "title": "Carl Raschke", "text": "Carl Raschke\n\nCarl A. Raschke (1944-) is an American philosopher and theologian. Raschke is a Past Chair and Professor of Religious Studies Department at the University of Denver, specializing in continental philosophy, the philosophy of religion and the theory of religion. He is also listed with the affiliated faculty of the Global Center for Advanced Studies. Raschke is known in part for his research on postmodern theology, popular religion, philosophy of culture and philosophy of technology. He received his B.A. from Pomona College, his M.A. from The Graduate Theological Union, and his Ph.D. from Harvard University. Raschke is senior editor for \"The Journal for Cultural and Religious Theory\" and a regular contributor to \"Political Theology Today\". A major focus of Raschke's work has been postmodernism. In recent years he has written on the theory of religion and political theology.\n\nDuring the late 1980s and 1990s, Raschke published works on (and made media appearances regarding) Satanism, the occult, heavy metal music, and subjects such as \"Dungeons and Dragons\". In addition, Raschke was an expert witness on some cases involving Satanism, regularly made comments and appearances for the media on related topics, and advised the American Family Foundation; Raschke's comments and work during this period, particularly his 1990 book \"Painted Black\", have been overwhelmingly condemned by scholars as inaccurate and repeatedly cited as having assisted in fueling the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic during the period, and Raschke's status as an \"expert\" on these topics has been criticized.\n\nA central focus of Raschke’s work has been on postmodern religious thought and postmodernism. According to \"The Encyclopedia of Postmodernism\", his “work has sought to expose a conceptual tangle in modernity’s approach to language, religion, and the body.\" Raschke launched this project in the 1970s with the publication of an article in \"The Harvard Theological Review\" entitled “Meaning and Saying in Religion: Beyond Language Games,” in which he “argues that the failure of Anglo-American philosophy to adequately account for religious language reveals a deeper failure to account for the process of meaning-formation at the heart of language itself.” His first major book, \"The Alchemy of the Word: Language and the End of Theology\" (1979), which was republished in 2000 as \"The End of Theology\", lays out this agenda in detail with reliance in particular on the philosophy of the later Martin Heidegger. \"Fire and Roses: Postmodernity and the Thought of the Body\" (1996) explores these interconnections by seeking to “reconcile erotic and tragic discourses through the thought of the Word made flesh.” An earlier work, entitled \"Theological Thinking: An In-Quiry\" (1988), investigates the interconnections between the languages of religion and science.\n\nAfter the turn of the millennium, Raschke turned his attention to the impact of postmodernism on Christian evangelical thought. His book, \"The Next Reformation: Why Evangelicals Must Embrace Postmodernity,\" explained how postmodern philosophy might transform present day evangelical theology, comparing it to Reformation thought, in particular Martin Luther’s key doctrines of \"sola fide\" (“by faith alone”) and \"sola Scriptura\" (“according to Scripture alone\"). He writes in this book that “the postmodernist revolution in philosophy…has tendered an environment where the Christian gospel can at last be disentangled from the centuries-long gnarl of scientism, rationalism, secularism, humanism, and skepticism.” Reviewing the book, Brian C. Smith notes in \"Library Journal\" that Raschke challenges the conventional evangelical view of \"postmodernism\" and \"exudes an embracing and accepting spirit toward it.\" A later book, entitled \"GloboChrist,\" published as part of a general series by Baker Academic Books, argued that the theory of the “rhizome,” first advanced by twentieth century French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, can be used to model the future of the Christian church in the new era of globalization. In an interview with the Evangelical Philosophical Society in 2009, Raschke explains he borrowed this term because “globalization is an ongoing, simultaneous transformation of nations, cultures, and religious outlooks and practices everywhere on the planet which they term ‘de-territorialization.’” Commenting on \"GloboChrist\" scholar Richard Haney criticizes the book for its \"breezy terminology\", but concludes the book \"will challenge Christians to think missionally and philosophically at the same time.\" In his contribution among three authors to the volume \"Faith and Reason: Three Views\", Raschke has argued that the gospel represented a departure from Greek and Enlightenment philosophies, and that faith and reason are \"in tension\" with each other.\n\nMore recently, Raschke has written on the general theory of religion. His book,\"The Revolution in Religious Theory: Toward A Semiotics of the Event,\" lays out how postmodern philosophy has impacted and reshaped both classical and contemporary paradigms of how we understand what is meant by the “religious.” In an interview with David Hale, Raschke criticizes many scholars of religion, particularly in regard to \"cults\", for approaching their subject as a \"pseudo-phenomenology\" that \"does not seek to probe, or dialectically reflect, beyond the bare given.\" In reviewing the book, McGill University scholar Nathan Strunk writes that Raschke criticizes the history of religious studies as colonializing with a tendency toward \"Aryanization\", and thus \"readers should not be surprised if some areas they consider sacred are tread over lightly.\" His latest book, \"Force of God: Political Theology and the Crisis of Liberal Democracy,\" leverages the philosophies of Michel Foucault and Friedrich Nietzsche to analyze from what he terms a “genealogical” standpoint the ongoing global economic crisis and the dysfunctions of democracy.\n\nRaschke has been credited with being \"one of the first to register the importance of Derrida's work for postmodern philosophies of religion .\"\n\nHe is section editor for \"The Encyclopedia of Sciences and Religions\".\n\nRaschke has written and commented on topics such as Satanism, \"Dungeons and Dragons\", heavy metal music and certain new religious movements. His work in this area as well as his role in the development of the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic of the late 1980s and early 1990s, in particular the book \"Painted Black\" (1990), have been much criticized in academia.\n\nParticularly during the late 1980s and 1990s, Raschke regularly commented to the media on matters involving Satanism and the occult, advised the American Family Foundation during the 1990s, and appeared as an expert witness during trials purportedly involving Satanism. Raschke has continued to accept media requests for comment on these topics, such as for an object purportedly involved in the murder of Jessica Ridgeway in 2012.\n\nReviewing \"Painted Black\" in 1991, scholar Jonathon S. Epstein writes: \"\"Painted Black\" adds additional fuel to the flames of hysteria surrounding satanism [\"sic\"] in America\", that \"what the book lacks is scholarship, it makes up for it in sweeping and unsupportable generalizations\", and that … \"\"Painted Black\" cannot be taken seriously. In 1995, scholar Wouter J. Hanegraaff writes \"Raschke's eagerness to include everything \"gnostic\" into a \"genealogy of darkness\" (\"Painted Black\", 133) inspires sloppy historical scholarship. … With a similar lack of sensitivity for the power of words and definitions, Raschke routinely uses \"satanism\" and \"occultism\" as synonyms (for instance, \"Painted Black\", 35-36). This careless attitude towards terminology leads to painfully inaccurate overviews (esp. \"Painted Black\", chapter 4).\" Writing in 1998, scholar Phillip Jenkins cites Raschke's \"Painted Black\" next to Maury Terry's \"Ultimate Evil\" and Larry Kahaner's \"Cults That Kill\" along with an episode of Geraldo Rivera's talk show (\"Geraldo\", \"Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's Underground\") as examples of major works that popularized the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic in the late 1980s and 1990s. Jenkins says \"For several years, belief in the existence of satanic cults and ritual murder achieved wider credence in the United States than it had in any other society since that of sixteenth-century Europe\", where the moral panic subsequently spread to areas of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.\nIn an analysis of Raschke's role in adding fuel to the 1980s and early 1990s United States Satanic ritual abuse moral panic, scholar Eugene V. Gallagher (2004) notes that Raschke referred to critics of his works as \"cult apologists\" but says \"the shrillness of Raschke's argument ... ultimately fails to compensate for the paucity of evidence behind it\". Referring to Raschke's \"Painted Black\", scholar Joshua Gunn (2005) writes that \"Raschke's error-filled tome is frequently cited by seemingly secular academics who profess in a belief of Satanic ritual abuse\".\n\nScholar Arthur Versluis (2006) is highly critical of Raschke's \"Painted Black\", which he describes as an \"effort to awaken an American inquisition\" and refers to the book as \"breathless sensationalism\". Versluis cites Raschke's description of the roleplaying game \"Dungeons and Dragons\" as a means of initiation into \"black magic\" as an example and says that \"it is scarcely possible to exaggerate the hysterical nature of this book, nor the number of errors in it (although some have tried at least to chronicle them).\" Versluis is critical of Raschke's role in the Satanic ritual abuse moral panic, noting the false imprisonments that the moral panic resulted in, and says, regarding \"Painted Black\", \"This is dangerous stuff indeed ... Fortunately, Raschke's book didn't have the kind of impact he so clearly wanted: to fully awaken the medieval Inquisitorial spirit. But ... the 1980s and the 1990s 'Satanic panic' was bad enough.\"\n\nComparing Raschke's \"Painted Black\" to Tipper Gore's 1987 book \"Raising PG Kids in an X-Rated Society\" in that Gore \"invoked Satan as the seducer of youth\", scholar Robert Latham (2007) refers to Carl Raschke as \"a tabloid 'expert' on 'cults'\". Latham is particularly critical of Raschke's claims that MTV \"had put an entire generation of teens at risk of satanic contamination\" and writes that \"Raschke's indictment of the resultant 'Dionysian frenzy' ... indiscriminately conflated acts of violence, sexual 'deviance', and supernaturalism in a millennial scenario of youth's spectacular degeneracy.\"\n\nScholars Asbjørn Dyrendal, James R. Lewis, and Jesper AA. Petersen (2015) provide examples of Raschke \"quoting ... misleadingly and out of context\" and \"hav[ing] forgotten all his academic training, and reverted, in a telling manner, to the folklore of evil\". The scholars characterize Raschke as an \"until-then well-reputed academic\" (referring to the publication of \"Painted Black\"). Scholar Joseph P. Laycock is highly critical of statements that Raschke made in the 1980s and early 1990s regarding Satanism in popular culture, noting that Raschke \"is one of the few academics who embraced the moral panic over Satanism and role-playing games in the 1980s\". Analyzing Raschke's works on heavy metal, scholar Robert Walser (2013) says that \"the terrorism of Raschke and similar critics depends upon two tactics: anecdote and insinuation. Raschke himself cites a group of sociologists of religion who determined that there was 'not a shred of evidence' that Satanism is a problem in America, directly contradicting the thesis of Rashke's book.\"\n\nRaschke's comments regarding Heathenry have also been criticized. According to a 1998 interview with the SPLC, Raschke claimed that \"a recent biological terrorism threat in New York City may have come from Asatrúers [\"sic\"]\" (quote from SPLC 1998, reprinted in Gardell 2003). Citing this claim as an example of the reception of Heathenry in his overview, scholar Mattias Gardell (2003) says \"I have found nothing to substantiate the alarmist allegations of Raschke\".\n\nIn an article on Wicca and media for the \"Oxford Handbook of Religion and the News Media\" (2012), scholar Sarah M. Pike describes how a media report during the trial for the West Memphis Three \"failed to consult experts on Wicca and Satanism\" but rather referred to material by Raschke, who she describes as a \"widely discredited 'Satanism expert'\".\n\nRaschke has written and commented in the media extensively on contemporary religion, especially regarding the New Age Movement. His most cited and often controversial book on this is \"The Interruption of Eternity\" (1980). Other writings of this kind include \"The New Age: The Movement Toward Self-Discovery\", \"New Age Spirituality\" and \"New Age Economics\".\n\n\n\n"}

The Copenhagen School places particular emphasis on the non-military aspects of security, representing a shift away from traditional security studies. Theorists associated with the school include Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver and Jaap de Wilde. Many of the school's members worked at the Copenhagen Peace Research Institute. A prominent critic of the Copenhagen School is Bill McSweeney.\n\nThe primary book of the Copenhagen School is \"\", written by Buzan, Wæver and de Wilde.\n\nBill McSweeney is generally credited with coining the term 'Copenhagen School'.\n\nThe concept of 'sectors' concerns the different arenas where we speak of security. The list of sectors is primarily an analytical tool created to spot different dynamics. In \"\", the authors list the following sectors: military/state, political, societal, economic and environmental. As such, CS theory can be regarded as 'widening' traditional materialist security studies by looking at security in these 'new' sectors.\n\nThe concept of regional security complexes covers how security is clustered in geographically shaped regions. Security concerns do not travel well over distances and threats are therefore most likely to occur in the region. The security of each actor in a region interacts with the security of the other actors. There is often intense security interdependence within a region, but not between regions, which is what defines a region and what makes regional security an interesting area of study. Insulator states sometimes isolate regions, such as Afghanistan's location between the Middle East and South Asia. Insulators mark boundaries of indifference, where security dynamics stand back to back. They contrast with the traditional idea of 'buffer states' which are located at points where security dynamics are intense (e.g. Belgium between Germany and France). Regions should be regarded as mini systems where all other IR theories can be applied, such as Balance of Power, polarity, interdependence, alliance systems, etc.\n\nRegional Security Complex Theory should not be confused with Regionalism, a subset of IR from the 1970s concerned mostly with regional integration.\n\n, and the one that has generated the most literature. It is argued that 'security' is a speech act with distinct consequences in the context over international politics. By talking security an actor tries to move a topic away from politics and into an area of security concerns thereby legitimating extraordinary means against the socially constructed threat. Instead securitization of a subject depends on an audience accepting a securitization move, undertaken by the securitizing actor.\n\nSome of the most detailed books on the subject are:\n\nA criticism that has been advanced against the Copenhagen School is that it is a eurocentric approach to security. \n\n\n\n"}

Crosby\n\nDonald Allen Crosby (born 7 April 1932) is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Colorado State University, since January 2000. Crosby's interests focus on metaphysics, American pragmatism, philosophy of nature, existentialism, and philosophy of religion. He is a member of the Highlands Institute of American Religious and Philosophical Thought (HAIRPT) and has been a leader in the discussions on Religious Naturalism.\n\nCrosby is a Religious Naturalist having contributed to the movement with six books and a number of journal articles and chapters in books. He argues that nature itself, without notions of God, gods, animating spirits, or supernatural beings or realms of any kind, is both metaphysically and religiously ultimate, and thus an appropriate and compelling focus of religious commitment and concern. Nature as a whole can be considered sacred. This is so despite the radical ambiguities of nature, or its intricate mixtures of goods and evils, to which he calls sustained attention in his 2008 book \"Living with Ambiguity: Religious Naturalism and the Menace of Evil\".\n\nHe was born in Mansfield, Ohio, and grew up in Pensacola, Florida. He attended Davidson College in North Carolina and trained for the Presbyterian ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was minister of a Presbyterian church in Christiana, Delaware, for three years and decided after that time to study for a doctorate in religion, with emphasis on philosophy of religion and ethics, in the joint program in religion at Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University in New York City. During the first two years of his doctoral work he served as part-time assistant minister at the First Congregational Church on the Green in Norwalk, Connecticut. Following upon his doctoral studies, he became an assistant professor of philosophy and religion at Centre College in Danville, Kentucky. In the fall of 1965 he began teaching religious studies and philosophy in the philosophy department at Colorado State University, from which he retired as Emeritus Professor of Philosophy in 2001.\n\nCrosby demitted the Presbyterian ministry in 1969 and began to develop his version of religious naturalism in writings dating from the early 1990s, reaching fuller expression in \"A Religion of Nature\" in 2002, and continuing to the present. Impetus for this process of development also dates from the writing of his book on philosophical nihilism, \"The Specter of the Absurd\", published in 1988 and from his study of, and constructive work on, theories of religion in \"Interpretive Theories of Religion\", published in 1981. The writing of his doctoral dissertation on Horace Bushnell’s theory of language, published in 1975 as \"Horace Bushnell’s Theory of Language in the Context of Other Nineteenth Century Philosophies of Language\", contributed greatly to the freeing of his mind from any vestiges of biblical or theological literalism, as did his studies of the origins and characters of the Hebrew and Christian scriptures at Princeton.\n\nIn addition, Crosby’s exposure to the field of world religions at Columbia helped to broaden his thought far beyond its earlier religious conservatism. The \"God is Dead\" movement in the 1960s, and especially its reflections on theological implications of the atrocities of the Nazi regime and the carnage of World War II, had an important influence on his abandonment of traditional theism. Finally, teaching courses on the philosophy of religion and on various philosophical systems in a secular university challenged him constantly to reflect on the relevance of religious and philosophical thought for his time and to continue to work out his own religious and philosophical outlook. He has been strongly influenced by the thought of William James, John Dewey, Alfred North Whitehead, and Paul Tillich in doing so, but other great philosophical and religious thinkers of the Western tradition have made their decisive contributions to his outlook as well, as have important writers about Eastern ways of thinking and living. Still another major influence on Crosby’s outlook is the findings of contemporary science, especially in the fields of cosmology, evolutionary biology, and ecology.\n\nCrosby summarizes much of his current mode of religious and philosophical thought with four “Ps”: pluralism, perspectivism, processism, and pragmatism. Discussion of the natures and interrelations of these four themes in his philosophy is presented, among other places, in his 2005 book \"Novelty\" and in the book \"Living with Ambiguity\". To these four major themes typifying Crosby’s philosophical and religious outlook should be added the theme of his religious and philosophical naturalism. A sixth basic theme, also developed in his book \"Novelty\", is the theme of emergentism, especially the emergence of life from non-life and of conscious life from organic life in general. A final important theme brought to the fore in this book is his defense of indeterminism and freedom. This theme is given further development in his books \"Nature as Sacred Ground\" and \"Consciousness and Freedom.\" All these themes have far-reaching consequences for philosophy of nature and a religious naturalism.\n\nThe individual perspectives on Religious Naturalism of Loyal Rue, Jerome A. Stone, Ursula Goodenough and Crosby are discussed by Michael Hogue in his 2010 book\" The Promise of Religious Naturalism\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumerous other articles, book chapters, book reviews and booknotes 1966-2017\n\n\n\n"}

He was an important Mexican writer, philosopher and politician. He is one of the most influential and controversial personalities in the development of modern Mexico. His philosophy of the \"cosmic race\" affected all aspects of Mexican sociocultural, political, and economic policies.\n\nJosé Vasconcelos was born in Oaxaca, Oaxaca on February 28, 1882, the son of a customs official. José's mother, who was a pious Catholic, died when José was sixteen. The family moved to the border town of Piedras Negras, Coahuila, where he grew up attending school in Eagle Pass, Texas. He became bilingual in English and Spanish, which opened doors to the English-speaking world. The family also lived in Campeche during a period when the northern border area was unstable. His time in living on the Texas border likely contributed to fostering his idea of the Mexican \"cosmic race\" and rejection of Anglo culture.\n\nHe married Serafina Miranda of Tlaxiaco in the state of Oaxaca in 1906, when he was twenty-four. With her he had children José Ignacio and Carmen. He also had a long-term relationship with Elena Arizmendi Mejia and through life, many other shorter liaisons, including one with Berta Singerman. His troubled relationship with Antonieta Rivas Mercado led to her suicide inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral in 1931. When his wife of forty years died in 1942, their daughter Carmen is reported saying \"When the coffin was lowered into the ground, Vasconcelos sobbed bitterly. At that moment he must have known and felt who he really had as a wife; perhaps they were tears of belated repentance.\" He remarried pianist Esperanza Cruz and they had a child, Héctor.\n\nAlthough Vasconcelos was interested in studying philosophy, Mexican universities during the Porfiriato focused on the sciences, influenced by French positivism. Vasconcelos attended the National Preparatory School in Mexico City, an elite high school, going on to Escuela de Jurisprudencia in Mexico City (1905). In law school, he became involved with radical students organized as the \"Ateneo de la Juventud\" (Youth Atheneum). The Ateneo de Juventud was led by a Dominican citizen, Pedro Henríquez Ureña, who had read Uruguayan essayist José Enrique Rodó's \"Ariel\", an influential work published in 1900 that was opposed to Anglo U.S. cultural influence, but also emphasized the redemptive power of education. The Anteneo de la Juventud had a diverse membership, composed of university professors, artists, other professionals, and students. Some other members included Isidro Fabela and Diego Rivera. It was opposed to the Díaz regime and formulated arguments against it and the regime's emphasis on positivism by employing French spiritualism, which articulated \"a new vision of the relationship between individual and society.\"\n\nAfter graduating from law school, he joined a law firm of Warner, John, and Galston in Washington, D.C. Vasconcelos joined the local Anti-Reelection Club in Washington, D.C.. The Anti-Reelectionistas supported the democratic movement to oust long-time President of Mexico Porfirio Díaz 1910, and headed by Francisco I. Madero, the presidential candidate of the Anti-Re-electionista Party. Vasconcelos returned to Mexico City to participate more directly in the anti-reelectionist movement, becoming one of the party's secretaries and editing its newspaper, \"El Antireelectionista\".\n\nAfter Díaz was ousted by revolutionary violence followed by the election of Madero as elected president of Mexico, Vasconcelos led a structural change at the National Preparatory School, where he changed the academic programs, breaking with the positivistic influence of the past.\n\nAfter Madero's assassination in February 1913, Vasconcelos joined the broad based movement to defeat the military regime of Victoriano Huerta. Soon after, Vasconcelos was forced into exile in Paris, where he met Julio Torri, Doctor Atl, Gabriele D'Annunzio, and other intellectuals and artists of the time. After Huerta was ousted in July 1914, Vasconcelos returned to Mexico.\n\nThe Convention of Aguascalientes in 1914, the failed attempt of the factions that defeated the Huerta regime to find a political solution, but which split the factions. Leader of the Constitutionalists, Venustiano Carranza and General Álvaro Obregón split with more radical revolutionaries, especially Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Vasconcelos chose the side of the Convention and served as Minister of Education during the brief presidential period of Eulalio Gutiérrez. Pancho Villa was defeated by the Constitutionalist Army under Obregón in the Battle of Celaya in 1915 and Vasconcelos went into exile again. Venustiano Carranza became president of Mexico (1915–1920), but was ousted and killed by the Sonoran generals that had helped put him in power.\n\nVasconcelos returned to Mexico during the interim presidency of Sonoran Adolfo de la Huerta was named rector the National Autonomous University of Mexico (1920) As rector, he had a great deal of power, but he accrued even more by ignoring the standard structures, such as the University Council, to govern the institution. Rather, he exercised personalist power, and began implementing his vision of the function of the university. He redesigned the logo of the university to show a map of Latin America, with the phrase \"Por mi raza hablará el espíritu\" (The spirit will speak for my race), an influence of Rodó's \"arielismo\". An eagle and a condor with a background of the volcanic mountains in central Mexico. Vasconcelos is said to have declared \"I have not come to govern the University but to ask the University to work for the people.\"\nWhen Álvaro Obregón became president in 1920, he created the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) in 1921 and named Vasconcelos as its head. Under Obregón, the national budget had two key expeditures; not surprisingly the military was first, but the second was education. Creating the Secretariat entailed changing the Constitution of 1917, and in order to do that, Obregón's government had to muster support from lawmakers. Vasconcelos traveled through Mexico while he was rector of the university seeking that support. The effort succeeded and Vasconcelos was named head of the new cabinet level secretariat in July 1921.\n\nDuring his tenure at SEP he was in a powerful position to implement the vision of Mexico's history, especially the Mexican Revolution.\n\nHe printed huge numbers of texts for the expanded public school system, but in the 1920s there was no agreement about how the Mexican Revolution should be portrayed, so earlier history texts by Justo Sierra, who headed the ministry of public education in the government of Porfirio Díaz continued to be used.\n\nAlthough he was no advocate of Mexican indigenous culture, as Secretary of Education he sent Brazil a statue of the last Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc for their centennial celebrations of independence in 1923, to disdain and puzzlement of the South American recipients.\n\nHe resigned in 1924 because of his opposition to President Plutarco Elías Calles. He worked in favor of the education of the masses and sought to make the nation's education secular, civic, and Pan-American (\"americanista\") lines. He ran for president in 1929 but lost to Pascual Ortiz Rubio in a controversial election and again left the country.\n\nHe later directed the National Library of Mexico (1940) and presided over the Mexican Institute of Hispanic Culture (1948).\n\nVasconcelos' first writings on philosophy are passionate reactions against the formal, positivistic education at the National Preparatory School, formerly under the influence of porfirian thinkers like Justo Sierra and Gabino Barreda.\n\nA second period of productivity was fed by a first disappointment in the political field, after Madero's murder. Then he wrote, in 1919, a long essay on Pythagorism, as a dissertation on the links between harmony and rhythm, and its eventual explanation into a frame of aesthetic monism. As he argued that only by the means of rhythm is the human being able to know the world without any intermediation, he proposed that the minimal aspects of cognition are conditioned by a degree of sympathy with the natural \"vibration\" of things. In this manner, he thought that the auditive categories of knowledge were much higher than the visual ones.\n\nDuring a later period, Vasconcelos developed an argument for the mixing of races, as a natural and desirable direction for humankind. This work, known as ('The Cosmic Race'), would eventually contribute to further studies on ethnic values as an ethic, and for the consideration of ethnic variety as an aesthetic source. Finally, between 1931 and 1940 he tried to consolidate his proposals by publishing his main topics organized in three main works: ('Metaphysics'), ('Ethics'), and ('Aesthetics').\n\nIn the final part of his life, he gradually fell into a deeply Catholic political conservatism. Before the Second World War, he began writing sympathetically about Franco, and he retracted some of his earlier liberal positions. One of his last published works, Letanías del atardecer (1957) is a pessimistic tract hinting that the use of nuclear weapons might be necessary given the post-war order.\n\nVasconcelos is often referred to as the father of the \"\" philosophy. In recent times, this philosophy has come under criticism from Native Americans because of its negative implications concerning indigenous peoples. To an extent, his philosophy argued for a new, \"modern\" mestizo people, but at the cost of cultural assimilation of all ethnic groups. His research on the nature of Mexican modern identity had a direct influence on the young writers, poets, anthropologists and philosophers who wrote on this subject. He also influenced the point of view of Carlos Pellicer with respect to several aesthetic assumptions reflected in his books. Together, Pellicer and Vasconcelos made a trip through the Middle East (1928–29), looking for the \"spiritual basis\" of Byzantine architecture.\n\nOther works, particularly and , had a decisive influence in Octavio Paz's ('The Labyrinth of Solitude'), with anthropological and aesthetic implications. Paz wrote that Vasconcelos was \"the teacher\" who had educated hundreds of young Latin American intellectuals during his many trips to Central and South America. Vasconcelos was guest lecturer at Columbia University and Princeton University, but his influence on new generations in the United States became gradually less significant. Nevertheless, his work has been used by Chicano and Mexican-American movements since the 1970s, asserting the ('retaking' or literally 'reconquest') of the American Southwest, based on their Mexican ancestry.\n\nThanks to Vasconcelos, the National Symphonic Orchestra (1920) and the Symphonic Orchestra of Mexico (1928) were officially endorsed. Muralists Diego Rivera, José Clemente Orozco, and David Alfaro Siqueiros were given the right to paint the inner walls of the most important public buildings in Mexico (e.g., the National Palace in Mexico City), creating the Mexican mural movement.\n\n\"[T]he leaders of Latin American independence ... strove to free the slaves, declared the equality of all men by natural law; the social and civic equality of whites, blacks and Indians.

The Hebrews founded the belief in their superiority on oracles and divine promises. The English found theirs on observations relative to domestic animals.

First, as a modest zoological theory, then as social biology that confers definitive preponderance to the English above all races. Every imperialism needs a justifying philosophy\".

Hitler represents, ultimately, an idea, the German idea, so often humiliated previously by French militarism and English perfidy. Truthfully, we find civilian governed 'democracies' fighting against Hitler. But they are democracies in name only\".

{"id": "56685606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56685606", "title": "Latin word order", "text": "Latin word order\n\nThe word order of classical Latin is relatively free. Subject, Object, and Verb can come in any order; adjectives and possessives can go before or after their noun, and so on. A commonly found feature of Latin is hyperbaton, in which a phrase is split up by other words, e.g. \"Sextus est Tarquinius\" \"it is Sextus Tarquinius\".\n\nA complicating factor in Latin word order is that there are variations between the style of different authors, and also between different genres of writing; in Caesar's historical writing the verb is much more likely to come at the end of the sentence than in Cicero's philosophy. The word order of poetry is even freer than prose, and examples of interleaved word order (double hyperbaton) are common.\n\nIn terms of word order typology, Latin is classified by some scholars as basically an SOV (Subject-Object-Verb) language, with Preposition-Noun, Noun-Genitive, and Adjective-Noun (but also Noun-Adjective) order. Others, however, argue that the word order of Latin is so variable that it is impossible to establish one order as more basic than another.\n\nAs will be seen in the examples below, the order of words in Latin is not random, but frequently indicates different nuances of meaning and emphasis. As the authors of \"Latin Word Order\", Devine and Stephens, put it: \"Word order is not a subject which anyone reading Latin can afford to ignore. ... Reading a paragraph of Latin without attention to word order entails losing access to a whole dimension of meaning.\"\n\nOne important advantage of studying word order in Latin is that it helps the reader to understand the author's meaning more clearly. Thus for example \"complosit Trimalchio manus\" doesn't merely mean \"Trimalchio clapped his hands\", but the initial verb implies a sudden action: \"Trimalchio suddenly clapped his hands\". In another sentence the initial verb functions as a topic: \"decessit Corellius Rufus\" doesn't mean \"Corellius Rufus has died\" but rather \"The person who has died is Corellius Rufus.\" In another sentence, the initial verb is emphatic: \"vidi forum\" doesn't simply mean \"I saw the forum\", but \"with my own eyes I saw the forum\".\n\nThe placement of adjectives also affects the emphasis. Thus \"mea fama\", with the possessive before the noun, means not \"my fame\" but \"my \"own\" fame\"; \"naves sunt combustae quinque\", with the number at the end of the sentence and separated from its noun, doesn't just mean \"five ships were burnt\" but \"no fewer than five ships were burnt\".\n\nThe use of hyperbaton (separation of words which normally go together) is also worth observing. Thus Caesar's \"hae permanserunt aquae dies complures\", with \"hae\" separated from \"aquae\" and \"complures\" at the end of the sentence, doesn't mean \"These floods remained for several days\" but \"This time the flood waters, unlike the previous ones, remained for several days\".\n\nIn the past hundred years, but especially since the advent of computerised texts, Latin word order has been extensively studied, with a view to elucidating the principles on which it is based, and establishing what nuances of meaning or emphasis could be obtained by using different word orders. Two major recent works on Latin word order, based on different approaches, are those of Devine and Stephens (2006) and Olga Spevak (2010).\n\nIt is generally agreed that pragmatic factors play a major role in Latin word order, that is, factors such as topic and focus, contrast, emphasis, and heaviness. The topic (what is being talked about) often tends to come at the beginning of the sentence, and the focus (what is said about the topic) at the end or in penultimate position.\n\nOther factors that play a role in word order are semantic (for example, adjectives of size usually precede the noun, those of material more often follow it), and in some Latin authors consideration of such matters as euphony, assonance, and rhythm.\n\nOne major area of disagreement is how far syntax plays a role in word order. According to Devine and Stephens (2006), Latin has a basic neutral word order, which they state is as follows:\n\n\nA \"non-referential object\" is one like \"impetum\" in the phrase \"impetum facere\" (\"to make an attack\") which goes closely with the verb.\n\nFollowing the theories of generative grammar, Devine and Stephens assume that deviations from this basic unmarked order are made in order to put emphasis on different elements. They use the term \"scrambling\" if constituents come in a different order from the basic one, and assume that scrambling occurs when an element is moved leftwards, towards the beginning of the sentence. This leftwards movement is called \"raising\".\n\nOlga Spevak (2010), on the other hand, basing her work on theories of functional grammar, rejects this approach. In her view, there are so many deviations from the so-called neutral order not only between authors but even in the works of the same author that it is not possible to discover what the neutral order must be; and therefore an approach which insists on a basic unmarked order \"does not really help a Latinist to better understand Latin constituent order\". She stresses that according to the principles of functional grammar, as outlined by the Dutch linguist Simon Dik, words take their positions in a sentence according to a certain template, not by being moved from elsewhere.\n\nHowever, not all scholars are ready to dismiss syntactic factors entirely. J.G.F. Powell, in his review of Spevak's book, comments that \"nobody has yet succeeded in unifying the insights of all the different scholarly approaches to the fascinating and peculiar problem of Latin word order\". In his view an approach which combines the various schools of thought on Latin word order \"may succeed in finding a more satisfactory solution\".\n\nSeveral recent books, such as those of Panhuis and Spevak, have analysed Latin sentences from a pragmatic point of view. Syntactic approaches traditionally analyse a sentence into Subject and Predicate, but a pragmatic analysis considers a sentence from the point of view of Topic and Focus (or Theme and Rheme, as Panhuis (1982) puts it). This type of approach was also proposed by Sturtevant (1909), who referred to the topic as the \"psychological subject\".\n\nAs with Subject, Object and Verb, Topic and Focus can be arranged in different ways in a sentence.\n\nThe topic is the thing or person that is being talked about in the sentence. Spevak (2010) distinguishes various kinds of topic: discourse topic, sentence topic, sub-topic, future topic, theme, and so on. A sentence topic is one that picks up the immediately preceding context (e.g. \"ad ea\" below) and has precedence over the discourse topic (\"Caesar\" below):\n\nA topic will often take precedence over a conjunction, and the following word order where the topic (in this case the grammatical subject) precedes \"cum\" \"when\" is fairly common:\n\nNot every sentence has a topic, but some present information which is entirely new. Pinkster gives the following as an example:\n\nSuch sentences are sometimes called \"presentative sentences\" and often start with a verb.\n\nThe focus is the new information, i.e. the message which is being conveyed to the listener.\n\nOften in Latin the topic comes first, and then the focus. For example, in the sentence below, the topic is \"in the bathhouse\" (\"balnearea\"), which has been previously mentioned, and the sub-topic is the hot-room (\"assa\") (since it can be assumed that all bath-houses have a hot room); the new information is that Cicero has moved the hot room, and the place to which he has moved it:\n\nSimilarly, in the following example, the new information is the sumptuousness of the funerals in question:\n\nIn the following example, where the adverb \"celeriter\" \"quickly\" is placed early in the sentence, the main information is the action \"took up arms\"; the speed is subsidiary information (Devine and Stephens use the terms \"nuclear focus\" and \"weak focus\" for this):\n\nOften the verb can be part of the topic, as in the following example. The new information, or focus, is the person who followed and the number of ships he brought:\n\nA very frequent place for the focus, however, is in penultimate position, just before the verb or another element. In the example below, Alba has been mentioned in the previous sentence, and the fact that cities have rulers can be assumed; the new information or focus is the name of the ruler at that time, Gaius Cluilius. In this sentence, as in the previous example, the verb itself acts as a topic:\n\nWhen an unemphatic argument, neither focus nor topic, such as \"Albae\" above, follows the focussed word in this way, it is known as a \"tail\".\n\nIn the following example the fact that northerly regions have winters is already known, and the new information is the fact that they come early:\n\nIn the following, the fire has already been mentioned; the new information is that it continued day and night, with the main emphasis on the fact that it was continuous:\n\nIn the following, the fact that the road has been measured can be assumed (Cicero has just mentioned the measurement); the new information is that he measured it himself:\n\nSimilarly in the following, the fact that orders were given has already been mentioned, and the fact that they were carried out can be assumed; the new information is that they were carried out quickly:\n\nIn the following, the sentence answers the unspoken question \"What did the general do with all the money he found in the captured city?\", the answer being \"He sent it to Rome\" (with \"Rome\" being the most important word):\n\nOccasionally, the focus can be given extra emphasis by being placed before the topic. In the following pair of sentences, the focus of one is at the beginning, and of the other at the end:\n\nIn the sentence below from Livy, the sentence topic (\"that year\") and discourse topic (\"the war\") are in the middle of the sentence. The fact that war was waged on both land and sea is a weak focus placed in penultimate position; but the new and surprising information is that the number of Roman legions was no fewer than 23, and this comes at the beginning of the sentence before the topic:\n\nIn the following sentence with antithesis, two topics, \"the land journey\" and \"the journey by sea\", are contrasted. Because they are contrasted, the topics are more emphatic than the focus:\n\nSimilar is the following, where the contrasted topics are \"when I was a young man\" and \"now that I am an old one\":\n\nDevine and Stephens refer to such emphatic topics used contrastively as \"co-focus\".\n\nAnother example is the following, where the phrase \"this place\" (namely the city of Laurentum which was mentioned in the previous sentence) is in the emphatic penultimate position, as though it were the focus:\n\nNo recordings exist of Latin from the classical period, but it can be assumed that differences in emphasis in Latin were shown by intonation as well as by word order.\n\nEuphony and rhythm undoubtedly played a large part in Roman writers' choice of word order, especially in oratory, but also in historians such as Livy. Statements from the writers themselves make it clear that the important consideration was the clausula or rhythm of the final few syllables of each clause.\n\nCicero himself, commenting on a speech of the tribune Gaius Carbo, quotes the sentence below, which apparently caused the audience to burst into shouts of approval:\n\nHe notes that the sentence would be ruined rhythmically if the word order of the last three words were changed to \"comprobavit fili temeritas\". What was apparently admired here was the clausula of \"comprobavit\" with its double trochaic – u – – rhythm; whereas \"temeritas\" would make a rhythm of u u u –, which Cicero says would produce an unsatisfying effect in Latin, despite being recommended by Aristotle.\n\nThe 1st-century A.D. teacher of oratory, Quintilian, remarks that hyperbaton (switching words round) is often used to make a sentence more euphonious. He gives the example of the following sentence from the opening of Cicero's \"pro Cluentio\":\n\nQuintilian says that \"in duas partis divisam esse\" would be correct, but \"harsh and inelegant\".\n\nIn another place he says that to end a sentence with the verb is best, because the verb is the most forceful part of the sentence (\"in verbis enim sermonis vis est\"); but if putting a verb finally is rhythmically harsh, the verb is frequently moved.\n\nAnother example where euphonic considerations may have played a part in word order is the following, from a letter by Pliny the Younger:\n\nSince \"hic\" was pronounced \"hicc\", the unusual order with the demonstrative following the noun produces a favourite double cretic clausula (– u – – u –). There is also a pleasing assonance of the vowels \"a-u-i a-u-i\" in the last three words.\n\nAnother factor affecting word order was the individual style of different authors. Devine and Stephens note for example that Livy is fond of putting the object after the verb at the end of the clause (e.g. \"posuit castra\" \"he placed a camp\", rather than \"castra posuit\", which Caesar preferred).\n\nOther differences between authors have been observed. For example, Caesar frequently places a number after a noun (in about 46% of cases), but this is rarer in Cicero (only 10% of cases).\n\nSeveral scholars have examined Latin sentences from a syntactic point of view, in particular the position of the verb.\n\nIn sentences with Subject, Object, and Verb, any order is possible. However, some orders are more common than others. In a sample of 568 sentences of Caesar containing all three elements examined by Pinkster, the proportions were:\n\nAn example of the typical Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order in Caesar is:\n\nA dependent infinitive, such as \"interfici\" \"to be killed\" below, also in Caesar usually precedes its verb:\n\nHowever, in other genres of Latin, especially more colloquial types such as the comic dialogues of Plautus, Cicero's letters, or Petronius's satiric novel, the final position for the verb is much less common. comments: \"In certain texts the medial position of the verb seems more normal than the final.\"\n\nLinde (1923) counted the verb final clauses in various texts and produced the following figures:\n\nIn all authors, the verb tends to be final more often in subordinate clauses than in main clauses.\n\nOver the centuries, verb-final main clauses became less common. In the writing of Egeria (Aetheria) of about A.D. 380, only 25% of main clauses and 37% of subordinate clauses are verb-final.\n\nThe verb \"sum\" \"I am\" (or its parts) is an exception to the rule that verbs tend to come at the end of the sentence in Caesar and Cicero. According to one investigation, in Caesar, when the verb is \"sum\", only 10% of main clauses end with the verb. With other verbs, the figure is 90%.\n\nIn Cicero the verb \"sum\" is used at the end of a sentence slightly more often, in 20%–35% of main clauses. However, this is less than with other verbs, for which the figure is 55%–70%.\n\nThe above figures apply to sentences where \"sum\" is used as in independent verb (e.g. \"difficile est\" \"it is difficult\"), rather than as an auxiliary to another verb (e.g. \"profectus est\" \"he set out\"), when it frequently ends the clause.\n\nDifferent authors have different preferences. In Sallust, who has a rather conservative style, the verb \"sum\" (except where existential) tends to go at the end of the sentence. Cato also usually puts the verb \"sum\" finally, except in specificational and identity sentences, such as the following:\n\nQuite commonly, especially in certain authors such as Nepos and Livy, the verb can come in penultimate position, followed by the object, as in this example:\n\nThis stylistic feature, consisting of Verb + Object at the end of a clause, is referred to by Devine and Stephens as \"V-bar syntax\". It is much less common in Caesar than in Livy. In Caesar the phrase \"castra posuit/ponit\" \"placed a camp\" always comes in that order, but in Livy it is found as \"posuit castra\" in 45 out of 55 examples (82%).\n\nEven in Caesar, however, it is not uncommon for a locative phrase of goal or source to follow the verb, especially when the locative is focussed:\n\nOther prepositional phrases can also sometimes follow the verb:\n\nOther types of phrases which can sometimes follow a verb are relative clauses:\n\nDependent clauses with \"ut\" almost always follow the verb:\n\nAnother kind of situation where the verb commonly comes in penultimate position is when it is followed by a strongly focussed negative pronoun such as \"nemo\" \"no one\" or \"quisquam\" \"anyone\":\n\nThe grammatical subject can come after the verb in sentences of the following kind where it is focussed, and the verb itself forms part of the topic:\n\nSimilarly in sentences such as the following, it is reasonable to suppose that the object is focussed:\n\nThis type of sentence where the focus is on the object at the end should be distinguished from sentences with V-bar syntax such as \"circumscripsit regem\" \"he drew a circle round the king\" mentioned above, in which the object is not focussed.\n\nInitial verbs are often used in sentences such as the following, which describe a sudden or immediate consequence of a previous event:\n\nSuch sentences are of a type known as \"thetic\" sentences, which answer \"What happened?\" rather than \"What did the subject do?\" Frequently they are in the historic present tense (in Caesar the historic present is six times as common in verb-initial sentences as the perfect tense).\n\nSometimes, even if the verb does not come at the beginning, the suddenness of the action can be shown by raising it partially. Thus the final words of this sentence, which would normally be \"de loco superiore impetum faciunt\" \"they make an attack from higher ground\", are changed to \"faciunt de loco superiore impetum\" to emphasise the element of surprise:\n\nThe agent of the verb in thetic sentences tends to be less important than the verb; consequently, verb-initial sentences often have a verb in the passive voice. In Caesar, the passive verb \"mittitur\" (\"is sent\") is much commoner sentence-initially than \"mittit\" (\"he sends\"):\n\nIntransitive verbs of the type called unaccusative verbs, that is, verbs which have no voluntary agent, such as \"maneo\" \"remain\", \"cresco\" \"grow\", \"sto\" \"stand\", \"pateo\" \"be open\", \"mano\" \"spread\", also often begin thetic sentences:\n\nThetic sentences with initial verb can also be explanatory or give background information:\n\nPresentational verbs (e.g. \"erat\" \"there was\") are also usually sentence-initial:\n\nA verb at the beginning of the sentence is often emphatic, perhaps expressing something surprising:\n\nAnother situation favouring initial verb position is where the verb is in contrastive focus (antithesis), as in the following:\n\nThe verbs also come initially in sentences like the one below, in which there is a double antithesis. These are examples of sentences with initial focus (see above):\n\nAnother reason for using a sentence-initial verb is when the speaker is emphatically asserting the truth of a fact:\n\nVerbs with meanings such as \"move\", \"offend\", \"make anxious\" etc., known as \"psych\" verbs, also often come sentence-initially. In Livy, the verb \"movit\" (\"moved\") frequently (although not always) comes first if it is used in the metaphorical sense:\n\nBut when the sense is literal, it always come finally:\n\nAnother reason for putting the verb first is that it represents the topic of the sentence, while the grammatical subject which follows it is the focus. For example, after mentioning that he has been upset by the death of someone, Pliny goes on to say:\n\nOther examples of this are given above in the section on topic and focus.\n\nAn initial verb can also be used (without emphasis) in yes-no questions:\n\nImperatives also often (but not always) come at the beginning of a sentence:\n\nThe verb \"sum\" (\"I am\") can be used as an auxiliary verb (e.g. \"interfectus est\" \"he was killed\"), as a copula (e.g. \"dives erat\" \"he was rich\") or as an existential verb, specifying the existence of something.\n\nAs an existential verb, \"est\" (or its past tense \"erat\") often goes at the beginning of the sentence:\n\nOf these two orders, the first (with the locative phrase between the verb and the noun) is by far the most common. The second example above is unusual in that it does not present new information but merely reminds the reader of what has already been said (\"There was a valley, as mentioned above...\").\n\nIn other sentences, the verb \"est\" or \"erat\" follows the word which it is presenting, or comes in the middle of a phrase in hyperbaton:\n\nWhen \"est\" is an auxiliary, it normally follows the participle which it is used with:\n\nSometimes, however, the auxiliary can move forward to follow some significant item of information, such as a quantity phrase or focussed word:\n\nIn subordinate clauses the auxiliary frequently raises to the position directly after the conjunction or relative pronoun:\n\nBut if there is a focus word following the conjunction or relative pronoun, the auxiliary follows that and does not raise to the second position:\n\nIn a negative sentence, the auxiliary tends to attach itself to the word \"non\", and does not move forward of it. \"Non est\" can either precede or follow the participle:\n\nWhen \"est\" is a copula, it tends to be unemphatic and to be placed after a stronger word, or between two strong words:\n\nThis strong word which \"est\" follows can also be the subject:\n\nIt is also possible for the subject to follow the copula:\n\nOr the order may be Adjective, Subject, Copula:\n\nIn some sentences, the copula may begin the sentence:\n\nWhen the sentence is negative, however, the verb \"est\" follows \"non\" and tends to be clause-final:\n\nIn Latin, an adjective can either precede or follow its noun: for example, \"a good man\" can be both \"bonus vir\" or \"vir bonus\". Some kinds of adjectives are more inclined to follow the noun, others to precede, but \"the precise factors conditioning the variation are not always obvious\".\n\nIn Caesar and Cicero, it has been found that the majority (60%–80%) of ordinary adjectives, not counting pronominals and numerals, precede their nouns.\n\nOne factor affecting the order is semantic. As a general rule, adjectives which express an inherent property of the noun, such as \"gold\" in \"gold ring\", tend to follow it. Where the adjective is more salient or important than the noun, as \"Appian\" in \"Appian Way\" (\"via Appia\"), it also tends to follow it.\n\nAdjectives which express a subjective evaluation, such as \"gravis\" \"serious\", on the other hand, usually go before the noun. Adjectives of size and quantity also usually precede (in 91% of examples in Caesar, 83% in Cicero), as do demonstrative adjectives such as \"hic\" \"this\" and \"ille\" \"that\" (99% in Caesar, 95% in Cicero).\n\nAdjectives where there is a choice between two alternatives, such as \"left\" or \"right\", or \"preceding\" and \"following\", also tend to go before the noun. However, the opposite order (e.g. \"manu sinistra\" \"with left hand\", Catullus 12) is also found.\n\nOther factors such as focus and contrast may also affect the order. When there is contrastive focus the adjective will precede, even if it is one such as a geographical name which normally follows:\n\nEven when the contrast is not explicit, a strong focus may cause the adjective to come first:\n\nOn the other hand, an adjective which normally precedes, such as a number, can follow the noun when it is focussed or emphasised:\n\nContrast the following, where the emphasis is on \"triremes\":\n\nOver time the position of adjectives can be seen changing, for example, between Cato the Elder (2nd century BC) and Columella (1st century AD). Adjectives describing the type of something, such as \"ligneus\" \"wooden\", \"olearius\" \"designed for oil\" or \"novus\" \"new\" always follow the noun in Cato, but can come either before or after in Columella.\n\nIn Cato, the adjective \"magnus\" \"big\" follows its noun in 7 out of 9 examples, e.g. \"tempestates magnas\" \"big storms\", but in Caesar about 95% of examples go before the noun.\n\nLivy uses this antique word order at a dramatic moment in his history when he reports the words of the magistrate announcing the news of the disaster at the battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC:\n\nAnother adjective which changes over time is \"omnis\" \"all\". In Cato this word goes before or after the noun with equal frequency, but in Cicero's speeches 80% of the time it precedes, and in Caesar it goes before the noun even more commonly.\n\nAs with other aspects of word order, stylistic preferences also play a part in adjective order. For example, the adjective \"superior\" in its literal sense of \"higher\" (e.g. \"ex loco superiore\" \"from a higher place\") usually comes after the noun in Cicero and in Caesar, but in Livy the position before the noun (\"ex superiore loco\") is much commoner. Vitruvius and Seneca the Younger also preferred the earlier position.\n\nIn certain commonly used phrases, the adjective comes after the noun without variation: \n\nIn others, the position after the noun is more common but not fixed. The phrase \"bellum civile\" \"civil war\" has the adjective following in about 60% of Cicero's examples.\n\nIn other commonly used phrases, the adjective always comes first. These include certain terms of relative position and certain adjectives of time:\n\nIn other common phrases, such as \"prima luce\" \"at first light\", the adjective usually comes first, but \"luce prima\" is also found.\n\nOften adjectives are emphasised by separating them from the noun by other words (a technique known as hyperbaton). This is especially true of adjectives of size and quantity, but also superlatives, comparatives, demonstratives, and possessives.\n\nOften the adjective precedes the noun:\n\nThe separation can sometimes be a long one:\n\nPremodifying adjectives in hyperbaton often have focus or contrastive emphasis. In the following example, \"these particular\" floods are contrasted with some earlier ones which lasted a shorter time:\n\nSometimes they are merely brought to the front to emphasise them. So in the following example, the adjective \"cruentum\" \"bloody\" is raised to the beginning of the sentence to highlight it and make it stand out:\n\nSometimes both the noun and the adjective are important or focussed:\n\nThis last sentence is an example of double hyperbaton, since \"omnium ... animis\" \"everyone's minds\" is an example of genitive hyperbaton.\n\nHyperbaton is also possible when the adjective follows the noun. Often with postmodifier hyperbaton, the noun is indefinite:\n\nIf the noun is definite, the adjective can be predicative:\n\nSometimes the noun, not the adjective, is focussed, and the adjective is a mere tail, as in the following:\n\nCardinal numbers tend to come before the noun in Cicero (90% of examples), but in Caesar only 54% come before the noun. When following the noun, the numeral is often focussed, as in the following, where the important information is in the number \"three\":\n\nDistributive or \"pluralia tantum\" numerals usually precede the noun, both in Cicero and Caesar:\n\nOrdinals precede the noun in 73% of Caesar's examples. But when used with \"hora\", they follow:\n\nPossessive adjectives, such as \"meus\" \"my\", \"suus\" \"his/their\", are fairly evenly distributed (68% preceding in Caesar, 56% in a sample of Cicero speeches). When a possessive follows the noun it is unemphatic:\n\nWhen it is more emphatic, or in contrastive focus, it precedes:\n\nHowever, the possessive adjective preceding the noun is not always emphatic: when it is tucked away between two more emphatic words it is usually unemphatic:\n\nIt is also usual for the possessive to precede the noun when vocative:\n\nThe 3rd person genitive pronouns, \"eius\" \"his\" and \"eorum\" \"their\", tend to precede their noun in Caesar (in 73% of instances). Unlike the possessive adjectives, however, there is often no particular emphasis when they are used before a noun:\n\nWith certain nouns, such as \"frater eius\" \"his brother\" or \"familiaris eius\" \"his friend\", however, the position after the noun is slightly more usual.\n\nPronominal adjectives are those which can serve both as pronouns and adjectives, such as \"hic\" \"this\", \"alius\" \"another\", \"quidam\" \"a certain (man)\" and so on. These adjectives generally have genitive singular \"-ius\" and dative singular \"-i\".\n\nThe most frequent position for pronominal adjectives is before the noun.\n\nDemonstratives, such as \"ille\" (\"that\") and \"hic\" (\"this\"), almost always precede the noun in both in Caesar (99%) and in Cicero's speeches (95%).\n\nWhen it follows a noun in unemphatic position, \"hic\" can often mean \"the aforementioned\":\n\nIn the same way, when it follows a noun, \"ille\" can sometimes mean \"that famous\":\n\nBut more frequently, even when it means \"the aforementioned\", and also when it means \"this one here\", \"hic\" will precede the noun:\n\nThe pronouns \"alius\" \"another\", \"alter\" \"another (of two)\", \"ullus\" \"any\", and \"nullus\" \"no\", when used adjectivally, precede the noun in most cases (93% in both Caesar and Cicero).\n\n\"in another place\"\n\nOccasionally, however, when emphatic, they may follow:\n\nIn the following, there is a chiasmus (ABBA order):\n\n\"Ipse\" in phrases such as \"ipse Alexander\" (\"Alexander himself\") usually precedes the noun in Caesar, as also in Cicero, although Cicero's preference is not as strong.\n\nThe word \"quidam\" \"a certain\" can either precede or follow its noun: \n\nWhen it is used with a person's name, it always follows, or else goes between forename and surname:\n\nIn such a position it is unemphatic, and the emphasis is on the name.\n\nThe other indefinite pronoun, \"aliqui\" (the adjectival form of \"aliquis\"), similarly can either follow or precede its noun:\n\nOf these two, the phrase \"aliquam partem\" is slightly more common; and the phrase \"aliquo modo\" \"somehow or other\" is always in that order.\n\nIt is been noted that in various languages when more than one adjective precedes a noun, they tend to come in a particular order. In English the order usually given is: Determiner > Number > Opinion > Size > Quality > Age > Shape > Colour > Participle forms > Origin > Material > Type > Purpose (for example, \"those two large brown Alsatian guard dogs\"). In general an adjective expressing a non-permanent state (such as \"hot\") will go further from the noun than an adjective of type or material which expresses an inherent property of the object.\n\nIn Latin, when adjectives precede, they generally have the same order as in English: \n\nWhen the adjectives follow, the opposite order is usually used:\n\nThere are some apparent exceptions, however, such as the following, in which the adjective \"sumptuosam\" \"luxurious\" is placed next to the noun:\n\nThe demonstrative \"hic\" \"this\" normally goes before a number, as in English. However, the reverse order is also possible:\n\nWhen \"hic\" follows a noun, it goes close to it:\n\nAdjectives of the same semantic class are usually joined by a conjunction in Latin:\n\nQuite commonly also, one adjective precedes and another follows, as in:\n\nWhen a preposition, adjective and noun are used together, this order is the most common one (75% of Caesar's examples):\n\nMore rarely, a monosyllabic preposition may come between an adjective and noun in hyperbaton:\n\nHowever, this is mainly true only of the prepositions \"cum\", \"de\", \"ex\", and \"in\" and mainly with interrogatives and relatives and a limited number of adjectives.\n\nThe order preposition, noun, adjective is also less common:\n\nJust as with adjectives, a genitive such as \"hostium\" \"of the enemies\" can either precede or follow its head-noun. Thus for \"camp of the enemies\", both \"castra hostium\" and \"hostium castra\" are found. Overall, however, there is a slight tendency for a genitive to come after a noun in both Caesar and Cicero (57% of examples).\n\nIndividual preferences play a part in genitive position. In Livy books 1–10, \"castra hostium\" \"the camp of the enemies\" (74% of examples) is more common than \"hostium castra\". Caesar, on the other hand, seems to prefer \"hostium castra\" (69% of examples). But when a name is used with \"castra\", Caesar usually puts it after the noun (86% of examples), for example \"castra Labieni\" \"Labienus's camp\".\n\nWith relationship terms, such as \"uxor\" \"wife\", the genitive can go either before or after the noun. Often when it follows, the genitive is unemphatic:\n\nOften (but not always) when the genitive precedes, it is focussed:\n\nOne noun which almost always has a preceding genitive is \"filius/filia\" \"son/daughter\":\n\nWhen the genitive is an objective one, e.g. \"spem victoriae\" \"hope of victory\" or \"conservatorem Asiae\" \"the saviour of Asia\", it normally follows the noun. However, considerations of focus or emphasis can cause it to precede:\n\nSubjective genitives can precede or follow the noun. For example, with \"memoria\" \"memory\", a subjective genitive usually (but not always) precedes:\n\nHowever, with \"spes\" \"hope\", a subjective genitive usually follows, unless focussed:\n\nIf a phrase has both a subjective and objective genitive, the subjective one (whether it comes before or after the noun) will usually precede the objective one:\n\nPartitive genitives usually follow the noun:\n\nHowever, the genitive can also sometimes precede, especially if it is a topic or sub-topic:\n\nAnother place a genitive is often found is between an adjective and the head-noun, especially when the adjective is an emphatic one such as \"omnis\" \"all\":\n\nThis also applies when a participle is used instead of an adjective:\n\nThe orders Adjective-Noun-Genitive and Adjective-Genitive-Noun are both common in Caesar and Cicero; but Genitive-Adjective-Noun is infrequent.\n\nThere are certain words that are enclitic, that is to say, they always follow a stronger word. Typical of these are \"enim\" \"for\", \"autem\" \"however, moreover\", and \"vero\" \"indeed\", which virtually always come after the first full word of the sentence (not counting prepositions), never first.\n\nOther words which require a stronger word to lean on are \"quoque\" \"also\" and \"quidem\" \"indeed\". These can never begin a sentence, therefore. Other words, such as \"fere\" \"approximately\" and \"etiam\", are frequently enclitic:\n\nIn the phrase \"ne ... quidem\" \"not even\", the word \"quidem\" generally follows the first word of the emphasised phrase, rather than the whole phrase:\n\nPersonal pronouns such as \"me\" \"me\" and \"mihi\" \"to me\" can have weak and strong forms in Latin. When weak they tend to be found early in the sentence, either after the first word (which can be a conjunction such as \"cum\" \"when\" or \"et\" \"and\") or after an enclitic such as \"enim\", if present:\n\nContrast sentences like the following, where the indirect object is a full noun, and follows the direct object (which according to Devine and Stephens is the neutral word order):\n\nUnlike true enclitics, however, pronouns can also sometimes begin a sentence:\n\nAs with the copula \"est\" (see above), when a focus phrase or emphatic delayed topic phrase intervenes, the weak pronoun will usually follow that, rather than the first word of the sentence:\n\nHowever, sometimes the pronoun will be found in second position, leaving \"est\" to follow the focussed phrase:\n\nAnd in the following example, the pronoun follows not the focussed word, but the conjunction \"si\" \"if\":\n\nIn terms of transformational grammar, the sentence can be analysed as being derived from *\"si tuus parens haec tibi diceret\" by raising \"haec\" and \"tibi\" to earlier in the sentence. A functionalist, on the other hand, would say that \"haec\" naturally comes first as the topic, then \"si\" in its normal place, then the unemphatic pronoun, without anything being moved.\n\n\n\n"}

Notably, it moves beyond the older field’s emphasis on judges, courts, and formal legal systems. New legal realism examines law in people’s everyday lives, using an interdisciplinary combination of current social science methods, including qualitative, quantitative, and experimental approaches. It is characterized by a “ground-level up” perspective, which focuses on laypeople’s experiences with law as well as studying legal professionals and formal institutions. Research methods are chosen according to evolving research questions, responding to changing understandings as knowledge accumulates. This and other features of NLR fit well with the American pragmatist philosophical tradition. Some NLR scholars view their pragmatist approach as a way of bridging between more objective social science (describing how it \"is') and more normative policy goals (how it \"ought\" to be).\n\nIn addition, NLR takes “law on the books” seriously as a subject of study, including it as part of the overall system of law. The goal of NLR is to build an integrated social science research program on law that combines multiple methods and objects of study to give policymakers the most complete possible picture of how law operates. This includes non-instrumental uses of law. Some NLR scholars have focused on how to create the best translations of social science for law, based on the idea that law has its own priorities and special language that have to be taken into account (in addition to the technical and field-specific languages and approaches of the social sciences, which also create translation challenges of their own)(see, for example, the original LSI and Wisconsin Law Review symposia, and also subsequent NLR publications).\n\nThe first New Legal Realist Conference held in North America took place in Madison, Wisconsin in June 2004. The Conference was jointly funded by the American Bar Foundation, an independent social science research institute in Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin Law School’s Institute for Legal Studies, a center for interdisciplinary research on law. Scholars from these two institutions as well as from Harvard Law School and Emory Law School held initial meetings to plan for the conference.\n\nPrior to this conference, several different strands of new legal realist thought were emerging in the U.S. legal and sociolegal academic communities. In 1997, a group of scholars sponsored a panel entitled “Is It Time for a New Legal Realism?” at the 1997 Law and Society Association Meetings in St. Louis, Missouri. The panel drew a large audience of sociolegal researchers, who debated the issues involved in achieving high-quality translations of qualitative and quantitative empirical research in legal settings. One particular topic of discussion was the sometimes difficult relationship between scholarly traditions in the social sciences and in the legal academy. This strand of new legal realist thought led to the Madison conference, and to the first collaborative publication of research by a peer-reviewed social science journal (\"Law & Social Inquiry\") and a student-edited law review (Wisconsin Law Review). These two publications examined problems such as poverty, globalization, and discrimination from the combined perspectives of law and social science, focusing on developing better methods for interdisciplinary translation.\n\nAlso in 1997, political scientist Frank Cross published an article entitled “Political Science and the New Legal Realism” and legal philosopher Brian Tamanaha wrote a book on pragmatism and “realistic socio-legal theory” The strand of new legal realist thought that originated with Cross examines judicial behavior using quantitative methods. Tamanaha is concerned with bringing the philosophical foundations provided by pragmatist theory to bear on sociolegal research.\n\nSince 1997, there have been numerous events and publications focusing on New Legal Realism. After the initial NLR conference in 2004, subsequent NLR conferences have focused on methodology, on the relationship between empirical research and legal theory, on legal approaches to poverty and land ownership, on the legal treatment of gender-related issues in employment, and on statutory interpretation. NLR scholarship has been presented in panels at the annual meetings of the Association of American Law Schools and the Law & Society Association. NLR scholars were active in forming a collaborative research network, supported by the Law and Society Association, focusing on “Realist and Empirical Legal Methods.”\n\nNew legal realist scholars utilize empirical methodologies to examine discrimination, judicial decision making, global law, and other topics (see Further Readings section below). In the United States, several strands of New Legal Realism have been identified.. In particular, one dominant strand of the US New Legal Realist literature calls for a \"bottom up\" approach in which scholars pay attention to law on the ground, in everyday lives, using qualitative as well as quantitative methods. In 2005, Erlanger et al. called for using \"bottom up\" as well as \"top down\" empirical research. Early symposia in US New Legal Realism demonstrated their \"bottom up\" approach by presenting actual examples of this kind of research in areas such as discrimination law and its effects in actual life, globalization and law, and law practice. By contrast, another strand proceeds using a more exclusively \"top down\" approach, focusing on courts and judicial opinions, and generally using quantitative methods. Scholars in Scandinavia are also returning to an interest in legal realism, building on their own earlier legal realist tradition. In May 2012, the first European conference on new legal realism was held in Copenhagen, bringing together an international group of scholars from a variety of disciplines. The conference was organized by Jakob v. H. Holtermann, Mikael Rask Madsen, and Henrik Palmer Olsen. In 2014, the 10th Anniversary U.S. NLR Conference was held at the University of California-Irvine Law School.\n\n\nGENERAL:\n\nSTUDIES OF DISCRIMINATION AND LAW:\n\nSTUDIES OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION:\n\nSTUDIES OF JUDICIAL DECISIONMAKING:\n\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW:\n\n"}

Swadhyaya is a self-study process based on the Bhagavad Gita which has spread across nearly 100,000 villages in India, with five million adherents. He was also noted for his discourses on the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Upanishads.\n\nPandurang Vaijnath Athavale was born on 19 October 1920 in Chittapavan Bramhin Family in the village of Roha in Maharashtra (Konkan), India. He was one of five children born to the Sanskrit teacher Vaijanath Shastri Athavale and his wife Parvati Athavale.\n\nWhen Athavale was twelve years old, his grandfather set up an independent course of study for the young boy. Thus, Athavale was taught in a system very similar to that of the Tapovan system of ancient India. In 1942, he started to give discourses at the \"Srimad Bhagavad Gita Pathshala,Madhavbaug,Mumbai\", a center set up by his father in 1926.\n\nAthavale read diligently in the Royal Asiatic Library for a period of 14 years; at a young age, he was well-known to have read every piece of non-fiction literature (ranging from Marx's philosophy to Whitehead's writings to ancient Indian philosophy). In 1954, he attended the Second World Philosophers' Conference, held in Japan. There, Athavale presented the concepts of Vedic ideals and the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Many participants were impressed by his ideas but wanted evidence of such ideals being put into practice in India. Nobel Prize–winning physicist Dr. Arthur Holly Compton was particularly enchanted with Athavale's ideas and offered him a lucrative opportunity in the United States, where he could spread his ideas. Athavale politely declined, saying that he had much to accomplish in his native India, where he planned to demonstrate to the world a model community peacefully practicing and spreading Vedic thoughts and the message of the Bhagavad Gita.\n\nSwadhyaya Parivar established itself in India in 1978 with adherents meeting every Sunday, where prayers were sung and a video recording of Athavale was played. Swadhyaya, which closely translate to \"in depth study of the self\" is a process based upon Vedic philosophy, and the members of the Parivar are called \"Swadhyayees\". Over the years, Athavale's followers have taken the Bhagawad Gita's concepts of Indwelling God and God's universal love, to millions of people: transcending caste, socioeconomic barriers, and religious differences. Rev. Athavale personally visited tens of thousands of villages (on foot and rented bicycles), and his adherents have followed suit to roughly 100,000 villages across India, and at least 34 nations across the globe. In these villages, Rev. Athavale started various experiments (Prayogs) to impart social activism by means of a god-centric devotion, including cooperative farming, fishing and tree-planting projects in the spirit of collective, divine labor (bhakti), somewhat similar to the Antigonish movement in Canada. Swadhyayees aim to fulfill Rev. Athavale's vision of eradicating the world's problems by creating a global family united under the principle of a universal blood maker. He felt that the universality of the Bhagavad Gita allows for it to a guide to all of humanity. As such, it's thoughts should reach unto the last person. Today, the millions of adherents can be found on every habitable continent in over 35 countries including the Caribbean, Americas, Asia, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Middle East and Africa. It is the Swadhyaya Parivar's mission to complete Rev. Athavale's vision of a \"Universal Brotherhood under the Divine Fatherhood of God.\"\n\nRev. Athavale died at the age of 83 of cardiac arrest on 25 October 2003, in Mumbai, India. He was cremated on the evening of 26 October at Tatvajnana Vidyapeeth in the Thane district, where hundreds of thousands of mourners had paid their respects to him over a period of 24 hours. Subsequently, his ashes were immersed at Ujjain, Pushkar, Haridwar, Kurukshetra, Gaya, Jagannath Puri, and lastly at Rameshwaram.\n\nIn 1991 Shyam Benegal created and directed the film \"Antarnaad\" (The Inner Voice), based on Rev. Athavale's Swadhyaya movements or Prayogs, starring Shabana Azmi and Kulbhushan Kharbanda, among others. In 2004 Abir Bazaz directed the documentary \"Swadhyaya\", based on the life and works of Rev. Athavale.\n\n\nHe was awarded the Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion in 1997 and the Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1996 for \"Community Leadership\", along with India's second highest civilian honour, the Padma Vibhushan Award, in 1999.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1385364", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1385364", "title": "Philippa Foot", "text": "Philippa Foot\n\nPhilippa Ruth Foot, FBA (; née Bosanquet; 3 October 1920 3 October 2010) was a British philosopher. She was one of the founders of contemporary virtue ethics, inspired by the ethics of Aristotle. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and 1960s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize Aristotelian ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern deontological and utilitarian ethics. Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of normative ethics within analytic philosophy, especially her critique of consequentialism and of non-cognitivism. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the trolley problem. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of Wittgenstein, although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him. She was the granddaughter of American President Grover Cleveland.\n\nBorn as Philippa Ruth Bosanquet, Foot was the daughter of Esther Cleveland (1893–1980) and Captain William Sidney Bence Bosanquet (1893–1966) of the Coldstream Guards of the British Army. Her paternal grandfather was the barrister and judge, Sir Frederick Albert Bosanquet, Common Serjeant of London from 1900 to 1917. Her maternal grandfather was the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, Grover Cleveland.\n\nFoot was educated privately and at Somerville College, Oxford, 1939–42, where she obtained a first class in Philosophy, Politics and Economics ('PPE'). Her association with Somerville, interrupted only by government service as an economist from 1942 to 1947, continued for the rest of her life. She was a lecturer in Philosophy, 1947–50, fellow and tutor, 1950–69, senior research fellow, 1969–88, and honorary fellow, 1988–2010. She spent many hours there in debate with G.E.M. Anscombe, who persuaded her that non-cognitivism was misguided.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s Foot held a number of visiting professorships in the United States – at Cornell, MIT, Berkeley, City University of New York. She was appointed Griffin Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1976 and taught there until 1991, dividing her time between the United States and England.\n\nContrary to common belief, Foot was not a founder of Oxfam and joined the organization about 6 years after its foundation. She was an atheist.\nShe was once married to the historian M. R. D. Foot, and at one time shared a flat with the novelist Iris Murdoch. She died in 2010, on her 90th birthday.\n\nFoot's works of the late 1950s were meta-ethical in character: that is, they pertained to the status of moral judgment and speech. The essays \"Moral Arguments\" and \"Moral Beliefs\", in particular, were crucial in overturning the rule of non-cognitivism in analytic approaches to ethical theory in the preceding decades.\n\nThe non-cognitivist approach may already be found in Hume, but it was given its most influential analytic formulations in works of A. J. Ayer, C. L. Stevenson, and R. M. Hare. These writers focused on so-called \"thin ethical concepts\" such as \"good\" and \"bad\" and \"right\" and \"wrong,\" arguing that they are not employed to affirm something true of the thing in question, but rather, to express an emotion or (in Hare's case) an imperative.\n\nThis sort of analysis of \"thin\" ethical concepts was tied to a special partitioning account of more concrete or \"thick\" concepts, such as \"cowardly\", \"cruel\", or \"gluttonous.\" These were supposed to combine a non-cognitive \"evaluative\" element with the obvious, \"merely descriptive\" element.\n\nFoot's purpose was to criticize this distinction and the underlying account of thin concepts. Because of the particular way she approached the defense of the cognitive and truth-evaluable character of moral judgment, these essays were crucial in bringing the question of the rationality of morality to the fore.\n\nPractical considerations involving \"thick\" ethical concepts – \"but it would be cruel\", \"it would be cowardly\", \"it's hers\", or \"I promised her I wouldn't\" – move people to act one way rather than another, but they are as descriptive as any other judgment pertaining to human life. They differ from thought such as \"it would be done on a Tuesday\" or \"it would take about three gallons of paint\", not by the admixture of what she considers to be any non-factual, attitude-expressing \"moral\" element, but by the fact that human beings have reasons not to do things that are cowardly or cruel.\n\nHer lifelong devotion to this question appears in all periods of her work.\n\nIt is on this question – the \"why be moral?\" question (which for her may be said to divide into the questions \"why be just?\", \"why be temperate?\", etc.) – that her doctrine underwent a surprising series of reversals. In \"Moral Beliefs,\" she had argued that the received virtues – courage, temperance, justice, and so on – are cultivated rationally, and that it was thus rational to act in accordance with them. The \"thick\" ethical concepts that she emphasized (without using this expression) in her defense of the cognitive character of moral judgment were associated with such rationally cultivated traits, i.e. virtues; this is how they differ from randomly chosen descriptions of action. The crucial point was that the difference between \"just action\" and \"action performed on Tuesday\" (for example) was not a matter of \"emotive\" meaning, as in Ayer and Stevenson, or a secret imperatival feature, as in Hare.\n\nFifteen years later, in the essay \"Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives\", she reversed this when it came to justice and benevolence, that is, the virtues that especially regard other people. Although everyone has reason to cultivate courage, temperance and prudence, whatever the person desires or values, still, the rationality of just and benevolent acts must, she thought, turn on contingent motivations. Although many found the thesis shocking, on her (then) account, it is meant to be, in a certain respect, inspiring: in a famous reinterpretation of a remark of Kant, she says that \"we are not conscripts in the army of virtue, but volunteers\"; the fact that we have nothing to say in proof of the irrationality of at least some unjust people should not alarm us in our own defense and cultivation of justice and benevolence: \"it did not strike the citizens of Leningrad that their devotion to the city and its people during the terrible years of the siege was contingent\".\n\nHer book \"Natural Goodness\" attempts a different line. The question what we have most reason to do, is tied to the idea of the good working of practical reason. This, in turn, is tied to the idea of the species of an animal as providing a measure of good and bad in the operations of its parts and faculties. Just as one has to know what kind of animal one is dealing with in order, for instance, to decide whether its eyesight is good or bad, the question of whether a subject's practical reason is well developed, depends on the kind of animal it is. (This idea is developed in the light of a conception of animal kinds or species as implicitly containing \"evaluative\" content, which may be criticized on contemporary biological grounds; although it is arguable, even on that basis, that it is very deeply entrenched in human cognition.) In our case, what makes for a well-constituted practical reason, depends on the fact that we are human beings characterized by certain possibilities of emotion and desire, a certain anatomy, neurological organization, and so forth.\n\nOnce this step is made, it becomes possible to argue for the rationality of moral considerations in a new way. Humans begin with the conviction that justice is a genuine virtue. Thus, the conviction that the well-constituted human practical reason operates with considerations of justice, means that \"taking account of other people in that sort of way\" is \"how human beings live together.\" (The thought that this is how they live must be understood in a sense that is compatible with the fact that actual individuals often do not – just as dentists understand the thought that \"human beings have n teeth\" in a way that is compatible with many people having fewer). There is nothing incoherent in the thought that practical calculation that takes account of others and their good might characterize some kind of rational and social animal.\n\nSimilarly, of course, there is nothing incoherent in the idea of a form of rational life within which such considerations are alien; where they can only be imposed by damaging and disturbing the individual person. There is nothing analytic about the rationality of justice and benevolence. Rather, human conviction that justice is a virtue and that considerations of justice are genuine reasons for action, is the conviction that the kind of rational being that we are, namely, human beings, is of the first type. There is no reason to think such a kind of rational animality is impossible, so there is no reason to suspect that considerations of justice are frauds.\n\nOf course, it might be suggested that this is precisely not the case, that human beings are of the second kind, and thus that the justice and benevolence we esteem are artificial and false. Foot would hold that considerations of machismo and lady-likeness are artificial and false; they are matters of \"mere convention,\" which tend to put one off of the main things. That being how it is with justice, was the position of the Platonic \"immoralists\" Callicles and Thrasymachus, and that being how it is with benevolence, was the view of Friedrich Nietzsche.\n\nIn the case of Callicles and Nietzsche, this apparently is to be shown by claiming that justice and benevolence, respectively, can be inculcated only by warping the emotional apparatus of the individual. Foot's book ends by attempting to defuse the evidence Nietzsche brings against what might be called, the common sense position. She proceeds by accepting his basic premise that a way of life that can only be inculcated by damaging the individual's passions, filling one with remorse, resentment, and so forth, is not true. She employs exactly the Nietzschean form of argument against certain forms of femininity, for example, or exaggerated forms of acceptance of etiquette. Justice and benevolence, she claims, however, \"suit\" human beings, and there is no reason to accept the critique of Callicles or Nietzsche in this case.\n\nNearly all Foot's published work relates to normative or meta-ethics. Only once did she move across the boundary into aesthetics. This was in her 1970 British Academy Hertz Memorial Lecture, \"Art and Morality\", in which certain contrasts are drawn between moral and aesthetic judgements.\n\nLikewise, she appears never to have taken a professional interest in political philosophy. Geoffrey Thomas, of Birkbeck College, London, recalls approaching Foot in 1968, when he was a postgraduate student at Trinity College, Oxford, to ask if she would read a draft paper on the relation of ethics to politics. 'I've never found political philosophy interesting', she said. She added, 'One's bound to interest oneself in the things people around one are talking about', with the implication, perfectly correct, that political philosophy was largely out of favour with Oxford philosophers in the 1950s and 1960s. She still graciously agreed to read the paper. Thomas never sent it to her. \n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1607411", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1607411", "title": "Republic (Plato)", "text": "Republic (Plato)\n\nThe Republic (, Politeia; Latin: Res Publica) is a Socratic dialogue, written by Plato around 380 BC, concerning justice (), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. It is Plato's best-known work, and has proven to be one of the world's most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically.\n\nIn the dialogue, Socrates discusses with various Athenians and foreigners about the meaning of justice and whether the just man is happier than the unjust man. They consider the natures of existing regimes and then propose a series of different, hypothetical cities in comparison, culminating in Kallipolis (Καλλίπολις), a city-state ruled by a philosopher king. They also discuss the theory of forms, the immortality of the soul, and the role of the philosopher and of poetry in society. The dialog's setting seems to be during the Peloponnesian War.\n\nWhile visiting the Piraeus with Glaucon, Polemarchus asks Socrates to join him for a celebration. Socrates then asks Cephalus, Polemarchus, and Thrasymachus their definitions of justice. Cephalus defines justice as giving what is owed. Polemarchus says justice is \"the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies.\" Thrasymachus proclaims \"justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger.\" Socrates overturns their definitions and says that it is to your advantage to be just and disadvantage to be unjust. The first book ends in aporia concerning its essence.\n\nSocrates believes he has answered Thrasymachus and is done with the discussion of justice.\n\nSocrates' young companions, Glaucon and Adeimantus, continue the argument of Thrasymachus for the sake of furthering the discussion. Glaucon gives a speech in which he argues first that the origin of justice was in social contracts aimed at preventing one from suffering injustice and being unable to take revenge, second that all those who practice justice do so unwillingly and out of fear of punishment, and third that the life of the unjust man is far more blessed than that of the just man. Glaucon would like Socrates to prove that justice is not only desirable, but that it belongs to the highest class of desirable things: those desired both for their own sake and their consequences.\n\nAfter Glaucon's speech, Adeimantus adds that, in this thought experiment, the unjust should not fear any sort of divine judgement in the afterlife, since the very poets who wrote about such judgement also wrote that the gods would grant forgiveness to those humans who made ample religious sacrifice. Adeimantus demonstrates his reason by drawing two detailed portraits, that the unjust man could grow wealthy by injustice, devoting a percentage of this gain to religious sacrifices, thus rendering him innocent in the eyes of the gods.\n\nSocrates suggests that they look for justice in a city rather than in an individual man. After attributing the origin of society to the individual not being self-sufficient and having many needs which he cannot supply himself, they go on to describe the development of the city. Socrates first describes the \"healthy state\", but Glaucon asks him to describe \"a city of pigs\", as he finds little difference between the two. He then goes on to describe the luxurious city, which he calls \"a fevered state\". This requires a guardian class to defend and attack on its account. This begins a discussion concerning the type of education that ought to be given to these guardians in their early years, including the topic of what kind of stories are appropriate. They conclude that stories that ascribe evil to the gods are untrue and should not be taught.\n\nSocrates and his companions Adeimantus and Glaucon conclude their discussion concerning education. Socrates breaks the educational system into two. They suggest that guardians should be educated in these four virtues: wisdom, courage, justice and temperance. They also suggest that the second part of the guardians' education should be in gymnastics. With physical training they will be able to live without needing frequent medical attention: physical training will help prevent illness and weakness. Socrates asserts that both male and female guardians be given the same education, that all wives and children be shared, and that they be prohibited from owning private property.\n\nSocrates and his companions conclude their discussion concerning the lifestyle of the guardians, thus concluding their initial assessment of the city as a whole. Socrates assumes each person will be happy engaging in the occupation that suits them best. If the city as a whole is happy, then individuals are happy. In the physical education and diet of the guardians, the emphasis is on moderation, since both poverty and excessive wealth will corrupt them (422a1). Without controlling their education, the city cannot control the future rulers. Socrates says that it is pointless to worry over specific laws, like those pertaining to contracts, since proper education ensures lawful behavior, and poor education causes lawlessness (425a-425c).\n\nSocrates proceeds to search for wisdom, courage, and temperance in the city, on the grounds that justice will be easier to discern in what remains (427e). They find wisdom among the guardian rulers, courage among the guardian warriors (or auxiliaries), temperance among all classes of the city in agreeing about who should rule and who should be ruled. Finally, Socrates defines justice in the city as the state in which each class performs only its own work, not meddling in the work of the other classes (433b). \n\nThe virtues discovered in the city are then sought in the individual soul. For this purpose, Socrates creates an analogy between the parts of the city and the soul (the city-soul analogy). He argues that psychological conflict points to a divided soul, since a completely unified soul could not behave in opposite ways towards the same object, at the same time, and in the same respect (436b). He gives examples of possible conflicts between the rational, “spirited,” and appetitive parts of the soul, corresponding to the rulers, auxiliaries, and producing classes in the city. \n\nHaving established the tripartite soul, Socrates defines the virtues of the individual. A person is wise if he is ruled by the part of the soul that knows “what is beneficial for each part and for the whole,” courageous if his spirited part “preserves in the midst of pleasures and pains” the decisions reached by the rational part, and temperate if the three parts agree that the rational part lead (442c-d). They are just if each part of the soul attends to its function and not the function of another. It follows from this definition that one cannot be just if one doesn’t have the other cardinal virtues.\n\nSocrates, having to his satisfaction defined the just constitution of both city and psyche, moves to elaborate upon the four unjust constitutions of these. Adeimantus and Polemarchus interrupt, asking Socrates instead first to explain how the sharing of wives and children in the guardian class is to be defined and legislated, a theme first touched on in Book III. Socrates is overwhelmed at their request, categorizing it as three \"waves\" of attack against which his reasoning must stand firm. These three waves challenge Socrates' claims that \n\n\nSocrates' argument is that in the ideal city, a true philosopher with understanding of forms will facilitate the harmonious co-operation of all the citizens of the city. This philosopher-king must be intelligent, reliable, and willing to lead a simple life. However, these qualities are rarely manifested on their own, and so they must be encouraged through education and the study of The Good. Just as visible objects must be illuminated in order to be seen, so must also be true of objects of knowledge if light is cast on them. Just as light comes from the Sun, so does truth come from goodness. Goodness as the source of truth makes it possible for the mind to know, just as light from the Sun makes the eyes able to see.\n\nSocrates elaborates upon the immediately preceding Analogies of the Sun and of the Divided Line in the Allegory of the Cave, in which he insists that the psyche must be freed from bondage to the visible/sensible world by making the painful journey into the intelligible world. He continues in the rest of this book by further elaborating upon the curriculum which a would-be philosopher-king must study. This is the origin of the quadrivium: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music.\n\nNext, they elaborate on the education of the philosopher king. Until age 18, would-be guardians should be engaged in basic intellectual study and physical training, followed by two years of military training. However, a correction is then introduced where the study of gymnastics (martial arts) and warfare - 3 plus 2 years, respectively - are supplanted by philosophy for 5 years instead. Next, they receive ten years of mathematics until age 30, and then five years of dialectic training. Guardians then spend the next 15 years as leaders, trying to \"lead people from the cave\". (This refers to \"the Allegory of the Cave\") Upon reaching 50, they are fully aware of the form of good, and totally mature and ready to lead.\n\nSocrates discusses four unjust constitutions: timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny. He argues that a society will decay and pass through each government in succession, eventually becoming a tyranny, the most unjust regime of all.\n\nThe starting point is an imagined, alternate aristocracy (ruled by a philosopher-king); a just government dominated by the wisdom-loving element. When its social structure breaks down and enters civil war, it is replaced by timocracy. The timocratic government is dominated by the spirited element, with a ruling class of property-owners consisting of warriors or generals (Ancient Sparta is an example). As the emphasis on honor is compromised by wealth accumulation, it is replaced by oligarchy. The oligarchic government is dominated by the desiring element, in which the rich are the ruling class. The gap between rich and poor widens, culminating in a revolt by the underclass majority, establishing a democracy. Democracy emphasizes maximum freedom, so power is distributed evenly. It is also dominated by the desiring element, but in an undisciplined, unrestrained way. The populism of the democratic government leads to mob rule, fueled by fear of oligarchy, which a clever demagogue can exploit to take power and establish tyranny. In a tyrannical government, the city is enslaved to the tyrant, who uses his guards to remove the best social elements and individuals from the city to retain power (since they pose a threat), while leaving the worst. He will also provoke warfare to consolidate his position as leader. In this way, tyranny is the most unjust regime of all.\n\nIn parallel to this, Socrates considers the individual or soul that corresponds to each of these regimes. He describes how an aristocrat may become weak or detached from political and material affluence, and how his son will respond to this by becoming overly ambitious. The timocrat in turn may be defeated by the courts or vested interests; his son responds by accumulating wealth in order to gain power in society and defend himself against the same predicament, thereby becoming an oligarch. The oligarch's son will grow up with wealth without having to practice thrift or stinginess, and will be tempted and overwhelmed by his desires, so that he becomes democratic, valuing freedom above all.\n\nHaving discussed the tyrannical constitution of a city, Socrates wishes to discuss the tyrannical constitution of a psyche. This is all intended to answer Thrasymachus' first argument in Book I, that the life of the unjust man (here understood as a true tyrant) is more blessed than that of the just man (the philosopher-king).\n\nFirst, he describes how a tyrannical man develops from a democratic household. The democratic man is torn between tyrannical passions and oligarchic discipline, and ends up in the middle ground: valuing all desires, both good and bad. The tyrant will be tempted in the same way as the democrat, but without an upbringing in discipline or moderation to restrain him. Therefore, his most base desires and wildest passions overwhelm him, and he becomes driven by lust, using force and fraud to take whatever he wants. The tyrant is both a slave to his lusts, and a master to whomever he can enslave.\n\nBecause of this, tyranny is the regime with the least freedom and happiness, and the tyrant is most unhappy of all, since the regime and soul correspond. His desires are never fulfilled, and he always must live in fear of his victims. Because the tyrant can only think in terms of servant and master, he has no equals whom he can befriend, and with no friends the tyrant is robbed of freedom. This is the first proof that it is better to be just than unjust. The second proof is derived from the tripartite theory of soul. The wisdom-loving soul is best equipped to judge what is best through reason, and the wise individual judges wisdom to be best, then honor, then desire. This is the just proportion for the city or soul and stands opposite to tyranny, which is entirely satiated on base desires. The third proof follows from this. He describes how the soul can be misled into experiencing false pleasure: for example, a lack of pain can seem pleasurable by comparison to a worse state. True pleasure is had by being fulfilled by things that fit one's nature. Wisdom is the most fulfilling and is the best guide, so the only way for the three drives of the soul to function properly and experience the truest pleasure is by allowing wisdom to lead. To conclude the third proof, the wisdom element is best at providing pleasure, while tyranny is worst because it is furthest removed from wisdom.\n\nFinally, Socrates considers the multiple of how much worse tyranny is than the kingly/disciplined/wise temperament, and even quantifies the tyrant as living 729 times more painfully/less joyfully than the king. He then gives the example of a chimera to further illustrate justice and the tripartite soul.\n\nThe discussion concludes by refuting Thrasymachus' argument and designating the most blessed life as that of the just man and the most miserable life as that of the unjust man.\n\nConcluding a theme brought up most explicitly in the Analogies of the Sun and Divided Line in Book VI, Socrates finally rejects any form of imitative art and concludes that such artists have no place in the just city. He continues on to argue for the immortality of the psyche and even espouses a theory of reincarnation. He finishes by detailing the rewards of being just, both in this life and the next. Artists create things but they are only different copies of the idea of the original. \n\"And whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts, and all things else that anybody knows, and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man—whoever tells us this, I think that we can only imagine to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met, and whom he thought all-knowing, because he himself was unable to analyze the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation.\"\n\n\"And the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water, and crooked when in the water; and the concave becomes convex, owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable. Thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us; and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenous devices imposes, having an effect upon us like magic.\"\n\nHe speaks about illusions and confusion. Things can look very similar, but be different in reality. Because we are human, at times we cannot tell the difference between the two.\n\n\"And does not the same hold also of the ridiculous? There are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself, and yet on the comic stage, or indeed in private, when you hear them, you are greatly amused by them, and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness—the case of pity is repeated—there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh, and this which you once restrained by reason, because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon, is now let out again; and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre, you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home.\"\n\nWith all of us, we may approve of something, as long we are not directly involved with it. If we joke about it, we are supporting it.\n\n\"Quite true, he said. \nAnd the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections, of desire and pain and pleasure, which are held to be inseparable from every action—in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up; she lets them rule, although they ought to be controlled, if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue.\"\n\nSometimes we let our passions rule our actions or way of thinking, although they should be controlled, so that we can increase our happiness.\n\nThree interpretations of the \"Republic\" are presented in the following section; they are not exhaustive in their treatments of the work, but are examples of contemporary interpretation.\n\nIn his \"A History of Western Philosophy\" (1945), Bertrand Russell identifies three parts to the \"Republic\":\n\nThe core of the second part is the Allegory of the Cave and the discussion of the theory of ideal forms. The third part concerns the Five Regimes and is strongly related to the later dialogue \"The Laws\"; and the Myth of Er.\n\nFrancis Cornford, , and Eric Voegelin contributed to an establishment of sub-divisions marked with special formulae in Greek:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe paradigm of the city—the idea of the Good, the \"Agathon\"—has manifold historical embodiments, undertaken by those who have seen the Agathon, and are ordered via the vision. The centerpiece of the \"Republic\", Part II, nos. 2–3, discusses the rule of the philosopher, and the vision of the Agathon with the allegory of the cave, which is clarified in the theory of forms. The centerpiece is preceded and followed by the discussion of the means that will secure a well-ordered \"polis\" (City). Part II, no. 1, concerns marriage, the community of people and goods for the guardians, and the restraints on warfare among the Hellenes. It describes a partially communistic \"polis\". Part II, no. 4, deals with the philosophical education of the rulers who will preserve the order and character of the city-state.\n\nIn part II, the \"Embodiment of the Idea\", is preceded by the establishment of the economic and social orders of a \"polis\" (part I), followed by an analysis (part III) of the decline the order must traverse. The three parts compose the main body of the dialogues, with their discussions of the \"paradigm\", its embodiment, its genesis, and its decline.\n\nThe introduction and the conclusion are the frame for the body of the \"Republic\". The discussion of right order is occasioned by the questions: \"Is justice better than injustice?\" and \"Will an unjust man fare better than a just man?\" The introductory question is balanced by the concluding answer: \"Justice is preferable to injustice\". In turn, the foregoing are framed with the \"Prologue\" (Book I) and the \"Epilogue\" (Book X). The prologue is a short dialogue about the common public \"doxai\" (opinions) about justice. Based upon faith, and not reason, the \"Epilogue\" describes the new arts and the immortality of the soul.\n\nLeo Strauss identified a four-part structure to the \"Republic\", perceiving the dialogues as a drama enacted by particular characters, each with a particular perspective and level of intellect:\n\nIn the first book, two definitions of justice are proposed but deemed inadequate. Returning debts owed, and helping friends while harming enemies, are commonsense definitions of justice that, Socrates shows, are inadequate in exceptional situations, and thus lack the rigidity demanded of a definition. Yet he does not completely reject them, for each expresses a commonsense notion of justice that Socrates will incorporate into his discussion of the just regime in books II through V.\n\nAt the end of Book I, Socrates agrees with Polemarchus that justice includes helping friends, but says the just man would never do harm to anybody. Thrasymachus believes that Socrates has done the men present an injustice by saying this and attacks his character and reputation in front of the group, partly because he suspects that Socrates himself does not even believe harming enemies is unjust. Thrasymachus gives his understanding of justice and injustice as \"justice is what is advantageous to the stronger, while injustice is to one's own profit and advantage\". Socrates finds this definition unclear and begins to question Thrasymachus. Socrates then asks whether the ruler who makes a mistake by making a law that lessens their well-being, is still a ruler according to that definition. Thrasymachus agrees that no true ruler would make such an error. This agreement allows Socrates to undermine Thrasymachus' strict definition of justice by comparing rulers to people of various professions. Thrasymachus consents to Socrates' assertion that an artist is someone who does his job well, and is a knower of some art, which allows him to complete the job well. In so doing Socrates gets Thrasymachus to admit that rulers who enact a law that does not benefit them firstly, are in the precise sense \"not\" rulers. Thrasymachus gives up, and is silent from then on. Socrates has trapped Thrasymachus into admitting the strong man who makes a mistake is not the strong man in the precise sense, and that some type of knowledge is required to rule perfectly. However, it is far from a satisfactory definition of justice.\n\nAt the beginning of Book II, Plato's two brothers challenge Socrates to define justice in the man, and unlike the rather short and simple definitions offered in Book I, their views of justice are presented in two independent speeches. Glaucon's speech reprises Thrasymachus' idea of justice; it starts with the legend of Gyges, who discovered a ring that gave him the power to become invisible. Glaucon uses this story to argue that no man would be just if he had the opportunity of doing injustice with impunity. With the power to become invisible, Gyges is able to seduce the queen, murder the king, and take over the kingdom. Glaucon argues that the just as well as the unjust man would do the same if they had the power to get away with injustice exempt from punishment. The only reason that men are just and praise justice is out of fear of being punished for injustice. The law is a product of compromise between individuals who agree not to do injustice to others if others will not do injustice to them. Glaucon says that if people had the power to do injustice without fear of punishment, they would not enter into such an agreement. Glaucon uses this argument to challenge Socrates to defend the position that the unjust life is better than the just life. Adeimantus adds to Glaucon's speech the charge that men are only just for the results that justice brings one fortune, honor, reputation. Adeimantus challenges Socrates to prove that being just is worth something in and of itself, not only as a means to an end.\n\nSocrates says that there is no better topic to debate. In response to the two views of injustice and justice presented by Glaucon and Adeimantus, he claims incompetence, but feels it would be impious to leave justice in such doubt. Thus the \"Republic\" sets out to define justice. Given the difficulty of this task as proven in Book I, Socrates in Book II leads his interlocutors into a discussion of justice in the city, which Socrates suggests may help them see justice not only in the person, but on a larger scale, \"first in cities searching for what it is; then thusly we could examine also in some individual, examining the likeness of the bigger in the idea of the littler\" (368e–369a).\n\nFor over two and a half millennia, scholars have differed on the aptness of the city-soul analogy Socrates uses to find justice in Books II through V. The \"Republic\" is a dramatic dialogue, not a treatise. Socrates' definition of justice is never unconditionally stated, only versions of justice within each city are \"found\" and evaluated in Books II through Book V. Socrates constantly refers the definition of justice back to the conditions of the city for which it is created. He builds a series of myths, or noble lies, to make the cities appear just, and these conditions moderate life within the communities. The \"earth born\" myth makes all men believe that they are born from the earth and have predestined natures within their veins. Accordingly, Socrates defines justice as \"working at that which he is naturally best suited\", and \"to do one's own business and not to be a busybody\" (433a–433b) and goes on to say that justice sustains and perfects the other three cardinal virtues: Temperance, Wisdom, and Courage, and that justice is the cause and condition of their existence. Socrates does not include justice as a virtue within the city, suggesting that justice does not exist within the human soul either, rather it is the result of a \"well ordered\" soul. A result of this conception of justice separates people into three types; that of the soldier, that of the producer, and that of a ruler. If a ruler can create just laws, and if the warriors can carry out the orders of the rulers, and if the producers can obey this authority, then a society will be just.\n\nThe city is challenged by Adeimantus and Glaucon throughout its development: Adeimantus cannot find happiness in the city, and Glaucon cannot find honor and glory. This hypothetical city contains no private property, no marriage, or nuclear families. These are sacrificed for the common good and doing what is best fitting to one's nature. In Book V Socrates addresses the question of \"natural-ness\" of and possibility for this city, concluding in Book VI, that the city's ontological status regards a construction of the soul, not of an actual metropolis.\n\nThe rule of philosopher-kings appear as the issue of possibility is raised. Socrates never positively states what justice is in the human soul/city; it appears he has created a city where justice is not found, but can be lost. It is as though in a well-ordered state, justice is not even needed, since the community satisfies the needs of humans.\n\nIn terms of why it is best to be just rather than unjust for the individual, Plato prepares an answer in Book IX consisting of three main arguments. Plato says that a tyrant's nature will leave him with \"horrid pains and pangs\" and that the typical tyrant engages in a lifestyle that will be physically and mentally exacting on such a ruler. Such a disposition is in contrast to the truth-loving philosopher king, and a tyrant \"never tastes of true freedom or friendship\". The second argument proposes that of all the different types of people, only the philosopher is able to judge which type of ruler is best since only he can see the Form of the Good. Thirdly, Plato argues, \"Pleasures which are approved of by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest.\" In sum, Plato argues that philosophical pleasure is the only true pleasure since other pleasures experienced by others are simply a neutral state free of pain.\n\nSocrates points out the human tendency to be corrupted by power leads down the road to timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny. From this, he concludes that ruling should be left to philosophers, who are the most just and therefore least susceptible to corruption. This \"good city\" is depicted as being governed by philosopher-kings; disinterested persons who rule not for their personal enjoyment but for the good of the city-state (polis). The paradigmatic society which stands behind every historical society is hierarchical, but social classes have a marginal permeability; there are no slaves, no discrimination between men and women. The men and women are both to be taught the same things, so they are both able to be used for the same things (451e). In addition to the ruling class of guardians (φύλακες), which abolished riches, there is a class of private producers (demiourgoi), who may be rich or poor. A number of provisions aim to avoid making the people weak: the substitution of a universal educational system for men and women instead of debilitating music, poetry and theatre—a startling departure from Greek society. These provisions apply to all classes, and the restrictions placed on the philosopher-kings chosen from the warrior class and the warriors are much more severe than those placed on the producers, because the rulers must be kept away from any source of corruption.\n\nIn Books V-VI the abolition of riches among the guardian class (not unlike Max Weber's bureaucracy) leads controversially to the abandonment of the typical family, and as such no child may know his or her parents and the parents may not know their own children. Socrates tells a tale which is the \"allegory of the good government\". The rulers assemble couples for reproduction, based on breeding criteria. Thus, stable population is achieved through eugenics and social cohesion is projected to be high because familial links are extended towards everyone in the city. Also the education of the youth is such that they are taught of only works of writing that encourage them to improve themselves for the state's good, and envision (the) god(s) as entirely good, just, and the author(s) of only that which is good.\n\nIn Books VII-X stand Plato's criticism of the forms of government. It begins with the dismissal of timocracy, a sort of authoritarian regime, not unlike a military dictatorship. Plato offers an almost psychoanalytical explanation of the \"timocrat\" as one who saw his father humiliated by his mother and wants to vindicate \"manliness\". The third worst regime is oligarchy, the rule of a small band of rich people, millionaires that only respect money. Then comes the democratic form of government, and its susceptibility to being ruled by unfit \"sectarian\" demagogues. Finally the worst regime is tyranny, where the whimsical desires of the ruler became law and there is no check upon arbitrariness.\n\nThe \"Republic\" contains Plato's \"Allegory of the cave\" with which he explains his concept of The Forms as an answer to the problem of universals.\n\nThe allegory of the cave primarily depicts Plato's distinction between the world of appearances and the 'real' world of the Forms, as well as helping to justify the philosopher's place in society as king. Plato imagines a group of people who have lived their entire lives as prisoners, chained to the wall of a cave in the subterranean so they are unable to see the outside world behind them. However a constant flame illuminates various moving objects outside, which are silhouetted on the wall of the cave visible to the prisoners. These prisoners, through having no other experience of reality, ascribe forms to these shadows such as either \"dog\" or \"cat\".\n\nPlato then goes on to explain how the philosopher is akin to a prisoner who is freed from the cave. The prisoner is initially blinded by the light, but when he adjusts to the brightness he sees the fire and the statues and how they caused the images witnessed inside the cave. He sees that the fire and statues in the cave were just copies of the real objects; merely imitations. This is analogous to the Forms. What we see from day to day are merely appearances, reflections of the Forms. The philosopher, however, will not be deceived by the shadows and will hence be able to see the 'real' world, the world above that of appearances; the philosopher will gain knowledge of things in themselves. In this analogy the sun is representative of the Good. This is the main object of the philosopher's knowledge. The Good can be thought of as the form of Forms, or the structuring of the world as a whole.\n\nThe prisoner's stages of understanding correlate with the levels on the divided line which he imagines. The line is divided into what the visible world is and what the intelligible world is, with the divider being the Sun. When the prisoner is in the cave, he is obviously in the visible realm that receives no sunlight, and outside he comes to be in the intelligible realm.\n\nThe shadows witnessed in the cave correspond to the lowest level on Plato's line, that of imagination and conjecture. Once the prisoner is freed and sees the shadows for what they are he reaches the second stage on the divided line, the stage of belief, for he comes to believe that the statues in the cave are real. On leaving the cave, however, the prisoner comes to see objects more real than the statues inside of the cave, and this correlates with the third stage on Plato's line, thought. Lastly, the prisoner turns to the sun which he grasps as the source of truth, or the Form of the Good, and this last stage, named as dialectic, is the highest possible stage on the line. The prisoner, as a result of the Form of the Good, can begin to understand all other forms in reality.\n\nAt the end of this allegory, Plato asserts that it is the philosopher's burden to reenter the cave. Those who have seen the ideal world, he says, have the duty to educate those in the material world. Since the philosopher recognizes what is truly good only he is fit to rule society according to Plato.\n\nWhile Plato spends much of the \"Republic\" having Socrates narrate a conversation about the city he founds with Glaucon and Adeimantus \"in speech\", the discussion eventually turns to considering four regimes that exist in reality and tend to degrade successively into each other: timocracy, oligarchy (also called plutocracy), democracy and tyranny (also called despotism).\n\nTimocracy\n\nSocrates defines a timocracy as a government of people who love rule and honor. Socrates argues that the timocracy emerges from aristocracy due to a civil war breaking out among the ruling class and the majority. Over time, many more births will occur to people who lack aristocratic, guardian qualities, slowly drawing the populace away from knowledge, music, poetry and \"guardian education\", toward money-making and the acquisition of possessions. This civil war between those who value wisdom and those who value material acquisition will continue until a compromise is reached. The timocracy values war insofar as it satisfies a love of victory and honor. The timocratic man loves physical training, and hunting, and values his abilities in warfare.\n\nOligarchy\n\nTemptations create a confusion between economic status and honor which is responsible for the emergence of oligarchy. In Book VIII, Socrates suggests that wealth will not help a pilot to navigate his ship, as his concerns will be directed centrally toward increasing his wealth by whatever means, rather than seeking out wisdom or honor. The injustice of economic disparity divides the rich and the poor, thus creating an environment for criminals and beggars to emerge. The rich are constantly plotting against the poor and vice versa. The oligarchic constitution is based on property assessment and wealth qualification. Unlike the timocracy, oligarchs are also unable to fight war, since they do not wish to arm the majority for fear of their rising up against them (fearing the majority even more than their enemies), nor do they seem to pay mercenaries, since they are reluctant to spend money.\n\nDemocracy\n\nAs this socioeconomic divide grows, so do tensions between social classes. From the conflicts arising out of such tensions, the poor majority overthrow the wealthy minority, and democracy replaces the oligarchy preceding it. The poor overthrow the oligarchs and grant liberties and freedoms to citizens, creating a most variegated collection of peoples under a \"supermarket\" of constitutions. A visually appealing demagogue is soon lifted up to protect the interests of the lower class. However, with too much freedom, no requirements for anyone to rule, and having no interest in assessing the background of their rulers (other than honoring such people because they wish the majority well) the people become easily persuaded by such a demagogue's appeal to try and satisfy people's common, base, and unnecessary pleasures.\n\nTyranny\n\nThe excessive freedoms granted to the citizens of a democracy ultimately leads to a tyranny, the furthest regressed type of government. These freedoms divide the people into three socioeconomic classes: the dominating class, the elites and the commoners. Tensions between the dominating class and the elites cause the commoners to seek out protection of their democratic liberties. They invest all their power in their democratic demagogue, who, in turn, becomes corrupted by the power and becomes a tyrant with a small entourage of his supporters for protection and absolute control of his people.\n\nThe idea of writing treatises on systems of government was followed some decades later by Plato's most prominent pupil Aristotle, whose \"Politika\" systematises many of Plato's concepts, in some cases differing from his conclusions.\n\nIt has been suggested that Isocrates parodies the \"Republic\" in his work \"Busiris\" by showing Callipolis' similarity to the Egyptian state founded by a king of that name.\n\nZeno of Citium, the founder of Stoicism, wrote his own imitation of Plato's \"Republic\", c. 300 BC. \"Zeno's Republic\" advocates a form of anarchism in which all of the citizens are philosophers, and advocates a more radical form of sexual communism than that proposed by Plato.\n\nThe English title of Plato's dialogue is derived from Cicero's \"De re publica\", written some three centuries later. Cicero's dialogue imitates Plato's style and treats many of the same topics, and Cicero's main character Scipio Africanus expresses his esteem for Plato and Socrates.\n\n\"Res publica\" is not an exact translation of Plato's Greek title \"politeia\". Rather, \"politeia\" is a general term for the actual and potential forms of government for a \"Polis\" or city-state, and Plato attempts to survey all possible forms of the state. Cicero's discussion is more parochial, focusing on the improvement of the participants' own state, the Roman Republic in its final stages.\n\nIn antiquity, Plato's works were largely acclaimed, but a few commentators regarded them as too theoretical. Tacitus, commented on such works as \"The Republic\" and Aristotle's \"Politics\" in his \"Ann.\" (IV, 33):\n\nIn this work, Tacitus undertakes the prosaic description and minute analysis of how real states are governed, attempting to derive more practical lessons about good versus bad governance than can be deduced from speculations on ideal governments.\n\nIn the pivotal era of Rome's move from its ancient polytheist religion to Christianity, Augustine wrote his magnum opus \"The City of God\": Again, the references to Plato, Aristotle and Cicero and their visions of the ideal state were legion: Augustine equally described a model of the \"ideal city\", in his case the eternal Jerusalem, using a visionary language not unlike that of the preceding philosophers.\n\nIslamic philosophers were much more interested in Aristotle than Plato, but not having access to Aristotle's \"Politics\", Ibn Rushd (Averroes) produced instead a commentary on\nPlato's \"Republic\". He advances an authoritarian ideal, following Plato's paternalistic model. Absolute monarchy, led by a philosopher-king, creates a justly ordered society. This requires extensive use of coercion, although persuasion is preferred and is possible if the young are properly raised. Rhetoric, not logic, is the appropriate road to truth for the common man. Demonstrative knowledge via philosophy and logic requires special study. Rhetoric aids religion in reaching the masses.\n\nFollowing Plato, Ibn Rushd accepts the principle of women's equality. They should be educated and allowed to serve in the military; the best among them might be tomorrow's philosophers or rulers. He also accepts Plato's illiberal measures such as the censorship of literature. He uses examples from Arab history to illustrate just and degenerate political orders.\n\nHegel respected Plato's theories of state and ethics much more than those of the early modern philosophers such as Locke, Hobbes and Rousseau, whose theories proceeded from a fictional \"state of nature\" defined by humanity's \"natural\" needs, desires and freedom. For Hegel this was a contradiction: since nature and the individual are contradictory, the freedoms which define individuality as such are latecomers on the stage of history. Therefore, these philosophers unwittingly projected man as an individual in modern society onto a primordial state of nature. Plato however had managed to grasp the ideas specific to his time:\n\nFor Hegel, Plato's Republic is not an abstract theory or ideal which is too good for the real nature of man, but rather is not ideal enough, not good enough for the ideals already inherent or nascent in the reality of his time; a time when Greece was entering decline. One such nascent idea was about to crush the Greek way of life: modern freedoms—or Christian freedoms in Hegel's view—such as the individual's choice of his social class, or of what property to pursue, or which career to follow. Such individual freedoms were excluded from Plato's Republic:\n\nGreece being at a crossroads, Plato's new \"constitution\" in the \"Republic\" was an attempt to preserve Greece: it was a reactionary reply to the new freedoms of private property etc., that were eventually given legal form through Rome. Accordingly, in ethical life, it was an attempt to introduce a religion that elevated each individual not as an owner of property, but as the possessor of an immortal soul.\n\nIn his 1934 \"Plato und die Dichter\" (\"Plato and the Poets\"), as well as several other works, Hans-Georg Gadamer describes the utopic city of the \"Republic\" as a heuristic utopia that should not be pursued or even be used as an orientation-point for political development. Rather, its purpose is said to be to show how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another—often with highly problematic results—if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously. This interpretation argues that large passages in Plato's writing are ironic, a line of thought initially pursued by Kierkegaard.\n\nThe city portrayed in the \"Republic\" struck some critics as harsh, rigid, and unfree; indeed, as totalitarian. Karl Popper gave a voice to that view in his 1945 book \"The Open Society and Its Enemies\", where he singled out Plato's state as a dystopia. Popper divorced Plato's ideas from those of Socrates, claiming that the former in his later years expressed none of the humanitarian and democratic tendencies of his teacher. In particular, Popper accuses Plato of betraying Socrates. Gilbert Ryle, reviewing Popper's text just two years after its publication and agreeing with him, wrote that Plato \"was Socrates' Judas.\" Popper thought Plato's envisioned state totalitarian as it advocated a government composed only of a distinct hereditary ruling class, with the working class—who Popper argues Plato regards as \"human cattle\"—given no role in decision making. He argues that Plato has no interest in what are commonly regarded as the problems of justice—the resolving of disputes between individuals—because Plato has redefined justice as \"keeping one's place\".\n\nEric Voegelin in \"Plato and Aristotle\" (Baton Rouge, 1957), gave meaning to the concept of 'Just City in Speech' (Books II-V). For instance, there is evidence in the dialogue that Socrates himself would not be a member of his 'ideal' state. His life was almost solely dedicated to the private pursuit of knowledge. More practically, Socrates suggests that members of the lower classes could rise to the higher ruling class, and vice versa, if they had 'gold' in their veins—a version of the concept of social mobility. The exercise of power is built on the 'noble lie' that all men are brothers, born of the earth, yet there is a clear hierarchy and class divisions. There is a tripartite explanation of human psychology that is extrapolated to the city, the relation among peoples. There is no family among the guardians, another crude version of Max Weber's concept of bureaucracy as the state non-private concern. Together with Leo Strauss, Voegelin considered Popper's interpretation to be a gross misunderstanding not only of the dialogue itself, but of the very nature and character of Plato's entire philosophic enterprise.\n\nSome of Plato's proposals have led theorists like Leo Strauss and Allan Bloom to ask readers to consider the possibility that Socrates was creating not a blueprint for a real city, but a learning exercise for the young men in the dialogue. There are many points in the construction of the \"Just City in Speech\" that seem contradictory, which raise the possibility Socrates is employing irony to make the men in the dialogue question for themselves the ultimate value of the proposals. In turn, Plato has immortalized this 'learning exercise' in the \"Republic\".\n\nOne of many examples is that Socrates calls the marriages of the ruling class 'sacred'; however, they last only one night and are the result of manipulating and drugging couples into predetermined intercourse with the aim of eugenically breeding guardian-warriors. Strauss and Bloom's interpretations, however, involve more than just pointing out inconsistencies; by calling attention to these issues they ask readers to think more deeply about whether Plato is being ironic or genuine, for neither Strauss nor Bloom present an unequivocal opinion, preferring to raise philosophic doubt over interpretive fact.\n\nLeo Strauss's approach developed out of a belief that Plato wrote esoterically. The basic acceptance of the exoteric-esoteric distinction revolves around whether Plato really wanted to see the \"Just City in Speech\" of Books V-VI come to pass, or whether it is just an allegory. Strauss never regarded this as the crucial issue of the dialogue. He argued against Karl Popper's literal view, citing Cicero's opinion that the \"Republic's\" true nature was to bring to light the nature of political things. In fact, Strauss undermines the justice found in the \"Just City in Speech\" by implying the city is not natural, it is a man-made conceit that abstracts away from the erotic needs of the body. The city founded in the \"Republic\" \"is rendered possible by the abstraction from eros\".\n\nAn argument that has been used against ascribing ironic intent to Plato is that Plato's Academy produced a number of tyrants who seized political power and abandoned philosophy for ruling a city. Despite being well-versed in Greek and having direct contact with Plato himself, some of Plato's former students like Clearchus, tyrant of Heraclea; Chaeron, tyrant of Pellene; Erastus and Coriscus, tyrants of Skepsis; Hermias of Atarneus and Assos; and Calippus, tyrant of Syracuse ruled people and did not impose anything like a philosopher-kingship. However, it can be argued whether these men became \"tyrants\" through studying in the Academy. Plato's school had an elite student body, some of whom would by birth, and family expectation, end up in the seats of power. Additionally, it is important to remember that it is by no means obvious that these men were tyrants in the modern, totalitarian sense of the concept. Finally, since very little is actually known about what was taught at Plato's Academy, there is no small controversy over whether it was even in the business of teaching politics at all.\n\nMany critics, both ancient and modern (like Julia Annas), have suggested that the dialogue's political discussion actually serves as an analogy for the individual soul, in which there are also many different \"members\" that can either conflict or else be integrated and orchestrated under a just and productive \"government.\" Among other things, this analogical reading would solve the problem of certain implausible statements Plato makes concerning an ideal political republic. In a definitive treatment of the subject, Blössner (2007) presents and argues for the case that the \"Republic\" is best understood as an analysis of the workings and moral improvement of the individual soul with remarkable thoroughness and clarity. This view, of course, does not preclude a legitimate reading of the \"Republic\" as a political treatise (the work could operate at both levels). It merely implies that it deserves more attention as a work on psychology and moral philosophy than it has sometimes received.\n\nThe above-mentioned views have in common that they view the \"Republic\" as a theoretical work, not as a set of guidelines for good governance. However, Popper insists that the Republic, \"was meant by its author not so much as a theoretical treatise, but as a topical political manifesto\" and Bertrand Russell argues that at least in \"intent\", and all in all not so far from what was possible in ancient Greek city-states, the form of government portrayed in the \"Republic\" was meant as a practical one by Plato.\n\nOne of Plato's recurring techniques in the \"Republic\" is to refine the concept of justice with reference to various examples of greater or lesser injustice. However, in \"The Concept of Injustice\", Eric Heinze challenges the assumption that 'justice' and 'injustice' form a mutually exclusive pair. Heinze argues that such an assumption traces not from strict deductive logic, but from the arbitrary etymology of the word 'injustice'. Heinze critiques what he calls 'classical' Western justice theory for having perpetuated that logical error, which first appears in Plato's \"Republic\", but manifests throughout traditional political philosophy, in thinkers otherwise as different as Aristotle, Aquinas, Locke, Rousseau, Hegel and Marx.\n\nIn 2001, a survey of over 1,000 academics and students voted the \"Republic\" the greatest philosophical text ever written. Julian Baggini argued that although the work \"was wrong on almost every point, the questions it raises and the methods it uses are essential to the western tradition of philosophy. Without it we might not have philosophy as we know it.\"\n\nIn fiction, Jo Walton's 2015 novel \"The Just City\" explored the consequences of establishing a city-state based on the \"Republic\" in practice.\n\nThe \"Republic\" is generally placed in the \"middle period\" of Plato's dialogues—that is, it is believed to be written after the \"early period\" dialogues but before the \"late period\" dialogues. However, the distinction of this group from the early dialogues is not as clear as the distinction of the late dialogues from all the others. Nonetheless, Ritter, Arnim, and Baron—with their separate methodologies—all agreed that the \"Republic\" was well distinguished, along with \"Parmenides\", \"Phaedrus\" and \"Theaetetus\".\n\nHowever, the first book of the \"Republic\", which shares many features with earlier dialogues, is thought to have originally been written as a separate work, and then the remaining books were conjoined to it, perhaps with modifications to the original of the first book.\n\nSeveral Oxyrhynchus Papyri fragments were found to contain parts of the Republic, and from other works such as Phaedo, or the dialogue Gorgias, written around 200-300 CE. Fragments of a different version of Plato's Republic were discovered in 1945, part of the Nag Hammadi library, written ca. 350 CE. These findings highlight the influence of Plato during those times in Egypt.\n\n\n\n"}

The inverse of resistance is sensitivity.\n\nResistance is one of the major aspects of ecological stability. Volker Grimm and Christian Wissel identified 70 terms and 163 distinct definitions of the various aspects of ecological stability, but found that they could be reduced to three fundamental properties: \"staying essentially unchanged\", \"returning to the reference state...after a temporary disturbance\" and \"persistence through time of an ecological system\". Resistant communities are able to remain \"essentially unchanged\" despite disturbance. Although commonly seen as distinct from resilience, Brian Walker and colleagues considered resistance to be a component of resilience in their expanded definition of resilience, while Fridolin Brand used a definition of resilience that he described as \"close to the stability concept 'resistance', as identified by Grimm and Wissel (1997)\". The inverse of resistance is sensitivity - sensitive species or communities show large changes when subject to environmental stress or disturbance.\n\nIn 1988, Hurricane Joan hit the rainforests along Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. Douglas Boucher and colleagues contrasted the resistant response of \"Qualea paraensis\" with the resilient response of \"Vochysia ferruginea\"; the mortality rate was low for \"Q. paraensis\" (despite extensive damage to the trees), but the growth rates of surviving trees were also low and few seedlings established. Despite the disturbance, populations were essentially unchanged. In contrast, \"V. ferruginea\" experienced very high rates of mortality in the hurricane but showed very high rates of seedling recruitment. As a result, population densities of the species increased. In their study of Jamaican montane forests affected by Hurricane Hugo in 1988, Peter Bellingham and colleagues used the degree of hurricane damage and the magnitude of the post-hurricane response to categorise tree species into four groups – resistant species (those with limited storm damage and low response), susceptible species (greater damage but low response), usurpers (limited damage but high response) and resilient species (greater damage and high response).\n\nEnglish ecologist Charles Elton applied the term resistance to the ecosystem properties which limit the ability of introduced species to successfully invade communities. These properties include both abiotic factors like temperature and drought, and biotic factors including competition, predation and the lack of necessary mutualists. Higher species diversity and lower resource availability can also contribute to resistance.\n"}

In its first form, from 1840 to 1844, it served as the chief publication of the Transcendentalists. From the 1880s to 1919 it was revived as a political review and literary criticism magazine. From 1920 to 1929 it was an influential outlet for modernist literature in English.\n\nMembers of the Hedge Club began talks for creating a vehicle for their essays and reviews in philosophy and religion in October 1839. Other influential journals, including the \"North American Review\" and the \"Christian Examiner\" refused to accept their work for publication. Orestes Brownson proposed utilizing his recently established periodical \"Boston Quarterly Review\" but members of the club decided a new publication was a better solution. Frederick Henry Hedge, Theodore Parker, and Ralph Waldo Emerson were originally considered for the editor role. On October 20, 1839, Margaret Fuller officially accepted the editorship, though she was unable to begin work on the publication until the first week of 1840. George Ripley served as the managing editor. Its first issue was published in July 1840 with an introduction by Emerson calling it a \"Journal in a new spirit\". In this first form, the magazine remained in publication until 1844. Emerson wrote to Fuller on August 4, 1840, of his ambitions for the magazine:\n\nThe title of the journal, which was suggested by Amos Bronson Alcott, intended to evoke a sundial. The connotations of the image were expanded upon by Emerson in concluding his editorial introduction to the journal's first issue:\n\n\"The Dial\" was heavily criticized, even by Transcendentalists. Ripley said, \"They had expected hoofs and horns while it proved as gentle as any sucking dove\". The journal was never financially stable. In 1843, Elizabeth Peabody, acting as business manager, noted that the journal's income was not covering the cost of printing and that subscriptions totaled just over two hundred. It ceased publication in April 1844. Horace Greeley, in the May 25 issue of the \"New-York Weekly Tribune\", reported it as an end to the \"most original and thoughtful periodical ever published in this country\".\n\nAfter a one-year revival in 1860, the third incarnation of \"The Dial\", this time as a journal of both politics and literary criticism, began publication in 1880. This version of the magazine was founded by Francis Fisher Browne in Chicago. Browne claimed it to be a legitimate offspring of Emerson and Fuller's \"Dial\". Brown would serve as its editor for over three decades. He envisioned his new literary journal in the genteel tradition of its predecessor, containing book reviews, articles about current trends in the sciences and humanities, and politics, as well as long lists of current book titles. It was in this form that Margaret Anderson, soon to be founder of \"The Little Review\", worked for the magazine. Although Chicago was a city reputedly indifferent to literary pursuits, \"The Dial\" attained national prominence, absorbing \"The Chap-Book\" in 1898.\n\nFrancis Browne died in 1913 after elevating the magazine by its unswerving standard in design and content. Control of the magazine shifted to his siblings, and under their control, the magazine lost prominence because they lacked the editing and managing abilities of Francis. In 1916, rather than continuing the failing magazine, the Browne family sold \"The Dial\" to Martyn Johnson, who \"set the magazine on a liberal, even increasingly radical course in politics and the arts as well as in literature.\" Although \"The Dial\" was, at the time, a reputable magazine with a noted Midwestern influence, Johnson decided to move to New York in 1918 to distance the magazine from the Midwest and reconnect with the city because many of the magazine's new editors had connections there. Johnson's \"Dial\" soon encountered financial problems, but future editor Scofield Thayer, heir to a New England wool fortune, invested in the magazine. During this time, Thayer met Randolph Bourne, a contributing editor to \"The Dial.\" Bourne's steadfast pacifism and aesthetic views of art inspired Thayer who reflected these philosophies in his life. After contributing to \"The Dial\" and sinking large sums of money into the company, Thayer hoped for some editorial control of the magazine. Johnson, however, would not yield any responsibilities, causing Thayer to leave the magazine in 1918.\n\nDuring the latter stages of World War I, Bourne's followers at \"The Dial\" became opponents of John Dewey who advocated absolute violence as the sole means of ending the war. This, coupled with increasing financial problems, nearly ended the magazine. These internal conflicts over ideology and finances caused Johnson to put the magazine up for sale in 1919. Thayer had teamed with a friend from Harvard, James Sibley Watson, Jr., to buy \"The Dial\" late in 1919. Watson, being an heir to the Western Union fortune, had ample money to buy the magazine with Thayer.\n\nIn 1920, Scofield Thayer and Dr. James Sibley Watson. Jr. re-established \"The Dial\" as a literary magazine, the form for which it was most successful and best known. Under Watson's and Thayer's sway \"The Dial\" published remarkably influential artwork, poetry and fiction, including William Butler Yeats' \"The Second Coming\" and the first United States publication of T. S. Eliot's \"The Waste Land\". \"The Waste Land\", however, barely made it to the pages of \"The Dial\". Ezra Pound, the magazine's foreign advisor/editor (1920–1923), suggested the poem for publication. Thayer, having never seen the work, approved it for the magazine based on this suggestion and because Eliot had been Thayer's classmate at Oxford. Eliot became frustrated, however, at the small amount \"The Dial\" intended to pay for the poem. Thayer was relieved that Eliot was about to pull the deal off the table because he was weary of Eliot's style. Negotiations continued, however, until \"The Dial\" paid Eliot $2130 for the poem, by also awarding the magazine's second annual prize, which carried an award of $2,000 (£450). This was a substantial amount, approximately equal to Eliot's 1922 salary at Lloyds Bank (£500, $2,215), and worth about $90,000 in 2006 dollars.\n\nThe first year of the Watson/Thayer \"Dial\" alone saw the appearance of Sherwood Anderson, Djuna Barnes, Kenneth Burke, William Carlos Williams, Hart Crane, E. E. Cummings, Charles Demuth, Kahlil Gibran, Gaston Lachaise, Amy Lowell, Marianne Moore, Ezra Pound, Arthur Wilson later known as Winslow Wilson, Odilon Redon, Bertrand Russell, Carl Sandburg, Van Wyck Brooks, and W. B. Yeats.\n\n\"The Dial\" published art as well as poetry and essays, with artists ranging from Vincent van Gogh, Renoir, Henri Matisse, and Odilon Redon, through Oskar Kokoschka, Constantin Brâncuși, and Edvard Munch, and Georgia O'Keeffe and Joseph Stella. The magazine also reported on the cultural life of European capitals, writers included T. S. Eliot from London, John Eglinton initially from Dublin, but after 1922 reporting on Dublin from a self-imposed exile in England, Ezra Pound from Paris, Thomas Mann from Germany, and Hugo von Hofmannsthal from Vienna.\n\nScofield Thayer was the magazine's editor-in-chief from 1920 to 1926, and Watson was publisher and president from 1920 until its end in 1929. Several managing editors worked for \"The Dial\" during the twenties: Gilbert Seldes (1922–23), Kenneth Burke (1923), Alyse Gregory (1923–25). Due to Thayer's nervous breakdown, he left \"The Dial\" in 1925 and formally resigned in 1926. Marianne Moore, a contributor to \"The Dial\" and advisor, became Managing Editor in 1925. She became the magazine's editor-in-chief upon Thayer's resignation.\n\nScofield Thayer's mental health continued to deteriorate, and he was hospitalized in 1927. Around this time, Watson began to delve in avant garde films, leaving Moore to her own auspices as editor-in-chief. Toward the end of the magazine's run, the staff felt that they were staying on because of an obligation to continue rather than a drive to be a strong, modern magazine. When the magazine ended in 1929, the staff was confident that the precedent they set would be carried on by other magazines.\n\nIn June 1921, Thayer and Watson announced the creation of the Dial Award, $2000 to be presented to one of its contributors, acknowledging their \"service to letters\" in hopes of providing the artist with \"leisure through which at least one artist may serve God (or go to the Devil) according to his own lights.\" The first of these awards was granted in January 1922 to Sherwood Anderson for work he had published in the magazine in 1921. Eight Dial Awards were given in all.\n\nIn its literary phase, \"The Dial\" was published monthly. Notable contributors for each of its volumes (six-month intervals) are summarized below.\n\n\n"}

She is also sometimes considered the daughter of Zeus, or a creation of Prometheus. The elusive goddess is said to have hidden in the bottom of a holy well. She is depicted both as a virgin dressed in white and as the \"naked truth\" (\"nuda veritas\") holding a hand mirror.\n\nVeritas is also the name given to the Roman virtue of truthfulness, which was considered one of the main virtues any good Roman should possess. The Greek goddess of truth is Aletheia (Ancient Greek: ). The German philosopher Martin Heidegger argues that the truth represented by \"aletheia\" (which essentially means \"unconcealment\") is different from that represented by \"veritas\", which is linked to a Roman understanding of rightness and finally to a Nietzschean sense of justice and a will to power. \n\nIn Western culture, the word may also serve as a motto.\n\nThis Latin word \"\"veritas\" now appears in the mottos of many colleges and universities. It is typically capitalized in mottoes (as \"Veritas\"\") for being an ideal (such as: Truth, Kindness and Beauty). \"Veritas\" is the motto of Hutchesons' Grammar School, Harvard University, The University of Western Ontario, Drake University, Knox College (Illinois), Bilkent University, the University of California - Hastings College of the Law, as well as the Dominican Order of the Roman Catholic Church, and Providence College and Molloy College which is run by the Dominicans. Additionally, the word appears in mottoes that are phrases, or lists e.g. the Buckley School of the City of New York employs the phrase \"Honor et Veritas\", the University of Indonesia's motto is \"Veritas, Probitas, Iustitia\", the University of Cape Coast in Ghana's motto is \"Veritas Nobis Lumen\", the University of Michigan's motto is: \"Artes, Scientia, Veritas\". Doshisha University in Kyoto, Japan's motto is \"Veritas Liberabit Vos\".\n\nCaldwell College in Caldwell, New Jersey issues a \"Veritas Award\" each year in honor of the Dominican Sisters who founded and administer the college. \"Veritas\" is included in the motto of Indiana University and Yale University, \"Lux et Veritas\" (\"Light and Truth\"). It also appears on the California State University's motto \"Vox Veritas Vita\" (\"Speak the Truth as a way of Life\"). \"Veritas vos liberabit\" (\"The Truth Will Set You Free\") is the motto of The Johns Hopkins University. \"Veritas Curat\" (\"Truth Cures\") is the motto of the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research, a medical school in Puducherry, India. Howard University, in Washington, D.C., goes by the motto \"Veritas et Utilitas\", translated to \"Truth and Service\", which is also a motto \"Truth-Service\" of Payap University, Thailand. It also exists in the logo of Seoul National University, Korea: \"Veritas Lux Mea\" – meaning \"Truth is my light\".

In \"The Autobiographical Consciousness\" he explored the phenomenological subject, the \"I\" or self conceived both as an embodied existence and as transcendental.

{"id": "1647335", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1647335", "title": "William Thompson (philosopher)", "text": "William Thompson (philosopher)\n\nWilliam Thompson (1775 – 28 March 1833) was an Irish political and philosophical writer and social reformer, developing from utilitarianism into an early critic of capitalist exploitation whose ideas influenced the Cooperative, Trade Union and Chartist movements as well as Karl Marx. Born into the Anglo-Irish Ascendancy of wealthy landowners and merchants of Cork society, his attempt to will his estate to the cooperative movement after his death sparked a long court case as his family fought successfully to have the will annulled. According to E. T. Craig, this decision to will his estate to the cooperative movement was taken after a visit to the pioneering Ralahine Commune. Marxist James Connolly described him as the \"first Irish socialist\" and a forerunner to Marx.\n\nBorn in Cork, William was the son and heir of one of the most prosperous merchants of that city, Alderman John Thompson, who held, amongst other offices, that of Mayor in 1794. William inherited the small trading fleet and landed estate near Glandore, West Cork after his father's death in 1814. Rejecting the role of absentee landlord commonly led by those of a similar situation, William based his living quarters on the estate and despite many travels, invested much time with the tenants on the estate introducing agricultural innovations, services and education for children aimed at improving the welfare and prosperity of the families present.\n\nVictim of weak health from an early age, Thompson became a non-smoker, teetotaller and vegetarian for the last 13 years of his life. These abstemious habits, he explained, helped him to concentrate on his reading and writing. Nonetheless, by the 1830s, he was suffering from a chest affliction that finally killed him on 28 March 1833. He had never married and left no direct heir.\n\nThompson was an atheist.\n\nAn enthusiastic student of the writers and ideas of the Enlightenment, particularly Condorcet, Thompson became a convinced egalitarian and democrat. His support for the French Revolution earned him the label of \"Red Republican\" from Cork society and his support for advocates of Catholic emancipation in elections further alienated him from the rest of his wealthy Protestant kith and kin.\n\nThompson was greatly impressed by the utilitarianism of Jeremy Bentham, with whom he corresponded and established a friendship, later staying at the English philosopher's house for several months in 1821–22 while visiting London.\nAs well as Bentham, Thompson read and corresponded with other utilitarian contemporaries such as James Mill, and was influenced, both positively and negatively, by William Godwin and Thomas Malthus.\nHis desire to overcome the limitations of Godwin's \"intellectual speculations\" and Malthus's \"mechanical speculations\" led him to propose a new synthesis: social science – Thompson was the first to introduce this term – which would combine political economy's concern with scientific materialism with utilitarianism's concern with rational morality.\n\nIt was the contrasting ideas of Godwin and Malthus that spurred Thompson into the project of research into the role of distribution in political economy that led him to London and, in 1824, the publication of \"An Inquiry into the Principles of the Distribution of Wealth\" (see biblio. for full title).\nThompson had also become acquainted with the work of the French utopian socialists including Charles Fourier, Henri Saint-Simon, and the economist Sismondi.\n\nIn the \"Inquiry\", Thompson follows the line of the labour theory of value put forward by Adam Smith.\nHowever he characterizes the appropriation of the lion's share of surplus value by the capitalist owner of the tools of production as exploitation.\nHe rejects the Malthus/Mill proposition that any increase in the wage of the workers can only result in their further immiseration, noting the self-serving nature of this theory for capitalists pressing for legislation to outlaw workers efforts to raise their wages.\nBy applying the utilitarian principle of \"the greatest good for the greatest number\" to the existing and possible alternative schemes of distribution, Thompson comes down on the side of an egalitarian distribution of the product.\n\nOne of Thompson's colleagues in the Cooperative movement, John Minter Morgan, made the observation that he was the first to coin the term \"competitive\" to describe the existing economic system. The case for the originality of this work is further made by Max Nettlau who states: \"[Thompson's] book, however, discloses his own evolution; having started with a demand for the full product of labour as well as the regulation of distribution, he ended up with his own conversion to communism, that is, unlimited distribution.\"\n\nIn 1827 fellow \"Ricardian socialist\" Thomas Hodgskin published \"Labour Defended\" which also characterised the appropriation of the lion's share of the fruits of production by landlord and capitalist as exploitation defrauding the worker of the full product of their labour.\nHowever, Hodgskin proposed that the road to economic justice for the labourer was through a reformed competitive system. Thompson replied with \"Labor Rewarded\" defending cooperative communism against Hodgskin's unequal wages.\n\nAlthough he rejected the political and economic implications of Malthus' essay on population, Thompson recognised that, particularly in Ireland, unrestrained population growth did pose the threat of rising poverty.\nAs such he was like Bentham and Francis Place an advocate of the benefits of contraception.\nThompson's development of a critique of the contemporary status of women was most strongly influenced by his long-term close friendship with Anna Wheeler.\nHe had met Wheeler while staying with Bentham and they moved in those utilitarian circles that included James Mill.\nIt was the publication of the latter's \"On Government\" which called for the vote for men only, that aroused the fervent opposition of both Wheeler and Thompson and to the rebuttal in \"Appeal of One Half the Human Race...\" (see Bibliography for full title).\n\nThompson and others of the Cooperative movement have tended to be somewhat unfairly subsumed under the political label of Owenism. In fact, although his writings and social experiments at New Lanark had helped to bring the cooperative movement together, many, Thompson included, were critical of Owen's authoritarian and anti-democratic tendencies. Thompson further distrusted Owen's courtship of rich and powerful patrons, believing that the rich as a class could never be expected to be in favour of any project of emancipation for the labouring poor as this would threaten their privilege. He also believed in the necessity of the workers in any co-operative community having eventual security of ownership of the community's land and capital property. He gained a considerable following within the cooperative movement for these positions and it was to distinguish themselves from Owen's positions that this wing of the movement began to adopt the label of \"socialist or communionist\" (Letter to \"The Cooperative Magazine\", London, November 1827, cited by OED as first documented use of socialist) rather than \"Owenist\".\n\nThese differences led to open confrontation between Thompson and Owen at the Third Cooperative Congress held in 1832 in London.\nOwen, perhaps discouraged by the failure of his attempted community at New Harmony, maintained that it was necessary to wait for Government and Stock Exchange support and investment into large scale communities.\nThompson and his supporters contended that they must move towards establishing independent small scale communities based on the movement's own resources.\nThe argument was not resolved at that congress and by the following one Thompson was unable to attend probably as a result of the illness that was to lead to his death in another five months.\n\nKarl Marx had come across Thompson's work on a visit to Manchester in 1845, and cites it in passing in \"The Poverty of Philosophy\" (1847), and also in \"Capital\" itself.\n\n\n\n\n"}
