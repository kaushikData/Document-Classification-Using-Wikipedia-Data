{"id": "43283496", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=43283496", "title": "Alambana", "text": "Alambana\n\nĀlambana (Sanskrit:आलम्बन), is a Sanskrit noun which variously means – support, foundation, supporting, base, sustaining, cause, reason, basis, or the five attributes of things, or the silent repetition of a prayer, or the natural and necessary connection of a sensation with the cause which excites it, or the mental exercise practiced by the yogis in endeavouring to realize the gross form of the Eternal.\n\nIn Indian philosophy the word, \"ālambana\", refers to the objective basis of a perception or sensation; according to which philosophy \"Kārana\" (cause) and all attendant emotional conditions are known as \"Vibhavas\" which are of two kinds – a) \"Ālambana\", the personal and human object and substratum, and b) \"Uddipana\", the excitant. \"Ālambana\" may further be divided into \"asraya\" and \"visaya\", Radha is \"asraya\" and Krishna is \"visaya\"; Radha, as the devotee, experienced greater pleasure than Krishna who remained the object of her veneration. \"Visaya\" is the potential object of a perceptual consciousness, \"ālambana\" is the objective basis which can even be the cause of perceptual or cognition support for a perceptual error. The Nyaya school does not consider the object in front to be the \"ālambana\" of the illusory cognition but rather the interfering external element with its own characteristics. The best \"ālambana\" for the \"upasana\" of Brahman is Om.\n\nIn Vedic parlance, \"ālambana\" is also known as \"skambha\" i.e. the pillar of strength; God is the pillar of strength; it is the objective contemplation which lends support to the mind in its travel Godwards.\n\nIn the Indian theory of Rasa, \"Uddipana\" is the excitant or determinant which inflames sentiments or emotions, and \"ālambana\" is that on which the sentiment hangs i.e. \"ālambana\" is with reference to the sentiment which arises as the link between a sentiment and the cause which excites it. In \"Rasa\" process, the nature or object is said to be visibly present before the \"asraya\" as an excitant but the object that arouses emotions is usually imagined by the poet or dramatist; the mere presence of \"vibhava\" impels the configuration of \"Pratibha\" (the intuitive outcome of wisdom or knowledge) to change it in no time. As per the Rasa of Heroic devotion in compassion the enhancing excitants include transitory emotions such as impatience, understanding and happiness, and Krishna in some disguised form is offered by the hero, motivated by kindness, his own body. Yuddhisthira had made sacrificial offerings to Krishna.\n\nWith the aid of self-supported yoga or ātmālmbana yoga, Ishvara can be seen in two ways i.e. dual and non-dual, or can be seen as fourfolded. \"Ālambana\" refers to inner support and yoga refers to self-discipline; \"ātmālambana yoga\" is the discipline of objectifying the non-self with the aid of the self when the negated-self becomes the object of the self.\n\nPatanjali while defining Sleep which is a vritti of Buddhi, just as the waking state and the dream states are, tells us:\n\nHere, he has used the word, \"ālambana\", to mean support or based on i.e. absence of impressions is supported / based on inertia.\n\nAccording to the Yogacara phenomenology the \"ālambana\" condition, whether immediate direct or remote, means if there exists a dharma it will have a distinct appearance, the mind will sometimes correspond with it (\"lakshana\") for that \"dharma\" to be cognized and perceptually grasped. This condition leads to the awakening which results in the ending of the eight consciousnesses and replacing them with four enlightened cognitive abilities. The Buddhist consider \"ālambana\" as a cause same as \"hetu\", \"samanantara\" and \"adhipati\", they consider it to be the object-condition which is taken as the cause in the production of knowledge and mentals, such as \"citta\" and \"caitta\".\nAccording to Nagarjuna there are three motivational contexts of love and compassion viz, \"sattva-ālambana\", motivated by the similarity of one’s self with other selves, \"dharma-ālambana\", motivated by the sameness of psycho-physical elements, and \"ānalambana\" which is not motivated by these two i.e. which is independent of motivational context. Xuanzang in the context of Dignāga’s statement with reference to the eighth consciousness explains that the seeds or virtualities of the eighth consciousness produce the actual consciousness and also the objective base (ālambana) of actual consciousness.\n"}
{"id": "991283", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=991283", "title": "Allah Hoo", "text": "Allah Hoo\n\nAllah Hoo (Allah hu) is a traditional Sufi chant (Dhikr)\nconsisting of the word for God ( \"\") run together three times, followed by Truth (Haqq):\nitself repeated three times over. According to Sufi tradition, this formula was introduced by Abu Bakr as he initiated the Naqshbandi tradition (Kabbani 2003 p. 87). Other Dhikrs consist of simple \"Allāhu Allāhu\" run together 400 or 600 times.\n\n\"Allah Hoo\" is also a popular title for Urdu language Sufi devotional qawwalis.\n\nThe \"Hoo\" is due to the nominative suffix (i`rab) \"-u\" (ḍamma) being pronounced before initial vowel, as the word \"Allahu\" is run together several times: \"Allahu Allahu Allahu\" is rendered as /al:a:hual:a:hual:a:h/ (compare the phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" where the \"-u\" is also audible). In traditional Sufi chant, the length of the \"-u\" is exaggerated. As a noun phrase, the chant is interpreted as meaning \"God is\". Haqq is the Arabic for \"truth\", so that the full dhikr translates to \"God is. God is. God is Truth.\"\n\nQawwalis titled \"Allah Hoo\" have been performed by many different qawwals. Although these songs have the same title, many of them are totally different songs. For example, the \"Allah Hoo\" that appears on the Sabri Brothers 1998 CD \"Qawwali: Sufi Music from Pakistan\" is totally different from the song that became one of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's signature qawwalis, and this in turn is totally different from Qawwal Bahauddin's version on the 1991 Shalimar compilation video titled \"Tajdar-e-Haram, vol. 2\" (although all three songs do have some lyrics in common). Versions of the song have also been sung by many other qawwals and Sufi singers, including Hans Raj Hans, Master Salim, and Faiz Ali Faiz. Versions of the song have been translated into other languages. An English version is sung by Sami Yusuf on the album Al-Mu`allim (2003), while a Malay version is sung by a popular Malaysian Nasheed group, Raihan.\n\nIt is also a song by Sufi rock musician Salman Ahmad, formerly of Junoon, the Pakistani rock band.\n\nIn 1st season of \"Coke Studio (Pakistan)\", \"Allah Hu\" was sung by Ali Zafar along with Saaein Tufail Ahmed in 2008.\n\nIn 2nd season of \"Coke Studio (India)\", \"Allah Hu\" was sung by Nooran sisters composed by Hitesh solanki in 2012.\n\n\"Allah Hu\" in its basic naat form was penned by the late Maulana Syed Hasan Imdad of Pakistan.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "339", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=339", "title": "Ayn Rand", "text": "Ayn Rand\n\nAyn Rand (; born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum;  – March 6, 1982) was a Russian-American writer and philosopher. She is known for her two best-selling novels, \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\", and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism. Educated in Russia, she moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935 and 1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, \"The Fountainhead\". In 1957, Rand published her best-known work, the novel \"Atlas Shrugged\". Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982.\n\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism. In politics, she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism and statism as well as anarchism, instead supporting \"laissez-faire\" capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights, including property rights. In art, Rand promoted romantic realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals.\n\nLiterary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.\n\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum () on February 2, 1905, to a Russian-Jewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg. She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan). Her father was upwardly mobile and a pharmacist and her mother was socially ambitious and religiously observant. Rand later said she found school unchallenging and began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten. At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was Vladimir Nabokov's younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates at the Nabokov mansion: while Olga defended constitutional monarchy, Alisa supported republican ideals.\n\nShe was twelve at the time of the February Revolution of 1917, during which she favored Alexander Kerensky over Tsar Nicholas II. The subsequent October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father's business was confiscated, and the family fled to the Crimean Peninsula, which was initially under control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War. While in high school, she realized that she was an atheist and valued reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea in June 1921, she returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.\nAfter the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing her to be in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University. At the age of 16, she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy, majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of Aristotle and Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. She also studied the philosophical works of Friedrich Nietzsche. Able to read French, German and Russian, she also discovered the writers Fyodor Dostoevsky, Victor Hugo, Edmond Rostand, and Friedrich Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.\n\nAlong with many other bourgeois students, she was purged from the university shortly before graduating. After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, however, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which she did in October 1924. She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For an assignment she wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri, which became her first published work.\n\nBy this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be \"Rand\", possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt of her birth surname in Cyrillic handwriting, and she adopted the first name \"Ayn\", either from a Finnish name \"Aino\" or from the Hebrew word (\"ayin\", meaning \"eye\").\n\nIn late 1925, Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago. She departed on January 17, 1926. When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of Manhattan that she cried what she later called \"tears of splendor\". Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with her relatives, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films free of charge. She then left for Hollywood, California.\n\nIn Hollywood, a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B. DeMille led to work as an extra in his film \"The King of Kings\" and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter. While working on \"The King of Kings\", she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March 3, 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at RKO Studios. She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.\n\nRand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay \"Red Pawn\" to Universal Studios in 1932, although it was never produced. This was followed by the courtroom drama \"Night of January 16th\", first produced by E. E. Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on Broadway in 1935. Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience; based on the jury's vote, one of two different endings would be performed. In 1941, Paramount Pictures produced a movie loosely based on the play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result. \"Ideal\" is a novel and play written in 1934 which were first published in 2015 by her estate. The heroine is an actress who embodies Randian ideals.\n\nRand's first published novel, the semi-autobiographical \"We the Living\", was published in 1936. Set in Soviet Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that \"We the Living\" \"is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not ...\" Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. In 1942, without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, \"Noi vivi\" and \"Addio, Kira\". Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as \"We the Living\" in 1986.\n\nHer novella \"Anthem\" was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, \"The Fountainhead\". It presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with \"We the Living\", Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Rand became politically active. She and her husband worked as full-time volunteers for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican Wendell Willkie. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences; she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had viewed pro-Willkie newsreels. This activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Mises once referred to Rand as \"the most courageous man in America\", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said \"man\" instead of \"woman\". Rand also became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson. Rand questioned Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only non-fiction book, \"The God of the Machine\".\n\nRand's first major success as a writer came in 1943 with \"The Fountainhead\", a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as \"second-handers\"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel, but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.\n\n\"The Fountainhead\" became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a film version to Warner Bros. and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer Hal B. Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the Oscar-nominated \"Love Letters\" and \"You Came Along\". Rand also worked on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called \"The Moral Basis of Individualism\". Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled \"The Only Path to Tomorrow\" in the January 1944 edition of \"Reader's Digest\" magazine.\nRand extended her involvement with free-market and anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist American Writers Association. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments, which Rand considered rude, to valued political allies. In 1947, during the Second Red Scare, Rand testified as a \"friendly witness\" before the United States House Un-American Activities Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the Soviet Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film \"Song of Russia\". Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was. She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as \"futile\".\n\nAfter several delays, the film version of \"The Fountainhead\" was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she \"disliked the movie from beginning to end\", and complained about its editing, acting, and other elements.\n\nIn the years following the publication of \"The Fountainhead\", Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom the book profoundly influenced. In 1951, Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated \"The Collective\") included future Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later Nathaniel Branden) and his wife Barbara and Barbara's cousin Leonard Peikoff. Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. She later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, \"Atlas Shrugged\", as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.\n\n\"Atlas Shrugged\", published in 1957, was considered Rand's \"magnum opus\". Rand described the theme of the novel as \"the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest\". It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, John Galt, describes the strike as \"stopping the motor of the world\" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of mystery, romance, and science fiction, and it contains an extended exposition of Objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.\n\nDespite many negative reviews, \"Atlas Shrugged\" became an international bestseller. In an interview with Mike Wallace, Rand declared herself \"the most creative thinker alive\". However, Rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the novel. \"Atlas Shrugged\" was Rand's last completed work of fiction; it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.\n\nIn 1958, Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for Objectivist periodicals that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, later described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the Objectivist movement itself as a cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. However, some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated, and the problem was concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as Yale, Princeton, Columbia, Harvard, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Lewis & Clark College on 2 October 1963. She also began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience. During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft (but condemning many draft dodgers as \"bums\"), supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as \"civilized men fighting savages\", saying European colonists had the right to develop land taken from American Indians, and calling homosexuality \"immoral\" and \"disgusting\", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it. She also endorsed several Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for \"The Objectivist Newsletter\".\nIn 1964, Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI. Rand published an article in \"The Objectivist\" repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other \"irrational behavior in his private life\". Branden later apologized in an interview to \"every student of Objectivism\" for \"perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique\" and for \"contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement\". In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.\n\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking. In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, she allowed social worker Evva Pryor, an employee of her attorney, to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare. During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of \"Atlas Shrugged\".\n\nRand died of heart failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City, and was interred in the Kensico Cemetery, Valhalla, New York. Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including Alan Greenspan. A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named Leonard Peikoff to inherit her estate.\n\nRand called her philosophy \"Objectivism\", describing its essence as \"the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute\". She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.\n\nIn metaphysics, Rand supported philosophical realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion.\n\nIn epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered axiomatic, and reason, which she described as \"the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses\". She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or \"a priori\" knowledge, including instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing. In her \"Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology\", Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy.\n\nIn ethics, Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should \"exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself\". She referred to egoism as \"the virtue of selfishness\" in her book of that title, in which she presented her solution to the is-ought problem by describing a meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of \"man's survival \"qua\" man\". She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational, writing in \"Atlas Shrugged\" that \"Force and mind are opposites.\"\n\nRand's political philosophy emphasized individual rights (including property rights), and she considered \"laissez-faire\" capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. She opposed statism, which she understood to include theocracy, absolute monarchy, Nazism, fascism, communism, democratic socialism, and dictatorship. Rand believed that natural rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian, she preferred the term \"radical for capitalism\". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.\n\nIn aesthetics, Rand defined art as a \"selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments\". According to her, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will. She described her own approach to literature as \"romantic realism\".\n\nRand acknowledged Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend \"three A's\"—Aristotle, Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from she responded: \"Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself.\" However, she also found early inspiration in Friedrich Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of \"We the Living\" (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote \"The Fountainhead\", Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. Rational egoism was embodied by Russian author Nikolay Chernyshevsky in the 1863 novel \"What Is to Be Done?\" and several critics claim that \"What Is to Be Done?\" is one of the sources of inspiration for Rand's thought. For example, the book's main character Lopuhov says \"I am not a man to make sacrifices. And indeed there are no such things. One acts in the way that one finds most pleasant.\" Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was Immanuel Kant, whom she referred to as a \"monster\", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.\n\nRand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her \"theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force\". She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating: \"I am not \"primarily\" an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not \"primarily\" an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows.\"\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, \"We the Living\", was admired by the literary critic H. L. Mencken, her Broadway play \"Night of January 16th\" was both a critical and popular success, and \"The Fountainhead\" was hailed by \"The New York Times\" reviewer Lorine Pruette as \"masterful\". Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic. However, they became bestsellers largely through word of mouth.\n\nThe first reviews Rand received were for \"Night of January 16th\". Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Rand believed that her first novel, \"We the Living\", was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says \"it was the most reviewed of any of her works\", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. Her 1938 novella \"Anthem\" received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.\n\nRand's first bestseller, \"The Fountainhead\", received far fewer reviews than \"We the Living\", and reviewers' opinions were mixed. Lorine Pruette's positive review in \"The New York Times\" was one that Rand greatly appreciated. Pruette called Rand \"a writer of great power\" who wrote \"brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly\", and stated that \"you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time\". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it \"a whale of a book\" and another that said \"anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing\". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style \"offensively pedestrian\".\n\nRand's 1957 novel \"Atlas Shrugged\" was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative. In \"National Review\", conservative author Whittaker Chambers called the book \"sophomoric\" and \"remarkably silly\". He described the tone of the book as \"shrillness without reprieve\" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the Soviets), claiming \"From almost any page of \"Atlas Shrugged\", a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go!. \"Atlas Shrugged\" received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer John Chamberlain, but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that \"reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs\", calling it \"execrable claptrap\" and \"a nightmare\"—they also said it was \"written out of hate\" and showed \"remorseless hectoring and prolixity\".\n\nRand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, \"For the New Intellectual\", was similar to that for \"Atlas Shrugged\", with philosopher Sidney Hook likening her certainty to \"the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union\", and author Gore Vidal calling her viewpoint \"nearly perfect in its immorality\". Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.\n\nOn the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for \"The New York Times\", referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian \"retro fantasy\" and programmatic neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters' \"isolated rejection of democratic society\". In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as \"romance novels with a patina of pseudo-philosophy\". In 2009, \"GQ\"s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as \"capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels\" such as \"\" and the \"Left Behind\" series.\n\nIn 1991, a survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\" was the second most popular choice, after the Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted \"Atlas Shrugged\" the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by \"The Fountainhead\" in second place, \"Anthem\" in seventh, and \"We the Living\" eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list. Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.\n\nRand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as Ira Levin, Kay Nolte Smith and L. Neil Smith; and later writers such as Erika Holzer and Terry Goodkind have been influenced by her. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist Steve Ditko and musician Neil Peart of Rush. Rand provided a positive view of business and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. John Allison of BB&T and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while Mark Cuban (owner of the Dallas Mavericks) as well as John P. Mackey (CEO of Whole Foods) among others have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.\n\nRand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games. She, or a character based on her, figures prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors. Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of \"Reason\", has remarked that \"Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist...\" and that \"jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture\". Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, \"\", was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. \"The Passion of Ayn Rand\", a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name, won several awards. Rand's image also appears on a 1999 U.S. postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano.\n\nAlthough she rejected the labels \"conservative\" and \"libertarian\", Rand has had continuing influence on right-wing politics and libertarianism. Jim Powell, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson) of modern American libertarianism, and David Nolan, one of the founders of the Libertarian Party, stated that \"without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist\". In his history of the libertarian movement, journalist Brian Doherty described her as \"the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large\" and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as \"the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\". Economist and Ayn Rand student George Reisman wrote: \"Ayn Rand...in particular, must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism, and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of pro-capitalist ideas.\"\nShe faced intense opposition from William F. Buckley, Jr. and other contributors for the \"National Review\" magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by Whittaker Chambers, Garry Wills, and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other \"National Review\" contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.\n\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being pro-choice and an atheist. A 1987 article in \"The New York Times\" referred to her as the Reagan administration's \"novelist laureate\". Republican Congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels.\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works, especially \"Atlas Shrugged\", which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis. Opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel. During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests. There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the political left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets, particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan. For example, \"Mother Jones\" remarked that \"Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed\" while equating Randian individual well-being with that of the \"Volk\" according to Goebbels. Corey Robin of \"The Nation\" alleged similarities between the \"moral syntax of Randianism\" and fascism.\n\nDuring Rand's lifetime, her work received little attention from academic scholars. When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand \"a treacherous undertaking\" that could lead to \"guilt by association\" for taking her seriously. A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in \"The Personalist\". One of these was \"On the Randian Argument\" by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick, who argued that her meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the is–ought problem posed by David Hume. Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in \"The Personalist\" arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case. Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.\n\nSince Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased. Historian Jennifer Burns has identified \"three overlapping waves\" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is \"an explosion of scholarship\" since the year 2000. However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.\n\nGladstein, Harry Binswanger, Allan Gotthelf, John Hospers, Edwin A. Locke, Wallace Matson, Leonard Peikoff, Chris Matthew Sciabarra, and Tara Smith have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the \"Journal of Ayn Rand Studies\", a nonpartisan peer-reviewed journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work. In 1987 Gotthelf, George Walsh and David Kelley co-founded the Ayn Rand Society, a group affiliated with the American Philosophical Association. In 2012, the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an \"Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies\" series based on the proceedings of the Society. Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including \"Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist\", a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by Cambridge University Press. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at Clemson and Duke universities. Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.\n\nRand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B. Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as \"literary, hyperbolic and emotional\". Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite \"the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage\", Rand's ethics are \"a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought\". In the \"Literary Encyclopedia\" entry for Rand written in 2001, John David Lewis declared that \"Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation\". In a 1999 interview in the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", Sciabarra commented, \"I know they laugh at Rand\", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.\n\nLibertarian philosopher Michael Huemer argues that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics, which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence. He attributes the attention she receives to her being a \"compelling writer\", especially as a novelist. \"Atlas Shrugged\" thus outsells Rand's non-fiction works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek, or Frederic Bastiat.\n\nPolitical scientist Charles Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only \"philosophical debt\" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche. Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.\n\nIn 1985, Rand's intellectual heir Leonard Peikoff established the Ayn Rand Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff, philosopher David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as The Atlas Society. In 2001, historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia. The charitable foundation of BB&T Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The University of Texas at Austin, the University of Pittsburgh, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases, these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.\n\nNovels:\n\nOther fiction:\n\nNon-fiction:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "95429", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95429", "title": "Bonaventure", "text": "Bonaventure\n\nSaint Bonaventure (; ; 1221 – 15 July 1274), born Giovanni di Fidanza, was an Italian medieval Franciscan, scholastic theologian and philosopher. The seventh Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor, he was also Cardinal Bishop of Albano. He was canonised on 14 April 1482 by Pope Sixtus IV and declared a Doctor of the Church in the year 1588 by Pope Sixtus V. He is known as the \"Seraphic Doctor\" (). Many writings believed in the Middle Ages to be his are now collected under the name Pseudo-Bonaventure.\n\nHe was born at Bagnorea in Umbria, not far from Viterbo, then part of the Papal States. Almost nothing is known of his childhood, other than the names of his parents, Giovanni di Fidanza and Maria di Ritella.\n\nHe entered the Franciscan Order in 1243 and studied at the University of Paris, possibly under Alexander of Hales, and certainly under Alexander's successor, John of Rochelle. In 1253 he held the Franciscan chair at Paris. A dispute between seculars and mendicants delayed his reception as Master until 1257, where his degree was taken in company with Thomas Aquinas. Three years earlier his fame had earned him the position of lecturer on \"The Four Books of Sentences\"—a book of theology written by Peter Lombard in the twelfth century—and in 1255 he received the degree of master, the medieval equivalent of doctor.\n\nAfter having successfully defended his order against the reproaches of the anti-mendicant party, he was elected Minister General of the Franciscan Order. On 24 November 1265, he was selected for the post of Archbishop of York; however, he was never consecrated and resigned the appointment in October 1266.\n\nDuring his tenure, the General Chapter of Narbonne, held in 1260, promulgated a decree prohibiting the publication of any work out of the order without permission from the higher superiors. This prohibition has induced modern writers to pass severe judgment upon Roger Bacon's superiors being envious of Bacon's abilities. However, the prohibition enjoined on Bacon was a general one, which extended to the whole order. Its promulgation was not directed against him, but rather against Gerard of Borgo San Donnino. Gerard had published in 1254 without permission a heretical work, \"Introductorius in Evangelium æternum\" (\"An Introduction to the Eternal Gospel\"). Thereupon the General Chapter of Narbonne promulgated the above-mentioned decree, identical with the \"constitutio gravis in contrarium\" Bacon speaks of. The above-mentioned prohibition was rescinded in Roger's favour unexpectedly in 1266.\n\nBonaventure was instrumental in procuring the election of Pope Gregory X, who rewarded him with the title of Cardinal Bishop of Albano, and insisted on his presence at the great Second Council of Lyon in 1274. There, after his significant contributions led to a union of the Greek and Latin churches, Bonaventure died suddenly and in suspicious circumstances. The 1913 edition of the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" has citations that suggest he was poisoned, but no mention is made of this in the 2003 second edition of the New Catholic Encyclopedia. The only extant relic of the saint is the arm and hand with which he wrote his \"Commentary on the Sentences\", which is now conserved at Bagnoregio, in the parish church of St. Nicholas.\n\nHe steered the Franciscans on a moderate and intellectual course that made them the most prominent order in the Catholic Church until the coming of the Jesuits. His theology was marked by an attempt completely to integrate faith and reason. He thought of Christ as the \"one true master\" who offers humans knowledge that begins in faith, is developed through rational understanding, and is perfected by mystical union with God.\n\nBonaventure's feast day was included in the General Roman Calendar immediately upon his canonisation in 1482. It was at first celebrated on the second Sunday in July, but was moved in 1568 to 14 July, since 15 July, the anniversary of his death, was at that time taken up with the feast of Saint Henry. It remained on that date, with the rank of \"double\", until 1960, when it was reclassified as a feast of the third class. In 1969 it was classified as an obligatory memorial and assigned to the date of his death, 15 July.\n\nBonaventure was formally canonised in 1484 by the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, and ranked along with Thomas Aquinas as the greatest of the Doctors of the Church by another Franciscan, Pope Sixtus V, in 1587. Bonaventure was regarded as one of the greatest philosophers of the Middle Ages.\n\nHis works, as arranged in the most recent Critical Edition by the Quaracchi Fathers (Collegio S. Bonaventura), consist of a \"Commentary on the Sentences of Lombard\", in four volumes, and eight other volumes, including a \"Commentary on the Gospel of St Luke\" and a number of smaller works; the most famous of which are \"The Mind's Road to God\" (\"Itinerarium mentis in Deum\"), an outline of his theology or \"Brief Reading\" (\"Breviloquium\"), \"Reduction of the Arts to Theology\" (\"De reductione artium ad theologiam\"), and Soliloquy on the Four Spiritual Exercises (\"Soliloquium de quatuor mentalibus exercitiis\"), \"The Tree of Life\" (\"Lignum vitae\"), and \"The Triple Way\" (\"De Triplici via\"), the latter three written for the spiritual direction of his fellow Franciscans.\n\nThe German philosopher Dieter Hattrup denies that \"Reduction of the Arts to Theology\" was written by Bonaventure, claiming that the style of thinking does not match Bonaventure's original style. His position is no longer tenable given recent research: the text remains \"indubitably authentic\". A work that for many years was falsely attributed to Bonaventure, \"De septem itineribus aeternitatis\", was actually written by Rudolf von Biberach (c. 1270 – 1329).\n\nFor St. Isabelle of France, the sister of King St. Louis IX of France, and her monastery of Poor Clares at Longchamps, St. Bonaventure wrote the treatise, \"Concerning the Perfection of Life.\"\n\nThe Commentary on the \"Sentences\", written at the command of his superiors when he was twenty-seven, is Bonaventure's major work and most of his other theological and philosophical writings are in some way dependent on it. However, some of Bonaventure's later works, such as the \"Lectures on the Six Days of Creation\", show substantial developments beyond the \"Sentences\".\n\nBonaventure wrote on almost every subject treated by the Schoolmen, and his writings are very numerous. The greater number of them deal with philosophy and theology. No work of Bonaventure's is exclusively philosophical, a striking illustration of the mutual interpenetration of philosophy and theology that is a distinguishing mark of the Scholastic period.\n\nMuch of St. Bonaventure’s philosophical thought shows a considerable influence by St. Augustine. So much so that De Wulf considers him the best medieval representative of Augustinianism. St. Bonaventure adds Aristotelian principles to the Augustinian doctrine, especially in connection with the illumination of the intellect and the composition of human beings and other living creatures in terms of matter and form. Augustine, who had introduced into the west many of the doctrines that would define scholastic philosophy, was an incredibly important source of Bonaventure's Platonism. The mystic Dionysius the Areopagite was another notable influence.\n\nIn philosophy Bonaventure presents a marked contrast to his contemporaries, Roger Bacon, Albert the Great, and Thomas Aquinas. While these may be taken as representing, respectively, physical science yet in its infancy, and Aristotelian scholasticism in its most perfect form, he presents the mystical and Platonizing mode of speculation that had already, to some extent, found expression in Hugo and Richard of St. Victor, Alexander of Hales, and in Bernard of Clairvaux. To him, the purely intellectual element, though never absent, is of inferior interest when compared with the living power of the affections or the heart.\n\nLike Thomas Aquinas, with whom he shared numerous profound agreements in matters theological and philosophical, he combated the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the world vigorously (though he disagreed with Aquinas about the abstract possibility of an eternal universe). Bonaventure accepts the neo-Platonic doctrine that \"forms\" do not exist as subsistent entities, but as ideals or archetypes in the mind of God, according to which actual things were formed; and this conception has no slight influence upon his philosophy. Due to this philosophy, physicist and philosopher Max Bernhard Weinstein contended that Bonaventure showed strong pandeistic inclinations.\n\nLike all the great scholastic doctors, Bonaventura starts with the discussion of the relations between reason and faith. All the sciences are but the handmaids of theology; reason can discover some of the moral truths that form the groundwork of the Christian system, but others it can only receive and apprehend through divine illumination. To obtain this illumination, the soul must employ the proper means, which are prayer, the exercise of the virtues, whereby it is rendered fit to accept the divine light, and meditation that may rise even to ecstatic union with God. The supreme end of life is such union, union in contemplation or intellect and in intense absorbing love; but it cannot be entirely reached in this life, and remains as a hope for the future.\n\nLike Aquinas and other notable thirteenth-century philosophers and theologians, Bonaventure believed that it is possible to prove the existence of God and the immortality of the soul. He offers several arguments for the existence of God, including versions of St. Anselm's ontological argument and Augustine's argument from eternal truths. His main argument for the immortality of the soul appeals to humans' natural desire for perfect happiness, and is reminiscent of C. S. Lewis's argument from desire. Contrary to Aquinas, Bonaventure did not believe that philosophy was an autonomous disciple that could be pursued successfully independently of theology. Any philosopher is bound to fall into serious error, he believed, who lacks the light of faith.\n\nA master of the memorable phrase, Bonaventure held that philosophy opens the mind to at least three different routes humans can take on their journey to God. Non-intellectual material creatures he conceived as shadows and vestiges (literally, footprints) of God, understood as the ultimate cause of a world philosophical reason can prove was created at a first moment in time. Intellectual creatures he conceived of as images and likenesses of God, the workings of the human mind and will leading us to God understood as illuminator of knowledge and donor of grace and virtue. The final route to God is the route of being, in which Bonaventure brought Anselm's argument together with Aristotelian and Neoplatonic metaphysics to view God as the absolutely perfect being whose essence entails its existence, an absolutely simple being that causes all other, composite beings to exist.\n\nBonaventure, however, is not only a meditative thinker, whose works may form good manuals of devotion; he is a dogmatic theologian of high rank, and on all the disputed questions of scholastic thought, such as universals, matter, seminal reasons, the principle of individuation, or the intellectus agens, he gives weighty and well-reasoned decisions. He agrees with Saint Albert the Great in regarding theology as a practical science; its truths, according to his view, are peculiarly adapted to influence the affections. He discusses very carefully the nature and meaning of the divine attributes; considers universals to be the ideal forms pre-existing in the divine mind according to which things were shaped; holds matter to be pure potentiality that receives individual being and determinateness from the formative power of God, acting according to the ideas; and finally maintains that the agent intellect has no separate existence. On these and on many other points of scholastic philosophy the \"Seraphic Doctor\" exhibits a combination of subtlety and moderation, which makes his works particularly valuable.\n\nIn form and intent the work of St. Bonaventure is always the work of a theologian; he writes as one for whom the only angle of vision and the proximate criterion of truth is the Christian faith. This fact influences his importance for the history of philosophy; when coupled with his style, it makes Bonaventure perhaps the least accessible of the major figures of the thirteenth century. This is true, not because he is a theologian, but because philosophy interests him largely as a \"praeparatio evangelica\", as something to be interpreted as a foreshadow of or deviation from what God has revealed.\n\nIn a way that is not true of Aquinas or Albert or Scotus, Bonaventure does not survive well the transition from his time to ours. It is difficult to imagine a contemporary philosopher, Christian or not, citing a passage from Bonaventure to make a specifically philosophical point. One must know philosophers to read Bonaventure, but the study of Bonaventure is seldom helpful for understanding philosophers and their characteristic problems. Bonaventure as a theologian is something different again, as is Bonaventure the edifying author. It is in those areas, rather than in philosophy proper, that his continuing importance must be sought.\n\nSt. Bonaventure Catholic Church, elementary school, and cemetery, Columbus, Nebraska.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBonaventuracollege is a Dutch Catholic Highschool situated in Leiden.\n\n\n\n"}

He was later created a Cardinal-Priest of \"S. Patrizio\" by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of 28 June 1991. His death in 2009 brought to an end a two-year period during which Ireland had, for the first times in its history, three living Cardinals.\n\nConsidered \"the hierarchy's foremost theologian\", he strongly criticised the Irish Republican Army (IRA) throughout his episcopal ministry. This despite his relation to infamous IRA general Paddy Daly. Daly had many published works and was known for his views on philosophy, theology and on the Northern Ireland situation, attracting global acclaim for his part in helping to write the speech Pope John Paul II used on his 1979 visit to Drogheda to ask for an end to violence on the island.\n\nCahal Brendan Daly was born in Loughguile, County Antrim the third child of seven. His father was a primary school teacher originally from Keadue, County Roscommon and his mother a native of Antrim. He was educated at St. Patrick's National School in Loughguile, and then as a boarder in St. Malachy's College, Belfast in 1930. The writer Brian Moore was a contemporary.\n\nDaly studied Classics at Queen's University in Belfast. He earned his B.A. with Honours and also the \"Henry Medal in Latin Studies\" in 1937 and completed his M.A. the following year. He entered St Patrick's College, Maynooth and was ordained to the priesthood on 22 June 1941. He continued studies in theology in Maynooth, from where he obtained a doctorate in divinity (DD) in 1944. His first appointment was as Classics Master in St. Malachy's College (1944–1945).\n\nIn 1945 he was appointed Lecturer in Scholastic Philosophy at Queen's University, Belfast, retaining the post for 21 years. In the academic year 1952–53 Queens granted him sabbatical leave, which he spent studying at the Catholic Institute of Paris where he received a licentiate in philosophy. He would return to France at many points, particularly for holidays. He persisted with his studies well into his retirement. He was a popular figure with the university and fondly remembered by his students.\n\nDaly was a \"peritus\", or theological expert, at the Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) to Bishop William Philbin during the first session of the Council and to Cardinal William Conway for the rest of the Council. He dedicated himself to scholarship for 30 years, and published several books seeking to bring about understanding between the warring factions in Northern Ireland.\n\nDaly became a Reader in Scholastic Philosophy at Queen's University in 1963, a post he held until 1967, when he was appointed Bishop of Ardagh and Clonmacnoise on 26 May.\n\nDaly converted his forename Charles into Cahal ahead of his episcopal consecration in St. Mel's Cathedral, Longford on 16 July 1967 from Cardinal William Conway, with Archbishop Giuseppe Sensi and Bishop Neil Farren serving as co-consecrators. \n\nHe spent 15 years as bishop in Longford and was diligent about parish visitation and confirmations gradually assumed a greater national profile. From 1974 onwards, he devoted himself especially to ecumenical activities for the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. His pastoral letter to Protestants, written in 1979, pleaded for Christian unity.\n\nDaly succeeded William Philbin as the 30th Bishop of Down and Connor when he was installed as bishop of his native diocese at a ceremony in St. Peter's Cathedral Belfast on 17 October 1982.\n\nOn 6 November 1990, Daly was appointed archbishop of Armagh and, as such, Primate of All Ireland. He was aged 73 by this stage. His age made him an unexpected occupant of the post. Despite this it was requested that he stay in the role for three years before usual age of episcopal retirement at 75. Cardinal Daly took a notably harder line against the Irish Republican Army than his predecessor, Tomás Ó Fiaich.\n\nDaly was respectful of Protestant rights but opposed formal integrated education of Roman Catholics and Protestants. This policy was criticised by those who believed segregated education to be one of the causes of sectarianism in Northern Ireland, but was seen by the Roman Catholic clergy as important for passing on their faith to future generations. He was utterly orthodox in opposing divorce, contraception, abortion, the ordination of women and any idea of dropping clerical celibacy.\n\nHe was heckled by the audience on live television during a broadcast of \"The Late Late Show\" on the topic of paedophilia in the 1990s. Upon his retirement in 1996 he made no further public statement until his death. A photograph of him at the ceremony initiating Seán Brady as a Cardinal in 2007 was entered by the \"Irish Independent\" for a national award (judged by an international panel).\n\nCardinal Daly retired as Archbishop of Armagh on his 79th birthday, 1 October 1996 and subsequently suffered ill health. Although it was announced that he would attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II, he stayed home on the advice of his doctors. As he had turned 80 in 1997, he was now ineligible to participate in the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI.\n\nCardinal Daly had the motto, \"Jesus Christ, yesterday and today\" taken from . His armorial bearings are a personalised variation of the arms of the Ó Dálaigh family. As Archbishop of Armagh he impaled them with those of the Archdiocese of Armagh.\n\nDaly was admitted to the coronary unit of Belfast City Hospital on 28 December 2009. His health had already been declining, leading to prayers being ordered for him. Dr Daly died in hospital in Belfast on 31 December 2009, aged 92. His family were at his bedside at the time.\n\nIn tributes, both Taoiseach Brian Cowen and former UK prime minister Tony Blair stressed Cardinal Daly's contribution to the peace process in Northern Ireland. The deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, the Sinn Féin MLA Martin McGuinness, said it was no secret that Republicans and Cardinal Daly had never enjoyed a close relationship during The Troubles, but that relations had warmed since then. Warm tributes also came from the Primate of the Church of Ireland, the Most Rev. Alan Harper, the President of the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Rev. Donald P. Ker, and the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Rt. Rev. Dr. Stafford Carson.\n\nHe lay in state in Belfast and then his remains were taken to Armagh. Pope Benedict XVI paid tribute at this stage. Large numbers of people travelled from as far as County Westmeath to attend Mass at Armagh on 4 January, at which Monsignor Liam McEntaggart, the former parish priest of Coalisland, said, \"When the history of peace making in Ireland comes to be written, the contribution of Cardinal Daly will be accorded a high place\". Monsignor McEntaggart himself died on 22nd August 2010, aged 81, just seven months after Cardinal Daly's passing.\n\nDaly's funeral was held on 5 January 2010, attended by the president Mary McAleese and Taoiseach Brian Cowen. Cardinal Daly was buried in the grounds of St Patrick's Roman Catholic Cathedral, Armagh next to his three predecessors in the see, Cardinals Ó Fiaich, Conway and D'Alton.\n\nIn 2001, eight years before his death, Dr. Daly donated his entire set of writings to the Political Collection of the Linen Hall Library. His donation to the Library, which is bound in handsome volumes, includes 500 sermons, essays, addresses and press statements.\n\nDaly said at the time: \n\nHis collection \"Philosophy in Britain from Bradley to Wittgenstein and The Minding of Planet Earth\" was published as recently as 2004.\n\nTwo of his speeches feature in \"Teachers of the Faith: Speeches and Lectures by Catholic Bishops\", a book of international addresses by members of the clergy spanning 26 years.\n\n\n"}

He then says that without his knowledge of God's existence, none of his knowledge could be certain.\n\nThe Cartesian circle is a criticism of the above that takes this form:\nThus, Descartes' argument is circular.\n\nMany commentators, both at the time that Descartes wrote and since, have argued that this involves a circular argument, as he relies upon the principle of clarity and distinctness to argue for the existence of God, and then claims that God is the guarantor of his clear and distinct ideas. The first person to raise this criticism was Marin Mersenne, in the \"Second Set of Objections\" to the \"Meditations\":\n\"you are not yet certain of the existence of God, and you say that you are not certain of anything. It follows from this that you do not yet clearly and distinctly know that you are a thinking thing, since, on your own admission, that knowledge depends on the clear knowledge of an existing God; and this you have not proved in the passage where you draw the conclusion that you clearly know what you are.\" (AT VII 124–125)\n\nDescartes' own response to this criticism, in his \"Author's Replies to the Fourth Set of Objections\", is first to give what has become known as the Memory response; he points out that in the fifth Meditation (at AT VII 69–70) he did not say that he needed God to guarantee the truth of his clear and distinct ideas, only to guarantee his memory:\n\"when I said that we can know nothing for certain until we are aware that God exists, I expressly declared that I was speaking only of knowledge of those conclusions which can be recalled when we are no longer attending to the arguments by means of which we deduced them.\" (AT VII 140)\nSecondly, he explicitly denies that the \"cogito\" is an inference: \"When someone says 'I am thinking, therefore I am, or I exist' he does not deduce existence from thought by means of a syllogism, but recognizes it as something self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind.\" (AT VII 140) Finally, he points out that the certainty of clear and distinct ideas does not depend upon God's guarantee (AT VII 145–146). The \"cogito\" in particular is self-verifying, indubitable, immune to the strongest doubt.\n\nBernard Williams presents the memory defense as follows: \"When one is actually intuiting a given proposition, no doubt can be entertained. So any doubt there can be must be entertained when one is not intuiting the proposition.\" (p. 206) He goes on to argue: \"The trouble with Descartes's system is not that it is circular; nor that there is an illegitimate relation between the proofs of God and the clear and distinct perceptions [...] The trouble is that the proofs of God are invalid and do not convince even when they are supposedly being intuited\". (p. 210)\n\nAs Andrea Christofidou explains:\n\"The distinction appropriate here is that between \"cognitio\" and \"scientia\"; both are true and cannot be contradicted, but the latter is \"objectively\" true and certain (with the guarantee of God), while the former is \"subjectively\" true and certain, that is, time-bound, and objectively possible (and does not need the guarantee of God).\" (pp 219–220)\n\nA more interesting defense of Descartes against the charge of circularity is developed by Harry Frankfurt in his book \"Demons, Dreamers, and Madmen: the Defense of Reason in Descartes' Meditations\" (Bobbs–Merrill, 1970; reprinted by Princeton University Press, 2007). Frankfurt suggests that Descartes' arguments for the existence of God, and for the reliability of reason, are not intended to prove that their conclusions are absolutely true, but to show that reason can be compelled to accept them, even in the face of radical skeptical arguments. In fact, according to Frankfurt, the validation of reason is accomplished by the rejection of the main sceptical hypothesis, which is the first real (albeit negative) conclusion of the argument, whilst the proposition about God's existence is a merely preparatory step.\nIt must be conceded that once reached the real conclusion of the argument, the cartesian method would forbid the sceptic to reply that perhaps the cartesian proof was suggested to the meditator by the evil genius itself, in the first place (thereby accusing Descartes of vicious circularity). This accusation fails, since it requires the evil genius' existence to be still deemed (at least) a possibility – an idea which precisely, after the expanded \"God's proof\" the meditator has acquired a specific reason to reject.\n\nHowever, according to Frankfurt the proof presupposes the validity of the principle of non-contradiction, since otherwise an argument leading to the (provisional) conclusion that a benevolent God exists, wouldn't force Descartes to reject the possible existence of the demon. Thus the proof might, after all, beg the question against a kind of skepticism radical enough to put in doubt the rule of non-contradiction.\n\nMoreover, according to Frankfurt's Descartes, the meditator feels forced to accept his conclusion merely because of the evidence of the supporting argument, while Frankfurt himself started by explaining that the radical doubt is meant to be a criticism of evidence as a criterion of truth (even subjective truth, if you want). As Frankfurt pointed out, it seems hard to deny that the general proposition \"evident statements can be false or misleading\" can be thought without hindrance, and that Descartes seems to have countenanced this kind of doubt, when close to the end of the First Meditation he wrote that\n\"...as I sometimes think that others are in error respecting matters of which they believe themselves to possess a perfect knowledge, how do I know that I am not also deceived each time I add together two and three, or number the sides of a square, or form some judgment still more simple, if more simple indeed can be imagined?\"\nThe outcome seems to be that a doubt aimed at evident ideas is supposed by Frankfurt to be overcome by means of a further evident idea, thereby begging the question. Frankfurt's ideas about the cartesian circle are further developed by Edwin Curley and José de Teresa.\n\n\n"}

Oosthuizen\n\nDaniel Charl Stephanus Oosthuizen (also known as Daantjie Oosthuizen) was a South African philosopher, and an early Afrikaner voice against Apartheid. The main direction of his philosophical work lay in the field of epistemology and the philosophy of mind. He was more widely known in South Africa for his moral, political and religious essays, and was described by André Brink as a thorn in the flesh of the establishment. He was a confidant of Beyers Naude, who acknowledged him as having been one of the original group whose discussions and thoughts led to the founding of the Christian Institute of Southern Africa, of which he was both a founder member and a member of the Board of Management. He also contributed to the formation of the University Christian Movement.\n\nOosthuizen was born in Knysna, South Africa, on 15 January 1926, and died in Grahamstown, South Africa, on 4 April 1969.\n\nHe was educated at the Laerskool Pretoria-Oos, the Afrikaanse Hoer Seunskool in Pretoria and the Hoer Volkskool at Graaff-Reinet where he matriculated in the first class in 1942. From 1943 he studied at the University of Stellenbosch and obtained a B.A. in 1945 with distinction in philosophy. In 1947 he passed the M.A. examination in philosophy with a mark of 90%, and in 1949 graduated M.A. cum laude with the thesis \"Die Verklaringsdrang: aestetieseckomiese oorweging i.v.m. die verklaringsfilosofie in die rigting van ’n eksistensiele dialektiek\" (The Urge to Explain: Aesthetic-comical and fragmentary considerations concerning the philosophy of explanation in the direction of an existential dialectic.) Through this he is credited, alongside his contemporaries Johan Degenaar and James Oglethorpe, with introducing the work of the Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard to Stellenbosch. From 1947 he also studied at the Theological Seminary in Stellenbosch, and in 1949 passed the candidate's examination in theology. From 1950 to 1951 he studied for a year under Prof. G.C. Berkouwer at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam. From 1951 to 1955 he did research in philosophy at the University of Amsterdam, and in June 1955 he passed cum laude in the doctoral examination with a study on the phenomenology of Husserl. He spent sabbatical years at Oxford University in 1962, where Gilbert Ryle was his tutor, and again in 1968.\n\nIn 1952 Oosthuizen was married to Ann Schonland, and they had three children.\n\nFrom June 1949 to December 1950 Oosthuizen was junior lecturer in philosophy at the University of Stellenbosch. From 1955 to 1957 he lectured on the history of philosophy, logic and ethics at the University of the Orange Free State. From January 1958 until his death in April 1969 he was Professor of Philosophy at Rhodes University in Grahamstown.\n\nOosthuizen wrote prolifically, presenting his work primarily through public addresses, seminars and lectures.

{"id": "24589706", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24589706", "title": "Deep Green Resistance", "text": "Deep Green Resistance\n\nDeep Green Resistance (DGR) is a radical environmental movement that views mainstream environmental activism as being largely ineffective. DGR is also used by group members to refer to their particular political strategies. The group believes that industrial civilization, as they define it, is endangering all life on the planet and that a broad range of tactics are needed to achieve environmental and social justice. They argue for a radical shift in societal structures and functions.\n\nIn the book \"Deep Green Resistance\", the authors state that civilization, particularly industrial civilization, is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively (and urgently) dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet. Civilization can be defined as the development of agriculture and the growth of cities. Deep Green Resistance argues that agriculture is detrimental to land fertility and cities necessarily surpass the natural carrying capacity of land bases. Civilization relies heavily on industry, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels.\n\nDGR's principles stem from the concept of deep ecology and state that all species are inherently equal, and thus humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Næss, was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!. Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements.\n\nThe movement differentiates itself from bright green environmentalism, which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions, in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large-scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that, lifestyle changes will follow.\n\nThe term was created for a conference entitled \"Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture\" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. Lierre Keith was the main organizer.\n\nDeep Green theory draws on elements of anthropology, phenomenology, deep ecology and ecofeminism.\n\nDerrick Jensen is a prominent member of the Deep Green Resistance Advisory Board. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another board member, is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Stephanie McMillan, and Jack D. Forbes are also prominent influences on the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including Arne Næss, Richard Manning, Andrea Dworkin, Peggy Reeves Sanday, David Abram, Chellis Glendinning, Chris Hedges, Joseph Tainter, Richard Heinberg, Daniel Quinn, Tracie Marie Park (a.k.a. Zoe Blunt) and Jerry Mander, among others.\n\nThe Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all the cultures within globalized civilization, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to sustainability. Members of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical examples of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization, and statistics regarding the current system's unsustainability. DGR maintains that humans must act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse. Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.\n\nWithin the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable. The founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well-intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warn that they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution.\n\nDecisive Ecological Warfare: \nWell-organized underground militants would make coordinated attacks on energy infrastructure around the world … actions against pipelines, power lines, tankers, and refineries, perhaps using electromagnetic pulses. ….\nProponents of Deep Green Resistance encourage strategies for social action that range from violent to non-violent. DGR's support for militant action (described as a potentially necessary means by which to invoke drastic environmental change) is rejected by many pacifists. Some have called this a potential deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism. The strategy described by Jensen, McBay and Keith largely centers around hard-hitting infrastructural sabotage, such as forcible dam removal, rather than any kind of personal violence.\n\nJensen predicts, regarding the movement, that acts of personal violence in the future will be almost completely offensive by those countering the resistance movement (i.e. those currently in power) and self-defensive by those enacting the resistance movement. When asked, \"If we dismantle civilization, won't that kill millions of people in cities? What about them?,\" Jensen has responded that \"No matter what you do, your hands will be blood red... because the global economy is [already] murdering humans and non-humans the planet over...\" and \"As this culture continues to collapse, those who are doing the exploiting will continue... Don’t blame those who want to stop that exploitation. Instead, help to stop the exploitation that is killing people in the first place.\" Jensen has also clarified such ideas on \"Democracy Now!\": \"I get accused of being the 'violence guy'... but I don’t ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response.\"\n\nKeith has discussed in depth the \"complexity of the issue of violence\" in the organization's eponymous book, and how it is \"understandable that people who care about justice want to reject violence; many of us are survivors of it.\" However, she urges the following distinctions, favoring only the second in each dichotomy: \"the violence of hierarchy vs. the violence of self-defense, violence against actual people vs. violence against property, and the [use of] violence as self-actualization vs. the violence of political resistance. It is difficult to find someone who is against all of these.\"\n\nWhile Deep Green Resistance maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement, Keith and McBay have openly encouraged an additional element of underground action, and DGR provides the theoretical and aboveground framework to support such action. The organization's book points to historical examples of resistance movements that relied on an interdependence between aboveground and underground networks in order to accomplish mutual goals.\n\nA book titled \"Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet\" by Aric McBay, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press. The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.\n\nThe organization's official website states that \"DGR strives to be a radical organization in every respect, including our approach to feminist struggles.\" DGR's radical feminism views gender, by definition, as a social system created by patriarchy to coercively and violently control behavior of both males and females; however, within this system, men and masculinity are privileged, while women are trained into subordinated behavior and routinely targeted for institutionalized and socially sanctioned violence due to their sex and/or gender role.\n\nDGR's stance on gender has led some to interpret DGR as transphobic. The controversy especially swelled when a newly transitioning member of DGR, self-identifying as a woman, requested to join a women-only communal sleeping and showering space and, later, a women-only caucus space; the women's caucus discussed the issue collectively and ultimately denied the applicant. A year after this, Aric McBay claimed he \"left the organization at the beginning of 2012 after a trans inclusive policy was cancelled by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith. Many good people and good activists left the organization for that reason. I find these transphobic attitudes to be disgusting and deeply troubling...\" DGR released a note in response to McBay's statement, claiming that McBay actually departed the organization by mutual agreement, after unsuccessfully trying to force Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith from DGR. Keith and Jensen reiterated that the women of DGR made the decision to deny the applicant for themselves. In this statement, DGR also affirmed that \"the right of women to define their own spaces\" is central to how the organization operates.\n\nThe organization has denied these claims, explaining that \"DGR does not condone dehumanization or violence against anyone, including people who describe themselves as trans.\" The website asserts that DGR holds \"a difference of opinion about the definition of gender\" with genderists, and states that \"genderists think gender is an identity, an internal set of feelings people might have. Radical feminists think gender is a caste system.\" DGR's view of gender as a caste system implies that gender is an institution that cannot be improved or remedied, but, rather, requires complete dismantling so that egalitarian, spontaneous, and free behavior can emerge. Because DGR inherently defines gender as \"a brutal and corrupt arrangement of power,\" they want to dismantle the gender system, rather than reform it, celebrate it, or make it more inclusive. DGR, as self-described radical feminists, are \"critical of gender itself. We are not gender reformists—we are gender abolitionists.\"\n\nCritics of Deep Green Resistance have made claims similar to critics of anarcho-primitivism and deep ecology. DGR's ideas have been variously criticized by online publications as polarizing solutions to environmental reform, \"elitist\", \"too radical\", or \"out of step.\" Founder Derrick Jensen, for example, has concluded in his earlier work \"Endgame\" that \"The mass of civilized people will never be on our side.” This has led to the criticism of organizing a strategy that is pessimistic about popular involvement, and therefore aims at forcing change without the majority's consensus. Some critics have, therefore, argued that \"radical tactics tend to be counterproductive to the goal of increasing awareness and concern in the general public.\"\n\nOpponents of Deep Green Resistance further claim that DGR, which predicts massive numbers of human deaths during the forthcoming \"crash\" of civilization, does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle in seeking to accelerate this crash. Keith and Jensen have both acknowledged this unpleasant reality; however, they have repeatedly claimed that the crash is inevitable (and will only result in more suffering the longer it is delayed) and that they are merely warning of—and trying to prepare the world for—these forthcoming deaths and possible wide-scale violence. Jensen has stated that if activists do not wish to participate in the physical work of accelerating this crash, they, at the very least, should locally prepare and \"set up committees to eliminate or, if appropriate, channel the (additional) violence that might break out.\"\n\nAnarchists who believe that all hierarchically structured relations, whatever the purpose, are oppressive, disagree with DGR's promotion of the use of hierarchical organization within any underground. McBay and Keith have both promoted the idea of underground networks organized along hierarchical lines. Keith has advocated for a disciplined \"command structure\" regarding frontline activists. McBay, in \"Deep Green Resistance\", has argued that hierarchies are an efficient means of organizing underground resistance.\n\nAnarchist writers—among them anarcho-primitivists like John Zerzan and Kevin Tucker—have criticized DGR's Code of Conduct, their historical understanding of revolution and radical history, and the perceived \"cult of personality\" around Jensen and Keith.\n\n\n"}

Divine laws are typically regarded as superior to man-made laws, sometimes due to an understanding that their source has resources beyond human knowledge and human reason. They are accorded greater authority, and cannot be changed by human authorities.\n\nDivine laws are noted for their inflexibility. Divine laws are often understood as beyond the authority of humans to change. The introduction of interpretation into divine law is a controversial issue, since believers place high significance on adhering to the law precisely. Opponents to the application of divine law typically deny that it is purely divine and point out human influences in the law. This element of human influence is understood as incorporating some degree of fallibility. These opponents characterize such laws as belonging to a particular cultural tradition. Adherents of divine law, on the other hand, are sometimes reluctant to adapt divine laws to cultural contexts.\n\nDivine law may be transmitted through several mediums. Most frequently, that are transmitted through religious texts. Medieval Christianity understood there to be three kinds of laws: divine law, natural law, and man-made law. Others, on the other hand, understand natural law as a subset of divine law delivered through general revelation from a creator deity. Theologians have substantially debated the scope of natural law, with the Enlightenment encouraging greater use of reason and expanding the scope of natural law and marginalizing divine law in a process of secularization. Some people may understand themselves as receiving guidance through prayer or conscience, although the moral authority of these methods of transmission are much lower.\n\nSince the authority of divine law is rooted in its source, the origin and transmission history of divine law are important.\n\nThere are frequently conflicts between secular understandings of justice or morality and divine law.\n\nReligious law, such as canon law, includes both divine law and additional interpretations, logical extensions, and traditions.\n\nIn Thomas Aquinas's \"Treatise on Law\", divine law comes only from revelation or scripture, hence biblical law, and is necessary for human salvation. According to Aquinas, divine law must not be confused with natural law. Divine law is mainly and mostly natural law, but it can also be positive law.\n\n\n"}

If a typical individual in such a group is selected at random, it is not likely that this person will profit from such a group ethic.\n\nSome individuals might profit, in a material sense, from a philosophy of greed, but it is believed by proponents of enlightened self-interest that these individuals constitute a small minority and that the large majority of persons can expect to experience a net personal loss from a philosophy of simple \"unenlightened\" selfishness. \n\nUnenlightened self-interest can result in the tragedy of the commons.\n\nEnlightened self-interest is related to the Golden Rule: simply acting toward all others the way one wants them to act toward oneself. The reasoning, for example, is \"I will not steal because if I steal then others may steal from me and the creation of a thieving society will likely hurt me\".\n\nEnlightened self-interest also has implications for long-term benefits as opposed to short-term benefits to oneself. When an individual pursues enlightened self-interest that person may sacrifice short-term interests to maximize long-term interests. This is a form of deferred gratification. \n\nAn individual may choose to forsake pursuing immediate gratification by supporting and not interfering with others' pursuit of self-interest. An individual may have to sacrifice his immediate self-interest for the purpose of a positive relationship to a group of individuals to which he relates. For example, a merchant likely will maximize profit over the long term if they choose to be generous to their customers in a manner beyond the requirement of policy, say, in accepting returns and refunding the purchase price when not required to by explicit policy. By doing so, they may lose short-term gain but likely will eventually profit from increased business volume as they gain a reputation for being reasonable, honest, and generous.\n\nEnlightened self-interest is also different from altruism, which calls for people to act in the interest of others often at the expense of their own interests and with no expectation of material benefit for themselves in the future. Some advocates of enlightened self-interest might argue that pure altruism promotes inefficiency as well.\n\nD'Souza and Adams argue that though altruism generally comes from good intentions, the outcomes of altruism might not always be good for humanity from the consequentialist standpoint. They claim that without high objectivity, consideration for the global community, and sound knowledge of the probable consequences of the altruistic act, the act is unenlightened.\n\nEnlightened self-interest is also different from Rational selfishness, a term generally related to Ayn Rand's Objectivist philosophy, which refers to a person's efforts to look after their own well-being, to cultivate the self, and achieve goals for the good of the self. The focus in rational selfishness might be considered to be more self-directed (where the benefit to the group or society is a possible by-product) than the focus of enlightened self-interest which is more group-directed (and the benefit to oneself might be more of the by-product). Some authors say that this concept elevates egoism to the level of a moral principle.\n\n"}

This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed. This problem centers on what Mandelbaum (1962) termed the \"self-excepting fallacy.\" Largely because of the self-excepting fallacy, few authors in the philosophy of science currently accept aletheic cognitive relativism. Factual relativism (also called epistemic relativism, epistemological relativism, alethic relativism or cognitive relativism) is a way to reason where facts used to justify any claims are understood to be relative and subjective to the perspective of those proving or falsifying the proposition.\n\nOne school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, Paul Feyerabend's comments in \"Against Method\" that \"The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing\" and \"First-world science is one science among many\" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition) are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously.\n\nThe strong program in the sociology of science is (in the words of founder David Bloor) \"impartial with respect to truth and falsity\". Elsewhere, Bloor and Barry Barnes have said \"For the relativist [such as us] there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such.\" In France, Bruno Latour has claimed that \"Since the settlement of a controversy is the \"cause\" of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome – Nature – to explain how and why a controversy has been settled.\"\n\nYves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper \"Le Soir\" that \"There is no transcendent truth. [...] It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does.\"\n\nThe philosopher of science Gérard Fourez wrote in that \"What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question.\"\n\nBritish archaeologist Roger Anyon told \"The New York Times\" that \"science is just one of many ways of knowing the world... The Zuni's world view is just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about.\"\n\nCognitive relativism is unfalsifiable and has been criticized by both analytic philosophers and scientists.\n\nCosmologist Stephen Hawking in \"The Grand Design\" has advocated model-dependent realism, which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of M-Theory.\n\nLarry Laudan's book \"Science and Relativism\" outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.\n\n\n\n"}

The debate compares and evaluates the central ideas of Habermas and Foucault as they pertain to questions of power, reason, ethics, modernity, democracy, civil society, and social action.\n\nThe debate was a dialogue between texts and followers; Foucault and Habermas did not actually debate in person, though they were considering a formal one in the U.S. before Foucault's death in 1984. Habermas' essay, \"Taking Aim at the Heart of the Present\" (1984) was altered before release in order to account for Foucault's inability to reply.\n\nNancy Fraser's contentious, but oft-quoted, claim that Foucault's work is a mixture of \"empirical insights and normative confusions\" exemplifies the most common strategy of critique by those favouring Habermas. It attempts to demonstrate the incoherence of Foucault's practice of critical reflection while at the same time appropriating those aspects considered valuable. Demonstrating this incoherence is necessary from the Habermas position since he sought to establish \"the\" form of critical reflection, whereas Foucault sought to establish only \"a\" form of critical reflection.\n\nIn response, many of Foucault's advocates argue the Habermasian critique presupposes what it seeks to show and that the critique is based on a misunderstanding of Foucault's work. In 1999, Ashenden and Owen published an edited volume of papers entitled \"Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory\" in an attempt to re-engage the debate and shift the dialogue to new ground. Specifically, they aimed to 1) illuminate the stakes of the encounter between the different practices of critical reflection, 2) evaluate some major criticisms of genealogy made in the course of the debate, and 3) offer a critical response to Habermas' position from the perspective of Foucault's practice in relation to contemporary political-philosophical and political issues.\n\nThe publication of Foucault's Collège de France lectures over the past decade has also served to recast the Foucault–Habermas debate since the Ashenden and Owen volume. The lectures on biopolitics and governmentality, as well as Foucault's relation to Kant and neoliberalism has resulted in a number of scholars revisiting questions over normativity, resistance and critique in Foucault's work.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "15532763", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=15532763", "title": "Gay pride", "text": "Gay pride\n\nGay pride or LGBT pride is the positive stance against discrimination and violence toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people to promote their self-affirmation, dignity, equality rights, increase their visibility as a social group, build community, and celebrate sexual diversity and gender variance. Pride, as opposed to shame and social stigma, is the predominant outlook that bolsters most LGBT rights movements throughout the world. Pride has lent its name to LGBT-themed organizations, institutes, foundations, book titles, periodicals and even a cable TV station and the Pride Library.\n\nRanging from solemn to carnivalesque, pride events are typically held during LGBT Pride Month or some other period that commemorates a turning point in a country's LGBT history, for example Moscow Pride in May for the anniversary of Russia's 1993 decriminalization of homosexuality. Some pride events include LGBT pride parades and marches, rallies, commemorations, community days, dance parties, and large festivals, such as Sydney Mardi Gras, which spans several weeks.\n\nCommon symbols of pride are the rainbow or pride flag, the lowercase Greek letter lambda (λ), the pink triangle and the black triangle, these latter two reclaimed from use as badges of shame in Nazi concentration camps.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s in the United States was an extremely repressive legal and social period for LGBT people. In this context American homophile organizations such as the Daughters of Bilitis and the Mattachine Society coordinated some of the earliest demonstrations of the modern LGBT rights movement. These two organizations in particular carried out pickets called \"Annual Reminders\" to inform and remind Americans that LGBT people did not receive basic civil rights protections. Annual Reminders began in 1965 and took place each July 4 at Independence Hall in Philadelphia.\n\nThe anti-LGBT discourse of these times equated both male and female homosexuality with mental illness. Inspired by Stokely Carmichael's \"Black is Beautiful\", Gay civil rights pioneer and participant in the Annual Reminders Frank Kameny originated the slogan \"Gay is Good\" in 1968 to counter social stigma and personal feelings of guilt and shame.\n\nEarly on the morning of Saturday, June 28, 1969, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning persons rioted following a police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar at 43 Christopher Street, New York City. This riot and further protests and rioting over the following nights were the watershed moment in modern LGBT rights movement and the impetus for organizing LGBT pride marches on a much larger public scale.\n\nOn November 2, 1969, Craig Rodwell, his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, and Linda Rhodes proposed the first pride march to be held in New York City by way of a resolution at the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) meeting in Philadelphia.\n\"That the Annual Reminder, in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged—that of our fundamental human rights—be moved both in time and location.\n\n<br>We propose that a demonstration be held annually on the last Saturday in June in New York City to commemorate the 1969 spontaneous demonstrations on Christopher Street and this demonstration be called CHRISTOPHER STREET LIBERATION DAY. No dress or age regulations shall be made for this demonstration.\n\n<br>We also propose that we contact Homophile organizations throughout the country and suggest that they hold parallel demonstrations on that day. We propose a nationwide show of support.\n\nAll attendees to the ERCHO meeting in Philadelphia voted for the march except for Mattachine Society of New York, which abstained. Members of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) attended the meeting and were seated as guests of Rodwell's group, Homophile Youth Movement in Neighborhoods (HYMN).\n\nMeetings to organize the march began in early January at Rodwell's apartment in 350 Bleecker Street. At first there was difficulty getting some of the major New York City organizations like Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) to send representatives. Craig Rodwell and his partner Fred Sargeant, Ellen Broidy, Michael Brown, Marty Nixon, and Foster Gunnison of Mattachine made up the core group of the CSLD Umbrella Committee (CSLDUC). For initial funding, Gunnison served as treasurer and sought donations from the national homophile organizations and sponsors, while Sargeant solicited donations via the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop customer mailing list and Nixon worked to gain financial support from GLF in his position as treasurer for that organization. Other mainstays of the organizing committee were Judy Miller, Jack Waluska, Steve Gerrie and Brenda Howard of GLF. Believing that more people would turn out for the march on a Sunday, and so as to mark the date of the start of the Stonewall uprising, the CSLDUC scheduled the date for the first march for Sunday, June 28, 1970. With Dick Leitsch's replacement as president of Mattachine NY by Michael Kotis in April 1970, opposition to the march by Mattachine ended.\n\nBrenda Howard is known as the \"Mother of Pride\" for her work in coordinating the march. Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June. Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT Activists Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \"Pride\" to describe these festivities. As LGBT rights activist Tom Limoncelli put it, \"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\"\nChristopher Street Liberation Day on June 28, 1970 marked the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots with an assembly on Christopher Street and the first Gay Pride march in U.S. history, covering the 51 blocks to Central Park. The march took less than half the scheduled time due to excitement, but also due to wariness about walking through the city with gay banners and signs. Although the parade permit was delivered only two hours before the start of the march, the marchers encountered little resistance from onlookers. \"The New York Times\" reported (on the front page) that the marchers took up the entire street for about 15 city blocks. Reporting by \"The Village Voice\" was positive, describing \"the out-front resistance that grew out of the police raid on the Stonewall Inn one year ago\".\n\nOn the same weekend gay activist groups on the West Coast of the United States held a march in Los Angeles and a march and \"Gay-in\" in San Francisco.\n\nOne day earlier, on Saturday, June 27, 1970, Chicago Gay Liberation organized a march from Washington Square Park (\"Bughouse Square\") to the Water Tower at the intersection of Michigan and Chicago avenues, which was the route originally planned, and then many of the participants extemporaneously marched on to the Civic Center (now Richard J. Daley) Plaza. The date was chosen because the Stonewall events began on the last Saturday of June and because organizers wanted to reach the maximum number of Michigan Avenue shoppers. Subsequent Chicago parades have been held on the last Sunday of June, coinciding with the date of many similar parades elsewhere.\n\nThe next year, Gay Pride marches took place in Boston, Dallas, Milwaukee, London, Paris, West Berlin, and Stockholm. By 1972 the participating cities included Atlanta, Brighton, Buffalo, Detroit, Washington D.C., Miami, and Philadelphia, as well as San Francisco.\n\nFrank Kameny soon realized the pivotal change brought by the Stonewall riots. An organizer of gay activism in the 1950s, he was used to persuasion, trying to convince heterosexuals that gay people were no different than they were. When he and other people marched in front of the White House, the State Department and Independence Hall only five years earlier, their objective was to look as if they could work for the U.S. government. Ten people marched with Kameny then, and they alerted no press to their intentions. Although he was stunned by the upheaval by participants in the Annual Reminder in 1969, he later observed, \"By the time of Stonewall, we had fifty to sixty gay groups in the country. A year later there was at least fifteen hundred. By two years later, to the extent that a count could be made, it was twenty-five hundred.\"\n\nSimilar to Kameny's regret at his own reaction to the shift in attitudes after the riots, Randy Wicker came to describe his embarrassment as \"one of the greatest mistakes of his life\". The image of gays retaliating against police, after so many years of allowing such treatment to go unchallenged, \"stirred an unexpected spirit among many homosexuals\". Kay Lahusen, who photographed the marches in 1965, stated, \"Up to 1969, this movement was generally called the homosexual or homophile movement... Many new activists consider the Stonewall uprising the birth of the gay liberation movement. Certainly it was the birth of gay pride on a massive scale.\"\n\nIn the 1980s there was a major cultural shift in the Stonewall Riot commemorations. The previous loosely organized, grassroots marches and parades were taken over by more organized and less radical elements of the gay community. The marches began dropping \"Liberation\" and \"Freedom\" from their names under pressure from more conservative members of the community, replacing them with the philosophy of \"Gay Pride\" (in the more liberal San Francisco, the name of the gay parade and celebration was not changed from \"Gay Freedom Day Parade\" to \"Gay Pride Day Parade\" until 1994). The Greek lambda symbol and the pink triangle, which had been revolutionary symbols of the Gay Liberation Movement, were tidied up and incorporated into the Gay Pride, or Pride, movement, providing some symbolic continuity with its more radical beginnings. The pink triangle was also the inspiration for the homomonument in Amsterdam, commemorating all gay men and lesbians who have been subjected to persecution because of their homosexuality.\n\nThe month of June was chosen for LGBT Pride Month to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred at the end of June 1969. As a result, many pride events are held during this month to recognize the impact LGBT people have had in the world. Brenda Howard is known as the \"Mother of Pride\", for her work in coordinating the first LGBT Pride march, and she also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around Pride Day which became the genesis of the annual LGBT Pride celebrations that are now held around the world every June. Additionally, Howard along with fellow LGBT rights activists Robert A. Martin (aka Donny the Punk) and L. Craig Schoonmaker are credited with popularizing the word \"Pride\" to describe these festivities. As LGBT rights activist Tom Limoncelli put it, \"The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named Brenda Howard thought it should be.'\"\nOn several occasions, the President of the United States has officially declared a Pride Month. First, President Bill Clinton declared June \"Gay & Lesbian Pride Month\" on June 11, 1999 and in 2000. Then, in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, President Barack Obama declared June LGBT Pride Month.\n\nBeginning in 2012, Google displayed some LGBT-related search results with different rainbow-colored patterns each year during June. In 2017, Google also included rainbow coloured streets on Google Maps to display Gay Pride marches occurring across the world.\n\nFrom both outside and inside the LGBT community, there is criticism and protest against pride events. Bob Christie's documentary \"\" evaluates gay pride events in different countries within the context of local opposition.\n\nIn August 2011, Sao Paulo city alderman of the right-wing Democrats Party sponsored a bill to organize and sponsor \"Heterosexual Pride Day\" on the third Sunday of December. The bill was passed by the city council, and awaits the signature of mayor Gilberto Kassab. Apolinário, an Evangelical Protestant, stated that the intent of the parade was a \"struggle ... against excesses and privileges\". Members of Grupo Gay da Bahia and the Workers' Party criticized the bill as enhancing \"the possibility of discrimination and prejudice\". However, no events have ever been held.\n\nA Brazilian photographer was arrested after refusing to delete photos of police attacking two young people participating in a gay pride parade on October 16, 2011 in the city of Itabuna, Bahia, reported the newspaper Correio 24 horas.\n\nAccording to the website Notícias de Ipiau, Ederivaldo Benedito, known as Bené, said four police officers tried to convince him to delete the photos soon after they realized they were being photographed. When he refused, they ordered him to turn over the camera. When the photographer refused again, the police charged him with contempt and held him in jail for over 21 hours until he gave a statement.\n\nAccording to Chief Marlon Macedo, the police alleged that the photographer was interfering with their work, did not have identification, and became aggressive when he was asked to move. Bené denied the allegations, saying the police were belligerent and that the scene was witnessed by \"over 300 people\", reported Agência Estado.\n\nIn a 2008 interview for the biography book \"La Reina muy cerca\" (The Queen Up Close) by Spanish journalist and writer Pilar Urbano, Queen Sofía of Spain sparked off controversy by voicing her disapproval of LGBT pride in addition to overstepping her official duties as a member of the Royal Family by censuring the Spanish Law on Marriage in how it names equal same-sex unions \"matrimonio\" (marriage). Albeit without using the slogan \"Straight Pride\", Queen Sofía was directly quoted as saying that if heterosexuals were to take the streets as the LGBT community does for Gay Pride parades, that the former collective would bring Madrid to a standstill.\n\nEven though the Royal Household of Spain approved publication of the interview and Pilar Urbano offered to share the interview recording, both Queen Sofía and the Royal Household have refuted the comments in question.\n\nIn 2015 police dispersed the LGBT Pride Parade using tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nIn 2016 and 2017 Istanbul Governor's Office didn't allow the LGBT Pride Parade, citing security concerns and public order.\n\nIn 2016, Ugandan police broke up a gay pride event in the capital. Homosexual acts are illegal in Uganda.\n\nIn a special queer issue of \"The Stranger\" in 1999, openly gay author, pundit, and journalist Dan Savage questioned the relevance of pride thirty years later, writing that pride was an effective antidote to shame imposed on LGBT people, but that pride is now making LGBT people dull and slow as a group, as well as being a constant reminder of shame. However, he also states that pride in some simpler forms are still useful to individuals struggling with shame. Savage writes that gay pride can also lead to disillusionment where an LGBT individual realises the reality that sexual orientation doesn't say much about a person's personality, after being led by the illusion that LGBT individuals are part of a co-supportive and inherently good group of people.\n\nThe growth and commercialization of Christopher Street Days, coupled with their de-politicalisation, has led to an alternative CSD in Berlin, the so-called \"Kreuzberger CSD\" or \"Transgenialer\" (\"Transgenial\"/Trans Ingenious\") CSD. Political party members are not invited for speeches, nor can parties or companies sponsor floats. After the parade there is a festival with a stage for political speakers and entertainers. Groups discuss lesbian/transsexual/transgender/gay or queer perspectives on issues such as poverty and unemployment benefits (Hartz IV), gentrification, or \"Fortress Europe\".\n\nIn June 2010, American philosopher and theorist Judith Butler refused the Civil Courage Award (Zivilcouragepreis) of the Christopher Street Day Parade in Berlin, Germany at the award ceremony, arguing and lamenting in a speech that the parade had become too commercial, and was ignoring the problems of racism and the double discrimination facing homosexual or transsexual migrants. According to Butler, even the organizers themselves promote racism. The general manager of the CSD committee, Robert Kastl, countered Butler's allegations and pointed out that the organizers already awarded a counselling center for lesbians dealing with double discrimination in 2006. Regarding the allegations of commercialism Kastl explained further that the CSD organizers don't require small groups to pay a participation fee which starts at 50 € and goes up to 1500 €. He also distanced himself from all forms of racism and islamophobia.\n\nA number of associations and social movements have been denouncing in recent years which, in its views, is a depletion of the claims of these demonstrations and the \"merchandization\" of the parade. In this respect, they defend, in countries like Spain, the United States or Canada, a \"Critical Pride\" celebration to have a political meaning again. Gay Shame, a radical movement within the LGBT community, opposes the assimilation of LGBT people into mainstream, heteronormative society, the commodification of non-heterosexual identity and culture, and in particular the (over) commercialization of pride events.\n\n\"Straight Pride\" and \"Heterosexual Pride\" are analogies and slogans that oppose heterosexuality to homosexuality by copying the phrase \"Gay Pride\". Originating from the Culture Wars in the United States, \"Straight Pride\" is a form of conservative backlash as there is no straight or heterosexual civil rights movement. While criticism from inside and outside the LGBT community abounds, the \"Straight Pride\" incidents have, however, gained some media attention especially when they involve government and public institutions.\n\n\n"}

He is a full professor and academic director of the Advanced Master in Media Management at ESCP Europe, and a program director at the Collège International de Philosophie (CIPh).\n\nHe received the EFMD-FNEGE Best Essay Award in 2015.\n\nAt ESCP Europe, he is a member of the Social Sciences and Humanities department and he is best known as the academic director of the advanced Media Management program since 1997, a pioneer in Europe in the domain of media economics and management created ten years before. With the help of a sponsoring committee made up of professionals such as Jean Drucker, Jacques Rigaud and Daniel Toscan du Plantier, the pedagogical content has focused on editorial transformations and economic changes in both new and traditional media.\n\nHe has occupied various senior positions in the media and digital industries from 1994 until 2007, when he sold a news publishing company that he had run four years before deciding to devote himself full-time to academia.\n\nHe is also an Editorial Board member of Business and Professional Ethics Journal (BPEJ) and of International Journal on Media Management (JMM) since 2010.\n\nHis research has contributed to the consolidation of a European orientation, especially through his involvement at EMMA, to media organization studies. His initial work presents media management less as a new academic discipline than as a multi-paradigm field of research that challenges the universalist approaches to management science.\n\nIn such a \"sector studies\" approach, management is inconceivable without a plurality of disciplines, particularly the social sciences and humanities, which bring their theoretical and methodological contributions to a better understanding of the agents and of the structures. From the model suggested by Küng, management in media activities cannot avoid a \"contextualist\" approach to study the media in their constantly changing historical, sociological and economic specificities, and \"pluralistic\", i.e. recognizing the complexity of specific media organizations at the editorial, political and identity levels.\n\nScientific management claims to be axiologically neutral. In Management Ethique (2012), he shows instead that managerial practice includes ethical and political questions not only at the meso (the organization) and macro (societal and environmental) but also at the micro level (relation to oneself and to others).\n\nDrawing on various sources of European continental philosophy his work highlights, beyond the efforts of the traditional stream of research in business ethics, the fact that ethics cannot be taught or understood as any other management \"knowledge\". The notion of protomanagement, as one can conceive it through discussion between Socrates and Ischomachus in Xenophon’s Economics is then reactivated. In the Ancient Greece, \"Protomanagement\" is first conceived as a political art inseparable from a form of virtue; the ancient \"Mesnager\" is that dedicated to mastering his/her self -Sophrosyne- and concern for the society as a whole.\n\nAt the International College of Philosophy, he develops a research program which aims to extend the efforts made by critical and phenomenological researchers in order to discuss the commonly-held epistemic and political aspects of modern management. The program emphasizes \"the crisis of the foundations faced by management science in its ethical/philosophical aims\". A crisis that can be defined as \"desaffectio societatis\", and which seems to touch the managers themselves more and more.\n\nThe program aims to develop some new ontological and aesthetic approaches to the administration of \"business\", suggesting a new definition of management expressed as \"a vulnerable force, under pressure to achieve results and endowed with the triple power of constraint, imitation and imagination, operating on subjective, interpersonal, institutional and environmental levels\".\n\nFrom an interpretation of Blaise Pascal and Paul Ricoeur’s analysis of power, he builds new concepts around the question of managerial responsibility, rethinking the usual way of considering management-as-practice: practical wisdom, skeptical humanism or \"double thought\".\n\nThen he looks at the necessary conditions for joy at work, following different routes: the first is based on the radical phenomenology of Michel Henry which allows him to pay attention to the impetus of life at work in relation to subjectivity, a little discussed theme in the management literature. The second one concerns field of leadership where power cannot be separated from a dialectic of abilities and disabilities. This approach is at the root of several contributions about the strategic \"vision\" and gender issues using the works of Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze, developments about \"blended leadership\" in the media, and about the beau geste as a critical behavior in organizations.\n\n\n\n"}

Along with hospitality and courage/bravery, it is one of the Bedouin aspects of ethics. Bedouin systems of justice are based on these honor codes, although the codes are falling into disuse as more Bedouins accept sharia or national penal codes as the means for dispensing justice.\n\n\"Ird\" is the Bedouin honor code for women. A woman is born with her \"ird\" intact, but sexual transgression can take her \"ird\" away. It is different from virginity, as it is emotional and conceptual. Once lost, \"ird\" cannot be regained. \n\n\"Sharaf\" is the general Bedouin honor code for men. It can be acquired, augmented, lost, and regained. \"Sharaf\" involves protection of the \"ird\" of the women of the family, protection of property, and maintenance of the honor of the tribe and protection of the village (if the tribe has settled).\n\nDiyafa (hospitality) is a virtue closely linked to \"sharaf\". If required, even an enemy must be given shelter and fed for some days. Poverty does not exempt one from one's duties in this regard. Generosity is a related virtue, and in many Bedouin societies, gifts must be offered and cannot be declined. The destitute are looked after by the community, and tithing is mandatory in many Bedouin societies.\n\nHamasa (courage/bravery) is also closely linked to \"sharaf\". Bravery indicates the willingness to defend one's tribe for the purpose of aṣabīya (tribal solidarity and balance). It is closely related to muruwa (manliness). It usually entails the ability to withstand pain, including (male) circumcision.\n\n"}
{"id": "327636", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=327636", "title": "Infidelity", "text": "Infidelity\n\nInfidelity (synonyms include: cheating, adultery (when married), being unfaithful, or having an affair) is a violation of a couple's assumed or stated contract regarding emotional and/or sexual exclusivity. Other scholars define infidelity as a violation according to the subjective feeling that one's partner has violated a set of rules or relationship norms; this violation results in feelings of sexual jealousy and rivalry.\n\nWhat constitutes an act of infidelity depends upon the exclusivity expectations within the relationship. In marital relationships, exclusivity expectations are commonly assumed, although they are not always met. When they are not met, research has found that psychological damage can occur, including feelings of rage and betrayal, lowering of sexual and personal confidence, and damage to self-image. Depending on the context, men and women can experience social consequences if their act of infidelity becomes public. The form and extent of these consequences are often dependent on the gender of the unfaithful person.\n\nOne measure of infidelity among couples is the frequency of children secretly conceived with a different partner, leading to \"non-paternities\". Such covertly illegitimate children amount to about 1–2% of newborns in studied populations.\n\nAfter the Kinsey Reports came out in the early 1950s, findings suggested that historically and cross-culturally, extramarital sex has been a matter of regulation more than sex before marriage. The Kinsey Reports found that around half of men and a quarter of women studied had committed adultery. The \"Janus Report on Sexual Behavior in America\" also reported that one third of married men and a quarter of women have had an extramarital affair.\n\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", the most consistent data on infidelity comes from the University of Chicago's General Social Survey (GSS). Interviews with people in non-monogamous relationships since 1972 by the GSS have shown that approximately 12% of men and 7% of women admit to having had an extramarital relationship. Results, however, vary year by year, and also by age-group surveyed. For example, one study conducted by the University of Washington, Seattle found slightly, or significantly higher rates of infidelity for populations under 35, or older than 60. In that study which involved 19,065 people during a 15-year period, rates of infidelity among men were found to have risen from 20 to 28%, and rates for women, 5% to 15%. In more recent nationwide surveys, several researchers found that about twice as many men as women reported having an extramarital affair. A survey conducted in 1990 found 2.2% of married participants reported having more than one partner during the past year. In general, national surveys conducted in the early 1990s reported that between 15–25% of married Americans reported having extramarital affairs. People who had stronger sexual interests, more permissive sexual values, lower subjective satisfaction with their partner, weaker network ties to their partner, and greater sexual opportunities were more likely to be unfaithful. Studies suggest around 30–40% of unmarried relationships and 18–20% of marriages see at least one incident of sexual infidelity.\n\nRates of infidelity among women are thought to increase with age. In one study, rates were higher in more recent marriages, compared with previous generations; men were found to be only \"somewhat\" more likely than women to engage in infidelity, with rates for both sexes becoming increasingly similar. Another study found that the likelihood for women to be involved in infidelity reached a peak in the seventh year of their marriage and then declined afterwards; whereas for married men, the longer they were in relationships, the less likely they were to engage in infidelity, except for the eighteenth year of marriage, at which point the chance that men will engage in infidelity increases.\n\nOne measure of infidelity is covert illegitimacy, a situation which arises when someone who is presumed to be a child's father (or mother) is in fact not the biological parent. Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an informal remark at a 1972 conference. The detection of unsuspected illegitimacy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing. Such studies show that covert illegitimacy is in fact less than 10% among the sampled African populations, less than 5% among the sampled Native American and Polynesian populations, less than 2% of the sampled Middle Eastern population, and generally 1–2% among European samples.\n\nStrategic pluralism is a theory that focuses on how environmental factors influence mating strategies. According to this theory, when people live within environments that are demanding and stressful, the need for bi-parental care is greater for increasing the survival of offspring. Correspondingly, monogamy and commitment are more commonplace. On the other hand, when people live within environments that encompass little stress and threats to the viability of offspring, the need for serious and committed relations is lowered, and therefore promiscuity and infidelity are more common.\n\nSex-ratio theory is a theory that explains the relationship and sexual dynamics within different areas of the world based on the ratio of the number of marriage-aged men to marriage-aged women. According to this theory, an area has a high sex ratio when there is a higher number of marriage-aged women to marriage-aged men and an area has a low sex ratio when there are more marriage-aged men. In terms of infidelity, the theory states that when sex-ratios are high, men are more likely to be promiscuous and engage in sex outside of a committed relationship because the demand for men is higher and this type of behaviour, desired by men, is more accepted. On the other hand, when sex ratios are low, promiscuity is less common because women are in demand and since they desire monogamy and commitment, in order for men to remain competitive in the pool of mates, they must respond to these desires. Support for this theory comes from evidence showing higher divorce rates in countries with higher sex ratios and higher monogamy rates in countries with lower sex ratios.\n\nDifferences in sexual infidelity as a function of gender have been commonly reported. It is more common for men compared to women to engage in extradyadic relationships. The National Health and Social Life Survey found that 4% of married men, 16% of cohabiting men, and 37% of dating men engaged in acts of sexual infidelity compared to 1% of married women, 8% of cohabiting women, and 17% of women in dating relationships. These differences have been generally thought due to evolutionary pressures that motivate men towards sexual opportunity and women towards commitment to one partner. In addition, recent research finds that differences in gender may possibly be explained by other mechanisms including power and sensations seeking. For example, one study found that some women in more financially independent and higher positions of power, were also more likely to be more unfaithful to their partners. In another study, when the tendency to sensation seek (i.e., engage in risky behaviours) was controlled for, there were no gender differences in the likelihood to being unfaithful. These findings suggest there may be various factors that might influence the likelihood of some individuals to engage in extradyadic relationships, and that such factors may account for observed gender differences beyond actual gender and evolutionary pressures associated with each.\n\nThere is currently debate in the field of evolutionary psychology whether an innate, evolved sex difference exists between men and women in response to an act of infidelity; this is often called a \"sex difference\". A study published in 2002 suggested there may be sex differences in jealousy. Those that posit a sex difference exists state that men are 60% more likely to be disturbed by an act of sexual infidelity (having one's partner engage in sexual relations with another), whereas women are 83% more likely to be disturbed by an act of emotional infidelity (having one's partner fall in love with another). Those against this model argue that there is no difference between men and women in their response to an act of infidelity. From an evolutionary perspective, men are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as little as possible in their offspring and producing as many offspring as possible, due to the risk of males investing in children that are not theirs. Women, who do not face the risk of cuckoldry, are theorized to maximize their fitness by investing as much as possible in their offspring because they invest at least nine months of resources towards their offspring in pregnancy. Maximizing female fitness is theorized to require males in the relationship to invest all their resources in the offspring. These conflicting strategies are theorized to have resulted in selection of different jealousy mechanisms that are designed to enhance the fitness of the respective gender.\n\nA common way to test whether an innate jealousy response exists between sexes is to use a forced-choice questionnaire. This style of questionnaire asks participants \"yes or no\" and \"response A or response B\" style questions about certain scenarios. For example, a question might ask, \"If you found your partner cheating on you would you be more upset by (A) the sexual involvement or (B) the emotional involvement\". Many studies using forced choice questionnaires have found statistically significant results supporting an innate sex difference between men and women. Furthermore, studies have shown that this observation holds across many cultures, although the magnitudes of the sex difference vary within sexes across cultures.\n\nAlthough forced-choice questionnaires show a statistically significant sex-difference, critics of the theory of evolved sex differences in jealousy question these findings. In consideration of the entire body of work on sex differences, C. F. Harris asserted that when methods other than forced-choice questionnaires are used to identify an innate sex difference, inconsistencies between studies begin to arise. For example, researchers found that women sometimes report feeling more intense jealousy in response to both sexual and emotional infidelity. The results of these studies also depended on the context in which the participants were made to describe what type of jealousy they felt, as well as the intensity of their jealousy.\n\nIn her meta-analysis, Harris raises the question of whether forced choice questionnaires actually measure what they purport: jealousy itself and evidence that differences in jealousy arise from innate mechanisms. Her meta-analysis reveals that sex-differences are almost exclusively found in forced-choice studies. According to Harris, a meta-analysis of multiple types of studies should indicate a convergence of evidence and multiple operationalizations. This is not the case, which raises the question as to the validity of forced-choice studies. DeSteno and Bartlett (2002) further support this argument by providing evidence which indicates that significant results of forced-choice studies may actually be an artifact of measurement; this finding would invalidate many of the claims made by those \"in favor\" of an \"innate\" sex difference. Even those \"in favor\" of sex-differences admit that certain lines of research, such as homicide studies, suggest against the possibility of sex-differences.\n\nThese inconsistent results have led researchers to propose novel theories that attempt to explain the sex differences observed in certain studies. One theory that has been hypothesized to explain why men and women both report more distress to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity is borrowed from childhood attachment theories. Studies have found that attachment styles of adults are consistent with their self-reported relationship histories. For example, more men are reported to have an insecure, dismissing avoidant attachment style; where these \"individuals often attempt to minimize or constrict emotional experience, deny needs for intimacy, are highly invested in autonomy, and are more sexually promiscuous than individuals who have other attachment styles\". Levy and Kelly (2010) tested this theory and found that adult attachment styles strongly correlate to which type of infidelity elicited more jealousy. Individuals who have secure attachment styles often report that emotional infidelity is more upsetting whereas dismissing attachment styles were more likely to find sexual infidelity more upsetting. Their study did report that men in general were more likely than women to report sexual infidelity as more distressing, however this could be related to more men having a dismissing attachment style.The authors propose that a social mechanism may be responsible for the observed results. In other words, replicable sex differences in emotion and sexual jealousy could be a function of a social function. Similar studies focusing on the masculinization and feminization by society also argue for a social explanation, while discounting an evolutionary explanation.\n\nA 2015 study found a correlation between AVPR1A expression and predisposition to extrapair mating in women but not in men.\n\nStudies have found that men are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied sexually, while women are more likely to engage in extramarital sex if they are unsatisfied emotionally. Kimmel and Van Der Veen found that sexual satisfaction may be more important to husbands and that wives are more concerned with compatibility with their partners. Studies suggest that individuals who can separate concepts of sex and love are more likely to accept situations where infidelity occurs. One study done by Roscoe, Cavanaugh, & Kennedy found that women indicated relationship dissatisfaction as the number one reason for infidelity, whereas men reported a lack of communication, understanding, and sexual incompatibility. Glass & Wright also found that men and women who are involved in both sexual and emotional infidelities reported being the most dissatisfied in their relationships than those who engaged in either sexual or emotional infidelity alone. In general, marital dissatisfaction overall is the number one reason often reported for infidelity for both sexes.\nIt is important to note that there are many other factors that increase the likelihood of anyone engaging in infidelity. Individuals exhibiting sexually permissive attitudes and those who have had a high number of past sexual relationships are also more likely to engage in infidelity. Other factors such as being well educated, living in an urban centre, being less religious, having a liberal ideology and values, having more opportunities to meet potential partners, and being older affected the likelihood of one being involved in an extramarital affair.\n\nAnthropologists tend to believe humans are neither completely monogamous nor completely polygamous. Anthropologist Bobbi Low says we are \"slightly polygamous\"; while Deborah Blum believes we are \"ambiguously monogamous,\" and slowly moving away from the polygamous habits of our evolutionary ancestors.\n\nAccording to anthropologist Helen Fisher, there are numerous psychological reasons for adultery. Some people may want to supplement a marriage, solve a sex problem, gather more attention, seek revenge, or have more excitement in the marriage. But based on Fisher's research, there also is a biological side to adultery. \"We have two brain systems: one of them is linked to attachment and romantic love, and then there is the other brain system, which is purely sex drive.\" Sometimes these two brain systems are not well-connected, which enables people to become adulterers and satisfy their libido without any regards to their attachment side.\n\nOften, gender differences in both jealousy and infidelity are attributable to cultural factors. This variation stems from the fact that societies differ in how they view extramarital affairs and jealousy. An examination of jealousy across seven nations revealed that each partner in a relationship serves as each other's primary and exclusive source of satisfaction and attention in all cultures. Therefore, when an individual feels jealousy towards another, it is usually because they are now sharing their primary source of attention and satisfaction. However, variation can be seen when identifying the behaviors and actions that betray the role of primary attention (satisfaction) giver. For instance, in certain cultures if an individual goes out with another of the opposite gender, emotions of intense jealousy can result; however, in other cultures, this behavior is perfectly acceptable and is not given much thought.\n\nIt is important to understand where these cultural variations come from and how they root themselves into differing perceptions of infidelity. While many cultures report infidelity as wrong and admonish it, some are more tolerant of such behaviour. These views are generally linked to the overall liberal nature of the society. For instance, Danish society is viewed as more liberal than many other cultures, and as such, have correlating liberal views on infidelity and extramarital affairs. According to Christine Harris and Nicholas Christenfeld, societies that are legally more liberal against extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity because it is distinct from emotional infidelity. In Danish society, having sex does not necessarily imply a deep emotional attachment. As a result, infidelity does not carry such a severe negative connotation. A comparison between modern-day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the U.S. than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society. Often, a single predominant religion can influence the culture of an entire nation. Even within Christianity in the United States, there are discrepancies as to how extramarital affairs are viewed. For instance, Protestants and Catholics do not view infidelity with equal severity. The conception of marriage is also markedly different; while in Roman Catholicism marriage is seen as an indissoluble sacramental bond and does not permit divorce even in cases of infidelity, most Protestant denominations allow for divorce and remarriage for infidelity or other reasons. Ultimately, it was seen that adults that associated with a religion (any denomination) were found to view infidelity as much more distressing than those who were not affiliated with a religion. Those that participated more heavily in their religions were even more conservative in their views on infidelity.\n\nSome research has also suggested that being African American has a positive correlation to infidelity, even when education attainment is controlled for. Other research suggests that lifetime incidence of infidelity does not differ between African Americans and whites, only the likelihood of when they engage in it. Race and gender have been found to be positively correlated with infidelity, however this is the case more often for African American men engaging in extramarital infidelity. Human mating strategies differ from culture to culture. For example, Schmitt discusses how tribal cultures with higher pathogen stress are more likely to have polygynous marriage systems; whereas monogamous mating systems usually have relatively lower high-pathogen environments. In addition researchers have also proposed the idea that high mortality rates in local cultures should be correlated with more permissive mating strategies. On the other hand, Schmitt discusses how demanding reproductive environments should increase the desire and pursuit of biparental, monogamous relationships.\n\nWhile infidelity is by no means exclusive to certain groups of people, its perception can be influenced by other factors. Furthermore, within a \"homogeneous culture,\" like that in the United States, factors like community size can be strong predictors of how infidelity is perceived. Larger communities tend to care less about infidelity whereas small towns are much more concerned with such issues. These patterns are observed in other cultures as well. For example, a cantina in a small, rural Mexican community is often viewed as a place where \"decent\" or \"married\" women do not go because of its semi-private nature. Conversely, public spaces like the market or plaza are acceptable areas for heterosexual interaction. A smaller population size presents the threat of being publicly recognized for infidelity. However, within a larger community of the same Mexican society, entering a bar or watering hole would garner a different view. It would be deemed perfectly acceptable for both married and unmarried individuals to drink at a bar in a large city. These observations can be paralleled to rural and urban societies in the United States as well. Ultimately, these variables and societal differences dictate attitudes towards sexual infidelity which can vary across cultures as well as within cultures.\n\"Mate poaching\" is the phenomenon of a single person luring a person who is in an intimate relationship to have sex outside of that relationship. According to a survey of 16,964 individuals in 53 countries by David Schmitt (2001), mate poaching happens significantly more frequently in Middle Eastern countries such as Turkey and Lebanon, and less frequently in East Asian countries such as China and Japan.\n\nThe parental investment theory is used to explain evolutionary pressures that can account for sex differences in infidelity. This theory states that the sex that invests less in the offspring has more to gain from indiscriminate sexual behaviour. This means that women, who typically invest more time and energy into raising their offspring (9 months of carrying offspring, breast feeding etc.), should be more choosy when it comes to mate selection and should therefore desire long-term, monogamous relationships that would ensure the viability of their offspring. Men on the other hand, have less parental investment and so they are driven towards indiscriminate sexual activity with multiple partners as such activity increases the likelihood of their reproduction. This theory says that it is these evolutionary pressures that act on men and women differentially and what ultimately drives more men to seek sexual activity outside of their own relationships. It can however, still account for the occurrence of extradyadic sexual relationships among women. For example, a woman whose husband has fertilization difficulties can benefit from engaging in sexual activity outside of her relationship. She can gain access to high-quality genes and still derive the benefit of parental investment from her husband or partner who is unknowingly investing in their illegitimate child. Evidence for the development of such a short-term mating strategy in women comes from findings that women who engage in affairs typically do so with men who are of higher status, dominance, physical attractiveness (which is indicative of genetic quality).\n\nOne defense mechanism that some researchers believe is effective at preventing infidelity is jealousy. Jealousy is an emotion that can elicit strong responses. Cases have been commonly documented where sexual jealousy was a direct cause of murders and morbid jealousy. Buss (2005) states that jealousy has three main functions to help prevent infidelity. These suggestions are:\nLooking at jealousy's physiological mechanism offers support for this idea. Jealousy is a form of stress response which has been shown to activate the sympathetic nervous system by increasing heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration. This will activate the \"fight or flight\" response to ensure action against the attempt at sexual infidelity in their partner. Buss and his colleagues were the first to pioneer a theory that jealousy is an evolved human emotion that has become an innate module, hard-wired to prevent infidelity from occurring. This idea is commonly referred to as Jealousy as a Specific Innate Module and has become widely debated. The basis behind this argument is that jealousy was beneficial in our ancestor's time when cuckoldry was more common. They suggested that those who were equipped with this emotional response could more effectively stop infidelity and those without the emotional response had a harder time doing so. Because infidelity imposed such a fitness cost, those who had the jealous emotional response, improved their fitness, and could pass down the jealousy module to the next generation.\n\nAnother defense mechanism for preventing infidelity is by social monitoring and acting on any violation of expectations. Researchers in favor of this defense mechanism speculate that in our ancestor's times, the act of sex or emotional infidelity is what triggered jealousy and therefore the signal detection would have happened only after infidelity had occurred, making jealousy an emotional by-product with no selective function. In line with this reasoning, these researchers hypothesize that as a person monitors their partner's actions with a potential rival through primary and secondary appraisals; if their expectations are violated at either level of observation, they will become distressed and enact an appropriate action to stop the chance of infidelity. Social monitoring therefore enables them to act accordingly before infidelity occurs, thereby having the capability to raise their fitness. Research testing this theory has found more favor for the sexual jealousy hypothesis.\n\nA more recently suggested defense mechanism of infidelity attracting more attention is that a particular social group will punish cheaters by damaging their reputation. The basis for this suggestion stems from the fact that humans have an unmatched ability to monitor social relationships and inflict punishment on cheaters, regardless of the context. This punishment comes in many forms, one of which is gossip. This damage will impair the future benefits that individual can confer from the group and its individuals. A damaged reputation is especially debilitating when related to sexual and emotional infidelity, because it can limit future reproductive mate choices within the group and will cause a net fitness cost that outweighs the fitness benefit gained from the infidelity. Such limitations and costs deter an individual from cheating in the first place. Support for this defense mechanism comes from fieldwork by Hirsch and his colleagues (2007) that found that gossip about extramarital affairs in a small community in Mexico was particularly prevalent and devastating for reputation in this region. Specifically, adultery was found to cause an individual to be disowned by their family, decrease the marriage value of his/her family, cause an individual to lose money or a job, and diminish future reproductive potential. In this community, men having extramarital affairs did so in private areas with lower prevalence of women connected to the community, such as bars and brothels, both areas of which had a high risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe proliferation of sex chat rooms and dating apps has increased the opportunity for people in committed relationships to engage in acts of infidelity on and off the Internet. A cyber affair is defined as \"a romantic or sexual relationship initiated by online contact and maintained primarily via online communication\". Sexual acts online include behaviors such as cybersex, where two or more individuals engage in discussions about sexual fantasies over the Internet and is usually accompanied by masturbation; hotchatting, where discussions between two or more people move away from light-hearted flirting; and emotional acts where people disclose intimate information to a significant other. A new type of sexual activity online is when two people's avatars engage in sexual activity in virtual reality worlds such \"The Sims\" or \"Second Life\". The majority of Americans believe that if a partner engaged in cybersex this constitutes as an act of infidelity.\n\nA 2005 survey of 1828 participants reported one third of them reported engaging in cybersex and of that one third, 46% said they were in a committed relationship with someone else.\n\nIn an attempt to differentiate offline and online infidelity, Cooper, Morahan-Martin, Mathy, and Maheu constructed a \"Triple-A Engine\", which identifies the three aspects of Internet infidelity that distinguish it, to some degree, from traditional infidelity:\n\n\nIn a study of 335 Dutch undergraduate students involved in serious intimate relationships, participants were presented with four dilemmas concerning a partner's emotional and sexual infidelity over the Internet. They found a significant sex difference as to whether participants chose sexual and emotional infidelity as more upsetting. More men than women indicated that a partner's sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner's emotional bonding with someone else. Similarly, in the dilemma involving infidelity over the Internet, more men indicated their partner's sexual involvement would upset them more than a partner's emotional bonding with someone else. Women, on the other hand, expressed more problems with emotional infidelity over the Internet than did men.\n\nOnline infidelity can be just as damaging to a relationship as offline physical unfaithfulness. A possible explanation is that our brain registers virtual and physical acts the same way and responds similarly. Several studies have concluded that online infidelity, whether sexual or emotional in nature, often leads to off-line infidelity.\n\nA study by Beatriz Lia Avila Mileham in 2004 examined the phenomenon of online infidelity in chat rooms. The following factors were investigated: what elements and dynamics online infidelity involves and how it happens; what leads individuals specifically to the computer to search for a relationship \"on the side\"; whether individuals consider online contacts as infidelity and why or why not; and what dynamics chat room users experience in their marriages. The results lead to three constructs that symbolize chat room dynamics and serve as a foundation for Internet infidelity. They include anonymous sexual interactionism, behavioral rationalization, and effortless avoidance:\n\nAll countries in Europe, as well as most countries in Latin America have decriminalized adultery; however, in many countries in Africa and Asia (particularly the Middle East) this type of infidelity is criminalized. Even where infidelity is not a criminal offense, it may have legal implications in divorce cases; for example it may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. In civil claims, not only the spouse, but also the \"other man/other woman\" may be held accountable: for example, seven US states (Hawaii, Illinois, North Carolina, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Dakota, and Utah) allow the possibility of the tort action of alienation of affections (brought by a deserted spouse against a third party alleged to be responsible for the failure of the marriage). In a highly publicized case in 2010, a woman in North Carolina won a $9 million suit against her husband's mistress. In the United States, criminal laws relating to infidelity vary, and those states that criminalize adultery rarely prosecute the offense. Penalties for adultery range from life imprisonment in Michigan, to a $10 fine in Maryland or class 1 felony in Wisconsin. The constitutionality of US criminal laws on adultery is unclear due to Supreme Court decisions in 1965 giving privacy of sexual intimacy to consenting adults, as well as broader implications of \"Lawrence v. Texas\" (2003). Adultery is declared to be illegal in 21 states.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, adultery may have indirect legal implications, particularly in cases of infliction of violence, such as domestic assaults and killings, in particular by mitigating murder to manslaughter, or otherwise providing for partial or complete defenses in case of violence, especially in cultures where there is a traditional toleration of crimes of passion and honor killings. Such provisions have been condemned by the Council of Europe and the United Nations in recent years. The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should: (...) \"57. preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family\". UN Women has also stated in regard to the defense of provocation and other similar defenses: \"\"Laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of \"honour\", adultery, or domestic assault or murder\".\"\n\nOne of the biggest problems with sexuality research is that many people will not openly admit to acts of infidelity unless they are assured complete anonymity. Additionally, there is confusion as to what exactly constitutes infidelity. Some consider that infidelity requires sexual intercourse; others that physical acts other than intercourse might constitute infidelity, and still others that emotional infidelity is possible without any physical acts whatsoever.\n\nA standardized definition of infidelity, used by the International Infidelity Law Consortium, includes the following acts:\n\n\nAs the number of women in the workforce increases to match that men, researchers expect the likelihood of infidelity will also increase with workplace interations. Wiggins and Lederer (1984) found that opportunities to engage in infidelity were related to the workplace where nearly one half of their samples who engaged in infidelity were involved with coworkers. A study done by McKinnish (2007) found that those who work with a larger fraction of workers of the opposite sex are more likely to be divorced due to infidelity. Kuroki found married women were less likely to have a workplace affair, whereas self-employed individuals are more likely. In 2000, Treas and Giesen found similar results where sexual opportunities in the workplace increased the likelihood of infidelity during the last 12 months.\n\nAdulterous office romances are widely considered to be unhelpful to business and work relationships, and superior-subordinate relationships are banned in 90% of companies with written policies regarding office romance. Companies cannot ban adultery, as, in all but a handful of states, such regulations would run afoul of laws prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status. Firings nonetheless often occur on the basis of charges of inappropriate office conduct.\n\nAcademics and therapists say cheating is probably more prevalent on the road than close to home. The protection of the road offers a secret life of romance, far from spouses or partners. Affairs range from one-night stands to relationships that last for years. They are usually with a co-worker, a business associate or someone they repeatedly encounter.\n\nAnother reason for the development of office romances is the amount of time co-workers spend together. Spouses today often spend more time with co-workers in the office than with each other. A \"Newsweek\" article notes, \"Nearly 60 percent of American women work outside the home, up from about 40 percent in 1964. Quite simply, women intersect with more people during the day than they used to. They go to more meetings, take more business trips and, presumably, participate more in flirtatious water-cooler chatter.\"\n\nAccording to Debra Laino in an article for \"Shave\", some of the reasons women cheat at the workplace are because \"women are disproportionately exposed to men in the workplace, and, as a direct consequence, many have more options and chances to cheat.\"\n\nSome studies suggest that only a small percentage of couples that experience infidelity actually improve their relationship, whereas others report couples having surprisingly positive relationship outcomes. In terms of negative responses to infidelity, Charney and Parnass (1995) report that after hearing of a partner's infidelity, reactions have included rage and increased aggressiveness, loss of trust, decreased personal and sexual confidence, sadness, depression, damaged self-esteem, fear of abandonment, and a surge of justification to leave their partner. Another study reported nearly 60% of the partners cheated on suffered emotional problems and depression following disclosure of the affair. Other negative consequences have included damage to relationships with children, parents, and friends, as well as legal consequences. A report in 1983 reported that of a sample of 205 divorced individuals, about one half said their marital problems were caused by their spouse's infidelity.\n\nThe negative impact of infidelity on a relationship depends on how involved partners are in their infidelity relationship, and researchers maintain that infidelity itself does not cause divorce but the overall level of relationship satisfaction, motives for infidelity, level of conflict, and attitudes held about infidelity do. In fact, Schneider, et al. (1999) reported that even though 60% of their participants initially threatened to leave their primary relationship, a threat to leave due to infidelity did not actually predict the eventual outcome. Atkins, Eldridge, Baucom, and Christiansen found that couples who went through therapy as well as openly dealt with the infidelity were able to change at a faster rate than distressed couples who were just in therapy. Some unintended positive outcomes that have been reported for couples experiencing infidelity include closer marital relationships, increased assertiveness, taking better care of oneself, placing higher value on family, and realizing the importance of marital communication.\n\nIf divorce results from infidelity, research suggest that the \"faithful\" spouse may experience feelings of low life satisfaction and self-esteem; they may also engage in future relationships fearful of the same incidence occurring. Sweeney and Horwitz (2001) found that individuals who initiated a divorce after hearing about their partner's infidelity experienced less depression; however, the opposite was true when the offending spouse initiated divorce.\n\nInfidelity causes extreme Emotions to occur between males and females alike. Emotions have been proven to change through this process. Below, the three phases of infidelity (beginning, during and after) are explained.\n\nThe “Before” Stage:\n\nInfidelity is the biggest fear in most romantic relationships and even friendships. No individual wants to be cheated on and replaced by another, this act usually makes people feel unwanted, jealous, angry and incompetent. The initial stage of the infidelity process is the suspicious beginning; the stage in which it has not been proven, but warning signs are beginning to surface. While suspicion is not hard evidence in infidelity and cannot prove anything, it does affect a person's affective emotions and cognitive states. Jealousy, the feeling of incompetence, and anger can all be felt in both the affective and cognitive states of emotions; infidelity has a different impact in each of those connected states.\n\nAffective emotions and response are a primary factor in the initial stages of infidelity on both sides. Affective behaviors are how we deal with emotions that we do not anticipate. An affective response immediately indicates to an individual whether something is pleasant or unpleasant and whether they decide to approach or avoid a situation.\n\nTo begin, affective emotions and the effect infidelity has on affective jealousy. Both men and women alike feel some kind of jealousy when they suspect their significant other is being unfaithful. If some individual suspects that he or she is being cheated on they begin to question their partner's actions and may possibly act in more frustrated ways towards them than they normally would. The affective use of jealousy in a seemingly unfaithful relationship is caused by the accusing partner anticipating the infidelity from the other.\n\nAnother affective emotion in this beginning stage is incompetence. Feeling incompetent can spring from multiple things in a relationship, but during the initial stages of infidelity, a person can experience this on an increased level. When someone is having incompetent feelings due to someone else's actions they begin to resent them, creating a build-up and eventually an affective emotion outburst over something small. The faithful partner is not normally aware that their suspicion is the reason they feel incompetent in the relationship and do not expect to be so irritated by the change of simple things; making it an affective response in this stage of infidelity. These unanticipated emotions could lead to more and multiple responses such as this one within the future of the initial stage of infidelity.\n\nAn additional affective response or emotion seen in initial infidelity is anger. Anger is an emotion that is felt in all stages of infidelity, but in different ways and at different calibers. In the initial stages of infidelity anger is an underlying emotion that is usually exposed after the buildup of other emotions such as jealousy and Resentment. Anger is noticed to be a key emotion within a situation like infidelity, it takes on many roles and forms throughout the process but in the initial stage of cheating, anger can be an affective emotion because of how unpredictable and rapid it can happen without thinking of one's actions and feelings before doing so.\n\nCognitive emotions and states tend to be felt in the initial stages of infidelity whenever the faithful partner is alone or left alone by the suspected unfaithful one. Cognitive emotions and responses are that of those in which an individual anticipates them. Once couples begin to anticipate the actions and emotions of their partners, even if evidence have not been set forth, the emotions of infidelity enter a cognitive state.\n\nTo begin with cognitive responses in infidelity, individuals who have been cheated on experience jealousy cognitively for many reasons. They may feel that their partner has lost interest in them and feel that they cannot compare to the persons with whom they are being cheated on with. Therefore, they anticipate the loss of their partner's emotional interest in them and become jealous for more clear reasons. The anticipation of jealous feelings towards an individual's significant other causes a cognitive response, even without the burden of proof.\n\nSome more cognitive responses in the young stages of infidelity are incompetence and resentfulness. In the initial stages of infidelity, the feeling of incompetence can lead to cognitive resentment. The partner being cheated on will begin to feel that anything and everything they do is not enough, they may feel incompetent in the ways of love, affection, or sex. Whenever an individual suspects that they are being cheated on they try to change their behavior in hopes of keeping or getting their partner's attention back onto themselves instead of on the person whom they are having another relationship with. People cheat for many reasons and each of those can cause a faithful person to believe they are not competent enough to be in a romantic relationship. This feeling leads to the resentment of the unfaithful partner's actions and becomes an ongoing emotion throughout the stages of infidelity instead of simply being a quick and immediate response to a partner's actions.\n\nLastly, anger in infidelity is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity, anger is not as apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not hard facts or evidence supporting one's suspicions. As previously talked about, the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent in the first stage of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual's anger because in reality there is nothing yet to be angry about, there is no proof of their romantic partner's unfaithfulness. It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner because of the lack of evidence they have.\n\nThe “During” Stage:\n\nInfidelity, perhaps the worst relational crime, is defined as the action or state of being unfaithful to a romantic partner. The victim of the crime can experience long-lasting emotional damage as a result. According to the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 15% of married women and 25% of married men cheat on their spouse. Being in a close relationship with another person is a huge part of human existence. Mikukincer goes on to talk about how the most obvious reason for relationship is to engage in sexual acts to reproduce. Relationships give people a sense of belongingness and contributes to self-esteem.\n\nAccording to the Attachment theory, intimates develop mental representations of the availability of close others that lead to strong cognitive and behavioral patterns of responding to those others. Those who develop a more secure attachment style believe others are available to them and behave accordingly, those who develop an insecure attachment tend to believe others are less available to them and behave accordingly. According to Brennan and Shaver, 1995 and Feeney and Noller, 1990 said that people who develop high levels of attachment have more anxiety and uncertainty. Those types of people cope by seeking reassurance and clinging themselves to another person. These types of insecurity can be related to marital infidelity. With attachment theory, people seek sex to help meet their needs.\n\nThe effects of your partner's unfaithfulness can cause an emotional trauma. It is a painful experience that only creates negative emotional effect(s). “We know that infidelity is one of the most distressing and damaging events couples face. The person who was cheated on experiences strong emotional and psychological distress following infidelity,” said Rosie Shrout, a social psychology professor at the University of Nevada, Reno who specializes in romantic relationships.\n\nGender self-esteem greatly affects infidelity. Men's self-esteem is driven on a sexual level and women's self-esteem is driven on an emotional level, because of that there would be different results when facing an infidelity threat. The cause of these different jealousy's have developed over time due to evolutionary changes.\n\nA study was conducted to determine if men and women actually base their self-esteem on different contingencies. There were a total of 65 participants, 33 men and 32 women. They were asked questions regarding their self-worth and told to answer them on a scale of importance to them. The study did indeed prove their hypothesis. It proved that sex was more relevant to men than to women and being in a healthy emotional relationship was more important to women than to men.\n\nThose who are cheated on experience a great amount of anxiety, stress and depression. Shrout was among researchers who conducted a study based on the hypothesis that people experiencing those emotions because of an infidelity are more likely to engage in activities that are a health risk. Health-compromising behaviors such as depriving themselves of food and nutrients, consuming alcohol or using drugs more often, increased sexual activity, having sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol or over-exercising.\n\nThe experiment Shrout and her colleagues conducted validated their hypothesis, showing a direct link between emotions caused by infidelity and an increase in dangerous behaviors. Being cheated on seems to not only to have mental health consequences, but also increases risky behaviors. The study consisted of 232 college students, the average age of participants was 20, who had been cheated on within the last month. The study examined the link between the emotional distress caused by infidelity and health-compromising behaviors, perception of blame and self-esteem, and the differences in the reactions of men and women.\n\nNot only did they prove the connection between the distress and risky behavior, but they also found that those who blamed themselves for their partners unfaithfulness were also more like to participate in risky behavior.\n\nThe researchers proved the more distress you feel the more likely the individual is to take part in unhealthy acts and the more the victim blamed themselves the more distress they experienced. They also found that women felt more emotional distress than men and were more likely to blame themselves than men were.\n\n“We think this is because women typically place higher importance on the relationship as a source of self and identity,” said Shrout.\n\nShrout's study concluded that women who experienced negative appraisals, like self-blame and causal attribution, led to emotional distress and increased health-compromising behavior. Studies show that men typically only experience distress from a physical or sexual affair, while women are more bothered by emotional or relational affairs. However, women are more affected than men. This is due perception; women perceive relationships as more of a priority and are usually more emotionally attached.\n\n“To put simply, women are evolved to invest far more in a relationship than a man is,” said Binghamton University researcher and the study's lead author, Craig Morris.\n\nShrout and her team in Reno's initial hypothesis was proven: not only do victims of infidelity experience emotional trauma, but that trauma leads to more risky actions or behaviors. In addition to the behaviors first examined, such as depriving themselves of food and nutrients, consuming alcohol or using drugs more often, increased sexual activity, having sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol or over-exercising, people also felt a loss of trust that expands beyond romantic relationships. Victims can become strained from their family members.\n\nThe “After” Stage:\n\nSeveral emotions are present after the act of infidelity. Jealousy is a common emotion after infidelity. The definition of jealousy is the feeling or showing suspicion of someone's unfaithfulness in a relationship or losing something or someone's attention. Individual differences were predictors of jealousy, which differed for men and women. Predictors for men were sex drive, attachment avoidance and previous acts of infidelity. Predictors for women were sex drive and relationship status. Attachment and sexual motivations likely influence the evolved jealousy mechanism. Men responded with greater self-reported jealousy and psychological distress when imagining their partner in Extra-pair copulation, whereas, women were more upset by the thoughts of an emotionally unfaithful partner.\n\nGroup differences were also found, with women responding with stronger emotions to emotional and sexual infidelity than men. Heterosexuals valued emotional and sexual infidelity as more emotionally draining than homosexuals individuals did. Sex and sexual orientation differences emerged regarding the degree to which specific emotions were reported in response to sexual and emotional infidelity.\n\nSummarizing the findings from studies, heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men. The latter three groups seem more responsible for the difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men. However, within-sex analysis reveals that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity.\n\nAfter infidelity stress was present. The imbalance causes jealousy in unfaithful relationships and jealousy remained after the relationship concluded. Women displayed an insecure long-term mating response. Lack of self-worth is evident after the infidelity in the daily life and involvement.\n\nMarriage counseling is generally provided by licensed therapists or clinical psychologists known as couple, marriage, or family therapists (see family therapy and emotionally focused therapy). These therapists provide the same mental health services as other therapists, but with a specific focus – a couple's relationship.\n\nRelationship counseling typically brings partners together for joint sessions. The counselor or therapist helps couples pinpoint and understand the sources of their conflicts and try to resolve them. Partners evaluate both the good and bad parts of their relationship. Integrative behavioral couples therapy has shown success in increasing intimacy after an affair.\n\nSwinging is a form of extradyadic sex where married couples exchange partners with each other. Swinging was originally called \"wife-swapping\", but due to the sexist connotations and the fact that many wives were willing to swap partners, \"mate swapping\" and or \"swinging\" was substituted. The Supreme Court in Canada has ruled swinging is legal as long as it takes place in a private place and is consensual. Swinging can be closed or open, where couples meet and each pair goes off to a separate room or they have sex in the same room. The majority of swingers fall into the middle and upper classes, with an above average education and income, and majority of these swingers are white (90%). A study done by Jenks in 1986 found that swingers are not significantly different from non-swingers on measures such as philosophy, authoritarianism, self-respect, happiness, freedom, equality etc. Swingers tend to emphasize personal values over more social ones. According to Henshel (1973), the initiation into the world of swinging usually is done by the husband.\n\nReasons for getting involved in swinging are the variety of sexual partners and experiences, pleasure or excitement, meeting new people, and voyeurism. In order for swinging to work, both partners need to have a liberal sexual predisposition, and a low degree of jealously. Gilmartin (1975) found that 85% of his sample of swingers felt that these sexual encounters posed no real threat to their marriage and felt it had improved. Jenks (1998) found no reason to believe that swinging was detrimental to marriage, with over 91% of males and 82% of females indicating they were happy with swinging.\nAnother form of extradyadic sex is polyamory, a \"non-possessive, honest, responsible and ethical philosophy and practice of loving multiple people simultaneously\". There are various types of relationships in polyamory such as intentional family, group relationship, and group marriage. One type of group relationship can be a triad involving a married couple and an additional person who all share sexual intimacy, however, it is usually an addition of a female. Unlike polygyny or polyandry, both men and women may have multiple partners within the confines of polyamory. Polyamorous relationships are distinguished from extramarital affairs by the full disclosure and consent of all involved. Polyamorous relationships may specify unique boundaries outside monogomous expectations of fidelity, that if violated are still considered cheating. Because both men and women can have multiple partners, these individuals do not consider themselves to be either uncommitted or unfaithful.\n\nEvolutionary researchers have suggested that men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, especially for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women. This is because it is thought that the threat of cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring that is another male's, and for females, emotional infidelity would be more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment in their offspring for another woman's offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However the evidence for this gender difference is debatable, as new findings are suggesting that more and more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse.\n\nFor one researcher, Symons (1979), sexual jealously is the major cause that homosexual men are supposedly unsuccessful in maintaining monogamous relationships. Symons suggests that all men are innately disposed to want sexual variation and that the difference between heterosexual and homosexual men is that homosexual men can find willing partners more often for casual sex, and thus satisfy this innate desire for sexual variety. However, according to this view, all men are hard wired to be sexually jealous; therefore suggesting that gay men should be more upset by sexual infidelity than by emotional infidelity, and that lesbians should be more upset by emotional infidelity than compared to sexual infidelity. Recent studies suggest that in fact it may not be an innate mechanism but that it depends on the importance placed on sexual exclusivity. Peplau and Cochran (1983) found that sexual exclusivity was much more important to heterosexual men and women compared to homosexual men and women. This theory suggests that it is not sexuality that may lead to differences but that people are prone to jealousy in domains that are especially important to them.\n\nA study done by Harris (2002) tested these hypotheses among 210 individuals, 48 homosexual women, 50 homosexual men, 40 heterosexual women, and 49 heterosexual men. Results found that more heterosexual than homosexual individuals picked sexual infidelity as worse than emotional infidelity, with heterosexual men being the highest, and that when forced to choose, gay men overwhelmingly predicted emotional infidelity would be more troubling than sexual infidelity. These findings contradict Symons (1979) suggestion that there would be no gender difference in predicted responses to infidelity by sexual orientation; however more research in this area should be conducted. Blow and Bartlett (2005) suggest that even though sex outside of a homosexual relationship might be seen as more acceptable in some relationships, the consequences of infidelity do not occur without pain or jealousy.\n\nHeterosexuals rated emotional and sexual infidelity as more emotionally distressing than lesbian and gay individuals did. Sex and sexual orientation differences emerged regarding the degree to which specific emotions were reported in response to sexual and emotional infidelity. Few researchers have explored the influence of sexual orientation on which type of infidelity is viewed as more distressing.\n\nSummarizing the findings from these studies, heterosexual men seem to be more distressed by sexual infidelity than heterosexual women, lesbian women, and gay men. These latter three groups seem more responsible for this difference by reporting similarly higher levels of distress toward emotional infidelity than heterosexual men. However, as previously noted, within-sex analyses reveal that heterosexual men tend to rate emotional infidelity as more distressing than sexual infidelity.\n\n\n\n"}

According to Jains, knowledge is the essence of the soul. This knowledge is masked by the karmic particles. As the soul obtains knowledge through various means, it does not generate anything new. It only shreds off the knowledge-obscuring karmic particles. According to Jainism, consciousness is a primary attribute of \"Jīva\" (soul) and this consciousness manifests itself as \"darsana\" (perception) and \"jnana\" (knowledge).\n\nAccording to Jain text, Tattvartha sutra, knowledge (\"Jnana\") is of five kinds:-\n\n\nThe first two kinds of knowledge are regarded as indirect (knowledge) and remaining three as direct knowledge.\n\nThe knowledge acquired through the empirical perception and mind is termed as \"Mati Jnana\" (Sensory knowledge). According to Jain epistemology, sense perception is the knowledge which the \"Jīva\" (soul) acquires of the environment through the intermediary of material sense organs. This is divided into four processes:\n\nThe knowledge acquired through understanding of verbal and written sentences etc, is termed as \"Śhrut Jnāna\". \n\nAs per Jains, the knowledge of \"Śhrut Jnāna\", may be of things which are contained in the \"Angas\" (Limbs or sacred Jain books) or of things outside the Angas.\n\nClairvoyance is mentioned as \"avadhi jnana\" in Jain scriptures. According to Jain text Sarvārthasiddhi, \"this kind of knowledge has been called \"avadhi\" as it ascertains matter in downward range or knows objects within limits\". The beings of hell and heaven (devas) are said to possess clairvoyance by birth. Six kinds of clairvoyance is mentioned in the Jain scriptures.\n\nAccording to Jainism, the soul can directly know the thoughts of others. Such knowledge comes under the category of 'Manhaparyaya Jnana'.\n\nBy Shredding of the karmic particles, the soul acquires perfect knowledge. With such a knowledge, the knowledge and soul becomes one. Such a knowledge is Kevala Jnana.\n\nJains maintain that knowledge is the nature of the soul. According to Champat Rai Jain: \n\nAnēkāntavāda refers to the principles of perspectivism and multiplicity of viewpoints, the notion that truth and reality are perceived differently from diverse points of view, and that no single point of view is the complete truth.\n\nJains contrast all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with \"adhgajanyāyah\", which can be illustrated through the parable of the \"blind men and an elephant\". This principle is more formally stated by observing that objects are infinite in their qualities and modes of existence, so they cannot be completely grasped in all aspects and manifestations by finite human perception. According to the Jains, only the \"Kevalis\"—omniscient beings—can comprehend objects in all aspects and manifestations; others are only capable of partial knowledge. Consequently, no single, specific, human view can claim to represent absolute truth.\n\nThe doctrine of multiple viewpoints (Sanskrit: Nayavāda), holds that the ways of looking at things (Naya) are infinite in number. This is manifested in scripture by use of conditional propositions, called Syādvāda (syād = 'perhaps, may be'). The seven used conditional principles are listed below.\n\n"}
{"id": "16573", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16573", "title": "James Flynn (academic)", "text": "James Flynn (academic)\n\nJames Robert Flynn FRSNZ (born 1934) is a New Zealand intelligence researcher. An Emeritus Professor of Political Studies at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand, he is famous for his publications about the continued year-after-year increase of IQ scores throughout the world, which is now referred to as the Flynn effect. The Flynn effect is the subject of a multiple author monograph published by the American Psychological Association in 1998. Originally from Washington, DC and educated at the University of Chicago, Flynn emigrated to New Zealand in 1963.\n\nFlynn's son Victor is a mathematics professor at New College, Oxford.\n\nFlynn has written a variety of books. His research interests include humane ideals and ideological debate, classics of political philosophy, and race, class and IQ (see race and intelligence). His books combine political and moral philosophy with psychology to examine problems such as justifying humane ideals and whether it makes sense to rank races and classes by merit. He is currently a member of the editorial board of \"Intelligence\" and on the Honorary International Advisory Editorial Board of the Mens Sana Monographs.\n\nFlynn defines intelligence to be independent of culture, emphasising that the style of thought required to deal with problems of survival in a desert (mapping, tracking..), is different from that required to do well in the modern West (academic achievement etc.), but that both undoubtedly require intelligence.\n\nIn 1987, Arthur Jensen praised Flynn's criticism of Jensen's own work in a chapter summarizing an academic book about Jensen's research on human intelligence.\n\nNow and then I am asked by colleagues, students, and journalists: who, in my opinion, are the most respectable critics of my position on the race-IQ issue? The name James R. Flynn is by far the first that comes to mind. His book, \"Race, IQ and Jensen\" (1980), is a distinguished contribution to the literature on this topic, and, among the critiques I have seen of my position, is virtually in a class by itself for objectivity, thoroughness, and scholarly integrity.\nA 1999 article published in American Psychologist, summarises much of his research. On the alleged genetic inferiority of Blacks on IQ tests, he lays out the argument and evidence for such a belief, and then contests each point. He interprets the direct evidence—when Blacks are raised in settings that are less disadvantageous—as suggesting that environmental factors explain genetic differences. And yet, he argues that the environmental explanation gained force after the discovery that IQ scores were rising over time. Inter-generational IQ differences among Whites and across nations were larger than the Black-White IQ Gap and could not be accounted for by genetic factors, which, if anything, should have reduced IQ, according to scholars he references. He posits that the Black-White IQ score gap can be entirely explained by environmental factors if \"the average environment for Blacks in 1995 matches the quality of the average environment for Whites in 1945.\"\n\nFlynn's 2007 book \"What Is Intelligence?\" impressed Charles Murray, a co-author of the book \"The Bell Curve,\" who wrote in a statement published on the book's back cover, \"This book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work, much of which was new to me. All of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that Flynn discusses are in his debt.\"\n\nFlynn is transparent about his belief in racial equality in his work, but he advocates for open scientific debate about controversial social science claims and is critical of the suppression of research into race and intelligence, where \"courses are taught on \"The Bell Curve\" that do not assign the Bell Curve, where courses on intelligence are not offered simply because some student might raise the question of racial differences, where someone taking IQ seriously would be ostracized in an education or gender studies department, where the history of the black family is distorted for political purposes, where scholars rise in wrath when a speaker details obvious ethnic differences\". He only urges those with related beliefs to refrain from advancing them without solid evidence.\n\nFlynn's 2010 book \"The Torchlight List\" proposes the controversial idea that a person can learn more from reading great works of literature than they can from going to university.\n\nFlynn has described himself as an \"atheist, a scientific realist, a social democrat\".\n\nThe \"Flynn effect\" is the name given to a substantial and long-sustained increase in intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world. When intelligence quotient (IQ) tests are initially standardised using a sample of test-takers, by convention the average of the test results is set to 100 and their standard deviation is set to 15 IQ points. When IQ tests are revised they are again standardised using a new sample of test-takers, usually born more recently than the first. Again, the average result is set to 100. However, when the new test subjects take the older tests, in almost every case their average scores are significantly above 100.\n\nTest score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present. For the Raven's Progressive Matrices test, subjects born over a 100-year period were compared in Des Moines, Iowa, and separately in Dumfries, Scotland. Improvements were remarkably consistent across the whole period, in both countries. This effect of an apparent increase in IQ has also been observed in various other parts of the world, though the rates of increase vary.\n\nThere are numerous proposed explanations of the Flynn effect, as well as some scepticism about its implications. Similar improvements have been reported for other cognitions such as semantic and episodic memory. Recent research suggests that the Flynn effect may have ended in at least a few developed nations, possibly allowing national differences in IQ scores to diminish if the Flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national IQs.\n\nFlynn himself, with co-worker William Dickens, has suggested an explanatory model which points to two-way causality between IQ and environment: a cognitively challenging environment raises an individual’s IQ, while in addition a higher individual IQ makes it more likely that an individual will self-select or be sorted into more cognitively challenging environments \n\nIn 1967, Flynn served as a chairperson for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), a civil rights organisation in the US South. (In \"Where Have All the Liberals Gone?\" (p. 278), Flynn states that in the early 1960s in America, he was consistently fired for his Social Democratic politics, prompting his emigration).\n\nFlynn campaigns passionately for left-wing causes, and became an initiating member of both the NewLabour Party and of the Alliance. He also advised Labour Prime Minister Norman Kirk on foreign policy. He has stood as a parliamentary candidate in general elections on several occasions, for example in the electorate in the and s on the Alliance list, and most recently in again as an Alliance list candidate. In 2008 he acted as the Alliance spokesperson for finance and taxation.\n\nDuring 2007, new research from the 2006 New Zealand census showed that women without a tertiary (college) education had produced 2.57 babies each, compared to 1.85 babies for those women with a higher education. During July 2007, \"The Sunday Star-Times\" quoted Flynn as saying that New Zealand risked having a less intelligent population and that a \"persistent genetic trend which lowered the genetic quality for brain physiology would have some effect eventually\". He referred to hypothetical eugenicists' suggestions for reversing the trend, including some sort of oral contraceptive \"in the water supply and … an antidote\" to conceive.\n\nFlynn later articulated his own views on the \"Close Up\" television program in an interview with Paul Henry, suggesting that the \"Sunday Star-Times\" had grossly misrepresented his opinions. In the article, Flynn argued that he never intended for his suggestion to be taken seriously, as he only said this to illustrate a particular point.\n\nIn July 2012, several media outlets reported Flynn as claiming that women had, for the first time in a century, surpassed men on IQ tests based on a study he conducted in 2010. However, Flynn announced that the media had seriously distorted his results and went beyond his claims, revealing that he had instead discovered that the differences between men and women on one particular test, the Raven's Progressive Matrices, had become minimal in five modernised nations (whereas before 1982 women had scored significantly lower). Women, he argued, caught up to men in these nations as a result of exposure to modernity by entering the professions and being allowed greater educational access. Therefore, he claimed, when a total account of the Flynn Effect is considered, women's closing the gap had moved them up in IQ slightly faster than men as a result. Flynn had previously documented this same trend among ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups. According to Flynn, the sexes are \"dead equal on cognitive factors ... in their ability to deal with using logic on the abstract problems of Raven's,\" but that temperamental differences in the way boys and girls take the tests likely account for the tiny variations in mean scores, rather than any difference in intellectual ability.\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "477255", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=477255", "title": "Johann Jakob Wettstein", "text": "Johann Jakob Wettstein\n\nJohann Jakob Wettstein (also Wetstein; 5 March 1693 – 23 March 1754) was a Protestant Swiss theologian, best known as a New Testament critic.\n\nJohann Jakob Wettstein was born in Basel. Among his tutors in theology was Samuel Werenfels (1657–1740), an influential anticipator of modern critical exegesis. While still a student, Wettstein began to direct his attention to the special pursuit of his life, the text of the Greek New Testament. A relative, Johann Wettstein, who was the university librarian, gave him permission to examine and collate the principal manuscripts of the New Testament in the library, and he copied the various readings which they contained into his copy of Gerard of Maastricht's edition of the Greek text.\n\nIn 1713 in his public examination he defended a dissertation entitled \"De variis Novi Testamenti lectionibus\", and sought to show that variety of readings did not detract from the authority of the Bible. Wettstein paid great attention also to Aramaic and Talmudic Hebrew. In the spring of 1714 he undertook an academic tour, which led him to Paris and England, the great object of his inquiry everywhere being to examine manuscripts of the New Testament. In 1716 he made the acquaintance of Richard Bentley at the University of Cambridge; Bentley took great interest in his work and persuaded him to return to Paris to collate carefully the \"Codex Ephraemi\", Bentley having then in view a critical edition of the New Testament.\n\nIn July 1717 Wettstein returned to take the office of a minister at large (\"diaconus communis\") at Basel, a post which he held for three years, after which he became his father's colleague and successor in the parish of St Leonard's. At the same time he pursued his favourite study, and gave private lectures on New Testament exegesis. It was then that he decided to prepare a critical edition of the Textus Receptus (Greek New Testament}. He had in the meantime broken with Bentley, whose famous \"Proposals\" appeared in 1720. His earlier teachers, however, J. C. Iselin and J. L. Frey, who were engaged upon work similar to his own, became so unfriendly towards him that after a time he was forbidden any further use of the manuscripts in the library.\n\nA rumour began to be circulated that Wettstein's projected text would take the Socinian side in the case of such passages as i Timothy iii. 16; and in other ways (e.g. by regarding Jesus's temptation as a subjective experience, and by explaining some of the miracles in a naturalistic way) he began to be suspected of heresy. At length in 1729 the charge of projecting an edition of the Greek Testament savouring of Arian and Socinian views was formally laid against him. The end of the long and unedifying trial was his dismissal, on 13 May 1730, from his office of minister of St Leonard's.\n\nHe then moved from Basel to Amsterdam, where another relative, Johann Heinrich Wettstein (1649–1726), had an important printing and publishing business. Here excellent editions of the classics were being published, as well as Gerard of Maastricht's edition of the Greek Testament. Wettstein had begun to print an edition of the Greek Testament, but this was suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. As soon as he reached Amsterdam, in 1730, he published anonymously the \"Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci editionem\", which he had proposed should accompany his Greek Testament, and which was later republished by him, with additions, in 1751. The next year (1731) the Remonstrants offered him the chair of philosophy in their college at Amsterdam, vacated by the illness of Jean Leclerc, on condition that he clear himself of the suspicion of heresy. He returned to Basel, and received a reversal (22 March 1732) of the previous decision, and re-admission to all his clerical offices. But, on his becoming a candidate for the Hebrew chair at Basel, his orthodox opponents blocked his appointment, and he retired to Amsterdam.\n\nAt length, he was allowed to instruct the Remonstrant students in philosophy and Hebrew on certain humiliating conditions. For the rest of his life he continued as professor in the Remonstrant college, declining in 1745 the Greek chair at Basel. In 1746 he once more visited England, and collated Syriac manuscripts for his final, great work. At last this appeared in 1751–1752, in two folio volumes, under the title \"Novum Testamentum Graecum editionis receptae cum lectionibus variantibus codicum\" manuscripts, etc. He did not venture to put new readings in the body of his page, but consigned them to a place between the Textus Receptus and the full list of various readings. Beneath the latter he gave a commentary, consisting principally of a mass of valuable illustrations and parallels drawn from classical and rabbinical literature, which has formed a storehouse for all later commentators. In his \"Prolegomena\" he gave an admirable methodical account of the manuscripts, the versions and the readings of the fathers, as well as the troubled story of the difficulties with which he had had to contend in the prosecution of the work of his life. He was the first to designate uncial manuscripts by Roman capitals, and cursive manuscripts by Arabic figures. He did not long survive the completion of this work. He died in Amsterdam. \nWettstein rendered service to textual criticism by his collection of various readings and his methodical account of the manuscripts and other sources.\n\nThrough his laborious study of Codex Alexandrinus, he found misinterpretations or calculated mistakes of New Testament written in Greek that question the very basis of Christianity. For example, the misreading of Greek word \"God\" with \"who\", so the passage from the book of I Timothy no longer read: \"Christ as God made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit\", but instead read: \"Christ who was made manifest in the flesh, and justified in Spirit\". This finding, and some others led him to question his faith in the Divinity of Christ, which is evidenced by his later works.\n\nSome opponents considered his work to be less valuable because of his prejudice against the Latin version and the principle of grouping manuscripts in families which had been recommended by Richard Bentley and J. A. Bengel.\n\nSee Wettstein's account of his labours and trials in his \"Nov. Test. i.\": 1751. \"Novum Testamentum Græcum editionis receptæ, cum Lectionibus Variantibus Codicum MSS., Editionum aliarum, Versionum et Patrum, necnon Commentario pleniore ex Scriptoribus veteribus, Hebræis, Græcis, et Latinis, historiam et vim verborum illustrante\", in two volumes.

Her \"Revelations of Divine Love\", written around 1395, is the first book in the English language known to have been written by a woman. She is formally commemorated with a feast on 8 May in the Anglican Church, Episcopal Church, and Evangelical Lutheran Church. She has not yet been formally beatified or canonised in the Roman Catholic Church, so she is not currently in the \"Roman Martyrology\" or on the liturgical calendar of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. However, she is popularly venerated by Catholics as a holy woman of God, and is therefore at times referred to as \"Saint\", \"Blessed\", or \"Mother\" Julian.\n\nLittle is known about the life of Julian of Norwich (also known as Juliana) or her family. Even her name is uncertain; the name \"Julian\" is generally thought to be from the St. Julian's Church in Norwich, to which her anchorite's cell was joined, but \"Julian\" was a common name among women in the Middle Ages and could have originally belonged to either the anchoress or the church.\n\nJulian's writings indicate that she was probably born around 1342 and died around 1416. She may have been from a privileged (wealthy) family residing in or near Norwich, at the time the second largest city in England. At least one source considered it likely that she received her early education with the Benedictine nuns at nearby Carrow.\n\nPlague epidemics were rampant during the 14th century and, according to some scholars, Julian may have become an anchoress unmarried or, having lost her family in the plague, as a widow. Becoming an anchoress may have served as a way to quarantine her from the rest of the population. There is scholarly debate as to whether Julian was a nun in a nearby convent or a laywoman.\nWhen she was 30 and living at home, Julian suffered from a serious illness. Since she was presumed to be near death, her curate came to administer the last rites of the Catholic Church on 8May 1373. As part of the ritual, he held a crucifix in the air above the foot of her bed. Julian reported that she was losing her sight and felt physically numb, but as she gazed on the crucifix she saw the figure of Jesus begin to bleed. Over the next several hours, she had a series of sixteen visions of Jesus Christ, which ended by the time she recovered from her illness on 13May 1373. Julian wrote about her visions immediately after they had happened (although the text may not have been finished for some years), in a version of the \"Revelations of Divine Love\" often known as the \"Short Text\"; this narrative of 25 chapters is about 11,000 words long.\n\nTwenty to thirty years later, perhaps in the early 1390s, Julian began to write a theological exploration of the meaning of the visions, known as \"The Long Text\", which consists of 86 chapters and about 63,500 words. This work seems to have gone through many revisions before it was finished, perhaps in the 1410s or even the 1420s.\n\nThe English mystic Margery Kempe, whose autobiography is thought to be the first written in English, mentioned going to Norwich to speak with \"Dame Julian\" in around 1414.\n\nAdam Easton's \"Defense of St Birgitta\", Alfonso of Jaen's \"Epistola Solitarii\", and William Flete's \"Remedies against Temptations\", are all referred to in Julian's text.\n\nJulian was known as a spiritual authority within her community, where she also served as a counsellor and advisor.\n\nThe \"Short Text\" survives in only one manuscript, the mid-15th century Amherst Manuscript, which was copied from an original written in 1413 in Julian’s lifetime. The \"Short Text\" does not appear to have been widely read and was not edited until 1911.\n\nThe \"Long Text\" appears to have been slightly better known, but still does not seem to have been widely circulated in late medieval England. The one surviving manuscript from this period is the mid- to late-15th century \"Westminster Manuscript\", which contains a portion of the \"Long Text\" (not naming Julian as its author), refashioned as a didactic treatise on contemplation. The surviving manuscripts of the whole \"Long Text\" fall into two groups, with slightly different readings. On the one hand, there exists the late 16th century \"Brigittine Long Text\" manuscript, produced in exile in the Antwerp region and now known as the \"Paris Manuscript\". The other set of readings may be found in two manuscripts, now in the British Library's Sloane Collection. It is believed these nuns had an original, perhaps a holograph, manuscript of the \"Long Text\" written in Julian's Norwich dialect, which was written out and preserved in the Cambrai and Paris houses of the English Benedictine nuns in exile in the mid-17th century.\n\nThe first printed version of the \"Revelations\" was edited by a Benedictine, Serenus Cressy, in 1670. It was reprinted in 1843, 1864 and again in 1902. Modern interest in the text increased with the 1877 publication of a new edition of the \"Long Text\" by Henry Collins. An important moment was the publication of Grace Warrack's 1901 version of the book, with its \"sympathetic informed introduction\" and modernised language, which introduced most early 20th century readers to Julian's writings. Following the publication of the Warrack edition, Julian's name spread rapidly and she became a topic in many lectures and writings. Many editions of the works have been published in the last forty years (see below for further details), with translations into French (five times), German (four times), Italian, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Catalan, Greek and Russian.\n\n\"Revelations\" is a celebrated work in Roman Catholicism and Anglicanism because of the clarity and depth of Julian's visions of God. Julian of Norwich is now recognised as one of England's most important mystics.\n\nFor Denys Turner the core issue Julian addresses in \"Revelations of Divine Love\" is \"the problem of sin\". Julian says that sin is \"behovely\", which is often translated as \"necessary\", \"expedient\", or \"appropriate\". A more nuanced reading relates it to the scholastics \"conveniēns\" or \"fitting\".\n\nJulian came to such a sense of the awfulness of sin that she reckoned the pains of hell are to be chosen in preference to it. \"And to me was shown no harder hell than sin. For a kind soul has no hell but sin.\" Julian believed that sin was necessary because it brings people to self-knowledge, which leads to acceptance of the role of God in their life. Julian describes how God suffers with his creation as it experiences great and multifaceted evil.\n\nJulian lived in a time of turmoil, but her theology was optimistic and spoke of God's omnibenevolence and love in terms of joy and compassion. \"Revelations of Divine Love\" \"contains a message of optimism based on the certainty of being loved by God and of being protected by his Providence.\"\n\nThe most characteristic element of her mystical theology was a daring likening of divine love to motherly love, a theme found in the Biblical prophets, as in Isaiah49:15. According to Julian, God is both our mother and our father. As Caroline Walker Bynum showed, this idea was also developed by Bernard of Clairvaux and others from the 12thcentury onward. Some scholars think this is a metaphor rather than a literal belief. In her fourteenth revelation, Julian writes of the Trinity in domestic terms, comparing Jesus to a mother who is wise, loving and merciful. F.Beer asserted that Julian believed that the maternal aspect of Christ was literal and not metaphoric: Christ is not like a mother, he is literally the mother. Julian emphasized this by explaining how the bond between mother and child is the only earthly relationship that comes close to the relationship a person can have with Jesus. She also wrote metaphorically of Jesus in connection with conception, nursing, labour, and upbringing, but saw him as our brother as well.\nShe wrote, \"For I saw no wrath except on man's side, and He forgives that in us, for wrath is nothing else but a perversity and an opposition to peace and to love.\" She wrote that God sees us as perfect and waits for the day when human souls mature so that evil and sin will no longer hinder us. \"God is nearer to us than our own soul,\" she wrote. This theme is repeated throughout her work: \"Jesus answered with these words, saying: 'All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well.' . . . This was said so tenderly, without blame of any kind toward me or anybody else.\"\n\nAlthough Julian's views were not typical, the authorities might not have challenged her theology because of her status as an anchoress. A lack of references to her work during her own time may indicate that the religious authorities did not count her worthy of refuting, since she was an obscure woman.\n\nJulian's feast day in the Roman Catholic tradition (by popular celebration) is on 13 May, and on 8 May in the Anglican and Lutheran traditions.\n\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church quotes Julian of Norwich when it explains the Catholic viewpoint that, in the mysterious designs of Providence, God can draw a greater good even from evil: \"Here I was taught by the grace of God that I should steadfastly keep me in the faith... and that at the same time I should take my stand on and earnestly believe in what our Lord shewed in this time—that 'all manner [of] thing shall be well.'\"\n\nIn 1997, Father Giandomenico Mucci, S.J. reported that Julian of Norwich is on the waiting list to be declared a Doctor of the Church. In light of her established veneration, it is possible she will first be given an \"equivalent canonization\" to formally recognise her as a saint the way Saint Hildegard of Bingen was by Pope Benedict XVI in 2012.\n\nPope Benedict XVI dedicated his General Audience catechesis of 1 December 2010 to Julian of Norwich.\nPoet T. S. Eliot incorporated the saying that \"…All shall be well, and all shall be well, and all manner of thing shall be well\", as well as Julian's \"the ground of our beseeching\" from the 14th Revelation, into \"Little Gidding\", the fourth of his \"Four Quartets\":\n\nIn 1981 Sydney Carter wrote the song \"Julian of Norwich\" (sometimes called \"The Bells of Norwich\"), based on words of Julian.\n\nThe University of East Anglia honoured Julian in 2013 by naming the new study centre (with a 280-seat lecture theatre, seminar rooms, and adherence to high ecological standards) the \"Julian Study Centre\".\n\nEach year, beginning in 2013, there has been a week-long celebration of Julian of Norwich in her home city of Norwich, England organised by The Julian Centre. With concerts, lectures, workshops, and tours, the week aims to educate all interested people about Julian of Norwich, presenting her as a cultural, historical, literary, spiritual, and religious figure of international significance.\n\nIn recent decades a number of new editions, and renderings into modern English, of her \"Revelations of Divine Love\", have appeared, as well as publications about her. The revival of interest in her has been associated with a renewed interest in the English-speaking world in Christian contemplation. One association of contemplative prayer groups, The Julian Meetings, is named after her.\n\nEditions: \n\nTranslations:\n\n\n\n\n"}

For almost twenty years, he was Professor of Economics and Public Administration at the University of Puerto Rico. He described himself as a \"philosophical anarchist.\" His most influential work was \"The Breakdown of Nations\".\n\nKohr grew up in the small town of Oberndorf near Salzburg, and it remained his ideal of community. He often commented on the fact that the Christmas carol \"Silent Night\" was written and composed as \"Stille Nacht\" in his home village. He earned doctorate degrees in law, at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, and political science, at the University of Vienna. He also studied economics and political theory at the London School of Economics.\n\nIn 1937, Kohr became a freelance correspondent during the Spanish Civil War, where he was impressed by the limited, self-contained governments of the separatist states of Catalonia and Aragon, as well as the small Spanish anarchist city-states of Alcoy and Caspe. He became a close friend of journalist George Orwell and shared offices with correspondents Ernest Hemingway and André Malraux.\n\nKohr fled Austria in 1938 after it was annexed by Nazi Germany and emigrated to the United States. He later became an American citizen.\n\nKohr taught economics and political philosophy at Rutgers University, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, from 1943 to 1955. From 1955 to 1973, he was professor of Economics and Public Administration in the University of Puerto Rico, in San Juan, except for a period in 1965-66 when he was professor of Economics at the University of the Americas in Mexico City, Mexico; during these years he developed his concepts of village renewal and traffic calming, and \"lent his advice to local city planning initiatives.\" He also advised the independence movement of the nearby island of Anguilla.\n\nAfter many rejections by American and British publishers, Kohr's first book, \"The Breakdown of Nations\", was published in 1957 in Britain after a chance meeting with anarchist Sir Herbert Read.\n\nKohr moved from Puerto Rico to Wales, where he taught political philosophy at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth from 1968 until 1977. The project of Welsh independence, founded on the ideal of 'cymdeithas' (community) was dear to him, and Kohr became a mentor to Plaid Cymru and a close friend of its then leader, Gwynfor Evans. After retiring from teaching, Kohr divided his time between Gloucester, England, and Hellbrunn, outside Salzburg.\n\nIn 1983, in Stockholm, Sweden, Kohr received the Right Livelihood Award, \"for his early inspiration of the movement for a human scale.\" In 1984, Salzburg created the Leopold Kohr Academy and Cultural Association \"Tauriska\" to put his theories of regional autonomy into practice.\n\nKohr was planning to return to his hometown of Oberndorf to live when he died in 1994. His ashes were buried in Oberndorf. Salzburg journalist Gerald Lehner completed a biography of Kohr, based in part on long audiotaped interviews, in 1994.\n\nKohr was a charming conversationalist and a witty, elegant debunker of popular assumptions. Author Ivan Illich describes him as \"a funny bird—meek, fey, droll, and incisive\", as well as \"unassuming\" and even \"radically humble.\"\n\nKohr described himself as a \"philosophical anarchist.\" Kohr protested the \"cult of bigness\" and economic growth and promoted the concept of human scale and small community life. He argued that massive external aid to poorer nations stifled local initiatives and participation. His vision called for a dissolution of centralized political and economic structures in favor of local control.\n\nIn his first published essay \"Disunion Now: A Plea for a Society based upon Small Autonomous Units\", published in Commonweal in 1941, Kohr wrote about a Europe at war: \"We have ridiculed the many little states, now we are terrorized by their few successors.\" He called for the breakup of Europe into hundreds of city states. Kohr developed his ideas in a series of books, including \"The Breakdown of Nations\" (1957), \"Development without Aid\" (1973) and \"The Overdeveloped Nations\" (1977).\n\nFrom Leopold Kohr's most popular work \"The Breakdown of Nations\":\n\n... there seems to be only one cause behind all forms of social misery: bigness. Oversimplified as this may seem, we shall find the idea more easily acceptable if we consider that bigness, or oversize, is really much more than just a social problem. It appears to be the one and only problem permeating all creation. Whenever something is wrong, something is too big. ... And if the body of a people becomes diseased with the fever of aggression, brutality, collectivism, or massive idiocy, it is not because it has fallen victim to bad leadership or mental derangement. It is because human beings, so charming as individuals or in small aggregations, have been welded into overconcentrated social units.\n\nKohr was an important inspiration to the Green, bioregional, Fourth World, decentralist, and anarchist movements, Kohr contributed often to John Papworth's `Journal for the Fourth World', Resurgence. One of Kohr's students was economist E. F. Schumacher, another prominent influence on these movements, whose best selling book \"Small Is Beautiful\" took its title from one of Kohr's core principles. Similarly, his ideas inspired Kirkpatrick Sale's books \"Human Scale\" (1980) and \"Dwellers in the Land: The Bioregional Vision\" (1985). Sale arranged the first American publication of \"The Breakdown of Nations\" in 1978 and wrote the foreword.\n\n\n\n"}

Moral courage therefore involves deliberation or careful thought. Reflex action or dogmatic fanaticism do not involve moral courage because such impulsive actions are not based upon moral reasoning.\n\nMoral courage may also require physical courage when the consequences are punishment or other bodily peril.\n\nMoral courage has been seen as the exemplary modernist form of courage.\n\nParenting with the incorporation of moral courage can have an effect on the gender roles and self-expression of young adolescents. For example, young girls who conform to society's interpretation of women being passive.<ref name=\"Parenting/Gender Roles\"></ref> Both the parents and children engage in moral courage from different standpoints. The development of moral courage within parenting looks at not only on the parent's passed down moral values but the children's autonomy on how to perceive and practice their moral values. Those who incorporate the practice of their morals values into their everyday lives engage in moral courage to protect those values as well. Therefore, this parenting approach with practice of moral courage demonstrates a relationship between how parents morally raise their children and how the children choose to act based on their learned moral values.\n\nIn a workplace, LGBT employees can experience behaviors or actions of discriminating nature as well as violent hate crimes. As sexual and gender identity minorities, the LGBT employees express a need for straight or heterosexual allies in the workplace to go to as a resource.\n\nA research study was performed using qualitative research methods to analyze the process of how and individuals become LGBT allies. The study mentions how human resources development play a role in this matter. Human resources development professionals have the responsibility and the power to incorporate what LGBT employees desire in a workplace: inclusion, safety, and equal treatment with heterosexual employees.\n\nMoral courage distinguishes the abilities of a heterosexual LGBT ally and a human resources development professional. While heterosexual LGBT allies, acting on their moral values provide support and stand up for their LGBT colleagues, human resource development professionals and their positions in the workplace translates their values into action which translates into movement for change regarding LGBT discrimination.\n\n"}

A form of polyamory, contemporary arrangements are sometimes identified as a throuple or thruple.\n\nHistory has a number of examples of \"ménages à trois\" relationships.\n\nSpeculation exists that, in 1547–48, Queen Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII, and her fourth husband Thomas Seymour were involved in a \"ménage\" with the future Queen Elizabeth. This is probably exaggerated, although episodes of sexually charged horseplay involving the three were well attested.\n\nIn his youth, thirteen years her junior, the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was a of the French noblewoman Françoise-Louise de Warens, who would become his first lover. He lived with her at her estate on and off since his teenage years, and in 1732, after he reached the age of 20, she initiated a sexual relationship with him while also being open about her sexual involvement with the steward of her house.\n\nThe German intellectual Dorothea von Rodde-Schlözer, her husband Mattheus Rodde and the French philosopher Charles de Villers also had a \"ménage à trois\" from 1794 until her husband's death in 1810.\n\nSir William Hamilton (British ambassador to Naples), his wife Emma Hamilton, and her lover, the naval hero Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson, were in a \"ménage à trois\" from 1799 until Nelson's death in 1805. \n\nAt the age of 16, in 1813, the future author of Frankenstein, Mary Godwin, eloped with her to-be husband Percy Bysshe Shelley and engaged in a \"ménage\" with Claire Clairmont, future lover of Lord Byron, with whom the Shelleys would later have an extensive relationship.\n\nThe political philosopher Friedrich Engels lived in a \"ménage à trois\" with his mistress Mary Burns and her sister Lizzie.\n\nIn 1882 the Russian-born psychoanalyst and author Lou Andreas-Salomé invited the German philosophers Friedrich Nietzsche and Paul Rée to live with her, both of whom were in love with her. She kept her relationship with the two men celibate. Later she married a third man, Friedrich Carl Andreas, with whom she was also celibate.\n\nThe author E. Nesbit lived with her husband Hubert Bland and his mistress Alice Hoatson, and raised their children as her own.\n\nIn 1913, psychoanalyst Carl Jung began a relationship with a young patient, Toni Wolff, which lasted for some decades. Deirdre Bair, in her biography of Carl Jung, describes his wife Emma Jung as bearing up nobly as her husband insisted that Toni Wolff become part of their household, saying that Wolff was \"his other wife\".\n\nThe Russian and Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky lived with Lilya Brik, who was considered his muse, and her husband Osip Brik, an \"avant garde\" writer and critic.\n\nThe writer Aldous Huxley and his first wife Maria engaged in a \"ménage\" with Mary Hutchinson, a friend of Clive Bell.\n\nFrom 1939, Erwin Schrödinger, his wife Annemarie Bertel, and his mistress Hilde March had a \"ménage à trois\". \n\nIn 1963 the actress Hattie Jacques lived with her husband John Le Mesurier and her lover John Schofield.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1238401", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1238401", "title": "Parallel Lives", "text": "Parallel Lives\n\nPlutarch's Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans, commonly called Parallel Lives or Plutarch's Lives, is a series of biographies of famous men, arranged in tandem to illuminate their common moral virtues or failings, probably written at the beginning of the second century AD. The surviving \"Parallel Lives\" (Greek: Βίοι Παράλληλοι, \"Bíoi Parállēloi\") comprises 23 pairs of biographies, each pair consisting of one Greek and one Roman, as well as four unpaired, single lives. It is a work of considerable importance, not only as a source of information about the individuals described, but also about the times in which they lived.\n\nAs he explains in the first paragraph of his \"Life of Alexander\", Plutarch was not concerned with writing histories, but with exploring the influence of character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of famous men. He wished to prove that the more remote past of Greece could show its men of action and achievement as well as the nearer, and therefore more impressive, past of Rome. His interest was primarily ethical, although the lives have significant historical value as well. The \"Lives\" was published by Plutarch late in his life after his return to Chaeronea and, if one may judge from the long lists of authorities given, it must have taken many years to compile.\n\nThe chief manuscripts of the \"Lives\" date from the 10th and 11th centuries, and the first printed edition appeared in Rome in 1470. Thomas North's 1579 English translation was an important source-material for Shakespeare. Jacob Tonson printed several editions of the \"Lives\" in English in the late 17th century, beginning with a five-volume set printed in 1688, with subsequent editions printed in 1693, 1702, 1716, and 1727. The most generally accepted text is that of the minor edition of Carl Sintenis in the \"Bibliotheca Teubneriana\" (five volumes, Leipzig 1852-1855; reissued without much change in 1873–1875). There are annotated editions by I. C. Held, E. H. G. Leopold, Otto Siefert and Friedrich Blass and Carl Sintenis, all in German; and by Holden, in English.\n\nSeveral of the lives, such as those of Epaminondas and Scipio Africanus, are lost, and many of the remaining lives are truncated, contain obvious lacunae and/or have been tampered with by later writers.\n\nPlutarch's \"Life of Alexander\" is one of the few surviving secondary or tertiary sources about Alexander the Great, and it includes anecdotes and descriptions of incidents that appear in no other source. Likewise, his portrait of Numa Pompilius, an early Roman king, contains unique information about the early Roman calendar.\n\nPlutarch has been criticized for his lack of judicious discrimination in his use of authorities, and consequent errors and inaccuracies, but he gives an abundance of citations and, incidentally, a large number of valuable pieces of information, which fill up numerous gaps in historical knowledge obtained elsewhere. He has been praised for the liveliness and warmth of his portrayals, and his moral earnestness and enthusiasm, and the \"Lives\" have attracted a large circle of readers throughout the ages.\nPlutarch's \"Life of Romulus\" is a significant source of the Roman foundation myth.\n\nPlutarch adds details to the royal scandal behind the infant Romulus and Remus' abandonment in the wilderness. He quotes Diocles of Peparethus and Pictor in writing that when Numitor and Amulius stood to inherit the throne, the twins' great-grandfather gave his sons a choice between the throne and the treasures that had been brought back from Troy. Numitor chose the throne, but when he was overthrown, he ended up with neither. Along with the two names mentioned by Livy for the twins' mother, Plutarch tells us she may also have been named Ilia. The boys were the issue of Amulius himself, who raped his niece while wearing his armor. Upon the discovery of her pregnancy, her cousin Antho, the king's daughter convinced him to spare her life. He suggests that Faustulus may have been the name of the servant charged with the drowning of the twins, as opposed to their adopted father. He names the site where the boys are brought back to dry land by Tibernius as Kermalus, formerly Germanus (from the Latin word for twin).\n\nIn addition to the common tale, Plutarch relates a version from Dionysius where the twins' mother was Larentia, a woman famous for her beauty, and their father Hercules. She was forced to spend the night with the hero as his reward for winning a dice game with the keeper of his temple. In the morning, he threw her out and told her to befriend the first man she meets. He was Tarrutius, a wealthy elderly childless bachelor. They slept together, ended up marrying and were together until his death. Faustulus was, in this account, in the employ of Amulius. The basket in which they were abandoned bore a bronze inscription of their names and was kept by Faustulus, however, the inscription had worn off, but it was hoped that it might be used to determine their true parents.\n\nNumitor and others possibly knew the secret of the twins origin and Numitor had them educated in Gabii. Romulus was the more dominant of the two. They were defiant toward the authorities and instead of being highwaymen preying on other thieves, here they were portrayed as vigilante protectors of their neighbors. In a story from Caius Ancilius, on one occasion, the twins had lost their flock and had set out after them naked so their sweat wouldn't slow them down. Because they were guided by Faunus, the god of nature, this inspired the later festivals.\n\nA dispute between herdsmen loyal to Numitor and Amulius is at the heart of this version. The twins sided with Amulius. Remus was captured when Romulus was elsewhere. When Faustulus learned that Remus has been taken to Numitor, he went to Alba with the basket in which the infant twins were abandoned. It bore a copper plate with an engraving that had long been effaced. He was stopped by the city guards at the gate. The servant charged with abandoning the twins happened to be present and saw the basket, immediately going to inform the king. When brought before Amulius, Faustulus tries to fool the king by telling him the twins were alive elsewhere and the basket was being brought to their mother Ilia.\n\nCiting Fabius and Diocles, Plutarch writes that Amulius sent a man close to Numitor to ask if he had had any word that the twins were alive. However, when he arrived, he saw Remus and Numitor together and warned them. They incited the people against the king just as Romulus arrived with an army of supporters to attack the city. The king was promptly overwhelmed and killed.\n\nPlutarch claims that many slaves and fugitives were already following the twins when they set forth and were motivated by the Alban unwillingness to allow their cohorts to remain. He adds that some sources indicate that Romulus lied about the 12 birds he saw during the contest with Remus. Remus was killed either by his brother, or Celer, Romulus' man, who then fled to Tuscany with so much haste that his name became the Latin word for speed. Also killed was Faustulus' brother Pleistinus.\n\nIn the account of the Battle of the Lacas Curtius, the Roman line broke not because of Hostilius' death, but because Romulus was struck by a stone to the head. He rallied the men after recovering. When the women intervened to stop the fighting, some of them had children in their arms. The women not only ended the battle, but brought food and water, cared for the injured and introduced their husbands to their fathers. It was agreed that the Sabine women had no duty but to spin for their husbands from then on.\n\nAccording to Plutarch, the two kings were in full agreement on all except one: the royal response to the crime committed by members of Tatius' relatives against the Laurentian ambassadors. Some of Tatius' relatives killed a group of ambassadors from Laurentium when their attempt to rob them went wrong. Romulus wanted to punish the men with death promptly, and Tatius did not. Later, while sacrificing with Romulus in Lativium, friends of the ambassadors attacked and killed Tatius, but spared Romulus, praising his sense of fairness.\n\nTatius was given a royal burial, however Plutarch reports that there were no efforts to punish his killers. He cites one source that claims that the assassins were brought by Laurentium authorities to Romulus but he declined to punish them. Rome was later visited by a series of plagues, and when it spread to Laurentuim, it was thought to be a result of the injustice in the death of Tatius and the ambassadors. Both cities brought to justice the parties involved in the two attacks, and Romulus performed rites to purify the cities.\n\nRome was weakened by the plague and this prompted Camerium to invade. In one version of the war with Fidenae, Romulus did not raze the city, but instead declared it a colony and sent 2500 Romans to live there.\n\nPlutarch recounts several versions of the death. In one, he died peacefully after a long illness. In another, he committed suicide by poison. He recounts two versions wherein he died violently, either by assassins who smothered him at home during the night, or by senators who lured him to the Temple of Vulcan where they killed and dismembered him and each disposed of a small part of his corpse, hidden in their robes. He details the motivations of the senate, saying there was anger toward his demeanor toward them and disregard toward their legal sovereignty in diplomacy and legal proceedings.\n\nIn the version cited by Livy, the gods themselves were suggested to have intervened. He retells one variant wherein the emotions of the public were assuaged not only by the oath of Proculus Julius to have seen the deified king, but also by an apparently divine force that quieted the anger and suspicions toward the nobles. It descended upon the city and the Romans accepted and worshiped Romulus as Quirinus. Romulus was 54 years old when he disappeared.\n\nPlutarch structured his \"Lives\" by alternating lives of famous Greeks with those of famous Romans. After such a set of two (and one set of four) lives he generally writes out a comparison of the preceding biographies. The table below links to several English translations of Plutarch's \"Lives\" available online; see also \"Other links\" section below. The LacusCurtius site has the complete set; the others are incomplete to varying degrees. There are also four paperbacks published by Penguin Books, two with Greek lives, two Roman, rearranged in chronological order and containing a total of 36 of the lives.\n\nDryden is famous for having lent his name as editor-in-chief to the first \"complete\" English translation of Plutarch's \"Lives\".

In 1895, George Wyndham wrote that the first rank consists of the biographies of Themistocles, Alcibiades, Marius, Cato, Alexander, Demetrius, Antonius, and Pompey. Peter D'Epiro praised Plutarch's depiction of Alcibiades as \"a masterpiece of characterization.\" Academic Philip A. Stadter singled out Pompey and Caesar as the greatest figures in the Roman biographies.\n\n"}
{"id": "32996853", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=32996853", "title": "Philosopher in Meditation", "text": "Philosopher in Meditation\n\nPhilosopher in Meditation (Bredius 431) is the traditional title of an oil painting in the Musée du Louvre, Paris, that has long been attributed to the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt.\n\nIt is signed \"RHL-van Rijn\" and dated 1632, at the time of Rembrandt's move from Leiden to Amsterdam. Recent scholarship suggests that the painting depicts \"Tobit and Anna waiting for their son Tobias\" instead. This interpretation appears in the first known source, an auction catalogue from 1738 (see \"Subject matter\").\n\nThe painting appeared in Paris around the middle of the 18th century and made the rounds of aristocratic collections before being acquired for the royal collections housed in the Louvre Palace. The presumed subject matter, the finely graded chiaroscuro treatment and intricate composition were widely appreciated in France and the painting is mentioned in the writings of many 19th- and 20th-century literary figures, including George Sand, Théophile Gautier, Jules Michelet, Marcel Proust, Paul Valéry, Gaston Bachelard, Paul Claudel, and Aldous Huxley.\n\nThe popularity of the painting may be measured by its presence on the internet, where it is often used as an emblem of philosophy, or interpreted along esoteric or occult lines.\n\nPainted in oils on an oak panel measuring about 11 x 13 in. (28 x 34 cm), the painting depicts in slightly accelerated perspective two figures in a partially vaulted interior that is dominated by a wooden spiral staircase. The architecture includes stone, brick and wood, with arched elements (window, vault, doors) that create an impression of monumentality. On the pre-iconographic level, this is one of the most \"graphic\" works painted by Rembrandt, in the sense that it contains many straight, curved, circular, and radiating lines: from the lines of the flagstones to those of the window, the bricks, the wainscotting, and of course the staircase. As in the staircase and the basketwork tray at the center of the composition, the curved lines can be said to organize the straight lines. The first figure is that of an old man seated at a table in front of a window, his head bowed and his hands folded in his lap. The second figure is that of an old woman tending a fire in an open hearth. A third figure—a woman standing in the stairs carrying a basket and turned to the spectator—is visible in 18th- and 19th-century engraved reproductions of the painting, but virtually invisible in the painting's present state. As it is, the overall painting is quite dark due to the aging of the varnish.\n\nThe panel is signed \"RHL-van Rijn 163_\" at the bottom and left of the center, at a vertical from the figure of the old man. The signature is traced in light pigment on a dark background and is quite difficult to make out. The last digit is a tiny blob of paint, the form and placing of which would tally with a \"0,\" \"1\" or \"2.\" The type of signature—monogram plus patronymic—would argue for 1632, for the artist used this type of signature only in this year. This does not mean that the picture was painted in that year or even in Amsterdam, to which Rembrandt had moved in late 1631. In any case, this type of signature is so rare in Rembrandt's oeuvre and date-specific that it argues for authenticity.\n\nWhile the traditional title Philosopher in Meditation has to a large extent been responsible for the painting's popularity, it is iconographically untenable. The painting shows none of the conspicuous attributes of scholarship or philosophy—books, globe, scientific instruments, etc.—and the presence of at least one other figure involved in domestic tasks does not fit in with the solitude associated with study and meditation. Though a large book and a quill seem to be among the few objects on the table in front of the main figure, they are summarily depicted and impossible to identify more precisely: a Bible alone would not suffice to make the figure depicted a scholar or \"philosopher.\" Staircases—whether spiral or not—were not an attribute of philosophy in the early 17th century. Similar observations argue against identifying the main figure as an \"alchemist,\" a subject that would allow for other figures, such as an assistant tending a fire. The objects depicted suggest a domestic setting, yet the improbable architecture speaks more for a history than a genre subject. The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke argues that the scene is ultimately derived from the Book of Tobit, one of Rembrandt's favorite Old Testament sources. The sole objection to this interpretation is that, apart from the two main figures—the blind Tobit and his wife Anna— there is no identifying attribute, such as Anna's spinning wheel. Nevertheless, a plausible interpretation of the scene is Tobit and Anna waiting for the return of their only son, Tobias, a scene that Rembrandt had already represented in another version in 1630. This is supported by an 18th-century source identifying a painting of the same dimensions by Rembrandt representing a \"Composition with Tobit and a winding stair.\" Earlier inventory mentions of a \"winding stair with an old man sitting on a chair\" or \"winding stair\" attributed to Rembrandt are vague and might even refer to the companion painting long attributed to Rembrandt, but now given to Salomon Koninck.\nAlthough the title in the Louvre's publications remains \"Philosophe en méditation\", catalogues of Rembrandt's painted oeuvre, starting with Bredius (1935) identify the subject more soberly as a \"Scholar in an Interior with a Winding Stair.\" With the rejection of the attribution to Rembrandt by the Rembrandt Research Project in 1986, the title became \"Old Man in an interior with a winding staircase.\"\n\nThe best explanation for the long-standing misinterpretation of the \"Philosopher in Meditation\" lies in the fact that, in the middle of the 18th century, it was sold together with a pendant of identical size (28 x 33.5 cm) that presented similar motifs—including a spiral staircase—and that was also attributed to Rembrandt. The paintings were exhibited together and titled interchangeably \"Philosophe en méditation\" and \"Philosophe en contemplation\", or referred to simply as the \"Philosophes\". The companion painting shows an old man in a vaulted interior seated in front of a table at a window on which we can see books, a globe, and a crucifix. These objects and his solitude make him a much better candidate for philosophical endeavor than the old man in the alleged \"Philosopher in Meditation\". In spite of the obvious differences in the composition and execution, no one called its attribution to Rembrandt in doubt. The great exception is the American art historian John C. Van Dyke, who whittled Rembrandt's oeuvre down to less than fifty paintings and made short shrift of the Louvre's \"Philosophers\": \"Small pictures over which, in the past, there has been much spilling of good printer's ink with no marked results. The pictures are not wonderful...\". In 1955, examinations with X-rays and infrared photography at the laboratory of the Louvre revealed notable differences in treatment and caused this attribution to be dropped. Jacques Foucart (1982), Curator for Dutch and Fleming Painting at the Louvre, like Horst Gerson (1968) and Werner Sumowski (1983), attributes this work to Salomon Koninck (1609–1656), a Rembrandt imitator, dating it to around 1645 and titling it \"Philosopher in Contemplation\" or \"Philosopher with an Open Book\". Yet the real credit for the attribution to Koninck should go to John C. Van Dyke, who wrote: \"In fact, one may be heretical enough to think that someone like Koninck or Dou may have painted them...\" The subject matter and details of the Koninck picture seem to have been directly inspired by a Rembrandt etching dated 1642 and representing \"St. Jerome in a dark chamber\" (Bartsch 105), which is the only other known work by Rembrandt that features a complete helical staircase. The traditional iconography of the Doctors of the Church and St. Jerome in particular provided the attributes for 17th-century representations of scholars in their study. In the last analysis, the only thing that the pendant has in common with the \"Philosopher in Meditation\" is the medium and format, which reflects more on Koninck's intentions than on those of Rembrandt. Any further speculation on the relationship between the two paintings must take into account a manuscript commentary from around 1750 by their first French owner, the marquis de Voyer d'Argenson, who states that the two pictures were brought together \"by chance.\"\n\nIn the second volume of its \"Corpus of Rembrandt Paintings\", which covers the years 1631-1634, the Rembrandt Research Project (RRP) rejected the attribution to Rembrandt of the \"Philosopher in Meditation\". Until then, and except for the \"heretical\" John C. Van Dyke, this attribution had been unanimously accepted by experts and art historians. The RRP did not introduce any new objective or documentary evidence, but based its judgment on an assessment of Rembrandt's \"habits,\" an appraisal of the painting's style, and the difficulty of fitting it within Rembrandt's production in 1632 or the later 1630s. The RRP did not make any guesses as to who the author of this painting might have been, but relegated it to \"Rembrandt's immediate circle, or even his own workshop.\" This judgment was analyzed by Jean-Marie Clarke who pointed out, among other things, that the RRP may have had a special stake in rejecting this painting, as the following quote suggests:\n\"In the later part of the 18th century the painting enjoyed a great reputation in France as \"Le Philosophe en contemplation\", and it helped to determine the image of Rembrandt's art to an unwarranted extent.\"\nThis disattribution was not accepted by the Louvre and other Rembrandt scholars, and the newly configured RRP has changed its stance since. In the fifth volume of the \"Corpus\" (2011), which covers \"small history paintings,\" the painting has been classified without further ado as a \"re-attribution\" by the current director of the RRP, Ernst van de Wetering. The painting was officially re-instated in vol. 6 of the \"Corpus\" under no. 86 with the title \"Interior with a window and a winding staircase\" and the parenthetical information: \"a study in Kamerlicht.\"\n\nIn a lecture given at the Goetheanum in Dornach (1916), the ex-theosophist and founder of the Anthroposophical Society, Rudolf Steiner, described the Louvre \"Philosopher\" as the \"purest expression of light and dark... All that you see here—the architecture and all the other features—merely provided the occasion for the real work of Art, which lies in the distribution of light and dark.\" This, he held, was precisely the essence of Rembrandt's art. As it was, he showed only a \"lantern slide\" of the companion painting by Salomon Koninck discussed above.\nWith his inversion of the title, Aldous Huxley (1954) sums up most of the \"deeper\" interpretations of the painting: \"There hangs in the Louvre a \"Méditation du Philosophe\", whose symbolical subject-matter is nothing more or less than the human mind, with its teeming darknesses, its moments of intellectual and visionary illuminations, its mysterious staircases winding downwards and upwards into the unknown.\nThe caption to an illustration of the painting (reversed) in the psychoanalyst C. G. Jung's \"Man and His Symbols\" (1964) reads: \"The inward-looking old man provides an image of Jung's belief that each of us must explore his own unconscious.\"\n\nJean-Marie Clarke (1980) advanced a psychological interpretation based on the circular form of the composition and the Yin-Yang-like distribution of light, reading the painting as a \"Mandala\" in the Jungian sense: an archetypal symbol of the integrated Self. The chiaroscuro treatment and the presence of many straight lines that are structured by curved lines speaks for a deliberate effort at reconciling the Opposites. Further, Clarke interpreted the concentricity of the composition and wealth of circular motifs as metaphors for the underlying theme of the painting: the eye and vision. Like Julius Held, Clarke believes that the drawing dated ca. 1630 at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford (Benesch 64) with the caption \"HARMAN GERRITS van der Rhijn\" written in Rembrandt's hand that shows his father in a pose similar to that of Tobit here, suggests that he may have been blind at the end of his life. Accordingly, the figure of the blind old man (Tobit) stands for Rembrandt's father (d. 1630), who opposed his son's wish to become an artist and whose vision the young Rembrandt (Tobias) \"healed\" with the help of the archangel Raphael (\"God heals\", a name that also symbolizes Art). More recently, Clarke published an interpretation on the internet that relates Rembrandt's composition to the design of his signature in 1632.\n\nJean-Pierre Dautun (1983), a student of the French philosopher Raymond Abellio, offers a detailed phenomenological reading along Gnostic lines, interpreting the central motif of the painting (the basketwork tray) as \"the navel, the \"omphalos\" of the luminous hermetic secret that Rembrandt wishes to transmit: the phenomenological secret that the eye of the genius will be given to those who will conquer the genius of the eye. It is the ineffable secret of this transmission itself, the 'thou art that' of this \"mutus liber\" that is his painting, as if to permit an Occidental satori to a koan of his own devise.\" The French philosophy professor Régine Pietra (1992) published an essay in which she used the painting to illustrate the rhetorical figure of hypotyposis; Rembrandt's painting, with its interplay of light and dark, renders the experience of philosophical meditation visually perceptible.\nThe Dutch philosopher Otto B. Wiersma (1999) published an article on the internet that he summarizes in these terms:\n\"The painting of Rembrandt \"Philosophe en méditation\" (1632, Louvre Paris) can be characterized as a pictorial meditation on the miracle of vision. A better title would be \"Méditation visionnaire\", because the painting catches the eye in more than one sense.\"\nA discussion of the \"Philosopher in Meditation\" along essentially Gurdjeffian lines can be found on the Objective Art website (2011).\n\n"}
{"id": "37003", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37003", "title": "Prayer rope", "text": "Prayer rope\n\nA prayer rope ( - \"komboskini\"; - \"chotki\" (most common term) or - \"vervitsa\" (literal translation); ; Romanian: metanii / metanier; Serbian: бројаница / brojanica - \"broyanitsa\"; - \"broyenitsa\"; Coptic: - \"mequetaria/mequtaria\") is a loop made up of complex woven knots formed in a cross pattern, usually out of wool or silk. Prayer ropes are part of the practice of Eastern Orthodox and Eastern-Catholic monks and nuns and is employed by monastics (and sometimes by others) to count the number of times one has prayed the Jesus Prayer or, occasionally, other prayers. The typical prayer rope has thirty three knots, representing the thirty three years of Christ's life. Oriental Orthodoxy also uses the prayer rope, where it is known by its Coptic name.\n\nHistorically, the prayer rope would typically have 100 knots, although prayer ropes with 150, 50, or 33 knots can also be found in use today. There are even small, 10-knot prayer ropes intended to be worn on the finger. Hermits in their cells may have prayer ropes with as many as 300 or 500 knots in them.\n\nCharacteristically, the knots of a prayer rope are diamond knots (ABoK #787).\n\nThere is typically a knotted cross where the prayer rope is joined together to form a loop, and a few beads at certain intervals between the knots (usually every 10 or 25 knots) for ease in counting. Longer prayer ropes frequently have a tassel at the end of the cross; its purpose is to dry the tears shed due to heartfelt compunction for one's sins. The tassel can also be said to represent the glory of the Heavenly Kingdom, which one can only enter through the Cross. Additionally, the tassel represents an inherited tradition of prayer. The symbol of tassels as tradition coming from Old Testament commandments to Jews to wear tassels on their garments to keep in mind the received laws.\n\nThe prayer rope is commonly made out of wool, symbolizing the flock of Christ; though in modern times other materials are used also. The traditional color of the rope is black (symbolizing mourning for one's sins), with either black or colored beads. The beads (if they are colored) and at least a portion of the tassel are traditionally red, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the blood of the martyrs. In recent times, however, prayer ropes have been made in a wide variety of colors.\n\nThough prayer ropes are often tied by monastics, non-monastics are permitted to tie them also. In proper practice, the person tying a prayer rope should be of true faith and pious life and should be praying the Jesus Prayer the whole time.\n\nAccording to Orthodox Serbs, the 33 knotted prayer rope should be worn on the left hand, and when praying, held with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand. The 33 knots symbolize the age of Jesus Christ when he was crucified.\n\nAmong the Oriental Orthodox, the prayer rope is composed of 41, 64, or 100 beads and is primarily used to recite the Kyrie Eleison prayer as well as others such as the Lord's Prayer and the Magnificat. In regards to the first two numbers, the former represents the number lashes inflicted on Jesus (39 according to Jewish custom), the lance wound, and the crown of thorns, while the latter represents Mary's age upon her Assumption respectively.\n\nWhen praying, the user normally holds the prayer rope in the left hand, leaving the right hand free to make the Sign of the Cross. When not in use, the prayer rope is traditionally wrapped around the left wrist so that it continues to remind one to pray without ceasing. If this is impractical, it may be placed in the (left) pocket, but should not be hung around the neck or suspended from the belt. The reason for this is humility: one should not be ostentatious or conspicuous in displaying the prayer rope for others to see.\n\nDuring their tonsure (religious profession), Eastern Orthodox monks and nuns receive a prayer rope, with the words:\n\nAccept, O brother (sister) \"(name)\", the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God (Ephesians 6:17) in the everlasting Jesus prayer by which you should have the name of the Lord in your soul, your thoughts, and your heart, saying always: \"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me a sinner.\"\nOrthodoxy regards the prayer rope as the sword of the Spirit, because prayer which is heartfelt and inspired by the grace of the Holy Spirit is a weapon that defeats the Devil.\n\nAmong some Orthodox monastics (and occasionally other faithful), the canonical hours and preparation for Holy Communion may be replaced by praying the Jesus Prayer a specified number of times dependent on the service being replaced. In this way prayers can still be said even if the service books are for some reason unavailable or the person is not literate or otherwise unable to recite the service; the prayer rope becomes a very practical tool in such cases, simply for keeping count of the prayers said. However, among some monastics - hesychasts, for example - this replacement is the norm.\n\nOne scheme for replacing the Divine Services with the Jesus Prayer is as follows:\n\nOver the centuries, various cell rules have developed to help the individual in the daily use of the prayer rope. However, there is no single, standardized method in use universally throughout the Church. There may be prostrations after each prayer or after a certain number of prayers, depending upon the particular rule being followed.\n\nNot only is the Jesus Prayer used, but Eastern Christians also have many \"breath prayers\". Contrary to thought, they are not to be said using spiritual breathing, as that can only be determined by a spiritual father. Breath prayers continuously repeated on the prayer rope may include: Lord Have Mercy, Come Lord Jesus, Lord I Believe...Help My Unbelief, Lord Save Me, etc.\n\nAmong the Orthodox believers of Balkan countries, small 33 knot prayer ropes are frequently worn around the wrist. It is also common, though somewhat less so, to wear the larger 100 knot around the neck.\n\nThe history of the prayer rope goes back to the origins of Christian monasticism itself. When monks began going into the deserts of Egypt, it was their custom to pray the entire 150 Psalms every day. However, because some of the monks were unable to read, they would either have to memorize the psalms or perform other prayers and prostrations in their stead. Thus the tradition of saying 150 (or more) Jesus Prayers every day began.\n\nThe invention of the prayer rope is attributed to Pachomius the Great in the fourth century as an aid for illiterate monks to accomplish a consistent number of prayers and prostrations in their cells. Previously, monks would count their prayers by casting pebbles into a bowl, but this was cumbersome, and could not be easily carried about when outside the cell. The use of the rope made it possible to pray the Jesus Prayer unceasingly, whether inside the cell or out, in accordance with Paul the Apostle's injunction to \"Pray without ceasing\" (I Thessalonians 5:17).\n\nIt is said that the method of tying the prayer rope had its origins from the father of Orthodox monasticism, Anthony the Great. He started by tying a leather rope with a simple knot for every time he prayed Kyrie Eleison (\"Lord have Mercy\"), but the Devil would come and untie the knots to throw off his count. He then devised a way—inspired by a vision he had of the Theotokos—of tying the knots so that the knots themselves would constantly make the sign of the cross. This is why prayer ropes today are still tied using knots that each contain seven little crosses being tied over and over. The Devil could not untie it because the Devil is vanquished by the Sign of the Cross.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7200317", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7200317", "title": "Radical criticism", "text": "Radical criticism\n\nRadical criticism is a movement around the late 19th century that, typically, denied authentic authorship of the Pauline epistles. This went beyond the higher criticism of the Tübingen school which (with the exception of Bruno Bauer) held that a core of at least four epistles had been written by Paul of Tarsus in the 1st century.\n\nThe Dutch school of radical criticism started in 1878 with a publication by Allard Pierson, who denied Pauline authorship of Galatians. He was fiercely attacked by his colleague A. D. Loman, but two years later also Loman abandoned the historicity of Paul. Similarly, W.C. van Manen, who had written a doctoral thesis defending the authenticity of 1 Thessalonians, wrote in 1889 that he had come to the same conclusions as Loman. Also the philosopher G. J. P. J. Bolland was a part of this movement. With the death of Van Manen's student G. A. van den Bergh van Eysinga in 1957, this line of scholarship at Dutch universities came to an end.\n\nThe name \"Dutch Radicals\" was coined by A. D. Loman, in an 1887 article reviewing Edwin Johnson (\"Antiqua Mater: A Study of Christian Origins\", 1887), saying that \"the author is a radical like we seldom meet among theologians and hardly ever among English theologians\". The RadikalKritik article on \"van Manen and the Dutch Radicals\" adds that \"Van Manen later spoke of the 'radical' or the 'Dutch' school (1902). The 'radical' scholars did not want to be impeded by church canons and wanted to be free in their research of the New Testament and of the history of early Christianity. This research led them to the conclusion that we do not have any authentic Pauline epistles.\"\n\nThe Dutch school also influenced Rudolf Steck in Switzerland, and Arthur Drews in Germany. However, the works of Adolf Harnack proved more influential, and radical criticism was almost forgotten until it was unearthed by the \"Journal of Higher Criticism\" in the United States.\n\nIt is now richly documented in the RadikalKritik site managed by Dr. Hermann Detering, who is reviving the complete scholarship of Radical Criticism of the Dutch Radical School, with reviews of all its members and analyses of their works, including many articles in English.\n\nHermann Detering's site also follows current controversies from the US, such as the criticisms raised about Bart Ehrman's recent publication of \"Did Jesus Exist?\" (2012), and about the series of articles published by R. Joseph Hoffmann on his blog \"The New Oxonian\", called \"The Jesus Process: A Consultation on the Historical Jesus\".\n\nMembers of the Radical Dutch School argued against the existence of Jesus, this caused controversy. Robert Van Voorst has written that \"their\narguments were stoutly attacked in the Netherlands, especially by other scholars, but largely ignored out it.\"\n\n\n"}
{"id": "4070755", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4070755", "title": "Russell's teapot", "text": "Russell's teapot\n\nRussell's teapot is an analogy, formulated by the philosopher Bertrand Russell (1872–1970), to illustrate that the philosophic burden of proof lies upon a person making unfalsifiable claims, rather than shifting the burden of \"disproof\" to others. \n\nRussell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion. He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a teapot, too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. \n\nRussell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the existence of God, and has had influence in various fields and media.\n\nIn an article titled \"Is There a God?\" commissioned, but never published, by \"Illustrated\" magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:\n\nIn 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:\n\nChemist Peter Atkins said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. Occam's razor suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory. However, philosopher Paul Chamberlain says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not. He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like Mother Goose and the tooth fairy, the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that \"When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist.\"\n\nIn his books \"A Devil's Chaplain\" (2003) and \"The God Delusion\" (2006), geneticist Richard Dawkins used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed \"agnostic conciliation\", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters. Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a \"reductio ad absurdum\" of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.\n\nPhilosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist. Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: \"the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is.\"\n\nPhilosopher Peter van Inwagen argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent. Another philosopher, Alvin Plantinga states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:\n\nPhilosopher Gary Gutting rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.\n\nThe literary critic James Wood, without believing in God, says that belief in God \"is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot\" because God is a \"grand and big idea\" which \"is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur\" and \"because God cannot be reified, cannot be turned into a mere thing\".\n\nOne counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan, is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.\n\nOther thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as J. B. Bury in his 1913 book, \"History of Freedom of Thought\":\n\nSome people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.\n\nAstronomer Carl Sagan in his 1995 book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:\nNow, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?\n\nThe concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly religion-parodying concepts such as the Invisible Pink Unicorn and the Flying Spaghetti Monster. 1960s musician and psychedelic poet Daevid Allen of the band Gong employed the image of a flying teapot in his Planet Gong Universe and the \"Flying Teapot\" album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book \"Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories & Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975\".\n"}

The genesis of the term \"sadae\" arises in the work of the Chinese philosopher Mencius:\n\"Sadae\" describes a foreign policy characterized by the various ways a small country acknowledges the strength of a greater power like that of China. \"Sadae\" is made manifest in the actions of the weaker state as it conveys goodwill and respect through its envoys.\n\nThe utility of the \"sadae\" concept in Korea was recognized from the period of Three Kingdoms of Korea to 1895; and it is demonstrated in the relationship of mid-Joseon Korea towards the Ming Dynasty of China. The Joseon Dynasty made every effort to maintain a friendly relationship with Beijing for reasons having to do with realpolitik and with an idealized Confucian worldview. \"Sadae\" construes China as the center of a Confucian moral universe.\n\nAs a foundation of diplomacy, the Joseon kingdom presumed that the Korean state was positioned within a Sinocentristic milieu. The Joseon foreign policy was organized around maintaining stable Joseon-Chinese relations in the period from 1392 through 1895. The concept of \"sadae\" is contrasted with limited trade relationships or \"kyorin\" diplomacy (교린정책; \"lit.\" \"neighborly relations\") which marked Joseon-Japanese relations in this period.\n\nThe concept of \"sadae\" was rejected in the writings of polemicist Shin Chaeho and other Korean nationalists in the 20th century.

{"id": "1358357", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1358357", "title": "Tapas (Indian religions)", "text": "Tapas (Indian religions)\n\nTapas is a Sanskrit word that means \"to heat\". It also connotes certain spiritual practices in Indian religions. In Jainism, it refers to asceticism (austerities, body mortification); in Buddhism to spiritual practices including meditation and self-discipline; and in the different traditions within Hinduism it refers to a spectrum of practices ranging from asceticism, inner cleansing to self-discipline. The \"Tapas\" practice often involves solitude, and is a part of monastic practices that are believed to be a means to moksha (liberation, salvation).\n\nIn the Vedas literature of Hinduism, fusion words based on \"tapas\" are widely used to expound several spiritual concepts that develop through heat or inner energy, such as meditation, any process to reach special observations and insights, the spiritual ecstasy of a yogin or \"Tāpasa\" (a vṛddhi derivative meaning \"a practitioner of austerities, an ascetic\"), even warmth of sexual intimacy. In certain contexts, the term means penance, pious activity, as well as severe meditation.\n\n\"Tapas\" is based on the root \"Tap\" (तप्) meaning \"to heat, to give out warmth, to shine, to burn\". The term evolves to also mean \"to suffer, to mortify the body, undergo penance\" in order to \"burn away past karma\" and liberate oneself. The term \"Tapas\" means \"warmth, heat, fire\".\n\nThe meaning of the word evolves in ancient Indian literature. The earliest discussions of \"tapas\", and compound words from the root \"tap\" (Sanskrit: तप) relate to the heat necessary for biological birth. Its conceptual origin is traced to the natural wait, motherly warmth and physical \"brooding\" provided by birds such as a hen upon her eggs - a process that is essential to hatching and birth; the Vedic scholars used mother nature's example to explain and extend this concept to hatching of knowledge and spiritual rebirth.\n\nSome of the earliest reference of \"tapas\", and compound words from the root \"tap\" (तप) is found in many ancient Hindu scriptures, including the Ŗg Veda (10.154.5), Satapatha Brahmana (5.3 - 5.17), and Atharva Veda (4.34.1, 6.61.1, 11.1.26). In these texts, \"tapas\" is described as the process that led to the spiritual birth of ṛṣis - sages of spiritual insights. The Atharva Veda suggests all the gods were \"tapas\"-born (\"tapojās\"), and all earthly life was created from the sun's \"tapas\" (\"tapasah sambabhũvur\"). In the Jāiminiya-Upanisad Brāhmaņa, life perpetuates itself and creates progeny by \"tapas\", a process that starts with sexual heat.\n\nSanskrit \"tapasyā\" (neuter gender), literally \"produced by heat\", refers to a personal endeavor of discipline, undertaken to achieve a goal. One who undertakes tapas is a \"Tapasvin\". The fire deity of Hinduism, \"Agni\", is central to many Hindu rituals such as \"yajna\" and \"homa\". Agni is considered an agent of heat, of sexual energy, of incubation; Agni is considered a great \"tapasvin\".\n\nThe word \"tapasvi\" refers to a male ascetic or meditator, while \"tapasvinī\" to a female.\n\nBefore he reached his enlightenment, the Buddha tried asceticism (self-mortification) of the type found in other Śramaṇa religions (Jainism), and this is referred to as \"Tapas\" (Tibetan: \"dka' thub\", Chinese: \"kuxing\", Japanese: \"kugyo\", Korean: \"kohaeng\"). Post-enlightenment, the Buddhist doctrines of the Middle Way and Noble Eightfold Path did not include ascetic practices. \n\nThe Buddha, in multiple Buddhist texts, such as \"Majjhima Nikaya\" and \"Devadaha Sutta\", attributes the ascetic self-mortification style \"Tapas\" practices to Jainism (\"Niganthas\"), wherein such practices annihilate past Karmas and stop new Karmas from being created, ones that lead to the cycle of rebirths in Saṃsāra. These ancient Buddhist texts are significant in their claims of the existence of Jain Brahmins and ascetics, along with their karma doctrine and reasons for their \"Tapas\" practices in ancient times:\n\nThese ascetic \"Tapas\" practices is also confirmed by Jainism texts such as \"Uttarajjhyayana\". The Buddhist scholar Dharmakirti strongly criticizes the Jaina practice of \"Tapas\" as a means of liberation, while many Jainism scholars have in turn strongly criticized Dharmakirti opinion and analysis, explaining why their approach to ascetic \"Tapas\" is appropriate.\n\nAccording to Hajime Nakamura and other scholars, some scriptures of early Buddhism suggest that ascetic \"Tapas\" was a part of Buddhist practice in its early days, wherein body-mortification was an option for the Buddhist monk in his spiritual practice.\n\nIn the Theravada tradition of Thailand, a monastic practice emerged in the 12th-century who did \"Tapas\" as ascetic wandering and forest or crematory dwelling monks, with austere practices, and these came to be known as \"Thudong\". These ascetic Buddhist monks are also found in Myanmar, and as in Thailand, they are known to pursue their own version of Buddhism, resisting the hierarchical institutionalized \"sangha\" structure of monasteries in Buddhism. Textual evidence suggests that ascetic\"Tapas\" practices were a part of the Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka by the 3rd century BCE, and this tradition continued through the medieval era in parallel to \"sangha\" style monastic tradition.\n\nIn the Mahayana tradition, asceticism with esoteric and mystical meanings became an accepted practice, such as in the Tendai and Shingon schools of Japanese Buddhism. These Japanese practices included penance, austerities, ablutions under a waterfall, and rituals to purify oneself. Japanese records from the 12th century record stories of monks undertaking severe asceticism, while records suggest that 19th century Nichiren Buddhist monks woke up at midnight or 2:00 AM daily, and performed ascetic water purification rituals as a part of \"Tapas\". Other practices include the extreme ascetic practices of eating only pine needles, resins, seeds and ultimately self-mummification, while alive, or \"Sokushinbutsu\" (\"miira\") in Japan.\n\nElsewhere, in mainstream Buddhism, over time the meaning of the word \"Tapas\" evolved, wherein ascetic penance was forsaken, and \"Tapas\" meant meditative and spiritual practices.\n\nThe word \"Tapas\" appears extensively in Buddhist literature where, states Richard Gombrich, it does not mean \"asceticism or mortification\". The term \"Tapas\" means \"meditation\" or \"reasoned moral self discipline\" or both in Buddhism. According to Bailey and Mabbett, these Buddhist ideas are similar to those found in the Brahmanical (Vedic) tradition, wherein there is a great deal of overlap in the concepts of \"Tapas\", Yoga, meditation and gnosis (knowledge), yet the term \"Tapas\" is rooted in the inner \"mystic heat\" themes of the Indian religions.\n\nThe earliest mention of \"Tapas\" is in the Vedic texts. The concept of \"Tapas\" as symbolism for spiritual rebirth begins in the Vedas. Atharva Veda verse 11.5.3 compares the process of spiritual rebirth of a student in care of his or her teacher, with the gestation process during the biological birth of a baby in a mother's womb.\n\n\"Tapas\" is also found in the Upanishads. The \"Chāndogya Upaniṣad\", for example, suggests that those who engage in ritualistic offerings to gods and priests will fail in their spiritual practice while those who engage in tapas and self-examination will succeed. The \"Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad\" states that realization of self requires a search for truth and \"Tapas\" (meditation).\n\nMeditation and achievement of lucid knowledge is declared essential to self-realization in ancient scriptures. Texts by Adi Sankara suggests \"Tapas\" is important, but not sufficient for spiritual practice. Later Hindu scholars introduce a discussion of ‘false ascetic’, as one who go through the mechanics of tapas, without meditating on the nature of Brahman. Tapas is an element of spiritual path, state Indian texts. The concept is extensively mentioned in the Vedas, and the Upanishads.\nAccording to Walter Kaelber, and others, in certain translations of ancient Sanskrit documents \"Tapas\" is interpreted as austerities and asceticism; however, this is frequently inadequate because it fails to reflect the context implied, which is of sexual heat or warmth that incubates the birth of life. The idea of linking austerity, exertion, fatigue and self-renunciation to the ancient idea of heat, brooding and inner devotion, comes from the observed labor every mother puts in caring for its embryo and delivering her baby, regardless of the life form; The concept and reference to 'egg hatching' is replaced in Sanskrit texts written in later centuries, with simply 'brooding' or 'incubation'.\n\nIn ancient literature of Hinduism dedicated to love, desire, lust, seduction and sex, the root of the word \"Tapas\" is commonly used. For example, in Atharva Veda, a mantra recommended for a woman who wishes to win or compel a man's love is, 'Love's consuming longing, this passion this yearning, which the gods have poured, into the waters of life, I kindle for thee (\"tam te tapāmi\"), by the law of Varuna.' Desire (\"kāma\") is homologized with the concept of \"Tapas\", to explain the feelings and inner energy that leads to sexual intercourse. Agnicayana, Satapatha Brahmana and other ancient texts similarly use the root of the word \"Tapas\" to symbolize emotions, biological stages and a mother's effort from conception to the birth of a baby.\n\nBoth meanings of \"Tapas\" are found in various Hindu texts. In some ancient texts, \"Tapas\" has the sense of ascetic mortification in a sense similar to other Indian religions, while in the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga school of Hinduism, the term means self-training and virtuous living in a sense similar to Buddhism. In the Puranas and the texts of the goddess tradition of Hinduism, the term is equivalent to a devotion with intense self-discipline, believed to yield special inner powers. In contemporary usage, any practice that includes hardship and requires perseverance – such as fasting during Vrata – is called \"Tapas\".\n\nPatañjali, in his Yoga Sūtra, lists \"Tāpas\" as one of the Niyamas (virtuous practices), and describes it in several sections such as 2.32, 2.43 and 4.1. The term includes self-discipline, meditation, simple and austere living or any means of inner self-purification. \"Tapas\" in the Patanjali text and other Hindu texts on Yoga, states Benjamin Smith, is that which is \"a means for perfection of the body and the organs through the lessening of impurities\" and a foundation for a yogi's pursuit of perfection.\n\n\"Tapas\" in the Hindu traditions is part of a stage of life, called brahmacharya. The Vedic literature suggests \"diksa\" (incubation of a student in a field of knowledge) requires \"tapas\", and \"tapas\" is enabled by the state of brahmacharya. This state sometimes includes \"tapas\" such as \"vrata\" (fasting, sacrifice of food), \"sram\" (philanthropic social work, sacrifice of income), silence (sacrifice of speech), and asceticism (bare minimum living, sacrifice of comfort). Oldenberg notes that Brahmana scripture suggests that the Brahmachari should carry tapas to the very tip of his existence, which includes not cutting his hair, nail and beard. Thus, during this process of spiritual rebirth and \"diksa\", the \"tapas\" observed by a Brahmachari may include silence, fasting, seclusion, chastity, as well other activities. The goal of \"tapas\" is to help focus the Brahmachari on meditation, observation of reality, reflection and spiritual rebirth. Brahmacharya and \"tapasya\" are interrelated, with the student life expected to simple and austere, dedicated to the learning.\n\n\"Tapas\" is a central concept in Jainism. It refers to the spiritual practice of body mortification, penance and austerities, in order to burn away past karma and stop producing new karma, thereby reaching \"siddha\" (liberating oneself). Ascetic \"Tapas\" among Jaina monks, both internal and external, is believed to be essential for spiritual growth and \"kevalya\" (moksha, liberation). The details of the \"Tapas\" practices vary between the different traditions within Jainism.\n\nThe Jain text \"Sarvarthasiddhi\", a commentary by Pujyapada, claims that the Hindu Samkhya school emphasizes \"knowledge only, no practices\", while the Vaisheshikas emphasize \"practices only, no knowledge\" as part of \"Tapas\" and the means of reaching moksha. Another Jain text \"Tattvartha Sutra\", by Umaswati, in chapter 9, asserts that \"Tapas\" includes several kinds of meditation.\n\nThe \"Tapas\" in Jainism include internal practices and external austerities. External \"Tapas\" include fasting, tolerating hardships inflicted by other people or animals, tolerating all discomfort from weather by nakedness or near nakedness and the lack of any possessions, lack of shelter, walking and wandering alone without fearing anything and without hurting anyone. The internal \"Tapas\" include words and inner thoughts (intent) that resonate with the external \"Tapas\" (action). The list of internal and external austerities in Jainism vary with the text and tradition, with \"Tattvartha Sutra\", \"Uttaradhyayana Sutra\" and \"Bhagavati Sutra\" stating:\n\n\nIn Jainism, \"Tapas\" implies a control on desires, and is a form a self purification. Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara undertook ascetic \"Tapas\" for twelve years, after which he attained Kevala Jnana (liberating supreme knowledge).\n\nAjivikas was another ancient Indian religion which survived through about 13th-century CE, but became extinct thereafter, in which \"Tapas\" was a central concept as a means of salvation. According to Arthur Basham, the Ajivikas believed in the most rigorous ascetic practices in public. They believed in not harming anything and not being a cause of hurt to any living creature or substance, so they ate refuse, waste products, went deep into forests, mountains or isolated caves to live their austere life.\n\nOne of the Buddhist canonical texts, \"Nanguttha Jataka\", claims that the Ajivikas perform severe ascetic practices as part of their \"Tapas\", including sleeping on a bed of thorns and other forms of self-mortification. The Jainism text \"Sthananga Sutra\" claims that the Ajivikas performed severe penances and self-mortification as part of their \"Tapas\" practice. A mention of the ascetic practices of Ajivikas is found in Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature, where they are spelled as \"Ashibikas\".\n\nAjivikas were a Śramaṇa religion, just like Buddhism and Jainism, and these competed with each other. Most of the Ajivika texts have not survived. The \"Tapas\" practices of Ajivikas, as well as other information about them is primarily from the Buddhist and Jain texts; scholars question whether the description of Ajivikas has been fairly and completely summarized in these, or are these polemic misrepresentations.\n\nModern mendicants pursue \"Tapas\" - meditation and study of religion in ashrams across India.\n\n\n\n"}

He was formally known as \"Sirichongba\" and even more popularly known as \"Sirijonga II.\"\n\nSirijunga was born in Tellok kuchintar (Yangwarok area) in Limbuwan in 1704. Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe real name as Rupi haang. The (Haang or Subba) part of the name is a common Limbu term indicating a family of high or royal origin. Sirijunga had accepted his Lepcha nickname by claiming to be the incarnation of a legendary 9th-century historical figure called \"Sirijonga haang\". It has been widely believed that it was this legendary historical figure who preserved and revived the ancient Limbu script, but many now feel that the Sirijonga haang legend was most likely created by the 18th-century Sirijunga himself, with the intention of making the Limbu and Lepcha people more ready to believe and follow his teachings.\n\nSirijunga Xin Thebe researched and taught the Limbu script language and religion of the Limbu's in various part of Limbuwan and Sikkim, India. Sirijunga revived the old Limbu script. With the use of his newly revived script, he collected, composed and copied huge amounts of Limbu literature pertaining to history and cultural traditions. He travelled extensively through remote regions, attempting to amass sources of Limbu knowledge and culture. Eventually, he began going from village to village, publicising his findings and establishing centres of Limbu learning. In doing all of this, Sirijunga laid the foundation for a Limbu ethnic revival, and contributed significantly to the resistance against Tibetan Buddhist cultural domination. Sirijunga preached that acquiring broad cultural knowledge and experience was the key to the revival and enrichment of a community. In an attempt to trace the sources of his culture, he at first studied with local Tibetan Buddhist lamas, who at the time were the only means of connecting to a learned tradition in the region.\n\nSirijunga was also witness to the influx of the Hindu-based Khas culture from the western hill districts of today's Nepal. As such, along with his preliminary studies under the local lamas, he also practiced reading and writing in contemporary Khas, now known as Nepali. In order to better understand the dynamics at play in the region and to gather support for his movement, Sirijunga traveled far and wide to establish contact with rulers and powerful personalities. In one of these travels, it seems that he had either contacted or met King Jayaprakash Malla of Kathmandu. This multi-lingual and multi-cultural exposure to Buddhist and Hindu standards enabled Sirijunga to grasp the fundamentals of both the region's dominant cultures. During Sirijunga's life, the Bhutanese and Sikkimese quest for greater control over the eastern Himalaya led to many wars between Limbu and Sikkimese Bhutia (Bhutia indicating Tibetan origin) authorities. In due time, the lamas of Sikkim were able to extend their monastic centres in the northern areas of the part of Limbuwan that now lies in Nepal. After some time, this cultural encroachment enabled the Bhutia rulers to repeatedly subdue and take control of the entire Limbuwan territory.\n\nThe root of this state of conflict can be seen to lie in the politics of culture and knowledge at play in the region. Sikkimese Tibetan rulers and Buddhist spiritual leaders were able to subjugate the entire far-eastern Kirat region by means of their hold over the established learned traditions and the systematic spiritual culture of Buddhism. It was the realisation of this that led Sirijunga to emphasise the necessity of a peaceful, knowledge-based movement.\n\nSirijunga's contribution in spreading Limbu script, Limbu language, Mundhum and literature is immense. The Postal Services Department, Nepal Philatelic Bureau, Kathmandu has issued a postal ticket in his name in the Personalities Series.\n\nIn present-day terms, Sirijanga's ethnic movement can be said to be one of Limbu empowerment through education. Sirijanga's movement came to represent a significant threat, in particular to the Sikkimese Bhutia rulers and their spiritual gurus. His writings and teachings through the Limbu alphabet and literary texts he collected attracted significant numbers of Limbu's and Lepchas, and led to the start of an ethnic awakening. Sirijunga was able to establish centres of Limbu cultural and religious learning in many places throughout the eastern Himalayan hills. The Sikkimese authorities felt threatened. Sirijunga was killed in Martam, Hee-Bermiok in West Sikkim in 1741 after being tied to a tree and shot at with arrows. The Limbu learning centres that he established were thus destroyed and Sirijunga's disciples murdered or brutally suppressed by the Bhutias for defying their insistence to convert the Limbu's to Buddhism and also for the growth of the Limbu language and script that Sirijunga had taught. The place where Sirijunga was killed has a become a shrine to all people (irrespective of class, creed, and religion) from Sikkim and Nepal.\n"}
{"id": "56479", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=56479", "title": "Theaetetus (dialogue)", "text": "Theaetetus (dialogue)\n\nThe Theaetetus (; ) is one of Plato's dialogues concerning the nature of knowledge, written \"circa\" 369 BC.\n\nIn this dialogue, Socrates and Theaetetus discuss three definitions of knowledge: knowledge as nothing but \"perception\", knowledge as \"true judgment\", and, finally, knowledge as a \"true judgment with an account.\" Each of these definitions is shown to be unsatisfactory.\n\nSocrates declares Theaetetus will have benefited from discovering what he does not know, and that he may be better able to approach the topic in the future. The conversation ends with Socrates' announcement that he has to go to court to face a criminal indictment.\n\nThe dialogue is framed by a brief scene in which Euclid of Megara tells his friend Terpsion that he has a written record of a dialogue between Socrates and Theaetetus, which occurred when Theaetetus was quite a young man. This dialogue is then read aloud to the two men by a slave boy owned by Euclid.\n\nSocrates asks Theodorus if he knows of any geometry students who show particular promise. Theodorus assures him that he does, but that he does not want to over-praise the boy, lest anyone suspect he is in love with him. He says that the boy, Theaetetus, is a young Socrates look-alike, rather homely, with a snub-nose and protruding eyes. The two older men spot Theaetetus rubbing himself down with oil, and Theodorus reviews the facts about him, that he is intelligent, virile, and an orphan whose inheritance has been squandered by trustees.\n\nSocrates tells Theaetetus that he cannot make out what knowledge is, and is looking for a simple formula for it. Theaetetus says he really has no idea how to answer the question, and Socrates tells him that he is there to help. Socrates says he has modelled his career after his midwife mother. She delivered babies and for his part, Socrates can tell when a young man is in the throes of trying to give birth to a thought. Socrates considers his philosophical work as midwifery (Maieutics). This method, later also called Socratic method, consists in eliciting knowledge by a series of questions and answers.\n\nSocrates thinks that the idea that knowledge is perception must be identical in meaning, if not in actual words, to Protagoras' famous maxim \"Man is the measure of all things.\" Socrates wrestles to conflate the two ideas, and stirs in for good measure a claim about Homer being the captain of a team of Heraclitan flux theorists. Socrates dictates a complete textbook of logical fallacies to the bewildered Theaetetus. When Socrates tells the child that he (Socrates) will later be smaller \"without losing an inch\" because Theaetetus will have grown relative to him, the child complains of dizziness (155c). In an often quoted line, Socrates says with delight that \"wonder (thaumazein) belongs to the philosopher\". He admonishes the boy to be patient and bear with his questions, so that his hidden beliefs may be yanked out into the bright light of day.\n\nWhen Socrates sums up what they have agreed on so far, it becomes problematic that knowledge is sense perception, for Socrates raises the question that \"When the same wind blows, one of us feels cold and the other not?\" As a result, he introduces the idea of Heraclitean flux to act as a defense to the wind objection. Heracliteanism shows that \"Nothing is in itself just one thing...Everything is in a process of coming to be\". Thus as there is no fixed meaning in things, but they draw their meaning in a referential difference to other things, the wind objection can be incorporated into Theaetetus's claim that \"Knowledge is sense perception\". As a result, they can then continue their inquiry as to the truth of this claim. It is important to note that the Heraclitean doctrine of Flux is not the same as the Protagorean doctrine. The Protagorean is radical truth relativism whereas the Heraclitean is radical reality relativism. It serves as a supporting theory to the Protagorean interpretation of Theaetetus's claim, in order that they might fully inquire as to the validity of this premise. Socrates admits that it is unfortunate that Protagoras is dead and cannot defend his idea against people such as himself. He says that the two of them are \"trampling on his orphan\" (164e) but the charge remains.\n\nSince Protagoras is dead, Socrates puts himself in the sophist's shoes and tries to do him the favor of defending his idea (166a-168c). Socrates concedes that if Protagoras were still alive, he would have more to say in his own defense, and that they are now essentially mistreating \"his orphan child.\" Putting words in the dead sophist's mouth, Socrates declares that Protagoras asserts with his maxim that all things are in motion and whatever seems to be the case, is the case for the perceiver, whether the individual or the state.\n\nAt the end of his speech, Socrates admits to Theodorus that Protagoras would have done a far better job of defending his own ideas. Theodorus tells Socrates that he must be kidding, that he has come to the task with boyish vigor. Theodorus does not claim to be a disciple of Protagoras, but states that he was a friend. Socrates invites Theodorus to put up a more vigorous defense of Protagoras, as he does not want it suggested that he has used the child's timidity (of Theaetetus) to aid him in his argument against the doctrine of Protagoras (168d).\n\nSocrates, not at all certain that he has not misrepresented Protagoras in making each man the measure of his own wisdom, presses Theodorus on the question of whether any follower of Protagoras (himself included) would contend that nobody thinks anyone else is wrong (170c). Theodorus proves to be helpless against Socrates' arguments. He agrees that Protagoras concedes that those who disagree with him are correct (171a). In making Protagoras a complete epistemological relativist, where every person's individual perceptions are his reality and his truth, both Socrates and Theodorus paint Protagoras as maintaining an absurd position.\n\nSocrates then proceeds to explain why philosophers seem clumsy and stupid to the common lot of humanity. Socrates explains that philosophers are open to mockery because they are not concerned about what interests most people: they could not care less about the scandals in their neighbor's house, the tracing of one's ancestry to Heracles, and so on. In contrast, the philosopher is concerned with things that \"are\", such as beauty and knowledge, which are \"truly higher up\". It is here that Socrates draws the classic portrait of the absent-minded intellectual who cannot make his bed or cook a meal (175e). Socrates adds a big bifurcation to this speech, saying that there are only two kinds of lives to be lived: a divinely happy one, lived by righteous philosophers or a godless, miserable one, such as most people live (176-177). Socrates admits this was a digression that threatens to drown his original project, which was to define knowledge. Theodorus, the old geometer, tells Socrates that he finds this sort of thing easier to follow than his earlier arguments.\n\nSocrates says that the men of flux, like Homer and Heraclitus, are really hard to talk to because you can't pin them down. When you ask them a question, he says, they pluck from their quiver a little aphorism to let fly at you, and as you try to figure that one out, they wing another one at you. They leave nothing settled either in discourse, or in their own minds. Socrates adds that the opposite school of thought, that teaches of the \"immovable whole\" is just as hard to talk to (181a,b). Socrates says he met the father of the idea, Parmenides, when he was quite young, but does not want to get into another digression over it.\n\nSocrates compares the human mind to an aviary. Socrates draws the distinction between \"having\" and \"possessing\"; the former typically implies the latter, though on the other hand, one can possess something, such as a bird, without actually having it (with them at any moment)(199a). Socrates says that as a man goes hunting about in his mind for knowledge of something, he might grab hold of the wrong thing. He says that mistaking \"eleven\" for \"twelve\" is like going in for a pigeon and coming up with a dove (199b). Theaetetus joins in the game, and says that to complete the picture, you need to envision pieces of ignorance flying around in there with the birds. But if this is the case, how would you be able to distinguish between the birds representing real knowledge and the ones representing false ones? Are there other birds that represent this type of knowledge? Socrates comes to the conclusion that this is absurd and therefore he discards the aviary analogy.\n\nAfter discarding the bird-cage analogy, Socrates and Theaetetus return to the definition of knowledge as 'true judgement' (200e). This, Theaetetus argues, is true because it is 'free from mistakes' (200e). However Socrates introduces an example of a jury in the law-courts, being persuaded of an opinion by a lawyer. This persuasion is not the same as knowing the truth, as all is produced is 'conviction' in judging whatever the lawyers want (201a). Although Theaetetus hopes it is possible the lawyer will be able to 'persuade' the jury of the truth (201b), Socrates is unsatisfied as if they are justly persuaded, they will have true knowledge. However, in Socrates' belief, they cannot make a correct judgement as they would not have true knowledge (201c). With this conflict, Socrates decides that true judgement and knowledge must be different things.\n\nAfter distinguishing between knowledge and true judgement, Theaetetus recalls being told that true judgement 'with an account (\"logos\") equates to knowledge (201d). Things without an account are 'unknowable', while things with an account are 'knowable'.\n\nSocrates responds by telling of a dream, in which he overheard people talking of primary elements (201e). These primary elements can only be named, they cannot be thought of as existing or not - he gives examples of words like 'itself, or that, each, alone or this' (202a). While they can be added to other words, they by themselves are just a name. When these elements are added together, Socrates says that a 'complex' is formed (202b). The primary elements are 'unaccountable and unknowable, but perceivable' while the complexes are 'knowable and expressible' and so can be objects of 'true judgement' (202b). He concludes his dream by agreeing with Theaetetus that knowledge is 'true judgement with an account' (202c).\n\nHowever, Socrates exposes some difficulties by examining letters. He takes the first two letters of his name, S and O to wonder if the syllable 'So' is knowable while the individual letters are not (203b-d). Theaetetus finds the idea strange, so Socrates deduces that in order to know the syllable, the letters must be known first (203e). Socrates proposes that the syllable can be a 'single form' produced from the letters. With this in mind, Socrates considers whether the 'sum' and the 'whole' are the same (204a). Theaetetus initially says they are not, but changes his mind in confusion when Socrates leads him through maths and the different ways of expressing the number six (204c-205b). After agreeing this, Socrates returns to the subject of syllables and letters to conclude from Theaetetus' answers that syllables are different from letters and cannot contain letters (205b). Theaetetus admits this idea is ridiculous (205c). Socrates returns to talking about elements and complexes to propose that they are in the same class, as they have 'no parts and [are] a single form' (205d).\n\nSocrates sums up this reversal by remarking that if anyone tries to tell them the complex is knowable and expressable while the element is the opposite, 'we had better not listen to him' (205e). He cites the example of a musician distinguishing individual notes (conceded to be elements of music) to propose that elements are 'much more clearly known'(206b).\n\nSocrates proposes an account to be 'making one's thought apparent vocally by means of words and verbal expressions' (206d). However, he wonders if that is so, everyone will be able to make judgement 'with an account' as they can all (except for the deaf and dumb) vocalize and express opinions on matters (206e). Socrates examines it further by suggesting that a man who can vocalize his judgement must be able to make reference to the primary elements of the subject (207a). Giving an example of defining a wagon by its individual parts (207a), agreement is reached that an account is 'going through a thing element by element'(207d). Socrates questions Theaetetus by drawing on his learning of how to write, and the idea that if you misplace individual elements (letters) of a name, that does not mean you have knowledge of it (208a). This finishes Socrates' second definition of an account as 'the way to the whole through the elements' (208c). The third definition Socrates offers is 'being able to tell some mark by which the object you are asked about differs from all other things' (208c), giving the example that the Sun is distinct for its brightness. However, this definition of an account fails as by getting to know the differentness of an object, you have to acquire knowledge about it. Thus the answer to the initial question 'What is knowledge' would be heavily circuitous - correct judgement accompanied by 'knowledge' of the differentness, which Socrates admits is 'silly' (210a).\n\nSocrates concludes the dialogue by announcing that all the two have produced are mere \"wind-eggs\" and that he must be getting on now to the courthouse to face his trial being brought against him by Meletus.\n\nIn this dialogue, Socrates refers to Epicharmus of Kos as \"the prince of Comedy\" and Homer as \"the prince of Tragedy\", and both as \"great masters of either kind of poetry\". This is significant because it is one of the very few extant references in greater antiquity (Fourth century BCE) to Epicharmus and his work. Another reference is in Plato's \"Gorgias\" dialogue.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "304972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=304972", "title": "Vasubandhu", "text": "Vasubandhu\n\nVasubandhu (Sanskrit; ; ) (fl. 4th to 5th century CE) was an influential Buddhist monk and scholar from Gandhara. Vasubandhu was a philosopher who wrote on the Abhidharma from the perspectives of the Sarvastivada and Sautrāntika schools. Along with his half-brother Asanga, he was also one of the main founders of the Yogacara school after his conversion to Mahayana Buddhism.\n\nVasubandhu's \"Abhidharmakośakārikā\" (\"Commentary on the Treasury of the Abhidharma\") is widely used in Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism as the major source for non-Mahayana Abhidharma philosophy. His philosophical verse works set forth the standard for the Indian Yogacara metaphysics of \"appearance only\" (\"vijñapti-mātra\"), which has been described as a form of \"epistemological idealism\", phenomenology and close to Immanuel Kant's transcendental idealism. Apart from this, he wrote several commentaries, works on logic, argumentation and devotional poetry.\n\nVasubandhu is one of the most influential thinkers in the Indian Buddhist philosophical tradition. In Jōdo Shinshū, he is considered the Second Patriarch and in Chan Buddhism, he is the 21st Patriarch.\n\nBorn in Peshawar (present-day Pakistan), Vasubandhu was the half brother of Asanga, another key personage in the founding of the Yogacara philosophy. Vasubandhu's name means \"the Kinsman of Abundance.\" He and Asanga are members of the \"Six Ornaments\" or six great commentators on the Buddha’s teachings. He was contemporaneous with Chandragupta I, father of Samudragupta. This information temporally places this Vasubandhu in the 4th century CE. The earliest biography of Vasubandhu was translated into Chinese by Paramärtha (499-569).\nVasubandhu initially studied with the Buddhist Sarvastivada (also called Vaibhāṣika, who upheld the Mahavibhasa) school which was dominant in Gandhara, and then later moved to Kashmir to study with the heads of the orthodox Sarvastivada branch there. After returning home he lectured on Abhidharma and composed the Abhidharmakośakārikā (Verses on the Treasury of the Abhidharma), a verse distillation of Sarvastivada Abhidharma teachings, which was an analysis of all factors of experience into its constituent dharmas (phenomenal events). However Vasubandhu had also begun to question Sarvastivada orthodoxy for some time, and had studied with the Sautantrika teacher Manoratha. Due to this, he then went on to publish an auto-commentary to his own verses, criticizing the Sarvastivada system from a Sautrāntika viewpoint (also called Dārṣtāntika).\n\nHe is later said to have converted to Mahayana beliefs under the influence of his brother Asanga, whereupon he composed a number of voluminous treatises, especially on Yogacara doctrines and Mahayana sutras. Most influential in the East Asian Buddhist tradition have been the \"Vimśatikāvijñaptimātratāsiddhi\", the \"Twenty Verses on Consciousness Only\", with its commentary (Viṃśatikāvṛtti), the \"Triṃśikā-vijñaptimātratā\", the \"Thirty Verses on Consciousness-only\" and the \"Three Natures Exposition\" (Trisvabhāvanirdeśa). Vasubandhu also wrote a texts on Buddhist Hermeneutics, the \"Proper Mode of Exposition\" (Vyākhyāyukti). Vasubandhu thus became a major Mahayana master, scholar and debater, famously defeating the Samkhya philosophers in debate in front of the Gupta king Vikramaditya (variously identified as Chandragupta II or Skandagupta) at Ayodhya, who is said to have rewarded him with 300,000 pieces of gold. Vasubandhu used the money he made from royal patronage and debating victories to build Buddhist monasteries and hospitals.\n\nHe was prolific, writing a large number of other works, including:\n\n\nErich Frauwallner, a mid-20th-century Buddhologist, sought to distinguish two Vasubandhus, one the Yogācārin and the other a Sautrāntika, but this view has largely fallen from favour in part on the basis of the anonymous \"Abhidharma-dīpa\", a critique of the \"Abhidharmakośakārikā\" which clearly identifies Vasubandhu as the sole author of both groups of writings. According to Dan Lusthaus, \"Since the progression and development of his thought ... is so strikingly evident in these works, and the similarity of vocabulary and style of argument so apparent across the texts, the theory of Two Vasubandhus has little merit.\" Scholarly consensus on this question has generally moved away from Frauwallner's \"two-authors\" position.\n\nVasubandhu's \"Verses on the Treasury of the Abhidharma\" contains a description of all 75 dharmas (phenomenal events), and then outlines the entire Sarvastivada doctrine including \"meditation practices, cosmology, theories of perception, causal theories, the causes and elimination of moral problems, the theory of rebirth, and the qualities of a Buddha.\" The Treasury and its commentary also expound all kinds of arguments relating to the Sarvastivada Abhidharma and critique those arguments from a Sautantrika perspective in the commentary. Major arguments include an extensive critique of the Self (Atman and Pudgala) and a critique of the Sarvastivada theory of \"the existence of the dharmas of the three time periods [past, present and future]\". In the Treasury, Vasubadhu also argued against a Creator God (Ishvara) and against the Sarvastivada theory of \"avijñaptirūpa\" (\"unperceived physicality\" or \"invisible physicality\").\n\nVasubandhu's critique of the Self is a defence of Buddhist Anatman doctrine, and also a critique of the Buddhist Personalist School and Hindu view of the soul. It is intended to show the unreality of the self or person as over and above the five skandhas (heaps, aggregates which make up an individual). Vasubandhu begins by outlining the soteriological motive for his argument, writing that any view which sees the self as having independent reality (e.g. the Hindu view) is not conductive to Nirvana.\n\nVasubandhu then evaluates the idea of the Self from epistemic grounds (Pramana). Vasubandhu states that what is real can only be known from perception (Pratyakṣa) or inference (Anumāṇa). Perception allows one to observe directly the objects of the six sense spheres. Inference allows one to infer the existence of sense organs. However, there is no such inference for a solid real Self apart from the stream of constantly changing sense perceptions and mental activity of the sense spheres.\n\nVasubandhu also argues that because the Self is not causally efficient, it is mere convention (prajñapti) and a “conceptual construction” (parikalpita). This argument is mainly against the Buddhist Pudgalavada school who held a view of a 'person' that was dependent on the five aggregates, yet was also distinct, in order to account for the continuity of personality. Vasubandhu sees this as illogical, for him, the Self is made up of constantly changing sensory organs, sense impressions, ideas and mental processes and any imagined unity of self-hood is a false projection.\n\nVasubandhu also uses this analysis of the stream of consciousness to attack non-Buddhist Hindu views of the Atman. Vasubandhu shows that the Hindu view of the Self as 'controller' is refuted by an analysis of the flux and disorder of mental events and the inability of the supposed Self to control our minds and thoughts in any way we would like. If the Self is truly an eternal un-caused agent, it should be unaffected by mere physical and mental causes, and it also seems difficult to explain how such a force existing independently outside of the mind could causally interact with it. Vasubandhu also answers several common objections to the Buddhist not-self view such as how karma works without a Self and what exactly undergoes rebirth. Vasubandhu points to the causal continuum of aggregates/processes which undergoes various changes leading to future karmic events and rebirth.\n\nDuring Vasubandhu's era, the philosophy of space and time was an important issue in Buddhist philosophy. The Sarvāstivādin tradition which Vasubandhu studied held the view of the existence of dharmas (phenomenal events) in all three times (past, present, future). This was said to be their defining theoretical position, hence their name Sarvāstivāda is Sanskrit for \"theory of all exists\". In contrast to this eternalist view, the Sautrāntika, a rival offshoot, held the doctrine of \"extreme momentariness\", a form of presentism (only the present moment exists).\n\nIn the \"Abhidharmakośakārikā\", Vasubandhu puts forth the Sarvāstivādin theory, and then in his commentary (bhasya) he critiques this theory and argues for the 'momentariness' of the Sautrāntika. He also later wrote the \"Karma-siddhi-prakaraṇa\" (\"Exposition Establishing Karma\") which also expounded the momentariness view (\"kṣanikavāda\"). Vasubandhu's view here is that each dharma comes into existence only for a moment in which it discharges its causal efficacy and then self-destructs, the stream of experience is then a causal series of momentary dharmas. The issue of continuity and transference of karma is explained in the latter text by an exposition of the \"storehouse consciousness\" (\"ālayavijñāna\"), which stores karmic seeds (bīja) and survives rebirth.\n\nAccording to Dan Lusthaus, Vasubandhu's major ideas are:\n\n\nVasubandhu's main Yogacara works (Viṃśatikā and Triṃśikā) put forth the theory of \"vijñaptimātra\" which has been rendered variously as 'representation-only', 'consciousness-only' and 'appearance-only'. While some scholars such as Lusthaus see Vasubandhu as expounding a phenomenology of experience, others (Sean Butler) see him as expounding some form of Idealism similar to Kant or George Berkeley.\n\nThe Twenty verses begins by stating:\n\nIn Mahayana philosophy...[reality is] viewed as being consciousness-only...Mind (citta), thought (manas), consciousness (chit), and perception (pratyaksa) are synonyms. The word \"mind\" (citta) includes mental states and mental activities in its meaning. The word \"only\" is intended to deny the existence of any external objects of consciousness. We recognize, of course, that \"mental representations seem to be correlated with external (non-mental) objects; but this may be no different from situations in which people with vision disorders 'see' hairs, moons, and other things that are 'not there.'\"\n\nOne of Vasubandhu's main arguments in the Twenty verses is the Dream argument, which he uses to show that it is possible for mental representations to \"appear\" to be restricted by space and time. He uses the example of mass hallucinations (in Buddhist hell) to defend against those who would doubt that mental appearances can be shared. To counter the argument that mere mental events have no causal efficacy, he uses the example of a wet dream. Vasubandhu then turns to a mereological critique of physical theories, such as Buddhist atomism and Hindu Monism, showing that his appearance only view is much more parsimonious and rational.\n\nThe Thirty verses also outlines the Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses and how each one can be overcome on the stages of enlightenment, turning consciousness (vijnana) into unmediated cognition (jnana) by cleansing the stream of consciousness from ‘contaminations' and ‘defilements.’ The \"Treatise on Buddha Nature\" was extremely influential in East Asian Buddhism by propounding the concept of tathagatagarbha (Buddha Nature).\n\nThe Thirty verses and the \"Three Natures Exposition\" (Trisvabhavanirdesha) does not, like the Twenty verses, argue for appearance only, but assumes it and uses it to explain the nature of experience which is of \"three natures\" or \"three modes\". These are the fabricated nature (parikalpitasvabhāva), the dependent (paratantrasvabhāva) and the absolute (pariniṣpannasvabhāva). The fabricated nature is the world of everyday experience and mental appearances. Dependent nature is the causal process of the arising of the fabricated nature while the absolute nature is things as they are in themselves, with no subject object distinction.\n\nAccording to Vasubandhu, the absolute, reality itself (dharmatā) is non-dual, and the dichotomy of perception into perceiver and perceived is actually a conceptual fabrication. For Vasubandhu, to say that something is non-dual is that it is both conceptually non-dual and perceptually non-dual. To say that \"I\" exist is to conceptually divide the causal flux of the world into self and other, a false construct. Just the same, to say that an observed object is separate from the observer is also to impute a false conception into the world as it really is - perception only. Vasubandhu uses the analogy of a magician who uses a magic spell (dependent nature, conceptual construction) to make a piece of wood (the absolute, non-duality) look like an elephant (fabricated nature, duality). The basic problem for living beings who suffer is that they are fooled by the illusion into thinking that it is real, that self and duality exists, true wisdom is seeing through this illusion.\n\nVasubandhu contributed to Buddhist logic and is held to have been the origin of formal logic in the Indian logico-epistemological tradition. Vasubandhu was particularly interested in formal logic to fortify his contributions to the traditions of dialectical contestability and debate. Anacker (2005: p. 31) holds that: \n\n\"A Method for Argumentation (Vāda-vidhi)\" is the only work on logic by Vasabandhu which has to any extent survived. It is the earliest of the treatises known to have been written by him on the subject. This is all the more interesting because \"Vāda-vidhi\" marks the dawn of Indian formal logic. The title, \"Method for Argumentation\", indicates that Vasabandhu's concern with logic was primarily motivated by the wish to mould formally flawless arguments, and is thus a result of his interest in philosophical debate. \n\n\n\n"}

Her principal research interests are in observational cosmology, focusing on measuring both the current and past expansion rates of the universe, and on characterizing the nature of dark energy.\n\nFreedman grew up in a culturally Jewish family in Toronto, the daughter of a medical doctor and a concert pianist. Her early interest in science was kindled by a formative high-school physics class. This led her to the University of Toronto, where she was first a biophysics student, then an astronomy major, receiving her B.Sc. in 1979. She remained at Toronto for her graduate work, receiving a Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics in 1984. Joining the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California, as a post-doctoral fellow in 1984, she became a faculty member of the scientific staff three years later as the first woman to join Carnegie's permanent staff. In 2003 she was named to the Crawford H. Greenewalt Chair and Director of Carnegie Observatories. Freedman's early work was principally on the Cepheid distance scale.\n\nFreedman was co-leader of an international team of 30 astronomers to carry out the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project, a program aiming to establish the distance scale of the Universe and measure the current expansion rate, a quantity known as the Hubble constant. This quantity determines the size of the visible universe and is key to determining its age. Over the course of the Key Project, the team measured the distances to 24 galaxies using Cepheid variable stars, and measured the Hubble constant using five independent methods. The project's researchers, led by Freedman, published their final result in 2001. The work provided a value of the Hubble constant accurate to 10%, resolving a long-standing, factor-of-two debate.\n\nFreedman initiated the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) Project and served as chair of the board of directors from its inception in 2003 until 2015.

Evidence on his life is contained in the \"Book of Han\" and some later sources.\n\nZhang Cang was born in Yangwu 陽武 (present day Yuanyang, Henan Province).\n\nIn his youth, Zhang studied in Xun Kuang's circle, which was known for producing such prominent figures as Han Fei and Li Si. When the state of Qin conquered other vassal states of Zhou Dynasty, he came to Xianyang, the capital of Qin, and became an official to manage the imperial books. During the rule of Er Shi huang, Zhang Cang broke the imperial law and fled to his hometown. At that time, people and the nobles of former six vassal states rose up against the Qin's rule. Liu Bang, a general from Chu, was ordered by King Huai of Chu to lead his army westward. Zhang Cang enrolled Liu Bang's troops upon their passing of Yangwu.\n\nZhang Cang became a general in Liu Bang's army and arrived in Nanyang. When the Chu troops attacked Nanyang, Zhang's misbehavior became the reason for his condemnation to death. However, he was saved by Wang Ling (), an old friend of Liu Bang and the commander-in-chief, who later succeeded Cao Can on the post of prime minister of the Han Empire. Zhang Cang appreciated Wang Ling greatly from that day on, and regarded him as his father. Later on, after becoming the prime minister, Zhang would always visit Wang Ling's residence after court meeting to care Wang Ling's wife as his mother after Wang Ling died. According to the \"Book of Han\", Wang Ling saw the stripped Zhang Cang on the spot of execution and wondered at his impressively tall and beautiful body and persuaded Liu Bang to spare Zhang.\n\nIn BC 206, Liu Bang was named King of Han by Xiang Yu, another Chu general and claimant on the succession of the rule in China and Liu Bang's future arch-rival. Liu Bang went to Han his kingdom. Zhang Cang followed him and went to [Hanzhong]. Some months late, some former generals who had no gains from Xiang Yu's post-war arrangement rebelled (cf. Tian Rong and his activity in reestablishing the unified Kingdom of Qi, despite Xiang Yu's will). Xiang Yu drove Emperor Yi of Chu, the lord to all the kings in name, to Chen (modern Chenzhou, Hunan Province), and then ordered King of Jiujiang and King of Linjiang secretly to murder the Emperor Yi. \n\nLiu Bang was also unsatisfied with Xiang Yu. After Xiang Yu went eastward to Pengcheng (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province), he conquered three kingdoms which Xiang Yu founded. Then Han's troops matched eastward and the small kingdoms between Han and Chu surrendered to Han troops and joined the war against Xiang Yu's West Chu. Zhang Cang was one of the generals. Liu Bang ordered his generals to attack West Wei, Zhao and Dai. The three kingdoms were conquered, their kings surrendered or killed. Liu Bang nominated Zhang Er as the King of Zhao, and Zhang Cang as the Prime Minister to Zhang Er. Then Zhang Cang was changed as the governor of Dai, and then as the Prime Minister when Dai became a kingdom.\n\nZhang Cang finished his military career after Han Empire put down the rebellion of King Yan. For his merits, Zhang Cang was titled Marquis of Beiping. When Xiao He became the Empire's Prime Minister, Zhang Cang was appointed as the Minister of Audit, working as assistant to Prime Minister, because of his expertise in mathematics and music.\n\nIn 195 BCE, Ying Bu the King of Huainan Kingdom rose up against Han Empire and soon was defeated and killed, Liu Bang nominated his youngest son Liu Chang as the King of Huainan Kingdom. Zhang Cang was appointed as the Prime Minister of Huainan. In 181, Zhang Cang came back to Chang'an, the capital of Han Empire, and took the position of Yushi Daifu, the vice Prime Minister and the Supreme Justice of the Empire. The next year, as the member of the clique of meritorious generals and minister, Zhang Cang took part in the coup d'état against Empress Dowager Lü and extinguished the Lü's family as soon as she died. Then Zhang Cang also took part in electing Liu Heng the King of Dai Kingdom as the Emperor.\n\nIn BC176, Guan Ying died, and Zhang Cang succeeded to his position of Prime Minister of the Empire. He stayed in the position for more than ten years. At the end of rule of Emperor Xiaowen (Liu Heng), he participated in the cosmological argument concerning the position of the Han Dynasty in correlation with the \"wu xing\". Some scholars thought Han Dynasty corresponded to Earth, and must change the color of emperor and minister's uniforms into yellow. Meanwhile, the right correlate was Water, and so the empire must continue to use black as the noblest color as usual. The current correlate was established by Zhang Cang upon the foundation of the empire. However, a yellow dragon was found in Chengji (modern Gansu Province) was used as an argument against his theory. Correspondingly, the Emperor established a new era, to Zhang's discontent. As a result, Zhang Cang resigned his post saying that he was enough old and ill.\n\nZhang Cang died in 152 BCE, being more than 100 years of age. He was given the posthumous title \"Wen\" (文）, and entered history as Marquis Wen of Beiping.\n\nZhang Cang is described as a prominent master of the calendar and music theory of his time, and made great contribution on System Construction of Han Dynasty, according to Sima Qian's record. So Zhang Cang is regarded as the representative of Yin-Yang School. His writings were edited into the book bearing his name.\n\nIt is believed that \"The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art\", the most important book in early history of Chinese mathematics, was edited by him.\n\nZhang Cang was also a representative Confucian scholar of the transition period from the Warring States to Han. Kong Yingda (574 – 648) names him as recipient of Xunzi's transmission of the \"Zuo Zhuan\" (The Zuo Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Chronicle) His expertise in the \"Zuo Zhuan\" did not constitute the mainstream in the field, since the \"Zuo Commentary\" was related to the Old Text school, while in his time the New Text school was more popular (see New Text Confucianism).\n\nBeing a student of Xunzi, he transmitted his teaching to Jia Yi.\n"}
