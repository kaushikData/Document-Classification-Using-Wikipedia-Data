It draws from indigenous and world traditions using tenets of shamanistic, ecstatic, mystical and eastern philosophy. It also draws from Gestalt therapy, the human potential movement and transpersonal psychology.\nFundamental to the practice is the idea that everything is energy, and moves in waves, patterns and rhythms.\n\nRoth describes the practice as a soul journey, and says that by moving the body, releasing the heart, and freeing the mind, one can connect to the essence of the soul, the source of inspiration in which an individual has unlimited possibility and potential.\n\nThe practice of the 5Rhythms is said by Gabrielle Roth to put the body in motion in order to still the mind. The five rhythms (in order) are Flowing, Staccato, Chaos, Lyrical and Stillness. The 5Rhythms, when danced in sequence, are known as a \"Wave.\" A typical Wave takes about an hour to dance.\n\nLonger workshops may, according to \"The Dancing Path\", explore emotion, the cycle of life, the ego, relationships and spiritual vision.\n\nThe work is taught through a series of maps that explore the terrain of the inner and outer worlds of individuals, their relationships to others and the space around them. The maps offer a soul journey by exploring embodiment, emotions, the life cycle, the psyche, and the archetypes. The rhythms offer understanding of people's innate powers – being, loving, knowing, seeing and healing.\n\nThe first map, \"Waves\" teaches embodiment of the five distinct rhythms. To embody the rhythms means to access the deep internal wisdom that human bodies contain. The \"Heartbeat\" map teaches how people have embodied and how they express the emotions of fear, anger, sadness, joy and compassion; while the \"Cycles\" map provides insight and understanding about how one has internalized conditioning and relationships throughout the life cycle, specifically in the stages of birth, childhood, puberty, maturity and death. Insight and understanding of the ego is delivered through the psyche map, \"Mirrors\".\n\nRoth drew a circular \"Medicine Mandala\" that related each rhythm to an emotion, a stage of life, a way of perceiving, and an aspect of the self.\n\nRoth founded \"The Moving Center\" in New York in 1977 as a base for her workshops, and to train and develop teachers. \"5Rhythms Global\" was founded in 2013 as the international Institute training 5Rhythms teachers worldwide. The 5Rhythms Teachers Association was founded in 2007 as a professional association serving the continuing education of accredited 5Rhythms teachers. The 5Rhythms movement spread worldwide, and in 2017 there were 396 certified teachers and SpaceHolders in 50+ countries. 5Rhythms also forms part of the Open Floor movement practice designed by Andrea Juhan.\n\nCharlotte Macleod, writing in the \"London Evening Standard\" in 2009, describes dancing the 5Rhythms as a kind of antidote to life in a large city, and how she was attracted to a dance class by a video of Thom Yorke. The class leaves her \"mentally and physically refreshed, and oddly connected to the other dancers.\" The dance was \"a kind of moving meditation\" for her.\n\nChristine Ottery, writing in \"The Guardian\" in 2011, states that \"ecstatic dancing has an image problem\" and \"encompasses everything from large global movements such as 5Rhythms and Biodanza to local drum'n'dance meet-ups\". She suggests that readers may \"find 5 Rhythms a good place to start\", and does so herself: \"Nervously, I stretch and warm my muscles. As the rhythms take off, I shake off my shyness.\" She dances in different ways, alone or with partners. \"My body is expressing itself - it's utter abandonment and a complete high.\"\n\nJed Lipinski, writing in \"The New York Times\" in 2010, notes that 5Rhythms is suitable for all ages, unlike some other forms of dance and movement. He observes that \"At a recent 5Rhythms class ... in Manhattan, more than 100 people were gleefully writhing and leaping to tribal drumming courtesy of Ms. Roth's husband, Robert Ansell... Dancers occasionally released guttural howls, as if exorcising the demons of the workweek.\"\n\n\"The Daily Telegraph\" writes of 5Rhythms in 2007 that \"I love it precisely because it isn't based on learned steps. Instead, the idea is to find your own dance by moving your body in whatever way you fancy. For those of us keen to improve our fitness, it can also be an energetic aerobic workout.\"\n\nAcademics working in mental health and other fields are starting to carry out research about the 5Rhythms. The Mental Health Foundation, a UK charity published the 'Dancing for Living Report' describing a group of women's experience of 5Rhythms dance and the effects on their emotional wellbeing. The 5Rhythms have been the subject of a number of PhD theses.\n\nThe British TV sitcom \"Peep Show\" featured an episode (\"Dance Class\") where the two principal male characters attend a 'Rainbow Rhythms' class which invites its participants to interpretatively dance 'colours', featuring guidance and a closing circle reminiscent of a 5Rhythms class.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47706006", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47706006", "title": "Affective Meditation", "text": "Affective Meditation\n\nAffective Meditation is a Christian spiritual practice originating in Medieval Europe by which a pilgrim, worshipper, or other follower of Christ seeks to imagine the sights, sounds, tastes, smells, movement, and tactility of specific scenes from canonical Gospels and their characters, with particular emphasis on empathising with the compassion and suffering of Jesus and the joys and sorrows of the Virgin Mary, leading to the authentic and spontaneous expression of emotion.\n\nAffective Meditation is the spiritual practice around which the tradition and philosophy of affective piety revolves, and was initiated by Saint Anselm of Canterbury, subsequently by Bernard of Clairvaux, and latterly by Francis of Assisi, who are credited with spawning an expressive form of worship through which members of the clergy, monastic orders, and laity visualized and envisioned scenes from the life of Christ with which they empathized to such degree that their compassionate identification with the suffering of him and his mother Mary manifested in emotive vocal sounds and physical movements.\n\nThe following excerpt from a work by English writer, Abbot and saint Aelred of Rievaulx is indicative of instructions provided by Christians in the tradition of Affective Piety.\n...follow her [the Virgin Mary] as she goes to Bethlehem, and turning away from the inn with her, help and humor her during the birth; and when the little child is placed in the manger, burst out words of exultation, crying out with Isaiah: A child is born to us, a son is given to us...Embrace that sweet manger, let love conquer bashfulness, and emotion drive out fear so that you fix your lips on those most sacred feet and repeat the kisses.\nA further example comes from the writings of English hermit, mystic, and religious writer Richard Rolle, who expresses his empathy with the suffering of Christ in his work \"Meditation on the Passion\".\nAh, Lord, your sorrow--why was it not my death? Now they lead you forth as naked as a worm, with torturers around you and armed knights. The press of the crowd was incredibly intense as they threw things and harried you so shamefully, kicking at you as if you had been a dog. I see in my soul how ruefully you walk, your body so bloody, so raw and blistered. The crown on your head is so sharp, and your hair, blown in the wind, is all matted with blood. Your lovely face is so pale and swollen with the blows and the beatings, and covered with spittle and phlegm. And down runs your blood; it horrifies me to see it.\nThe experience of Affective Meditation is most often precipitated by meditating or concentrating attention on Christian drawings or paintings, music, or literature depicting the experience of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, until the meditator's empathy with the subjects of those depictions becomes sufficiently intense to precipitate emotive expression that may include tears and crying, vocal sounds and prayer, as well as bodily movements.\n\nDuring the late 1970s, psychologist, Yoga teacher, and organist at Culbone Church Joan D'Arcy Cooper, began to explore using the stories told by and about Jesus as spoken scripts with which to lead members of the parish through visualizations and meditations in the tradition of Affective Meditation.\n\nIn 1982, Cooper published \"Guided Meditation and the Teachings of Jesus\" in which she suggests that the words of Jesus, as recorded in the canonical gospels, may perhaps have been intended to be considered, and are enriched by hearing or reading them as Guided Meditations, through which the reader or listener can meditate upon the message and meaning inherent in the text, and thereby come to know God.\n\nWhile affective meditation is a marginal practice, Cooper's books and teachings, and the creative approach to Christian meditative practice that she encouraged, was acknowledged as making an important contribution to the New Age era and movement, characterized by a personal and individualist exploration of various meditative and contemplative traditions outside the boundaries and purview of formal doctrine and religious organizations, including those originating in Christianity, Hinduism, and Buddhism.\n"}

This association later resulted in abuses and scandals, so that councils of the fourth century forbade it. The Council of Ancyra, in 314, forbade virgins consecrated to God to live thus with men as sisters. This did not correct the practice entirely, for St. Jerome arraigns Syrian monks for living in cities with Christian virgins. The Agapetae are sometimes confounded with the \"subintroductae\", or woman who lived with clerics without marriage, a class against which the third canon of the First Council of Nicaea (325) was directed. The practice of clerics living with unrelated women was finally condemned by the First and Second Lateran Councils.\n\nThe Agapetae were also a branch of the Gnostics in the late 4th century, who held that sexual relations were only improper if the mind was impure. They taught that one should perjure himself rather than reveal the secrets of his sect.\n\n\n"}

Tauber (born 1947), Zoltan Kohn Professor Emeritus of Medicine and Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Boston University, is an American philosopher and historian of science, who, from 1993 to 2010, served as Director of the Boston University Center for Philosophy and History of Science at Boston University.\n\nSince 2004, Tauber has held a part-time visiting professorship at Tel Aviv University in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he teaches in the Cohn Institute for the History of Science and Ideas. While primarily teaching and writing in science studies and bioethics, Tauber originally trained as a biochemist and hematologist. Aside from over 125 research publications in biochemistry and cell biology, Tauber has published extensively on 19th and 20th century biomedicine, the development of modern immunology, the doctor-patient relationship, and contemporary science studies. He is the 2008 recipient of the Science Medal from the University of Bologna in Bologna, Italy and Doctor of Philosophy honoris causa from the University of Haifa in Haifa, Israel in 2011. In 2013 Tauber was appointed Chairman of the Board of Governors of the University of Haifa and is currently holding that position.\n\nTauber's key publications fall into three areas: He published the first philosophical study of contemporary immunology, \"The Immune Self: Theory or Metaphor?\" (Cambridge 1994), which became the second monograph of a quartet tracing the theoretical development of this science. In these works and various critical papers he has argued that the prevailing self/nonself paradigm inadequately models immune tolerance and over-emphasizes host defense at the expense of cooperative ecological relationships. By advocating a cognitive view of immune functions, he presents physiological autoimmunity and symbiotic relationships as alternate immune frameworks for modeling normal immunity. His \"Immunity: The Evolution of an Idea\" (Oxford 2017) summarizes this interpretation. In medical ethics, Tauber has focused on the doctor-patient relationship: In \"Confessions of a Medicine Man\" (MIT 1999), he promoted the foundational status of the ethics of medicine and thus firmly placed science and technology in the employ of the moral mandate of health care. \"Patient Autonomy and the Ethics of Responsibility\" (MIT Press 2005) extended this argument with a description of \"relational autonomy\" to define the moral status of the patient, coupled with advocacy of patient-centered medicine. His third area of interest has centered on the replacement of reified notions of science with an epistemology thoroughly melded with human-centered interests and intentions. In seeking a comprehensive understanding of scientific practice and application, Tauber argues for a \"moral epistemology\", a philosophy that builds upon the collapse of the fact/value distinction to define the interplay of various values in the diversity of science's methodologies and interpretations. More specifically, he is concerned with the nature of knowing that translates objective knowledge into personal meaning. His \"Thoreau and the Moral Agency of Knowing\" (California 2001) illustrates the composite character of personal identity that such an approach presents, one in which moral agency broadly defines personal identity. These studies have been extended in critiques of psychoanalytic portrayals of the ego that place Freud in imagined dialogues with philosophers of his own era in \"Freud, the Reluctant Philosopher\" (Princeton 2010) and with Adorno, Heidegger, and Wittgenstein in \"Requiem for the Ego\" (Stanford 2013).\n\nTauber is married to Paula Fredriksen , the William Goodwin Aurelio Professor of the Appreciation of Scripture Emerita at Boston University.\n\nAlfred Tauber's extracurricular activities focus on 1) Amuta Moshe Hess, a charity he founded, which provides services to the mentally disabled in Israel; 2) Avaloch Farm Music Institute established in Boscawen, New Hampshire to foster the development of professional chamber music ensembles and composition of new classical music ; and 3) Molad, the Center for Renewal of Israeli Democracy, where he is the Chairman of the Board .\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "2565556", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2565556", "title": "Alterity", "text": "Alterity\n\nAlterity is a philosophical and anthropological term meaning “otherness\", that is, the \"other of two\" (Latin \"alter\"). It is also increasingly being used in media to express something other than “sameness,\" an imitation compared to the original. Alterity is an encounter with \"the other.\" This “other” is not like any other worldly object or force. The perceiving subject (I myself) sees that another human being is “like me.” They act like I do, appear to be in control of their conscious life, just like me. The “other” takes me out of myself and creates new understanding, that is, alterity. Philosophically, the life of the other functions symbolically. It is in our encounter with this other life that generates the contrasts at the foundations of new consciousness. In such exchanges we are not lost, but rather the “proper self,” one’s subjectivity, scrubbed and brightly lit, becomes stained and unsure by a renewed understanding from a nonoriginal origin. Ego is still there; we do not disappear, but boundaries are less well defined. The self is opened to new experiences, and the “affair” of the other is made available.\" \n\nWithin the phenomenological tradition, alterity is usually understood as the entity in contrast to which an identity is constructed, and it implies the ability to distinguish between self and not-self, and consequently to assume the existence of an alternative viewpoint. The concept was further developed by Emmanuel Levinas in a series of essays, collected in \"Altérité et transcendence\" (\"Alterity and Transcendence\") (1995).\n\nFor Cornelius Castoriadis (\"L'institution imaginaire de la société\", 1975; \"The Imaginary Institution of Society\", 1997) radical alterity/otherness () denotes the element of creativity in history: \"For what is given in and through history is not the determined sequence of the determined but the emergence of radical otherness, immanent creation, non-trivial novelty.\"\n\nFor Jean Baudrillard (\"Figures de l'alterité\", 1994; \"Radical Alterity\", 2008), alterity is a precious and transcendent element and its loss would seriously impoverish a world culture of increasing sameness and \"arrogant, insular cultural narcissism.\"\n\nGayatri Chakravorty Spivak's theory of alterity was introduced in a 2014 symposium titled Remaking History, the intention of which was to challenge the masculine orthodoxy of history writing.\n\nAccording to Spivak, it is imperative for one to uncover the histories and inherent historical behaviors in order to exercise an individual right to authentic experience, identity and reality. Within the concept of socially constructed histories one \"must take into account the dangerous fragility and tenacity of these concept-metaphors.\"\n\nSpivak recalls her personal history: \"As a postcolonial, I am concerned with the appropriation of 'alternative history' or 'histories'. I am not a historian by training. I cannot claim disciplinary expertise in remaking history in the sense or rewriting it. But I can be used as an example of how historical narratives are negotiated. The parents of my parents' grandparents' grandparents were made over, not always without their consent, by the political, fiscal and educational intervention of British imperialism, and now I am independent. Thus I am, in the strictest sense, a postcolonial.\"\n\nSpivak explains four \"master words\" to identify the modes of being that create alterity: \"Nationalism, Internationalism, Secularism and Culturalism.\" Furthermore, tools for developing alternative histories include: \"gender, race, ethnicity, class\".\n\nJeffery Nealon, in \"Alterity Politics: Ethics and Performative Subjectivity\", argues that \"ethics is constituted as an inexorable affirmative response to different identities, not through an inability to understand or totalize the other.\"\n\nThere is included a long article on alterity in the University of Chicago's \"Theories of Media: Keywords Glossary\" by Joshua Wexler. Wexler writes: \"Given the various theorists formulations presented here, the mediation of alterity or otherness in the world provides a space for thinking about the complexities of self and other and the formation of identity.\"\n\nThe concept of alterity is also being used in theology and in spiritual books meant for general readers. This is not out of place because, for believers in the Judeo-Christian tradition, God is the ultimate 'Other'. Alterity has also been used to describe the goal of many Christians, to become themselves deeply \"other\" than the usual norms of behavior and patterns of thought of the secular culture at large. Enzo Bianchi in \"Echoes of the Word\" expresses this well, \"Meditation always seeks to open us to alterity, love and communion by guiding us toward the goal of having in ourselves the same attitude and will that were in Christ Jesus.\"\n\nJadranka Skorin-Kapov in \"The Aesthetics of Desire and Surprise: Phenomenology and Speculation\", relates alterity or otherness to newness and surprise, \"The signification of the encounter with otherness is not in its novelty (or banal newness); on the contrary, newness has signification because it reveals otherness, because it allows the experience of otherness. Newness is related to surprise, it is a consequence of the encounter... Metaphysical desire is the acceptivity of irreducible otherness. Surprise is the consequence of the encounter. Between desire and surprise there is a pause, a void, a rupture, an immediacy that cannot be captured and presented.”\n\nIn anthropology, alterity has been used by scholars such as Nicholas Dirks, Johannes Fabian, Michael Taussig and Pauline Turner Strong to refer to the construction of \"cultural others\".\n\nThe term has gained further use in seemingly somewhat remote disciplines, e.g., historical musicology where it is employed by John Michael Cooper in a study of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Felix Mendelssohn.\n\n"}

The subject of anger is treated in a range of Jewish sources, from the Bible and Talmud, to Halacha, Kabbalah, Hasidism and contemporary Jewish sources.\n\nIn the Book of Genesis, Jacob condemned the anger that had arisen in his sons Simon and Levi: \"Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel.\"\n\nSome bible commentators point to God's punishment of Moses, not allowing him to enter the land of Israel, as being due to Moses's anger at the Jewish People.\n\nRestraining oneself from anger is seen as noble and desirable, as Ethics of the Fathers states:\n\n\"Ben Zoma said:\nWho is strong? He who subdues his evil inclination, as it is stated,\n'He who is slow to anger is better than a strong man, and he who masters his passions is better than one who conquers a city' (Proverbs 16:32).\"\n\nElsewhere, \"Rabbi Eliezer says... Do not be easy to anger.\"\n\nThe Talmud also emphasizes the negative effect anger has on a person.\n\nThe Talmud links anger to conceit, stating “One who is angry does not even consider the presence of Hashem important.\"\n\nIn its section dealing with ethical traits a person should adopt, Rabbi Shlomo Ganzfried in his \"Kitzur Shulchan Aruch\" states: \"Anger is also a very evil trait and it should be avoided at all costs. You should train yourself not to become angry even if you have a good reason to be angry.\"\n\nRabbi Chaim Vital taught in the name of his master, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, the Arizal, that anger may be dispelled by immersing in a ritual bath (\"mikvah\") twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. While immersing, one should meditate on the idea that the numerical value (\"gematria\") of the Hebrew word \"\"mikvah\" () (ritual bath) is the same as the Hebrew word for anger (\"ka'as\", ).\n\nThe Rabbi Yisroel Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, taught that anger may dispelled by the emphasis on love for God and joy in performing the commandments.\n\nRabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi interprets the parallel between anger and idol worship stems from the feelings of the one who has become angry typically coincides with a disregard of Divine Providence – whatever had caused the anger was ultimately ordained from God – through coming to anger one thereby denies the hand of God in one's life. \n\nRabbi Harold Kushner finds no grounds for anger toward God because “our misfortunes are none of His doing.” In contrast to Kushner’s reading of the Bible, David Blumenthal finds an “abusing God” whose “sometimes evil” actions evoke vigorous protest, but without severing the protester’s relationship with God.\n\nIn a teaching attributed to Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, when anger is a mode of life or when expressed in an unjustified manner, is prohibited by Judaism. But if a person is wronged, he or she is allowed to express their natural feelings, including anger.\n\n"}

This asana is particularly beneficial to the external rotators and stabilizers of the hip including gluteus medius and minimus, obturators (external and internal) and gemelli (inferior and superior). Abduction of the hip is achieved through concentric contraction of tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius and minimus on both legs (lifting one and stabilizing the other). Both legs engage articularis genus, hip flexors and quadriceps to maintain leg extension,to relax,help in improvement in sports, while the supporting leg stretches the gastrocnemius, hamstrings and gluteus maximus. Upper body stability is achieved by a number of paraspinal and core muscles like the abdominals and obliques (external and internal), while the chest is opened by the rhomboids, and trapezius and the arms are abducted by the deltoids, externally rotated by the infraspinatus and stabilized by the latissimus dorsi.\n\n\nIn Sivananda Yoga and its derivative styles such as the Bihar school, half moon pose refers to anjaneyasana, an asana used in the moon salutation series (Chandra Namaskar).

{"id": "16707204", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=16707204", "title": "Artificial stupidity", "text": "Artificial stupidity\n\nArtificial stupidity is a phrase most commonly used as a humorous retort to the notion of artificial intelligence (AI). It is a derogatory reference to the inability of an AI program to adequately perform basic tasks. The term has appeared in connection with other subject areas, mostly related to computing technology but also with respect to human behaviour.\n\nSadie Plant suggests that Ada Lovelace, the nineteenth century prophetess of computing, employed something like artificial stupidity to criticize those who underestimated the future potential for calculating machines. Hito Steyerl has been applying the term with reference to the stupidity of not recognizing the power and dangers of algorithms because of their invisibility. On a different note, artificial stupidity, for Avital Ronell, describes the shocking misuse of intelligence measurement during the eugenics era in the USA: people were artificially deemed unintelligent.\n\nArtist and researcher Micheál O'Connell employed the term \"artificial stupidity\" for his doctoral thesis with reference both to questions of human intelligence and technological intelligence. Artificial stupidity can refer to the human ability to \"act stupid\" or \"dumb down\" but he suggests that it can also be a means of creative unearthing. He cites John Roberts' attention to contemporary artists and their use of a \"thinking stupidity\" as a \"rejection of the dominant discourses\". A suggestion is that one reason for the resilience of the \"art system\" is its cunning inverse pretentiousness; on its own art seems stupid from the point of view of utilitarian interests, commerce, entertainment, academia and political agendas. As well as discussing art and creativity O'Connell advocates for a readdressing of the significance of human intelligence against, the often palpable, stupidity of the technological sphere including AI (understood in the broadest sense). And \"artificial stupidity'\"s most valid usage relates to examples of the obvious faultiness of AI technologies and systems. Finally within the field of computer science, \"artificial stupidity\" has one other significant application: it refers to a technique of deliberately dumbing down computer programs in order to introduce errors in their responses.\n\nAlan Turing, in his 1952 paper \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\", proposed a test for intelligence which has since become known as the Turing test. While there are a number of different versions, the original test, described by Turing as being based on the \"Imitation Game\", involved a \"machine intelligence\" (a computer running an AI program), a female participant, and an interrogator. Both the AI and the female participant were to claim that they were female, and the interrogator's task was to work out which was the female participant and which was not by examining the participant's responses to typed questions. While it is not clear whether or not Turing intended that the interrogator was to know that one of the participants was a computer, while discussing some of the possible objections to his argument Turing raised the concern that \"machines cannot make mistakes\".\n\nAs Turing then noted, the reply to this is a simple one: the machine should \"not\" attempt to \"give the \"right\" answers to the arithmetic problems\". Instead, deliberate errors should be introduced to the computer's responses.\n\nWithin computer science, there are at least two major applications for artificial stupidity: the generation of deliberate errors in chatbots attempting to pass the Turing test or to otherwise fool a participant into believing that they are human; and the deliberate limitation of computer AIs in video games in order to control the game's difficulty.\n\nThe first Loebner prize competition was run in 1991. As reported in \"The Economist\", the winning entry incorporated deliberate errors – described by \"The Economist\" as \"artificial stupidity\" – to fool the judges into believing that it was human. This technique has remained a part of the subsequent Loebner prize competitions, and reflects the issue first raised by Turing.\n\nLars Lidén argues that good game design involves finding a balance between the computer's \"intelligence\" and the player's ability to win. By finely tuning the level of \"artificial stupidity\", it is possible to create computer controlled plays that allow the player to win, but do so \"without looking unintelligent\".\n\n\"Algorithms\"\n\nThere are many ways to deliberately introduce poor decision-making in search algorithms. Take the minimax algorithm for example. The minimax algorithm is an adversarial search algorithm that is popularly used in games that require more than one player to compete against each other. The main purpose in this algorithm is to choose a move that maximizes your chance of winning and avoid moves that maximizes the chance of your opponent winning. An algorithm like this would be extremely beneficial to the computer as computers are able to search thousands of moves ahead. To \"dumb down\" this algorithm to allow for different difficulty levels, heuristic functions have to be tweaked. Normally, huge points are given in winning states. Tweaking the heuristic by reducing such big payoffs would reduce the chance of the algorithm in choosing the winning state.\n\nCreating heuristic functions to allow for stupidity is more difficult than one might think. If a heuristic allows for the best move, the computer opponent would be too omniscient, making the game frustrating and unenjoyable. But if the heuristic is poor, the game might also be unenjoyable. Therefore, a balance of good moves and bad moves in an adversarial game relies on a well-implemented heuristic function.\n\nAccording to its definition, a sufficiently developed Artificial Stupidity program would be able to make all the worst cases regarding a given situation. This would enable computer programmers and analysts to find flaws immediately while minimizing errors that are within the code.\n\nHowever, it is mostly expected to be used within the development and debugging stages of computer software.\n\nThe Economist states that if we are to achieve Alan Turing's prediction, \"it will be a dreadful anticlimax.\" It is a much pointless attempt to create a machine that mimics the behaviour and intelligent level of a human being. The purpose of the invention of the computer is to assist humans in performing tasks that would be deemed too tedious or time consuming to perform by hand.\n\nAs mentioned in the passage regarding the Loebnizer prize competition, the computer was able to trick judges by introducing deliberate typing errors. The Economist argues that nobody would want a computer that couldn't type properly.\n\nDurham, T., an author of the journal \"On Artificial Stupidity,\" seems to view computers as naturally possessing intelligence. It is only due to bad programming that a computer appears unintelligent. Durham states the opposite in what people would normally believe as \"there is no such thing as AI, only artificial stupidity, which is what happens when computers are not given the knowledge they need.\"\n\nArtificial stupidity is not just delivering deliberate errors into the computer, but it could also be seen as a limitation of computer artificial intelligence. Dr. Jay Liebowitz argues that \"if intelligence and stupidity naturally exist, and if AI is said to exist, then is there something that might be called \"artificial stupidity?\"\"\n\nLiebowitz pointed out that the limitations are:\n\n"}

To be charged with the odious title of \"atheism\" one must have the notion of God and reject it.\" In the period of the Enlightenment, avowed and open atheism was made possible by the advance of religious toleration, but was also far from encouraged. \n\nAccusations of atheism were common, but most of the people suspected by their peers of atheism were not actually atheist. D'Holbach and Denis Diderot seem to be two of the very small number of publicly identified atheists in Europe during this period. Thomas Hobbes was widely viewed as an atheist for his materialist interpretation of scripture—Henry Hammond, a former friend, described him in a letter as a \"Christian Atheist.\" David Hume was accused of atheism for his writings on the \"natural history of religion\"; Pierre Bayle was accused of atheism for defending the possibility of an ethical atheist society in his \"Critical Dictionary\"; and Baruch Spinoza was frequently regarded as an atheist for his \"pantheism.\" However, all three of these figures defended themselves against such accusations.\n\nIn the Reformation and Counter-Reformation eras, Europe was a \"persecuting society,\" which did not tolerate religious minorities or atheism. Even in France, where the Edict of Nantes had been issued in 1598, then revoked in 1685, there was very little support for religious toleration at the beginning of the eighteenth century. States were concerned with maintaining religious uniformity for two reasons: first, they believed that their chosen confession was the way to God and other religions were heretical, and second, religious unity was necessary for social and political stability. The advancement of toleration was the result of pragmatic political motives as well as the principles espoused by Enlightenment \"philosophes\".\nReligion was a central topic of conversation during much of the eighteenth century. It was the subject of debate in the coffeehouses and debate societies of Enlightenment Europe, and a bone of contention among the \"philosophes\". Michael J. Buckley describes the rise of toleration, and of atheism itself, as a response to religious violence in the preceding years: the expulsion of the Huguenots from France, the Spanish inquisition, the witch trials, the civil wars of England, Scotland and the Netherlands. Buckley argues that \"religious warfare had irrevocably discredited confessional primacy in the growing secularized sensitivity of much of European culture.\" This is a view echoed by Ole Peter Brell and Ray Porter. Marisa Linton, however, points out that it was a common conception that religious diversity would lead to unrest and possibly civil war.\n\nAccording to Justin Champion, the question in England was not one of determining religious truth, whether or not there was a god, but rather one of understanding how the priesthood had gained the power to determine what was accepted as truth. Republican radicals like Henry Stubbe, Charles Blount and John Toland understood religion as a social and cultural institution, rather than as transcendent principles. They were primarily motivated by priestly fraud or \"priestcraft.\" The second half of Thomas Hobbes' book Leviathan contains an example of this sort of anticlerical thought. Hobbes, like Toland and other anticlerical writers of the period, understood religion in terms of history. By viewing religious truth and the church as separate, they helped open the way for further religious dissent.\n\nBecause France was an absolutist monarchy in which the king was seen as ruling by divine right, it was generally thought that French people had to share his religious views. The Edict of Nantes, which granted toleration to the Huguenot minority in France, was revoked in 1685. Marisa Linton argues that while the \"philosophes\" did contribute to some extent to the rise of French toleration, the activities of French Huguenots also played a part: they began to worship more publicly in the more remote regions of France, and their continued loyalty to the French crown on the eve of and during the Seven Years' War may have helped to ease the monarch's suspicions about their faith. In the mid-eighteenth century, Jansenist intellectuals began campaigning for religious toleration for Calvinists. Linton argues that together, these causes shifted public opinion towards religious toleration. Religious toleration was not accepted by everyone; for instance, Abbé Houtteville condemned the rise of toleration in France because it weakened ecclesiastical authority and encouraged irreligion. However, in 1787 Louis XVI granted an Edict of Toleration acknowledging their civil rights to marry and own property, although they were still denied the official right to worship and could not hold public office or become teachers. Full religious toleration for Protestants would not be granted until the French Revolution.\n\nToleration itself boiled down to two different factions. The \"acceptable face\" of toleration was essentially the mainstream view, the freedom of worship and peaceful coexistence of different churches. This view was supported by Kant, Locke, Voltaire and Hume, as the public face of the Enlightenment. The Radical Enlightenment, on the other hand, was the view of toleration where the radicals demanded freedom of thought and expression, rather than existing peacefully among each other. This movement was shaped by the lesser-known figures of d'Holbach, Diderot, Condorcet, and, in particular, Spinoza, who provided the heart and soul of this faction. Where reason reigned supreme for the radicals, the moderate thinkers maintained that reason must be limited by faith and tradition. Together, the two different views of Enlightenment forged powerfully contrasting notions of toleration.\n\nThe Dutch Jew Spinoza argued for individual freedom to express personal beliefs, while discouraging large congregations unless they belonged to a somewhat deistic idealized state religion. According to Spinoza, freedom of thought, speech and expression were the core values of toleration—as such, Spinoza opposed censorship. Jonathan Israel summarized his position, that anti-toleration laws were engineered \"for personal advantage but also at great cost to the state and the public,\" and that they exacerbated religious conflict rather than diminishing it. Spinoza constructed his theories about toleration based on a freedom to think rather than the right to worship, and was established according to philosophical principles rather than being based on any interpretation of scripture. Consequently, Spinoza was essentially arguing for everyone, atheists, Catholics and Jews included.\n\nPierre Bayle was a strong advocate of tolerance, the basis of a quarrel with Louis XIV. He even defended the idea of an ethical atheist society in his famous dictionary. Martin Fitzpatrick credits him with making a \"powerful contribution to the way \"philosophes\" would wage war on intolerance and superstition.\" Although he wanted to diminish the influence of Spinoza, Bayle was treated in a similar fashion by the Huguenots of the United Provinces, who saw him as a dangerous thinker and a potential atheist.\n\nJohn Locke suggested a pragmatic view of toleration, although he advanced a concept of toleration only between certain Christian sects. He vehemently denied the atheists' right to toleration since they did not believe in a god, practiced no recognizable form of worship, and were not seeking to save their souls. He similarly denied toleration to Catholics on the grounds that papal authority made them a danger to the state. In essence, Locke advanced a freedom of worship, not a freedom of thought. The vast majority of eighteenth-century writers, like Locke, had no interest in granting religious tolerance to ideas that deviated from the core of revealed religion. Most of these writers were strongly opposed to Spinoza's ideal of toleration, which is \"chiefly about individual freedom and decidedly not the freedom of large ecclesiastical structures to impose themselves on society.\"\n\nVoltaire, in his 1763 \"A Treatise on Toleration\", continued in the tradition of John Locke, arguing that toleration allowed communication and good relationships between differing confessions in the marketplace. Allowing the Huguenots to return to France would boost the French economy. He would not be the only one to espouse this viewpoint.\n\nOpponents tended to conflate the views of those who wrote in favour of toleration under the heading of dangerous anti-orthodoxy and atheism, despite their radically differing viewpoints and confessions.\n\nDeism is the philosophical belief in a deity based on reason rather than religious revelation or dogma. It was a popular perception among the \"philosophes\", who adopted deistic attitudes to varying degrees. Deism, in this respect, is very different from atheism, which denies the existence of a deity altogether. Voltaire, for instance, was convinced that the existence of god was a demonstrable fact. The deistic god, however, often bore little resemblance to the God of Christian scripture, which meant that deists were often heavily criticized by the adherents of confessional faiths and could be accused of atheism.\n\nDeists often pushed for religious toleration, a move which would have supported the open expression of atheism. This is not because they supported atheism—they did not—but because deist philosophers tended to be in favour of the civil freedom of conscience. As Michael J. Buckley writes, \"If atheism was unacceptable, superstition and fanaticism were even more so.\" Deists were not pro-atheist, but their anticlerical leanings indirectly benefited the evolution of atheism.\n\nIn historiographical terms, it has been quite common to see a close link between deism and atheism. Buckley critiques Peter Gay's view of the direct tie between deism and atheism, writing, \"the vectors which Gay charts are certainly there, but the distinction may be somewhat too neat, too overdrawn.\" Louis Dupré describes the deism as \"the result of a filtering process that had strained off all historical and dogmatic data from Christian theology and retained only that minimum which, by eighteenth-century standards, reason demands.\" Atheism is perhaps the same process taken a step further. Buckley credits the rise of atheism with the gradual submission of theology to philosophy—as thinkers, including church leaders, began to argue religion on philosophical terms, they opened the way for disbelief—they made atheism thinkable. Deism is, in this perspective, a complicated waypoint on the path to atheism: deism is the philosophical belief in a deity based on reason. Once belief in god is based on reason, it becomes thinkable to reason one's way into disbelief.\n\nFreemasons in continental Europe during the Enlightenment era were accused of atheism. The masonic \"Constitutions\" of 1723 are vague on the matter of religion, stating that if a Freemason \"rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irreligious Libertine,\" while also asking that he follow \"that religion to which all men agree, leaving their particular opinions to themselves.\" Although Masonic literature referred sporadically and vaguely to a \"Grand Architect of the Universe,\" their secretive practices made the religious affiliation of each Freemason a matter of speculation. \n\nFreemasonic culture originated in Britain and spread to the Continent, bringing with it ideas about natural rights and the rights of the governed. In some areas, Continental Freemasonry may have drawn from more subversive English sources. Margaret C. Jacob outlines a relationship between John Toland and Dutch Freemasonry; Jean Rousset de Missy, the founder of the Masonic lodge in the Dutch Republic in 1735 was a self-described pantheist, borrowing the term coined by Toland. Jacob argues that \"there is a streak of freethinking or deism that turns up at moments in the history of Continental Freemasonry right into, and especially during, the 1790s.\" This religious ambiguity could be interpreted as contributing to the \"thinkability\" of atheism.\n\nBaruch Spinoza (1632–1677), in his 1670 \"Theologico-Political Treatise\", criticized Judaism (his birth religion) and all organized religion. His philosophical orientation is often called \"pantheism,\" a term coined by John Toland after Spinoza's death. However, in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Spinoza's name was often associated with atheism, freethinking, materialism, deism, and any other heterodox religious belief. Whether or not \"pantheism\" constitutes atheism is still debated by modern scholars.\n\nPierre Bayle (1647–1706) was widely accused of atheism for his espousal of religious toleration, although he professed himself a Huguenot. He encountered a great deal of criticism for defending atheism. In his \"Dictionnaire historique et critique\" he stated that while atheists were \"exceedingly blind and ignorant of the nature of things\" there were many atheists \"who are no way distinguished for their vices,\" and that \"if atheists exist, who, morally speaking, are well-disposed, it follows that Atheism is not a necessary cause of immorality, but simply an incidental one in regard to those who would have been immoral from disposition or temperament, whether Atheists or not.\" In response to criticism, he included an essay \"Clarifications: On Atheists\" in the 1702 edition of the Dictionary. In it, he continued defending his thesis that \"there have been atheists and Epicureans whose propriety in moral matters has surpassed that of most idolators\", arguing that religion is not the sole basis of morality. It is, he wrote, \"a very likely possibility that some men without religion are more motivated to lead a decent, moral life by their constitution, in conjunction with the love of praise and the fear of disgrace, than are some others by the instincts of conscience.\"\n\nDavid Hume (1711–1776) was often seen as an atheist in his own day. His skeptical attitude toward religion in such works as \"Of Superstition and Religion\", \"Essays Moral and Political\", \"On Suicide\", \"On the Immortality of the Soul\", \"Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion\", as well as his death-bed conversations with Boswell (later published), earned Hume the reputation as a practicing atheist. Hume was even turned down for a teaching position at the University of Edinburgh in the 1740s because of his alleged atheism.\n\nDenis Diderot (1713–1784) was one of the central guests of D'Holbach's salon and the primary editor of the \"Encyclopédie\". Although Diderot wrote extensively about atheism, he was not as polemic as D'Holbach or Naigeon—instead of publishing his atheistic works, he tended to circulate them among his friends or give them to Naigeon for posthumous publishing. Diderot espoused a materialist worldview. He attempted to solve the problems of how the cosmos could begin without a creator, and theorized about how life could come from inorganic matter. According to Dupré, Diderot concluded that if one abandons \"the unproved principle that the cosmos must have a beginning\" then the need to establish the \"efficient cause\" of creation is no longer a problem. Diderot thought that the origin of life might be a process of the natural internal evolution of matter.\n\nThe Baron D'Holbach (1723–1789) was the central figure of the 'coterie holbachique' and the salon he hosted in his Paris home. The salon has been interpreted as a meeting place for Parisian atheists, based on an anecdote in which D'Holbach told David Hume, who claimed not to believe anything, that of the eighteen guests at his salon, fifteen were atheists and three had not yet decided. There is some doubt as to the accuracy of this statement. In any case, D'Holbach himself was a professed atheist. The salon was the site of a great deal of discussion about atheism, and the atheistic and theistic guests seem to have spent a great deal of time good-naturedly arguing for their respective positions. Despite claims that the salon was a hotbed of atheism, there seem to only have been three convinced atheists in regular attendance: D'Holbach, Denis Diderot and Jacques-André Naigeon. \n\nD'Holbach's written works often included atheistic themes. Alan Charles Kors cites three in particular, \"Système de la Nature\", \"Le Bon-sens\" and \"La Morale Universelle\" as being particularly concerned with advancing the cause of atheism. Kors summarized some of the basic themes of these three texts as the idea that rigorous materialism was the only coherent viewpoint, and that \"the only humane and beneficial morality was one deduced from the imperatives for the happiness and survival of mankind.\" What was relatively unique about D'Holbach was that, as Kors writes, he \"was an atheist, and he proselytized.\"\n\nAlthough the \"Encyclopédie\" (published 1751–1772) was driven and edited by the atheist Denis Diderot, the Encyclopedia's articles on atheism and atheists take an incredibly negative tone, having been written by the pastor Jean-Henri-Samuel Formey and the abbé Claude Yvon. This was probably the most common conception of atheism by the public and by some of the \"philosophes\". Yvon identifies the main causes of atheism as ignorance and stupidity, and debauchery and the corruption of morals. The article \"Athées\" is primarily concerned with refuting Bayle's assertions, insisting that atheists \"cannot have an exact and complete understanding of the morality of human actions.\"\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11252905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11252905", "title": "Biblical manuscript", "text": "Biblical manuscript\n\nA biblical manuscript is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the Bible. The word \"Bible\" comes from the Greek \"biblia\" (books); \"manuscript\" comes from Latin \"manu\" (hand) and \"scriptum\" (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see Tefillin) to huge polyglot codices (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh) and the New Testament, as well as extracanonical works.\n\nThe study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of textual criticism attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the invention of the printing press.\n\nThe Aleppo Codex (c. 920 CE) and Leningrad Codex (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the Tanakh. In 1947 CE the finding of the Dead Sea scrolls at Qumran pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the Old Testament were in Greek in manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the Book of Esther; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two scrolls of the Book of Isaiah, one complete (1QIs), and one around 75% complete (1QIs). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.\n\nThe New Testament has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work of literature, with over 5,800 complete or fragmented Greek manuscripts catalogued, 10,000 Latin manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including Syriac, Slavic, Gothic, Ethiopic, Coptic and Armenian. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.\n\nOften, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them. There were several options. The first was to simply \"wash\" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called palimpsests and were very common in the ancient world until the Middle Ages. One notable palimpsest is the Archimedes Palimpsest. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity; burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of Oxyrhynchus 840). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at Saint Catherine's Monastery in the Sinai (the source of the Codex Sinaiticus), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside Bethlehem, they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines, possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing folios would also be placed in the caches. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.\n\nComplete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a manuscript might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the parchment, script used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.\n\nDue to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.\n\nThe task of copying manuscripts was generally done by scribes who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and illumination called the scriptorium came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.\n\nAn important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on papyrus, made from a reed that grew abundantly in the Nile Delta. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century. Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of , no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page. Beginning in the fourth century, parchment (also called vellum) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts. It wasn't until the twelfth century that paper (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century China, began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.\n\nOf the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of scrolls; however, eight Christian manuscripts are codices. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians. The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the Pauline epistles), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages. On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come. Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles. \"Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions.\"\n\nThe handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between uncial script (or majuscule) and minuscule. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the baseline and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had ascenders and descenders that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.\n\nThe earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters (scriptio continua), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the \"nomina sacra\". Yet another method involved the palimpsest, a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example \"Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus\" and the \"Syriac Sinaiticus\").\n\nThe original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or verse and chapter divisions. These were developed over the years as \"helps for readers\". The Eusebian Canons were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings (κεφαλαία) were used.\n\nManuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich illuminated manuscript tradition, including the famous Irish Gospel Books, the \"Book of Kells\" and the \"Book of Durrow\".\n\nDesiderius Erasmus compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, Johann Jakob Wettstein was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used (uncial, minuscule) or format (lectionaries) and based on content (Gospels, Pauline letters, Acts + General epistles, and Revelation). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.\n\nFor manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as Codex Alexandrinus (A) and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. Constantin von Tischendorf found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, Codex Sinaiticus, over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter aleph (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the Latin alphabet had been used, and scholars moved on to first the Greek alphabet, and eventually started reusing characters by adding a superscript. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.\n\nHermann, Freiherr von Soden published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10. He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.\n\nCaspar René Gregory published another cataloging system in 1908 in \"Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments\", which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and lectionaries. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material (papyrus) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.\n\nGregory assigned the papyri a prefix of P, often written in blackletter script (), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (\"e.g.\" Codex Claromontanus is assigned both 06 and D). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with l often written in script (ℓ). Kurt Aland continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as \"Gregory-Aland numbers\". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are , 0323, 2928, and \"ℓ\" 2463. Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (\"i.e.\" the Magdalen papyrus has both the numbers of and ).\n\nThe majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called \"versions\") and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the Church Fathers. In the critical apparatus of the Novum Testamentum Graece, a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for Vulgate, lat for Latin, sy for Sinaitic Palimpsest, sy for Curetonian Gospels, sy for the Peshitta, co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).\n\nThe New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books are not known to have survived. The autographs are believed to have been lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. Paleography, a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a radiocarbon dating test requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process. Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.\n\nThe earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the Gospel of John, Rylands Library Papyrus P52, which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the Codex Sinaiticus dates to the 4th century. The following table lists the earliest extant manuscript witnesses for the books of the New Testament.\nPalaeography is the study of ancient writing, and textual criticism is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.\n\nNone of the original documents of the New Testament is known to scholars to be extant; and the existing manuscripts differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original. The New Testament has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE Alexandrian text-type, the Western text-type, and the Byzantine text-type, which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.\n\nSince the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no \"a priori\" bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the Novum Testamentum Graece, which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In textual criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored in these two publications; and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition. Most English translations of the New Testament made in the 20th Century were based on these copies.\n\nTextual scholar Bart D. Ehrman writes: \"It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament...\" In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, Bruce M. Metzger wrote,\n\nBiblical scholar Gary Habermas adds, \n\nEvery year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in Albania; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars. There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century). If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript, (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see Codex Vaticanus, Codex Alexandrinus, et al.). The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries. More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by scribes, and are easily identified as such: an omitted word, a duplicate line, a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, harmonizations between readings, or ideologically motivated. Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the Novum Testamentum Graece, which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.\n\n\n\n\n"}

This set of functions in effect determines a topology (connectivity) on the set of variables, which then become nodes in a network. Usually, the dynamics of the system is taken as a discrete time series where the state of the entire network at time \"t\"+1 is determined by evaluating each variable's function on the state of the network at time \"t\". This may be done synchronously or asynchronously.\n\nBoolean networks have been used in biology to model regulatory networks. Although Boolean networks are a crude simplification of genetic reality where genes are not simple binary switches, there are several cases where they correctly capture the correct pattern of expressed and suppressed genes. \nThe seemingly mathematical easy (synchronous) model was only fully understood in the mid 2000s.\n\nA Boolean network is a particular kind of sequential dynamical system, where time and states are discrete, i.e. both the set of variables and the set of states in the time series each have a bijection onto an integer series. Such systems are like cellular automata on networks, except for the fact that when they are set up each node has a rule that is randomly chosen from all \"2\" possible ones with \"s\" inputs. With \"s=2\" class 2 behavior tends to dominate. But for \"s>2\", the behavior one sees quickly approaches what is typical for a random mapping in which the network representing the evolution of the \"2\" states of the \"m\" underlying nodes is itself connected essentially randomly.\n\nA random Boolean network (RBN) is one that is randomly selected from the set of all possible boolean networks of a particular size, \"N\". One then can study statistically, how the expected properties of such networks depend on various statistical properties of the ensemble of all possible networks. For example, one may study how the RBN behavior changes as the average connectivity is changed.\n\nThe first Boolean networks were proposed by Stuart A. Kauffman in 1969, as random models of genetic regulatory networks but their mathematical understanding only started in the 2000s.\n\nSince a Boolean network has only 2 possible states, a trajectory will sooner or later reach a previously visited state, and thus, since the dynamics are deterministic, the trajectory will fall into a steady state or cycle called an attractor (though in the broader field of dynamical systems a cycle is only an attractor if perturbations from it lead back to it). If the attractor has only a single state it is called a \"point attractor\", and if the attractor consists of more than one state it is called a \"cycle attractor\". The set of states that lead to an attractor is called the \"basin\" of the attractor. States which occur only at the beginning of trajectories (no trajectories lead \"to\" them), are called \"garden-of-Eden\" states and the dynamics of the network flow from these states towards attractors. The time it takes to reach an attractor is called \"transient time\".\n\nWith growing computer power and increasing understanding of the seemingly simple model, different authors gave different estimates for the mean number and length of the attractors, here a brief summary of key publications.\nIn dynamical systems theory, the structure and length of the attractors of a network corresponds to the dynamic phase of the network. The stability of Boolean networks depends on the connections of their nodes. A Boolean network can exhibit stable, critical or chaotic behavior. This phenomenon is governed by a critical value of the average number of connections of nodes (formula_1), and can be characterized by the Hamming distance as distance measure. In the unstable regime, the distance between two initially close states on average grows exponentially in time, while in the stable regime it decreases exponentially. In this, with \"initially close states\" one means that the Hamming distance is small compared with the number of nodes (formula_2) in the network.\n\nFor N-K-model the network is stable if formula_3, critical if formula_4, and unstable if formula_5.\n\nThe state of a given node formula_6 is updated according to its truth table, whose outputs are randomly populated. formula_7 denotes the probability of assigning an off output to a given series of input signals.\n\nIf formula_8 for every node, the transition between the stable and chaotic range depends on formula_9. The critical value of the average number of connections is formula_10.\n\nIf formula_11 is not constant, and there is no correlation between the in-degrees and out-degrees, the conditions of stability is determined by formula_12 The network is stable if formula_13, critical if formula_14, and unstable if formula_15.\n\nThe conditions of stability are the same in the case of networks with scale-free topology where the in-and out-degree distribution is a power-law distribution: formula_16, and formula_17, since every out-link from a node is an in-link to another.\n\nSensitivity shows the probability that the output of the Boolean function of a given node changes if its input changes. For random Boolean networks,\nformula_18. In the general case, stability of the network is governed by the largest eigenvalue formula_19 of matrix formula_20, where formula_21, and formula_22 is the adjacency matrix of the network. The network is stable if formula_23, critical if formula_24, unstable if formula_25.\n\nOne theme is to study different underlying graph topologies.\n\nClassical Boolean networks (sometimes called CRBN, i.e. Classic Random Boolean Network) are synchronously updated. Motivated by the fact that genes don't usually change their state simultaneously, different alternatives have been introduced. A common classification is the following:\n\n\n\n\n"}

At Yale he studied under the tutelage of Wilfred Sellars and Richard Bernstein. Concomitantly, as a graduate student, he studied at Heidelberg University under Karl Löwith, Dieter Henrich and Hans-Georg Gadamer, and at University of Paris under Paul Ricœur.\n\nProfessor Carr's research, publication and teaching have been devoted to various aspects of Edmund Husserl's philosophy and to phenomenology in general. He is particularly attentive to the philosophy of history. The latter inquiry has led him to explore the nature of narrative, and has thus intersected with literary theory, Hegel's phenomenology, and analytic theories of history. Carr's work is explicitly opposed to that of Louis Mink, Hayden White, and Roland Barthes; Carr considered the basis of narrative structure to inhere in the human phenomenology of experience, even if not in what he described as \"merely physical\" events. Moreover, his research interests fall on the nature of transcendental philosophy, both in Husserl and in Kant.\nHe is a former Executive Secretary and Board Member of the Society for Phenomenology and Existential Philosophy, and serves on the editorial boards of the philosophical series published by Indiana University Press and Northwestern University Press, and by Springer Verlag.\nIn retirement Carr has lectured on Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty at The New School for Social Research, and on Husserl's notion of “so etwas wie Leiblichkeit”—\"something like corporality\"—at Freie Universität Berlin. He was the doctoral advisor of Margret Grebowicz.\n\nAmong Professor Carr's publications are five books—\"Phenomenology and the Problem of History\" (1974), \"Interpreting Husserl\" (1987), \"Time, Narrative and History\" (1991), \"The Paradox of Subjectivity\" (1999), and \"Experience and History: Phenomenological Perspectives on the Historical World\" (2014), a number of edited or co-edited collections, and the English translation of the major work of the late Husserl, \"The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology\".

{"id": "46335840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=46335840", "title": "Discourse of power", "text": "Discourse of power\n\nThe discourse of power is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of power due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.\nThe idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.\n\nThose with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself. The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that \"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,\" has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.\n\n\nThese media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.\n\nThe shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a hegemonic form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest. The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.\n\nSocial construct examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently. It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of. We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media. Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.\n\nExperienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture. Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.\n\nSymbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome personal boundaries including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person. Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language. Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.\n"}
{"id": "621169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=621169", "title": "Existence of God", "text": "Existence of God\n\nThe existence of God is a subject of debate in the philosophy of religion and popular culture.\n\nA wide variety of arguments for and against the existence of God can be categorized as metaphysical, logical, empirical, or subjective. In philosophical terms, the question of the existence of God involves the disciplines of epistemology (the nature and scope of knowledge) and ontology (study of the nature of being, existence, or reality) and the theory of value (since some definitions of God include \"perfection\").\n\nThe Western tradition of philosophical discussion of the existence of God began with Plato and Aristotle, who made arguments that would now be categorized as cosmological. Other arguments for the existence of God have been proposed by St. Anselm, who formulated the first ontological argument; Ibn Rushd (Averroes) and Thomas Aquinas, who presented their own versions of the cosmological argument (the \"kalam\" argument and the first way, respectively); René Descartes, who said that the existence of a benevolent God is logically necessary for the evidence of the senses to be meaningful. John Calvin argued for a \"sensus divinitatis\", which gives each human a knowledge of God's existence.\n\nPhilosophers who have provided arguments against the existence of God include Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Friedrich Nietzsche and Bertrand Russell. In modern culture, the question of God's existence has been discussed by scientists such as Stephen Hawking, Francis Collins, Lawrence M. Krauss, Richard Dawkins, Carl Sagan, Neil deGrasse Tyson, John Lennox and Sam Harris, as well as philosophers including Richard Swinburne, Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig, Rebecca Goldstein, A. C. Grayling, Daniel Dennett, Edward Feser and David Bentley Hart.\n\nScientists follow the scientific method, within which theories must be verifiable by physical experiment. The majority of prominent conceptions of God explicitly or effectively posit a being which is not testable either by proof or disproof. On these bases, the question regarding the existence of God, one for which evidence cannot be tested, may lie outside the purview of modern science by definition. The Catholic Church maintains that knowledge of the existence of God is the \"natural light of human reason\". Fideists maintain that belief in the existence of God may not be amenable to demonstration or refutation, but rests on faith alone.\n\nAtheists view arguments for the existence of God as insufficient, mistaken or weighing less in comparison to arguments against whereas some religions, such as Buddhism, are not concerned with the existence of gods at all and yet other religions, such as Jainism, reject the possibility of a creator deity.\n\nPositions on the existence of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief (or lack of it), while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions of knowledge (or the lack of it). Ignosticism concerns belief regarding God's conceptual coherence. Apatheism concerns belief regarding the practical importance of whether God exists.\n\nFor the purposes of discussion, Richard Dawkins described seven \"milestones\" on his spectrum of theistic probability:\n\n\nThe Catholic Church, following the teachings of Paul the Apostle, Thomas Aquinas, and the First Vatican Council, affirms that God's existence \"can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason\".\n\nIn classical theism, God is characterized as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is devoid of any anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists do not believe that God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.\n\nIn modern Western societies, the concepts of God typically entail a monotheistic, supreme, ultimate, and personal being, as found in the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions. In monotheistic religions outside the Abrahamic traditions, the existence of God is discussed in similar terms. In these traditions, God is also identified as the author (either directly or by inspiration) of certain texts, or that certain texts describe specific historical events caused by the God in question or communications from God (whether in direct speech or via dreams or omens). Some traditions also believe that God is the entity which is currently answering prayers for intervention or information or opinions.\n\nMany Islamic scholars have used philosophical and rational arguments to prove the existence of God. For example, Ibn Rushd, a 12th-century Islamic scholar, philosopher, and physician, states there are only two arguments worthy of adherence, both of which are found in what he calls the \"Precious Book\" (The Qur'an). Rushd cites “providence” and “invention” in using the Qur'an's parables to claim the existence of God. Rushd argues that the Earth's weather patterns are conditioned to support human life; thus, if the planet is so finely-tuned to maintain life, then it suggests a fine tuner - God. The Sun and the Moon are not just random objects floating in the Milky Way, rather they serve us day and night, and the way nature works and how life is formed, humankind benefits from it. Rushd essentially comes to a conclusion that there has to be a higher being who has made everything perfectly to serve the needs of human beings.\n\nMoses ben Maimon, widely known as Maimonides, was a Jewish scholar who tried to logically prove the existence of God. Maimonides offered proofs for the existence of God, but he did not begin with defining God first, like many others do. Rather, he used the description of the earth and the universe to prove the existence of God. He talked about the Heavenly bodies and how they are committed to eternal motion. Maimonides argued that because every physical object is finite, it can only contain a finite amount of power. If everything in the universe, which includes all the planets and the stars, is finite, then there has to be an infinite power to push forth the motion of everything in the universe. Narrowing down to an infinite being, the only thing that can explain the motion is an infinite being (meaning God) which is neither a body nor a force in the body. Maimonides believed that this argument gives us a ground to believe that God is, not an idea of what God is. He believed that God cannot be understood or be compared.\n\nIn pantheism, God and the universe are considered to be the same thing. In this view, the natural sciences are essentially studying the nature of God. This definition of God creates the philosophical problem that a universe with God and one without God are the same, other than the words used to describe it.\n\nDeism and panentheism assert that there is a God distinct from, or which extends beyond (either in time or in space or in some other way) the universe. These positions deny that God intervenes in the operation of the universe, including communicating with humans personally. The notion that God never intervenes or communicates with the universe, or may have evolved into the universe, makes it difficult, if not by definition impossible, to distinguish between a universe with God and one without.\n\nIn Christian faith, theologians and philosophers make a distinction between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.\n\nThe argument that the existence of God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. St. Paul made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because \"since the creation of the world God's invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made\". In this Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by St. Thomas and others, but that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.\n\nAnother apologetical school of thought, including Dutch and American Reformed thinkers (such as Abraham Kuyper, Benjamin Warfield, Herman Dooyeweerd), emerged in the late 1920s. This school was instituted by Cornelius Van Til, and came to be popularly called presuppositional apologetics (though Van Til himself felt \"transcendental\" would be a more accurate title). The main distinction between this approach and the more classical evidentialist approach is that the presuppositionalist denies any common ground between the believer and the non-believer, except that which the non-believer denies, namely, the assumption of the truth of the theistic worldview. In other words, presuppositionalists do not believe that the existence of God can be proven by appeal to raw, uninterpreted, or \"brute\" facts, which have the same (theoretical) meaning to people with fundamentally different worldviews, because they deny that such a condition is even possible. They claim that the only possible proof for the existence of God is that the very same belief is the necessary condition to the intelligibility of all other human experience and action. They attempt to prove the existence of God by means of appeal to the transcendental necessity of the belief—indirectly (by appeal to the unavowed presuppositions of the non-believer's worldview) rather than directly (by appeal to some form of common factuality). In practice this school utilizes what have come to be known as transcendental arguments. In these arguments they claim to demonstrate that all human experience and action (even the condition of unbelief, itself) is a proof for the existence of God, because God's existence is the necessary condition of their intelligibility.\n\nAlvin Plantinga presents an argument for the existence of God using modal logic. Others have said that the logical and philosophical arguments for and against the existence of God miss the point. The word \"God\" has a meaning in human culture and history that does not correspond to the beings whose existence is supported by such arguments, assuming they are valid. The real question is not whether a \"most perfect being\" or an \"uncaused first cause\" exist. The real question is whether Jehovah, Zeus, Ra, Krishna, or any gods of any religion exist, and if so, which gods? On the other hand, many theists equate all monotheistic or henotheistic \"most perfect Beings\", no matter what name is assigned to them/him, as the one monotheistic God (one example would be understanding the Muslim Allah, Christian Yhwh, and Chinese Shangdi as different names for the same Being). Most of these arguments do not resolve the issue of which of these figures is more likely to exist. These arguments fail to make the distinction between immanent gods and a Transcendent God.\n\nSome Christians note that the Christian faith teaches \"salvation is by faith\", and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God's existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In \"The Justification of Knowledge\", the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond's position is similar to that of his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a \"leap of faith\". This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.\n\nThe atheistic conclusion is that the arguments and evidence both indicate there is insufficient reason to believe that any gods exist, and that personal subjective religious experiences say something about the human experience rather than the nature of reality itself; therefore, one has no reason to believe that a god exists.\n\nPositive atheism (also called \"strong atheism\" and \"hard atheism\") is a form of atheism that asserts that no deities exist. The strong atheist explicitly asserts the non-existence of gods. Some strong atheists further assert that the existence of gods is logically impossible, stating that the combination of attributes which God may be asserted to have (omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, transcendence, omnibenevolence) are logically contradictory, incomprehensible, or absurd, and therefore the existence of such a god is \"a priori\" false. Metaphysical naturalism is a common worldview associated with strong atheism.\n\nNegative atheism (also called \"weak atheism\" and \"soft atheism\") is any type of atheism other than positive, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deities, but does not explicitly assert there to be none.\n\nAgnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism as a broad umbrella term does not define one's belief or disbelief in gods; agnostics may still identify themselves as theists or atheists.\n\nStrong agnosticism is the belief that it is impossible for humans to know whether or not any deities exist.\n\nWeak agnosticism is the belief that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown but not necessarily unknowable.\n\nAgnostic theism is the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or God, but regards the basis of this proposition as \"unknown or inherently unknowable\". Agnostic theists may also insist on ignorance regarding the properties of the gods they believe in.\n\nAgnostic atheism is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a deity is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.\n\nThe theologian Robert Flint explains:\n\nAn apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or denying any claims that gods exist or do not exist. An apatheist lives as if there are no gods and explains natural phenomena without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.\n\nThe ignostic (or igtheist) usually concludes that the question of God's existence or nonexistence is usually not worth discussing because concepts like \"God\" are usually not sufficiently clearly defined. Ignosticism or igtheism is the theological position that every other theological position (including agnosticism and atheism) assumes too much about the concept of God and many other theological concepts. It can be defined as encompassing two related views about the existence of God. The view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is unfalsifiable, the ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless. In this case, the concept of God is not considered meaningless; the term \"God\" is considered meaningless. The second view is synonymous with theological noncognitivism, and skips the step of first asking \"What is meant by 'God'?\" before proclaiming the original question \"Does God exist?\" as meaningless.\n\nSome philosophers have seen ignosticism as a variation of agnosticism or atheism, while others have considered it to be distinct. An ignostic maintains that he cannot even say whether he is a theist or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.\n\nThe term \"ignosticism\" was coined in the 1960s by Sherwin Wine, a rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism. The term \"igtheism\" was coined by the secular humanist Paul Kurtz in his 1992 book \"The New Skepticism\".\n\nOne problem posed by the question of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various supernatural powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of Baucis and Philemon. In addition, according to concepts of God, God is not part of the natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in Aristotelian philosophy, God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of the natural order that is derived from God's place as originator of nature (see also Monadology).\n\nIn Karl Popper's philosophy of science, belief in a supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable in the natural world. The non-overlapping magisteria view proposed by Stephen Jay Gould also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God is irrelevant to and beyond the domain of science.\n\nLogical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed any talk of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences can not have a truth value, and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it \"Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic.\" This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the unprovable.\n\nJohn Polkinghorne suggests that the nearest analogy to the existence of God in physics is the ideas of quantum mechanics which are seemingly paradoxical but make sense of a great deal of disparate data.\n\nAlvin Plantinga compares the question of the existence of God to the question of the existence of other minds, claiming both are notoriously impossible to \"prove\" against a determined skeptic.\n\nOne approach, suggested by writers such as Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism as though they were two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously suggested by proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.\n\nPhilosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a view that is considered anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God's existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.\n\nIn George Berkeley's \"A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge\" of 1710, he argued that a \"naked thought\" cannot exist, and that a perception is a thought; therefore only minds can be proven to exist, since all else is merely an idea conveyed by a perception. From this Berkeley argued that the universe is based upon observation and is non-objective. However, he noted that the universe includes \"ideas\" not perceptible to humankind, and that there must, therefore, exist an omniscient superobserver, which perceives such things. Berkeley considered this proof of the existence of the Christian god.\n\nC.S. Lewis, in \"Mere Christianity\" and elsewhere, raised the argument from desire. He posed that all natural desires have a natural object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies the existence of such things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.\n\nExistence in absolute truth is central to Vedanta epistemology. Traditional sense perception based approaches were put into question as possibly misleading due to preconceived or superimposed ideas. But though all object-cognition can be doubted, the existence of the doubter remains a fact even in \"nastika\" traditions of \"mayavada\" schools following Adi Shankara. The five eternal principles to be discussed under ontology, beginning with God or Isvara, the Ultimate Reality cannot be established by the means of logic alone, and often require superior proof.\nIn Vaisnavism Vishnu, or his intimate ontological form of Krishna, is equated to personal absolute God of the Western traditions. Aspects of Krishna as \"svayam bhagavan\" in original Absolute Truth, \"sat chit ananda\", are understood originating from three essential attributes of Krishna's form, i.e., \"eternal existence\" or \"\", related to the \"brahman\" aspect; \"knowledge\" or chit, to the \"paramatman\"; and \"bliss\" or \"ananda\" in Sanskrit, to \"bhagavan\".\n\nOne form of the argument from beauty is that the elegance of the laws of physics, which have been empirically discovered, or the elegant laws of mathematics, which are abstract but which have empirically proven to be useful, is evidence of a creator deity who has arranged these things to be beautiful and not ugly.\n\nThe argument from consciousness claims that human consciousness cannot be explained by the physical mechanisms of the human body and brain, therefore, asserting that there must be non-physical aspects to human consciousness. This is held as indirect evidence of God, given that notions about souls and the afterlife in Christianity and Islam would be consistent with such a claim. Critics point out that non-physical aspects of consciousness could exist in a universe without any gods; for example, some religions that believe in reincarnation are compatible with atheism, monotheism, and polytheism.\n\nThe notion of the soul was created before modern understanding of neural networks and the physiology of the brain. Decades of experimentation lead cognitive science to consider thought and emotion as physical processes although the experience of consciousness still remains poorly understood. The hard problem of consciousness remains as to whether different people subjectively experience the world in the same way — for example, that the color blue looks the same inside the minds of different people, though this is a philosophical problem with both physical and non-physical explanations.\n\nIn article 3, question 2, first part of his \"Summa Theologica\", Thomas Aquinas developed his five arguments for God's existence. These arguments are grounded in an Aristotelian ontology and make use of the infinite regression argument. Aquinas did not intend to fully prove the existence of God as he is orthodoxly conceived (with all of his traditional attributes), but proposed his Five Ways as a first stage, which he built upon later in his work. Aquinas' Five Ways argued from the unmoved mover, first cause, necessary being, argument from degree, and the teleological argument.\n\n\nPhilosopher Georg Hegel signed a publishing contract in 1831 for his final book, \"Lectures on the Proofs of the Existence of God\" (1831). Sadly, Hegel died that year, before completing his first draft of that work. What we know about this planned work we find in the pages of his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion\" (1818-1831). There we find that Hegel proposed a dialectical reworking of the three classical proofs of the existence of God, namely: (1) the cosmological argument; (2) the teleological argument; and (3) the ontological argument. Hegel recognized that Immanuel Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\" had sharply criticized the three classical proofs, and as a veteran critic of Kantian epistemology, Hegel chose to show where Kant, Schleiermacher and Jacobi had been mistaken in their negative positions over the three classical proofs. Thus, Hegel went about reworking these classical arguments by using his own dialectical logic.\n\nPhilosopher Stephen Toulmin is notable for his work in the history of ideas that features the (rational) warrant: a statement that connects the premises to a conclusion.\n\nJoseph Hinman applied Toulmin's approach in his argument for the existence of God, particularly in his book \"The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief\". Instead of attempting to prove the existence of God, Hinman argues you can \"demonstrate the rationally-warranted nature of belief\".\n\nHinman uses a wide range of studies, including ones by Robert Wuthnow, Andrew Greeley, Mathes and Kathleen Nobel to establish that mystical experiences are life-transformative in a way that is significant, positive and lasting. He draws on additional work to add several additional major points to his argument. First, the people who have these experiences not only do not exhibit traditional signs of mental illness but, often, are in better mental and physical health than the general population due to the experience. Second, the experiences work. In other words, they provide a framework for navigating life that is useful and effective. All of the evidence of the positive effects of the experience upon people's lives he, adapting a term from Derrida, terms \"the trace of God\": the footprints left behind that point to the impact.\n\nFinally, he discusses how both religious experience and belief in God is, and has always been, normative among humans: people do not need to prove the existence of God. If there is no need to prove, Hinman argues, and the Trace of God (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.\n\nThe ontological argument has been formulated by philosophers including St. Anselm and René Descartes. The argument proposes that God's existence is self-evident. The logic, depending on the formulation, reads roughly as follows:\nThomas Aquinas criticized the argument for proposing a definition of God which, if God is transcendent, should be impossible for humans. Immanuel Kant criticized the proof from a logical standpoint: he stated that the term \"God\" really signifies two different terms: both idea of God, and God. Kant concluded that the proof is equivocation, based on the ambiguity of the word God. Kant also challenged the argument's assumption that existence is a predicate (of perfection) because it does not add anything to the essence of a being. If existence is not a predicate, then it is not necessarily true that the greatest possible being exists. A common rebuttal to Kant's critique is that, although \"existence\" does add something to both the concept and the reality of God, the concept would be vastly different if its referent is an unreal Being. Another response to Kant is attributed to Alvin Plantinga who explains that even if one were to grant Kant that \"existence\" is not a real predicate, \"Necessary Existence\", which is the correct formulation of an understanding of God, is a real predicate, thus according to Plantinga Kant's argument is refuted.\n\nInductive arguments argue their conclusions through inductive reasoning.\n\n\n\nArguments from testimony rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the propositions of a specific revealed religion. Swinburne argues that it is a principle of rationality that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing so.\n\n\nThe school of Vedanta argues that one of the proofs of the existence of God is the law of karma. In a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), Adi Sankara argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara). The Nyaya school make similar arguments.\n\nEach of the arguments below aims to show that a particular set of gods does not exist—by demonstrating them to be inherently meaningless, contradictory, or at odds with known scientific or historical facts—or that there is insufficient proof to say that they do exist.\n\nThe following empirical arguments rely on observations or experimentation to yield their conclusions.\n\nThe following arguments deduce, mostly through self-contradiction, the existence of a God as \"the Creator\". \nSome arguments focus on the existence of specific conceptions of God as being omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect.\n\nInductive arguments argue their conclusions through inductive reasoning.\n\nSimilar to the arguments for the existence of God, subjective arguments against the supernatural mainly rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, or the propositions of a revealed religion in general.\n\n\nAtheistic Hindu doctrines cite various arguments for rejecting a creator God or \"Ishvara\". The \"\" of the Samkhya school states that there is no philosophical place for a creator God in this system. It is also argued in this text that the existence of Ishvara (God) cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. For instance, it argues that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world. It says God is a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances. The Sutras of Samkhya endeavor to prove that the idea of God is inconceivable and self-contradictory, and some commentaries speak plainly on this subject. The \"Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi\", commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world, and if God's motive is kindness, Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering. Samkhya postulates that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not an imperfect world like the real world.\n\nCharvaka, originally known as Lokāyata, a heterodox Hindu philosophy states that there is \"no God, no samsara (rebirth), no karma, no duty, no fruits of merit, no sin.\" Proponents of the school of Mimamsa, which is based on rituals and orthopraxy, decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God is insufficient. They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals. Mimamsa argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the \"mantras\" that speak their names. In that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.\n\nSeveral authors have offered psychological or sociological explanations for belief in the existence of God.\n\nPsychologists observe that the majority of humans often ask existential questions such as \"why we are here\" and whether life has purpose. Some psychologists have posited that religious beliefs may recruit cognitive mechanisms in order to satisfy these questions. William James emphasized the inner religious struggle between melancholy and happiness, and pointed to trance as a cognitive mechanism. Sigmund Freud stressed fear and pain, the need for a powerful parental figure, the obsessional nature of ritual, and the hypnotic state a community can induce as contributing factors to the psychology of religion.\n\nPascal Boyer's \"Religion Explained\" (2002), based in part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God as the result of the brain's tendency towards agency detection. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans err on the side of attributing agency where there isn't any. In Boyer's view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of \"minimally counterintuitive\" beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.\n\nScott Atran's \"In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion\" (2002) makes a similar argument and adds examination of the socially coordinating aspects of shared belief. In \"Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion\", Todd Tremlin follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces the concept of the supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a theory of mind module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events for which there is no obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. Act of God).\n\n\n"}

It surveys the effects of industrial livestock production and industrial fish farming around the world. The book is the result of Lymbery's investigations for which he travelled the world over three years. Isabel Oakeshott is the political editor of \"The Sunday Times\", Philip Lymbery is CEO of Compassion in World Farming. The book was published by Bloomsbury.\n\nThe thesis examined in the book is that globalised production chains of industrialised agricultural systems negatively affect farmed animals, human health, the countryside, rivers and oceans, biodiversity in rainforests and many of the world's poorest people. The authors seek to shed light on the conditions in intensive agriculture which, according to them, often differ from the image that the industry wants to sell to the public. Intensification in animal farming goes along with a growing demand of cropland to grow animal feed – factory farming is thus not a means to save space. They argue consequently that to feed the world population factory farming is not the solution but a threat, not least since more than a third of the world's arable harvests are being used to supply farmed animals. According to the book the consumer price of cheap meat does not include the overall costs of industrial meat production.\n\nThe reader follows Lymbery's journey from his start in California's Central Valley. There he finds dairies where 10,000 cows can be milked at once. He travels to enormous piggeries in China and visits the fishmeal industry of Peru, which converts millions of tonnes of anchovies to fishmeal for supplying the livestock industry with feed. In Taiwan he visits a farm (labelled \"organic\") where 300,000 laying hens are being starved and held in batteries. A visit is paid to the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, US where he finds the marine ecosystem impacted by waste from the poultry industry. The author talks to a community in Mexico in an area dominated by pig sheds. There he documents a lake of effluent and air and water pollution, and discusses the outbreak of swine flu. \n\nOne chapter of \"Farmageddon\" is dedicated to the question \"What happened to the vet?\" Lymbery says that veterinarians work in an industry with an \"inbuild flaw\". He states that veterinarians often comply with the industrialization of animals, for example in the prophylactic use of antibiotics which are applied in the mass production of animals, eggs and milk instead of demanding a different (pasture-based) agricultural system. According to Lymbery veterinarians should not support systems that are \"inherently bad for animal welfare\", which allegedly is the case in \"mass production of broiler chickens, caged production of eggs, the large-scale permanent housing of dairy cows (so-called mega dairies) and highly intensive pig production where mothering pigs are kept in confinement where they can't turn around for weeks at a time\".\n\nIn order to prevent \"Farmageddon\" the authors come up with suggestions for consumers, policy makers and farmers: Consumers should eat less meat. Fish should be fed to people rather than converted into fishmeal. Animals should be fed with grass and animal farming should be a pasture-based system. These changes would save resources by reducing the competition of humans and animals for food and land.\n\nTristram Stuart wrote in a review for \"The Guardian\" that although he is critical towards the \"orthodoxy that large-scale farms and industrial agricultural technology are inherently wrong\", \"this catalogue of devastation will convince anyone who doubts that industrial farming is causing ecological meltdown\". \n\n"}

Athanase bought the manuscripts in Cyprus, Constantinople, Mount Athos, and in other territories bordering the northern and western Aegean.\n\nThe collection contains almost 400 manuscripts. Athanase collected more than 300 manuscripts (probably 358) personally. After Séguier's death, all this collection was inherited by his grandson, Henri-Charles de Coislin (1664–1732), bishop of Metz. He gave it to the Benedictine monks of Saint-Germain-des-Prés in Paris.\nThe first catalogue of this collection, the Coislin catalogue, was made in 1715, in which 42 manuscripts were described (Bernard de Montfaucon, \"Bibliotheca Coisliniana olim Segueriana\", Paris: Ludovicus Guerin & Carolus Robustel, 1715). A large part of the collection was burned in 1793, and in 1795 \"Fonds Coislin\" was deposited in the National Library of France, where it has been held until the present day. A few manuscripts, bought by Russians in time of Catherine II, now are held at Saint Petersburg, (s.v. Dubrowski).\n\nOne of the best known manuscripts of the collection is the fragmentary uncial Codex Coislinianus.

The FreeOTFE website is unreachable as of June 2013 and the domain name is now registered by a domain squatter. The original program can be downloaded from a mirror at Sourceforge. In June 2014, a fork of the project now named LibreCrypt appeared on GitHub.\n\n\"FreeOTFE\" was initially released by Sarah Dean in 2004, and was the first open source code disk encryption system that provided a modular architecture allowing 3rd parties to implement additional algorithms if needed. Older FreeOTFE licensing required that any modification to the program be placed in the public domain. This does not conform technically to section 3 of the Open Source definition. Newer program licensing omits this condition. The FreeOTFE license has not been approved by the Open Source Initiative and is not certified to be labeled with the open-source certification mark.\n\nThis software is compatible with Linux encrypted volumes (e.g. LUKS, cryptoloop, dm-crypt), allowing data encrypted under Linux to be read (and written) freely. It was the first open source transparent disk encryption system to support Windows Vista and PDAs.\n\nOptional two-factor authentication using smart cards and/or hardware security modules (HSMs, also termed security tokens) was introduced in v4.0, using the PKCS#11 (Cryptoki) standard developed by RSA Laboratories.\n\n\"FreeOTFE\" also allows any number of \"hidden volumes\" to be created, giving plausible deniability and deniable encryption, and also has the option of encrypting full partitions or disks (but not the system partition).\n\nFreeOTFE can be used in \"portable\" (or \"traveller\") mode, which allows it to be kept on a USB drive or other portable media, together with its encrypted data, and carried around. This allows it to be used under Microsoft Windows without installation of the complete program to \"mount\" and access the encrypted data through a virtual disk.\n\nThe use of this mode requires installing device drivers (at least temporarily) to create virtual disks, and as a consequence administrator rights are needed to start this traveller mode. As with most open source software that uses device drivers, the user must enable test signing when running Windows Vista x64 and Windows 7 x64 systems.\n\nPackaged with FreeOTFE is another program called \"FreeOTFE Explorer\", which provides a \"driverless system\" that allows encrypted disks to be used without administrator rights.\n\nThis allows FreeOTFE encrypted data to be used on (for example) public computers found in libraries or computer kiosks (interactive kiosks), where administrator rights are unavailable.\n\nUnlike FreeOTFE, FreeOTFE Explorer does not provide on-the-fly encryption through a virtual drive.

His father, George Myles Davie was a pharmacist and chemistry teacher, and his mother was Isabella Calder Elder. He married Elspeth Mary Dryer, an art teacher, on 5 October 1944 at Bonnyrigg Church in Midlothian. Elspeth Davie later became a respected writer and was awarded the Katherine Mansfield Prize in 1978. They had one daughter with whom he resided at Sutton Veny, Wiltshire at the time of his death on 20 March 2007.\n\n\n\nIn this book, Davie deals with the struggle during the 19th century in Scotland to maintain a generalist form of education which is not only philosophical but also scientific, humanistic and democratic. The book has been described as \"a thesis about liberal education – pursued by a micro-historical investigation of the culture and academic politics of Scotland's universities in the 19th century. More than 40 years on, the book's discussions of the restriction of academic independence by centralisation, inter-university competition for prestige, research versus teaching and even versus scholarship, notions of abandoning moral discourse for ill-examined claims regarding scientific advance, are still relevant.\" \nDavie's somewhat prolix style of writing is exemplified here:\n“It is possible to confirm still further the importance which this ideal of a philosophical education had for the Scots if we turn from the achieved pattern of national pedagogy to the plans which were being mooted for its development. What these plans reveal – until well on in the nineteenth century – is the remarkable hold on the country of the belief in the possibility of general education through philosophy. Not that the Scots had any dislike of professional accomplishment; on the contrary, they admired it even to excess, and were eager for the introduction into their educational system of training centres for higher education and specialisation in the new subjects. But the distinctive mark of their thinking about these matters and of the organised projects it inspired was that they wanted to retain philosophy as a compulsory part of what we would now call secondary education (fifteen to nineteen), and that admission to the specialist schools – though it was to be granted early – nevertheless would require, as a preliminary, philosophical education in the old style.”\n\n\n"}

He is now known for his writings on political theory.\n\nHe was born in Schlanstedt, a village in the present-day Harz district of Germany, near Huy. He studied philosophy and medicine at the Protestant University of Helmstedt from 1589. After travels in England and France, he became court physician to Christian IV of Denmark.\n\nAt Helmstedt, Arnisaeus became a pupil of Cornelius Martini, a Lutheran metaphysician who also influenced Hermann Conring. He used an Aristotelian analysis to distinguish in political thought between the \"civitas\" and the \"res publica\", in a critique of Jean Bodin, Johannes Althusius, Busius (Paulus Buis or Buys, died 1617), and Bartholomäus Keckermann. He particularly criticized Bodin's strictures on mixed government in his 1606 \"Doctrina politica\". That work also incorporated Tacitean ideas, under the influence of Arnold Clapmar, within the Aristotelian and humanist framework he proposed, attacking the Ramist critics of Aristotle.\n\nWhile Arnisaeus saw a role for civil society, he did not admit any qualification of the power of the 'magistrate'. In 1610 in \"De jure majestatis\" he took Bodin's part against the mixed state; even so, in relation to Holy Roman Empire and its institutions he admitted that sovereignty could in practical terms be distributed among several authorities. He is therefore classed as an 'absolutist', a supporter of absolute monarchy. Theoretically, in the case of the Empire, he argued that sovereignty lay with the Prince-electors. This was very much a minority view among Germans, opposed by Althusius and Keckermann, as well as Hermann Kirchner, Daniel Otto, and Tobias Paurmeister, all of whom took the view that the Emperor was a true monarch.\n\nAgainst Althusius, he argued that (true) monarchy could be compromised by concessions of power that distorted the 'form' of the state, and that this was a more accurate description of the actual French state.\n\nArnisaeus died in Copenhagen.\n\nHis ideas were influential in the setting up of Danish absolutism.\n\n\n"}

He is noted as being the first Bengali leader of Pakistan who led the country as Prime Minister (1951–53), as well as the second Governor-General (1948–51).\n\nBorn into an aristocrat \"Nawab\" family in Bengal in 1894, he was educated at the Aligarh Muslim University before pursuing his education at the Cambridge University to secure his graduation. Upon returning, he started his political career on a Muslim League platform where he primary focused on education causes in Bengal before leading the cause for separate Muslim homeland, Pakistan, under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. From 1943–45, he served as the Prime Minister of Bengal and later becoming the Chief Minister in 1947 until 1948 when he ascended as Governor-General after Jinnah's passing.\n\nIn 1951, he took over the control of the government as Prime Minister of Pakistan upon the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan, and relinquished the post of Governor-General to Sir Malik Ghulam. As Prime Minister, he struggled to run the government effectively on the internal and foreign fronts, and thus he tenured for only two years. On the home front, he struggled to maintain law and order in the country and instructed the military to impose martial law in Lahore due to religious riots and stagnation. He also faced a populist language movement in his native Bengal that eventually led to the shutdown of Government of East Pakistan. Foreign relations with the United States, Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and India soured as republicanism and socialism gained popularity at home.\n\nEventually, he was forced to step down in favor of diplomat Mohammad Ali Bogra by his own appointed Governor-General Sir Malik Ghulam and conceded defeat in elections held in 1954. Upon retiring from national politics, he suffered a brief illness and died in 1964. He was buried at a Mausoleum in Dhaka.\n\nNazimuddin was born into an aristocratic and wealthy family of the Nawabs of Dhaka, Dacca, Bengal, on 19 July 1894. He was the maternal grandson of Nawab Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah and his mother, Bilquis Bano, was notable for her own statue. Nazimuddin had a younger brother, Khwaja Shahabuddin, who would later played a vital role in national politics onwards. Being of Kashmiri-Bengali descent, his family spoke both Urdu and Bengali. They were the first cousin of Nawab Khwaja Habibullah son of Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur who helped laid foundation of Muslim League in 1906.\n\nHe was educated at the Dunstable Grammar School in England but returned to India following his matriculation where he enrolled to attend the MAO College of the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in Uttar Pradesh, India. Nazimuddin secured his graduation with a BA degree in Sociology from AMU and was sent back to England to pursue higher education. During his time at AMU, he was known to be an avid Tennis player and excelled in this sport when he represented his university in collegiate games.\n\nAfter AMU, Nazimuddin went to England and attended Trinity College at Cambridge University. He was granted his MA degree in English by Cambridge University. His training in England enabled him to practice law and become a Barrister-at-Law in England.\nHe was knighted in 1934. In 1947–49, Nazimuddin was granted the degree of Doctor of Laws by the Vice-Chancellor of Dhaka University, Dr. Mahmud Hasan.\n\nNazimuddin returned to India to join his brother Khwaja Shahbuddin from England, taking interest in civil and public affairs that led him to join the Bengali politics. Both brother joined the Muslim League, and Nazimuddin successfully ran for the municipality election and elected as Chairman of Dhaka Municipality from 1922 until 1929. During this time, he was appointed as Education minister and later secured a political appointment in Viceroy's Executive Council in 1934 which he served until 1937.\n\nHe participated in regional elections held on 1937 on a Muslim League's platform but conceded his defeat in favor of Fazlul Haq of Krishak Praja Part (KPP) who was appointed as Prime Minister of Bengal, while assuming his personal role as member of the legislative assembly.\n\nIn the India Office Records, Political and Secret Department Records (1756–1950), Category L/P&S, Record 5/250, 3/79, one comes across the Fortnightly Report (February 1947) to the Viceroy by the then Governor of Punjab Sir Evan Jenkins. According to this report when inquired about the Pakistan project, Khawaja Nazimuddin candidly told him that ″he did not know what Pakistan means and that nobody in the Muslim League knew.″ This remark clearly shows that so few as six months before the creation of Pakistan, even senior Muslim League leaders had no clarity as to the basic features of the State they were asking for.\n\nUpon the formation of the coalition government in an agreement facilitated between Muslim League and the Krishak Praja Party, Nazimuddin was appointed as the home minister under Haq's premiership., which he continued until 1943.\n\nDue to his conservative elite position, he became close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, then-President of Muslim League, who appointed him as a member of the executive committee to successfully promote Muslim League' party agenda and program that gained popularity in East Bengal. In 1940–41, Nazimuddin broke away from the coalition led by Premier Fazlul Haq and decided to become a leader of the opposition, leading campaign against Haq's premiership and primarily focused on Bengali nationalism issues. In 1943, Nazimuddin took over the government from Premier Haq when the latter was dismissed by the Governor John Herbert amid controversies surrounding in his political campaigns. During this time, Nazimuddin played a crucial political role for the cause for the separate Muslim homeland, Pakistan. About his role, he was asked about the \"Pakistan question\" by British Governor Richard Casey in 1945 but he showed very little and no interests in discussing the existence of the movement and reportedly quoting: he did not know what Pakistan means and nobody in Muslim League knew.\"\n\nHis premiership lasted until 1945 when a motion of no confidence and faced with defeat in the assembly hall by 160 to 97 votes that effectively ended his premiership. He relinquished the office to Nausher Ali, an Indian nationalist Muslim and a prominent member of Congress Party who the speaker of the assembly, but the administration was taken over by Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy.\n\nFrom 1945–47, Sir Nazimuddin continued to be served as the chairman of the Muslim League in Bengal, ardently supporting the political cause for Pakistan against the Congress Party. During this time, he had been in brief conflict with Premier Suhrawardy and strongly opposed the United Bengal Movement and led a strong parliamentary opposition in the assembly against Suhrawardy's administration in April 1947. The conflict between two men mainly existed because Suhrawardy had represented the middle class while Nazimuddin was representing the aristocracy in the assembly.\n\nIn 1947, he again contested in the party elections in the Muslim League against Suhrawardy's platform and securing his nomination as the party chairman for the Muslim League's East Bengal chapter. His success in the party election eventually led him to the appointed as the first Chief Minister of East Bengal after the partition of India in 1947 and effectively gained controlled of the Muslim League in the province.\n\nAs the Chief Minister, he led the motion of confidence that ultimately voted in favor of joining the federation of Pakistan and reorganized the Government of East Pakistan by delegating conservative members in his administration.\n\nOn 14 August of 1947, Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah relinquished the party presidency of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) to Khawaja Nazimuddin who took over the party of President of Pakistan Muslim League (PML), due to his party electoral performance. On 1 November 1947, he was appointed as acting Governor-General in the absence of Governor-General Jinnah due to worsening health, and eventually appointed as Governor-General after passing of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in a crucial support provided by Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan on 14 September 1948 to the President Nazimuddin. His oath of office was supervised by Chief Justice Sir Abdul Rashid of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, in attendance with Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan.\n\nAs Governor-General, Nazimuddin set a precedent of neutrality and non-interference in the government, and provided his political support to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan's government, which was seen as essential to the working of the responsible government at that time.\n\nHis role as Governor-General reflected a conservative mind-set and he spoke against secularism in the country.\n\nIn 1949, Governor-General Nazimuddin established the parliamentary committee, the Basic Principles Committee, on the advice of Prime Minister Ali Khan to underlying basic principles that would lay foundation of Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1950, Nazimuddin released an official policy statement and declared that: \"Pakistan would remain incomplete until the whole of Kashmir is liberated.\"\n\nAfter the assassination of Liaqat Ali Khan in 1951, the Muslim League leaders asked Governor-General Nazimuddin to take over the business of the government as well as the party's presidency as there was no other person found suitable for the post. He appointed Finance Minister Sir Malik Ghulam as Governor-General's post. Nazimuddin's government focused towards promoting the political programs aimed towards conservative ideas. During his time in office, a framework was begun for a constitution that would allow Pakistan to become a republic, and end its Dominion status under the English monarchy.\n\nNazimuddin's administration took place during a poor economy and the rise of provincial nationalism in four provinces and East Bengal which made him unable to run the country's affairs effectively. By 1951–52, the Muslim League had split into two different factions dominated by the Bengali chapter and Punjab-Sindh chapter, as those were the two largest ethnic demographics, but were separated by India.\n\nIn 1951, Prime Minister Nazimuddin's government conducted the country's first nationwide census where it was noted that 57% population of the country was Indian immigrants, mostly residing in Karachi that further complicated the situation in the country.\nIn January 1952, Prime Minister Nazimuddin publicly announced in Dacca's meeting that: Jinnah had been right: for the sake of Pakistan's national unity, Urdu must be the official language of Pakistan–East and West. On 21 February 1952, a demonstration in the Bengali Language movement demanding equal and official status to the Bengali language turned bloody, with many fatalities caused by police firings. This demonstration was held when he declared Urdu the National Language of Pakistan, following the previous statement of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that Urdu shall be 'one and only' language of Pakistan.\n\nIn 1953, a violent religious movement led by far-right Jamaat-e-Islami began to agitate for the removal of the Ahmadi religious minority from power positions, and demanded a declaration of this minority as non-Muslims.\n\nNazimuddin was held morally responsible for riots being spread and resisted such pressures; but mass rioting broke out in Punjab against both the government and followers of this religious minority. Prime Minister Nazimuddin responded to the violence by dismissing the Chief Minister of Punjab, Mumtaz Daultana, to Feroz Khan Noon, but the decision came late. He declared martial law and enforced through Lieutenant General Azam Khan who successfully quelled the agitation.\n\nThe agitations and violence spread through the successful Bengali language movement and the riots in Lahore proved the inability of Prime Minister Nazimuddin's government as he was widely seen as weak in running the government administration.\n\nIn a view of attempting to improve the economy and internal security, Governor-General Malik Ghulam asked Prime Minister Nazimuddin to step down in the wider interest of the country. Prime Minister Nazimuddin refused to oblige and Governor-General Malik Ghulam used reserve powers granted in the Government of India Act, 1935, dismissed Prime Minister Nazimuddin.\n\nNazimuddin then requested the Supreme Court of Pakistan's intervention against this action but the Chief Justice, Moh'd Munir did not rule on the legality of the dismissal, but instead forced new elections to be held in 1954. Governor-General Malik Ghulam appointed another Bengali politician, Muhammad Ali Bogra who was then tenuring as the Pakistan ambassador to the United States, as the new Prime Minister until the new elections to be held in 1954. The dismissal of Sir Khawaja Nazimuddin's administration, the Prime Minister, by the Governor-General Malik Ghulam, signalled a troubling trend in political history of the country.\n\nEven after his dismissal, he and his family remained active in parliamentary politics; his nephew, Khwaja Wasiuddin, an army general serving as GOC-in-C II Corps and later repatriated to Bangladesh in 1974.\n\nHis younger brother, Shahabuddin, remained active in the politics and eventually ascended as Information minister in the President Ayub Khan's administration. \nSir Khawaja died in 1964, aged 70. He was buried at Mausoleum of three leaders in his hometown of Dhaka..He is considered a betrayer by Bengalis as he called the language movement protesters Communists.\n\nNazimuddin and his brother, Shahabuddin, belonged to an aristocrat wealthy family who were known for their wealth. In thesis written by Joya Chatterji, Nazimuddin was described for unquestionable loyalty to British administration in India:\n\nBy 1934, the family had estates that covered almost 200,000 acres and was well spread over seven district of Eastern Bengal, together with Shillong and Assam with an yearly rent of ₤120,000 ($2,736,497.94 in 2017). By 1960s, the majority of estate was relocated from East Pakistan to the different areas of Pakistan, leaving very little of his estate in East.\n\nHe was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1926, and was knighted in 1934 by the King-Emperor, George V, when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE).\n\nBy the Government of Pakistan, Nazimuddin has been honored from time to time after his death. In Karachi, the residential areas, Nazimabad and North Nazimabad in suburbs of Karachi, had been named after his name. In Islamabad, there is a road intersection, Nazimuddin Road, that has been named in his honor; while in Dacca, there is also a road after his namesake.\n\nIn his honour, the Pakistan Post issued a commemorative stamp in accordance to his respect.\n\n\n\"Current Events Biography\", 1949\n\n"}

He was educated at St Paul's School, London, and Hertford College, Oxford, where he took a second in Classical Moderations (Greek and Latin) in 1910, a first in Greats (Philosophy and Ancient History) in 1912 and a first in Theology in 1913. He then trained for the ministry at St Michael's College, Llandaff.\n\nHe was ordained a deacon of the Church of England in 1913, after a year at Llandaff. He served briefly as a curate at St Mark's Church, Portsmouth, then in 1914, in a meteoric promotion, he became vice-principal of St Edmund Hall, Oxford. In 1919 he was elected tutor in theology and dean of divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford. He was appointed professor of Christian apologetics the General Theological Seminary, New York City, in 1925.

He was also general secretary of the Edinburgh world conference on faith and order in 1937. From 1944 to 1958, he was Oxford's Regius Professor of Divinity. Twice nominated for episcopal office, he declined to become Bishop of Carlisle, and also refused the bishopric of Monmouth in 1940 in a move which some in the Church in Wales believe deprived the Province of a new and invigorating presence among its prelates. He delivered the Gifford lectures, \"For Faith and Freedom\", from 1955 to 1957 at Glasgow University. From 1954 until 1966 (some of this time overlapping with his positions in Oxford) he was Warden of William Temple College, Rugby.

{"id": "1268501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1268501", "title": "Neurophenomenology", "text": "Neurophenomenology\n\nNeurophenomenology refers to a scientific research program aimed to address the hard problem of consciousness in a pragmatic way. It combines neuroscience with phenomenology in order to study experience, mind, and consciousness with an emphasis on the embodied condition of the human mind. The field is very much linked to fields such as neuropsychology, neuroanthropology and behavioral neuroscience (also known as biopsychology) and the study of phenomenology in psychology.\n\nThe label was coined by C. Laughlin, J. McManus and E. d'Aquili in 1990. However, the term was appropriated and given a distinctive understanding by the cognitive neuroscientist Francisco Varela in the mid-1990s, whose work has inspired many philosophers and neuroscientists to continue with this new direction of research.\n\nPhenomenology is a philosophical method of inquiry of everyday experience. The focus in phenomenology is on the examination of different phenomena (from Greek, \"phainomenon\", \"that which shows itself\") \"as they appear to consciousness\", i.e. in a first-person perspective. Thus, phenomenology is a discipline particularly useful to understand how is it that appearances present themselves to us, and how is it that we attribute meaning to them.\n\nNeuroscience is the scientific study of the brain, and deals with the third-person aspects of consciousness. Some scientists studying consciousness believe that the exclusive utilization of either first- or third-person methods will not provide answers to the difficult questions of consciousness.\n\nHistorically, Edmund Husserl is regarded as the philosopher whose work made phenomenology a coherent philosophical discipline with a concrete methodology in the study of consciousness, namely the epoche. Husserl, who was a former student of Franz Brentano, thought that in the study of mind it was extremely important to acknowledge that consciousness is characterized by intentionality, a concept often explained as \"aboutness\"; consciousness is always consciousness \"of\" something. A particular emphasis on the phenomenology of embodiment was developed by philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty in the mid-20th century.\n\nNaturally, phenomenology and neuroscience find a convergence of common interests. However, primarily because of ontological disagreements between phenomenology and philosophy of mind, the dialogue between these two disciplines is still a very controversial subject. The influential critique of the ontological assumptions of computationalist and representationalist cognitive science, as well as artificial intelligence, made by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus has marked new directions for integration of neurosciences with an embodied ontology. The work of Dreyfus has influenced cognitive scientists and neuroscientists to study phenomenology and embodied cognitive science and/or enactivism. One of such cases is neuroscientist Walter Freeman, whose neurodynamical analysis has a marked Merleau-Pontyian approach. However, recent trends on the matter appear to reject Dreyfus's interpretation of Husserl while at the same time maintaining a high interest in the integration of Husserlian phenomenology into the sciences of mind, as demonstrated by Evan Thompson's recent work.\n\n\n\n"}

Regarding science as puzzle-solving, Kuhn explained normal science as slowly accumulating detail in accord with established broad theory, without questioning or challenging the underlying assumptions of that theory.\n\nKuhn stressed that historically the route to normal science could be a difficult one. Prior to the formation of a shared paradigm or research consensus, would-be scientists were reduced to the accumulation of random facts and unverified observations, in the manner recorded by Pliny the Elder or Francis Bacon, while simultaneously beginning the foundations of their field from scratch through a plethora of competing theories.\n\nArguably at least the social sciences remain at such a pre-paradigmatic level today.\n\nKuhn considered that the bulk of scientific work was that done by the 'normal' scientist, as they engaged with the threefold tasks of articulating the paradigm, precisely evaluating key paradigmatic facts, and testing those new points at which the theoretical paradigm is open to empirical appraisal.\n\nFor the normal scientist anomalies represent challenges to be puzzled out and solved \"within\" the paradigm. Only if an anomaly or series of anomalies resists successful deciphering long enough and for enough members of the scientific community will the paradigm itself gradually come under challenge, and perhaps be subjected to a paradigm shift.\n\nIn this way however, according to Kuhn, normal science possesses a built-in mechanism that ensures the relaxation of the restrictions that previously bound research, whenever the paradigm from which they derive ceases to function effectively.\n\nKarl Popper has criticised Kuhn's view of normal science as excessively conservative and dogmatic—though whether Kuhn is prescriptive or merely descriptive here is open to doubt. Popper, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Toulmin and Watkins have also questioned whether the contrast between normal science versus revolutionary science is as stark as portrayed by Kuhn.\n\nW. O.

Following Suzuki-roshi’s death, they accepted scholarships from the San Francisco Zen Center to study Buddhism in Japan. They lived and studied in Japan from 1973 to 1995. They founded the Beginner’s Mind Zen Center (originally the Northridge Zen Center) in 2004.\n\nPeter Schneider first studied with Shunryu Suzuki-roshi in 1962 and returned to continue in 1967. He served as the second director of Tassajara Zen Mountain Center, as well as president of the San Francisco Zen Center. Peter received priest ordination from Suzuki-roshi in 1970. In 2002 he received dharma transmission from Sojun Mel Weitsman-roshi of the Berkeley Zen Center. Peter is a member of the American Zen Teacher’s Association.\n\nJane Schneider studied with Shunryu Suzuki-roshi from 1967 until his death in 1971. She served as secretary for the San Francisco Zen Center. In 1973 Jane received priest ordination from Zentatsu Richard Baker-roshi. Currently she is studying with Myoan Grace Schireson, a dharma heir in the Suzuki-roshi tradition, in preparation for dharma transmission.\n\n"}

Doctor in Philosophy for Mainz University, Germany. He received Konex Prize in 1986 for his labor on ethics.\n\nAs well he is chairman of Argentine Association of Ethical Researches, fellow of National Academy of Sciences and honorary member of Argentine Association of Bioethics.\n\nHis researches started on axiology, especially the works of Nicolai Hartmann, from who he has translated many books. Afterward he made an approach to Discourse Ethics and became friend of one of his founders, Karl-Otto Apel. From many years he works in an original propose which he call \"ethics of convergence\".\n\nFrom the beginning of his philosophical career Ricardo Maliandi has researched on material ethics of values, especially Nicolai Hartmann's approach (see Maliandi's doctoral thesis, Mainz University, \"Wertobjektivität und Realitätserfahrung\"). Two problems were always under his attention in ethics: foundation and conflictivity. He was convinced the intuitionism of axiological ethics is not enough for a rigorous foundation, but aware as well of the very suggestions of Hartmann analysis on conflictive relations among values, ethical thinking of Maliandi develops as a pursuit of an ethical foundation non-intuitionist, that recognizes conflicts. Sometimes, this research was close to Philosophical Anthropology (see \"Cultura y conflicto\").\n\nIn his newest works are very important transcendental pragmatics and Discourse Ethics of Karl-Otto Apel. They both offer a new aprioristic foundation, but different of the intuitionist. Maliandi introduces, as a programmatic propose, an approaching between Harmtann's and Apel's ethics, in the sense of the conflictive structure of \"ethos\" (enfasized by Hartmann) and a pragmatic-trascendental reflexive foundation (held by Apel) (see, \"Transformación y síntesis\"). The aproristic axis that, despite of multiple differences of these approaches, linked these two philosophers, allows Maliandi to make a defense of universalism against the unilateral stressing of difference, as appeared in actual irrational trends (see \"Dejar la posmodernidad. La ética frente al irracionalismo actual\"). This effort is complemented with the development of a theory of reason and stresses its \"bidimensionality\" (foundation and critique) and its \"dialogicity\" (the fact that reason only works as dialogical communication as it is exposed in \"Volver a la razón\").\n\nMaliandi's ethical conception can be summarized, as he proposed, as \"ethics of convergence\", he continues working on this topic.

Religious attitudes and prioritization seem to begin shifting from Sacro-Clericalism, where authority is given to the church and its representatives, to Sacro-Egoism, where the individual assumes greatest authority. The role of the individual, the self, was elevated more than ever before and self-reliance was glamorized, epitomized, and utilized in society—even until the present.\n\nLiberal theologians like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and Tillich \". . . sought to anchor that faith in common human experience, and interpret it in ways that made sense within the modern worldview.\" Schleiermacher, known as the father of modern liberal theology, considered religion and Christianity to be \". . . the distinctly human awareness of something infinite beyond the self on whom the self is dependent for everything.\"\n\nThough first a subtle and infrequent occurrence, more and more the authority and centrality of the Church began to lose ground to the prominence of the individual. Culturally, the expression of religion and Christianity encountered \". . . a turn towards life lived by reference to one's own subjective experiences (relational as much as individualistic).\" Leaning on one's own understanding became an asset, not a detriment, to religious life and approval.\n\nAccording to Heelas and Woodhead, \"The subjectivities of each individual become a, if not the, unique source of significance, meaning and authority.\" Grasso continues this understanding stating, \"Liberalism's movement toward an ever deeper individualism receives signal expression in the ascendancy of the type of liberalism that dominates our intellectual scene, in the ascendancy . . . termed the liberalism of the unencumbered self.\" Starks and Robinson comment that modernists \". . . see individuals and not a deity as the ultimate arbiters of moral authority and hold to a largely individually directed universe.\" Religious focus has moved from the institution to the individual.\n\nCurrently, this shift can be observed in a variety of ways as mentioned earlier, most visibly in lowered membership and attendance numbers. This situation has been attributed to poor religious offerings, to a modern emphasis on the secular world, to ineffective participation and devotion of believers worldwide, or to the will of God (in some religious circles). While all these may be partially true, the danger is making a synecdoche of the products of decline and overestimating their importance and influence in religion.\n\nChristian society has never operated from a vacuum. Furseth and Repstad state, \"It is simply not true that individuals invent their own world-view in a void.\" From its earliest beginnings, this religious movement has interacted closely with culture, as did its founder. Thus, this interaction \". . . is two-way: Christianity both influences and is influenced by culture.\"\n\nFurthermore, the expression of Christian faith has never been static. Sociological studies of Religion such as the Kendal Project and the McMinnville Project aptly demonstrate a religious transformation from older traditional patterns. Sacro-Egoism suggests that at the heart and in the origins of Christianity and modern religion is a personalized, dynamic, individualistic faith. This is Sacro-Egoism.\n"}

The result of a semantic decomposition is a representation of meaning. This representation can be used for tasks, such as those related to artificial intelligence or machine learning. Semantic decomposition is common in natural language processing applications. \n\nThe basic idea of a semantic decomposition is taken from the learning skills of adult humans, where words are explained using other words. It is based on Meaning-text theory. Meaning-text theory is used as a theoretical linguistic framework= to describe the meaning of concepts with other concepts. \n\nGiven that an AI does not inherently have language, it is unable to think about the meanings behind the words of a language. An artificial notion of meaning needs to be created for a strong AI to emerge. AI today is able to capture the syntax of language for many specific problems, but never establishes meaning for the words of these languages, nor is it able to abstract these words to higher-order concepts \n\nCreating an artificial representation of meaning requires the analysis of what meaning is. Many terms are associated with meaning, including semantics, pragmatics, knowledge and understanding or word sense. Each term describes a particular aspect of meaning, and contributes to a multitude of theories explaining what meaning is. These theories need to be analyzed further to develop an artificial notion of meaning best fit for our current state of knowledge.\n\nRepresenting meaning as a graph is one of the two ways that both an AI cognition and a linguistic researcher think about meaning (connectionist view). Logicians utilize a formal representation of meaning to build upon the idea of symbolic representation, whereas description logics describe languages and the meaning of symbols. This contention between 'neat' and 'scruffy' techniques has been discussed since the 1970s. \n\nResearch has so far identified semantic measures and with that Word-sense disambiguation (WSD) - the differentiation of meaning of words - as the main problem of language understanding. As an AI-complete environment, WSD is a core problem of natural language understanding. AI approaches that use knowledge-given reasoning creates a notion of meaning combining the state of the art knowledge of natural meaning with the symbolic and connectionist formalization of meaning for AI. The abstract approach is shown in Figure. First, a connectionist knowledge representation is created as a semantic network consisting of concepts and their relations to serve as the basis for the representation of meaning.\n\nThis graph is built out of different knowledge sources like WordNet, Wiktionary, and BabelNET. The graph is created by lexical decomposition that recursively breaks each concept semantically down into a set of semantic primes. The primes are taken from the theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage, which has been analyzed for usefulness in formal languages. Upon this graph marker passing is used to create the dynamic part of meaning representing thoughts. The marker passing algorithm, where symbolic information is passed along relations form one concept to another, uses node and edge interpretation to guide its markers. The node and edge interpretation model is the symbolic influence of certain concepts.\n\nFuture work uses the created representation of meaning to build heuristics and evaluate them through capability matching and agent planning, chatbots or other applications of natural language understanding.\n\n"}

{"id": "2519504", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2519504", "title": "Smartha tradition", "text": "Smartha tradition\n\nSmartha tradition is a movement in Hinduism that developed during its classical period around the beginning of the Common Era. It reflects a Hindu synthesis of four philosophical strands: Mimamsa, Advaita, Yoga, and theism. The Smartha tradition rejects theistic sectarianism, and it is notable for the domestic worship of five shrines with five deities, all treated as equal – Vishnu, Shiva, Ganesha, Surya and Parvati (Shakti). The Smartha tradition contrasted with the older Shrauta tradition, which was based on elaborate rituals and rites. There has been considerable overlap in the ideas and practices of the Smartha tradition with other significant historic movements within Hinduism, namely Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism.\n\nThe Smartha tradition is aligned with Advaita Vedanta, and regards Adi Shankara as its founder or reformer. Shankara championed the ultimate reality is impersonal and \"Nirguna\" (attributeless) and any symbolic god serves the same equivalent purpose. Inspired by this belief, the Smartha tradition followers, along with the five Hindu gods include a sixth impersonal god in their practice. The tradition has been called by William Jackson as \"advaitin, monistic in its outlook\".\n\nThe term \"Smartha\" also refers to Brahmins who specialize in the Smriti corpus of texts named the Grihya Sutras, in contrast to Shrauta Sutras. Smartha Brahmins with their focus on the Smriti corpus, contrast from Srauta Brahmins who specialize in the Sruti corpus, that is rituals and ceremonies that follow the Vedas.\n\nSmartha is an adjective derived from Smriti (). The smriti are a specific body of Hindu texts usually attributed to an author, traditionally written down but constantly revised, in contrast to Śrutis (the Vedic literature) considered authorless, that were transmitted verbally across the generations and fixed.\n\nSmartha has several meanings:\n\nIn Smartha tradition context, the term \"Smartha\" means \"follower of Smriti\". Smartha is specially associated with a \"sect founded by Shankaracharya\", states Monier Williams.\n\nThe Vedanga texts, states Alf Hiltebeitel, are Smriti texts that were composed in the second half of the Vedic period that ended around 500 BCE. The Vedanga texts include the Kalpa (Vedanga) texts consisting of the Srautasutras, Grihyasutras and Dharmasutras, many of which were revised well past the Vedic period. The Grihyasutras and Dharmasutras, states Hiltebeitel, were composed between 600 BCE and 400 CE, and these are sometimes called the Smarthasutras, the roots of the Smriti tradition. The Smriti texts accept the knowledge in the Sruti (Ve , the Mimamsa and Vedanta have sometimes been called the \"Smartha\" schools which emphasize the Vedas with reason and other \"pramanas\", in contrast to \"Haituka\" schools which emphasize \"hetu\" (cause, reason) independent of the Vedas while accepting the authority of the Vedas. Of the two Smartha traditions, Mimamsa focussed on Vedic ritual traditions, while Vedanta focussed on Upanishadic knowledge tradition.\n\nAround the start of the common era, and thereafter, a syncretism of \"Haituka\" schools (Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Samkhya and Yoga), the \"Smartha\" schools (Mimamsa, Vedanta) with ancient theistic ideas (bhakti, tantric) gave rise to a growth in traditions such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism and Shaktism. Hiltebeitel and Flood locate the origins of a revived orthodox Smartha Tradition in the (early) Classical Period of Hinduism, particularly with nondualist (Advaita) interpretation of Vedanta, around the time when different Hindu traditions emerged from the interaction between Brahmanism and local traditions.\n\nThe revived Smartha Tradition attempted to integrate varied and conflicting devotional practices, with its ideas of nondual experience of Atman (self, soul) as Brahman. The rapprochement included the practice of \"pancayatana-puja\" (five shrine worship), wherein a Hindu could focus on any \"saguna\" deity of choice (\"istadevata\") such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Surya or Ganesha, as an interim step towards realizing the \"nirguna\" Brahman. The growth of this Smartha Tradition began in the Gupta period (4th-5th century CE), and likely was dominated by Dvija classes, in particular the Brahmins, of the early medieval Indian society. This Smartha Tradition competed with other major traditions of Hinduism such as Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism. The ideas of Smartha Tradition were historically influential, creative with concepts such as of Harihara (half Shiva, half Vishnu deity) and Ardhanarishvara (half woman, half man deity), and many of the major scholars of Shaivism, Vaishnavism, Shaktism and Bhakti movement came out of the Smartha Tradition.\n\nMedieval era scholars such as Vedanta Desika and Vallabhacharya recognized Smartha Tradition as competing with Vaishnavism and other traditions. According to Jeffrey Timm, for example, in verse 10 of the \"Tattvarthadipanibandha\", Vallabhacharya states that, \"Mutually contradictory conclusions are non-contradictory when they are considered from their respective contexts, like Vaishnava, Smartha, etc.\"\n\nAccording to Murray Milner Jr., a professor of Sociology, the Smartha tradition refers to \"Hindus who tend toward Brahmanical orthodoxy in both thought and behavior\". Smarthas are usually committed to a \"relatively unified Hinduism\" and they reject extreme forms of sectarian isolationism, reminiscent of the European discourse about church and Christian sects. The tradition, states Milner, has roots that emerged sometime between 3rd century BCE and 3rd century CE, likely in response to the growth of Jainism and Buddhism. It reflected a Hindu synthesis of four philosophical strands: Mimamsa, Advaita, Yoga and theism.\n\nSmartha tradition emerged initially as a synthesis movement to unify Hinduism into a nonsectarian form based on the Vedic heritage. It accepted \"varnasrama-dharma\", states Bruce Sullivan, which reflected an acceptance of \"Varna\" (caste/class) and \"ashrama\" (four stages of human life) as a form of social and religious duty. In the later second half of the 1st millennium, Adi Shankara reformed and brought ideas to the movement in the form of the Advaita Vedanta philosophy. According to Upinder Singh, the Smartha tradition's religious practice emerged as a transformation of Brahmanism and can be described as Hinduism. Smartha as a tradition emphasized all gods as equal and different ways of perceiving the all-pervasive metaphysical impersonal Brahman.\n\nThe adjective \"Smārtha\" is also used to classify a Brahmin who adheres to the Smriti corpus of texts.\n\nSmartha Brahmins specialize in the Smriti corpus of texts, are differentiated from Srauta Brahmins who specialize in the Sruti corpus of texts such as the Brahmanas layer embedded inside the Vedas. Smartha Brahmins are also differentiated from Brahmins who specialize in the Agamic (non-Vedic, Tantra) literature such as the Adi Shaiva Brahmins, Sri Vaishnava Brahmins and Shaiva Kashmiri Pandits. However, these identities are not clearly defined, and active groups such as \"Agamic Smartha Saiva Brahmins\" have thrived.\n\nVishwakarmas are artisans found in South India, such as in the state of Karnataka. They are known for their traditional expertise and skills as blacksmiths, carpenters, coppersmiths, sculptors and goldsmiths. Smartha Vishwakarmas are vegetarian artisans who follow the Smartha tradition. They contrast with Vaishnava Vishwakarmas who follow the Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism and some of whom may consume non-vegetarian food. The re-marriage of widows is a tradition found among the Smartha Vishwakarmas, but has been atypical among Vaishnava Vishwakarma.\n\nAccording to Brouwer, examples of Smartha Vishwakarmas include Niligundapanta (traditionally blacksmiths and carpenters), Konnurpanta (all five artisan trades) and Madipattar (goldsmiths). The Smartha Vishwakarmas are not considered to be Brahmins.\n\nAccording to Smarthism, supreme reality, Brahman, transcends all of the various forms of personal deity. The Smarthas follow an orthodox Hindu philosophy, which means they accept the Vedas, and the ontological concepts of Atman and Brahman therein.\n\nThe Smartha Tradition accepts two concepts of Brahman, which are the \"saguna Brahman\" – the Brahman with attributes, and \"nirguna Brahman\" – the Brahman without attributes. The \"nirguna Brahman\" is the unchanging Reality, however, the \"saguna Brahman\" is posited as a means to realizing this \"nirguna Brahman\". The concept of the \"saguna Brahman\" is considered in this tradition to be a useful symbolism and means for those who are still on their spiritual journey, but the saguna concept is abandoned by the fully enlightened once he or she realizes the identity of their own soul with that of the \"nirguna Brahman\". A Smartha may choose any \"saguna\" deity (\"istadevata\") such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, Surya, Ganesha or any other, and this is viewed in Smartha Tradition as an interim step towards realizing the \"nirguna\" Brahman and its equivalence to one's own Atman.\n\nThe Smarthas evolved a kind of worship which is known as Panchayatana puja. In this Puja, one or more of the five Hindu Deities (Surya, Shiva, Vishnu, Ganesha and Devi or Shakti) are the objects of veneration. The five symbols of the major Gods are placed on a round open metal dish called Panchayatana, the symbol of the deity preferred by the worshiper being in the center. A similar arrangement is also seen in the medieval temples, in which the central shrine housing the principal Deity is surrounded by four smaller shrines containing the figures of the other deities. Some of the Smarthas of South India add a sixth god Kartikeya (See Shanmata). According to Basham, \"[m]any upper-class Hindus still prefer the way of the Smarthas to Saiva and Vaisnava forms of worship\".\n\nTraditionally, Sri Adi Shankaracharya (8th century) is regarded as the greatest teacher and reformer of the Smartha tradition.\n\nAccording to Hiltebeitel, Adi Shankaracharya established the nondualist interpretation of the Upanishads as the touchstone of a revived \"Smartha\" tradition:\n\nSmarthas follow the Hindu scriptures. Like all traditions within Hinduism, they accept as an epistemic premise that Śruti (Vedic literature) is a reliable source of knowledge. The Śruti includes the four Vedas including its four layers of embedded texts - the Samhitas, the Brahmanas, the Aranyakas and the early Upanishads. Of these, the Upanishads are the most referred to texts.\n\nThe identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\", and their unchanging, eternal nature, are the basic truths in this tradition. The emphasis in Vedic texts here is the \"jnana-kanda\" (knowledge, philosophical speculations) in the Upanishadic part of the Vedas, not its \"karma-kanda\" (ritual injunctions). Along with the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita and Brahma Sutras are the central texts of the Advaita Vedanta tradition, providing the truths about the identity of \"Atman\" and \"Brahman\" and their changeless nature.\n\nThe Brahmasutra is considered as the \"Nyaya Prasthana\" (canonical base for reasoning). The Bhagavad Gita is considered as the \"Smriti Prasthana\". The text relies on other \"Smritis\", such as the Vedangas, Itihasa, Dharmasastras, Puranas and others. Some of this \"smriti\" literature incorporated shramanic and Buddhist influences of the period from about 200 BC to about AD 300 and the emerging \"bhakti\" tradition into the Brahmanical fold.\n\nThe Smartha Tradition includes temples and monasteries. More Smartha temples are found in West and South India, than in North India.\n\nAdi Shankara is one of the leading scholars of the Smartha Tradition, and he founded some of the most famous monasteries in Hinduism. These have hosted the under four Maṭhas, with the headquarters at Dwarka in the West, Jagannatha Puri in the East, Sringeri in the South and Badrinath in the North. Each math was headed by one of his disciples, called Shankaracharya, who each independently continued the Advaita Vedanta Sampradaya. The ten Shankara-linked Advaita monastic orders are distributed as follows: Bharati, Puri and Saraswati at Sringeri, Aranya and Vana at Puri, Tirtha and Ashrama at Dwarka, and Giri, Parvata and Sagara at Badrinath.\n\nThe mathas which Shankara built exist until today, and continue the teachings and influence of Shankara.\n\nThe table below gives an overview of the four largest Advaita Mathas founded by Adi Shankara, and their details. However, evidence suggests that Shankara established more \"mathas\" locally for Vedanta studies and its propagation, states Hartmut Scharfe, such as the \"four mathas in the city of Trichur alone, that were headed by Trotaka, Sureshvara, Hastamalaka and Padmapada\".\n\nThe Sringeri Sharada monastery founded by Jagatguru Sri Adi Shankaracharya in Karnataka is the centre of the Smartha sect.\n\nOther Advaita Vedanta mathas following Smartha Tradition include:\n\nSome of the prominent Smartha teachers:\n\nVaitheespara notes the adherence of the Smartha Brahmans to \"the pan-Indian Sanskrit-brahmanical tradition\" and their influence on pan-Indian nationalism:\n\n\n\n"}

The Abode is located in the eastern heights of the Taconic Mountains in New Lebanon, New York, and housed in historic Shaker buildings built between 1834 and 1870.\n\nThe described intent of the Abode as a community is to \"collectively embody spiritual awakening,\" through \"mutual commitment to practicing...the Sufi teachings,\" \"shared devotion to the ideals of Love, Harmony and Beauty, and to the specific transformational work whereby these ideals are progressively realized,\" for \"mutual dedication and visionary collaboration.\"\n\nMost of the Abode's Main Campus structures were built in the mid-19th century by the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village community as housing and workspaces for their South Family group. Formally established in 1787, the New Lebanon Shaker Society (renamed the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society in 1861) was the second major Shaker society formed in the recently created United States of America. The society established its home at the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, which became the primary Shaker spiritual residential community.\n\nThe Mount Lebanon Shaker Village was organized into Family groups living in clustered buildings sited around the property. Three main groups of buildings survive as of 2010. The Church Family property is occupied by the Darrow School, a private residential high school. The North Family property is occupied and being restored by the Shaker Museum, Mount Lebanon. The South Family property was owned by the Shaker Village Work Group (a camp for urban teenagers established in 1947 as the Shaker Village Work Camp and later renamed) until it was purchased in 1975 for the Sufi Order International, which established it as a new residential spiritual community—The Abode of the Message.\n\nToday the Abode continues as one of the few enduring intentional communities among those that arose by the thousands from North America's new spirituality movement and the 1960s counterculture. The Abode community meets for common meals in the Rezak Hall dining room, also used for that purpose by the South Family Shakers. There are also regular classes and events associated with the activities of the Sufi Order International. The Abode’s revenue sources include fees from residents, leasing space on the Main Campus to the Flying Deer Nature Center, operating a meditation Retreat Center, and event facility rentals of meeting and housing space on the Main Campus and the Mountain Camp.\n\nThe Abode community in 2010 included approximately 40 adults and 10 to 12 children living in houses along Chair Factory Road and apartments in Main Campus buildings, as well as off-site members living in the area. In 2016, the residential population was approximately 24 adults and 6 children. The population expands with temporary staff and students during the summer. The Abode’s extended community includes past residents and the many Inayati Order members who regularly or occasionally attend events at the Abode, numbering several thousand.\n\nThe \"Abode Programs Office\" administers event scheduling and oversees operations and services for the Abode. The Office operates the Main Campus and the Mountain Camp, and other Abode facilities that are available to rent for public events.

The Office manages programs for volunteer interns, work-exchange residents, as well as \"Khidmat,\" the Abode’s combined work service-study program.\n\nThe \"Abode Retreat Center\" arranges individual, spiritual meditative retreats of three to forty days, either in a private retreat hut or cabin, or a room in the Meditation Hall. A certified retreat guide meets at least once daily with the retreatant to suggest the day's schedule of practices and to offer feedback on the retreatant's experience.\n\nThe Inayati Order \"Secretariat\" is the headquarters for The Inayati Order, which founded the Abode of the Message. \"Suluk Academy\" is a school of esoteric studies that holds classes at the Abode as part of a program of two-year courses of intensive study, training and practice in the Sufi path.

Most of its shared community facilities are grouped within two areas, the Main Campus and the Mountain Conference Center.\n\nThe Main Campus is a cluster of buildings at the south end of Darrow Road, most of which are the original South Family structures of the Mount Lebanon Shaker Village, demonstrating \"preservation through use.\" Many of the buildings are named for spiritual qualities that Sufis value, drawn from the 99 Names of God in Islam. \"Rezak\" was the South Family's main communal building and now contains the library and community dining room. \"Vakil\" houses the Abode Programs Office, and served as the Shaker chair-caning shop. \"Mughni\" is the former Shaker trustees building. \"Fatah\" (the 1867 Shaker women's workhouse) holds men's and women's dorms. Recently renovated, the \"Shaker Barn\" was built in 1850 as a horse barn, but now hosts offices and art studios. The \"Meditation Hall\" was built in 1975 by Abode community members, and is used as a sacred space used for public events. Three personal retreat huts are located in the \"Retreat Hut Field\" on the hill behind the Meditation Hall, and several retreat huts and cabins are situated beside a stream south of the Shaker Barn.\n\nThe \"Mountain Camp\" hosts large group events for the Abode and The Inayati Order as well as being available as a woodland conference center.

{"id": "10593425", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10593425", "title": "Truth claim", "text": "Truth claim\n\nA truth claim is a proposition or statement that a particular person or belief system holds to be true. The term is commonly used in philosophy in discussions of logic, metaphysics, and epistemology, particularly when discussing the doctrinal statements of religions; however, it is also used when discussing non-religious ideologies.\n\nA major division of truth claims is that between positive and negative truth claims. Positive truth claims proclaim the existence of an object or entity. Negative truth claims, which are the opposite of truth claims, proclaim the non-existence of an object or entity.\n\nSome religions make strong absolutist truth claims about the laws of nature and human nature while others make relativist or universalist truth claims.\n\nIn the post-modern period Hinduism is generally known to be Universalist and accepts\nall other religions to be true and valid. Mahatma Gandhi is credited to be the original proponent. However, this seems to be true from a socio-political perspective, since Hinduism itself is a congregation of large numbers of individual sects and peoples that have long lived in harmony among themselves without persecuting each other. But if one goes into what is in the scriptures of\nmore organised Hindu sects like Vedanta; we do find exclusive truth claims.\n\nBhagavad Gita says -\n\n\"ye me matamidaM nityamanutishhThanti maanavaaH .\"\n\"shraddhaavanto.anasuuyanto muchyante te.api karmabhiH .. 3.31\"\n\nThose who continuously practice what I preach they will be freed from Karma.\n\n\"ye tvetadabhyasuuyanto naanutishhThanti me matam.h .\"\n\"sarvaGYaanavimuuDhaa.nstaanviddhi nashhTaanachetasaH .. 3.32\"\n\nBut those who, out of envy, disregard these teachings and do not practice them regularly, are to be considered bereft of all knowledge, befooled, and doomed to ignorance and bondage.\n\nA Hindu is expected to examine a truth claim based on his intellect. He can add or improve upon the vast ocean of Hindu philosophy. This is unlike religions such as Christianity and Islam, where, because of the truth claim is endowed as infallible, a contradiction of single verse is a contradiction of the entire claim.\n\nTraditionally Hinduism (more specifically Vedanta) considers itself to be eternal religion (Sanatana Dharma). Fundamental belief is that all beings are divine, that the human condition is one of ignorance to not recognize this divinity inside, and that direct experience of God is achievable for all human beings.\n\nIt has been debated as to whether science makes any truth claims of its own, or if it is a set of methods for evaluating or falsifying other truth claims.\n\nAgnosticism makes the claim that the existence or non-existence of any deity is unknown and possibly unknowable. This is a claim about what we can or do know, not a metaphysical claim as to the nature of the world.\n\nThe truth claims of atheism are divided between negative atheism, which does not accept the positive truth claims of religions, and positive atheism, which specifically claims the non-existence of deities (and other spiritual phenomena).\n\n"}
