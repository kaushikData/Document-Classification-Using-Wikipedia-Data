{"id": "4463070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=4463070", "title": "Abstractionism", "text": "Abstractionism\n\nAbstractionism is the theory that the mind obtains some or all of its concepts by abstracting them from concepts it already has, or from experience. One may, for example, abstract 'green' from a set of experiences which involve green along with other properties. Also, for example, one may abstract a generic concept like 'vegetable' from the already possessed concepts of its instances (carrot, broccoli, onion, etc.). This view was criticized by George Berkeley and Peter Geach.\n\nAbstractionism has its roots in Aristotle's writings, particularly those rejecting the Platonic theory of Forms. They were adopted and developed further by the Scholastics so that the doctrine became entrenched in the seventeenth century. John Locke also developed his own theory of abstract ideas although it was against the Scholastic theory of essences. For him, ideas originate through the senses and the materials or the sensory data provided by these become the basis of the way we form general ideas of classes of things. His theory contradicts the empiricist standpoint due to its focus on intuitive and demonstrative knowledge as demonstrated in Locke's recognition that pure mathematics and pure morals are founded on intuition and demonstration.\n\nThere are several modern versions of abstractionism and these include those developed by theorists such as Noam Chomsky and Jerry Fodor, who proposed that concepts are preformed at birth and that we learn to match the words of our language onto the pre-existing concepts. Chomsky, for instance, explained the \"deep structure\" of the Internet or the grammar of meaning hidden beneath the surface of words by citing that \"linguists isolate from an essentially heterogeneous linguistic reality a standard and homogeneous system, thus grounding abstraction.\" \n\nBerkeley's opposition to abstractionism is considered to be primarily directed at Locke's claim that words are made general through the mediation of general ideas. This is due to the view that Locke's argument is tantamount to claiming that the word \"triangle\" can be applied to many different triangles because the abstract general idea of the form is used as a template or standard when identifying new instances as being of the same sort.\n"}
{"id": "582453", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=582453", "title": "Age of Aquarius", "text": "Age of Aquarius\n\n\"Age of Aquarius\" is an astrological term denoting either the current or forthcoming astrological age, depending on the method of calculation. Astrologers maintain that an astrological age is a product of the earth's slow precessional rotation and lasts for 2,160 years, on average (26,000-year period of precession / 12 zodiac signs = 2,160 years).\n\nThere are various methods of calculating the length of an astrological age. In sun-sign astrology, the first sign is Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces, whereupon the cycle returns to Aries and through the zodiacal signs again. Astrological ages, however, proceed in the opposite direction (\"retrograde\" in astronomy). Therefore, the Age of Aquarius follows the Age of Pisces.\n\nThe approximate 2,150 years for each age corresponds to the average time it takes for the vernal equinox to move from one constellation of the zodiac into the next. This can be computed by dividing the earth's 25,800-year gyroscopic precession period by twelve, the number of zodiac constellations used by astrologers. According to different astrologers' calculations, approximate dates for entering the Age of Aquarius range from AD 1447 (Terry MacKinnell) to AD 3597 (John Addey).\n\nAstrologers do not agree on when the Aquarian age will start or even if it has already started. Nicholas Campion in \"The Book of World Horoscopes\" lists various references from mainly astrological sources for the start of the Age of Aquarius. Based on Campion's research, most published materials on the subject state that the Age of Aquarius arrived in the 20th century (29 claims), with the 24th century in second place with twelve claimants.\n\nAstrological ages exist as a result of precession of the equinoxes. The slow wobble of the earth's spin axis on the celestial sphere is independent of the diurnal rotation of the Earth on its own axis and the annual revolution of the earth around the sun. Traditionally this 25,800-year-long cycle is calibrated, for the purposes of determining astrological ages, by the location of the sun in one of the twelve zodiac constellations at the vernal equinox, which corresponds to the moment the sun rises above the celestial equator, marking the start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere each year. Roughly every 2,150 years the sun's position at the time of the vernal equinox will have moved into a new zodiacal constellation. However zodiacal constellations are not uniform in size, leading some astrologers to believe that the corresponding ages should also vary in duration. This however is a contentious issue among astrologers.\n\nIn 1929 the International Astronomical Union defined the edges of the 88 official constellations. The edge established between Pisces and Aquarius officially locates the beginning of the Aquarian Age around AD 2600. Many astrologers dispute this approach because of the varying sizes and overlap between the zodiacal constellations.\n\nAstrologers believe that an astrological age affects humanity, possibly by influencing the rise and fall of civilizations or cultural tendencies. \n\nTraditionally, Aquarius is associated with electricity, computers, flight, democracy, freedom, humanitarianism, idealism, modernization, astrology, nervous disorders, rebellion, nonconformity, philanthropy, veracity, perseverance, humanity, and irresolution.\n\nThe variations of views among astrologers include:\n\nThe expression \"Age of Aquarius\" in popular culture usually refers to the heyday of the hippie and New Age movements in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nAlthough more rock than new-age in genre, the 1967 musical \"Hair\", with its opening song \"Aquarius\" and the memorable line \"This is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius\", brought the Aquarian age concept to the attention of audiences worldwide. However, the song further defines this dawning of the age within the first lines: \"When the Moon is in the seventh house and Jupiter aligns with Mars, then peace will guide the planets and love will steer the stars\". Astrologer Neil Spencer denounced the lyrics as \"astrological gibberish\", noting that Jupiter aligns with Mars several times a year and the moon is in the 7th House for two hours every day.\n\nThese lines are considered by many to be merely poetic license, though some people take them literally. An example is the identification of Valentine's Day 2009 as the \"perfect alignment to support our collective manifestation of love and peace and dawning of the Age of Aquarius\". In popular culture, the NBC television show \"Aquarius\", which premiered on May 28, 2015, is based on the Charles Manson case. The name relates to the \"dawn of Aquarius,\" also commonly referred to as the New Age way of thinking.\n\n"}
{"id": "41415443", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=41415443", "title": "Alexandre Mercereau", "text": "Alexandre Mercereau\n\nAlexandre Mercereau (Paris, 22 October 1884 – 1945) was a French symbolist poet and critic associated with Unanimism and the Abbaye de Créteil. He founded the Villa Médicis Libre, which helped impoverished artists and operated as charitable reformatory for delinquent teenagers. Mercereau's work inspired the revolutionary artistic movement of the early 20th century known as Cubism.\n\nBorn Alexandre Mercereau de la Chaume, he signed his first texts Eshmer-Valdor, a pseudonym he quickly abandoned. In 1901, at sixteen years of age, Mercereau's first verses were published; poetry and criticism in \"Oeuvre d'art international\". In 1904 he co-founded the magazine \"La Vie\", where he became assistant editor, drama critic, and columnist.\n\nIn 1905 he published \"Les Thuribulums affaissés\", a book of verse that attracted much attention. At the same time, he co-founded the Association Ernest-Renan. In 1906 he organized the French section of Salon exhibition and literary review \"La Toison d'Or\".\n\nIn 1907 he published \"Gens de là et d'ailleurs\". From 1907 to 1908 he co-founded and participated in the experience of the Abbaye de Créteil, a collective open to artists. Mercereau organized exhibitions of French artists in Moscow, Saint-Petersburg, Kiev, and Odessa. After World War I he published a pamphlet, \"L'Abbaye et le bolchevisme culturel\" (published by ), in which he denounced the attitude of Georges Duhamel and Charles Vildrac. From 1910 he co-directed with Paul Fort the Parisian literary review \"Vers et Prose\". In 1911 he created the literary section of the Salon d'Automne in Paris, called \"Comité d'initiative théâtrale\", consisting of public lectures by emerging authors at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. He subsequently co-founded the \"Revue indépendante\" and \"La Rue\", in addition to \"Vers et Prose\".\n\nMercereau was literary director at Jacques Povolozky & Cie publishing, director of Caméléon, a \"café littéraire\" in Montparnasse. In \"Histoire Contemporaine des Lettres Française de 1885 à 1914\" (Eugène Figuière), Ernest Florian-Parmentier writes \"[...] M. Mercereau seems endowed with all the qualities that lead almost inevitably to success.\n\nThe Abbaye de Créteil was a \"phalanstère\" utopian community founded during the fall of 1906 by Alexandre Mercereau, along with the poets , , Charles Vildrac, and the artist, theorist Albert Gleizes. The movement drew its inspiration from the \"Abbaye de Thélème,\" a fictional creation by Rabelais in his novel \"Gargantua\".\n\nAlbert Gleizes met the artists , Jacques d'Otémar and Josué Gaboriaud while in Amiens (1904), as well as the printer, Lucien Linard, who would run the printshop at the Abbaye de Créteil. At this time, the art critic Jean Valmy Baysse (and soon historian of the Comédie-Française), in collaboration with Alexandre Mercereau, René Arcos, Charles Vildrac and Georges Duhamel were invited to participate on a new journal, titled \"La Vie\".\n\nSymbolist poet and writer joined the group of writers and painters in 1905. Gleizes assisted in the formation of the Association Ernest Renan in December at the Théâtre Pigalle, in an attempt to counter the rise of militarist propaganda. In the process, publications and artwork tended towards a more popular and secular culture. Gleizes was in charge of the literary and artistic developments that organized poetry readings and street theatre.\n\nMercereau, Gleizes and others throughout 1906 worked on a concept established by Charles Vildrac of creating a self-supporting community of artists. The motivation was to develop their art free of commercial considerations. In Créteil, a small village outside Paris, they invested a house and grounds. Barzun paid the rent for the first six months, financed with his small inheritance. Gleizes and Vildrac moved in during the month of December. At the outset of 1907 the Abbaye de Créteil consisted of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel and Barzun joined the group periodically. The musician , later to become known as founder of the \"Fêtes du Peuple\" also participated intermittently. In 1906 Mercereau travelled to Moscow, where he met a group of Russian symbolist and Art Nouveau artists called Голубая роза (Blue Rose). There worked on a magazine publication and helped organize the French section of a salon exhibition called \"La Toison d'Or\" (Golden Fleece, Золотое руно). Simultaneously, he worked as a correspondent for the Abbaye de Créteil.\n\nHe returned to Paris in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife. At this time the Abbaye group supported itself through the printing (run by Linard and Gleizes) of high-quality material. The painters Berthold Mahn, Jacques d'Otémar and Henri Doucet visited periodically.\n\nA former student at the Académie Julian and a friend of Maurice Denis and Les Nabis, Henri Le Fauconnier was painting in a progressively geometric fashion. He exhibited his seascapes at the 1909 Salon des Indépendants, and would soon meet Albert Gleizes through Alexandre Mercereau the same year. Mercereau, perhaps, realized the extent of their common interests.\n\nMercereau founded the Villa Médicis Libre, in Villepreux, under the patronage of Fondation Georges Bonjean, to provide inexpensive accommodations for avant-garde artists living in difficulties. André Lhote and Raoul Dufy resided there in 1910.\n\nAccording to Albert Gleizes, Mercereau is responsible for having introduced him to Jean Metzinger, Robert Delaunay and Henri Le Fauconnier in 1910—the same year that Mercereau curated and included these artists in a Moscow exhibition, probably the first Jack of Diamonds Exhibition. Prior to meeting, Gleizes and Metzinger had been linked by Louis Vauxcelles' disparaging comments on \"des cubes blafards\" which likely referred to Metzinger's \"Portrait of Apollinaire\" (1909–10) and Gleizes' \"L'Arbre (The Tree)\" (1910) at the Salon des Indépendants. Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' \"Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne\" in a Russian exhibition of 1908.\n\n\"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity\", writes art historian Daniel Robbins, \"it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development\". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting.\n\nIn 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group—including , , Beauduin, , , , Marinetti, Brâncuși, and even Apollinaire and Salmon—became sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a \"Journée portes ouvertes\" at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of Futurism, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, and the Romanian sculptor Constantin Brâncuși.\n\n\"In poetry\", writes Robbins, \"this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's \"Real Allegory\" which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet \"did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought\".\n\nThis group of artists met regularly at Le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Indépendants, Apollinaire wrote:\n\n...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.\nThis conception is not based on the studies of Picasso and Braque (what became known years later as the analytical Cubism), which had annihilated subject matter almost entirely and confined it to exceedingly flat space. Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, Robert Delaunay and Fernand Léger. The subjects treated by these Cubists differed significantly from the isolated still lifes or figures chosen by Picasso and Braque.\n\nMercereau attempted to represent facets of time in his writings, much as Gleizes and Metzinger attempted to represent facets of space, time and form in their paintings.\n\nA painting by Gleizes entitled \"Man in a Hammock\" integrates the man into the landscape, forming a single image by virtue of a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes to accommodate all aspects of the scene. One of Mercereau's books can be seen in the painting, along with the still-life next to the sitter, the man, and the environment. All are symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects.\n\nThe man represented in the painting is very likely a portrait of Jean Metzinger. The book entitled \"Paroles devant la vie\", held prominently by the model was written by Mercereau in 1913. Gleizes had collaborated in founding the Abbaye de Créteil, and was very familiar with Mercereau's writings. Metzinger wrote an important text about Mercereau in 1911. Mercereau's publisher, , a year earlier had published \"Du \"Cubisme\"\", the Cubist manifesto written by Gleizes and Metzinger.\n\n\"Man in a Hammock\" is testament to the close association between Mercereau, Metzinger and Gleizes, and to their shared social, cultural and philosophical conviction that painting represented more than a fleeting glimpse of the world in which they lived, that by showing multiple facets of a subject captured at successive intervals in time simultaneously, a truer more complete image would emerge.\n\nIn 1914 he curated \"Moderní umění, 45th Exhibition of SVU Mánes\" in Prague. This \"Survey of Modern Art\" was one of the last prewar exhibitions in Prague. The exhibition included works by Alexander Archipenko, Georges Braque, Constantin Brâncuși, Robert Delaunay, André Derain, Marcel Duchamp, Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Albert Gleizes, Roger de La Fresnaye, Louis Marcoussis, Jean Marchand, Jean Metzinger, Piet Mondrian, Diego Rivera, Edvard Munch, Max Pechstein, Pablo Picasso, and Jacques Villon, in addition to Czech artists.\n\nBy 1914, Mercereau had met the Spanish sculptor Julio González and became his lifelong supporter and \nfriend.\n\n\n\n"}

It entirely differs from individual acts of animal cruelty in that it is an institutionalized animal exploitation. Coined in 1989 by Barbara Noske, it is one of the main topics of the critical animal studies. It is analogous to the term \"capitalism\" in human sociology.\n\nAnimal industrial complex, derived from the military–industrial complex of the 1950s, is the collective term used to \"describe the many traditions, institutions, and industries that transform animals into products and services for human consumption.\" It is an institutionalized violence against non-human animals that occur without any effective public opposition or government intervention. The phrase \"animal industrial complex\" was coined in 1989 by the Dutch cultural anthropologist and philosopher Barbara Noske in her book \"Humans and Other Animals\". In the book, she wrote, \"Animals have become reduced to mere appendages of computers and machines.” Sociologist Richard Twine later defined the concept as “partly opaque and multiple set of networks and relationships between the corporate (agricultural) sector, governments, and public and private science. With economic, cultural, social and affective dimensions it encompasses an extensive range of practices, technologies, images, identities and markets.\"\n\nThe origin of the animal industrial complex can be traced back to antiquity when humans began domesticating animals. However, it was only since 1945 that the animal industrial complex began to grow significantly. According to Kim Stallwood, the animal industrial complex is \"an integral part of the neoliberal, transnational order of increasing privatization and decreasing government intervention, favouring transnational corporations and global capital.\" According to Sorenson, two milestones mark the shift in human attitudes toward animals that empowered the animal industrial complex, namely, Chicago and its stockyards and slaughterhouses from 1865 and the post-World War II developments such as intensive factory farms, industrial fishing, and xenotransplantation. Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel \"The Jungle\" explicitly describes the mistreatment of animals during their lives until they end up at the slaughterhouse. Charles Patterson's \"Eternal Treblinka\" explains how the disassembly of animals in the slaughterhouses inspired Henry Ford's assembling of cars in factories, and how it further influenced the Third Reich in Nazi Germany in building concentration camps and gas chambers.\n\nThe animal industrial complex breeds animals in the billions in order to make products and services for human consumption. All these animals are considered legal property of the animal industrial complex. The animal industrial complex is said to have transformed the already confused relationship between human and non-human animals, significantly increasing the consumption and threatening human survival. The pervasive nature of the animal industrial complex is such that it evades attention.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "24524514", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=24524514", "title": "Aristotle's views on women", "text": "Aristotle's views on women\n\nAristotle's views on women influenced later Western thinkers, as well as Islamic thinkers, who quoted him as an authority until the end of the Middle Ages, influencing women's history.\n\nIn his \"Politics\", Aristotle saw women as subject to men, but as higher than slaves, and lacking authority; he believed the husband should exert political rule over the wife. Among women's differences from men were that they were, in his view, more impulsive, more compassionate, more complaining, and more deceptive. He gave the same weight to women's happiness as to men's, and in his \"Rhetoric\" stated that society could not be happy unless women were happy too. Whereas Plato stated that women, while inferior, should be educated, Aristotle appears to have disagreed.\n\nIn his theory of inheritance, Aristotle considered the mother to provide a passive material element to the child, while the father provided an active, ensouling element with the form of the human species.\n\nAristotle believed women were inferior to men. For example, in his work \"Politics\" (1254b13–14), Aristotle states \"as regards the sexes, the male is by nature superior and the female inferior, the male ruler and the female subject\". In \"Politics\" 1.12 he wrote, \"The slave is wholly lacking the deliberative element; the female has it but it lacks authority; the child has it but it is incomplete\". Cynthia Freeland wrote: \"Aristotle says that the courage of a man lies in commanding, a woman's lies in obeying; that 'matter yearns for form, as the female for the male and the ugly for the beautiful'; that women have fewer teeth than men; that a female is an incomplete male or 'as it were, a deformity'.\" Aristotle believed that men and women naturally differed both physically and mentally. He claimed that women are \"more mischievous, less simple, more impulsive ... more compassionate ... more easily moved to tears ... more jealous, more querulous, more apt to scold and to strike ... more prone to despondency and less hopeful ... more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, of more retentive memory [and] ... also more wakeful; more shrinking [and] more difficult to rouse to action\" than men. \n\nHe wrote that only fair-skinned women, not darker-skinned women, had a sexual discharge and climaxed. He also believed this discharge could be increased by eating of pungent foods. Aristotle thought a woman's sexual discharge was akin to that of an infertile or amputated male's. He concluded that both sexes contributed to the material of generation, but that the female's contribution was in her discharge (as in a male's) rather than within the ovary.\n\nAristotle explains how and why the association between man and woman takes on a hierarchical character by commenting on male rule over 'barbarians', or non-Greeks. \"By nature the female has been distinguished from the slave. For nature makes nothing in the manner that the coppersmiths make the Delphic knife – that is, frugally – but, rather, it makes each thing for one purpose. For each thing would do its work most nobly if it had one task rather than many. Among the barbarians the female and the slave have the same status. This is because there are no natural rulers among them but, rather, the association among them is between male and female slave. On account of this, the poets say that 'it is fitting that Greeks rule barbarians', as the barbarian and the slave are by nature the same.\" While Aristotle reduced women's roles in society, and promoted the idea that women should receive less food and nourishment than males, he also criticised the results: a woman, he thought, was then more compassionate, more opinionated, more apt to scold and to strike. He stated that women are more prone to despondency, more void of shame or self-respect, more false of speech, more deceptive, and of having a better memory.\n\nAristotle's inheritance model sought to explain how the parents' characteristics are transmitted to the child, subject to influence from the environment. In his view, an active, ensouling masculine element brought life to a passive female element. The system worked as follows. The father's semen and the mother's menses encode their parental characteristics. The model is partly asymmetric, as only the father's movements define the form or \"eidos\" of the human species, while the movements of both the father's and the mother's fluids define features other than the form, such as the father's eye colour or the mother's nose shape. The theory has some symmetry, as semen movements carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is hot enough to overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; but if it is too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance is thus particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending. The child's sex can be influenced by factors that affect temperature, including the weather, the wind direction, diet, and the father's age. Features other than sex also depend on whether the semen overpowers the menses, so if a man has strong semen, he will have sons who resemble him, while if the semen is weak, he will have daughters who resemble their mother.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, there should be \"political rule\" of the husband over the wife. \n\nAs for the differences between husband and wife, Aristotle says that these \"always\" consisted in external appearances, in speeches, and in honors. The household functions of a man and of a woman are different because his business is \"to get\" and hers \"to keep\". \n\nIn his \"Economics\", Aristotle wrote that it befits not a man of sound mind to bestow his person promiscuously, or have random intercourse with women; for otherwise the base-born will share in the rights of his lawful children, and his wife will be robbed of her honor due, and shame be attached to his sons. It is fitting that he should approach his wife in honor, full of self-restraint and awe, and in his conversation with her, should use only the words of a right-minded man, suggesting only such acts as are themselves lawful and honorable. Aristotle's thought that a wife was best honored when she saw that her husband was faithful to her, and that he had no preference for another woman, but before all others loves, trusts her and holds her as his own. Aristotle wrote that a husband should secure the agreement, loyalty, and devotion of his wife, so that whether he himself is present or not, there may be no difference in her attitude towards him, since she realizes that they are alike guardians of the common interests, and so when he is away she may feel that to her no man is kinder or more virtuous or more truly hers than her own husband.\n\nAristotle wrote that in Sparta, the legislator wanted to make the whole city (or country) hardy and temperate, and that he carried out his intention in the case of the men, but he overlooked the women, who lived in every sort of intemperance and wealth. He added that in those regimes in which the condition of the women was bad, half the city could be regarded as having no laws.\n\nAristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his \"Rhetoric\" that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too. In an article titled \"Aristotle's Account of the Subjection of Women\", Stauffer explains that Aristotle believed that in nature a common good came of the rule of a superior being. But he does not indicate a common good for men being superior to women. He uses the word κρείττων \"kreitton\" to indicate superiority, meaning stronger. Aristotle believed that rational reasoning is what made you superior over lesser beings in nature, yet still used the term meaning stronger, not more rational or intelligent.\n\nOn children, he said, \"And what could be more divine than this, or more desired by a man of sound mind, than to beget by a noble and honored wife children who shall be the most loyal supporters and discreet guardians of their parents in old age, and the preservers of the whole house? Rightly reared by father and mother, children will grow up virtuous, as those who have treated them piously and righteously deserve that they should...\"\n\nAristotle believed we all have a biological drive to procreate, to leave behind something to take the place and be similar to ourselves. This then justifies the natural partnership between man and woman. And each person has one specific purpose because we are better at mastering one specific trait rather than being adequate at multiple. For Aristotle, women's purpose is to give birth to children. Aristotle stressed that man and woman work together to raise the children and that how they raise them has a huge influence over the kind of people they become and thus the kind of society or community that everyone lives in.\n\nAristotle appears to disagree with Plato on the topic whether women ought to be educated, as Plato says that they must be. Both of them, however, consider women to be inferior. Plato in \"Timaeus\" (90e) claims that men who were cowards and were lazy throughout their life shall be reborn as women and in the \"Laws\" (781b), he offers his reasons why women should be educated: \"Because you neglected this sex, you gradually lost control of a great many things which would be in a far better state today if they had been regulated by law. A woman's natural potential for virtue is inferior to a man's, so she's proportionately a greater danger, perhaps even twice as great.\" Plato further establishes his opinion on the inferiority of women's \"natural potential\" by claiming in \"Republic\" (455d) that \"Women share by nature in every way of life just as men do, but in all of them women are weaker than men.\"\n\nPlato firmly believed in reincarnation and this was very important for the distinction he made between the nature of men and women. This was not the case for Aristotle, who saw the differences as biological. Plato discusses this matter with more detail in \"Timaeus\", where he states that men have a superior soul than women (42a): \"Humans have a twofold nature, the superior kind should be such as would from then on be called \"man\". He added, once again, that men who led bad lives shall be reborn as women (42b): \"And if a person lived a good life throughout the due course of his time, he would at the end return to his dwelling place in his companion star, to live a life of happiness that agreed with his character. But if he failed in this, he would be born a second time, now as a woman.\"\n\nPlato also appears to use the term \"womanish\" or \"female-like\" as an derogatory term implying inferiority and emotional instability, as this is clear from \"Republic\" 469d and 605e, amongst others.\n\nAristotle's assumptions on female coldness influenced Galen and others for almost two thousand years until the sixteenth century.\n\nJoyce E. Salisbury argues that the Church Fathers, influenced by Aristotle's opinions, opposed the practice of independent female ascetism because it threatened to emancipate women from men.\n\nIn his \"Sex and Character\", written in 1903, Otto Weininger explained that all people are composed of a mixture of the male and the female substance, and that these views are supported scientifically. Weininger cited Aristotle's views in the chapter \"Male and Female Psychology\" of his book.\n\n\n"}

It reaffirmed that the Church recommends the reading of the Scripture prior to and as a source of Christian prayer and meditation.\n\nSimilar warnings were issued in 2003 in \"A Christian reflection on the New Age\" which characterized New Age activities as essentially incompatible with Christian teachings and values.\n\nThis document of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. \n\nThe letter warns that \"euphoric states\" obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, a state that should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a \"flight from the self\", can degenerate into a form of self-absorption. The letter warns against concentration on the self, rather than on Christ, and states that:\nChristian prayer, ..., the communion of redeemed creatures with the intimate life of the Persons of the Trinity, based on Baptism and the Eucharist, source and summit of the life of the Church, implies an attitude of conversion, a flight from \"self\" to the \"You\" of God. Thus Christian prayer is at the same time always authentically personal and communitarian. It flees from impersonal techniques or from concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut.\nThe letter also warns that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation \"can degenerate into a cult of the body\" and that equating bodily states with mysticism \"could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations.\"\n\nThe document has seven sections:\n\nPope John Paul II later referred to the document in addresses at a general audience in 1999 and to a particular group in 2003, using it as an example of how Christians need to focus their prayers. He referred to it also when saying, in the letter with which he marked the closing of the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, that, by opening our heart to the love of God, prayer also opens it to the love of our brothers and sisters, and makes us capable of shaping history according to God's plan.\n\nIn 2003, the Vatican issued further warnings regarding New Age practices including meditation. Monsignor Michael Fitzgerald stated at the Vatican conference on \"A Christian Reflection on the New Age\" that the \"Church avoids any concept that is close to those of the New Age\". Cardinal Paul Poupard, head of the Pontifical Council for Culture, said that the \"New Age is a misleading answer to the oldest hopes of man\". According to the review of the document in \"The Tablet\" \"there is never any doubt in the document that New Age is incompatible with and hostile to the core beliefs of Christianity\".\n\n\n"}

It was first coined in 1853 by Daniel Deniehy who made a speech lambasting the attempt by William Wentworth to establish a titled aristocracy in the New South Wales government. This speech came to be known as the \"Bunyip Aristocracy speech\".\n\nDeniehy made speeches opposing the new self-titled Australian aristocracy in the Victorian theatre and on the soapbox at Circular Quay.\n\nIn response to Wentworth's proposal to create a hereditary peerage in New South Wales, Deniehy's satirical comments included: \"\"Here, we all know the common water mole was transferred into the duck-billed platypus, and in some distant emulation of this degeneration, I suppose we are to be favoured with a \"bunyip aristocracy.\"\" (The bunyip is an Ancestral Being of Aboriginal Dreaming.) Deniehy's ridicule caused the idea to be dropped.\n\nAmong those singled out in his speech by Deniehy was James MacArthur (1798–1867), the son of John MacArthur, who had been nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1839 and was later (1859) elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly (the lower house was only created in 1856): \"Next came the native aristocrat James MacArthur, he would he supposed, aspire to the coronet of an earl, he would call him the Earl of Camden, and he suggests for his coat of arms a field vert, the heraldic term for green, and emblazoned on this field should be a rum keg of a New South Wales order of chivalry.\"\n\nThe strong popular support for Deniehy's views caused the abandonment of the proposal to which he was responding. It probably also delayed the introduction of an Australian honours system. The Order of Australia was not introduced until 1975. Until that time Australians were awarded British honours.\n\n'Bunyip aristocracy' is now a pejorative term for those Australians who consider themselves to be aristocrats.\n\n\"Note: Deniehy had a habit of writing speeches and articles that addressed himself in the third person\"\n\nA Committee, consisting of Messrs. Charles Cowper, T.A. Murray, George Macleay, E. Deas Thomson, J.H. Plunkett, Dr. Douglas, W. Thurlow, James Macarthur, James Martin, and W.C. Wentworth, appointed on the motion of W.C.Wentworth, held its first meeting, Sydney, 27 May 1853. Fifteen meetings were called. Half the members did not attend the meetings. The Bill was reported 28 July 1853. It was almost universally condemned by the people and a large public meeting was called to oppose it. In the advertisement convening the meeting were the following paragraphs :\nThe meeting was addressed by Sir Henry Parkes and other Liberals, and the result of the agitation was that the most objectionable clause, to create an hereditary colonial peerage, was struck out.\n\n"}

Currently no downloads are made available. CIETmap integrates epidemiological analysis tools with raster and vector mapping capabilities geared towards decision-making for planners. It includes a Windows interface with the statistical programming language, R.\n\nNeil Andersson conceived of and designed CIETmap and, with Steven Mitchell, defined its functionality. DM Solutions Group initiated the programming and interface design and Mario Beauchamp now maintains it. Development funding included contributions from the Canadian Assembly of First Nations, CIDA, IDRC and CIHR.\n\nCIETmap is written in Python and uses PyGTK for its graphical interface. The raster and vector mapping is handled by a custom library built on top of the GTK+, GDAL and GtkGLExt libraries. NumPy provides analytical and calculation support and RPy is the Python access to R. The CIET group is currently testing CIETmap to make it available to communities and researchers. Once released, CIETmap will be freely available under the GNU General Public License.\n\nCIETmap integrates epidemiological and geomatic analysis on a single platform:\n\nEpidemiological analysis: \nUsing commands similar to those in EpiInfo, CIETanalysis produces basic frequencies (like the proportion with a given disease) through to multivariate models of gains (like the proportion that can be \"saved\" by a given intervention). Users can generate descriptive stats (mean, standard deviation, standard error); odds ratios, risk difference, gains and confidence intervals. An interface with R gives access to most statistical capabilities available in that language; some of these are available through customised drop-down menus. CIETmap can import data in other formats as SPSS, dBase or Excel. Other features are available through user friendly interfaces such as meta-analysis, regression modelling, and Bayesian inference.\n\nMapping: The CIETmap module creates interpolated raster maps out of data from sample communities. The software also adjusts for over- or under-representation in the sample communities during the interpolation. It then displays user defined ranges with an associated legend. If they choose, users can see the maps in three dimensions and from different angles. CIETmap can also classify or display administrative boundaries and geographic features, as well as pictorial symbols. A morph/animation module can help make predictions based on epidemiological risk analysis (such as the likely impact of an intervention), or show changes in a situation over time –i.e.: data from repeat surveys. It does this through animation, which makes it easier for viewers to follow the changes, as they happen –or would happen- in each place on the map. These \"morph\" maps can either be run from within CIETmap or exported to external animated gifs.\n\nThe first published use of CIETmap's population weighted raster maps came from Afghanistan. These maps have wide applicability for communicating evidence.\n"}

Initially, Moscovici's conversion theory of minority influence began as a minority opinion that was rejected by many researchers, but eventually members of opposition validated it, thus confirming the theory's exact predictions. Asch's studies highlighted the power that majorities have over groups and their subsequent conformity, but Moscovici was more interested in the power exerted by minorities.\n\nContrasting the \"majority rules\" model of social influence, conversion theory maintains that disagreement within the group results in conflict, and that group members are motivated to reduce that conflict—either by changing their own opinions or attempting to get others to change. Minorities have a different process of influence, and Moscovici theorized that they do so by a \"validation process\" (majorities undergo comparison processes). If someone within the minority breaks that unanimity of the majority, this captures the majority's attention, causing them to consider their arguments and reasoning for disagreement (Moscovici, 1976). If the new information/opinions garnered from the minority are validated, this may sway the majority and lead to more long lasting changes than changes occurring via comparison processes. This is because validation leads to private acceptance, whereas comparison processes result in direct influence as members publicly comply. Generally, validation is a long process, so the effects of a minority are somewhat slower to emerge and identify.\n\nOne of the first tests of this theory was a reversal of Asch conformity experiments by adding two confederates in a six person group, and arranging for them to systematically disagree with the majority decision. Instead of lines, the participants judged (aloud) the color and brightness of a series of 36 colored slides (all were blue with varying luminosity). The confederates were told to consistently state \"green\" rather than \"blue.\" When tested alone, the error rate of participants was 0.25% (i.e., saying green when the answer was blue), but when tested in the presence of the green-saying confederates, the error rate increased to 8.4%, thus confirming the power of a minority (Forsyth, 2010).\n\n"}
{"id": "40341198", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40341198", "title": "Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)", "text": "Critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)\n\nCritical realism, a philosophical approach associated with Roy Bhaskar (1944–2014), combines a general philosophy of science (transcendental realism) with a philosophy of social science (critical naturalism) to describe an interface between the natural and social worlds.\n\nBhaskar developed a general philosophy of science that he described as transcendental realism and a special philosophy of the human sciences that he called critical naturalism. The two terms were combined by other authors to form the umbrella term critical realism.\n\nTranscendental realism attempts to establish that in order for scientific investigation to take place, the object of that investigation must have real, manipulable, internal mechanisms that can be \"actualized\" to produce particular outcomes. This is what we do when we conduct experiments. This stands in contrast to empiricist scientists' claim that all scientists can do is observe the relationship between cause and effect and impose meaning. Whilst empiricism, and positivism more generally, locate causal relationships at the level of events, critical realism locates them at the level of the generative mechanism, arguing that causal relationships are irreducible to empirical constant conjunctions of David Hume's doctrine; in other words, a constant conjunctive relationship between events is neither sufficient nor even necessary to establish a causal relationship.\n\nThe implication of this is that science should be understood as an ongoing process in which scientists improve the concepts they use to understand the mechanisms that they study. It should not, in contrast to the claim of empiricists, be about the identification of a coincidence between a postulated independent variable and dependent variable. Positivism/falsificationism are also rejected due to the observation that it is highly plausible that a mechanism will exist but either a) go unactivated, b) be activated, but not perceived, or c) be activated, but counteracted by other mechanisms, which results in its having unpredictable effects. Thus, non-realisation of a posited mechanism cannot (in contrast to the claim of some positivists) be taken to signify its non-existence. Falsificationism can be viewed at the statement level (naive falsificationism) or at the theorem level (more common in practice). In this way, the two approaches can be reconciled to some extent.\n\nCritical naturalism argues that the transcendental realist model of science is equally applicable to both the physical and the human worlds. However, when we study the human world we are studying something fundamentally different from the physical world and must, therefore, adapt our strategy to studying it. Critical naturalism, therefore, prescribes social scientific method which seeks to identify the mechanisms producing social events, but with a recognition that these are in a much greater state of flux than those of the physical world (as human structures change much more readily than those of, say, a leaf). In particular, we must understand that human agency is made possible by social structures that themselves require the reproduction of certain actions/pre-conditions. Further, the individuals that inhabit these social structures are capable of consciously reflecting upon, and changing, the actions that produce them—a practice that is in part facilitated by social scientific research.\n\nCritical realism has become an influential movement in British sociology and social science in general as a reaction to, and reconciliation of, postmodern critiques.\n\nSince Bhaskar made the first big steps in popularising the theory of critical realism in the 1970s, it has become one of the major strands of social scientific method, rivalling positivism/empiricism, and post-structuralism/relativism/interpretivism.\n\nAfter his development of critical realism, Bhaskar went on to develop a philosophical system he calls dialectical critical realism, which is most clearly outlined in his weighty book, \"Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom\".\n\nAn accessible introduction to Bhaskar's writings was written by Andrew Collier. Andrew Sayer has written accessible texts on critical realism in social science. Danermark et al. have also produced an accessible account. Margaret Archer is associated with this school, as is the ecosocialist writer Peter Dickens.\n\nDavid Graeber relies on critical realism, which he understands as a form of 'heraclitean' philosophy, emphasizing flux and change over stable essences, in his anthropological book on the concept of value, \"Toward an anthropological theory of value: the false coin of our own dreams\".\n\nRecently, attention has turned to the challenge of implementing critical realism in applied social research. An edited volume examined the use of critical realism for studying organizations (Edwards, O'Mahoney, and Vincent 2014). Other authors (Fletcher 2016, Parr 2015, Bunt 2018, Hoddy 2018) have discussed which specific research methodologies and methods are conducive (or not) to research guided by critical realism as a philosophy of science.\n\nHeterodox economists like Tony Lawson, Lars Pålsson Syll, Frederic Lee or Geoffrey Hodgson are trying to work the ideas of critical realism into economics, especially the dynamic idea of macro-micro interaction.\n\nAccording to critical realist economists, the central aim of economic theory is to provide explanations in terms of hidden generative structures. This position combines transcendental realism with a critique of mainstream economics. It argues that mainstream economics (i) relies excessively on deductivist methodology, (ii) embraces an uncritical enthusiasm for formalism, and (iii) believes in strong conditional predictions in economics despite repeated failures.\n\nThe world that mainstream economists study is the empirical world. But this world is \"out of phase\" (Lawson) with the underlying ontology of economic regularities. The mainstream view is thus a limited reality because empirical realists presume that the objects of inquiry are solely \"empirical regularities\"—that is, objects and events at the level of the experienced.\n\nThe critical realist views the domain of real causal mechanisms as the appropriate object of economic science, whereas the positivist view is that the reality is exhausted in empirical, i.e. experienced reality. Tony Lawson argues that economics ought to embrace a \"social ontology\" to include the underlying causes of economic phenomena.\n\nA development of Bhaskar's critical realism lies at the ontological root of contemporary streams of Marxist political and economic theory. The realist philosophy described by Bhaskar in \"A Realist Theory of Science\" is compatible with Marx's work in that it differentiates between an intransitive reality, which exists independently of human knowledge of it, and the socially produced world of science and empirical knowledge. This dualist logic is clearly present in the Marxian theory of ideology, according to which social reality may be very different from its empirically observable surface appearance. Notably, Alex Callinicos has argued for a 'critical realist' ontology in the philosophy of social science and explicitly acknowledges Bhaskar's influence (while also rejecting the latter's 'spiritualist turn' in his later work). The relationship between critical realist philosophy and Marxism has also been discussed in an article co-authored by Bhaskar and Callinicos and published in the \"Journal of Critical Realism\".\n\nSince 2000, critical realist philosophy has also been increasingly influential in the field of international relations (IR) theory. Patrick Thaddeus Jackson has called it 'all the rage' in the field. Bob Jessop, Colin Wight, Milja Kurki, Jonathan Joseph and Hidemi Suganami have all published major works on the utility of beginning IR research from a critical realist social ontology—an ontology they all credit Roy Bhaskar with originating.\n\nThe British ecological economist Clive Spash holds the opinion that critical realism offers a thorough basis—as a philosophy of science—for the theoretical foundation of ecological economics. He therefore uses a critical realist lens for conducting research in (ecological) economics.\n\nHowever, also other scholars base ecological economics on a critical realist foundation, such as Leigh Price from Rhodes University.\n\n\n\n"}

His poetry is characterized by a recognizable system of thought and poetic devices, bordering on philosophy, and, overall, it has a highly reflective tone. According to the critic Petar V. Arbutina, \"Stojanović belongs to the small and autochthonous circle of poets who have been the main creative and artistic force of the Serbian poetry in the last several decades.\"\nDejan Stojanović was born on 11 March 1959 in Peć, Autonomous District of Kosovo and Metohija, PR Serbia, FPR Yugoslavia. In 1972, he moved with his family to Sutomore, near Bar, Montenegro, where he completed his secondary education. He attended the University of Pristina at Kosovo. While he was predominantly interested in philosophy and the arts during his youth, he earned a degree in law.\n\nHe began to write poetry in the late seventies and kept his work private for three to four years, after which he published his poems in literary magazines in the former Yugoslavia. Serbian magazines in which his work was published include \"Stremljenja\" (English translation: \"Trends\") and \"Jedinstvo\" (English translation: \"Unity\") in Priština, and \"Gradina\" in Niš. By 1983, he became a member of a literary club (Karagač) in his hometown of Peć. During this time, he was named as the secretary and later promoted to president of the club. In this role, he conducted interviews with some local artists from Kosovo.\n\nIn his early adulthood, Stojanović developed a philosophical system of ideas that dealt primarily with metaphysical questions and the structure of the Universe. He wrote several hundred pages in his notebooks exploring these ideas, along with essays on language and literature. In 1999, these manuscripts, along with his library of more than a thousand books (carefully chosen for years), were lost due to fire shortly after the war in Kosovo ended. His books, along with his manuscripts, were held temporarily in his brother's office in the center of downtown Peć.\n\nIn 1990, Stojanović established a private publishing firm known as Metoh (English translation: the church's land). While the organization was located in Peć, the firm planned to publish a literary magazine in Kosovo. The firm's staff included writers from Belgrade, one of whom was Alek Vukadinović, a Serbian poet who supported Stojanović's plan to publish a magazine. While Stojanović's first book of poetry, \"Krugovanje\" (English translation: \"Circling\") was ready for publication in 1983, it was not published until 1993. During those ten years, several poems that were initially planned for inclusion in the book had been replaced by newer poems, which had been written between 1983 and 1986. The last poem in the book had actually been written in Chicago, in 1991.\n\nIn early 1990, Stojanović joined the writing staff of Serbian magazine, \"Pogledi\" (English translation: \"Viewpoints\"). At this time, he began a series of interviews with several Serbian writers in Belgrade, including Momo Kapor, Alek Vukadinović, and Nikola Milošević. During his second visit to Paris in May and June 1990, he interviewed Ljuba Popović, Petar Omčikus, Miloš Šobajić, and Jacques Claude Villard. In December 1990, he went to the US as a foreign correspondent, planning to stay six months to a year. During this time, he conducted interviews with prominent American writers, including Nobel Laureate Saul Bellow, Charles Simic, and Steve Tesich. He did not return to his homeland in summer 1991, when the Yugoslav Wars started in the former Yugoslavia, and has been living in Chicago since 1990. In honor of his series of interviews published in \"Conversations\", published in 1999 by Književna reč of Belgrade, Stojanović received the Rastko Petrović Award, presented by the Association of Writers of Serbia.\n\nStojanović’s poetry collections are characterized by sequences of compact, dense poems, simple yet complex in carefully organized overall structure, and that is why some more visibly than others appear as long poems. This is especially characteristic of the books, \"The Sign and its Children,\" \"The Shape\", and \"The Creator\" (\"Znak I njegova deca\", \"Oblik,\" \"Tvoritelj\" ), in which, with a relatively small number of words repeated in different contexts, Stojanović built his own poetic cosmogony. For that reason, writer and critic, David Kecman, described him as a \"cosmosophist.\"\n\nIn his poems, he covers the smallest and the largest topics with equal attention, often juxtaposing them to the level of paradox and absurdity, gradually building new perspectives and meanings that are not only poetic either in origin or in purpose. Some themes and preoccupations, be they stones or galaxies, are present in all of his books and it can be said that his poetry books are, in themselves, long poems and that all of them serve as ingredients of a hyper-poetry book that is still in the making.\n\nHe used many poetic forms never used before in Serbian poetry and also created some new forms. \"If elegance is represented by simplicity, then these are some of the most elegant verses imaginable,\" Branko Mikasinovich stated.\n\nThe majority of Stojanović's poems, initially written in Serbian and compiled into six volumes of poetry, have been translated into English and a selection of his poems has been translated into French.\n\n\n\n\n"}

Some writers have used it to refer to the hypothetical danger of future dystopian governments, which might resort to extreme or \"fascist\" policies to deal with environmental issues. Other writers have used it to refer to segments of historical fascist movements that focused on environmental issues.\n\nEnvironmental historian Michael E. Zimmerman defines \"ecofascism\" as \"a totalitarian government that requires individuals to sacrifice their interests to the well-being and glory of the 'land', understood as the splendid web of life, or the organic whole of nature, including peoples and their states\". Zimmerman argues that while no ecofascist government has so far existed, \"important aspects of it can be found in German National Socialism, one of whose central slogans was \"Blood and Soil\".\n\nAccording to environmentalist David Orton, the term is pejorative in nature and has \"social ecology roots, against the deep ecology movement and its supporters plus, more generally, the environmental movement. Thus, 'ecofascist' and 'ecofascism', are used not to enlighten but to smear.\"\n\nAccusations of ecofascism are common but usually strenuously denied. Such accusations have come from both those on the political left who see it as an assault on human rights, as in social ecologist Murray Bookchin's use of the term, and from those on the political right, as in Rush Limbaugh and other conservative and Wise Use Movement commentators. In the latter case, it is sometimes a hyperbolic use of the term that is applied to all environmental activists, including more mainstream groups such as Greenpeace and the Sierra Club.\n\nIn the former case, Bookchin criticizes the political position of deep ecologists such as David Foreman:\n\n\"There are barely disguised racists, survivalists, macho Daniel Boones, and outright social reactionaries who use the word ecology to express their views, just as there are deeply concerned naturalists, communitarians, social radicals, and feminists who use the word ecology to express theirs... It was out of this former kind of crude eco-brutalism that Hitler, in the name of 'population control,' with a racial orientation, fashioned theories of blood and soil... The same eco-brutalism now reappears a half-century later among self-professed deep ecologists who believe that Third World peoples should be permitted to starve to death and that desperate Indian immigrants from Latin America should be excluded by the border cops from the United States lest they burden 'our' ecological resources.\"\n\nSuch observations among the left are not exclusive to Bookchin. In his review of Anna Bramwell's biography of Richard Walther Darré, J. Sakai observes the fascist ideological undertones of natural purity. Prior to the Russian Revolution, the tsarist intelligentsia was divided on the one hand between liberal \"utilitarian naturalists\", who were \"taken with the idea of creating a paradise on earth through scientific mastery of nature\" and influenced by nihilism as well as Russian zoologists such as Anatoli Petrovich Bogdanov, and \"cultural-aesthetic\" conservationists such as Ivan Parfenevich Borodin, who were influenced in turn by German Romantic and idealist concepts such as \"Landschaftspflege\" and \"Naturdenkmal\".\n\nThe influential European \"Nouvelle Droite\" movement, developed by Alain de Benoist and other individuals involved with the GRECE think tank, have also combined green politics with right-wing ideas, such as European ethnonationalism.\n\n\n"}

The ratio of one's speed to that of sound is named the Mach number in his honor. As a philosopher of science, he was a major influence on logical positivism and American pragmatism. Through his criticism of Newton's theories of space and time, he foreshadowed Einstein's theory of relativity.\n\nErnst Waldfried Josef Wenzel Mach was born in Chrlice (), Moravia (then in the Austrian empire, now part of Brno in the Czech Republic). His father, who had graduated from Charles University in Prague, acted as tutor to the noble Brethon family in Zlín in eastern Moravia. His grandfather, Wenzl Lanhaus, an administrator of the Chirlitz estate, was also master builder of the streets there. His activities in that field later influenced the theoretical work of Ernst Mach. Some sources give Mach's birthplace as Tuřany (, now also part of Brno), the site of the Chirlitz registry-office. It was there that Ernst Mach was baptized by Peregrin Weiss. Mach later became a socialist and an atheist. His theory and life, though, was sometimes compared with Buddhism, namely by Heinrich Gomperz who addressed Mach as the \"Buddha of Science\" due to the phenomenalist approach of the \"Ego\" in his \"Analysis of Sensations\".\n\nUp to the age of 14, Mach received his education at home from his parents. He then entered a Gymnasium in Kroměříž (), where he studied for three years. In 1855 he became a student at the University of Vienna. There he studied physics and for one semester medical physiology, receiving his doctorate in physics in 1860 under Andreas von Ettingshausen with a thesis titled \"Über elektrische Ladungen und Induktion\", and his habilitation the following year. His early work focused on the Doppler effect in optics and acoustics. In 1864 he took a job as Professor of Mathematics at the University of Graz, having turned down the position of a chair in surgery at the University of Salzburg to do so, and in 1866 he was appointed as Professor of Physics. During that period, Mach continued his work in psycho-physics and in sensory perception. In 1867, he took the chair of Experimental Physics at the Charles University, Prague, where he stayed for 28 years before returning to Vienna.\n\nMach's main contribution to physics involved his description and photographs of spark shock-waves and then ballistic shock-waves. He described how when a bullet or shell moved faster than the speed of sound, it created a compression of air in front of it. Using schlieren photography, he and his son Ludwig were able to photograph the shadows of the invisible shock waves. During the early 1890s Ludwig was able to invent an interferometer which allowed for much clearer photographs. But Mach also made many contributions to psychology and physiology, including his anticipation of gestalt phenomena, his discovery of the oblique effect and of Mach bands, an inhibition-influenced type of visual illusion, and especially his discovery of a non-acoustic function of the inner ear which helps control human balance.\n\nOne of the best-known of Mach's ideas is the so-called \"Mach principle,\" concerning the physical origin of inertia. This was never written down by Mach, but was given a graphic verbal form, attributed by Philipp Frank to Mach himself, as, \"When the subway jerks, it's the fixed stars that throw you down.\"\n\nMach also became well known for his philosophy developed in close interplay with his science. Mach defended a type of phenomenalism recognizing only sensations as real. This position seemed incompatible with the view of atoms and molecules as external, mind-independent things. He famously declared, after an 1897 lecture by Ludwig Boltzmann at the Imperial Academy of Science in Vienna: \"I don't believe that atoms exist!\" From about 1908 to 1911 Mach's reluctance to acknowledge the reality of atoms was criticized by Max Planck as being incompatible with physics. Einstein's 1905 demonstration that the statistical fluctuations of atoms allowed measurement of their existence without direct individuated sensory evidence marked a turning point in the acceptance of atomic theory. Some of Mach's criticisms of Newton's position on space and time influenced Einstein, but later Einstein realized that Mach was basically opposed to Newton's philosophy and concluded that his physical criticism was not sound.\n\nIn 1898 Mach suffered from cardiac arrest and in 1901 retired from the University of Vienna and was appointed to the upper chamber of the Austrian parliament. On leaving Vienna in 1913 he moved to his son's home in Vaterstetten, near Munich, where he continued writing and corresponding until his death in 1916, only one day after his 78th birthday.\n\nMost of Mach's initial studies in the field of experimental physics concentrated on the interference, diffraction, polarization and refraction of light in different media under external influences. From there followed important explorations in the field of supersonic fluid mechanics. Mach and physicist-photographer Peter Salcher presented their paper on this subject in 1887; it correctly describes the sound effects observed during the supersonic motion of a projectile. They deduced and experimentally confirmed the existence of a shock wave of conical shape, with the projectile at the apex. The ratio of the speed of a fluid to the local speed of sound \"v\"/\"v\" is now called the Mach number. It is a critical parameter in the description of high-speed fluid movement in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics. Mach also contributed to cosmology the hypothesis known as Mach's principle.\n\nFrom 1895 to 1901, Mach held a newly created chair for \"the history and philosophy of the inductive sciences\" at the University of Vienna. In his historico-philosophical studies, Mach developed a phenomenalistic philosophy of science which became influential in the 19th and 20th centuries. He originally saw scientific laws as summaries of experimental events, constructed for the purpose of making complex data comprehensible, but later emphasized mathematical functions as a more useful way to describe sensory appearances. Thus scientific laws while somewhat idealized have more to do with describing sensations than with reality as it exists beyond sensations.\n\nMach's positivism also influenced many Russian Marxists, such as Alexander Bogdanov (1873–1928). In 1908, Lenin wrote a philosophical work, \"Materialism and Empirio-criticism\" (published 1909), in which he criticized Machism and the views of \"Russian Machists\" (Lenin also cited in this work the concept of the 'Ether', as the medium through which light waves propagated, and the concept of time as an absolute). Empirio-criticism is the term for the rigorously positivist and radically empirical philosophy established by the German philosopher Richard Avenarius and further developed by Mach, which claims that all we can know is our sensations and that knowledge should be confined to pure experience.\n\nIn accordance with empirio-critical philosophy, Mach opposed Ludwig Boltzmann and others who proposed an atomic theory of physics. Since one cannot observe things as small as atoms directly, and since no atomic model at the time was consistent, the atomic hypothesis seemed to Mach to be unwarranted, and perhaps not sufficiently \"economical\". Mach had a direct influence on the Vienna Circle philosophers and the school of logical positivism in general.\n\nTo Mach are attributed a number of principles that distill his ideal of physical theorisation—what is now called \"Machian physics\":\n\nThe last is singled out, particularly by Albert Einstein, as \"the\" Mach's principle. Einstein cited it as one of the three principles underlying general relativity. In 1930, he stated that \"it is justified to consider Mach as the precursor of the general theory of relativity\", though Mach, before his death, would apparently reject Einstein's theory. Einstein was aware that his theories did not fulfill all Mach's principles, and no subsequent theory has either, despite considerable effort.\n\nAccording to Alexander Riegler, Ernst Mach's work was a precursor to the influential perspective known as constructivism. Constructivism holds that all knowledge is constructed rather than received by the learner. He took an exceptionally non-dualist, phenomenological position. The founder of radical constructivism, von Glasersfeld, gave a nod to Mach as an ally.\n\nIn 1873, independently of each other Mach and the physiologist and physician Josef Breuer discovered how the sense of balance (i.e., the perception of the head’s imbalance) functions, tracing its management by information which the brain receives from the movement of a fluid in the semicircular canals of the inner ear. That the sense of balance depended on the three semicircular canals was discovered in 1870 by the physiologist Friedrich Goltz, but Goltz did not discover how the balance-sensing apparatus functioned. Mach devised a swivel chair to enable him to test his theories, and Floyd Ratliff has suggested that this experiment may have paved the way to Mach's critique of a physical conception of absolute space and motion.\n\nIn the area of sensory perception, psychologists remember Mach for the optical illusion called Mach bands. The effect exaggerates the contrast between edges of the slightly differing shades of gray, as soon as they contact one another, by triggering edge-detection in the human visual system.\n\nMore clearly than anyone before or since Mach made the distinction between what he called \"physiological\" (specifically visual) and \"geometrical\" spaces.\n\nMach's views on mediating structures inspired B. F. Skinner's strongly inductive position, which paralleled Mach's in the field of psychology.\n\nIn homage his name was given to:\n\n\n\n\n"}

While the term was first used in 1995 in Richard Gomulkiewicz and Robert Holt's essay in the journal \"Evolution\", the theory has since academically matured through review and modeling. The most commonly used meaning of the term was established in Gonzalez et al. (2012), which states that evolutionary rescue \"occurs when genetic adaptation allows a population to recover from demographic effects initiated by environmental change that would otherwise cause extirpation\".\n\nDue to rapid losses of biodiversity, climate change, and rapid spread of non-native species due to globalization, natural environments are changing faster now than in any other time point in human history. Given that traditional framework of evolution emphasizes that ecologically relevant evolution occurs slowly for the plant and animal kingdoms, the 20th century and 21st century shift in the rate of environmental change naturally raises questions of contemporary evolution. The central question in the framework of evolutionary rescue remains, \"If contemporary evolution, also referred to as rapid evolution, occurs, can it be fast enough to foster population persistence in extremely small time-scales?\". Proponents of the evolutionary rescue hypothesis argue that evolutionary rescue is a unique phenomenon, separate from two commonly studied escapes from ecological pressures, demographic and genetic rescues. While dispersal is a key aspect to all three population survival strategies, evolutionary rescue is the only one driven by adaptive evolution mechanistically. Demographic rescue is simply a dynamic driven by source-sink immigration dynamics, whereas genetic rescue is primarily driven by hybridization in combination with immigration. Given the reliance on immigration, it can be difficult to disentangle demographic rescue from genetic rescue. The distinction between these three rescue strategies may be difficult to prove, if it exists, although rescue from negative population growth may be a hallmark.\n\nIt may be easier to find quantifiable evidence for evolutionary rescue in rapidly shifting environments versus gradually shifting environments (climate change, ocean acidification, etc.). High localization and source-sink biogeographic demographic dynamics may also increase the likelihood of evolutionary rescue. Evolutionary rescue may also be highly characterized by a U-shaped curve, in which the population declines sharply until it passes a stochastic threshold, at which the adaptive allele frequency rapidly increases, with the population rebounding at a slower rate as well. The most vulnerable part of the evolutionary rescue process, theoretically, should be the time point during which the population is beyond the stochastic threshold, which exposes the population to random outcomes not determined by genetic or evolutionary mechanisms.\n\nWhile there is empirical evidence for evolutionary rescue, it is important to note that missing temporal, demographic or allelic data makes the majority of these examples suggestive of evolutionary rescue at best. For example, the demographic shifts in \"Gasterosteus aculeatus\" from weakly armored to heavily armored variants following bioremediation of water clarity in Lake Washington, USA, suggest that increased the predatory efficiency of \"Oncorhynchus clarkii\", although inclusion versus exclusion treatments at controlled densities would provide stronger mechanistic support. Another possible example of evolutionary rescue in nature is the selective response of redbellied black snakes (\"Pseudechis porphyriacus\") to cane toads (\"Rhinella marina\") in Australia, in which \"P. porphyriacus\" exposed to \"R. marina\" for long periods of time demonstrated rapid adaptive shifts in resistance.\n\nAt the point in time, more substantial theoretical, modeling and empirical work is needed to distinguish evolutionary rescue from traditionally adaptation discourse in the evolutionary biology field. Currently, one of the key arguments separating evolutionary rescue from adaptation is the reliance on absolutely fitness versus relative fitness. While the theory of evolutionary rescue may help inform future conservation efforts, more work is needed to explain the role of the interplay between dispersal and negative density dependence on an organism's short-term and long-term capacity for adaptation and evolutionary rescue. Furthermore, more in-depth work on the role of stochastic fluctuations, particularly in the determination of stochastic thresholds, is needed to establish evolutionary rescue as a viable explanation for trends in evolutionary biology.\n\n"}

Till the age of 15, he studied Hebrew literature exclusively. At an early age he showed signs of great intellectual power, and was hailed as a genius. In the house of his father-in-law, I. Mieses, a scholar living in Dresden, he met, besides Solomon Judah Loeb Rapoport and other Maskilim, his future teacher, M. Sehongut, who initiated him into the study of philosophy, and with whom he used to converse in Hebrew during their regular daily walks. At the same time, he assiduously applied himself to the study of German, French, Italian, Latin, mathematics, and astronomy. In 1846, his German essay \"Gegenwart und Vergangeuheit im Judenthume\" appeared in Julius Fürst's \"Der Orient\"; and from that time, he became assistant editor of and a regular contributor to that paper. In 1878, he published (at Lyck) a didactic poem entitled \"HaEmunah weha-Tebunah,\" treating of Darwinism and its opponents. By this production, he gained for himself a prominent and lasting place among Hebrew poets. Mieses was a prolific writer. Besides frequently contributing to various Hebrew and German periodicals, he wrote the following independent works: \"Ha-Kabbalah weha-Hasidut\" (Breslau, 1866; Odessa, 1871); \"Korot ha-Filusufiyah ha-Hadashah\" (Leipsic, 1887), a history of modern philosophy from Kant to Mieses' own time; \"Shirim\" (Cracow, 1891), a collection of miscellaneous poems; \"Die Bibel der Vernunft\" (Leipsic, 1895).

{"id": "6459796", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6459796", "title": "History of philosophy in Poland", "text": "History of philosophy in Poland\n\nThe history of philosophy in Poland parallels the evolution of philosophy in Europe in general. \n\nPolish philosophy drew upon the broader currents of European philosophy, and in turn contributed to their growth. Among the most momentous Polish contributions were made, in the thirteenth century, by the Scholastic philosopher and scientist Witelo, and, in the sixteenth century, by the Renaissance polymath Nicolaus Copernicus.\n\nSubsequently, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth partook in the intellectual ferment of the Enlightenment, which for the multi-ethnic Commonwealth ended not long after the partitions and political annihilation that would last for the next 123 years, until the collapse of the three partitioning empires in World War I.\n\nThe period of Messianism, between the November 1830 and January 1863 Uprisings, reflected European Romantic and Idealist trends, as well as a Polish yearning for political resurrection. It was a period of maximalist metaphysical systems.\n\nThe collapse of the January 1863 Uprising prompted an agonizing reappraisal of Poland's situation. Poles gave up their earlier practice of \"measuring their resources by their aspirations,\" and buckled down to hard work and study. \"[A] Positivist,\" wrote the novelist Bolesław Prus' friend, Julian Ochorowicz, was \"anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible.\"\n\nThe twentieth century brought a new quickening to Polish philosophy. There was growing interest in western philosophical currents. Rigorously trained Polish philosophers made substantial contributions to specialized fields—to psychology, the history of philosophy, the theory of knowledge, and especially mathematical logic. Jan Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of many-valued logic and his \"Polish notation.\" Alfred Tarski's work in truth theory won him world renown.\n\nAfter World War II, for over four decades, world-class Polish philosophers and historians of philosophy such as Władysław Tatarkiewicz continued their work, often in the face of adversities occasioned by the dominance of a politically enforced official philosophy.\nThe phenomenologist Roman Ingarden did influential work in esthetics and in a Husserl-style metaphysics; his student Karol Wojtyła acquired a unique influence on the world stage as Pope John Paul II.\n\nThe formal history of philosophy in Poland may be said to have begun in the fifteenth century, following the revival of the University of Kraków by King Władysław II Jagiełło in 1400.\n\nThe true beginnings of Polish philosophy, however, reach back to the thirteenth century and Witelo (c. 1230 – c. 1314), a Silesian born to a Polish mother and a Thuringian settler, a contemporary of Thomas Aquinas who had spent part of his life in Italy at centers of the highest intellectual culture. In addition to being a philosopher, he was a scientist who specialized in optics. His famous treatise, \"Perspectiva\", while drawing on the Arabic \"Book of Optics\" by Alhazen, was unique in Latin literature, and in turn helped inspire Roger Bacon's best work, Part V of his \"Opus maius\", \"On Perspectival Science,\" as well as his supplementary treatise \"On the Multiplication of Vision\". Witelo's \"Perspectiva\" additionally made important contributions to psychology: it held that vision \"per se\" apprehends only colors and light while all else, particularly the distance and size of objects, is established by means of association and unconscious deduction.\n\nWitelo's concept of being was one rare in the Middle Ages, neither Augustinian as among conservatives nor Aristotelian as among progressives, but Neoplatonist. It was an emanationist concept that held radiation to be the prime characteristic of being, and ascribed to radiation the nature of light. This \"metaphysic of light\" inclined Witelo to optical research, or perhaps \"vice versa\" his optical studies led to his metaphysic.\n\nAccording to the Polish historian of philosophy, Władysław Tatarkiewicz, no Polish philosopher since Witelo has enjoyed so eminent a European standing as this thinker who belonged, in a sense, to the prehistory of Polish philosophy.\n\nFrom the beginning of the fifteenth century, Polish philosophy, centered at Kraków University, pursued a normal course. It no longer harbored exceptional thinkers such as Witelo, but it did feature representatives of all wings of mature Scholasticism, \"via antiqua\" as well as \"via moderna\".\n\nThe first of these to reach Kraków was \"via moderna\", then the more widespread movement in Europe. In physics, logic and ethics, Terminism (Nominalism) prevailed in Kraków, under the influence of the French Scholastic, Jean Buridan (died c. 1359), who had been rector of the University of Paris and an exponent of views of William of Ockham. Buridan had formulated the theory of \"impetus\"—the force that causes a body, once set in motion, to persist in motion—and stated that impetus is proportional to the speed of, and amount of matter comprising, a body: Buridan thus anticipated Galileo and Isaac Newton. His theory of impetus was momentous in that it also explained the motions of celestial bodies without resort to the spirits—\"intelligentiae\"—to which the Peripatetics (followers of Aristotle) had ascribed those motions. At Kraków, physics was now expounded by (St.) Jan Kanty (1390–1473), who developed this concept of \"impetus.\"\n\nA general trait of the Kraków Scholastics was a provlivity for compromise—for reconciling Nominalism with the older tradition. For example, the Nominalist, Benedict Hesse, while in principle accepting the theory of impetus, did not apply it to the heavenly spheres.\n\nIn the second half of the fifteenth century, at Kraków, \"via antiqua\" became dominant. Nominalism retreated, and the old Scholasticism triumphed.\n\nIn this period, Thomism had its chief center at Cologne, whence it influenced Kraków. Cologne, formerly the home ground of Albertus Magnus, had preserved Albert's mode of thinking. Thus the Cologne philosophers formed two wings, the Thomist and Albertist, and even Cologne's Thomists showed Neoplatonist traits characteristic of Albert, affirming emanation, a hierarchy of being, and a metaphysic of light.\n\nThe chief Kraków adherents of the Cologne-style Thomism included Jan of Głogów (c. 1445 – 1507) and Jakub of Gostynin (c. 1454 – 1506). Another, purer teacher of Thomism was Michał Falkener of Wrocław (c. 1450 – 1534).\n\nAlmost at the same time, Scotism appeared in Poland, having been brought from Paris first by Michał Twaróg of Bystrzyków (c. 1450 – 1520). Twaróg had studied at Paris in 1473–77, in the period when, following the anathematization of the Nominalists (1473), the Scotist school was there enjoying its greatest triumphs. A prominent student of Twaróg's, Jan of Stobnica (c. 1470 – 1519), was already a moderate Scotist who took account of the theories of the Ockhamists, Thomists and Humanists.\n\nWhen Nominalism was revived in western Europe at the turn of the sixteenth century, particularly thanks to Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (\"Faber Stapulensis\"), it presently reappeared in Kraków and began taking the upper hand there once more over Thomism and Scotism. It was reintroduced particularly by Lefèvre's pupil, Jan Szylling, a native of Kraków who had studied at Paris in the opening years of the sixteenth century. Another follower of Lefèvre's was Grzegorz of Stawiszyn, a Kraków professor who, beginning in 1510, published the Frenchman's works at Kraków.\n\nThus Poland had made her appearance as a separate philosophical center only at the turn of the fifteenth century, at a time when the creative period of Scholastic philosophy had already passed. Throughout the fifteenth century, Poland harbored all the currents of Scholasticism. The advent of Humanism in Poland would find a Scholasticism more vigorous than in other countries. Indeed, Scholasticism would survive the 16th and 17th centuries and even part of the 18th at Kraków and Wilno Universities and at numerous Jesuit, Dominican and Franciscan colleges.\n\nTo be sure, in the sixteenth century, with the arrival of the Renaissance, Scholasticism would enter upon a decline; but during the 17th century's Counter-reformation, and even into the early 18th century, Scholasticism would again become Poland's chief philosophy.\n\nThe spirit of Humanism, which had reached Poland by the middle of the fifteenth century, was not very \"philosophical.\" Rather, it lent its stimulus to linguistic studies, political thought, and scientific research. But these manifested a philosophical attitude different from that of the previous period.\n\nEmpirical natural science had flourished at Kraków as early as the fifteenth century, side by side with speculative philosophy. The most perfect product of this blossoming was Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543, ). He was not only a scientist but a philosopher. According to Tatarkiewicz, he may have been the greatest—in any case, the most renowned—philosopher that Poland ever produced. He drew the inspiration for his cardinal discovery from philosophy; he had become acquainted through Marsilio Ficino with the philosophies of Plato and the Pythagoreans; and through the writings of the philosophers Cicero and Plutarch he had learned about the ancients who had declared themselves in favor of the Earth's movement.\n\nCopernicus may also have been influenced by Kraków philosophy: during his studies there, Terminist physics had been taught, with special emphasis on \"\"impetus\".\" His own thinking was guided by philosophical considerations. He arrived at the heliocentric thesis (as he was to write in a youthful treatise) \"ratione postea equidem sensu\": it was not observation but the discovery of a logical contradiction in Ptolemy's system, that served him as a point of departure that led to the new astronomy. In his dedication to Pope Paul III, he submitted his work for judgment by \"philosophers.\"\n\nIn its turn, Copernicus' theory transformed man's view of the structure of the universe, and of the place held in it by the earth and by man, and thus attained a far-reaching philosophical importance.\n\nCopernicus was involved not only in natural science and natural philosophy but also—by his postulation of a quantity theory of money and of \"Gresham's Law\" (in the year, 1519, of Thomas Gresham's birth)—in the philosophy of man.\n\nIn the early sixteenth century, Plato, who had become a model for philosophy in Italy, especially in Medicean Florence, was represented in Poland in some ways by Adam of Łowicz, author of \"Conversations about Immortality\".\n\nGenerally speaking, though, Poland remained Aristotelian. Sebastian Petrycy of Pilzno (1554–1626) laid stress, in the theory of knowledge, on experiment and induction; and in psychology, on feeling and will; while in politics he preached democratic ideas. Petrycy's central feature was his linking of philosophical theory with the requirements of practical national life. In 1601–18, a period when translations into modern languages were still rarities, he accomplished Polish translations of Aristotle's practical works. With Petrycy, vernacular Polish philosophical terminology began to develop not much later than did the French and German.\n\nYet another Renaissance current, the new Stoicism, was represented in Poland by Jakub Górski (c. 1525 – 1585), author of a famous \"Dialectic\" (1563) and of many works in grammar, rhetoric, theology and sociology. He tended toward eclecticism, attempting to reconcile the Stoics with Aristotle.\n\nA later, purer representative of Stoicism in Poland was Adam Burski (c. 1560 – 1611), author of a \"Dialectica Ciceronis\" (1604) boldly proclaiming Stoic sensualism and empiricism and—before Francis Bacon—urging the use of inductive method.\n\nA star among the pleiade of progressive political philosophers during the Polish Renaissance was Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski (1503–72), who advocated on behalf of equality for all before the law, the accountability of monarch and government to the nation, and social assistance for the weak and disadvantaged. His chief work was \"De Republica emendanda\" (On Reform of the Republic, 1551–54).\n\nAnother notable political thinker was Wawrzyniec Grzymała Goślicki (1530–1607), best known in Poland and abroad for his book \"De optimo senatore\" (The Accomplished Senator, 1568). It propounded the view—which for long got the book banned in England, as subversive of monarchy—that a ruler may legitimately govern only with the sufferance of the people.\n\nAfter the first decades of the 17th century, the wars, invasions and internal dissensions that beset the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, brought a decline in philosophy. If in the ensuing period there was independent philosophical thought, it was among the religious dissenters, particularly the Polish Arians, also known variously as Antitrinitarians, Socinians, and Polish Brethren—forerunners of the British and American Socinians, Unitarians and Deists who were to figure prominently in the intellectual and political currents of the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nThe Polish dissenters created an original ethical theory radically condemning evil and violence. Centers of intellectual life such as that at Leszno hosted notable thinkers such as the Czech pedagogue, Jan Amos Komensky (Comenius), and the Pole, Jan Jonston. Jonston was tutor and physician to the Leszczyński family, a devotee of Bacon and experimental knowledge, and author of \"Naturae constantia\", published in Amsterdam in 1632, whose geometrical method and naturalistic, almost pantheistic concept of the world may have influenced Benedict Spinoza.\n\nThe Leszczyński family itself would produce an 18th-century Polish-Lithuanian king, Stanisław Leszczyński (1677–1766; reigned in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth 1704–11 and again 1733–36), \"le philosophe bienfaisant\" (\"the beneficent philosopher\")—in fact, an independent thinker whose views on culture were in advance of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's, and who was the first to introduce into Polish intellectual life on a large scale the French influences that were later to become so strong.\n\nIn 1689, in an exceptional miscarriage of justice, a Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher, Kazimierz Łyszczyński, author of a manuscript treatise, \"De non existentia Dei\" (On the Non-existence of God), was accused of atheism by a priest who was his debtor, was convicted, and was executed in most brutal fashion.\n\n \n\nAfter a decline of a century and a half, in the mid-18th century, Polish philosophy began to revive. The hub of this movement was Warsaw. While Poland's capital then had no institution of higher learning, neither were those of Kraków, Zamość or Wilno any longer agencies of progress. The initial impetus for the revival came from religious thinkers: from members of the Piarist and other teaching orders. A leading patron of the new ideas was Bishop Andrzej Stanisław Załuski.\n\nScholasticism, which until then had dominated Polish philosophy, was followed by the Enlightenment. Initially the major influence was Christian Wolff and, indirectly, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's elected king, August III the Saxon, and the relations between Poland and her neighbor, Saxony, heightened the German influence. Wolff's doctrine was brought to Warsaw in 1740 by the Theatine, Portalupi; from 1743, its chief Polish champion was Wawrzyniec Mitzler de Kolof (1711–78), court physician to August III.\n\nUnder the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski (reigned 1764–95), the Polish Enlightenment was radicalized and came under French influence. The philosophical foundation of the movement ceased to be the Rationalist doctrine of Wolff and became the Sensualism of Condillac. This spirit pervaded Poland's Commission of National Education, which completed the reforms begun by the Piarist priest, Stanisław Konarski. The Commission's members were in touch with the French Encyclopedists and freethinkers, with d'Alembert and Condorcet, Condillac and Rousseau. The Commission abolished school instruction in theology, even in philosophy.\n\nThis empiricist and positivist Enlightenment philosophy produced several outstanding Polish thinkers. Though active in the reign of Stanisław August Poniatowski, they published their chief works only after the loss of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's independence in 1795. The most important of these figures were Jan Śniadecki, Stanisław Staszic and Hugo Kołłątaj.\n\nAnother adherent of this empirical Enlightenment philosophy was the minister of education under the Duchy of Warsaw and under the Congress Poland established by the Congress of Vienna, Stanisław Kostka Potocki (1755–1821). In some places, as at Krzemieniec and its Lyceum in southeastern Poland, this philosophy was to survive well into the nineteenth century. Though a belated philosophy from a western perspective, it was at the same time the philosophy of the future. This was the period between d'Alembert and Comte; and even as this variety of positivism was temporarily fading in the West, it was carrying on in Poland.\n\nAt the turn of the nineteenth century, as Immanuel Kant's fame was spreading over the rest of Europe, in Poland the Enlightenment philosophy was still in full flower. Kantism found here a hostile soil. Even before Kant had been understood, he was condemned by the most respected writers of the time: by Jan Śniadecki, Staszic, Kołłątaj, Tadeusz Czacki, later by Anioł Dowgird (1776–1835). Jan Śniadecki warned against this \"fanatical, dark and apocalyptic mind,\" and wrote: \"To revise Locke and Condillac, to desire \"a priori\" knowledge of things that human nature can grasp only by their consequences, is a lamentable aberration of mind.\"\n\nJan Śniadecki's younger brother, however, Jędrzej Śniadecki, was the first respected Polish scholar to declare (1799) for Kant. And in applying Kantian ideas to the natural sciences, he did something new that would not be undertaken until much later by Johannes Müller, Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz and other famous scientists of the nineteenth century.\n\nAnother Polish proponent of Kantism was Józef Kalasanty Szaniawski (1764–1843), who had been a student of Kant's at Königsberg. But, having accepted the fundamental points of the critical theory of knowledge, he still hesitated between Kant's metaphysical agnosticism and the new metaphysics of Idealism. Thus this one man introduced to Poland both the antimetaphysical Kant and the post-Kantian metaphysics.\n\nIn time, Kant's foremost Polish sympathizer would be Feliks Jaroński (1777–1827), who lectured at Kraków in 1809–18. Still, his Kantian sympathies were only partial. And this half-heartedness was typical of Polish Kantism generally. In Poland there was no actual Kantian period.\n\nFor a generation, between the age of the French Enlightenment and that of the Polish national metaphysic, the Scottish philosophy of common sense became the dominant outlook in Poland. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Scottish School of Common Sense held sway in most European countries—in Britain till mid-century, and nearly as long in France. But in Poland, from the first, the Scottish philosophy fused with Kantism, in this regard anticipating the West.\n\nThe Kantian and Scottish ideas were united in typical fashion by Jędrzej Śniadecki (1768–1838). The younger brother of Jan Śniadecki, Jędrzej was an illustrious scientist, biologist and physician, and the more creative mind of the two. He had been educated at the universities of Kraków, Padua and Edinburgh and was from 1796 a professor at Wilno, where he held a chair of chemistry and pharmacy. He was a foe of metaphysics, holding that the fathoming of first causes of being was \"impossible to fulfill and unnecessary.\" But foe of metaphysics that he was, he was not an Empiricist—and this was his link with Kant. \"Experiment and observation can only gather... the materials from which common sense alone can build science.\"\n\nAn analogous position, shunning both positivism and metaphysical speculation, affined to the Scots but linked in some features to Kantian critique, was held in the period before the November 1830 Uprising by virtually all the university professors in Poland: in Wilno, by Dowgird; in Kraków, by Józef Emanuel Jankowski (1790–1847); and in Warsaw, by Adam Ignacy Zabellewicz (1784–1831) and Krystyn Lach Szyrma (1791–1866).\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, following a generation imbued with Enlightenment ideas, Poland passed directly to a maximalist philosophical program, to absolute metaphysics, to syntheses, to great systems, to reform of the world through philosophy; and broke with positivism, the doctrines of the Enlightenment, and the precepts of the Scottish School of Common Sense.\n\nThe Polish metaphysical blossoming occurred between the November 1830 and January 1863 Uprisings, and stemmed from the spiritual aspirations of a politically humiliated people.\n\nThe Poles' metaphysic, though drawing on German Idealism, differed considerably from it; it was Spiritualist rather than Idealist. It was characterized by a theistic belief in a personal God, in the immortality of souls, and in the superiority of spiritual over corporeal forces.\n\nThe Polish metaphysic saw the mission of philosophy not only in the search for truth, but in the reformation of life and in the salvation of mankind. It was permeated with a faith in the metaphysical import of the nation and convinced that man could fulfill his vocation only within the communion of spirits that was the nation, that nations determined the evolution of mankind, and more particularly that the Polish nation had been assigned the role of Messiah to the nations.\n\nThese three traits—the founding of a metaphysic on the concept of the soul and on the concept of the nation, and the assignment to the latter of reformative-soteriological tasks—distinguished the Polish metaphysicians. Some, such as Hoene-Wroński, saw the Messiah in philosophy itself; others, such as the poet Mickiewicz, saw Him in the Polish nation. Hence Hoene-Wroński, and later Mickiewicz, adopted for their doctrines the name, \"Messianism\". It came to apply generically to Polish metaphysics of the nineteenth century, much as the term \"Idealism\" does to German metaphysics.\n\nIn the first half of the nineteenth century there appeared in Poland a host of metaphysicians unanimous as to these basic precepts, if strikingly at variance as to details. Their only center was Paris, which hosted Józef Maria Hoene-Wroński (1778–1853). Otherwise they lived in isolation: Bronisław Trentowski (1808–69) in Germany; Józef Gołuchowski (1797–1858) in Congress Poland; August Cieszkowski (1814–94) and Karol Libelt (1807–75) in Wielkopolska (western Poland); Józef Kremer (1806–75) in Kraków. Most of them became active only after the November 1830 Uprising.\n\nAn important role in the Messianist movement was also played by the Polish Romantic poets, Adam Mickiewicz (1798–1855), Juliusz Słowacki (1809–49) and Zygmunt Krasiński (1812–59), as well as by religious activists such as Andrzej Towiański (1799–1878).\n\nBetween the philosophers and the poets, the method of reasoning, and often the results, differed. The poets desired to create a specifically \"Polish\" philosophy, the philosophers—an absolute \"universal\" philosophy. The Messianist philosophers knew contemporary European philosophy and drew from it; the poets created more of a home-grown metaphysic.\n\nThe most important difference among the Messianists was that some were rationalists, others—mystics. Wroński's philosophy was no less rationalist than Hegel's, while the poets voiced a mystical philosophy.\n\nThe Messianists were not the only Polish philosophers active in the period between the 1830 and 1863 uprisings. Much more widely known in Poland were Catholic thinkers such as Father Piotr Semenenko (1814–86), Florian Bochwic (1779–1856) and Eleonora Ziemięcka (1819–69), Poland's first woman philosopher. The Catholic philosophy of the period was more widespread and fervent than profound or creative.\n\nAlso active were pure Hegelians such as Tytus Szczeniowski (1808–80) and leftist Hegelians such as Edward Dembowski (1822–46).\n\nAn outstanding representative of the philosophy of Common Sense, Michał Wiszniewski (1794–1865), had studied at that Enlightenment bastion, Krzemieniec; in 1820, in France, he had attended the lectures of Victor Cousin; and in 1821, in Britain, he had met the head of the Scottish School of Common Sense at the time, Dugald Stewart.\n\nActive as well were precursors of Positivism such as Józef Supiński (1804–93) and Dominik Szulc (1797–1860)—links between the earlier Enlightenment age of the brothers Śniadecki and the coming age of Positivism.\n\nThe Positivist philosophy that took form in Poland after the January 1863 Uprising was hardly identical with the philosophy of Auguste Comte. It was in fact a return to the line of Jan Śniadecki and Hugo Kołłątaj—a line that had remained unbroken even during the Messianist period—now enriched with the ideas of Comte. However, it belonged only partly to philosophy. It combined Comte's ideas with those of John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer, for it was interested in what was common to them all: a sober, empirical attitude to life.\n\nThe Polish Positivism was a reaction against philosophical speculation, but also against romanticism in poetry and idealism in politics. It was less a scholarly movement than literary, political and social. Few original books were published, but many were translated from the philosophical literature of the West—not Comte himself, but easier writers: Hippolyte Taine, Mill, Spencer, Alexander Bain, Thomas Henry Huxley, the Germans Wilhelm Wundt and Friedrich Albert Lange, the Danish philosopher Höffding.\n\nThe disastrous outcome of the January 1863 Uprising had produced a distrust of romanticism, an aversion to ideals and illusions, and turned the search for redemption toward sober thought and work directed at realistic goals. The watchword became \"organic work\"—a term for the campaign for economic improvement, which was regarded as a prime requisite for progress. Poles prepared for such work by studying the natural sciences and economics: they absorbed Charles Darwin's biological theories, Mill's economic theories, Henry Thomas Buckle's deterministic theory of civilization. At length they became aware of the connection between their own convictions and aims and the Positivist philosophy of Auguste Comte, and borrowed its name and watchwords.\n\nThis movement, which had begun still earlier in Austrian-ruled Galicia, became concentrated with time in the Russian-ruled Congress Poland centered about Warsaw and is therefore commonly known as the \"Warsaw Positivism.\" Its chief venue was the Warsaw \"Przegląd Tygodniowy\" (Weekly Review); Warsaw University (the \"Main School\") had been closed by the Russians in 1869.\n\nThe pioneers of the Warsaw Positivism were natural scientists and physicians rather than philosophers, and still more so journalists and men of letters: Aleksander Świętochowski (1849–1938), Piotr Chmielowski (1848–1904), Adolf Dygasiński (1839–1902), Bolesław Prus (1847–1912). Prus developed an original Utilitarian-inspired ethical system in his book, \"\"; his 1873 public lecture \"\", subsequently printed as a pamphlet, is a remarkably prescient contribution to what would, in the following century, become the field of logology (\"the science of science\").\n\nThe movement's leader was Prus' friend, Julian Ochorowicz (1850–1917), a trained philosopher with a doctorate from the University of Leipzig. In 1872 he wrote: \"We shall call a Positivist, anyone who bases assertions on verifiable evidence; who does not express himself categorically about doubtful things, and does not speak at all about those that are inaccessible.\"\n\nThe Warsaw Positivists—who included faithful Catholics such as Father Franciszek Krupiński (1836–98)—formed a common front against Messianism together with the Neo-Kantians. The Polish Kantians were rather loosely associated with Kant and belonged to the Positivist movement. They included Władysław Mieczysław Kozłowski (1858–1935), Piotr Chmielowski (1848–1904) and Marian Massonius (1862–1945).\n\nThe most brilliant philosophical mind in this period was Adam Mahrburg (1855–1913). He was a Positivist in his understanding of philosophy as a discipline and in his uncompromising ferreting out of speculation, and a Kantian in his interpretation of mind and in his centering of philosophy upon the theory of knowledge.\n\nIn Kraków, Father Stefan Pawlicki (1839–1916), professor of philosophy at the University of Kraków, was a man of broad culture and philosophical bent, but lacked talent for writing or teaching. Under his thirty-plus-year tenure, Kraków philosophy became mainly a historical discipline, alien to what was happening in the West and in Warsaw.\nEven before Poland regained independence at the end of World War I, her intellectual life continued to develop. This was the case particularly in Russian-ruled Warsaw, where in lieu of underground lectures and secret scholarly organizations a \"Wolna Wszechnica Polska\" (Free Polish University) was created in 1905 and the tireless Władysław Weryho (1868–1916) had in 1898 founded Poland's first philosophical journal, \"Przegląd Filozoficzny\" (The Philosophical Review), and in 1904 a Philosophical Society.\n\nIn 1907 Weryho founded a Psychological Society, and subsequently Psychological and Philosophical Institutes. About 1910 the small number of professionally trained philosophers increased sharply, as individuals returned who had been inspired by Mahrburg's underground lectures to study philosophy in Austrian-ruled Lwów and Kraków or abroad.\nKraków as well, especially after 1910, saw a quickening of the philosophical movement, particularly at the Polish Academy of Learning, where at the prompting of Władysław Heinrich there came into being in 1911 a Committee for the History of Polish Philosophy and there was an immense growth in the number of philosophical papers and publications, no longer only of a historical character.\n\nAt Lwów, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) from 1895 stimulated a lively philosophical movement, in 1904 founded the Polish Philosophical Society, and in 1911 began publication of \"Ruch Filozoficzny\" (The Philosophical Movement).\n\nThere was growing interest in western philosophical currents, and much discussion of Pragmatism and Bergsonism, psychoanalysis, Henri Poincaré's Conventionalism, Edmund Husserl's Phenomenology, the Marburg School, and the social-science methodologies of Wilhelm Dilthey and Heinrich Rickert. At the same time, original ideas developed on Polish soil.\n\nThose who distinguished themselves in Polish philosophy in these pre-World War I years of the twentieth century, formed two groups.\n\nOne group developed apart from institutions of higher learning and learned societies, and appealed less to trained philosophers than to broader circles, which it (if but briefly) captured. It constituted a reaction against the preceding period of Positivism, and included Stanisław Brzozowski (1878–1911), Wincenty Lutosławski (1863–1954) and, to a degree, Edward Abramowski (1868–1918).\n\nThe second group of philosophers who started off Polish philosophy in the twentieth century had an academic character. They included Władysław Heinrich (1869–1957) in Kraków, Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938) in Lwów, and Leon Petrażycki (1867–1931) abroad—all three, active members of the Polish Academy of Learning. Despite the considerable differences among them, they shared some basic features: all three were empiricists concerned not with metaphysics but with the foundations of philosophy; they were interested in philosophy itself, not merely its history; they understood philosophy in positive terms, but none of them was a Positivist in the old style.\n\nFollowing the restoration of Poland's independence in 1918, the two older universities (Kraków University, Lwów University) were joined by four new ones (Warsaw University, Poznań University, Wilno University, Lublin University). New philosophical journals appeared; all the university cities formed philosophical associations; conventions of Polish philosophers were held; philosophy became more professional, academic, scholarly.\n\nA characteristic of the interbellum was that maximalist, metaphysical currents began to fade away. The dominant ambition in philosophical theory now was not breadth but precision. This was a period of specialization, consistent with the conviction that general philosophy would not yield precise results such as could be obtained in logic, psychology or the history of philosophy.\n\nA few individuals did develop a general philosophical outlook: notably, Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886–1981), Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (1885–1939), and Roman Ingarden (1893–1970).\n\nOtherwise, however, specialization was the rule. The Kraków school, true to tradition, showed an eminently historical character and produced a medievalist of world renown, Father Konstanty Michalski (1879–1947). The Lwów school concentrated on the analysis of concepts; and in doing so, it considered both their aspects, the subjective and objective—hence, the psychological and the logical. Twardowski himself continued working at the border of psychology and logic; his pupils, however, generally split in their interests, specializing in either psychology or logic.\n\nThe analytical program that Twardowski passed on to his pupils, and which they in turn spread throughout Poland, was affined to that of Franz Brentano's school (Twardowski's \"alma mater\") in Austria and to that of the British analytic school, which likewise had arisen as a reaction against speculative systems.\n\nThe alumni of the Lwów school entered three distinct fields. Some devoted themselves to psychology: Stefan Błachowski (1889–1962), professor at Poznań, entirely; Władysław Witwicki (1878–1948), professor at Warsaw, partly. Others pursued the theory of knowledge: they included Kazimierz Ajdukiewicz (1890–1963), professor at Lwów, and after World War II at Poznań, whose views resembled Neopositivism and who developed an original theory of radical Conventionalism. The third group worked in mathematical, or symbolic, logic.\n\nThe most important center for mathematical logic was Warsaw. The Warsaw school of logic was headed by Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956) and Stanisław Leśniewski (1886–1939), professors at Warsaw University. The first of their pupils to achieve eminence, even before World War II, was Alfred Tarski (1902–83), from 1939 in the United States, where he became a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Another pupil of Łukasiewicz, Bolesław Sobociński (28 June 1906 – 31 October 1980), became a professor of philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. The Warsaw logic gained a worldwide importance similar to that of the Kraków medievalism.\n\nWarsaw was not, however, the sole Polish venue for logic studies. They were initiated at Kraków by Ivan Śleszyński (\"aka\" Jan Śleszyński, \"aka\" Ivan Vladislavovich Sleshinsky; 23 July 1854 – 9 March 1931), professor of mathematics and logic. At Kraków also, and later at Lwów, logic studies were conducted by Leon Chwistek (1884–1944), a multi-faceted and somewhat eccentric thinker—mathematician, philosopher, esthetician, painter—whose name came to be associated popularly with his concept of \"plural realities.\"\n\nAfter Petrażycki's death, the outstanding legal philosopher was Czesław Znamierowski (1888–1967), professor of philosophy at Poznań. Another leading thinker of the period, active on the borderlines of sociology and philosophy, in both Poland and the United States, was Florian Znaniecki (1882–1958).\n\nIn the interbellum, the philosopher members of the Polish Academy of Learning included Władysław Heinrich (1869–1957; Kraków), Kazimierz Twardowski (1866–1938; Lwów), Leon Petrażycki (1867–1931; Warsaw), and, from the following generation: Konstanty Michalski (1879–1947), Jan Łukasiewicz (1878–1956), and Władysław Tatarkiewicz (1886–1980). Michalski's historical works revolutionized prevailing views on \"via moderna\" in late medieval philosophy. Łukasiewicz gained world fame with his concept of many-valued logic and is known for his \"Polish notation.\" Tatarkiewicz was the first to prepare in Polish a large-scale comprehensive history of western philosophy and a \"History of Aesthetics\" and worked at systematizing the concepts of aesthetics and ethics.\n\nAfter World War II, Roman Ingarden (1893–1970), Tadeusz Kotarbiński (1886–1981), and Alfred Tarski became members of the Academy.\n\nFor some four decades following World War II, in Poland, a disproportionately prominent official role was given to Marxist philosophy. This, and contemporaneous sociopolitical currents, stimulated Leszek Kołakowski (1927–2009), writing in exile, to publish influential critiques of Marxist theory and communist practice. Kołakowski also wrote a remarkable history of \"Positivist Philosophy from Hume to the Vienna Circle\".\n\nSimilarly notable for his critiques of Soviet Marxism was Józef Maria Bocheński (1902–95), O.P., a Catholic philosopher of the Dominican Order who lectured in Rome at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas (the \"Angelicum\") and at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland. Bocheński also gained renown for his work in logic and ethics.\n\nOther Polish philosophers of the postwar period included (1938–2008), a logician and analytic philosopher of world influence, especially in the theory of induction, working at Warsaw University except for a three-decade hiatus beginning in 1968; Marek Siemek (1942–2011), a historian of German transcendental philosophy and recipient of an honorary doctorate from Bonn University; and Jan Woleński (born 1940), a broadly erudite thinker at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, specializing in the history of the Lwów-Warsaw school and in analytic philosophy and widely recognized in Poland as an atheist and exponent of replacing religion classes in Polish schools with philosophy classes.\n\n\n\n"}

Two broad types of interpretation can be distinguished: interpretations of physical objects, and interpretations of concepts (Conceptual model).\n\nInterpretation is related to perceiving the things. An aesthetic interpretation is an explanation of the meaning of some work of art. An aesthetic interpretation expresses an understanding of a work of art, a poem, performance, or piece of literature. There may be different interpretations to same work by art by different people owing to their different perceptions or aims. All such interpretations are termed as 'aesthetic interpretations'. Some people, instead of interpreting work of art, believe in interpreting artist himself. It pretty much means \"how or what do I believe about (subject)\"\n\nA judicial interpretation is a conceptual interpretation that explains how the judiciary should interpret the law, particularly constitutional documents and legislation (see statutory interpretation).\n\nIn logic, an interpretation is an assignment of meaning to the symbols of a language. The formal languages used in mathematics, logic, and theoretical computer science are defined in solely syntactic terms, and as such do not have any meaning until they are given some interpretation. The general study of interpretations of formal languages is called \"formal semantics\".\n\nReligious interpretation and similarly religious self-interpretation define a section of religion-related studies (theology, comparative religion, reason) where attention is given to aspects of perception—where religious symbolism and the self-image of all those who hold religious views have important bearing on how others perceive their particular belief system and its adherents.\n\nAn interpretation is a \"descriptive interpretation\" (also called a \"factual interpretation\") if at least one of the undefined symbols of its formal system becomes, in the interpretation, the name of a physical object, or observable property. A descriptive interpretation is a type of interpretation used in science and logic to talk about empirical entities.\n\nWhen scientists attempt to formalize the principles of the empirical sciences, they use an interpretation to model reality, in the same way logicians axiomatize the principles of logic. The aim of these attempts is to construct a formal system that will serve as a conceptual model of reality. Predictions or other statements drawn from such a formal system mirror or map the real world only insofar as these scientific models are true.\n\n"}

After Derby Grammar School, 1862–7, Wilson went up to Balliol College, Oxford in 1868, where he read both Classics and Mathematics. He graduated with a rare double double-first: gaining a 1st in Mathematical Moderations, 1869, 1st in Classical Moderations, 1870, 1st in Mathematics finals, 1871, and a 1st in Literae Humaniores ('Greats') in 1872. (He was, along with H. A. Prichard, one of Oxford's few early twentieth-century philosophers, to have a mathematical background.) Wilson became a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford in 1874. He was Wykeham Professor of Logic and a Fellow of New College, Oxford, from 1889 until his death. H. A. Prichard and W. D. Ross were among his students.\n\nMathematics, he said, is the best preparation for logic (\"Statement and Inference\", I : xxxviii). There is an amusing story of how he introduced calculus in a lecture to classically trained undergraduates. At the end of the lecture 'he walked smartly to the door, locked, or pretended to lock, it, and then standing there with his back to it said with decision : 'No one shall leave this room until you all grasp the essentials of this simple matter' (\"Statement and Inference\", I : xv). He had, however, little sympathy with the mathematical logic developed by Bertrand Russell.\n\nBelonging to a generation brought up in the atmosphere of British idealism, he espoused the cause of direct realism. His posthumous collected papers, \"Statement and Inference\", were influential on a generation of Oxford philosophers, including H. H. Price and Gilbert Ryle. He also features prominently in the work of J.L. Austin, John McDowell, and Timothy Williamson. P.F. Strawson's expression, 'the attributive tie', in \"Individuals\" (1959, 168) is named 'in memory of Cook Wilson'.\n\nIn his inaugural lecture Cook Wilson acknowledged that his deepest intellectual debts were to his mathematics tutor at Balliol, Henry Smith, to his Balliol philosophy tutor, T. H. Green, and to the classicist Henry Chandler.\n\nCook Wilson often argued for the existence of God as an experiential reality. He is quoted saying 'We don't want merely inferred friends, could we be satisfied with an inferred God?' He also had a long running dispute with Lewis Carroll over the Barber Shop Paradox.\n\nCook Wilson's classical contributions should not be overlooked : 'On rearrangements of the Fifth Books of the Ethics' (1879), 'On the Structure of the Seventh Book of the Nicomachean Ethics, ch. i – x (1879); 'On the Interpretation of Plato's Timaeus' (1889); 'On the Geometrical Problem in Plato's \"Meno\"' (1903) and others listed at lxvi–lxxii of \"Statement and Inference\", I.

L. Mackie and Quentin Smith, and has been used in Christian apologetics. \nAccording to Michael Martin, the cosmological arguments presented by Craig, Bruce Reichenbach, and Richard Swinburne are \"among the most sophisticated and well argued in contemporary theological philosophy\", while also noting that, in reference to Craig's argument specifically, \"there may have been trillions of personal agents involved in the creation\". \n\nThe Kalam argument's underpinning is the impossibility of an actual infinite, which is what distinguishes it from other cosmological arguments such as that of Thomas Aquinas, which rests on the impossibility of an essentially ordered infinite regress, and that of Leibniz and Clark, which uses the Principle of Sufficient Reason.\n\nCraig states the Kalam cosmological argument as a brief syllogism, most commonly rendered as follows:\n\nFrom the conclusion of the initial syllogism, he appends a further premise and conclusion based upon ontological analysis of the properties of the cause:\n\nReferring to the implications of Classical Theism that follow from this argument, Craig writes:\n\nThe Kalam cosmological argument is based on the concept of the prime-mover, introduced by Aristotle, and entered early Christian or Neoplatonist philosophy in Late Antiquity, being developed by John Philoponus. Along with much of classical Greek philosophy, the concept was adopted into medieval Islamic tradition, where it received its fullest articulation at the hands of Muslim scholars, most directly by Islamic theologians of the Sunni tradition.\n\nIts historic proponents include Al-Kindi, Al-Ghazali, and St. Bonaventure.\n\nOne of the earliest formulations of the cosmological argument in Islamic tradition comes from Al-Kindi (9th century), who was one of the first Islamic philosophers to attempt to introduce an argument for the existence of God based upon purely empirical premises. His chief contribution is the cosmological argument (dalil al-huduth) for the existence of God, in his work \"On First Philosophy\". He writes:\n\nBetween the 9th to 12th centuries, the cosmological argument developed as a concept within Islamic theology. \nIt was refined in the 11th century by Al-Ghazali (\"The Incoherence of the Philosophers\"), and in the 12th by Ibn Rushd (Averroes). It reached medieval Christian philosophy in the 13th century, and was discussed by Bonaventure, as well as Thomas Aquinas in his \"Summa Theologica\" (I, q.2, a.3) and \"Summa Contra Gentiles\" (I, 13).\n\nIslamic perspectives may be divided into positive Aristotelian responses strongly supporting the argument, such as those by Al-Kindi, and Averroes, and negative responses critical of it, including those by Al-Ghazali and Muhammad Iqbal. Al-Ghazali was unconvinced by the first-cause arguments of Al-Kindi, arguing that only the infinite \"per se\" is impossible, arguing for the possibility of the infinite \"per accidens\". He writes:\n\nMuhammad Iqbal also stated:\n\nAccording to atheist philosopher Quentin Smith, \"a count of the articles in the philosophy journals shows that more articles have been published about Craig’s defense of the Kalam argument than have been published about any other philosopher’s contemporary formulation of an argument for God’s existence.\"\n\nThe Kalam cosmological argument has received criticism from philosophers such as J. L. Mackie, Graham Oppy, Michael Martin, Quentin Smith, physicists Paul Davies, Lawrence Krauss and Victor Stenger, and authors such as Dan Barker.\n\nModern discourse encompasses the fields of both philosophy and science (quantum physics and cosmology), which Bruce Reichenbach summarises as:\n\nRichard Dawkins stated in The God Delusion when referring to cosmological arguments \"The five ‘proofs’ asserted by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century don’t prove anything, and are easily—though I hesitate to say so, given his eminence—exposed as vacuous. The first three are just different ways of saying the same thing, and they can be considered together. All involve an infinite regress—the answer to a question raises a prior question, and so on ad infinitum.\nAll three of these arguments rely upon the idea of a regress and invoke God to terminate it. They make the entirely unwarranted assumption that God himself is immune to the regress. Even if we allow the dubious luxury of arbitrarily conjuring up a terminator to an infinite regress and giving it a name, simply because we need one, there is absolutely no reason to endow that terminator with any of the properties normally ascribed to God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness, creativity of design, to say nothing of such human attributes as listening to prayers, forgiving sins and reading innermost thoughts.\" \n\nCraig defends the first premise as follows:\n\n\nAccording to Reichenbach, \"the Causal Principle has been the subject of extended criticism\", which can be divided into philosophical and scientific criticisms.\n\nGraham Oppy, J. L. Mackie and Wes Morriston have objected to the intuitiveness of the first premise. Oppy states:\n\nMackie affirms that there is no good reason to assume \"a priori\" that an uncaused beginning of all things is impossible. Moreover, that the Causal Principle cannot be extrapolated to the universe from inductive experience. He appeals to David Hume's thesis (\"An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding\") that effects without causes can be conceived in the mind, and that what is conceivable in the mind is possible in the real world. This argument has been criticised by Bruce Reichenbach and G.E.M. Anscombe, who point out the phenomenological and logical problems in inferring factual possibility from conceivability. Craig notes:\n\nMorriston asserts that causal laws are physical processes for which we have intuitive knowledge in the context of events within time and space, but that such intuitions do not hold true for the beginning of time itself. He states:\n\nIn reply, Craig has maintained that causal laws are unrestricted metaphysical truths that are \"not contingent upon the properties, causal powers, and dispositions of the natural kinds of substances which happen to exist\", remarking that:\n\nIn support of the first premise, Andrew Loke reasons that if something (e.g. universe=physical reality as a whole) begins to exist without any antecedent necessary condition whatsoever, then many other kinds of things which can begin to exist within our universe would also begin to exist within our universe without antecedent condition, because (i) there would not be any antecedent condition which would make it the case that only universes (rather than these other kinds of things) begins to exist, and (ii) the properties of universes and the properties of other kinds of things which differentiate between them would be had by them only when they had already begun to exist. In that case our universe would have been very different.\n\nA common objection to premise one appeals to the phenomenon of quantum indeterminacy, where, at the subatomic level, the causal principle appears to break down. Craig replies that the phenomenon of indeterminism is specific to the Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, pointing out that this is only one of a number of different interpretations, some of which he states are fully deterministic (mentioning David Bohm) and none of which are as yet known to be true. He concludes that subatomic physics is not a proven exception to the first premise.\n\nPhilosopher Quentin Smith has cited the example of virtual particles, which appear and disappear from observation, apparently at random, to assert the tenability of uncaused natural phenomena. In his book \"\", cosmologist Lawrence Krauss has proposed how quantum mechanics can explain how space-time and matter can emerge from \"nothing\" (referring to the quantum vacuum). Philosopher Michael Martin has also referred to quantum vacuum fluctuation models to support the idea of a universe with uncaused beginnings. He writes:\n\nPhilosopher of science David Albert has criticised the use of the term \"nothing\" in describing the quantum vacuum. In a review of Krauss's book, he states:\n\nLikewise, Craig also argued that the quantum vacuum, in containing quantifiable, measurable energy, cannot be described as \"nothing\", therefore, that phenomena originating from the quantum vacuum cannot be described as \"uncaused\". On the topic of virtual particles, he writes:\n\nCraig justifies premise two using both physical arguments with evidence from cosmology and physics, and metaphysical arguments for the impossibility of actual infinities in reality.\n\nFor physical evidence, Craig appeals to:\n\n\nProfessor Alexander Vilenkin, one of the three authors of the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem, writes:\n\nVictor J. Stenger has referred to the Aguirre-Gratton model for eternal inflation as an exemplar by which others disagree with the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem. In private correspondence with Stenger, Vilenkin remarked how the Aguirre-Gratton model attempts to evade a beginning by reversing the \"arrow of time\" at \"t = 0\", but that: \"This makes the moment \"t = 0\" rather special. I would say no less special than a true beginning of the universe.\"\n\nAt the \"State of the Universe\" conference at Cambridge University in January 2012, Vilenkin discussed problems with various theories that would claim to avoid the need for a cosmological beginning, alleging the untenability of eternal inflation, cyclic and cosmic egg models, eventually concluding: \"All the evidence we have says that the universe had a beginning.\" However, in an interview in 2014 Vilenkin said:\n\nWhen asked if his work \"proves the existence of God or at least of a divine moment of creation,\" Vilenkin responded \"I don’t think it proves anything one way or another.\"\n\nIn 2015, cosmologists Ahmed Farag Ali and Saurya Das published a paper outlining a model which applies quantum correction terms to complement Einstein's theory of general relativity and suggests that the universe may have existed forever.\n\nOn the impossibility of actual infinities, Craig asserts:\n\n\nMichael Martin disagrees with these assertions by Craig, saying:\n\nAndrew Loke, however, thinks that even if an actual infinite is possible, there is an argument to show that it is impossible to traverse it. He proposes the following argument:\n\n\nBut Loke, in fact, also proposes an argument against the metaphysical possibility of a concrete actual infinite using the case of a ‘Christmas present generator’ and a 'person generator.' .\n\nIn a critique of Craig's book \"The Kalam Cosmological Argument\", published in 1979, Michael Martin states:\nMartin also claims that Craig has not justified his claim of creation \"ex nihilo\", pointing out that the universe may have been created from pre-existing material in a timeless or eternal state. Moreover, that Craig takes his argument too far beyond what his premises allow in deducing that the creating agent is greater than the universe. For this, he cites the example of a parent \"creating\" a child who eventually becomes greater than he or she.\n\nIn the subsequent \"Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology\", published in 2009, Craig discusses the properties of the cause of the universe, explaining how they follow by entailment from the initial syllogism of the Kalam cosmological argument:\n\n\nCraig concludes that the cause of the existence of the universe is an \"uncaused, personal Creator ... who \"sans\" the universe is beginningless, changeless, immaterial, timeless, spaceless and enormously powerful\"; remarking upon the theological implications of this union of properties.\n\nCraig maintains that the Kalam cosmological argument involves a commitment to the A-theory of time, also known as the \"tensed theory of time\" or presentism, as opposed to its alternative, the B-theory of time, also known as the \"tenseless theory of time\" or eternalism. The latter would allow the universe to exist tenselessly as a four-dimensional space-time block, under which circumstances the universe would not \"begin to exist\":\n\nCraig has defended the A-theory against objections from J. M. E. McTaggart and Hybrid A-B theorists. Philosopher Yuri Balashov has criticised Craig's attempt to reconcile the A-theory with special relativity by relying on a ‘neo‐Lorentzian interpretation’ of Special Relativity. Balashov claims:\n\nIn response to Balashov, Craig criticises Balashov for adopting a verificationist methodology that fails to address the metaphysical and theological foundations of the A-theory.\n\nIt has recently been argued that a defense of the Kalam cosmological argument does not have to involve such a commitment to the A-theory.\n\n\n\n"}

At the \"École Normale\" he came under the influence of Victor Cousin. In 1816 he adopted the profession of higher teaching, and was soon after called to the chair of philosophy in the University of Strasbourg. He held this position for many years, and gave a parallel course of lectures as professor of the literary faculty in the same city. The reaction against speculative philosophy, which carried away De Maistre and Lamennais, influenced him also.\n\nIn 1828 he took orders, and resigned his chair at the university. For several years he remained at Strasbourg, lecturing at the Faculty and at the college of Juilly, but in 1849 he set out for Paris as vicar of the diocese. At Paris he obtained considerable reputation as an orator, and in 1853 was made professor of moral theology at the theological faculty. This post he held till his death.\n\nLike the Scholastics, he distinguished reason and faith, and held that revelation supplies facts, otherwise unattainable, which philosophy is able to group by scientific methods. Theology and philosophy thus form one comprehensive science. Yet Bautain was no rationalist; like Pascal and Newman he exalted faith above reason. He pointed out, following chiefly the Kantian criticism, that reason can never yield knowledge of things in themselves. But there exists in addition to reason another faculty which may be called intelligence, through which we are put in connection with spiritual and invisible truth. This intelligence does not of itself yield a body of truth; it merely contains the germs of the higher ideas, and these are made productive by being brought into contact with revealed facts. This fundamental conception Bautain worked out in the departments of psychology and morals.\n\nThe details of this theology are highly imaginative. He says, for instance, that there is a spirit of the world and a spirit of nature; the latter gives birth to a physical and psychical spirit, and the physical spirit to the animal and vegetable spirits. His theories may well be compared with the arbitrary mysticism of van Helmont and the Gnostics. \n\nThe most important of his works are:\n\n"}
{"id": "553904", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=553904", "title": "Mahasiddha", "text": "Mahasiddha\n\nMahasiddha (Sanskrit: \"mahāsiddha\" \"great adept; ) is a term for someone who embodies and cultivates the \"siddhi of perfection\". A siddha is an individual who, through the practice of sādhanā, attains the realization of siddhis, psychic and spiritual abilities and powers.\nMahasiddhas were practicioners of yoga and tantra, or \"tantrika\"s. Their historical influence throughout the Indian subcontinent and the Himalayas was vast and they reached mythic proportions as codified in their songs of realization and hagiographies, or namtars, many of which have been preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. The Mahasiddhas are the founders of Vajrayana traditions and lineages such as Dzogchen and Mahamudra.\n\nRobert Thurman explains the symbiotic relationship between Tantric Buddhist communities and the Buddhist universities such as Nalanda which flourished at the same time:\nThe exact genealogy and historical dates of the Mahasiddhas are contentious. Dowman (1986) holds that they all lived between 750 and 1150 CE.\n\nAbhayadatta Sri is an Indian scholar of the 12th century who is claimed to have recorded the hagiographies of the eighty-four siddhas in a text known as \"The History of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas\" (Sanskrit: \"Caturasitisiddha pravrtti\"; ).\n\nDowman holds that the eighty-four Mahasiddha are spiritual archetypes:\n\nReynolds (2007) states that the mahasiddha tradition \"evolved in North India in the early Medieval Period (3–13 cen. CE). Philosophically this movement was based on the insights revealed in the Mahayana Sutras and as systematized in the Madhyamaka and Chittamatrin schools of philosophy, but the methods of meditation and practice were radically different than anything seen in the monasteries. He proffers that the mahasiddha tradition \"broke with the conventions of Buddhist monastic life of the time, and abandoning the monastery they practiced in the caves, the forests, and the country villages of Northern India. In complete contrast to the settled monastic establishment of their day, which concentrated the Buddhist intelligenzia [\"sic.\"] in a limited number of large monastic universities, they adopted the life-style of itinerant mendicants, much as the wandering Sadhus of modern India.\"\n\nThe charnel ground conveys how great mahasiddhas in the Nath and Vajrayana traditions such as Tilopa (988–1069) and Gorakshanath (fl. 11th – 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the \"ground\" (Sanskrit: āśraya; ) of realization:\nIn his study of the Hevajra Tantra, David Snellgrove outlines the typical tantric siddha or yogi. After experiencing the consummation of enlightenment in the embrace of a female consort:\nThereafter the pupil is free to pursue the practice of strenuous meditation and physical self-control, and after five years or more he will perhaps succeed. He receives the five symbolic adornments, crown, ear-rings, necklace, bracelets, girdle, signs of his success. These he wears on those set occasions, the eighth or fifteenth day of the dark-fortnight, when perfected yogins and yoginis come together, to consume the flesh and wine, to sing and dance, and realize their consummation of bliss. He is free from all conventions and wanders as he pleases, knowing no distinction between friend or foe, clean or unclean, good or evil.\n\nAccording to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. In many instances more than one siddha with the same name exists, so it must be assumed that fewer than thirty siddhas of the two traditions actually relate to the same historical persons. In the days when the siddhas of the later Tibetan traditions flourished in India (i.e., between the 9th and 11th centuries), it was not uncommon for initiates to assume the names of famous adepts of the past. Sometimes a disciple would have the same name as his guru, while still other names were based on caste or tribe. In such a context the distinction between siddhas of the same name becomes blurred. The entire process of distinguishing between siddhas with the same name of different texts and lineages is therefore to large extent guesswork. The great variation in phonetic transcription of Indian words into Tibetan may partly be the result of various Tibetan dialects. In the process of copying the Tibetan transcriptions in later times, the spelling often became corrupted to such an extent that the recognition or reconstitution of the original names became all but impossible. Whatever the reasons might be, the Tibetan transcription of Indian names of mahasiddhas clearly becomes more and more corrupt as time passes.\n\nLocal folk tradition refers to a number of icons and sacred sites to the eighty-four Mahasiddha at Bharmour (formerly known as Brahmapura) in the Chaurasi complex. The word \"chaurasi\" means \"eighty-four\".\n\nA number of archaeological sacred sites require iconographic analysis in the Chaurasi complex in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Although it might be hagiographical accretion and folk lore, it is said that in the reign of Sahil Varman:\n\nThe \"Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti\" (CSP), “The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas”, compiled by Abhayadatta Sri, a Northern Indian Sanskrit text dating from the 11th or 12th century, comes from a tradition prevalent in the ancient city-state of Campa in the modern district of Bihar. Only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text seem to have survived. This text was translated into Tibetan by sMon grub Shes rab and is known as the \"Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i lo rgyus\" or “The Legends of the Eighty-four Siddhas”. It has been suggested that Abhayadatta Sri is identical with the great Indian scholar Mahapandita Abhayakaragupta (late 11th–early 12th century), the compiler of the iconographic compendiums \"Vajravali\", \"Nispannayogavali\", and \"Jyotirmanjari\".\n\nThe other major Tibetan tradition is based on the list contained in the \"Caturasiti-siddhabhyarthana\" (CSA) by Ratnakaragupta of Vajrasana, identical with Bodhgaya (Tib.: rDo rje gdan) located in Bihar, Northern India. The Tibetan translation is known as \"Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi’i gsol ’debs \" by rDo rje gdan pa. There exist several Tibetan versions of the list of mahasiddhas based on the Vajrasana text. However, these Tibetan texts differ in many cases with regard to the Tibetan transcriptions of the Indian mahasiddhas names.\n\nBy convention there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas in both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, with some overlap between the two lists. The number is congruent with the number of siddhi or occult powers held in the Indian Religions. In Tibetan Buddhist art they are often depicted together as a matched set in works such as thangka paintings where they may be used collectively as border decorations around a central figure.\n\nEach Mahasiddha has come to be known for certain characteristics and teachings, which facilitates their pedagogical use. One of the most beloved Mahasiddhas is Virupa, who may be taken as the patron saint of the Sakyapa sect and instituted the Lamdré (Tibetan: \"lam 'bras\") teachings. Virupa (alternate orthographies: Birwapa/Birupa) lived in 9th century India and was known for his great attainments.\n\nSome of the methods and practices of the Mahasiddha were codified in Buddhist scriptures known as Tantras. Traditionally the ultimate source of these methods and practices is held to be the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, but often it is a transhistorical aspect of the Buddha or deity Vajradhara or Samantabhadra who reveals the Tantra in question directly to the Mahasiddha in a vision or whilst they dream or are in a trance. This form of the deity is known as a sambhogakaya manifestation. The sadhana of Dream Yoga as practiced in Dzogchen traditions such as the Kham, entered the Himalayan tantric tradition from the Mahasiddha, Ngagpa and Bonpo. Dream Yoga or \"Milam\" (T:rmi-lam; S:svapnadarśana), is one of the Six Yogas of Naropa.\n\nFour of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas are women. They are:\nVon Schroeder (2006) states:\n\nIn Vajrayana Buddhism there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas. The list below includes their name and their epithet. An asterisk after their name denotes a female Mahasiddha.\n\nAccording to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. It is therefore also wrong to state that in Buddhism are 84 Mahasiddhas. The correct title should therefore be \"Names of the 84 Mahasiddhas according to the Abhayadatta Sri Tradition\". It should also be clearly stated that only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text \"Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti\" (CSP) or \"The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas\" seem to have survived. This means that many Sanskrit names of the Abhayadatta Sri tradition had to be reconstructed and perhaps not always correctly.\n\nAccording to Ulrich von Schroeder for the identification of Mahasiddhas inscribed with Tibetan names it is necessary to reconstruct the Indian names. This is a very difficult task because the Tibetans are very inconsistent with the transcription or translation of Indian personal names and therefore many different spellings do exist. When comparing the different Tibetan texts on mahasiddhas, we can see that the transcription or translation of the names of the Indian masters into the Tibetan language was inconsistent and confused. The most unsettling example is an illustrated Tibetan block print from Mongolia about the mahasiddhas, where the spellings in the text vary greatly from the captions of the xylographs. To quote a few examples: Kankaripa [Skt.] is named Kam ka li/Kangga la pa; Goraksa [Skt.]: Go ra kha/Gau raksi; Tilopa [Skt.]: Ti la blo ba/Ti lla pa; Dukhandi [Skt.]: Dha khan dhi pa/Dwa kanti; Dhobipa [Skt.]: Tom bhi pa/Dhu pi ra; Dengipa (CSP 31): Deng gi pa / Tinggi pa; Dhokaripa [Skt.]: Dho ka ra / Dhe ki ri pa; Carbaripa (Carpati) [Skt.]: Tsa ba ri pa/Tsa rwa ti pa; Sakara [Skt.]: Phu rtsas ga’/Ka ra pa; Putalipa [Skt.]: Pu ta la/Bu ta li, etc. In the same illustrated Tibetan text we find another inconsistency: the alternate use of transcription and translation. Examples are Nagarjuna [Skt.]: Na ga’i dzu na/Klu sgrub; Aryadeva (Karnaripa) [Skt.]: Ka na ri pa/’Phags pa lha; and Ghantapa [Skt.]: Ghanda pa/rDo rje dril bu pa, to name a few.\n\nFor the identification of individual mahasiddhas the concordance lists published by Ulrich von Schroeder are useful tools for every scholar. The purpose of the concordance lists published in the appendices of his book is primarily for the reconstitution of the Indian names, regardless of whether they actually represent the same historical person or not. The index of his book contains more than 1000 different Tibetan spellings of mahasiddha names.\n\nTibetan masters of various lineages are often referred to as mahasiddhas. Among them are Marpa, the Tibetan translator who brought Buddhist texts to Tibet, and Milarepa. In Buddhist iconography, Milarepa is often represented with his right hand cupped against his ear, to listen to the needs of all beings. Another interpretation of the imagery is that the teacher is engaged in a secret yogic exercise (e.g. see Lukhang). (Note: Marpa and Milarepa are not mahasiddhas in the historical sense, meaning they are not 2 of the 84 traditional mahasiddhas. However, this says nothing about their realization.) Lawapa the progenitor of Dream Yoga sadhana was a mahasiddha.\n\n\n\n\n"}

The work is supposedly by Aristotle, but there is not universal agreement on this point. It only survives now as fragments in quotations by Alexander of Aphrodisias in his commentary of Aristotle's \"Metaphysics\".\n\n\"On Ideas\" gives greater detail to many of the arguments which Aristotle recounts in \"Metaphysics\" A.9. There and here objections to arguments for Plato's theory of Forms are given. A point made in multiple places is that the Platonist arguments establish only that there are universals in a general and metaphysically slim sense, and not there are full-blown Forms of the Platonic kind. A version of the third man argument is also given.\n\nAlexander of Aphrodisias does attribute his quotations which form the extant text of \"On Ideas\" to Aristotle.

The approach expressed in these principles is commonly known as policing by consent in the United Kingdom and other countries such as Canada, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn this model of policing, police officers are regarded as citizens in uniform. They exercise their powers to police their fellow citizens with the implicit consent of those fellow citizens. \"Policing by consent\" indicates that the legitimacy of policing in the eyes of the public is based upon a general consensus of support that follows from transparency about their powers, their integrity in exercising those powers and their accountability for doing so.\n\nIn early 19th-century Britain, attempts by the government to set up a police force for London met with a lot of opposition:\n\nThe concept of professional policing was taken up by Robert Peel when he became Home Secretary in 1822. Peel's Metropolitan Police Act 1829 established a full-time, professional and centrally-organised police force for the Greater London area, known as the Metropolitan Police.\n\nNine principles were set out in the \"General Instructions\" issued to every new police officer in the Metropolitan Police from 1829. Although Peel discussed the spirit of some of these principles in his speeches and other communications, the historians Susan Lentz and Robert Chaires found no proof that he compiled a formal list. The Home Office has suggested that the instructions were probably written, not by Peel himself, but by Charles Rowan and Richard Mayne, the joint Commissioners of the Metropolitan Police when it was founded.\n\nThe nine principles were as follows:\n\n\nThe historian Charles Reith explained in his \"New Study of Police History\" (1956) that these principles constituted an approach to policing \"unique in history and throughout the world, because it derived, not from fear, but almost exclusively from public co-operation with the police, induced by them designedly by behaviour which secures and maintains for them the approval, respect and affection of the public\". \n\nThe Home Office in 2012 explained this approach as \"the power of the police coming from the common consent of the public, as opposed to the power of the state. It does not mean the consent of an individual\" and added an additional statement outside of the Peelian principles: \"No individual can choose to withdraw his or her consent from the police, or from a law.\"\n\nModern police reformers have described the Peelian Principles as being relevant in the present day, with American law-enforcement officer William Bratton calling them \"my bible.\"\n\n"}

His primary areas of research are the philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and cognitive science.\n\nIn his book, \"Existential Cognition: Minds in the World\", McClamrock argued for the extreme importance of the external environment (both social and physical) in the determination of almost all varieties of human and animal behavior. His position is that the methodological individualism inherent in many contemporary forms of computational theories of the mind are completely inadequate and that we must look to the interactions between organism and world in order to find \"external mechanisms that mediate behavior\" as well as the usual internal mechanisms. Borrowing from Herbert A. Simon and also influenced by the ideas of existential phenomenologists such as Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Martin Heidegger, McClamrock suggests that man's condition of being-in-the-world makes it impossible for him to understand himself by abstracting away from it and examining it as if it were a detached experimental object of which he himself is not an integral part. \n\nHowever, unlike the continental philosophers, McClamrock relies upon results from modern information sciences, biology and cognitive science to support his conclusions about the \"bounded and embedded\" nature of consciousness and the mind as a whole. One of his examples, taken from David Marr, discusses the exploitation of local environmental regularities in the control mechanisms of the common fly. \n\nThe local surface mediates the signal from brain to wings, illustrating the point that the human nervous system may be said, in a certain sense, to extend to parts of its external environment.\n\nIn another example, McClamrock cites the case of a man driving from one destination to another. On the way, he encounters various external signals and stimuli (street names, direction signs, people who provide information when asked, landmarks, etc..) and all of these help him, in many cases are indispensable to, his successfully finding his way from point A to point B. The path he ends up traveling to get to point B from point A is, in any case, partially determined by his environment. In the case of ants, this is even clearer. When we look at the tracks that ants make as a result of their movements, they seemed to be highly ordered and preplanned. But, in fact, an ant will usually encounter unforeseen and unforeseeable obstacles as it makes its way along from one point to another. At each obstacle, it will be constrained to make a choice that it otherwise wouldn't. The path that it ultimately travels will therefore be heavily determined by its exterior environment, as well its behavior.\n\nMcClamrock's article \"Emergence Unscathed: Kim on Non-Reducible Types\" took on Jaegwon Kim's famous \"causal powers\" argument against multiple realizability. Kim argued that multiple realizability conflicts with fundamental constraints on the definition of kinds and with general rules of scientific taxonomy. Kim's argument is based on two essential premises: \n\nFrom this it follows that:\n\nThe second premise is \n\nFrom all of this, it follows, according to Kim, that \"if mental kinds are multiply realizable, then they are disqualified as proper scientific kinds...because they are realized by diverse physical causal kinds.\"\n\nMcClamrock flatly rejected Kim's claim that \"instances of M that are realized by the same physical base must be grouped under one kind\". It is a consequence of token materialism that a complete specification of the causal powers of a mental kind at a certain time will be a complete specification of the causal powers of the physical state which implements it. But Kim's assertion only follows if we assume that the \"only\" specification of causal kinds can be in terms of causal powers of tokens. McClamrock suggested understanding higher-level causal powers as simply more general and abstract \"characterizations\" of the lower-level causal powers implemented in the physical structure of a system. There are many varieties of causal taxonomy classifying things according to various kinds of causal powers they possess. For example, a taxonomy of orbiting bodies may specify the causal powers of objects in terms of mass, position and velocity – abstracting from the body's chemical composition, geology or microbiotic agglomerations. Such an abstract and incomplete characterization of the causal powers of a system makes it possible to group together physically type-distinct instances of the higher-level kind (in this case, planets, stars and other orbiting bodies).\n\nMoreover, taxonomies in computer science are typically characterized by such abstractions. What is of interest at the level of information processing are such things as registers and microprogramming operations, not the causal powers of the material structure of semiconductors.\n\n\n"}

The different forms of spelling is driven by euphonic (sandhi) rules of Sanskrit, useful in different contexts.\n\n\n\"Satchitananda\" is therefore translated as \"Truth Consciousness Bliss\", \"Reality Consciousness Bliss\", \"Existence Consciousness Bliss\",\n\nThe term is contextually related to \"the ultimate reality\" in various schools of Hindu traditions. In theistic traditions, \"sacchidananda\" is same as God such as Vishnu, Shiva or Goddess in Shakti traditions. In monist traditions, \"sacchidananda\" is considered directly inseparable from \"nirguna\" (attributeless) Brahman or the \"universal wholeness of existence\", wherein the Brahman is identical with Atman, the true individual self. \"Satchitananda\" or Brahman is held to be the source of all reality, source of all conscious thought, and source of all perfection-bliss. It is the ultimate, the complete, the destination of spiritual pursuit in Hinduism.\n\nThe Brihadaranyaka Upanishad ( 800–600 BCE) is among the earliest Hindu texts which links and then discusses Atman (soul), Brahman (ultimate reality), awareness, joy and bliss such as in sections 2.4, 3.9 and 4.3. The Chandogya Upanishad (~800-600 BCE), in section 3.14 to 3.18, discusses Atman and Brahman, these being identical to \"that which shines and glows both inside and outside\", \"dear\", \"pure knowing, awareness\", \"one's innermost being\", \"highest light\", \"luminous\". Other 1st-millennium BCE texts, such as the Taittiriya Upanishad in section 2.1, as well as minor Upanishads, discuss Atman and Brahman in saccidananda-related terminology.\n\nAn early mention of the compound word \"sacchidananda\" is in verse 3.11 of Tejobindu Upanishad, composed before the 4th-century CE. The context of \"sacchidananda\" is explained in the Upanishad as follows:\n\nThe Vedantic philosophy understands \"saccidānanda\" as a synonym of the three fundamental attributes of Brahman. In Advaita Vedanta, states Werner, it is the sublimely blissful experience of the boundless, pure consciousness and represents the unity of spiritual essence of ultimate reality.\n\nSaccidānanda is an epithet for Brahman, considered indescribable, unitary, ultimate, unchanging reality in Hinduism.\n\nTulsidas considers Rama as \"Satcitananda\".\n\n\n\n"}

The flag or banner is officially defined as a white field with a red border, with a blue star for each family member serving in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or hostilities. A gold star (with a blue edge) represents a family member that died during Military Operations. This includes those who lost their lives during World War I, World War II, or during any subsequent period of armed hostilities in which the United States was engaged before July 1, 1958; \n\nor those who lost or lose their lives after June 30, 1958:\n\n\nor those who lost or lose their lives after March 28, 1973, as a result of:\n\n\nBased on the star symbols used on the service flag, the term \"Blue Star\" has come into use in the United States as a reference to having a family member in active military service, and the term \"Gold Star\" has come to refer to the loss of a family member in military service. For example, the mother of a person who died in service is referred to as a \"Gold Star mother\", and the wife of an active service member is referred to as a \"Blue Star wife\". Charitable support organizations have been established for Gold Star mothers, Gold Star wives, Blue Star mothers, and Blue Star wives. The last Sunday in September is observed as Gold Star Mother's Day, Gold Star family members are entitled to wear a Gold Star Lapel Button, and all 50 U.S. states and Guam offer some form of a specialty license plate for motor vehicles owned by Gold Star family members.\n\nThe use of the terms has sometimes been restricted to refer to service during specific armed conflicts. For example, the service banner originally applied only to World War I, and it was later expanded to include service in World War II, then the Korean War, then other specific conflicts, and then \"any period of war or hostilities\". In some current uses of the \"star\" terminology, there is no longer any distinction made about the place or time or degree of hostility involved in the military service. For Gold Stars, the Department of Defense also makes a distinction about the manner and place of death, but some other organizations do not. The Gold Star term is also sometimes interpreted to apply to those missing in action and those who did not die during active service but died later as a result of an in-service injury.\n\nA lesser-known practice of using a silver star to indicate a service member that has been disabled is sometimes also followed, although this practice is not recognized in federal law.\n\nThe banner was designed in 1917 by United States Army Captain Robert L. Queisser of the Fifth Ohio Infantry, in honor of his two sons who were serving in World War I. It was quickly adopted by the public and by government officials. On September 24, 1917, an Ohio congressman read into the Congressional Record:\n\nThe mayor of Cleveland, the Chamber of Commerce and the Governor of Ohio have adopted this service flag. The world should know of those who give so much for liberty. The dearest thing in all the world to a father and mother – their children.\n\nThese flags were first used in World War I, with subsequent standardization and codification by the end of World War II. They were not popular during the Vietnam War, but have come back into use since the first Gulf War / Operation Desert Storm. In modern usage, an organization may fly a service flag if one of its members is serving active duty.\n\nManufacture of these flags is only allowed by specific government license in the territories under U.S. jurisdiction. The same section of the United States Code that limits manufacture of the banner also mentions lapel pins. There is no legal specification of the banner's size, but according to the DoD code, the flag size ratio must be 10:19, the same as the Flag of the United States. When displayed with the national flag, the latter should take the place of honor. If the flags displayed differ in size, the national flag should be larger.\n\nBlue and gold are the only colors specified for use, but silver stars are increasingly in use to represent those discharged from service because of wounds or being invalided home. The Silver Star Families of America is an organization attempting to encourage the U.S. Congress to make the Silver Star Service Banner official for those wounded or injured in a war zone. Forty-nine states, Guam, Saipan, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Chickasaw Nation and over 2,700 cities and counties have issued proclamations in support of the Silver Star Banner and of Silver Star Service Banner Day on May 1 of every year.\n\nOn April 21, 2010, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution 855, a stand-alone resolution recognizing the Silver Star Service Banner and making May 1 Silver Star Service Banner Day. One state, Missouri, took steps to make such recognition a state law.\n\nIn World War II, the Brazilian \"Clube Militar\" (Military Club) and the \"Casino da Urca\" adopted the concepts of the U.S. service banner by giving posters to the family members of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force. On these posters the phrase \"Daqui saiu um Expedicionário\" was written, which means \"From here came an Expeditionary\". Although the design differs from the U.S. banners, the mothers of the Brazilian soldiers also received a pin prominently featuring a blue star similar to U.S. pins.\n\nThe individuals entitled to display the service flag are officially defined in which reads:\n\nA service flag approved by the Secretary of Defense may be displayed in a window of the place of residence of individuals who are members of the immediate family of an individual serving in the Armed Forces of the United States during any period of war or hostilities in which the Armed Forces of the United States are engaged.\n\nThe U.S. Code also discusses the wearing of lapel pins.\n\nOn the last Sunday in September, Gold Star Mother's Day is observed in the U.S. in honor of Gold Star mothers, as established in Title 36 § 111 of the United States Code. This was originally declared by Senate Joint Resolution 115 of June 23, 1936.\n\nIn 2009, Barack Obama proclaimed the observance as Gold Star Mother's and Families' Day. Since 2011 it has been proclaimed as Gold Star Mother's and Family's Day.\n\nAll fifty U.S. states and Guam offer some form of a specialty license plate for motor vehicles owned by members of Gold Star families.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "47211116", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47211116", "title": "Shanrendao", "text": "Shanrendao\n\nShanrendao (善人道 \"Way of the Virtuous Man\") is a Confucian religious movement in northeast China. Its name as a social body is the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue (万国道德会 \"Wànguó Dàodéhuì\") or simply the Church of the Way and its Virtue (道德会 \"Dàodéhuì\"), which is frequently translated as the Morality Church. Shanrendao can be viewed as one of the best examples of the \"jiàohuà\" (教化 \"spiritual transformation\") movements.\n\nIt is one of the most prominent religions of redemption of China, and was formally established as the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in Shandong in 1921 by Jiang Shoufeng (1875-1926), a member of the Confucian Church (孔教会 \"Kǒngjiàohuì\") of Kang Youwei. Kang Youwei himself was the president of the church during the last year of his life. The movement was concerned with a reconstitution of morality, at a time in which people no longer understood what morality means because of the decline of religion. By the 1930s the religion had a strong presence in Manchuria, where it persists to the present day.\n\nA great contribution came from Jiang Shoufeng's son, Jiang Xizhang (1907-2004), an intellectual prodigy who composed commentaries on the Confucian classics before the age of ten. Father and son composed vernacular versions of the classics in order to disseminate Confucianism among the Chinese masses. After the World War I, Xizhang wrote a leaflet, the \"Xizhanlun\" with anti-war teachings inspired by the content of the world religions.\n\nThe strongest impetus in the social importance of the movement, however, came from Wang Fengyi (王凤仪 1864-1937), a charismatic healer and preacher of peasant origins who led the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in the 1930s. He is celebrated as a peasant saint throughout northeast China, a \"shànrén\" (善人 \"virtuous man\") with the epithet \"Wang the Good\" or \"Virtuous King\" (王善人), a wordplay as his surname means \"king\" or \"ruler\".\n\nWang Fengyi elaborated a doctrine and practice based on self-knowledge, self-realisation, and self-reliance, based on traditional Chinese theology and cosmology, especially the five elements (五行 \"wǔxíng\") and the \"yinyang\" cosmology. The five elements constitute everything and also characterise the five behaviours of the human being. The harmony of the person and the society depends on the proper cultivation of these characters according to the different contexts.\n\nShanrendao is deeply influenced by the Taizhou school of Wang Yangming's Neo-Confucianism, but the tradition synthesises the entirety of Chinese religion. Its goal is to find the roots of one's life; return to the principles of the bond between Heaven, Earth and humanity according to one's own experience.\n\nAll kinds of human emotions are thought to arise from social interaction, from the family to the larger community. Wang Fengyi's teachings emphasise the role of emotion in healing. Reconciliation, gathering for ritual and storytelling (parables are taken from the Chinese tradition and the life of Master Wang) able to \"turn the heart of the participants\", are the primary practice of the movement. These methods are called \"talking the disease away by appealing to one's higher nature\".\n\nWang Fengyi's doctrine holds that the human being tends to the five virtues of empathy (仁 \"rén\"), ritual and propriety (礼 \"lǐ\"), integrity and trust (信 \"xìn\"), justice and righteousness (义 \"yì\"), and wisdom (智 \"zhì\"), and to the five vices of anger (怒 \"nù\"), hatred (恨 \"hèn\"), blame (怨 \"yuàn\"), irritation and judgment (恼 \"nǎo\"), and annoyance and disdain (烦 \"fán\"). These tendences take part in the three natures of man, which they characterise more or less.\n\nThe state of virtue is ① \"tiānxìng\" (天性, \"heavenly nature\", which can be translated as \"natural disposition\"), while the outward disposition (meaning the tendency to impose oneself on others) is ② \"bǐngxìng\" (禀性), and it is generally dominated by vices and selfishness. ③ Habits (\"xíxìng\" 习性) are neither of the two, and they are rather engendered by the necessity of interaction with the circumstances, which lead to certain choices and preferences. The aim of Wang's healing is to extinguish imposition of the self on others, and reduce habits, in order to deliver the heavenly nature of humanity. \"Tianxing\" is the state of \"Dào\", and it is the integration and harmony of spirit, body and mind, of nature (性 \"xìng\"), heart (心 \"xīn\") and body (身 \"shēn\").\n\nThe Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue inherited Wang's teachings on the importance of the family, seen as the basis of citizenship and social regeneration. According to Wang's teachings the family institution has to be frugal and morally pure.\n\nWang protested the inadequacy of historical religions, protesting that they neglected or demeaned women. Wang emphasised the importance of the woman in the institution of the family, and the necessity of women's education and independence in the Way. Wang Fengyi promoted an indigenous mass female learning movement which competed with the missionary schools of the Catholic Church in Manchuria.\n\nJiang Shoufeng and his son Jiang Xizhang began to organise the movement in 1916. Jiang Shoufeng was originally a member of Confucian Church of Kang Youwei but was turned away by hard-line Confucian trends within the church. The Jiangs theorised that a moral foundation was needed for the Chinese in order to contrast French, British and Japanese colonialisms, which rested on a policy of destruction of the morality of the conquered populations. The Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue was officially founded on 28 September 1921, the birthday of Confucius, in Tai'an, Shandong.\n\nThe church attracted members from various backgrounds and government officials. Even the American Christian missionary Gilbert Reid became a member of the church, and Kong Decheng (1920-2008), then Confucius' first descendant in direct line, became the honorary chairman. Kang Youwei, the \"Martin Luther of Confucianism\", founder of the Confucian Church, was the president of the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue in 1926-27, the last year of his life.\n\nThe Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue underwent a significant reform in 1926-28 when Jiang Shoufeng died, Kang Youwei was ill and dying, and Jiang Xizhang went abroad. The leadership was taken by a capitalist from Heilongjiang, Du Yannian (1878-1957), who recruited the charismatic healer and preacher Wang Fengyi.\n\nWang Fengyi was born on 1 November 1864 to a peasant family of Wangjiayinzi village, Chaoyang, Rehe (nowadays Liaoning). His parents were Mongolian, and he was primarily a self-taught ox herder. He had an older brother, Wang Shutian (王树田), and two younger brothers, Wang Shushen (王树森) and Wang Shuyong (王树永). At the age of 23 he married Bai Shoukun (白守坤) and they had a son, Wang Guohua (王国华). Wang Fengyi did not receive a high education because of poverty, and at the age of 35 he realised the \"Dao\" and became a wandering healer and preacher of traditional Confucian morality.\n\nBy the time of his contact with Du Yannian, Wang had already founded the Voluntary Schooling movement for girls, which by 1925 had established 250 schools throughout Manchuria. Wang's schools merged with the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, and by 1933 the church had 500 branches, 400 schools and 200.000 students in northeast China.\n\nWang Fengyi gave a great impetus to the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue, which in the 1930s had 8 million members in northeast China (25% of the population). Nowadays he continues to be celebrated as a peasant saint throughout the region, a \"shànrén\" (善人 \"virtuous man\") with the epithet \"Wang the Good\" or \"Virtuous King\" (王善人) as his surname means \"king\" or \"ruler\".\n\nIn mainland People's Republic of China the Universal Church of the Way and its Virtue ceased to exist as a social organisation recognised by political authorities since the Communist Revolution of 1949 until recent decades. Shanrendao persisted as an \"underground\" movement across the Maoist period and the Cultural Revolution.\n\nSince the relaxation of antireligion policies in the 1980s the movement has resurfaced and it has grown back especially in its heartland, northeast China (Manchuria), where the members preach filiality and Wang Fengyi's healing methods, mostly organised in the form of house churches. Lineages of local healers are organised in \"farms\", and successfully employ storytelling, lectures on virtue, personal confessions, and a set of five chanted affirmations modeled on the five elements.\n\nHeadquarters of the \"Church of the Way and its Virtue\" have been established again in Beijing in the 2010s. Wang Fengyi's teachings have also been adopted by the contemporary Beijing Confucian group \"Yīdān xuétáng\" (一耽學堂).\n\n\n\n"}

He writes on a wide variety of topics including: history of philosophy, political theory, religion, ethics, aesthetics, literature, theatre, David Bowie, Hamlet, Suicide, and most recently, Football.\n\nCritchley's PhD dissertation resulted in the monograph \"The Ethics of Deconstruction\" (Blackwell, 1992). This text was published in the wake of a debate at Cambridge concerning Jacques Derrida's honorary doctorate.\n\nCritchley holds the position of \"chief philosopher\" at the International Necronautical Society (INS). A parody of twentieth century avant-garde cultural, artistic, and political organizations, the INS facilitates live events as well as denunciations and proclamations with the intention of \"mapping, entering, and occupying the space of death.\" Archival documents from the INS produced between 1999 and 2010 have been compiled into a text edited by novelist Tom McCarthy and Critchley entitled \"The Mattering of Matter\" (Sternberg Press, 2012).\n\nAside from death, Critchley is also widely known for his encouragement of educating the living, in particular, the philosophical education of children at the Tilt Kids Festival at the Brooklyn Public Library. He is also a regular participant at the Brooklyn Public Library's Night of Philosophy, infamously reserving his lectures until the early hours of the morning.\n\nAn atheist, Critchley has publicly stated that his \"only religious commitment is to Liverpool Football Club.\"\n\nCritchley has taught at the University of Cardiff (1988–89), The University of Essex (1989-2003) and was the Directeur de Programme at the College International de Philosophie in Paris (1998-2004). Critchley was also part-time professor of philosophy at Tilburg University (2009–15). He has held visiting professorships at the University of Sydney, Notre Dame, and Cardozo Law School.\n\nCritchley argues philosophy begins not in wonder, but disappointment. The two major forms of disappointment that he deals with are religious and political. Religious disappointment raises the question of meaning and has to, as he sees it, deal with the problem of nihilism. Political disappointment provokes the question of justice and raises the need for a coherent ethics.\n\nCritchley believes in an \"essential connection between biography and philosophy.\"\n\nHis father was a sheet-metal worker and his mother was a hairdresser. On at least one occasion Critchley has affectionately referred to his hometown as the \"wasteland.\" As a child he was bullied but escaped this violence through study and football. As a young pupil Critchley was admitted into grammar school and then university despite his parents' disinclinations. During his adolescence he split his time between numerous punk bands but at the age of 18 suffered a serious industrial accident which almost severed his left hand. Unable to continue his career in music, Critchley underwent an intense period of depression. Working as a lifeguard one summer he read Beckett, Joyce, Kafka, Camus as well as works in middle English by Chaucer and Piers Plowman. At 22 he applied for college at the behest of a friend and was admitted to study philosophy and literature.\n\nCritchley received a BA from the University of Essex in 1985. At Essex he joined the Communist Students' Society which introduced him to thinkers who would greatly shape his later thought including: Louis Althusser, Michel Foucault, and Jacques Derrida. During this period he quit writing poetry after reading W. H. Auden.\n\nIn 1987 Critchley left Essex for the University of Nice where he met Dominique Janicaud, who would become a last influence and friend. Soon after, Critchley suffered a hospital accident that resulted in lifelong tinnitus. Despite this obstruction, Critchley completed a thesis in French concerning Heidegger and Carnap on the question of overcoming metaphysics. For this achievement he earned his M. Phil.\n\nReturning to Essex in 1987 Critchley was at a loss as to what to write on for his forthcoming dissertation. He eventually completed a dissertation on Derrida and Levinas (which would later be expanded into his monograph, \"The Ethics of Deconstruction\" (Blackwell, 1992)). In 1988 he attained his PhD from Essex. Not long after he was appointed a lecturer of philosophy at Essex in 1989, becoming reader in philosophy in 1995, and professor in 1999.\n\nSince 2004 Critchley has been professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research. He was department chair from 2008-2011 and became Hans Jonas Professor of Philosophy in 2011.\n\n\n\nIn Critchley's 2007 publication \"Infinitely Demanding\" (Verso) he remarks: \"Anarchic political resistance should not seek to mimic and mirror the anarchic violent sovereignty it opposes\" (168). In response, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Zizek responded with a polemical review in the London Review of Books (November 15, 2007). In his review, Zizek criticizes Critchley as defending the liberal-democratic capitalist state. For Zizek, Critchley epitomizes how \"the politics of resistance is nothing but the moralizing supplement to a Third Way Left.\"\n\nT.J. Clark (University of California Berkeley) and David Graeber (Goldsmiths, University of London) defended Critchley by pointing out a variety of Zizek's own vacillations concerning political violence and the state-form; in particular, Clark paraphrases Zizek's own prescription as a \"sit at home and watch the barbarity on television\" attempt at revolution.\n\nZizek responded to his critics in the London Review of Books (vol.30 no.2 – 24 January 2008) by reiterating that his \"opinion is that the left is not able to offer a true alternative to global capitalism.\" Zizek defended his criticism of Critchley in remarking that resistance to the state may indeed vindicate and corroborate it. On this point Zizek remarks in regards to protests against the Iraq War that they \"fitted all too smoothly [into] the space allotted to 'democratic protests' by the hegemonic state and ideological order.\"\n\nIn 2009 Critchley published a response to Zizek in \"Naked Punch.\" There, Critchley links Zizek's rapid production of monographs and prescription that \"sometimes, doing nothing is the most violent thing to do,\" in order to claim that what ultimately sustains Zizek's work is \"a dream of divine violence, cruelty and force.\" Zizek \"ridicules others' attempts at thinking about commitment, resistance and action...while doing nothing himself.\" Critchley concludes:\"There is a serious debate to be had about the question of violence versus non-violence, the necessity of the state form, and the nature of radical politics given the seeming permanence of capitalism. This is a debate in which I’d like to engage as my own position on these matters is shifting as I give it more thought. Perhaps when we get beyond the windy rhetorical posturing of Zizek’s critique and his description of my position as ‘post-modern leftism’ (I defy anyone to find a word in favour of postmodernism in anything I have written), we can begin to have that debate.\"In the final chapter of his 2012 publication, \"The Faith of the Faithless\" (Verso), Critchley returns to his debate with Zizek in order to sum up some of his previously made points and prescribe resistance to systemic forms of oppression, discrimination and domination.\n\nThe Stone\n\nSince May 2010 Critchley has moderated an opinion blog published by \"The New York Times\" entitled \"The Stone.\" The Stone features the writing of contemporary philosophers and other thinkers on issues both timely and timeless including art, war, ethics, gender and popular culture. In 2015 Critchley and co-editor Peter Catapano assembled a compilation of Stone entries into \"The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments\" (Liveright, 2015). This work was followed up in 2017 with another volume co-edited with Catapano entitled \"Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments\" (Liveright, 2017).\n\nGuardian Commentary on Heidegger's \"Being and Time\"\n\nOver June and July 2009 Critchley wrote a serialized read-through of Martin Heidegger's magnum opus, \"Being and Time\" (1927), for the British newspaper, \"The Guardian.'Over two months and eight separate articles, Critchley engages with and disentangles each difficult chapter of this infamously resistant text.\n\nCritchley and Simmons\n\nCritchley is an active and founding collaborator in the avant-garde music group \"Critchley and Simmons.\" The sound of this group is self-described as if \"David Bowie & Jacques Derrida had love children who decided to form a band.\" Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a featured vocalist and collaborator on the track \"So Happy.\" Critchley and Simmons have produced four studio albums: Humiliation (2004), The Majesty of the Absurd (2014), Ponders End (2017) and Moderate or Good, Occasionally Poor (2017).\n\nSpeaking Engagements\n\nCritchley is also a renowned interviewer and has spoken in public engagements with Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Fiona Shaw, Cornel West and Isabelle Huppert, among others.\n\n\n\n"}

The comparison is made by using the copula or linking verb \"is\" or its negative \"is not.\" Therefore, a judgment is a declarative sentence, which is a categorical proposition. Example: The tiger is four-footed. A predicate can also have its own predicate. In the example, the predicate \"four-footed\" can, itself, have the further predicate \"animal.\" One of these predicates is immediately and directly connected to the subject or thing. The other predicate is mediate and indirectly connected to the subject.\n\n\"The tiger ----------is---------- a four-footed---------- animal.\"\n\nIn order to have clear knowledge of the relation between a predicate and a subject, I can consider a predicate to be a mediate predicate. Between this mediate predicate or attribute, I can place an intermediate predicate. For example, in the judgment \"the sun is luminous,\" I attempt a clarification by inserting the predicate \"star,\" which then becomes an immediate predicate, intermediate between the subject \"sun\" and the mediate predicate \"luminous.\" \n\n\"The sun is a star that is luminous.\"\n\nSun = subject\n\nIs = copula\n\nStar = immediate predicate (intermediate predicate) (middle term)\n\nLuminous = remote mediate predicate\n\nKant calls this process ratiocination. It is the comparison of a remote, mediate predicate with a subject through the use of an intermediate predicate. The intermediate predicate is called the middle term of a rational inference. The comparison of a subject with a remote, mediate predicate occurs through three judgments:\nThis can be stated as an affirmative ratiocination: Every star is luminous; the sun is a star; consequently the sun is luminous.\n\nNote: Kant's examples utilized obscure subjects such as Soul, Spirit, and God and their supposed predicates. These do not facilitate easy comprehension because these subjects are not encountered in everyday experience and consequently their predicates are not evident.\n\n\"Of the Supreme Rules of all Ratiocination\"\n\nKant declared that the primary, universal rule of all affirmative ratiocination is: A predicate of a predicate is a predicate of the subject (grammar).\n\nThe primary, universal rule of all negative ratiocination is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. \n\nBecause proof is possible only through ratiocination, these rules can't be proved. Such a proof would assume the truth of these rules and would therefore be circular. However, it can be shown that these rules are the primary, universal rules of all ratiocination. This can be done by showing that other rules, that were thought to be primary, are based on these rules.\n\nThe \"dictum de omni\" is the highest principle of affirmative syllogisms. It says: Whatever is universally affirmed of a concept is also affirmed of everything contained under it. This is grounded on the rule of affirmative ratiocination. A concept that contains other concepts has been abstracted from them and is a predicate. Whatever belongs to this concept is a predicate of other predicates and therefore a predicate of the subject.\n\nThe \"dictum de nullo\" says: Whatever is denied of a concept is also denied of everything that is contained under it. The concept is a predicate that has been abstracted from the concepts that are contained under it. Whatever is inconsistent with this concept is inconsistent with the subject and therefore also with the predicates of the subject. This is based on the rule of negative ratiocination.\n\n\"Of Pure and Mixed Ratiocination\"\n\nIf one judgment can be immediately discerned from another judgment without the use of a middle term, then the inference is not a ratiocination. A direct, non-ratiocinative inference would, for example, be: \"from the proposition that all airplanes have wings, it immediately follows that whatever has no wings is not an airplane.\"\n\nPure ratiocination occurs by means of three propositions. Mixed ratiocination occurs by more than three propositions. A mixed ratiocination is still a single ratiocination. It is not compound, that is, consisting of several ratiocinations. \n\nAn example of a mixed ratiocination is:\n\n\"Nothing immortal is a man,\"\n\n\"Therefore, no man is immortal;\" (this is a negative conversion of the preceding premise)\n\n\"Socrates is a man,\"\n\n\"Therefore, Socrates is not immortal.\"\n\nA mixed ratiocination interposes an immediate inference, resulting in more than three propositions. However, a mixed ratiocination may show only three propositions if the fourth proposition is unspoken, unexpressed, and merely thought. For example, the ratiocination\n\n\"Nothing immortal is a man,\"\n\n\"Socrates is a man,\"\n\n\"Therefore, Socrates is not immortal\"\n\nis only valid if the fourth proposition \"Therefore, no man is immortal\" is covertly thought. This unspoken proposition should be inserted after the first proposition and is merely its negative converse.\n\n\"In the so-called First Figure only Pure Ratiocinations are possible, in the remaining Figures only mixed Ratiocinations are possible. \"\n\nPattern of First Figure:\n\nSubject...Predicate\n\nMiddle Term...Major Term...Major Premise\n\nMinor Term...Middle Term...Minor Premise\n\nMinor Term...Major Term...Conclusion \nA ratiocination is always in the first figure when it accords with the first rule of ratiocination: A predicate B of a predicate C of a subject A is a predicate of the subject A. This is a pure ratiocination. It has three propositions:\n\n\"C has the predicate B,\"\n\n\"A has the predicate C,\"\n\n\"Therefore, A has the predicate B.\"\n\"In the Second Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.\"\n\nPattern of Second Figure:\n\nSubject...Predicate\n\nMajor Term...Middle Term...Major Premise\n\nMinor Term...Middle Term...Minor Premise\n\nMinor Term...Major Term...Conclusion\nThe rule of the second figure is: Whatever is inconsistent with the predicate of a subject is inconsistent with the subject. This is a mixed ratiocination because an unexpressed proposition must be added in thought in order to arrive at the conclusion. If I say,\n\n\"No B is C,\"\n\n\"A is C,\"\n\n\"Therefore, A is not B\"\n\nMy inference is valid only if I silently interpose the immediate inference \"No C is B\" after the first premise. It is merely the negative converse of the first premise. Without it, the ratiocination is invalid.\n\"In the Third Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.\"\n\nPattern of Third Figure:\n\nSubject...Predicate\n\nMiddle Term...Major Term...Major Premise\n\nMiddle Term...Minor Term...Minor Premise\n\nMinor Term...Major Term...Conclusion \nThe rule of the third figure is: Whatever belongs to or contradicts a subject, also belongs to or contradicts some things that are contained under another predicate of this subject.\n\nAn example of a syllogism of the third figure is:\n\n\"All mammals are air-breathers,\"\n\n\"All mammals are animals,\"\n\n\"Therefore, some animals are air-breathers.\"\n\nThis validly follows only if an immediate inference is silently interpolated. The added inference is a conversion that uses the word \"some\" instead of \"all.\"\n\n\"All mammals are air-breathers,\"\n\n\"All mammals are animals,\"\n\n\"Hence, some animals are mammals,\"\n\n\"Therefore, some animals are air-breathers.\"\n\"In the Fourth Figure only mixed Ratiocinations are possible.\"\n\nPattern of Fourth Figure:\n\nSubject...Predicate\n\nMajor Term...Middle Term...Major Premise\n\nMiddle Term...Minor Term...Minor Premise\n\nMinor Term...Major Term...Conclusion \nKant claimed that the fourth figure is based on the insertion of several immediate inferences that each have no middle term. The affirmative mode of this fourth figure is not possible because a conclusion cannot be derived from the premises. The negative mode of this fourth figure is possible only if each premise is immediately followed by its unexpressed, unspoken converse as an immediate inference.\n\nIn order to be valid, the negative mode ratiocination:\n\n\"No stupid man is learned,\"\n\n\"Some learned persons are pious,\"\n\n\"Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid\"\n\nmust become:\n\n\"No stupid man is learned,\"\n\n\"Consequently, no learned person is stupid;\"\n\n\"Some learned persons are pious,\"\n\n\"Consequently, some pious persons are learned,\"\n\n\"Therefore, some pious persons are not stupid.\"\n\n\"The Logical Division of the Four Figures is a Mistaken Subtlety.\"\n\nLegitimate conclusions can be drawn in all four figures. Only the first figure determines the conclusion by pure, unmixed reasoning. The other figures use unspoken, inserted inferences. Logic should consist of open, not covert, reasoning. It should be simple and unmixed, with no hidden inferences.\n\nPrevious logicians incorrectly considered all four figures as being simple and pure. The four figures were created by playfully changing the middle term’s position. This retained the rational conclusion but increased obscurity. Time should not be wasted on the study of the three mixed ratiocinations.\n\n\"Concluding Observation.\"\n\nThe first figure yields a correct inference in a simple, direct manner. The other figures yield a correct inference indirectly by the addition of hidden inferences. They can be changed into the simpler first figure by changing the position of the middle term.\n\nKant concluded the essay with several related remarks.\n\nDistinct and complete concepts are only possible by means of judgments and ratiocinations. A distinct concept is one which is made clear by a judgment. This occurs when something is clearly recognized as a predicate of a subject. A complete concept is one which is made distinct by a ratiocination. The ratiocination can be simple or a chain of reasoning. \n\nThe ability to understand and the ability to reason are both based on the ability to judge. Understanding is the immediate recognition that something is a predicate of a subject. Reason is the ability to judge mediately. It recognizes another predicate in the first predicate, thus conceiving a subject indirectly by means of a remote predicate.\n\nHigher knowledge is based on judging. Framing a judgment is a reflection that results in a distinct concept. Non-human animals can have clear representations of things that are predicates of a subject. Humans can also have knowledge that a predicate is a predicate of a subject and are therefore able to make a judgment. Non-human animals can distinguish things from one another. The different ideas are the causes of their actions, which are irrational. Humans can logically distinguish between things by means of judgment. The higher knowledge of a human is based on the ability to make our own ideas the object of our thoughts. \n\nAll affirmative judgments are based on the principle of Identity. A subject is identical to its predicate. All negative judgments have the principle of Contradiction as their foundation. A subject is opposed to its predicate. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is mediately known, by means of intermediate predicates and by means of the analysis of concepts, are provable. Judgments in which identity or contradiction is immediately known cannot be proved (See Section II). These unprovable judgments precede definitions because we must recognize a subject's predicate before we can define the subject.\n\nKant summed up his thoughts on this topic in a short footnote that appeared in the second edition of the \"Critique of Pure Reason\", B141. He had been discussing the definition of judgment in general. Logicians had usually defined it as a relation between two concepts. Kant disagreed because, he claimed, only categorical judgments are so defined. Hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are a relation between two judgments. \n\nIn his footnote, Kant asserted that the lengthy and detailed doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerned only categorical syllogisms or inferences. He stated that this doctrine is only an artifice or trick for giving the appearance that there are three more kinds of inference or modes of drawing a conclusion than that of the first figure. This is done surreptitiously by secretly concealing immediate inferences in the premises of a pure syllogism. The only reason that this was generally accepted, Kant remarked, was that the logicians had made people believe that all of the other kinds of judgments could be reduced to being categorical judgments. Kant claimed to have disproved this in his Critique, A 73. There he argued that a categorical judgment relates two concepts, whereas a hypothetical or disjunctive judgment relates two judgments.\n\n"}

Bush to advise his administration on bioethics. Established on November 28, 2001, by Executive Order , the Council was directed to \"advise the President on bioethical issues that may emerge as a consequence of advances in biomedical science and technology\". It succeeded and largely replaced the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1996, which expired in 2001.\n\nThe members of the council were appointed directly by the President; the President also chose the chairperson of the Council (last appointed Chair was Edmund D. Pellegrino). Council members, totaling no more than 18, were appointed for a two-year term, after which time they could be reappointed by the President. Individuals appointed could not be officers or employees of the federal government. Executive Order 13237 was renewed in 2003, 2005 and again in 2007.\n\nIn June 2009, President Barack Obama's administration informed members of the Council that their services were no longer needed. Through a spokesperson, Obama made clear that he intended to replace the committee with a body that \"offers practical policy options\" rather than philosophical guidance.\n\nExecutive Order 13521 of November 24, 2009 superseded the previous council by establishing the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues. On Wednesday, Nov. 25, 2009, Obama named Amy Gutmann, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, to chair his new advisory panel on bioethics. James W. Wagner, the president of Emory University, was appointed vice chairperson.\n\nCritics have questioned the motives and goals of the PCBE. Elizabeth Blackburn, who was dismissed from the Commission, co-authored an article, citing examples published by other members, suggesting that it was set up to justify President Bush's positions on stem cell research and abortion, writing \"...our concern is that some of their contents... may have ended up distorting the potential of biomedical research and the motivation of some of its researchers.\"\n\nBioethicist Leslie A. Meltzer accused the Council of wrapping \"political and religious agendas in the guise of dignity,\" and described them as largely Christian-affiliated neoconservatives; philosophers and political scientists rather than bench scientists. Meltzer said that Council members mischaracterized the positions of their opponents and used invective rather than addressing the merits of the arguments.\n\nThe response to President Obama's decision to disband the Council drew both criticism and praise. Colleen Carroll Campbell, a former speechwriter for President Bush and a member of the conservative advocacy group \"Ethics and Public Policy Center\" predicted that \"Obama's desire to see his policies backed by expert 'consensus' more likely will be realized with a new commission composed of like-minded political liberals steeped in utilitarianism than with the brainy, diverse and unpredictable crew that populated the now-defunct council.\" In contrast, Jacob M. Appel of New York's Mount Sinai Hospital wrote that \"the panel itself, far from being an incubator of intellectual ferment, had evolved into a publicly funded right-wing think tank with a handful of token moderates for window dressing\" and argued that \"Obama was wise to scrap the entire panel and to start over.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "11336559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11336559", "title": "Traveler's dilemma", "text": "Traveler's dilemma\n\nIn game theory, the traveler's dilemma (sometimes abbreviated TD) is a type of non-zero-sum game in which two players attempt to maximize their own payoff, without any concern for the other player's payoff.\n\nThe original game scenario was formulated in 1994 by Kaushik Basu and goes as follows:\n\n\"An airline loses two suitcases belonging to two different travelers. Both suitcases happen to be identical and contain identical antiques. An airline manager tasked to settle the claims of both travelers explains that the airline is liable for a maximum of $100 per suitcase—he is unable to find out directly the price of the antiques.\"\n\n\"To determine an honest appraised value of the antiques, the manager separates both travelers so they can't confer, and asks them to write down the amount of their value at no less than $2 and no larger than $100. He also tells them that if both write down the same number, he will treat that number as the true dollar value of both suitcases and reimburse both travelers that amount. However, if one writes down a smaller number than the other, this smaller number will be taken as the true dollar value, and both travelers will receive that amount along with a bonus/malus: $2 extra will be paid to the traveler who wrote down the lower value and a $2 deduction will be taken from the person who wrote down the higher amount. The challenge is: what strategy should both travelers follow to decide the value they should write down?\"\n\nOne might expect a traveler's optimum choice to be $100; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's maximum allowed price. Remarkably, and, to many, counter-intuitively, the Nash equilibrium solution is in fact just $2; that is, the traveler values the antiques at the airline manager's \"minimum\" allowed price.\n\nFor an understanding of why $2 is the Nash equilibrium consider the following proof:\n\n\nAnother proof goes as follows:\n\nThe ($2, $2) outcome in this instance is the Nash equilibrium of the game. By definition this means that if your opponent chooses this Nash equilibrium value then your best choice is that Nash equilibrium value of $2. This will not be the optimum choice if there is a chance of your opponent choosing a higher value than $2. When the game is played experimentally, most participants select a value higher than the Nash equilibrium and closer to $100 (corresponding to the Pareto optimal solution). More precisely, the Nash equilibrium strategy solution proved to be a bad predictor of people’s behavior in a traveler's dilemma with small bonus/malus and a rather good predictor if the bonus/malus parameter was big.\n\nFurthermore, the travelers are rewarded by deviating strongly from the Nash equilibrium in the game and obtain much higher rewards than would be realized with the purely rational strategy. These experiments (and others, such as focal points) show that the majority of people do not use purely rational strategies, but the strategies they do use are demonstrably optimal. This paradox could reduce the value of pure game theory analysis, but could also point to the benefit of an expanded reasoning that understands how it can be quite rational to make non-rational choices, at least in the context of games that have players that can be counted on to not play \"rationally.\" For instance, Capraro has proposed a model where humans do not act a priori as single agents but they forecast how the game would be played if they formed coalitions and then they act so as to maximize the forecast. His model fits the experimental data on the Traveler's dilemma and similar games quite well. Recently, the traveler's dilemma was tested with decision undertaken in groups rather than individually, in order to test the assumption that groups decisions are more rational, delivering the message that, usually, two heads are better than one. Experimental findings show that groups are always more rational – i.e. their claims are closer to the Nash equilibrium - and more sensitive to the size of the bonus/malus.\n\nOne variation of the original traveler's dilemma in which both travelers are offered only two integer choices, $2 or $3, is identical mathematically to the Prisoner's dilemma and thus the traveler's dilemma can be viewed as an extension of prisoner's dilemma. The traveler's dilemma is also related to the game Guess 2/3 of the average in that both involve deep iterative deletion of dominated strategies in order to demonstrate the Nash equilibrium, and that both lead to experimental results that deviate markedly from the game-theoretical predictions.\n\nThe canonical payoff matrix is shown below (if only integer inputs are taken into account):\n\nDenoting by formula_1 the set of strategies available to both players and by formula_2\nthe payoff function of one of them we can write\n(Note that the other player receives formula_4 since the game is quantitatively symmetric).\n"}

His book \"Academical Questions\" (1805) is arguably important in the development of the ideas of English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley.\n\nHe was born in Perthshire the son of John Drummond of Perth and educated at both St Andrew's University and Oxford University.\n\nIn 1798 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposers being Dugald Stewart, Alexander Keith and John Playfair. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London the following year.\n\nHe lived in London from 1809 and died in Rome in Italy on 29 March 1828.\n\nIn 1795 he was MP for St. Mawes, and in the elections of 1796 and 1801 was returned for Lostwithiel. These were both rotten boroughs in Cornwall. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1799 He became sworn as a Privy Counsellor in 1801, and left Parliament as a diplomat, as Envoy to the court of Naples.\n\nIn 1803 he became British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Appointed by the Levant Company on 14 January 1803, he arrived at the Dardanelles the following May. He was there for less than a year and then he returned to England in 1804. From 1806 to 1809 he served as Envoy to the Court of Naples for a second time.\n\nHe was knighted in 1813 or 1814.\n\nThe French writer Hippolyte Auger entered his service in Italy.\n\nThe title of Drummond's book refers to the \"later\" Platonic Academy, which was, in fact, not so much Platonist as Sceptical in orientation, based on the work of Pyrrho the Sceptic and later followers of Pyrrho such as Carneades. \"Academical Questions\" is a work in the Sceptic tradition, in this case influenced by the Sceptical Scottish philosopher David Hume.\n\nAccording to C. E. Pulos's 1954 book \"The Deep Truth: A Study of Shelley's Scepticism\", Drummond uses Sceptical Humean ideas in an attempt to refute the British philosophy predominant in his day, the Common Sense ideas of Thomas Reid and his followers. These had been enunciated first in Reid's \"An Enquiry into the Human Mind\" (1765).\n\nDrummond failed to unseat Reid's ideas in popularity; they remained dominant in English philosophy for the first half of the 19th century.\n\nThe well-known quotation: \"He, who will not reason is a bigot; he who cannot, is a fool; and he, who dares not, is a slave\", originates in the preface of this book. \n\nIn contrast to other scholars he names, Pulos argues that Shelley was decisively influenced by \"Academical Questions\", and under its influence confidently abandoned 18th-century French materialism. According to Pulos, Drummond altered the poet Shelley's beliefs. He ceased being an 18th-century French materialist; Shelley asserted that some passions (of the heart) are \"innate.\"\n\nHis \"Oedipus Judaicus\" references the \"Oedipus Aegyptiacus\" of Athanasius Kircher, and was printed for private circulation. It was reprinted in 1866, having proved highly controversial (introduction to 1986 reprint by James P. Carley). It interprets passages from the \"Book of Genesis\" (in particular the Chedorlaomer story), and the \"Book of Joshua\", in allegorical fashion, with a detailed argument based on astrology.\n\n\n"}
